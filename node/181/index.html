  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Ok, so making continuous optical adjustments to the individual character widths in a typeface I&#39;m working on is taking forever. Is there a more <i>scientific</i> way of doing it than looking at the letters in context &#40;words, text&#41;, making &#40;subjective&#41; judgements about their legibility, adjusting accordingly and then repeating the cycle? <BR> <BR>There seems to be an &#40;inate?&#41; optimal width for each glyph. If a glyph is too wide it <i>looks wrong</i> and is distracting. This <i>sense</i> of what is ideal is what I&#39;m trying to use as a benchmark against which to make adjustments. But isnt that a bit too subjective? <BR> <BR>Where does this sense come from? Have our eyes just become accustomed to reading letters at a certain width, or is there an actual optimal width at which each character imparts its information and can thereby be recognisable? &#40;Perhaps related to the number of vertical strokes in a chracter, for example&#41; <BR> <BR>How does you design legibility &#40;as regards charcter widths specifically&#41; into an original typeface? Is it just optical adjustments or is there a more objective way? <BR> <BR>je</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jumping in as a relative newcomer: <BR> <BR>An important factor might be where in the spectrum from classical proportions to monospaced proportions a typeface lies. <BR> <BR>A classical font like Trajan is built on the forms of the circle, the square, and the triangle. The result is that some letters, like O and C &#40;based on the circle&#41; are twice as wide as letters like E and L &#40;based on two squares&#41;. <BR> <BR>With a typeface like DIN, on the other hand, all letters strive to look the same width. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s plenty of room in between, but I expect that the classical proportions should give you a good idea of relative widths between letters. Applying this to lowercase might be another matter. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed, there seem to be two models of UC width: the Classical with its great divergence&#42;, and what might be called the Modern with its convergence. But I&#39;m not sure how much there is in between. You do see some faces with a letter or two deviating from the Classical &#40;like the wide &#34;S&#34; of Will Carter and sometimes Zapf, and a wide &#34;E&#34;/&#34;F&#34; here and there&#41;, but I can&#39;t think of any that deviate much from the Modern - I guess that would look totally lousy. What I&#39;m saying is that your caps have to either diverge a lot or not at all&#42;&#42;. Makes sense? <BR> <BR>&#42; Although I&#39;m not sure how strong the geometric basis is. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; The only exception I can think of is Nick Shinn&#39;s fascinating Richler. <BR> <BR>So Jos</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Back to the original issue: <BR> <BR>&#62; There seems to be an &#40;inate?&#41; optimal width for each glyph. <BR> <BR>It seems that the optimal width for a given character is a value that can be deviated from safely, upto a point. This point depends on the sensibilities of the viewer &#40;which is subjective&#41;. Furthemore, the deviation can be controlled to make the font more dynamic. However, the <i>set</i> of deviations might have to be consistent, otherwise the harmony is too deep, and it will be seen as discord by practically everybody. What I mean is you can&#39;t make half the UC Classical and the other Modern. <BR> <BR>As for what the &#34;ideal&#34; is, I would say it depends on the structure of the glyph. One obvious example is the &#34;B&#34; versus the &#34;D&#34;: the former is narrower because you can&#39;t make half-size bowls look nice that wide. But it&#39;s not so simple because a &#34;B&#34; with bowls of [roughly] equal height can&#39;t be as wide as one with a large lower bowl. <BR> <BR>So there might be a way to quantify the optimal widths of characters by first quantifying their structure, <i>but</i> taste is subjective, so you could only do that for a given person &#40;and really only at a given instant&#41;. So what you could do is make a set of caps where the widths please you personally, then make variations of certain characters &#40;like make a &#34;B&#34; with a lower/higher middle&#41; and see how that affects your ideal width, and formulate some numbers for future use. So the next time you make a font, you can draw a single character and &#34;propagate&#34; the ideal widths of all the others, based on their other structural determinants. Once you have the set of ideal widths, you would work inwards. <BR> <BR>To avoid making the solution too personal, you could do this to a &#34;classic&#34; face. For example, you could take the Trajan &#34;B&#34;, lower the middle, see how its ideal width changes, and use that dataset as the guide for a new font. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>This is exactly the sort of thread I think type design needs most now. So I hope many people brainstorm about it and delve deeply towards its warm core. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">To an individual, sure. But when it comes to pleasing others &#40;which I think is the heart of type design&#41;, you have to think about it some more.

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; Time for something else. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m all for that! <BR> <BR>But just to make sure: we <i>are</i> talking about the widths <BR>that glyphs conform to, right? Not letterform style. <BR> <BR>What do people think of Richler&#39;s caps, <BR>especially in terms of the widths scheme? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Something new, eh? Hmmm... What about this: <BR> <BR>Since letters are put together to form words, and we can appreciate the way a word sets as much as the way a letter sits, the set of optimal widths in a writing system depends on linguistics. If the Classical widths are seen as optimal for ancient Roman inscriptions &#40;in Latin&#41;, they simply can&#39;t be seen as optimal for a contemporary novel. So maybe we need a new set of widths? <BR> <BR>That said: <BR>1&#41; There are -as I&#39;m fond of stating- two strands of reading: deliberative &#40;where you can consciously appreciate shapes&#41; versus immersive &#40;where your reading &#34;firmware&#34; takes over, and doesn&#39;t care how sexy that finial is&#41;. As a result, &#34;optimal widths&#34; can be [at least] two things... <BR>2&#41; I&#39;ve only thought about caps so far... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I found something. An article in the 1968 Penrose Annual &#40;which I actually mentioned in the &#34;Trapping&#34; thread&#41; by Louis Rosenblum, where he&#39;s devised a system to standardize the measure of the relative widths of text fonts. The apparent aim being to be able to predict layout and/or save on storage &#40;remember: 1968&#41;. <BR> <BR>Rosenblum&#39;s style is very terse &#40;he&#39;s an engineer by training&#41;, so I&#39;m not exactly sure, but it looks like he&#39;s taken measurements of many &#34;classic&#34; fonts and arrived at average relative widths: <BR> <BR>Lowercase: <BR> 5: i <BR> 6: f j l <BR> 7: r s t <BR> 8: z e c <BR> 9: q g x a o <BR>10: n h u d p b k y v <BR>13: w <BR>15: m <BR> <BR>Uppercase: <BR> 8: I <BR> 9: J <BR>10: S <BR>11: Z <BR>12: P L F <BR>13: Q O A V B T E C <BR>14: G U Y R <BR>15: N H X D K <BR>18: M W <BR> <BR>Numerals: 9 units. <BR> <BR>One strange thing is that for a given width the letters listed aren&#39;t alphabetical. But there must be a reason behind their orders. My guess is that they&#39;re listed in increasing statistical divergence from the given width. <BR> <BR>Rosenblum also ties the TTS width system into the discussion, but I couldn&#39;t follow that well enough. <BR> <BR>One last thing <BR>In pointing out that metal fonts have smaller sizes that are proportionally wider and darker than the larger ones &#40;optical scaling&#41;, he says that&#39;s due to practical manufacturing concerns! I&#39;d never heard that before. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
