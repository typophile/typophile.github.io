body: "I am currently in the market to purchase a new desktop scanner. Many of the
  reviews name the CanoScan and Epson. I am not going to be scanning any negatives,
  so that isn't a crucial factor in my final decision. I have used a CanoScan Lide
  60 and an Agfa Snapscan 1212u. The CanoScan interface was clunky compared to the
  SnapScan. The SnapScan software gave you the ability to select several small areas
  individually on a page and scan them as opposed to scanning an entire page. I found
  that to be very helpful as I do a lot of thumbnail sketching. However, it was loud.
  Obnoxiously loud, to be more precise.\r\n\r\nDo any of you have any suggestions
  on a good scanner? I'm not all that technically advanced and was wondering what
  ever happened to scanning from within Photoshop. That was another thing I liked
  about the SnapScan. It can with a driver that allowed you to do so. As far as I
  know, the CanoScan does not allow to scan from Photoshop. Am I wrong?\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  thank you very much for your time and any assistance you may provide.\r\n"

  body: I have a CanoScan 4400F. I don't do a lot of scanning, but I've been pretty
    happy with this machine. It is possible to run the CanoScan from within Photoshop,
    via the File/Import function.

  body: "I\u2019m very happy with the Canon Lide series. They are small, fast enough
    and do not need a extra power brick. \r\n\r\nYou need to switch to Advanced Mode
    in the scanning software to be able to select the scanning area... And it works
    with Photoshop. \r\n\r\nG"

    like Mr. Hudson said, the scanning process is a breeze via Photoshop."

  body: I have the CanoScan 5000F, it's already a few years old, but I think it's
    an excellent scanner. I'm sure you can get a newer scanner in the same series
    that is also good.

  body: "I got a refurbished low-end Epson model for around $100 shipped from Epson.com.
    The scan quality is great, it\u2019s fast and quiet, and I think Epson makes some
    of the best scanner software around. Unless you\u2019re scanning photographs for
    high-end book design you just don\u2019t need to spend a lot on a scanner these
    days, it\u2019s more important to just avoid really crappy brands (don\u2019t
    buy HP!)."

  body: "I sincerely appreciate all the feedback.\r\n\r\n@Reetsde: You're point about
    being USB powered is an excellent one and very well received. I never thought
    about the power adapter. I'm all for reducing cable clutter.\r\n\r\n@John Hudson/Reetsde/mk2:
    I'm currently borrowing a CanoScan and tried to scan directly from Photoshop with
    no luck.  Back in the day, File>Import>Twain and away you went. However, with
    the CanoScan Toolbox, I have to use its interface and it will automatically open
    the image in Photoshop. Is this what you were referring to?\r\n\r\n@James: I owned
    an Epson ink jet printer that I was really happy with until it finally stopped
    working. It served me very well and I have no complaints. I never really thought
    of them as being an option until you and mk2 suggested to look at them.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I have an old Epson 1200 Photo with a removable part for negatives/slides.
    It has served me very well and allows me to scan from Photoshop. The place to
    go is exactly then one you're showing, perhaps there's a driver missing, as you
    said.
