  body: Ooooh, many, but I&#39;ll restrict myself to a couple of lesser known options.
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_oxtail.html" target="_blank">
    Oxtail</a> is subtly different, a contemporary take on Clarendon. <BR> <BR><a
    href="http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/fantabular/pk_fantabular.htm" target="_blank">
    Fantabular</a> is monospaced, which opens up a lot of design possibilities. <BR>
    <BR><a href="http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/html_pages/SilicaOverview.html" target="_blank">
    Silica</a> is an often overlooked little gem by Sumner Stone. <BR> <BR><a href="http://thirstype.com/fonts.php?font=ApexSerif"
    target="_blank"> ApexSerif</a> is so contemporary it hurts. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=255"
    target="_blank"> Charifa</a> is very geometric, inspired by Bauhaus. <BR> <BR><a
    href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=789" target="_blank"> Aminta</a>
    is a re-interpretation of the typewriter style. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=570"
    target="_blank"> Barbera</a> is nice&#39;n&#39;quirky. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=452&amp;dw=237"
    target="_blank"> Aurea Ultra</a> has only one weight, but with a killer italic.
    <BR> <BR>Tell me if you need more options.

  body: Thanks. Some nice faces there, but not quite what I&#39;m after. It&#39;s
    for a magazine masthead and I&#39;m trying to find a face that will stretch the
    letters &#39;ICE&#39; across an A4 without going too deep into the page. Was looking
    for something like Aachen but with more character any other inspired ideas??

  body: If it&#39;s just those 3 letters and a magazine masthead I&#39;d say why not
    draw them yourself? <BR> <BR>Also look at <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PBaSeB.html"
    target="_blank">Base 12</a>. <BR> <BR>Yves, that Oxtail is really nice! Know where
    I can get a free version? &#40;just kidding&#41;

  body: I haven&#39;t figured out how to add a smiley yet. It took me months to learn
    how to add html to the links... <BR> <BR>I have a book cover which appears to
    have Clarendon Italic on it - which I know does not exist. I tracked it down finally
    to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/belizio/" target="_blank">Belizio</a>.

    a little too traditional. Looking more to Officina Serif at the moment. '

    rather condensed.
