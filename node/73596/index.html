<p>People who can barely read never seem to have much trouble with the tiny, tightly-spaced, all-caps text in comic books, which suggests to me that all-caps is quite easy to read. Design pundits make a big deal about the differences in legibility and readability of lowercase and all-caps settings, but the differences are measured in fractions of a second. So if you aren’t typesetting long copy, highway signage, or wayfinding systems then the difference is probably irrelevant. Of course one still needs to consider that many typefaces and a great deal of content will look like crap in all caps no matter how well one typesets it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Years ago I read that comparison studies had been done that compared reading speed and comprehension, but I don&rsquo;t have links to them.</p>
<p>I think most graphic designers believe that sentences set in all caps are harder to read. It&rsquo;s not significant if you&rsquo;re just dealing with a few words (like a headline), but a paragraph in all caps is harder to read.</p>
<p>In fact a trick that designers occasionally do is that if you&rsquo;ve got some text that must be included but your client DOESN&rsquo;T want people to actually read it  &ndash; like some bad news in an annual report &ndash; you put it in justified block paragraphs in all caps.  You&rsquo;d think that all caps would draw more attention to it, but lots of folks will give up reading after the first few sentences of all caps.</p>

It&rsquo;s all about context.
Although all-caps is not considered &ldquo;as readable&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s because the gold standard/acid test of readability is assumed to be books.
But for many other genres of typography, it&rsquo;s just fine.
In fact, all-caps is easier to read when leading is tight; check out the rock band pages in your local entertainment paper.</div>

<p>Exactly. Readability is just one of many factors when creating a design.  For a book or long article, it&rsquo;s extremely important. For smaller amounts of text, other factors may be a higher priority. And it&rsquo;s not important at all in a psychedelic poster. :)</p>

<p>But my point is that Owens' part is written in UPPERCASE, because of his unusual voice. And in my personal opinion, READING UPPER CASE JUST TOOK ME LONGER than lower case with the rest of the book. And that was the point for using UPPER CASE.</p>
<p>Upper case is made for headlines, and lower case is for reading. I believe history has shown it.</p>

<p>I suspect it has more to do with conserving space within speech balloons: with the exception of Q, uppercase letters have no descenders, so you can pack a lot more dialogue into a smaller space with all caps. Plus, this approach eliminates having to make decisions about which words should be capitalized, and which need not. And, finally, there&rsquo;s no equivocation about whether or mot a single vertical stroke represents an L or an I&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We can agree that lowercase is easier to read than all caps. The question is why. Two basic themes: A) Our optical neural wiring processes lowercase better (in the same way that our optical wiring is more sensitive to motion than color) or B) we read more lowercase and we&rsquo;re acclimated to it. That&rsquo;s not an issue of cognitive physiology / psychology, just an issue of habit.</p>
<p>@Christopher Dean</p>
<p>I am writing about the legibility of lowercase vs. all caps and one of my editors asked whether &ldquo;word shape&rdquo; was an accepted cognitive science theory, and pointed to this</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx</a></p>

<p>I agree with all that—and in addition, the larger counters in capital letters are less likely to fill with in when printed on cheap newsprint. I just used that example to show that even under fairly crummy conditions text in all caps is still quite easy to read.</p>
