  body: "That lettering brought to my mind immediately Cartoon Bold (Howard Allen
    Trafton, 1936). I don't know why no one has made a mainstream digital version
    of this, because it is still seen in use all the time.\r\n\r\nThere <em>are</em>
    digital version out there, including David Rakowski's <a href=\"http://www.faces.co.uk/fonts/Intecsas/Adineski-Bold-IN20125/\"
