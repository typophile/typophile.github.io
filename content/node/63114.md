  body: "The S serifs are not like most of the 'football' styles I can think of. I
    thought maybe TheSerif Black would be close, but the S shape seems different.
    Most slab serifs have no serif on the middle arm of the E. Amasis is another possibility
    for something similar, but the E middle serif is missing at the Black weight.\r\n\r\n-
