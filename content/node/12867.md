  v1.0 ate a bunch of my system fonts, so I dare not try it myself!\r\n\r\nAnyone
  care to render an opinion? Can Font Book v2.0 handle (say) upwards of 1,000 fonts

  body: "On Panther, Apple's FontBook was inusable with more than \"a few dozen\"
    fonts since it simply moved fonts in and out from /Library/Fonts/ folder, slowing
    down the machine.\r\n\r\nI recently upgraded to Tiger, had problems with my old
    Font Reserve app, and I'm trying to move to a different font manager. \r\nNow,
    I'm quite pissed off.\r\n\r\nDowloaded demos:\r\n\r\nSuitcase X11, installs correctly,
    crashes on startup (this happened also in Panther - worked well with Jaguar).
    Trashed.\r\n\r\nI'm trying FontAgentPro (idea from: http://typographi.com/000992.php).\r\nYesterday
    it worked quite well, then today I activated Helvetica and HelveticaNeue: it seems
    in causes problem with the system-wide helvetica, that now renders as cirillic
    caracters in Mail.app (it happened before with Panther, but a \"verify privileges\"
    cycle used to resolve the problem): so I'm unable to activate other Helveticas
    on my machine.\r\nAnd now, every font I import into FontAgentPro, is misteriously
    listed as minion...\r\nAuto Activation doesn't work for Photoshop...\r\nFontAgent
    Pro could be a killer app, but (the demo) seems to be filled with bugs that render
    the app nearly inusable...\r\n (PS: found this: http://www.typomancy.org/2005/05/03/a-tally-of-type-management-bugs-fontagent-pro-needs-help/)\r\n\r\nI'm
    going to try Font Book... but I don't think it will help in any way.\r\n\r\nPlease
    HELP ;)\r\nNeed a decent Font Manager...\r\nForum Search not working in this Beta
    version... I'll manually check old posts ;)"

  body: "Apple's Font Book is an incredible application for font management. Simple,
    well integrated through out the system, and contains all the basic tools needed
    to manage fonts on the mac. \r\n\r\nI find the other offerings \u2014 mainly Suitcase
    and Font Reserve \u2014 to be bloated programs that do so much, but nothing well.\r\n\r\nFont
    Book manages Fonts. Thats it. And it does a great job.\r\n\r\nThe only downside
    to Font Book is no auto-activation, but there are ways around it. Plus I am sure
    there are Apple Scripts out there that take care of that problem.\r\n\r\nGive
    Font Book a try. It is a very good Application. The main reason I want from 10.2
    - 10.3.\r\n\r\n\u2014 Jer"

    body: "Hey, Jer:\r\n\r\nThanks for your input. A question, though: have you used
      font book with more than, say, a couple hundred fonts? \r\n\r\nI personally
      have had poor experiences w Suitcase and Font Reserve. FontAgent Pro is much
      better, but i'm seriously wondering if i can use ONLY Apple's Font Book app.
      I've got 850 fonts right now.\r\n\r\nWhat say?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nChris"

  body: "One difference I've noticed is that the new font book copies active fonts
    to the user library, leaving the original copies wherever you had them stored
    before. I think before it would obnoxiously remove the fonts from their original
    location when you installed them.\r\n\r\nAlso it distinguishes between the user
    font library and the system font library, which is nice if you want to keep the
    faces you've installed seperate from system and web-browser fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not one to try activating 2000 fonts at a time, but I've found that the new Font
    Book is easier to work with if you want to maintain your font collection externally,
    and use Font Book to manage the fonts you use on a regular basis or happen to
    be using at the time.\r\n\r\nCameron"
