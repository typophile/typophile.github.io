  saw a deal online with Dreamhost that gives me $20 off.  Is this good?  Does dreamhost
  do everything?"

    online sources/forums/boards. <em>(BUT \u2014 I never used them myself, so this
    is just what I 'heard' and read.)</em>\r\n\r\nI may as well recommend <a href=\"http://namecheap.com\"
    target=\"_blank\">NameCheap</a> <em>(for 'regular' domains)</em> and <a href=\"http://pipni.com\"
    target=\"_blank\">Pipni</a> <em>(for inexpensive and solid hosting)</em>.\r\n\r\n<em>(Typophile
    is hosted by MediaTemple, for example.)</em>"

    secure BSD servers and great customer support.

  body: 'Mediatemple has a big custom server architecture that went bonkers over a
    recent weekend. That sort of thing is pretty atypical, and I would imagine that
    most shared hosting providers are susceptible to it given how complex those can
    be. '

  body: "Dreamhost will likely suit your needs. Their offerings are best suited to
    sites that don't get a *lot* of traffic (this being in excess of 100,000 visitors
    daily). \r\n\r\nI've hosted a number of sites with them for many years and couldn't
    be more pleased with the level of service for the price. Mediatemple is another
    solid host (which I also use), but the real advantages of their offerings aren't
    realized until you need to handle really substantial traffic or database loads.
    I'm talking about volume that's inappropriate for their less expensive packages.\r\n\r\nThings
    look bleak when you research hosts of a reasonable size online. The most vocal
    customer in that business is the upset customer during a temporary outage. Happy
    customers typically have little reason to say so.  \r\n\r\nIf you're not really
    sure and you're deciding between these two, go with Dreamhost. If you outgrow
    them, it's fairly trivial to migrate to another host like Mediatemple when the
    need arises. "
