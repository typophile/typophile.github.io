  true that the Anaheim Ducks (formerly The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim) have more Canadian
  players than the Sens.\r\n\r\nBut more important than that, the Ducks have Teemu
  Selanne, the pride of Helsinki, drafted by my Winnipeg Jets fifteen years ago, who
  finally gets to have his name engraved on Lord Stanley's mighty cup.\r\n\r\nAs a
  proud Winnipegger, I am very pleased to acknowledge the superiority of the Ducks
  and Teemu over the Sens.  Our dog, Spot, the miniature English Bull Terrier and
  serious Montreal Canadiens fan who has a sophomore card of Saku Koivu, also woofs
  her approval for all Suomi hockey players.  \r\n\r\nOnly three months until training
  camp.  ;-)\r\n\r\n(Let us now all stand and hum the <a href=\"http://www.hockeytheme.com/FrameRHistory.htm\"><em>Hockey
  Night in Canada</em></a> theme.)\r\n\r\n"

    local papers this morning. He's the sixth Finn to get the ring.\r\nhttp://www.hs.fi/\r\n\r\nThere
    was a bit of competition for a sporting headline, since Finland beat Belgium in
    football (soccer) last night. An unusual thing happened during that game when
    a huge owl stopped the game for six minutes, by landing on the goal to rest."

    has a nest there and all.

  body: I love hockey...but I do wonder if a shorter playoff season might help the
    ratings a little. I gave up on following the playoffs weeks ago...and that was
    the halfway point!

    change craziness they've been doing, I think they've missed the obvious: a huge

    trying to watch it) look forward to those sixteen games all year. In hocky the
    first sixteen games are a warmup to decide who goes back to the farm team for
    the first half of the season. \r\n\r\nAlthough only having two superstar players
    in the entire league, one of whom is not especially well-liked outside of Washington,
    isn\u2019t helping. "

  body: Nothing against the Ducks, but I had the misfortune last night to have to
    drive home down Katella Avenue past the Honda Pond, er, Center about a half hour
    before the game started. Traffic is bad enough here without a repeat of THAT.
    Sometimes I <strong>really</strong> need a roof-mounted Gatling. Although I do
    wonder who was in the limo with the "MVP2004" plates.
