  a positive ID?\r\n\r\nI think the Logotext is FFDin but what the heck is the body
  text?\r\n\r\nHave attached some images. Have a look.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nArjun\r\n"

  body: "The body text is giving me a Myriad vibe, but it's kind of small to say for
    sure.\r\n\r\nTitles / pull quotes are looking like some Clarendon, FWIW. Maybe
    the Bitstream version rather than Adobe.\r\n\r\nI'm not \"positive\" about any
    of this."

  body: "Dunno about the Myriad idea. For one thing what I see has an obliqued Roman
    and not a true italic. Is it possible the image is the Adobe Sans substitution
    font? I agree about the Clarendon serif, but there is such a large number of Clarendon's
    that isolating the specific one is probably not worth the trouble.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: 'Whoa, you''re right about the obliqued Roman. I was mainly looking at the
    italic in Bak3.jpg, which is an italic (and to me, looks quite close to Myriad).
    I didn''t look at the others closely enough after that. '

  body: "Okay someone please educate me... I always thought that obliqued was the
    same as italics. AN i checked the typeface, the body text font is definately not
    Myriad. The letter 'a' is very different.\r\n\r\ncheck it out.\r\n\r\n--\r\narjun"

  body: Myriad-looking with an obliqued roman as an italic sounds like Frutiger to
    me (Bak2 and 4). Bak3 is definitely Myriad.

  body: "\"I always thought that obliqued was the same as italics\"\r\n\r\nIn some
    fonts obliqued is sometimes called \"italics\", but in true italics the letters
    are not just slanted, they also have different shapes. Often the a, e, f and g
    (among others) are different in the italic than the slanted Roman letter would
    be.\r\n\r\nThe example attached is a serif font sample (Mikaway), but the same
    applies in Sans Serif fonts. It's true that more sans serif faces use and obliqued
    Roman as their \"italic\", but many do not.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mikaway_full_5022.gif]"
