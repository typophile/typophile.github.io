  logotype, so pretty sure its been amended, especially the lower case 'p'. However
  placing a name to the original font would be good.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "It looks to me like it might have been inspired (influenced) by <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-toms-roman/\">ITC
    Tom's Roman</a>, but if this is from the 70's then it was quite possibly hand-drawn.
    You could do a lot with film types to distort them, but not to re-draw their shapes.
    The reason I picked that typeface is that the 'y' and 'p' above the baseline are
    fairly similar,although the strokes in the logotype are heavier on the right side.
    Also it was designed in 1970, so it was around then.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    body: I definitely see your thinking about ITC Tom's Roman, it could well have
      been the starting point for the logo - Thanks, I'll give it a go.
