  with the following request. Does anyone out there know where to obtain this material?\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\"I
  would like order for a type mould which are used in hand\r\ncasting type, plus its
  matrices of 14pt, 18pt and 24point in Times\r\n Roman upright in alpha-numeric and
  their punctuation marks inclusive.\r\n At our workshop I have three platen letterpress,
  I find a lot of stand\r\n stills with scanty types. I kindly ask you to get us this
  kind of\r\n mould so that we can revive our letterpress machines.\r\n Kindly send
  us quotation plus shipping charges to Kampala,Uganda East\r\n Africa. \""

  body: "An Epilogue:\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Mulindwa reached me through the office of
    the Graphic Arts Collection, the National Museum of American History, the Smithsonian,
    where I once worked.  He was determined to acquire a type mould that would meet
    his very specific requirements: ie. he wished to cast type from his Linotype matrices.
    \ Their line caster no longer worked.  I suggested he import a Thompson type caster
    as this machine would serve his needs very well.  However, Arthur wished to keep
    his approach very basic, and after exchanging several e-mails I decided to accommodate
    his wishes.\r\n    I made him an 18 point mould that would allow Linotype matrices
    to fit beneath it without altering the mats, using a special holder to support
    the matrix, and to provide 'side walls', since Linotype matrices are made to fit
    tightly against neighboring letters.  An adjustment allowed Arthur to cast from
    'duplex' mats.  \r\n    While the mould was specially designed to cast from Linotype
    mats, in every other detail it was an authentic, mid-nineteenth century hand mould.\r\n
    \    Arthur Mulindwa expressed his satisfaction with the mould and within a month
    said they had cast a fount of 18 point type.\r\n     I'd like to add images but
    have not been successful in doing so. I made them quite small but this did not
    seem to help.  My computer skills are quite rudimentary.  Clicking on Insert image
    (below) I was directed to my files and selected the appropriate image, but received
    the message \"Could not copy image. Error\"  I assume it is a formatting problem,
    but at the smallest size the image still will not load. Oh well.\r\n"

  body: "Nice story! Great to satisfy such an esoteric request.\r\n\r\nInserting images:\r\nAssuming
    the format is correct (basic JPEG or GIF, haven't tried PNG myself) sometimes
    the filename will throw it off. For example an \"&\" in the filename won't work.
    So: keep the filenames short and simple. BTW if you want to avoid a horizontal
    scrollbar keep the width under 600 pixels.\r\n\r\nIf you still have trouble please
    feel free to email them to me* to fix up, then either post for you or send them
    back to you for posting.\r\n\r\n* hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \ Image labels had spaces. With these deleted the files loaded. Not sure how they

    closed, complete.\r\nSecond shot is mould without woods.  You can see how I created
    space for the matrix's ears.  Final shot, much reduced, of matrix holder."
