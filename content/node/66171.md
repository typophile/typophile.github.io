    the N is custom drawn. The rest is an uneven sans with what I call a type 2 R
    (where the straight leg comes from the bowl). The closest sans I could find was
    Unifonts Ziano. (see second sample)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nespresso_6682.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ZianoNespresso_4125.gif]"

    it is in big size.\r\nI read the 'stylised N represents a coffee bean'!"

  body: "Thanks Ben, that makes a different picture completely. The font I picked
    does actually have small serifs, so it's not too far off, even with the added
    detail, but now we might find a better match. I think it's probably a custom font,
    if it's not lettering, but Arrow might be close and there may be some tiny serif
    fonts worth looking at.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    It would need to be flattened, but it would be similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
