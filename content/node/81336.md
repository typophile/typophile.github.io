  body: "Hello. The top font is typical of the old letter-press hand set Arabic fonts
    of the early and mid 20th century. It is calligraphic and elegant and has a lot
    of ligatures but technically it was not perfect as you can see from the gaps between
    the connected letters and rather poorly matched letter endings. The second one
    appears to be a simplified typewriter font. \r\n\r\nThere are many modern computer
    fonts that can approximate either font - Windows' Simplified Arabic font for example
    is not too different from the typewriter font. Fonts.com has a Boutrous thuluth
    font that has a nice old-fashioned calligraphic look.  For more control on the
    appearance of  such old-style fonts you have to use  software such as Adobe's
    InDesign Middle East edition from Winsoft, and for even more sophisticated text
    handling of calligraphic Arabic you can get the Tasmeem plug-in for InDesign also
    from Winsoft but they are not cheap. There are many more such fonts and a few
    new systems for setting Arabic, but I cannot immediately recall their names.\r\n\r\nI
    am not sure what you mean by tughra font but I assume you mean calligraphic Arabic
    fonts."

  body: "If by \"tughra\" you mean: \u0637\u063A\u0631\u06CC then there is no font
    for this kind of calligraphy, \"tughra\" is just a writing style which calligraphers
    used for decorative purposes, and is way much complicated to make a font based
    on it.\r\nThere are some examples on this wiki page:\r\nhttp://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B7%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1"

  body: "thanks on your reply.Yes, I mean \u0637\u063A\u0631\u06CC or \u0637\u063A\u0631\u0627\u0621.
    But I think I found  on internet 3 tughra fonts, called 'H\xFCseyin D\xF6nmez'
    , 'Ibrahim guneh' & 'mehmed fatih candemir font'.hereis the link http://www.tugra-style.com/tugra/tr/galeri.html?start=3,
    but i have no idea where to download these fonts.\r\nIs there any site where  I
    can download arabic fonts like in images in my firt post?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I saw the link and it seems that the font you were referring is out there,
    but I don't know any reseller, and also this font contains glyphs which are digitalized
    design of actual calligraphy peaces, You can't write anything in \"tughra\" by
    that font.\r\nfor second question I suggest you myfonts.com and linotype.com,
    you can search \"arabic\" and troll through the results, I can't recognize your
    fonts but I guess for the first one \"lotus\" could be a replacement, and for
    second picture it seems that the font is printed by typewriter because it has
    a monospace kinda letters (if I'm wrong correct me), and if so it's pretty hard
    to find a close match (almost impossible), but you can use \"courier new\" which
    contains arabic glyphs by default in windows and also is monospace.\r\n\r\ncheers,
    Bahman"
