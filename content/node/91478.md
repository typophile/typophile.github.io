  body: Can't find a match. I assume, as many luxury brands, it c(sh)ould be custom
    job. For what it's worth, if you need to reproduce it, I would probably start
    with some very generic serif but sharing somehow the same design like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-roman-no-9/nimbus-roman-no9-t-bold-2842/|Nimbus
    Roman no9 Bold]] and tweak it (mainly transforming regular serifs into [[http://myfonts.us/td-cdb007|"latin]]
    style" ones, not so hard to do).
