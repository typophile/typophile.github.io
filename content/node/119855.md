  just went live with a simple tool to generate encoding text for FontLab.\r\n\r\nIt's
  still in a very early stage (I'm sorry if it's still too painful), but I want to
  share it with you guys in order to have feedback/suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the
  link: [[http://lab.scannerlicker.net/font-encoder/]]\r\n\r\nCheers!"
