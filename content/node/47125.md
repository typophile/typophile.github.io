body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_4383.png]\r\n\r\nI've had quite a
  time trying to ID this type.  Let's hope some of you have more luck.  I've used
  Identifont's type identifier several times, and have found *dozens* of fonts that
  are ALMOST a perfect match (Times New Roman Seven, Century Old Style, Old Style
  7, Varous Goudy types, some Garramond variants)... but each has a few glyphs that
  are different.\r\n\r\nTimes seven, for example, is missing the descending capital
  'J', and the italic lowercase 'v' and 'w' are pointed rather than curved.\r\n\r\nFFClifford
  Six is also very close, but the uppercase 'W' joins too high in the middle, the
  lowercase italic 'w' is slightly different, as is the lowercase italic 'f'... not
  to mention the fact that this type didn't exist in 1981.\r\n\r\nSome of the italic
  glyphs have been most difficult to match.  Note that the 'f' doesn't quite terminate
  in a ball at the bottom.  Also note the little loop at the beginning of the 'w'
  these seem to be rare characteristics that I haven't been able to find in any fonts
  that meet the other requirements.\r\n\r\nThe numbers may also be of help.\r\n\r\nHappy
  Hunting."

  body: This must be from the LDS version of the King James Bible. I remember those
    pages well. Never did ID the face. Might be something specific to the LDS publishing
    house.

  body: "David, I agree that looks like the answer. Where did you find that sample?
    The only place I found it was in Jaspert's \"Encyclopaedia...\", but the image
    was not as clear.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add the type to the Serif Font ID Guide if
    I can get a scan showing the whole Roman & italic faces. Please e-mail me.\r\n\r\n-
