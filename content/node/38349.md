  fonts ??_\r\nI've just finished with the design part of a Devanagari font and now
  I want to make it work. I really don't know anything about programming. I have more
  than 700 characters in it but only 110 have the Unicode assigned to them. How do
  I make others work_?\r\n\r\nPlease share if you have some links or VOLT tutorials.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSatya"
