  body: It's $125 at MyFonts, $125 at Emigre, and Jonathan Barnbrook doesn't sell
    it direct from his site. I think $125 is the best you're going to get, unless
    you are a student or are buying multiple licenses.

  body: That reminds me, Stephen, that I was going to buy Verdigris from FontShop
    a few days ago with the student discount, but I did not see it on the education
    page you linked to and assumed that the 10% discount no longer applies. I seem
    to recall this 10% offer once being on the education page; it would be great if
    it could appear there so that other students won't miss out on the cheaper price
    like I did (I ended up buying direct from MVB).

    it's not clear?"

  body: "I guess this is getting off topic, but the main site has the text, \"We offer
    special discounts to scholarly FontShoppers. Register using your .edu email address
    and we'll keep you up to date about specials.\" This suggested to me that as a
    student I am privy <em>only</em> to special promotions, not to a general discount.
    I now see that \"special discounts\" could mean \"a set of great low prices,\"
    but at the time I read it as \"only those fonts we let you know about are available
    at lower prices.\"\r\n\r\nDid the education site not once explicitly state the
    10% discount? Though I understand if you don't want to put out an unqualified
    discount like this."
