  like to keep them all at a similar scale, but some of the signatures will shoot
  a few hundred units far above or below a standard 1000-unit em quad. What is the
  best practice for configuring a font like this to work properly\u2014specifically
  with the MS Office apps?"

  body: "Make sure that the WinAscent and WinDescent values in the OS/2 table metrics
    exceed the height of the tallest glyphs in the font. This will prevent the extenders
    from being clipped.\r\n\r\nBy default, most apps on Windows will also use the
    WinAscent and WinDescent values to calculate default linespacing. You probably
    want to make the TypoAscender + TypoDescender + TypoLineGap (and corresponding
    hhea metrics) sum to the same number of units as WinAscent + WinDescent. This
    will give you the best all-round compatibility between different apps and platforms.
    The neatest way to do this is to make the TypoAscender + TypoDescender sum to
    the UPM value (treating all values as positive for the purpose of this calculation),
    and then set the TypoLineGap to equal the difference between the UPM value and
    the sum of the WinAscend + WinDescent."

  body: Is there some sort of practical limit to how big the Winascent, Windescent,
    HHEA Ascender and HHEA Descender can actually be? Mine are 1325 and -1290. The
    font appears to be fine, it works in TextEdit and Indesign, it validates as fine
    in Fontbook, but if I try using the font in Word it insists that the font is bad
    and disables it.
