body: Hello people, I have just begun a course called &#34;Digital Type&#34; where
  I study. I have begun to create a typeface originally designed around the form of
  the numeral &#34;2&#34;. This typeface has been created from scratch in three days,
  and I THINK it is going well, but I would deeply appreciate any critique you can
  give me. <BR> <BR>It was initially quite neoteric, a hard sans-serif. The spine
  &#40;?&#41; of the 2 reminded me of an art-nouveau style and I pursued that for
  a while. I became unsatisfied with its legibility and removed some elements of this
  &#34;art nouveau&#34; styling. I added some serifs and this is where I guess it
  is heading. It has all been very intuitive and based on a poor base-knowledge of
  typeface design. <BR> <BR>I intend to change the proportions of the O; next to the
  P it obviously doesn&#39;t work. I guess the art nouveau style will eventually completely
  dissapear in favour of legibility and unity. the perfect-circle O was inspired by
  art nouveau, but I have no particular reason to keep the style; it was just a stepping
  stone. <BR> <BR>Sorry for my post length. <BR> <BR>Shoot it to bits and i&#39;ll
  glue it back together in a better way.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/50399.jpg"

  body: 'Hi Christopher, <BR> <BR>this is not a bad start at all. <BR> <BR>Some first
    impressions and quick ideas: <BR> <BR>Where crossbars meet a stem &#40;and anywhere
    else where two &#34;pen strokes&#34; come together under a sharp angle&#41;, ink
    traps are often a good feature to add in order to make a too heavy or &#34;black&#34;
    portion of a character optically lighter &#40;if you don&#39;t know what an ink
    trap is, Google will easily find you an explanation&#41;. <BR> <BR>In your typeface,
    this mainly, but not exclusively, concerns the A and H. <BR> <BR>Compare, for
    instance, the A to the O. The A looks a tad heavier than the O, although stroke
    widths may be the same. This could be &#40;at least partially&#41; corrected by
    adding an ink trap in the appropriate place. <BR> <BR>Possibly the O Q D G bowls
    could use a tiny bit more weight. <BR> <BR>You surely are aware that, especially
    in typography, geometrical symmetry and measurements rarely equal optical symmetry
    and measurement and only the visual appearance of a character is of interest to
    the typographer. <BR> <BR>The bowls of you B, for instance, have the same dimensions,
    but the upper bowl appears to be both too high and long, disequilibrating the
    characters appearance. The B is top heavy and slightly tends to tip over to the
    right. <BR> <BR>The upper arm of your K seems to reach out a bit too far to the
    right. <BR> <BR>If you decide to retouch it anyway, you&#39;d be able to judge
    more easily if the K should really be wider than the R with which it shares the
    &#34;lower limbs&#34;. <BR> <BR>The horizontal symmetry in the D and C works uncommonly
    well in this typeface. <BR> <BR>The D&#39;s belly &#40;which seems to be an exact
    copy of the C O Q bowl&#41; looks almost a bit too pointy to me. <BR> <BR>About
    the same applies to the top/right heavy S. <BR> <BR>Besides that, the S lacks
    the typical features of the typeface and doesn&#39;t fit in very well. Look at
    your C and copy these spurs to the S. <BR> <BR>Round letters &#40;C G O Q S in
    your typeface&#41; tend to look too small when designed exactly as tall as the
    rest of the alphabet. The reason for this is, simply put, that a circle touches
    a tangent only in an infinitely small spot which has an effect on how tall we
    see a character. To compensate for this, the O, for instance, is often designed
    to reach over the lower and upper character grid line. <BR> <BR>The same is often
    true for pointed letters like A V W, where also few &#34;optical mass&#34; is
    near the lower or upper grid line. This does not apply to your typeface, though,
    since it features extended flat apices. <BR> <BR>I think the upper bar of the
    F and the T bar are a bit short. <BR> <BR>The Q tail shows a clearly more open
    and fluent and &#34;forward&#34; character than the nice sturdy legs of the R
    and K and I&#39;m not sure whether that fits well together. Maybe try something
    like the R/K leg as the Q tail. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think that the O and P look
    bad next to each other. <BR> <BR>If you decide to keep the Art Nouveau touch and
    the quite special E F H, you might want to try to copy the A crossbar to the B
    &#40;and R and even K and P&#41;. <BR> <BR>More could be said, but I leave that
    to others. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Keep working on that typeface. <BR> <BR>See you <BR>jpg <BR>
    <BR>PS: Maybe show us a small passage of text set in your typeface. I find it
    easier to judge a font in real use.'

  body: 'Ugh. These are wearying to read long lines of text &#40;a known issue in
    many forums&#41;. The line lenght corresponds with the dimension of the widest
    graphic in a thread. If you could post a graphic only 500 or 600 or so pixels
    wide the next time, the lines of surrounding text would be shorter and more comfortable
    to read. <BR> <BR>PS @ all: Temporarily blinding out graphics in your browser
    helps enormously! Of course it&#39;s not exactly the best of all imaginable solutions
    in a forum where text and graphic are so closely related. <BR> <BR>PPS @ Christopher:
    A type specimen is best viewed in PDF format.'

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;jpg, <BR> <BR>Thanks heaps
    for the critique! The S is a particularly problematic glyph for the inexperienced.
    I should have mentioned that I have not yet made optical adjustments; I am trying
    to establish the base structure of the typeface. The R, B, K, and P used to use
    the curve crossbar form in their arms, legs and er... other limbs. However, all
    the curves everywhere created a wierd wobbly visual pathway. It was just for legibilitiy
    reasons I removed them. <BR> <BR>That being said, I do believe it will become
    a display face as I have no time to produce a lower-case. Therefore, I think it
    is important n hindsight to retain those parts that give it it&#39;s character.
    <BR> <BR>Sorry about the image width, that really was clumsy of me. I have seen
    a really great shockwave viewer somebody used for their typeface, and will probably
    create something similar with zooming and panning features... I&#39;ll definitely
    explore PDF as well. <BR> <BR>Thanks twice for the help; I think I am the only
    student here really pursuing the creation of typefaces, and you probably know
    how tutors have little time out of class. <BR> <BR>Well, I have alot of work to
    do now! <BR> <BR>- Chris&#60;/font&#62;'
