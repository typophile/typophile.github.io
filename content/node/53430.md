  (ttf).\r\n\r\nIs there anything I need to change in the vfb to generate a proper
  ttf font.\r\n\r\nDo I need to change the direction of the paths or change the hinting
  ?"

    will do a lot of the work for you.\r\nYou will need to check the TT hinting, to
    see if FL has screwed anything up. Also check the gray scale settings and the
    additional blank glyphs required for TT flavor."

    I don't think that you need to do manual work. Of course, you can, if you want
    precise control over screen appearance, but it is not really necessary. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
