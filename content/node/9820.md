body: Bit of a problem at my job. <BR> <BR>We produce hangtags, warranty booklets
  and other related  <BR>printed materials for Samsonite. Multi-lingual texts including  <BR>Eastern
  European, Greek and Cyrillic are sent to us which  <BR>we have to lay-out on in
  QuarkXPress on Mac. <BR>These multi-lingual texts were input on PC using unicode  <BR>fonts,
  most probably Arial MS Unicode. <BR> <BR>So we have a multiple problem. <BR> <BR>First,
  we have no other option but to migrate to inDesign CS,  <BR>as QXP doesn&#39;t support
  Unicode until the bug-infested and  <BR>bankrupcy inducing version 7 is released
  in 2008 or so. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
  BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>Second, we need Helvetica &#40;as prescribed by the Samsonite  <BR>style
  manual&#41; in Rg, Ob, Bd and BdOb weights as a Unicode  <BR>font. I found a Linotype
  Pro version including everything I  <BR>need at MyFonts, but when I double-checked
  the fonts on the  <BR>Linotype site it looked as if in some instances Greek and
  in  <BR>other both Greek and Cyrillic were <i>not</i> included. <BR> <BR>Can anybody
  confirm that this version of Helvetica is indeed  <BR>a Unicode font including Easter
  European, Cyrillic and Greek,  <BR><i>not as separate add-on fonts.</i>

  body: MyFonts has a popup menu where you can select showings.  There should be a
    Cyrillic and a Greek choice in the menu.  I think they are limited in the number
    of characters they can show at once so that when you select &#34;all&#34; you
    get the typical western glyph set.

  body: 'Yves, you need <b>Helvetica Linotype</b>. This is a family of four OpenType
    fonts. The four weights available are just the ones you need &#40;the &#34;italics&#34;
    are only obliques&#41;. <BR> <BR>Each of the fonts has Western Latin and Extended
    European &#40;CE, Baltic, etc.&#41;, Greek, and Cyrillic characters, as well as
    Hebrew and Arabic. You can read the code page info in the description at the bottom
    of this page: <a href="http://www.linotype.com/48344/helveticalinotype-family.html"

    <BR> <BR>You can also purchase the fonts there, too ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Helvetica
    Linotype was released in 2002'

  body: I&#39;ll just note that the design of the Cyrillic and Greek letters in Helvetica
    Linotype differs very considerably from the earlier Helvetica Cyrillic and Greek
    designs &#40;the latter from the 1970s, not sure about the Cyrillic&#41;. When
    Linotype approach me about making a version of Helvetica for use as core fonts
    in software systems, I recommended redesigning the Cyrillic and Greek, and was
    very happy when Linotype okay&#39;d the budget for this. It should also be noted
    that Helvetica Linotype was completely respaced &#40;Latin too&#41;, because the
    older Helvetica fonts &#40;and the Helvetica Pro fonts that are based on them&#41;
    had inherited 18-unit spacing from earlier font formats, so had inconsistent sidebearings.
    This is important to note, because you won&#39;t get the same line-layout between
    the  Helvetica Pro fonts and the new Helvetica Linotype. So if you have existing
    documents set in the old Helvetica fonts and don&#39;t want them to reflow, you
    should avoid using the new font for that text. So, for instance, you might find
    that you end up using the Helvetica Pro fonts for Latin text and Helvetica Linotype
    only for the Cyrillic and Greek.

  body: Yves, I&#39;m not sure if any of the other Helvetica versions can solve your
    problems in four single fonts. <BR> <BR><i>&#40;The following is not an official
    statement&#41;</i> For instance, from what I can tell from the Linotype webshop,
    <a href="http://www.linotype.com/12753/neuehelvetica55roman-font.html" target="_blank">Neue
    Helvetica Pro</a> fonts have Western Latin and CE character sets in them, but
    not Greek or Cyrillic.  <BR> <BR>The OpenType fonts in the <a href="http://www.linotype.com/13446/helveticaroman-font.html"
    target="_blank">Helvetica</a> family on the other hand are different. <b>Std</b>
    seems to have Cyrillic characters in the character set, but no CE. The surperbly
    hinted <b>Com</b> version has Latin Extended characters, which include CE glyphs
    but not Cyrillic ones. <BR> <BR>If text flow issues would be a problem, and you
    don&#39;t think that Helvetica Linotype would be the best solution, I would recommend
    sending an e-mail to Linotype customer service, at <a href="mailto:info@linotype.com">info@linotype.com</a>.
    If you tell them exactly what your requirements are, they should be able to give
    you all of the definitive answers you would need. Additionally, you can call them
    up if e-mail isn&#39;t your thing. Info on that <a href="http://www.linotype.com/10-53-10/contactdetails.html"
    target="_blank">here</a>. <BR> <BR>I should add that, whenever anyone has questions
    about Linotype fonts, e-mailing the company support address &#40;<a href="mailto:info@linotype.com">info@linotype.com</a>&#41;
    is always the best way to get information. It is faster

    my question was &#34;misplaced&#34; &#40;to use too strong a word&#41;? <BR> <BR>One
    might indeed argue that I had better asked the question <BR>directly to tech support

    stuff for other people.  <BR>The only reason I asked here was because I deemed

    <BR> <BR>Dan, don&#39;t misunderstand me - I am not annoyed or anything. <IMG

    of misappropriating Typophile&#39;s resources, as we tend  <BR>to run into that
    quite often on the Type Identification Board.

  body: Yves, your question wasn&#39;t misplacesd at all. I just have to point out
    that for 100%-accurate info about any foundry&#39;s fonts, that foundry would
    be the best source. This isn&#39;t marketing spin; I am not a customer service
    rep, and I can make mistakes, too. <BR> <BR><i>The only reason I asked here was
    because I deemed the information as found on MyFonts and the Linotype website
    confusing.</i> <BR> <BR>This is why companies have customer service <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> . Plus, I don&#39;t think that Helvetica Linotype is for
    sale on MyFonts at the moment. <BR> <BR>I think that Typophile is the best source
    on the internet for opinion and information exchange about typography. This is
    a great place to ask &#34;what is the best font for this job&#34; or &#34;what
    are the roots of xxx typeface&#39;s design&#34; or even &#34;what is the future
    of OpenType application support?&#34; <BR> <BR>But the best place to find out
    whether or not a speciific character range is in a given commercial font is from
    the distributors themselves. This information is constantly changing. On a forum,
    you could get inaccurate advice, and then waste or lose time and money. And that
    would be sad. It would be great if every foundry would have their customer service
    reps surf typophile and other web forums around the clock to always dispense accurate
    information. Unfortuantely, this isn&#39;t the case at the moment, and a lot of
    info comes from individuals whose hearts are in the right place, but who may not
    be aware of certain little details in every case.

    actually made the font in question happens to be available, in which case you
    can probably get 110% accurate info, since the foundry seldom knows all the decisions
    that went into making the font, unless they made it internally. Even then, if
    the person who actually worked on the project leaves the company, typically some
    knowledge departs with him.
