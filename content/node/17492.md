  tried the Lubalin Graph, but it's so wide and not very legible and I have to use
  it for quit a large amount of text...\r\nIt's for a work about Avant Garde and Herb
  Lubalin..\r\n\r\nBy the way, I am now using the AG for the first time. While it
  was fun to set the word Avant Garde (with the ligatures of course), everything else
  isn't that funny with this font ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: In my opinion, Avant Garde works rather well with moderns. I've recently tried
    to solve the opposite problem of finding a strong sans serif headline font to
    match the Computer Modern of my thesis, and ultimately went with Avant Garde.
