body: "As a designer I\u2019m nowadays more and more involved with inkjet technology,
  for short-run digital book and journal printing. Having fine-tuned my (typographic)
  design choices with trial and error, I want to hear what other professionals in
  the field are thinking about this. I inspected type quality in terms of color, outline
  and overall readability, and most typefaces used in classic offset print don\u2019t
  give the same result in digital print. \r\nTypefaces are now revisited and optimized
  for web/screen, but are typefaces optimized for drop-on-demand print methods typically
  with a loss of fine details? Is there any research done on typography and these
  printing methods? If there are print experts and type designers interested to do
  this kind of research (in depth but on a small scale), feel free to contact me."
