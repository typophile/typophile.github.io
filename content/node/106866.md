  i've trawled font libraries and tried whatthefont but no matches or responses so
  far.\r\n\r\nWhatthefont suggested trying here so here I am...\r\n\r\nThe font is
  in use on www.wakestock.co.uk in the NEWS tab in the left hand navigation, the VIP
  PACKAGES tab in the right hand navigation and further down the right hand side for
  the FACEBOOK header.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a Gothic font but with hand draw/rough
  edges.\r\n\r\nHoping someone can help.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nKes"
