  body: I had an assignment like this last year. I had to classify and print all of
    my boss&#39;s fonts. A hell of a lot of fonts I might add &#40;oh and also all
    of the crummy freeware ones which he likes so much, hehe&#41;. <BR>Anyway, I found
    that the only program that would print uninstalled fonts without being too much
    of a hassle was Adobe Type Manager.  <BR> <BR>magnus
