  body: Yes, there is. Google "freetype" and you'll find more info. As the name implies,
    the software is free, but it has a lot of dependencies on other free programs
    so, unless, you're a programming guru or have a friend who is, it will take a
    lot of time and effort (or money) to get the package of free programs to do what
    Lettersetter will do.
