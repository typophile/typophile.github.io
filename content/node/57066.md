body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy name is Aron Kullander-\xD6stling, and I'm a swedish graphic
  design student. I study at Beckmans College of Design in Stockholm and I'm currently
  working on my thesis project that evolves around Open Source philosophy. How we
  could take it out of the software context and use it within different design processes.\r\n\r\nI
  am making a series of \"experiments\" \u2013 projects that each deals with different
  aspects of the philosophy. One of the projects is about collective development within
  type design. I have recently been looking into a homepage called FontStruct (www.fontstruct.com).
  FontStruct is a free online flash program where you can design fonts and download
  them as true type files. The homepage has the feature of sharing your fonts and
  even clone other \"fontstructions\" that is published on the site.\r\n\r\nFontStruct
  is constructed by a grid, where you use pixels or \"bricks\" with different patterns
  to build your fonts. This makes the program very limited, but with limitations comes
  creativity, right? One thing that the fonts created with FontStruct has in common
  is that they are very complex and decorative. It's almost 100% Headline fonts.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I am interested in is to try to push Fontstruct's limitations and try to make the
  \"best\" font possible due to readability. I am producing a catalogue about Open
  Source thinking whitin design. I want this catalogue to use this typeface for all
  the text. Since Fontstruct has the possibility to \"Clone\" typefaces it would be
  a good place to collectively try to develope a typeface. And since Fontstruct has
  an Open Source approach it would be a good platform to try out an experiment like
  this!\r\n\r\nSo, now I am asking if anybody would be interested in participating
  in this project? I have started to make sketches of different possible letterforms
  that I have published on the fontstruct homepage (http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/171664).
  Either you could continue to develope that as a starting point or create something
  from the start. It would be nice if we developed eachothers work and not just created
  something by ourselves...\r\n\r\nThe work you do doesn't have to be complete font
  sets. If you make some sketches, even if it's just a few letters, publish it on
  the site! It might give someone else an idea that can lead to further development,
  and in that way everyone doesn't have to work for weeks to get something done. The
  font including my sketches has the name \"Open Text\". Maybe we could all name our
  versions like that but add something to the end to keep track of the different versions.
  \r\n\r\nI hope that someone will find this interesting and give it a try! My catalogue
  will be printed in about three weeks, so it's a quick project (that off course could
  live on and continue to develope as long as people want to work with it). Unfortunately
  I wont be able to send the catalogue to everyone that is participating, but I will
  make it available as a downloadable PDF.\r\n\r\nVisit this link to clone the font
  and start working! (You will have to create an account on Fontstruct)\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014>
  http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/171664\r\n\r\nLooking forward
  to see some action!\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me:\r\naronkullander@gmail.com\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nAron Kullander-\xD6stling,\r\nBeckmans College of Design, Stockholm\r\n\r\n"

    FontStruct.\r\n\r\n<em>Fontstruct has the possibility to \"Clone\" typefaces (and
    I haven't really seen anyone using this feature)</em>\r\n\r\nActually, there are
    <a href=\"http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/gallery/all/shared/descending/1/any_category/any_license/with_options/clone\">plenty
    of examples of cloned FontStructions</a>. And as far as collective or group efforts,

  body: "Thanks for the answers.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote this text I had in mind to use
    it on different sites, and I can't really take for granted that people know about
    FontStruct. \r\n\r\nYou're right about the clone thing, sorry about that. It doesn't
    matter though, it's that the function exists that is good for this project. I've
    browsed through thousands of fonts on fontstruct and haven't really seen one that
    has the goal to be legible. Well, there is attempts but I think it could be developed
    a lot more. I find it interesting to use a program that is free for the public
    and very simple, and try to make the best out of the limitations due to functionality.
    Not only use it to make decorative fonts that works more like illustrative elements
    (Nothing wrong with that though...)."

  body: "So, for you who don't like to read long texts, here's a shorter version of
    the very long one at the top:\r\n\r\nI'm making a project about open source-thinking
    within graphic design. As a part of that project I want to develope a legible
    text face using FontStruct (www.fontstruct.com) and I want it to be developed
    collaboratively. To join the project, sign up at fontstruct.com and clone this
    typeface to have something to start with:\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014> http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/171664\r\n\r\nOr
    just make something new from the start. The common goal is to make a typeface
    as legible as possible. Name you typeface \"Open Text\" and add your name or whatever
    after so we can keep track of the typefaces. We can clone and work with eachothers
    sketches to collaboratively develope the text face. I will use this typeface for
    a catalogue i'm producing and the participants will be mentioned and the different
    sketches will be displayed in the catalogue. I will put it up as a PDF for download
    when it's done.\r\n\r\nHope someone would be interested! I just finished my first
    font that I made out of the sketches in \"Open Text\". I will publish it this
    week, so it will be possible to clone it and try to make it better.\r\n\r\nHope
    to see you at FontStruct!\r\n/\r\nAron\r\n\r\n\r\n<img>http://www.selectedworks.se/opentext/textsample.jpg</img>"
