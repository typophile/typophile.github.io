body: "This font would have had to exist since 1940 - \r\n\r\nSeveral unique things
  I noticed - the capital A is a 'loop' type capital - the lower case L has a lower
  starting point after the capital A and a higher starting point after the lower case
  O - I assume this would mean that lower case letters might have two slightly differing
  versions - also the lower case O is open at the top - \r\n\r\nConsidering the age,
  it's possible that this might not even be a fully developed font by today's standards

  body: "Thank you both for your response - I am like fonts, but have almost no 'font'
    knowledge -  \r\n\r\nI wondered that it might not be a font - I worded it poorly,
    but that was what I meant by my comment about not being a 'fully developed' font
    - \r\n\r\nIs it a fair statement that any given letter (eg, the lower case L in
    the sample) within a font type is always exactly the same? - I assume that would
    be a good clue that it was lettering as opposed to a font?\r\n\r\nAnd for a cursive
    font, would each letter have to begin and end (or perhaps exist) at exactly the
    same relative vertical position, so that the letters would 'connect' when displayed?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!"

  body: "@Larry\r\n\r\nIn the pre-digital days one could use handlettered glyphs in
    a reproduced form to make txts or headings. In the manner of draw once and use
    often (photocopying or other repro technique necessary). That implies that identical
    letters may occur in materials that were NOT typeset.\r\n\r\nThe typophile wizzes
    have a knack for seeing what is handmade and what ain\u2019t.\r\n\r\nThe fact
    that your sample consists of some identical letters and some glyphs with various
    executions (eg the \\l\\) supports my theory that this is lettering, done in the
    way I described."
