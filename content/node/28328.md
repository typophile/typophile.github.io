  i put it in 'Home \xBB forums \xBB Special Interest Groups \xBB Typographic Education'
  which makes me think it got missed by a lot of people.)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may all be
  well aware of this website, but just in case you weren't i thought i'd share this
  typographic (or should that be glyphic for non-printed letterforms?) goldmine of
  inspiration i found purely by chance...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/index.html\r\n\r\n(click
  on an image to see a much bigger version)\r\n\r\nIt seems a little picky to say,
  because the content speaks so well for itself, but it's a shame the website design
  doesn't really do the content justice. If i weren't so busy i might offer a pro
  bono make over :)\r\n\r\nHere's a small sample of the wonderous beauties that lay
  within...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AristotelesEthics600w_5236.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt
  makes me feel so talentless. Well, at least digitally fraudulent.\r\nAll hail the
  scribe.\r\n"
