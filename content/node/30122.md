body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've just updated an old logo for a project I'm in. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zap_logo_2_5568.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  aim of the project is to provide free wireless access in Qu\xE9bec city.\r\n\r\nThe
  look I'm aiming at is a mix between 40's illustration style and web 2.0, so something
  humanist with a modernist twist, or the other way around. Actually the less the
  modulation, the better I guess, but I still want some. ;)\r\n\r\nThe type in the
  logo is handmade, and I'm looking for a font to go with it.\r\nSo far there are
  my choices after a bit of research:\r\n\r\n\u2022 ITC Johnston --- Like it but unsure.\r\n\u2022
  URW Grotesk --- Dinka like this one too but I just dislike the \"a\" and I'm not
  sure it would read well.\r\n\u2022 FF Din --- It starts being a bit far from the
  logo but it would be interesting to use it.\r\n\r\nSo far my favourite is Johnston.
  \r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas, go for it."

    too.\r\n\r\nBy the way I'm not aiming as readability with the QU\xC9BEC line.
    But I guess it could use some extending without doing much damage."

  body: Johnston is a little more friendly than Grotesk, so I'd pick that one of the
    two. It also feels a little more municipal, it seems like something I'd see on
    buses or subway trains. FF Din is cool, but it don't get either 40s or Web 2.0
    out of it, so I don't think it fits with your design scheme.
