body: 'I&#39;m having an issue with a family of windows postscript fonts that I&#39;ve
  generated from Fontographer on the PC. When you go into ATM, only the regular and
  bold weights show up in the window.  <BR> <BR>When dragging and dropping the files
  onto the fonts folder, it says the .PFB is invalid or damaged for each font, but
  it still installs and I can use the fonts in any application. <BR> <BR>Question:
  What encoding option should I be choosing when I generate the fonts &#40;Windows
  95, Windows 3.1, Adobe Standard?&#41;. Would that make a difference? <BR> <BR>The
  fonts are named normally like Bold, BoldItalic, Black, BlackItalic etc. So I don&#39;t
  think it&#39;s a naming issue. <BR> <BR>Any help is appreciated.'

  body: Here is a screenshot of the font preview window. The postscript name is correct,
    but the name is showing up wrong. Weird. Alessandro, I&#39;ll try to rename them...

  body: 'It seems like you&#39;ve built the black weight as a style-linked bold to
    the regular. Windows can only have four-member font families, with only two weights
    plus italics in a single family. So for example, you might have the following
    Windows Family, Style &#40;PostScript FontName&#41; combos: <BR> <BR>Variable
    Light, Regular &#40;Variable-Light&#41; <BR>Variable, Regular &#40;Variable-Regular&#41;
    <BR>Variable Light, Bold &#40;Variable-Semibold&#41; <BR>Variable, Bold &#40;Variable-Bold&#41;
    <BR>Variable Black, Regular &#40;Variable-Black&#41; <BR> <BR>Also, although this
    couldn&#39;t cause the problem at hand, you ought to have a hyphen between the
    family name and the style in the PostScript FontName. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: No, the family name should precede the dash. <BR> <BR>Remember, the PostScript
    FontName is a completely separate issue from the Windows family name stuff. <BR>
    <BR>Family Name, Style &#40;PostScript FontName&#41; <BR> <BR>Variable Black,
    Regular &#40;Variable-Black&#41; <BR>Variable Black, Italic &#40;Variable-BlackOblique&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I should have pointed you at Adam&#39;s font naming thingie. It distills
    most everything he and I know about this stuff. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: The FOND name is a Mac-specific thing, so don&#39;t worry about that. <BR>
    <BR>As for the PostScript name, oh well. I suspect that it&#39;s Fontographer
    and not you. I guess there&#39;s nothing to be done about that part, then. It&#39;s
    not critical. <BR> <BR>Assuming for a moment that there isn&#39;t some hidden
    option, I&#39;ll go on to say that Fontographer never did make very good fonts.
    When you can afford it, you should move to a current-era font editor. FontLab,
    DTL FontMaster, maybe even TypeTool. <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'My two cents: I&#39;m using FL4.6 to generate several language versions of
    a typeface. The base names &#40;AfishaGrotesk&#41; are the same, then I put the
    language ID, say &#34;C&#34; for Cyrillic or &#34;E&#34; for CE. If I separate
    such suffix with a space &#40;AfishaGrotesk C&#41;, a weird error occurs: under
    MacOS X, Fontbook shows font sample with rearranged alphabet. If I eliminate the
    space in the name, everything is fine: the sample shows alphabet in the correct
    order. Seems like a definite bug either in FL, or in MacOS 10.3.4/Fontbook'

    a registered copy of Fontographer you can save quite a bit on FontLab? I think
    it&#39;s something to the tune of $150! Very nice of those guys at FL, I&#39;ll
