body: This is the first time posting on this forum. I just learned about it recently.  I
  am doing my senior sem project about advertising about a Beauty Supply store called
  Beautavia.  I am in typography class now but i still do not know how to handle typefaces.  i
  think i am better at designing then type.  Hopefully i will become good at both.  here
  is one of my magazine layouts on the bottom.  as you can see the text is plain.
  I got really creative with my image. I took colored hair extensions and scanned
  them all in and made them look like leaves.it looks like a flower.  Then i took
  a brush and scanned it in.  My teacher told me that my logo needs to be simple.
  I do not know if i should go with a serif, san serif, decorative font.  i have no
  clue.  Also with my Logo, do I use Beautavia Beauty Supply, or just Beautavia? Just
  make the fonts black or colored Do i make an image with my font, or just my font?  please
  give me all the critism and the help you can give me.  I have been working on this
  project for months and now the teachers decided to invite all the professors of
  the art department for a class critique, which is next wed.  please help, thanx<img

  body: 'Hi Ruia. <BR> <BR>This sounds like a fun project! Sometimes you have to work
    to see it that way, especially when you&#39;re up against a deadline. Here are
    some thoughts for you. <BR> <BR><i>do I use Beautavia Beauty Supply, or just Beautavia?</i>
    <BR>1&#41; Outside of school you will fight the uphill battle against logos that
    read Beautavia Beauty Supply and Specialty Cosmeticological Products International
    Companies, LTD. Use Beautavia.  <BR> <BR><i>I got really creative with my image.</i>
    <BR>2&#41; Yes you did! This is really a layout suggestion. The focal point of
    the piece is the hair extention/flower, less on the brush. I&#39;d do one of two
    things:  <BR>a. Crop the image differently, and bring the flower down. Give it
    some space at the top &#40;maybe even put the &#34;hint of color brilliance&#34;
    up in the new found space&#41;. <BR>b. Do a horizontal layout, or a two page spread
    if you have the option. Show many <i>flowers</i> at smaller sizes and focus on
    your color pallet. <BR>In either case, I&#39;d choose a background color that
    competes with the image less. You&#39;re cyan is overpowering the hint. <BR> <BR><i>

  body: Thanx so much Randy. I need to print all this info out so I can take it step
    by steo.  With my logo I think I want to keep it short for BBS.  Instead of Beatavia
    Beauty Supply.  My classmates want me to make a logo with a blowdryer, scissors.
    etc  I want mine to stand out and be different.  Thanx for all the motivation
    you have giving me, any more thoughts lt me know

  body: 'Take the opportunity to base the logo just on Beautavia, adding blowdryers
    &amp;c will only detract, if you want to add an image think about more of a natural
    image jojoba seed/flower. When designing a logo you should consider using it white
    out &#40;as you have it&#41;, black, 1 colour &#40;Pantone or similar&#41;, 4
    colour version of it for different printing applications. Randy offered some very
    good advice on the b/g colour and fonts - the idiom is to use a fine typeface.
    <BR>However, since you do not have a client weighing in with comments like &#34;this
    isn&#39;t like so-and-so cosmetic company&#34;, don&#39;t feel you have to submit
    to the tyranny of following other designs. The image is great - give it some space
    to breathe, and prepare a presentation for your tutors '

  body: alright you guys this is the scoop on my senior sem project.  I didnt have
    alot of time to add everything but i changed some stuff that you guys commented
    on.  basically the teacher critisized to the extreme, which was a good thing because
    all the art department faculty was not there and next wed they will be meeting
    us.these were the 2 layouts i showed.  i lowered the flower and changed the backround.  For
    the first one she asked me why the colors of the flower were so bold and I told
    her because the age group i am dealing with is 16 to 30 age group and they are
    more modern and they go for funky colors.  I chose the allise font which was tall
    and skinny and she loved it.  She didnt like the placement and she busted me out
    on my quote.  A hint of color brillance.  she said if my girls are from 16 to
    30 and they like bold colors, wouldnt they be screaming of color.  i felt really
    embaressed but hey at least she made a point.  some of my class mates told me
    to get rid of my whole flower campaign and start from scratch.  so I did another
    layout and they liked it but the only thing they said was the world looked too
    much like a golf ball.  I still didnt come up with a logo.  I just chose a simple
    one and she told me I needed to have a nice logo.  im sorry this email was so
    long, but wanted to share with you what was going on. thanx <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/18223.jpg"

  body: 'thanx for all your suggestions.  im going to keep on working it.  I decided
    to design the logo for Beautavia, simple.  take a look at it and comments are
    well appreciated, thanx.  there are three examples and i just drew the hair on
    the sides and placed it by the B.  I tried placed it on the a but it didnt look
    nice.  I also kerned but im also learning how to do that as well, so let me know
    what you think.<!--attachment: beautone-18282.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*176.9*beauty*beautone%2eai

  body: I prefer the 3rd logo, although I don&#39;t feel it is clear what the hair
    is and the weight of the line is too heavy. As for the kerning the &#39;av&#39;
    is too far apart - a good method for kerning is to print out your file hold it
    upside down and view it with half closed eyes any large or small spaces become
    more obvious. On the layout, the grey background is too dominating &#40;although
    it is difficult with small jpegs to really appreciate it&#41; a subtler shade
    or white would improve the image as hero, also I would reduce the size of the
    logo, smaller than the headline, and keep it clear of the image you could produce
    two layouts demonstrating how the ad would work on a recto or verso page. The
    second layout kind of shows why design by committee should be avoided, your original
    concept was strong - stick with and improve that. Good luck. <BR>Tim
