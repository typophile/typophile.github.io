body: "(note: this was in the general section until someone suggested it be moved
  to crit. Since it's not type design, I moved to the design category)\r\n\r\nEllo!\r\n\r\nI
  am working on a project for a design class and it entails a little research.\r\n\r\nCheck
  out http://evanmade.com/hopefear\r\n\r\nIn order to try to get people to actually
  read the little lead in, I tried to use some interesting typography. This was done
  fairly quickly, so things like grid and measure were not used (tisk tisk, i know).\r\n\r\nI
  would still like a little feedback on the design and I would love to have some of
  you participate with either words, or images/artwork (or both).\r\n\r\nSo please
  check out the project - http://evanmade.com/hopefear\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\nEvan

    add confusion. I would suggest messaging a moderator (in case they don't spot
    this here anyway) to move it to the correct board. \r\nBTW there is a \"typography\"
    section in the Critique boards, which is exactly for these kinds of things. \r\n\r\n*

  body: "I like it. The way you alternate contrasting fonts, sizes, and shapes creates
    a nice rhythm that puts the emphasis in the right places.\r\n\r\nAnything with
    so much variety needs a unifying motif to hold it all together, and you've got
    one: Everything is <em>very</em> symmetrical. So when you click through to the
    questionnaire pages, the small instruction paragraphs (\"You give permission .
    . .\" etc.) look wrong because they're aligned on the left. I suggest you center
    each line of those paragraphs."
