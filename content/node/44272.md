body: "I'm trying to make use of FontLab's ability to run a Python script when a font
  is opened, the open.py that's located in the \"System\" Macros folder but I'm unable
  to get things working.\r\n\r\nAs a test, in the \"System\" Macros folder I have
  an open.py that contains:\r\n<code>print 'font opened'</code>\r\n\r\n...and a save.py
  that contains\r\n<code>print 'font saved'</code>\r\n\r\n...but only the save.py
  is working. I've tried opening fonts from the file menu and by double clicking a
  VFB but I get nothing. Is there something else I need to do? I've tried this on
  two computers, with both FontLab 5.0.2 and 5.0.4 for the Mac.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nAndy"

  body: "Hm, since it's been a day I'm gonna follow up my own question with something
    a bit more broad:\r\n\r\nDoes anyone use the open.py script in the \"System\"
    Macros folder? \r\n\r\nCan anyone confirm that it's supposed to work with FontLab
    5?\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand, FontLab should execute this script when the
    application is launched, so if anyone wants to test the open.py and save.py you
    can just put a simple print statement in them like I mentioned in the last post
    and see if anything happens (only the save.py works for me)\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,\r\nAndy"
