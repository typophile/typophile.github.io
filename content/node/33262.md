body: "I'm working up a post on this issue I've found in my design process as well
  as in some other (Apple-supplied) fonts on my computer to send to Apple's bug reporter,
  but figured I'd get some comments from the build community on what other causes/symptoms/solutions
  might be.\r\n\r\nIf you take a font like Lucide Grande, comparing the double-acute
  and the double-grave at a low font size, the double-grave almost disappears, whilst
  the double-acute is very visible.  I've run into it randomly on some of my fonts,
  but I finally figured out the cause (but not the reason for the symptom):\r\n\r\nWhen
  doing anything with combining accents, it's extremely important that the directions
  are the same for both the diacritic and the baseform.  Otherwise, OS X has some
  odd rendering issues.  I made a simple font to illustrate this.  In the attached
  PDF and font, the character A as a long thick line with a square dot over it, and
  B being the exact same, except with the dot made counter-clockwise instead of clockwise.
  \r\n\r\n[note: half finished with this write up and accidentally posted, bout to
  run to work but will finish it shortly]."

  body: This isn't very surprising, path direction in TT fonts must be clockwise (black
    on the right) and path direction in PS fonts must be widdershins  (black on left).
    While renderers do not necessarily have a problem with contrary path directions,
    some clearly do and the usual result is invisible or outline shapes.

  body: "Mainly when I run into this (and, I believe, though I've not opened up Lucida's
    file to double check), it appears to be related to applying transformations to
    referenced glyphs.  If the transformation is a flip, should the path direction
    be flipped as well, or should it be maintained?  While it makes sense for the
    latter since a mirror image should go in the other direction, for font designing
    purposes, it makes more sense to have the direction corrected during transformation.\r\n\r\nFor
    now I guess I'll just dereference the glyphs after transformations, but I was
    wondering to what extent I should consider this a \"me\" problem, a FontForge
    problem or a Quartz problem.  \r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que

  body: 'Thanks for sharing this Matthew. The only thing I would add to John''s comments
    is that sometimes the tt info you supply with the font can also make the rendering
    change in OSX. Especially the Cap & X height. Sometimes it''s subtle but if you
    are looking for super crisp looking in a variety of sizes you will often have
    to tweak around until you find something that is acceptable. '

  body: "I'll have to work with that setting as well.  Another oddity I've found is
    if there's an open path (e.g., no shape, just a [poly]line) that crosses over
    a shape whether clockwise or anticlockwise, it will produce an artifact in the
    rendering.  I've found the more information you can provide for Apple upon a bug
    (especially in the \"here's a case of it causing a problem with files that Apple
    ships), the more likely it'll get fixed down the road.  I'm sure that's the case
    with most things, but heh.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina

  body: "\"For now I guess I\u2019ll just dereference the glyphs after transformations\"\r\n\r\nThat's
    the best solution. Composites, we think, are safely limited to reference of glyphs
    and x-y positioning. The only thing that makes it a \"you\" problem, is that you
    think something simple like this (using composites in an unfettered way), should
    \"just work\" the way things do in graphics programs. Unfortunately composites
    were improperly implemented in TT so there is no progress here and none is likely,
    Ever."
