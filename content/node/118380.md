body: "Dear friends,\r\n\r\nWhat, if any, digitization of this late-19th Century Didot
  has the same sort of winged or eared--pardon my terminology ignorance--lowercase
  v? Linotype and Hoefler don't match (the former has a sharp, chiseled lowercase
  v, while the latter has a different sort of lowercase g). Optimo's Didot, while
  lovely, also doesn't quite match. Note that the attached images is of a proof, circa
  1898, from Imprimerie Didot.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJeff[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mall_6179.jpg]"

  body: Thanks, kthomps5. I feel like the DietDidot bold italic might work--but I'm
    worried those very thin strokes are going to be as faint as the Linotype Didot
    in offset printing.

  body: My thought, too. Sadly, no one seems to have done a faithful digitization
    of your sample font.

    a whirl.

  body: 'An update: I just bought Diet Didot bold and bold italic, and the thin strokes
    are far too fine (perhaps even a hair finer than the Frutiger Didot) for safe
    use in an offset book. I''ll keep researching . . .'
