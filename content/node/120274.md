    but with a little editing the following font may work:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/volcano/trigot/"

  body: "Found a match in Phil Martin's AI Celebration (1969) - a photolettering font.
    Now to find a decent image of it ...\r\n\r\nDigitally, the only font I'm aware
    of is Opti Wycombe. But, George, Opti \"borrowed\" lots of other foundries fonts
    and gave them new names. They've been out of business for years. We always caution
    against using an Opti font commercially."

  body: "Usual caveat about orphan fonts from OPTI but I agree OPTI Wycombe seems
    to have the letters of Clelebration.\r\nOPTI did some original digitizations and
    in the absence of another digital version of Celebration, I suspect this is one
    of them. But there is no legitimate way to acquire or use an OPTI font.\r\nKevin's
    suggestion of Liberation could work for making a reasonable facsimile.\r\nDon "
