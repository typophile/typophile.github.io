body: "Hi, I was hoping to get some help with some bizarre problems. \r\n\r\n#1- \"w\"
  doesn't appear until struck twice in illustrator. But only when it is the first
  letter in the text box. \r\n\r\n#2- The lower counter on the ampersand appears filled
  when illustrator is zoomed in. This appears to be related to the character's optical
  size on screen, not the specific zoom level. \r\n\r\n#3- a few characters display
  little hairlines at small sizes. \r\n\r\nI'm frankly stumped. Has anyone seen any
  of these before?"

    Also, the /w problem fixed itself for some unknown reason.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could
    shed light on that /w problem, I'd love to know more.  "
