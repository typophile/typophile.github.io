    body: "Thanks for the fast response! Proxima Nova Semibold Extra Condensed is
      very, very close but not exactly the same. The font used for JIM'N NICK'S has
      consistent line width while Proxima Nova Semibold Extra Condensed is slightly
      variable.  The R crossbar is also lower on the glyph, just a tad higher than
      the A crossbar. The Q is also a bit more square in the logo. I have to say,
      this is quite a bit closer than what I have found so far though. any more guesses
      are welcomed for sure!\r\n\r\nLearning Curve is spot on!\r\n\r\nI think the
      third font (smaller text) belongs to the URW Signal family\r\n"

    going to check out Google fonts\u2014I've a sneaking suspicion it might be one
    of them...."

    but not a match to anything else. And I had no luck with Google fonts. \r\n\r\nSignal
    seems to be your best bet for all the sans-serif type, with just a customization
    on the tail of the Q."

      close as it gets.
