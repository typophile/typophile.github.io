  Designer and Photographer, Leandro Lattes, who took pictures of all these kind of
  Things in Madrid, the city where I live and where I was born. <BR>It,s TRUE and
  it is SHAME, these all things are dissapearing, regular every-day stores and shops
  &#40;and a lot of things, you know...&#41; are starting to look alike all over the
  world. Maybe it is the price we have to pay. I know we must change things, is in
  ourselves, but ... <BR> <BR>PS: Specially for you Jesus <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/13429.gif"

    love to return. <BR> <BR>I miss the &#0147;bocadillo de calamares&#0148; from

  body: Hey Ignacio, this is a funny coincidence, because Leandro is a very good  <BR>friend
    of mine. We used to work together a few years ago... <BR> <BR>He has <a href="a%20http://www.domingoporlatarde.com/"

    <BR>Thanks for the post, it brings back good memories.
