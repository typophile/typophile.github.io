  that there wouldn't bee much room for \"artistic interpretation\" but thats merely
  an assumption. I'm wondering if different cultures tend to treat certain relationships
  of line and weight the same way we do. If anyone knows anything about kanji, or
  any other alphabet for that matter, mind pointing me to some examples of typography?\r\n\r\nthanks "

    puzzled why one would think otherwise. We are talking about a writing system with
    a rich history of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_script_styles|script
    styles]].\r\n\r\nAs for the relationships of line and weight, that depends on
    specific styles, just as the treatment is different for the Latin alphabet depending
    on whether the style is inscriptional, old-style, or modern.\r\n\r\nSome earlier
    threads you may want to look at:\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/42433]]\r\n[[http://www.typophile.com/node/30875]]\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/72172]]"

    lend itself to the abstraction of its shapes. Take Bifur for example.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.prepressure.com/images/fonts_sample_bifur.png\r\n\r\nOr
    something like this...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.meandmypen.com/work.php?id=224\r\n\r\n
    Are there typefaces/examples of typography comparable to that in other writing
    systems? It seems like it wouldn't take a whole lot of mucking with for the characters
    to lose all meaning. I wouldn't be surprised if there was, but I haven't been
    able to come upon any.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There are much more decorative examples in other writing systems!\r\nArabic,
    for one. \r\nBut, remaining in the Kanji/Hanzi field, some examples would be a
    series of prints by Hokusai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai) in which famous
    poets where drawn using the characters of their name, or this chinese book (http://www.frelax.com/cgilocal/enitem.cgi?db=book&ty=id&id=YJWZ062195)
    which presents figurative ways to write chinese characters.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "On this point of complexity, Chinese characters have a lot of built-in redundancy.
    Most characters are built from combinations of components called radicals, so
    there's plenty of leeway for stylistic variation. It allows characters to be readable
    even when they seem to be too small, blurry, or stylized to pick out individual
    strokes.\r\n"
