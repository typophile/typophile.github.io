    <BR> <BR>Yeah right. Another domino block has tumbled. <BR> <BR>How long before
    Newspeak is the official world language? <BR>I&#39;m giving Dutch give or take
    half a century before it goes  <BR>the way of the dodo. Oh well we could be wrong...

  body: Yeh, but your doing yourselves no favours in The Netherlands. No one wants
    to speak Dutch...  <BR> <BR>I go to a store and try and shop in Dutch and the
    person working detects my accent and switches to English. Whilst if I do the same
    in Paris, they speak french even faster to try and be as hard to understand as
    possible. <BR> <BR>Or maybe Dutch people are just nice... <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>===

    beat this combination!
