  body: "I'm not keen on G\xFCnter's version of Garamond, it is neither 'fish nor
    flesh', it lacks some of the 'quirks' that makes garamond such an interesting
    face, but doesn't manage to consistently fix them either...\r\n\r\njust my two

  body: I have always found the squared off serifs to be kind of interesting - give
    it a more crisp look.

  body: But how does it compare to, say, other Garamond revivals such as Adobe Garamond/Premier
    Pro, Sabon Next, or other more contemporary workhorse types such as Verdigris?

  body: Garamond Premier Pro is, IMHO, the ultimate Garamond available today. No other
    Garamond revival has optical sizing with as much attention to historic detail
    as does this by Robert Slimbach. You will be better served by switching.
