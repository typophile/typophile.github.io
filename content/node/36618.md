body: "Hello.\r\nI've searched this forum for answers to my questions, but I haven't
  found any yet. So, here is my problem:\r\n\r\nI have buiit a whole font and now
  I have realised that the 60%-figures (as \"onesuperior\" etc.) could be a bit bolder.
  When I try to do this via tools/action/effects/outline (H weight: 2, V weight: 2,
  \"keep glyph dimensions\" enabled) , a strange thing occurs: the glyph shifts some
  units to the left and to the bottom. The problems seems to be in the \"V weight\",
  because if I leave this V to 0, the change to the H weight functions. \r\n\r\nI
  have tried to change the contour's direction, but it didn't solve the problem.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anybody has an idea? Thanks a lot. Mathilde"
