  way past its prime. \r\n\r\nThis temporary Typophile theme you're seeing now puts
  us back at our roots, in a way. Since 2000, Typophile has been a vibrant community
  focused around these very forums. It's a community built around a love for the craft
  of typography and design, and these forums have been home to hundreds of thousands
  of conversations around type. \r\n\r\nDon't worry, this is not the new permanent
  look for Typophile. It's merely a temporary state while we tighten up a new look
  for Typophile. Removing the Flash is the first big necessary step toward correcting
  a number of other bugs (file upload, anyone?) that have been plaguing us. Rather
  than take the site down while we get things squared away, we opted to keep it up
  so you can talk type while we're heads-down on the new Typophile.\r\n\r\nYes, we
  know the theme is not perfect. Go easy, make constructive suggestions and we'll
  make CSS tweaks as we go.\r\n\r\nMost of all, get involved! \r\n\r\n"

  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    and the last few years the number of bugs have grown steadily while Punchcut have
    seemingly \"forgot\" all about running and maintaining the site.  The lack of
    moderating coupled with the recent type hype have resulted in a lot of spam, a
    lot of\"do my homework\" traffic and a lot of derailed conversations.  Many of
    the true professionals have left Typophile, which is apparent in the critique
    forum where amateurs voice their opinion loudy, no-one sets them straight and
    newcomers follow blindly.  As a result, Typeboard -- the small seed of what may
    become a new and better forum (?) -- was launched just a few days ago. \r\n\r\nAnd
    now this new initative from Typophile. Should we understand this as a response
    to the competition? Have the financial situation suddenly changed? Who will be
    in charge? Do you have a serious plan now? "

    of typographic discussion has moved to twitter. The other is that because there
    are now circles associated with Reading and KABK, and it seems like they are interacting
    in other ways. KABK are taking up a lot of ''new blood'' who would have enlivened
    typophile, but they are now using twitter a lot. How to be welcoming to new designers,
    and how to relate to twitter are things worth thinking about, to keep Typophile
    vital. I love Typophile. It has its ups and downs, but I think the changed educational
    situation and social media situation is worth thinking about.   '

    the migration to Twitter, Facebook, etc.?  Yes, there are now other options but
    they each have their drawbacks. Competition works when the competitors offer a
    better solution.  Twitter is not a better solution, it is a different path. Twitter
    works best when you already know the others you interact with so it is more closed
    circle.  Typophile used to be an open circle with fuzzy borders that was somehow
    inviting.  Something may have happened to put the "don't bother" signs up at all
    perimeter points?

    is the content.  Sure, there was always some \"what is your favorite\" and \"do
    my homework for me\" threads, but today, it is rare to see a thread with content
    that you actually wanted to read.  I am not talking about the reality TV pis\xDFing
    matches that were too plentiful for me.  I am talking about real discussions that
    used to happen.  There was plenty of good material in \"Build\" but now it looks
    more like \"foreclosure\" than build.\r\nIt seems as though everyone in the industry
    from the most renowned type designer or executive to the young, beaming-with-
    zeal, ernest neophyte was posting here.  Now, it seems as though many of these
    people have either been annoyed enough to leave or got just plain fed up with
    the nothingness and just moved on.\r\nI also have concerns about hints of possible
    censorship but will not go into detail here because it would be unfair to all
    parties.\r\nYes, the spam protection is sorely lacking, the upload of files is
    maddening, the Flash screw-ups are annoying, but.  The main thing is that content
    and meaningful dialogue have diminished markedly.  Is this a case of Typophile
    just running its course and achieving entropy or is it something that can be fixed?
    \ I don't know.  There was a good run there for several years. Was that just by
    chance or were we all doing something different then?\r\nNowadays, the hosts don't

    and I find myself less interested or willing to spend the time I once did in earnest

    in the build thread all along, but authors of new software seem to prefer their

    because of the pointless rudeness that happens pretty regularly. \r\n\r\nOther
    social media are definitely competition. I think that in principle Typophile has
    an edge on these, but I think the new edition needs to respond to the competition.
    Should there be an optional  link or tie in to twitter posts? \r\n\r\nI think
    addressing the rudeness issue would help a lot. An 'abusive comment' button, with

    also many not so gifted and rude, who are at least as numerous.  My point is that
    if you allow rudeness on a forum, then you are going to keep people away. Even
    if the person is gifted, the rudeness is too damaging to a forum to permit, in
    my opinion. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I don't think the solution is a matter of excluding
    people, except in the rarest instance. If you set up a structure that encourages
    respect and deletes personal attacks you will get people who might be rude holding
    back. There is something about forums on the internet that seems to bring out
    'flaming' from people unless. And those people might be much more courteous in
    person. So something needs to be done to encourage a culture of respect and courtesy.
    \r\n\r\nThis does not mean no criticism of work. People can be tough critics of
    work without getting personal. It is attacking the person, not the work, that
    should be banished. \r\n\r\nOne possibility is to have an 'abuse' button at the
    side of the page, with the ads etc., and with a statement of 'no personal attacks'
    policy. The idea would be that you could drag the button on top of a post to flag
    it, and that would alert the admins. I don't know how hard that would be to program,
    but it would mean that you clearly warn people, and have a mechanism. I don't
    think it would have to be used so much after a while. And people might be more
    courteous.   \r\n\r\nThere may be better ways, and I'd be interested in hearing
    the experience of others on other forums, and how this is handled. "

      you to read 1 post at a time from top to bottom, can be incredibly disorienting
      and cumbersome. For the purposes of this forum, I believe the convention of
      bottom posting will stick. Top-posting tends to work better for personal correspondence,
      such as email, where there is only two people talking, and you know what you
      have already said. Or twitter/facebook where it\u2019s mostly a feed of unrelated
      clips.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion, that in the context of meaning dialogue in a
      forum, between many people, being able to read it from top to bottom, start
      to finish, to develop a logical sense of the flow of ideas and direction of
      conversation, bottom posting is almost essential. \r\n\r\nThis has been hotly
      contested here before, but I cannot find the thread.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style\r\n\r\nWhat
      would be a huge, and split the difference at the same time, would be to place
      the \u201C1  2  3 next\u203A  last \xBB\u201D at the top of the 1st page instead
      of the bottom.\r\n\r\n<strong>And for the love of god, please, turn the text
      black, temp mode or not</strong>. Writing this has given me a headache. I can\u2019t
      even see the damn edit button anymore.\r\n"

    which I have little respect - people come first, not mannerism.\r\nI've been using
    computers since 1977, and it's the one thing I've\r\nlearned. I recently started

    for us all.\r\n\r\n* And I certainly don't mean for some HTML-\r\nstandards berserker,
    I mean for real people.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to simply give up and not worry.
    When I see\r\nyour (plural) posts, where the longer paragraphs become\r\nintimidating
    in terms of readability, I physically don't want\r\nto read them, and I write
    to be read, not to vent. Is it a shock\r\nthat all your long paragraphs read like
    crap? What good piece\r\nof typesetting has lines that are like spaghetti? We
    complain\r\nabout letter-size paper being about an inch too wide for good\r\ntypesetting
    and waste a good 1/4 of the area, post-rationalizing\r\nthat whitespace is just
    as important as content, but we're entirely\r\nhappy with simply caving in online?\r\n\r\nJan,

    please, and caring is my blood. Why do you think\r\nI go to the trouble? It's
    really a lot of extra work, and I don't\r\nbelieve in waste.\r\n\r\nAbout my \"signature\":
    it takes 3 seconds, it might sometimes\r\nhelp searchability, and it adds an extra
    layer of information, saving\r\npeople from having to flick their gaze to the
    top-left (I often have\r\nto divert my gaze to see who wrote the post). I've been
    using \"hhp\"\r\nsince 1998 (tellingly lowercased, even though I don't believe
    in\r\nmoron-grammar) so think of it as a personal tradition, a slight\r\ntouch
    of color in a sea of pure text, not an instance of vanity.\r\n\r\nThis is not

    elements of the new temp template. That\u2019s how y\u2019all wound up with this
    current incarnation.\r\n\r\nI believe that restoring the 580 width was one of
    the things I had done; I think it was originally even wider (but I could be misremembering).\r\n\r\nThe
    html structure and css for Typophile is a bit of a mess, from what I\u2019ve looked
    into. There are plenty of things that could/should be done better to be more flexible
    both for desktop and mobile devices. Lots of folks have made good suggestions.
    I imagine that some of this would involve revising the underlying page templates
    and html. There's only so much that can be adapted through the CSS alone. \r\n\r\nI
    made no attempt to clean up the existing CSS nor to create robust additions. I
    was doing it mostly for myself; and I just happened to have addressed many of
    the things people were initially discussing. So I offered my Stylish overrides
    to Jared to tack on the end of the Typophile CSS as a quick fix (\u2014 mostly
    because I was tired of all the whinging).\r\n\r\nBut I have no interest in spending
    more time to chase down everyone\u2019s whims and complaints. So the ball is back
    in Punchcut\u2019s court.\r\n"

  body: "Hrant: Honestly, your posts are no problem on the computer I'm using right
    now. It's only a couple years old and has a decent (by current standards) resolution.
    Actually, it's nice because (as you argue) the width of the lines are more natural
    to read. On my Mac, however, which has a lower resolution of 1024 x 768, Typophile's
    new layout often makes your blocks of text break, and it's much harder to read.\r\n\r\nHonestly
    I think the problem is twofold:\r\n1. Typophile <em>should</em> be setting their
    text column thinner, and it really can't be measured in %, as they are doing now,
    since it make the column width wider or shorter depending on the device/resolution.
    Although it would require redoing a lot of the CSS, measuring in EM would ensure
    the lines are always optimal length.\r\n2. You (Hrant) really should stop inserting
    hard line breaks. Especially if/when Typophile fixes the column width issue, because
    it would not break on lower resolutions (my Mac isn't a handheld\u2014I use it
    for work), and also the line-length would be handled by Typophile and be consistent
    with the formatting of the other posts."

  body: Since the beginning of word processing, I have always been driven mad by the
    use of hard returns.  In those days, people were used to the typewriter where
    a carriage return, multiple tabs or spaces all had the same effect.  It was printed
    on paper and then re-typed by a type house so what the customer did formatting
    meant little.  Along comes the transition to electronically captured word processing
    being sent via tape or disk to the type house which then was bound to absorb the
    tedious labor of taking away all the problematic typing done by his clients.  Now
    comes the all-in-one process where the page layout person and type house are the
    same individual.  Even much worse, today comes the multiple device viewing of
    a single digital flow of text.  Bunches of browsers, bunches of hand-held devices,
    bunches of resolutions, bunches of default typefaces, different platforms and
    versions of the software, some subpixel rendering and some not, some greyscale
    and some not. The odds of what the enduser sees on his device looking exactly
    like it did on the original authors source device is quite slim.  The only prayer
    of workable shifts in devices is if everyone strictly avoids hard returns or multiple
    tabs or spaces to push a line break that only looks good on their screen.  The
    end user at least knows where a paragraph ends.  This is one heck of a lot better
    than trying to mind read the original author or guess what system they used to
    write the darn thing.  What you may think you are fixing for 2% of your readers,
    you are totally fuchking up for 98% of your readers.

  body: "> your suggestion is labor-intensive at this point\r\n\r\nActually I'm not
    sure that it would be. Does anyone know how many new accounts are set up per day?
    \ If there are, say, 4 new accounts one day that make a 1st post, and a moderator
    takes 15 seconds to glance at each and click an \"approved\" button, then it takes
    1 minute.\r\n\r\nIf a 1st post is spam and the account needs to be deleted, then
    no more time is spent than it takes under the current system to delete a spam
    account.\r\n\r\n(This assumes that the software is set up to present a moderator
    with a list of 1st posts from new accounts that need to be approved, so that he/she
    can review them efficiently.)\r\n\r\n> And you might be surprised at how many

    I'm not saying the system would be perfect, but I think it would weed out a lot
    of the spam.\r\n\r\nJust a thought. I know it's unlikely to be tried."

  body: "> Could a user based spam report system work?\r\n\r\nThis, damn it. Exactly
    this. \r\n\r\n1. Add a \"spam\" flag to every post/comment, and let anyone with
    a post count over 100 use it.\r\n\r\n2. Add an option to user's preferences to
    hide comments that are flagged as \"spam\" more than, say, 5 times. Turn this
    option on by default.\r\n\r\n--- bonus ---\r\n\r\n3. Instead of flagged/clean,
    let a post/comment to have 3 states - clean, possible spam, spam - with 0, 1-4
    and 5+ flags respectively. When a comment is in a \"possible spam\" range, show
    it, but gray out. Also, show a \"not spam\" flag, so to allow undoing accidental
    or mischievous flagging.\r\n\r\n4. Revoke flagging rights for those whose flagging
    collects too many \"not spam\" reversals.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1 and 2 are trivial
    to do, perhaps 2 hours of works if that much. \r\n\r\n3 and 4 are more work, but
    that's why they are bonus."
