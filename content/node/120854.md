body: Hi, I'm publishing a book and need companion fonts for P22 Cezanne, both headline
  and body fonts. I like a really modern look, like the font attached below. Does
  anyone have any ideas they are willing to share? Thanks and Namaste.

  body: Hi, the Cezanne will just be for some headers and used decoratively. There
    is 140 pages of text. Thank you!

  body: "I would avoid setting 140 pages of text in a geometric sans like Underground.\r\nIf
    you want something which contrasts Cezanne, you could try a serif with some \u201Cmechanical\u201D
    qualities, like Richler: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/richler/"
