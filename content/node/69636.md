  Edition]] was published in 2006, so I'm just curious how relevant it is since 4
  years have passed.\r\n\r\nI realize that it is listed as one of the essential books,
  but I just want to make sure that it's worth my USD$99 before I pick a copy up.
  \ How often do you consult this dense resource?  Do you feel it is outdated to the
  point where you search through fontbook.com from the get-go, bypassing the book
  altogether? \r\n\r\nI will appreciate any and all thoughts.\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: "What do you want to use it for? I have a much older, and much less exhaustive
    copy of an Agfa font catalogue, covering Adobe, Berthold, Linotype, and a few
    others in about 1995. I make use of it occasionally when I want to ID a typeface
    that doesn't come to mind immediately. I find books handier in many cases than
    online samples, although they do get dated.\r\n\r\nI have long craved that FontBook,
    but never managed to get it to the top of the \"must buy\" list. "

  body: "I would primarily use it for font identification and ideas.  Not to mention
    the fact that I have a slight feeling that it's something that I could page through
    for hours and never get enough.  I just don't really know about the price or the
    'must buy' factor.  I've found others that seem much more practical (and are easier
    on the bank).\r\n\r\nThanks for the input Don.  Much appreciated."

  body: "I don't recall the previous version, but I can definitely agree with \"<em/>could
    page through for hours and never get enough</em>.\" \r\n\r\nBest feature (other
    than the fonts): It has three ribbons to mark pages. One yellow, one black and
    one white.\r\n\r\nNot best feature: The paper is a little thin (out of necessity
    as there are so many pages).\r\n\r\nI recommend buying it for the fun factor alone."
