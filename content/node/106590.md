    to do it, post the URL & someone here can do it for you.\r\nGiven the scale of
    image, I hesitate to name the chalkboard fonts with certainty, but I expect one
    or more of our typophiles will give it a shot.\r\nDon "

    and proprietary font called 'WMF Sketch Carton', a sketched version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-scala-sans/|Scala
    Sans FF]]. You'd find some good alternatives browsing fonts tagged '[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Asketch|sketch]]'
    at MyFonts. \r\nFor the ones on the left, sorry but can't recognize any. Could
    be either bespoke or freebies. Having also a look at MyFonts to fonts tagged '[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Achalk|chalk]]'
    should be helpful. Google is also your friend. Some searches like '[[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=best+chalk+fonts|best+chalk+fonts]]'
    should work perfectly. Many people have posted their best picks. "
