  used for the letters on the old puzzle board (before they switched to an electronic
  one in 1997). The only other place I've seen it was on the play money on one of
  the home game adaptations, but never anywhere else significant.\r\n\r\nHere's a
  collage of every letter taken from various older episodes on YouTube... (you many

  looks like it could be a derivative of Beton. The closest fonts I've found are Beton
  and Rockwell, though something that stands out to me are the serifs on the E, T,
  and F. Notice how they slant outwards. Beton and Rockwell's serifs are straight.\r\n\r\nHere's
  a video where you can see some letters in very high quality:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7LGtDI4UPU"
