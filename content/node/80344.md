  somewhere. I've seen it recently used in the Swedish 'Bon' Magazine, and I doubt
  they re-drew it?\r\nSurely it's available somewhere?\r\n\r\n"

    could very well have scanned the letters and made a quick font. As an alternative,
    consider <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suomi/grumpy/?refby=typographica\">Grumpy</a>,
    a revival of Tom Carnase\u2019s ITC Grouch."

  body: Toms Roman was an Image Club font and the copy I have was bundled with something,
    most likely a 90s version of Illustrator.

    at MyFonts for completeness, since it has been a Bitstream font for several years.\""
