    Design Now</em>, published by Taschen. It\u2019s no longer in print, but was a
    mass-market book so it\u2019s easy to find a copy cheap."

    should go for \"inspiration\" is other designer's work, because it usually ends
    up yielding derivitave work if not outright rip-off.\r\n\r\nwhy not design a poster
    using the structural elements of your absolutely best CV layout ? a poster-scaled
    pop-art CV for your own service. a sort of super-graphic CV. \r\n\r\njust a thought."

  body: "Ch - What Mr. Glaser said is very true if you have a solid basis in design
    history. If not it pays to learn the history and then try to forget about it.
    Looking at other designer work for inspiration is the first part of that process.\r\n\r\nThis
    is true in all the arts. Once you have established a philosophy then inspiration
    is best sought elsewhere.\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\nAll ideas, theories and statements
    are subject to change without notice."
