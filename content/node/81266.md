  used on 'the King's Speech' movie posters. People were complaining that the font
  chosen didn't match the period or the region where the film was set.\r\n\r\nHow
  do veteran typographers select appropriate fonts for myriad applications? For example;
  what resources would be used, what research would be done to choose a typeface for:\r\n\r\n-a
  2010 film from Thailand?\r\n-a Canadian movie about WWI?\r\n-a french play based
  in 1814?\r\n\r\nAlthough I understand the importance of selecting appropriate fonts.
  (Where was the type designer born/raised, are they a man or a woman, when was the
  typeface developed) I have no idea where to even START researching this stuff.\r\n\r\nHow
  do YOU do it?\r\n"

    the reader gets the right feeling from the fonts, not the right biographical information
    on it's designer, I think. \r\n\r\nIf you don't know these feelings, books are
    not going to help. You need to look at other font uses when designing for the
    same, or similar topics. "

    they have been known to license the occasional Shinntype.)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/78520\r\n\r\nIn
    the above post, I critiqued the font choice in the film, not its promotion. However,
    IIRC, the movie ads and posters started off with some other type than Gill, before
    switching to Gill. Perhaps the discussion here was a contributing factor.\r\n\r\nTypophilers
    frequently mocked Hollywood's erstwhiile reliance on Trajan, and for the last
    year or so I've noticed that movie advertising has moved on from that generic
    era, becoming more sophisticated (like many areas of commercial design). It is
    indeed good times for contemporary typography. And using \"historically correct\"
    types is part of that picture.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\n<em>How do YOU do it?</em>\r\n\r\nConsult
    mass media from the era and region.\r\n Matt McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces
    of the Twentieth Century\" (Oak Knoll) will help identify the fonts used, at least
    in North America, so for e.g. Canadian WWI, Saturday Evening Post would be most
    promising. Sure, it was a US publication, not Canadian, but it had a huge Canadian
    distribution, and it's easy to get hold of old copies."

    time period or geographical region.\r\n\r\nFor me in order to pick a font for
    any of the above mentioned movies I would have to watch the movie first to better
    understand the characters and stories.\r\n\r\nFor example the font could just
    capture the main character or the spirit of the movie line. Sorry for not giving
    you a specific font suggestion, but there are many different ways to go about
    this."

  body: "nskyers, first keep in mind that historical accuracy of fonts is not exactly
    the highest priority for a movie director, just as they might not care if a character's
    costume, hairstyle, language -- or even the movie as a whole -- isn't historically
    accurate in every detail. \r\n\r\nThey're going for a look that communicates the
    general time and place to modern audiences, and if the details aren't right only
    a tiny percentage of people will know or care.  \r\n\r\nGraphics used in the movie
    itself (a store sign, for example) are normally prepared under the supervision
    of the movie's production designer. As reference they may assemble historical
    photos from various sources like the internet, museums, library books, field trips,
    etc.\r\n\r\nGraphics used in marketing materials (like a movie poster) are often
    prepared by a different group -- the studio's art department (or farmed out to
    an outside design firm); sometimes with the director having some input and sometimes
    not. My guess is that historical accuracy in marketing materials is a fairly low
    priority. "

    a respect of it. History is always being looked at through the lens of 'right
    now' anyway, so 100 years from now when there is a movie about a typographer in
    2011 making a poster for a film which is the story of a 1970's film studio endeavoring
    to shoot a film about the early 19th century discovery of Gold by the Dutch in
    Johannesburg... what will you do?\r\n\r\nYour best, of course..."

    that JEH Macdonald, who was an accomplished lettering artist and had a stellar
    career in commercial art in the early years of the 20th century, as well as being
