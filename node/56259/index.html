<cite>In the end, the designers decided that cut-out letters would work best for rubbings and could be effectively back-lit at night. (The typeface they chose, Optima, was designed by Hermann Zapf in 1958.) Raised letters will indicate categories like Flight 11, North Tower or Engine Company 10.

Even an element so minute had a meaningful consequence. “A big part of the whole issue are the rubbings that people will want to take of the names,” Mr. Rogér said. “That was something we never wanted to lose.”

Though some may say an American face should have been chosen (Gotham, for example, or any of the myriad others [no, not <em>that</em> Myriad]), I think Optima has an arguably American feel to it.

But more importantly, why "seriously?" in regard to Optima? Sure it's overused, happens to be a system font, and lots of other appropriate faces could have been used, but really, this is a great example of the right tool for the job (which, after all, is one of the tenets of good typography).</div>

Also, Optima may seem clichéd and overused to many typomaniacs, but that doesn't make it a bad choice. The intended audience is everybody (i.e., the general public, not just typophiles), and the face is a dignified-looking choice for a memorial.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You might find these 2 docs interesting: first is a photo of the interior of Santa Croce Basilica (in Firenze), and on the floor, you can see the gravestone (in Roman churches, it is a very common view to see gravestones of important people on the very floor of the church; most of the time an early priest, William the Conqueror on the floor of Abbaye aux Hommes in Caen / Normandy, Grace Kelly in Monaco, etc). On the second photo, you'll see a close-up of the gravestone. That's THIS gravestone Hermann Zapf used to design Optima. By looking at the letters, one can understand the genius of Zapf - Optima is quite different and refined IMHO.

It is estimated the memorial and all that belongs to it will cost something like US$500 million, and another US$40 million per year to operate it... 
I don't think an additional $60k or so (more or less the price in that dailymail article) for a custom typeface makes much of a difference... ;)</div>

You are kidding right?

"Considering that the decision was done by a committee, Optima is probably a wonderful choice."
Though I am certain that the VM font was <em>approved by</em>, I'm pretty sure that the Vietnam War Memorial font was <strong>not</strong> <em>chosen</em> by committee. It was chosen by Fud, (not the Department of Fonts and Urban Development). 

Here's something kind of funny, sad, disrespectful and PhoniShop all in one. 
http://www.sdvietnamwarmemorial.com/
Notice how the whisps of cloud and proud banner flies over, the elegant, hu?

David: "On the second photo, you’ll see a close-up of the gravestone. " 
This was not carved or penned, as you can see, so Optima must have many influences. 
This and most of the old floor type was incised and inlaid.

Bill: "So caps-only has a somewhat different character,"
...and a different tradition entirely due to monuments erected before the l.c. was around, perhaps.

it has a been a popular thing in the states to do the memorial/tombstone rubbing so it seems normal that this would be the case at the WTC memorial as well...for many many many years people have also done tombstone rubbings, i suppose as personal keepsakes/memories...and in england <a href="http://www.history.uk.com/brass_rubbing/"> brass rubbings </a> have been done for years and years...

as far as optima it does seem appropriate, not that i am a big fan of the font (due to the overuse of it at a company i worked for!)...but it hearkens back to classic roman letterforms (ie: roman square caps)...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With respect to those posting good information about Optima's pedigree, and admitting that the font looks better in use for this project than it seemed to me it would before I saw the images:

The connection to Lin's Vietman memorial is <em>precisely</em> the reason why I think Optima is a bad choice. Most people in the US would not be able to tell you Optima's name, but they have seen images of the memorial (if they haven't been there themselves), and seeing the font in political and military contexts inevitably evokes the memorial, and by extension, people's opinions about the war. I am convinced that this is why McCain's campaign chose Optima, and why they used it light against dark--to evoke the memorial, the war, and people's memories about the war, hence to associate McCain with his fallen fellow servicemen and -women and to activate the emotions and issues and divisions people used during and after the war to frame political questions and sort information about the 2008 presidential campaign.

No matter where you stand on the so-called 'global war on terror', and no matter what you think about Vietnam and about the political divisions in the US it prompted and reinforced, those emotions and issues and divisions are not an appropriate way to frame the September 11 attacks. The people who died in the crashes and collapse were not analogous to soldiers, the hijackers were not analogous to the Viet Cong or the NVA, al-Qaeda and the Islamist movement are not analogous to Chinese or Soviet communism, and the fights over how to respond to terrorism not analogous to the debates in the US between the hawks and the doves. 

To draw the connection on purpose, even in a subtle way, is to invite people to remember the attacks and evaluate policy and events in the intervening years in an unproductive and misleading way at best. At worst, it reinforces the efforts of those in the US who would like nothing more than to relive the last 40+ years of American political-culture warfare on a global stage, with new names for the antagonists.

		<div class="commentbody">It's not militarism I'm talking about; the issue isn't that visitors will somehow see Optima and want to kill terrorists harder. It's that a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks uses an important part of the design vocabulary of a prominent national monument to the soldiers who died in another war, in a way that I think unmistakably and inappropriately evokes in the viewer's mind that other war as a framework for interpreting the September 11 attacks.

Do people here think that visitors to the site will not draw the connection? As a designer, do you think that the meaning and significance of the elements you use in a design are purely a matter of the history and contexts you as the designer choose to think about (basilicas in Firenze and German type designers, not wars in SE Asia and black granite memorial walls) and not what people who see what you do bring to your design? It doesn't matter that they won't know Optima's name. William's right that Optima gets used in many contexts that don't evoke Lin's memorial. But in <em>memorial</em> contexts, where the viewer is invited to <em>mourn people who died</em>, the connection is immediate (if not wholly conscious).

People respond automatically and emotionally to elements of design all the time, based on their personal experience and the culture they share with others; designers make choices about what elements to include in their work based on the assumption that they do. Why should we think that isn't true here?</div>

Maurice, the memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks uses an important part of the design vocabulary that was there before the Vietnam Memorial, Vietnam, and even France.

A person on the city steering committee, the folks making decisions about (among other things) the logo they want to use for the graphic material for the celebrations, said, "No way.

		<div class="commentbody">I guess the problem with these subliminal connections is that they're hard to prove. Although I suspect you could set up an experiment to determine that connections are statistically significant. Might be as simple as giving a group of people a list of names set in Optima and asking them to say the first thing that pops into their minds. Compare this with the results from people who get the same list in Trajan. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, having gown up in Champaign, I know that City Hall, in the picture, is on the north side of the street, and you never see the sun rising over it :) 

Also it's not a sky scraper, not that great a building, and not typical of the look of downtown Champaign. 

And the "Champaign" has too light type. Other than that, it's great.

Oh and everybody's a critic :)

		<div class="commentbody">Sii, I don't know that it needs to be measured so precisely as that. By itself, that the font brings something directly to the front of a viewer's consciousness, or not, may not matter.

The combination of graphic elements in a space tells people in that space how those who made it expect them to think and feel about being there. If an important element in that combination brings in the frames of affect and memory (I am arguing) Optima conjures up in the American context, then those frames become part of that expectation.

(Of course, the combination of graphic elements in a space can tell people in it all sorts of things, including that the people who made it don't care about how they think and feel, or that the people who made it don't speak the language of graphic elements very well. I think the design team in the case of the NY memorial is doing things more thoughtfully than that. I just think using Optima is doing it wrong.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Outside of the fact that Optima is associated with the Vietnam Memorial, I see no reason why it should be considered a bad choice. As someone mentioned earlier, it did the job,…and did it eloquently in the context of the larger design. On the other hand, choosing another typeface that would set's its identity apart from the other well-known memorial could have been the better way to go. 

The larger question that has to be asked in this debate though,…is whether the average public, and more importantly the families of the victims, really going to care?</div>
