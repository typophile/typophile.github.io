    <BR> <BR>I consider this solved. Jim Rimmer got it right -- metal Stymie Extra
    Bold. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Minnesota Daily 1939 font &#40;Unsolved since June, some
    leads&#41; </i> <BR> <BR>We got way off track looking at different sans serifs,
    but I consider this one solved as well. That flag is clearly not a font. It&#39;s
    custom, hand-lettered, based on Coronet. I think plenty of evidence was offered
    to support this. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>
