body: "I've been tasked with making modifications to a Flash application which uses
  an embedded custom font. The font used in the first instance has since been lost:
  the version we have is a slight variation which displays a greater line-height,
  which breaks the fixed layout in many instances.\r\n\r\nI'm using <em>Type light
  3.2</em> \u2014 it seems to be the most stable free font editor available for Windows
  (<em>Font Forge</em> crashes whenever I modify the font) \u2014 to try and modify
  the font metrics to reduce the line height. <em>Line Gap</em> and <em>Typo Line
  Gap</em> were set to <code>200</code>, which I reduced to <code>0</code> for each
  (this seemed the most obvious metric to try) in an attempt to see an immediate difference,
  however the new font doesn't appear any different in any software I use to render
  it across several lines.\r\n\r\nThere are other less obvious options: I could try
  reducing the various ascender and descender values, or reduce the EM unit size,
  but these seem overly invasive and contrived ways to get around what seems fairly
  conceptually simple. Am I missing something?"

    body: "Hi T\xE9,\r\n\r\nIt isn't. The app was actually created in an old version
      of Flash before it supported paragraph styles, so it's not even possible to
      specify the line spacing (!). After a bit more experimentation, it seems that
      modifying the font metrics via <em>Type light</em> doesn't make any practical
      difference to the font's rendering \u2014 perhaps these values are here purely
      to provide visual aids for the designer in the glyph editor?"

  body: "For historical reasons, Windows and Mac obtain font-based line spacing from
    different tables: Mac gets it from the hhea table while Windows from the OS/2
    table.  See the section on <strong>Baseline to Baseline Distances</strong> in
    [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm|Recommendations for OpenType
    Fonts]].\r\n\r\nI don't know what fields <em>Type Light 3.2</em> is adjusting,
    but perhaps it is adjusting some but not all of the relevant values.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Bob,\r\n\r\nThe fields in question are <em>Line Gap</em> and <em>Typo
    Line Gap</em>. I've since found a stable release of <em>FontForge</em>, if anybody's
    more familiar with that: this also exposes a \xAB<em>Has Vertical Metrics</em>\xBB
    boolean which I can tick (I thought this might cause the <em>Line Gap</em> or
    <em>Typo Line Gap</em> to take effect, but no dice).\r\n\r\nI'm willing to concede
    that I might be going about this completely the wrong way. Maybe there's a better
    method of reducing the default line-height without modifying the glyphs? Any suggestions
    welcome."

  body: "There are actually three sets of values, two in the os/2 and one in the hhea.
    Two of these use ascent, descent and linegap settings, while the third uses only
    two values (WinAscent and WinDescent). It's possible that your flash app is not
    using linegap information and simply using ascent+descent as the line height.
    In that case you'd have to modify one or all of these values. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    I don't use FontForge, so this is as far as I can go. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nJason
