    The type in question has noticeable stroke contrast (see the V and O), of which
    Helv has very little. There was also not a lot of squooshing going on in the pre-digital

    nice catch.

  body: Would have been Typositor set originally - and maybe a bit "starved". There
    were loads of cuts of "Grot 9" floating about back then - plenty of typesetters
    cut their own versions from specimen books. Grot 9 is bang on for period.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Revolver.jpg]
