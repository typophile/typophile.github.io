  body: "Since the title says \"prestige / courier\", I presume you are looking for
    a monospaced font which is an alternative to Courier or to Prestige Elite/Prestige
    Pica.\r\n\r\nIf you were looking for a type element for an IBM Selectric, I could
    note that they had a typestyle which looked a little like the Goudy Old Style
    typeface (but not having its trademark diamond dots): Adjutant or Delegate.\r\n\r\nHmm.
    Lucida Typewriter is of some interest, but it looks like they don't make typefaces
    like what you're looking for any more. I guess that people figure now that there
    is no technical reason to have to use monospaced characters in most situations,
    there's no need to design monospaced faces that try really hard to imitate type
    (like Bookface Academic, another IBM typestyle, had done).\r\n\r\nMonospasz from
    Yanone, though, might be like what you're looking for."
