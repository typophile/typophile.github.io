body: "Good day,\r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with a logo(type) for 'nagfa'\r\n\r\nFirstly,
  a little introduction about the moniker:\r\n'nagfa' is a husband-&-wife team and
  is a combination of our names Naguib & Fadilah. \r\n\r\nThe concept behind the logotype
  is the humble ampersand, which we realised, when reflected vertically, reads easily
  as a 'g'.\r\n\r\nThus the design reads as nagfa, and at the same time hints of na&fa
  (or so we hope..)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nagfa logotype_6136.jpg]\r\n\r\nWe
  use Baskerville Old Face, simply because the '&' reads a rather convincing 'g' when
  reflected. We are wondering if there could be any other types suitable, or this
  is apt enough.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nnagfa"

  body: I think that the ampersand is not as g-ish as it should be. There is a lot
    of strange curves in ampersand that someone can read it like "gx" or something
    like that. I read "nagfa" cause I know that it is "nagfa" but I am not sure what
    other people could see.

  body: "At first glance, I read it as \"gx\" prior to reading the explanation.\r\nMaybe
    expand the typeface in illustrator and edit it to read more \"g\"like"

  body: "My obvious advice would be to draw your own g-cum-ampersand. Opening up the
    top counter, for example, and making the crossbar either less obvious or tossing
    it entirely, still clearly keeps it an ampersand but gives a lot of leeway for
    a nice quirky g.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you redraw it, you can fix the contrast. This
    Baskerville has a mainly vertical stress and \"pen angle\" (if we're being chirographic,
    in case Hrant will come in and beat me up), and the implied stress on the upside-down
    ampersand is top-right-to-bottom-left, which makes it look very much out of balance."

  body: "Thank you for the critiques. \r\n\r\nThe main peeve is still the &-g, no
    surprise (we had a similar line of thought: reads gx).\r\n\r\nRob Mientjes' suggestion
    is the most obvious, and the simplest. Instead of searching for an appropriate
    font-type - which doesn't guarantee success - we will draw a custom type.  \r\n\r\nThanks
    again!\r\n\r\nnagxfa :)"
