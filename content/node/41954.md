body: I've used OPTI Lariat Script in a layout, and apparently, the font is corrupt.
  I cannot find it anywhere to purchase it. Does anyone know if this font has been
  created under a different name, or know a source from which to purchase it? (I have
  written Castcraft, the foundry but have heard nothing yet.)

  body: Opti created nothing whatsoever original fontwise. Your desired font was originally
    Filmotype's (predigital) Lariat Script. The only other digitization I'm aware
    of is David Rakowski's <a href="http://www.faces.co.uk/fonts/Intecsas/Anderson-Script-IN20151/"
    target="_blank">Anderson Script</a>.

    But come on, it's such a familiar typeface, like Ribbon's copy, Coronet, it must
    have (or be) a doppleganger.\r\n\r\nMartha Hoyle"

    I was using Lariat Script in pull-out quotes, and the height of the caps would
    have made it awkward. Nice to know about for future projects, however."
