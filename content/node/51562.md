  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/brubecks-cube/ |Brubecks Cube]] font. \r\n\r\nI
  want it to be sensible, so I slanted it to the right, to be safe. That's the easy
  part.\r\n\r\nNow I can't decide where the shadow sides should fall.\r\n\r\nWhen
  the shadow-sides are on the bottom and right it makes all the letter look like they
  were cut out of sheetcake. Like a bunch of typographic cake laid out on the table
  in front of me. Mmmm. Tasty. But maybe it's a bit too safe. Not interesting enough.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/15456_brubeck_ital1_5677.gif]\r\nSo
  I did a second drawing, letting the shadows fall on the top and left instead. Now
  the letters don't look like cake anymore. They look a bit like buildings, like I'm
  flying in on a helicopter. Except the italicization makes it look like all the buildings
  are falling over. Oh no!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/15458_brubeck_ital2_3780.gif]\r\n\r\nShould
  it be shadows on top, or shadows on bottom?\r\n\r\n-chank\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "While I appreciate the second set of drawings I have always felt shadows
    should reflect the direction of design. Upper left to lower right. So as the sun
    shines from from the upper left the shadows would fall low and right.\r\n\r\nBut
    there again I am \"old and in the way\" (let's see which upstarts get that one)
    and the kids are doing whatever the hell they want to : ) And the second set would
    serve its own purpose as a variation.\r\n\r\nYou ain't no spring chicken either
    Chank, so go for broke.  Double :: ))\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: '#1 seems more natural to me too, but I can see #2 working too, and perhaps
    even better, on posters that might be hung vertically at eye-height or higher.'

    be on display in the neighborhood here in January I reckon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/15505_Obama_Hooray_5931.jpg]\r\n\r\nalso,
    the font is all done now. I opted for the more safe\r\nand traditional shadows
    falling to the bottom right,\r\nbut I think there might be another variation coming\r\nsome
    day in the future.\r\n\r\nBrubecks Cube Italic, aka Brubecks Rhomboid is here:\r\nhttp://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5685\r\n\r\n-chank"
