  project and would like to know what the issues were that they addressed. Because
  it's paired with Avenir in my project it seemed most natural to stay close to Frutiger's
  version, but I've never spent much time with Egyptian faces.\r\n\r\nThx\r\n\r\n"

    I don't know too much about it, except that it was\r\ndone (or at least started)
    by Gurtler's students, and their classroom\r\nnumber was 505.\r\n\r\nOne thing
    I would suggest that you take\r\na close look at in E505 are the numerals.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    much about it.\r\n\r\nHere's a comparison of 505 on left with the version of Egyptienne
    on Adobe's font site (which I guess comes from Linotype).\r\n\r\nThese are just
    quick screen captures so very low quality.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/egyptienne.jpg]"
