body: I am trying to identify the typeface The Observer out of London uses for their
  body text. It looks very similar to Miller, which is what The Guardian was using
  before they switched to their own version of Egyptian. Any thoughts?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/observer_bodytxt_4463.jpg]
