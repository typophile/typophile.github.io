body: "We have a project with an existing hand-painted logotype.\r\n\r\nThis is a
  moderately decortive bodoni-esque swash two word logotype.\r\n\r\nWe need to refine
  the letterforms and create a final digitized version.\r\nYou would be working from
  a high-resolution scan of the logotype.\r\n\r\nThis is not a pure digitization job,
  but more a refinement and correction of the painted letter forms.\r\n\r\nPlease
  contact me directly if you are interested in the project.\r\n\r\n<strong>Kyle Hildebrant</strong>\r\nkyle@brandsbyovo.com\r\n\r\n<strong>Please
  email examples of (or links to) similar work, or work that would give us faith in
  your capabilities.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis would be a 'Work for Hire' situation. You
  would be given proper credit, and would be granted limited rights to use the work
  for your own personal/promotional use.\r\n\r\nThanks guys!\r\n\r\n<em>(Please, serious
  professional inquiries only)</em>"
