  magazine. The client uses VAG rounded std, but offcourse i'm not keen on using this
  for text, only for display.\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend a family (serif/sans: light-regular-bold)
  which combines well with VAG? \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nMarco\r\n"

    for a magazine, or know if it's a real 'workhorse'? \r\n\r\nI'm not only looking
    for fonts that 'match' VAG. \r\n\r\nMaybe a totally different sans or even serif
    will do the job?\r\n\r\nMarco\r\n"
