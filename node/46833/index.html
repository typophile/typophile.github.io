<p>Yesterday, I went to my local supermarket to pick up more Instant Quaker Oatmeal for my mother-in-law. (The only thing she eats anymore, god bless her, at 92.)</p>
<p>At first I couldn&rsquo;t find her beloved Peaches &amp; Cream - and then I did, looking like a box of elbow macaroni.</p>
<p>I was wondering what you thought about this. It isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;design&rdquo; question - I felt it more appropriate in general discussion, as hopefully, none of us designed this.</p>
<p>The one on the left was the package they have been using for years, nicely balanced, well thought out - fun with type&hellip;
the one on the right is there new and improved - or as they say, &ldquo;New Look, Same Great Taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to influence you - but am I the only one that thinks they hired a kid out of school who had to prove he was worth the salary they were giving him?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear your opinions. Honest.</p>
<p>P.S. I know that Quaker Oats was having some problems and the US government made them change some of the claims on their packaging. That might have been the excuse for a new design, but I would have liked to see a design first.</p>

<p>In NY when I owned a typeshop and some pretty rotten designs came through - the old pros would laugh and say, it looks like someone who just came out of art school. The joke was that so many do graduate from art school and think they are suppose to be art directors right away, instead of learning more in a professional environment. (My own stepson was like that too.) What I was saying is that someone in the company has to justify the salary &ndash; or what happened in publishing, when they got rid of the 6-figure art director and switched to someone that barely was wet behind the ears&hellip; I hope that makes sense &ndash; it&rsquo;s just the old NY Typographer in me rambling on&hellip;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The new design emphasizes the cream; the background is clean and white and the pitcher is fully in view. They reduced the size of &ldquo;Peaches and Cream&rdquo; but also seem to have reduced the size of &ldquo;ARTIFICIALLY FLAVORED&rdquo;. The color blue now occupies space at the top and bottom of the package, which helps remind me of the round blue oatmeal containers. Not terrible, although in the picture, &ldquo;Peaches and Cream&rdquo; seems a bit harder to read.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Alas, a grocery post! Growing up in the family grocery store, stocking boxes of Apple Jacks, Cocoa Puffs, and Sugar Smacks at age ten, I was fortunate to get weekly, intimate exposure to package design. Some I loved, others I hated. My brother and I would sit together in an aisle, on milk crates, and every once in a while pose a &ldquo;which is cooler?&rdquo; question. Liquid Plumr or Drano? Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines? Speas or Tree Top? Hi-C or Haiwaiian Punch?</p>
<p>Not many things in the grocery store are more classic than that Quaker Oats cylinder. It breaks my heart every time a brand chooses to redesign its packaging for the sake of &ldquo;updating.&rdquo; Yes, I love technology (but not as much as you, you see), but thank God for Quisp. I think it&rsquo;s the only kid&rsquo;s cereal cartoon character that hasn&rsquo;t been destroyed with Illustrator gradients.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/quisp-cereal_5851.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As for the new Quaker packaging, fine. Go ahead and ruin a good thing. That&rsquo;s about all I can say anymore. I&rsquo;m tired of seeing it happen. Creamette, Mountain Dew, Oxydol&hellip; But if I could have my way, I think it would make much more sense to model the instant oatmeal packaging after the classic cylinder, something more like this one:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/quaker-oats_3997.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The bottom line is I&rsquo;m sick to death of drop shadows, gradients, and outer glows, and I crave flat colors and hard lines. It&rsquo;s an opinion, I suppose, but I often wonder how much package updating is done only because it has become so easy to do it, and student-just-out-of-school or no student-just-out-of-school, 21st century designers love their digital effects.</p>

<p>the classic two tone (as posted by koppa) is quite strong. i agree with him about the glut of gradations and shadows. this trend in designers getting excited about new (soon to be old) filters until you see them everywhere is fascinating and at times hilarious.</p>

<p>But surely they are a legitimate and integral part of, for instance, the &ldquo;Peaches &amp; Cream&rdquo; lettering on the left package?
Without the dropshadow, the light weight white-on-orange type would not stand out strongly, as indeed is the case with those words on the new package, where they have been given less importance, relative to the brand name, than before.</p>
<p>I suspect that both designs are representative of an evolving concept of brand packaging at different points in time, going from something which spells out OATMEAL and an exciting flavor, Peaches &amp; Cream, in big jazzy letters, to something cool and discreet that doesn&rsquo;t need to shout what is an established flavor, and focuses on the wordmark Quaker and the picture of the product. The new corporate-technical look also has a nutraceutical vibe; I can&rsquo;t see what else is on the package, but I bet there&rsquo;s something about how healthy oatmeal is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell much more with the picture supplied by Jackie. The details aren&rsquo;t sufficiently clear.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m really certain of tho, some of the people on this thread aren&rsquo;t so much concerned about package design as they are reluctant to accept change.</p>
<p>@Koppa: <em>But keep in mind, as proverbed, we are what we eat. Quite literally, actually. It’s pure science.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a simplistic load of nonsense, transparently unscientific and not true at all. Our bodies manufacture what they need from the food we ingest. While it&rsquo;s true an impoverished diet makes people less than healthy, we are much more than just what we eat. We are walking bio-chemical factories. Some of what we don&rsquo;t eat our bodies manufacture. The old proverb &ldquo;we are what we eat&rdquo; has a basic truth to it, but technically it&rsquo;s not accurate. In this day and age it has the credence of and old wive&rsquo;s tale.</p>

To inform the consumer of what is in the box?
To tell the consumer who made the stuff in the box?
To protect and contain the product?</p>
<p>All of these are necessary, of course, but it seems that brand identification has taken precedence over product identification with the new design. The only text smaller than the &ldquo;INSTANT OATMEAL&rdquo; line is the one that says &ldquo;ARTIFICIALLY FLAVORED&rdquo;. It does allow more space to display the product photo without an intersecting orange rectangle, but without close inspection it could be any kind of mush.</p>
<p>There are reasonable arguments on either side regarding promoting brand over product, but Quaker is such a well recognized brand, especially in the context of oatmeal, that the logo speaks for its self, and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be spelled out in bold letters larger than anything else on the box. The new design tells me the opposite. There is no question that this is a Quaker product, but is it oatmeal?</p>

<p>I feel that if a company is going to take the time and money to redesign a product - that is what they should do. I feel their new design is borrowed from the Pasta Packaging shelves of my local supermarket.</p>
<p>And at 92, if Helen wants her instant oatmeal - then by golly, that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;ll get. It&rsquo;s about the only thing she still enjoys eating. I have learned that as you get older your taste buds die - and you are left with just the taste buds that taste &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; and that is a very good word to describe Peaches and Cream.

<p>I understand that our bodies are complex, and I am impressed with your explanation. But, simplistic as that old proverb may be, it holds true for me. Our bodies take what they need from what we put into them, be it through eating, drinking, breathing, or by needles. Without scientific evidence to back it up, I&rsquo;m willing to believe that good, wholesome inputs are the preferred building blocks for our bodies, and that artificial ingredients, chemicals, and corn corn corn cause unnecessary stress on our bodies. Can the ol' bod handle it? Sure. Would it rather not? Probably.</p>
<p>(This has a little bit to do with type)</p>
<p>I might be one who comes off as resistant to change, but not so fast&hellip; I don&rsquo;t care for change for the sake of change, and I don&rsquo;t see all change as progress. I am more interested in timelessness, and I get bummed out when I see what I thought was a timeless piece of design tossed out the window in favor of today&rsquo;s cutting-edge style. Change for the better, on the other hand&hellip;that is something I like very much.</p>
