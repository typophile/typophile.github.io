The screen snapshot is stored in the camera roll, which you can sync with a folder on your PC (via iTunes), and then open in your favorite image program to get a closer look.

There are not really a lot of type-centric apps (yet), unfortunately. There is a very simple modular font editor (similar to FontStruct in concept) called Fontula. There's also a simple font editor called iFontMaker. Seems to be best suited to fonts that have a hand-drawn (or -scribbled) look. I haven't tried it.

I think part of the reason there is a dearth of type- or font-related apps is that there is no way (yet) to install fonts beyond what it comes with. On the other hand, it does support web fonts in the web browser, so you can view other fonts on it if they are being served on the web.</div>

That's the bane of capacitive (versus resistive*) touchscreens. To be fair you can buy a special stylus** though - I wonder if that makes iFontMaker's results more refined.

* I wonder about the new infrared stuff coming out now.

You can, but the zoom level only goes up to about 2x, and the pixels are interpolated, so maybe not so good for getting a closer look.

What I meant about iFontMaker is that it doesn't have a Bézier pen tool or anything similar. You just trace strokes with your finger (or special stylus—I've got one and it is more natural for drawing). There is at least one app that has Bézier drawing—miniDraw HD—but so far no one has created a font editor for the iPad with such a tool. </div>

Figures.  :-/
But there must be some "paint" app that lets you zoom in, right?

iFontMaker: I do realize it's for painting the bodies of letters, as opposed to defining outlines; but at least you could do a calligraphic font, if you had enough control. Otherwise it's just finger-painting... literally!  :-)

miniDraw-HD: since it's hard to imagine producing a full working font on a portable device anyway (especially one that can't actually use the fonts you make...) this might be adequate for fleshing out ideas.

BTW, when you run an iPhone HD app on the iPad, does it display at 960x640 with a border, or does it scale up to 1024x768?

There are 3 kinds of apps —1)  iPhone apps, 2) iPad apps, and 3) Universal apps (designed for both iPhones and iPads)

1) If you run an iPhone app on an iPad, the image will not fill the screen and will have a large black border around it. Or you can press the 2x button and the image will increase to almost full screen, but will still have a border and will be very pixilated.

2) If you run an iPad app, it will fill the screen. 

3) If you run a Universal app on an iPad, it will be hi res and fill the screen. I presume that Universal apps require that the developer create 2 sets of screens (iPhone and iPad), since the size & proportions of the screens aren't the same. In fact I believe Apple describes Universal apps as essentially being 2 apps (an iphone app and an iPad app) that are bundled together.</div>

No, all iPhone apps, whether HD or not, are displayed small on an iPad unless you press the 2x button, in which case they are pixel doubled which make them larger but pixilated. Even the HD ones act this way. This may seem illogical, but there's a reason.

iPhone HD apps must have 2 sets of bitmapped graphics, to accomodate the resolution of both older iPhones and newer iPhones. If you play an iPhone app on an iPad, it uses the smaller version of the graphics. 

Why? Because Apple doesn't want developers to think that an HD iPhone app is "good enough" for iPads too. Apple wants developers to create separate iPad versions, so the screen sizes are correct and all the interface elements are properly designed and sized for an iPad, rather than just being an iPhone app displayed larger than originally intended, which often results in clunky, oversized buttons, etc.

So Apple makes sure that iPhone apps will play on an iPad, but won't look that great. That prods the developers to create real iPad versions.</div>

This is exactly the sort of thing that turns me off.

Especially considering that huge black border that's there anyway I think 960x640 is close enough to 1024x768 that it would be nice to simply run iPhone HD apps as-is rather than ignoring the available data and displaying a cruddy version.

It is a really simple text pad application that is void of all distractions and unnecessary options.  I bought it for both my iPad and Macbook, it's quite fantastic.

Another app that is quite cool (only on iPhone though) is the [[http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-typography-manual/id321091154?mt=8|Typography Manual]].  While I realize this is an app geared for people new to typography, it still has some interesting information and tools/resources in it.

I wish there was an app that had a massive stockpile of typefaces you could browse through and examine closely.  There is one app that does this to some degree, but it is poorly made.

That can be arranged.  I assume you would be most interested in see it rasterized as black on white, with the ability to control the point size even increments.

I've seen no evidence of fonts being rendered live <em>and</em> aliased in iOS environs. So no hinting is used, though I do not know if the iOS even carries the code to do so. 

>Has anybody made a font that's superhinted for CT? 

If "superhinted for CT" is a relative term, then the CT collection is such an example, being hinted for nothing else. 

>I mean controlling the exact (or near-exact) subpixel rendering with deltas?

You missed a lot of discussion on <a href="http://typophile.com/comment/reply/62675">this</a>. The short answer is that all horizontal scaling in Windows, including glyphs and glyph widths, is out of hinting's reach when CT is enabled.

And then I'll continue <a href="http://typophile.com/node/82202">here</a>, when time permits. I'm in "Edison mode" until weds :D

Because, as I mentioned somewhere, I'm actually smelling a rise in the relevance of hand-made (anti-aliased, maybe even subpixel) bitmap fonts...

Do the CT fonts contain delta hints to control individual subpixels at specific point sizes? What I'm looking for is the subpixel (or at least anti-aliased) equivalent to the old MS Core Fonts.

BTW, when I say "zoom" I don't mean just making text larger - I'm talking about zooming in to the <em>rendering</em> of a given font/size on the screen's bitmap. The point being to see what's going on, in order to design fine-tuned fonts.

It's simple enough to grab an iPad screen and bring it to your development platform for detailed viewing. There's really no call on the iPad for zooming to "fat bits" in the old terminology. 

>Currently I imagine it has to do with keeping system resources to a minimum for maximum performance.

To a great extent I think this is as good a guess as any. I think it's also that Apple's not interested in the installation and laying about of fonts not required for a specific purpose. Fonts can come and go via browser, and by apps, which pretty takes care of mobile requirements up to gratuitous fonts.

I suspect you're right. And also the main way to load resources onto an iPad is via a sync with iTunes, so you'd need to load fonts via iTunes which perhaps would create some technical challenges. But I'm sure the ability for load fonts will come in the future.</div>

Well less than half of that, if you subscribe.

 No one wanting to steal your recyclables is hardly a great attribute, but hide your iGads in a newspaper then.

And then don't forget to take that hidden gadget out before collecting up 400 lbs of recyclables and driving ten miles round trip to a waste management center monthly...

Certainly there are some advantages to paper newspapers, but it's clear that the the future is electronic publications.

I doubt if many newspapers will still be publishing paper editions 10 years from now. Or if they do, it'll probably be reduced-size versions that only come out a few times a week, for the benefit of the small percentage of their subscribers who in 2021 still want paper versions.

Same thing with magazines and books. Already Amazon reports that it sells more Kindle books than printed books. 

I have mixed feelings about this as I love traditional books. But I've got to admit that I buy most of my books now on my iPad. It's just so darn convenient.</div>

If you click the "Punchcut gig" at the bottom of the Forums page, you will be informed, post haste, that "Mobile is not a Device, It's a Lifestyle." If so, it's a lifestyle which some among us--admittedly dinosaurs--choose not to embrace, for a variety of reasons. A story in today's <em>Washington Post</em> details the World Health Organization's latest opinion of cellphone usage, and it's not pretty, i.e., "possibly carcinogenic." The WHO admits that its findings are incomplete, but does not back off from the claim of "possibily." Of course, one can easily dismiss the possibility, as do deniers of global warning, but at what cost? I, for one, am not willing to make the gamble... </div>

To answer your question, Hrant, I don't know. I would guess if there is a prohibition on selling one's services on the forum, it would be in forum terms of participation. You might try asking on http://stackoverflow.com . Also would probably be a good place to ask about developer forums.</div>

>No, all iPhone apps, whether HD or not, are displayed small on an iPad unless you press the 2x button, in which case they are pixel doubled which make them larger but pixilated.

Not if you install RetinaPad extension.
With it, the HD Iphone apps are rendered properly in the 2x mode. They become nearly indistinguishable from Ipad versions in terms of quality. And with old sans-HD programs, at least you get clear unpixilated type.

Granted, the nifty program requires a jailbroken device.</div>
