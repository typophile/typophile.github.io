    that complements your choice. Otherwise your options will be severely limited.  '

  body: But quite a number of Chinese typefaces do throw in Latin and Cyrillic and
    Greek as afterthoughts. That the choices of style for those other languages will
    be severely limited, though, is true - while "almost any Chinese font" for the
    appropriate coding scheme will support those languages, they won't necessarily
    do it well.
