  The only well-known logo that I can think of is for Bloomingdale's. I have attached
  the logo to this post.\r\n\r\nI would like to use the double-O ligature in the title
  of a publication, but feedback from someone said that overlapping O's reminded her
  of unity, or gender symbols (male and female). \r\n\r\nI think the double-o ligature
  looks classy and is reminiscent of the Arts & Crafts movement as well as the Art
  Nouveau style.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?"
