  a new company logo. I'd love it if you could assist me with this questions:\r\n\r\n1)
  I've found an almost exact font called:poppl-residenz\r\nhttp://www.bertholdtypes.com/font/poppl-residenz/pro/\r\n\r\nIs
  the \"renaissance\" font a fake, and by using It will I be in violation of copyrights?\r\n\r\n2)
  If the latter is the case, then How should i go about Purchasing the \"poppl-residenz\"
  font for my commercial purposes ? \r\n\r\nThanks alot ! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and you will almost certainly end up with a much higher quality font by doing
    so.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
