		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Žydrius, 
as far as I know, the answer is no. Maybe there’s something new in CS4?</p>
<p>I use a little workaround that is almost as fast as having only one style:</p>
<ul><li>set up two paragraph styles: one without indent (#1), one with indent (#2)</li><li>within the style options for #1, set the ‘next’ parameter to ‘#2’</li><li>select all your text and ‘apply paragraph style #1 and then next’*, via a right-click (control-click) in the paragraph style palette</li>
</ul>
*) I don’t know how the exact wording is in the English version

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The simplest way to achieve this, in my opinion, is the good old-fashioned way. One paragraph style for your basic text style. Include a tab position at the first indent. Use a tab at the beginning of every paragraph except the first one. Seems unsophisticated, I know. But after years of trying to be fancy about it, I realized that simplest is best.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;d second what Kent says. Been doing it that way for 25 years, seems to work fine.</p>
<p>You can set the tab position in your paragraph style(s), so each time you hit the tab, you will get the indent. And of course, with different paragraph styles, you can have a different indent value. I frequently use 1 pica for a text paragraph indent, but 1 em (further) for an extract paragraph indent.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You know, when I started out, I thought &ldquo;tabs are for typewriters, we have computers now&rdquo; and I used to try to work with paragraph indents in styles. But that just led to a population of multiple parent/child paragraph styles. Not to mention the fact that I was constantly having to remove the tabs that copywriters and editors were putting in their copy (silly editors ;-). And then applying all these multiple paragraph styles.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it didn&rsquo;t take long to see the error of my ways. Fancy-schmancy; simple is better.</p>
<p>Now, on the off-chance that I get a manuscript without tabs, all I have to do is search for paragraph breaks and replace with  para break + tab. Then remove the few that come after a heading. Not too onerous.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here I go again, getting into trouble. In my view, it is essential for any professional layout to be open ended, transparent and reusable.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are: the possibility of a reprint with corrections, a typesetter dying before second edition, etc. All pretty common sense, and obvious. Nothing really that could be called &ldquo;a time saver&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The rule is simple and universal, eliminating all misunderstandings: no extra characters in files. <strong>Not one.</strong></p>
<p>What has just been recommended above can be extended to hitting a return to start a new line, or return and any numbers of spaces to align a hanging indent in a list. Just that authors type a tab or five spaces in a row for indented paragraphs does not mean that we should keep them and forget how to use paragraph indents.</p>
<p>As to the original question, use two styles. One with no first line indent, and the other one with some first line indent. Then figure out a way to apply them simply, as has been suggested.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This was another aspect of TeX that could be handy for very standardized documents. When you say in TeX that the style for every paragraph after a subheading will not be indented, TeX would just make it happen. If you&rsquo;re formatting standardized articles where this is always the case, it is a nice feature to have. I&rsquo;m not sure why there is no &ldquo;Force next style&rdquo; option for paragraph styles in InDesign, which is I think what Zydrunas was hoping for.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry to be posting excessively here, but after some experimentation, I was able to formulate a compromised solution based on the video I linked to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create your paragraph styles. For example a nonindented style called &ldquo;noindent&rdquo; and an indented style called &ldquo;indent&rdquo;.</li>
<li>In the options for &ldquo;noindent&rdquo; select the next style as &ldquo;indent&rdquo;.</li>
<li>For the &ldquo;indent&rdquo; style select the next style as &ldquo;same style&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Select all the paragraphs in a section for which you want this sequence to apply.</li>
<li>Right-click (or option click) on the style called &ldquo;noindent&rdquo; and select &lsquo;apply &ldquo;noindent&rdquo; then next style&rsquo;</li>
<li>This will format all the selected paragraphs accordingly: the first selected paragraph will be &ldquo;noindent&rdquo; while the remainder of selected paragraphs will be &ldquo;indent&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason why this doesn&rsquo;t quite solve the original problem is that it requires a person to manually identify sections before applying the style sequence. It answers the question in that it is still easier than formatting each paragraph individually. Ideally there would be a way to either identify sections to which style sequences (groups?) could apply, or a way to specify that for particular styles, the following style should automatically update itself to be the one listed as &ldquo;next&rdquo; style. (Persistent linked styles)</p>
<p>As for GREP, it seems that from within ID, it is only useful for character strings within paragraphs, and not relations of paragraphs. There might be a way to automate this feature with JavaScript, but on that I&rsquo;m ignorant.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Florian: Hehe, I guess so &hellip; Sorry to have not read your post carefully! Looks like Jan missed the significance of your your post as well. I guess the only thing I added was to make it clear that if the final style of the sequence is set to &ldquo;same style&rdquo; as the next style, then it will apply that final style to all subsequent paragraphs in the selected text&mdash;the &ldquo;looping&rdquo; aspect, as Jan puts it. I hadn&rsquo;t gathered this significance from what you originally wrote.</p>
<p>By the way, I really admire the work on your portfolio site. Wonderfully designs that are well represented.</p>
