  upon a typeface family called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/libertypefoundry/liber-serif/\">Liber</a>.
  It reminded me strongly of Luc(as) de Groot\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/floris/\">Floris</a>,
  which is mentioned as having \u201Cinspired\u201D Liber.\r\n\r\nI started to compare
  glyph forms and found some to be strikingly similar (white is Floris Text, as shown
  in the type tester on lucasfonts.com, black is Liber, as shown in a PDF from the
  <a href=\"http://www.libertypefoundry.com\">foundry website<a>):\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/regular_4473.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/italic_4583.png]\r\n\r\nIs
  this what you typically would get when one typeface inspires another? The serifs
  and ascender/descender length obviously differentiate the two from one another,
  but I was wondering whether it is advisable to stay that close to the source. Or
  am I underestimating the importance of these variances? And: Is it allowed to create
  \u2018version 2.0\u2019 of an existing typeface? \r\n\r\nI would like to hear some
  thoughts on that. Thanks!"

  body: It would be very important to have the creator of Liber to comment on this.
    Derivative work is not wrong as long as you are incorporating meaningful innovations
    that will further the original idea or take it in a different direction. If a
    derivated work is so close as to be confused with the original... well that's
    not so cool.

  body: "In addition to what H\xE9ctor said, it looks like the outlines we re-used,
    which is always a no-no without permission. Since Wastian directly mentions Floris*
    he's clearly not trying to hide it; so either he got De Groot's permission (unlikely),
    he doesn't grasp that it's not OK (so an honest mistake) or he doesn't care that
    people think it's not OK (which is not OK).\r\n\r\n* Which I will point out is
    itself strongly reminiscent of De Groot's own Folha, a typeface for a newspaper
    in Wastian's home country... So maybe check Liber against Folha too. BTW, some
    Brazilian designers apparently call Floris \"Le Folha\".  :-)\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/6256#comment-44171\r\n\r\nUnless
    Wastian did get permission, MyFonts should pull the font aysap, and both MyFonts
    and Wastian should forward any proceeds to De Groot.\r\n\r\nRecent and strongly
    related:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/49909#comment-497798\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    established a reputation with some genuinely \u201Cnon-inspired\u201D typeface
    designs, then it\u2019s OK to publish stuff that\u2019s quite similar to someone
    else\u2019s work. Myriad/Frutiger and Gotham/Proxima are well-known examples of
    this double standard.\r\n\r\n(The above is not my position, just an observation

    Lucas lodges a complaint with myfonts\u2014if past behavior is any indication\u2014they
    will pull the plug on Liber, no questions asked. Recovering ill-gotten gains is
    another matter, probably one for a civil court to decide, should one be so inclined

    Floris:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>[De Groot\u2019s] most original achievement (\u2026)
    was the spirited headline face designed for the Brazilian newspaper <cite>Folha
    de S\xE3o Paulo. Folha</cite> differs from his other original typefaces in that
    it has strong vertical stress. (\u2026) In 2001 De Groot designed a new headline
    face for <cite>Le Monde,</cite> which was named <cite>Floris Newspaper</cite>
    after his son. Floris is a continuation of Folha: it has vertical stress, narrow
    forms and a somewhat rectangular oval as a basic shape. The family is now much
    larger. It comes in seven weights, from Extra Light to Black. Its regular works
    well as a condensed text face. (<a href=\"http://books.google.de/books?id=sR9g5xPPJVQC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA225#v=onepage&q&f=false\">Jan
    Middendorp: Dutch Type.</a>)</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n<blockquote>In 2007,
    Floris was redrawn as part of a drastic redesign of the German weekly <cite>Jungle
    World. Floris JW</cite> is a headline family in weights, from ExtraLight to Black.
    The <cite>Jungle World</cite> project also resulted in <cite>Floris Text,</cite>
    a new typeface for publications, which is still under development. (LF Floris
    on <a href=\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/floris/about/\">lucasfonts.com</a>)</blockquote>"
