  for a few days now.\r\n\r\nI've gone through What the Font? & Identifont.\r\n\r\nWTF?
  gave me \"Cyne\" as an option. It is close on some accounts, but way off on others.\r\n\r\nId...gave
  me 30 \"similar\" fonts based on describing the letters, though they (it) neglected
  to ask me the right questions...stupid website. Century Gothic was close, but again,
  not quite right.\r\n\r\nAnyway...this is for a job I am working on. I was sent other
  jobs already created, with everything in paths. Now they want me to create additional
  products with the same style, but (surprisingly), they don't know what font was
  used and apparently can't track down the original designer.\r\n\r\nYour mission,
  should you choose to accept it is to identify this elusive typeface so that I can
  get on with the rest of my life, and other jobs.\r\n\r\nThanks."
