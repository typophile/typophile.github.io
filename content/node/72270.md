body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a text face mainly intended for magazines.\r\nIt's
  a low-contrast wedge-serif. My aim is good legibility at small sizes (9pt).\r\n\r\nLooking
  forward for your valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nAlso I have some problems with hinting,
  letters start to wobble on screen in 400% zoom. \r\nI did some manual hinting on
  top of autohinting(opentype) and it got better.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wob2_6381.png]"

  body: "this is really nice. it's got a great texture to it.\r\nenough punch to give
    it character yet not too dazzling.\r\n\r\nI'd either make make the opening of
    the /g/ descender larger or just close it up, not sure how much of a difference
    keeping it that small would make around 9pt. Perhaps same with the open /k/ join.\r\n\r\nThe
    /y/ descender is great. I love the subtle curve it has. Interesting /U/ as well.
    Definitely keep working on this."

  body: "I agree this is nice work.\r\nI see wobbliness in alignment and thicknesses
    not only on screen but on my printed page - is that all due to hinting problems?
    Consequently some of the unevenness I see (thinness of B's top bowl, thickness
    of thick part of g's bottom loop) may need a hinting rather than a drawing fix.\r\nI
    think E and F could be a touch wider, and L two touches wider.\r\n"

    the proof it feels too thin, especially in smaller sizes."

    this that reminds me of Oldrich Menhart's amazing Czech Modernist typefaces. Very
    nice.\r\n"

    FDK autohinter improved things a bit. I think the problem might be in alignment
    zones.\r\n\r\nJean Paul, yes, 'B' is troublesome \u2014\_I also tried extending
    it.\r\n\r\nMax, you're right \u2014\_there is a broad-nib calligraphic link, partly
    inspired by Menhart."

  body: "Matthew, \r\n\r\nThe crossbar of /t/ is generally lower than x-height and
    is related to the crossbar of /f/, so I changed the /f/ accordingly.\r\nThough
    the relationship is very design-specific. In New Baskerville /f/'s crossbar is
    lower than /t/'s, whereas New Century SchoolBook, and didone typefaces share the
    same height. This is also dependant on hook of /f/.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a text face, maybe just go with round.\r\n\r\nBut overall it's quite nice, keep

  body: "Hi!\r\nI think is coming great, congrats.\r\n\r\nThings I see:\r\n- the leg
    of \"k\", \"K\" and \"R\" could be a problem whem printing, it could generate
    a lot of black.\r\n- final tail stroke in the \"g\" doesn't match very well with
    the sistem you are trying to acomplish. It shouldn't be so pointy, perhaps something
    more like your \"j\"\r\n- \"s\" kind of heavy\r\n- \"A\" is thin and the middle
    stroke is too low\r\n- \"G\" and \"U\" is too wide (compare the white space with
    the other letters\r\n-  Lining numbers are kind of boldish\r\n\r\nKeep up the
    good work\r\nRegards."
