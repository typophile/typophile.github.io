    did not survive 500 years of time any more than we know what will be considered
    good work 500 years from now and what will be considered the crap of our time
    by those in the future. One thing is clear, if we do nothing now, there will be
    nothing to judge in the future.  Only the most arrogant among us can pretend they
    know what future generations will cherish.  After all, we can&#39;t &#40;thank
    heaven&#41; even agree among ourselves now on what is wheat and what is chaff.  I
    am sure Van Gogh didn&#39;t have a clue in his life that any one of his paintings
    would sell for millions of dollars after his death.   <BR>   The only danger is
    doing nothing.  We should all design our brains out as we individually see fit.   <BR>

  body: 'I greatly admire innovative work in type design, including Nick&#39;s, but
    I do not think his - your - view  <BR>on this is quite right in the case of type.
    <BR> <BR>For computers, better ones have made past ones more or less obsolete.  <BR>As
    a general rule, there is no point in using the last generation of computers. <BR>
    <BR>With type, I think the analogy is more to architecture than computers. <BR>
    <BR>I live in the Washington DC area, and two of the best monumental buildings
    in the area are the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/linc/" target="_blank">Lincoln
    memorial</a> and <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Dulles_Airport.html"
    target="_blank">Dulles Airport</a>.  <BR>The Lincoln Memorial is more or less
    a copy of a Greek temple, with the fabulous statue of Lincoln in the middle.  <BR>Dulles,
    designed by Eero Saarinan, is an icon of modern design, with its sweeping wing-like
    roof. <BR> <BR>Was it a mistake to copy an Greek temple in the late 19th century?  <BR>No,
    because of the resonance with ancient ideals of democracy, and what Lincoln stood
    for in extending these ideals to all Americans.  <BR>Also by simply doing a copy,
    they didn&#39;t mess it up, but got a fabulous result. <BR> <BR>Saarinen&#39;s
    design was very much of its time, but when it came to expanding it a few years
    ago, they just doubled the length, not changing anything.  <BR>In fact this was
    the original design, and Saarinen had adjusted the design so that only half could
    be built first.  <BR> <BR>Was it stupid to simply build a 60&#39;s design in 2000?
    I don&#39;t think so.  <BR>It works beautifully. <BR> <BR>Now it would have been
    stupid in the &#39;60s to build an airport as a Greek temple.  <BR>Having a modern
    building was appropriate and worked well. <BR> But expanding it in the 60s style
    - the only smart thing to do. <BR> <BR>I think these examples illustrate that
    what is appropriate in design and use in relation to history is a complicated
    matter,  <BR>and that newer is not necessarily better.  <BR>There is a place for
    historical revivals, and they are sometimes better than the contemporary  <BR>-
    and sometimes not.  <BR> <BR>I may be wrong but I detect in Nick&#39;s arguments
    some buying into Hegel&#39;s idea of the &#39;zeitgeist&#39;, the spirit of the
    times.  <BR>Of course, fashions are a reality, but what Hegel is claiming is that
    some are superior, the &#39;wave of the future&#39;,  <BR>and that everything
    that doesn&#39;t go along with the Zeitgeist is backward.  <BR>The same type of
    thinking goes is in the somewhat different idea that there is an &#39;avant garde&#39;,  <BR>and
    everything else done is more or less stale and worthless.  <BR> <BR>Fashion is
    exciting in itself, and I have nothing against it.  <BR>But most fashions go stale
    and a few turn out to be lasting.  <BR>Because something is innovative doesn&#39;t
    mean it is necessarily good or most appropriate for every project and setting.  <BR>In
    many cases old and good is better even than new and good.  <BR>And of course the
    other way around is also often true. <BR> <BR>A new design that is good is a greater
    personal achievement for the designer,  <BR>but it is not necessarily better than
    an old design, even for contemporary works.  <BR> <BR>I think new, excellent work
    that that done by some who post on this board, including Nick, is exciting and
    wonderful to have and use.  <BR>But that doesn&#39;t mean that less innovative
    work is less useful or appropriate in many, if not most, contexts.   '

    function are not absolutes, but culturally specific. <BR> <BR>I think it is important
    to express the zeitgeist, but not for reasons to do with historical time. Like
    Tiffany, I am neither for or against tradition or fashion. What concerns me is
    that people today should contribute to their culture in a meaningful way &#40;hopefully
    paid as well&#41;.  <BR> <BR>What I object to is that in many ways Helvetica,
    and the &#34;Adobe Original&#34; are our zeitgeist. The Adobe Original is, with
    perfect Newspeak, a revival. Now matter how &#34;good&#34; such a typeface is,
    it represents the way that trans national corporations have come to dominate the
    cultural landscape, restricting opportunity for content creators. <BR> <BR>Helvetica,
    Adobe Garamond, and Minion are good typefaces, but they would not occupy their
    present position of popularity had their free distribution not been part of a
    strategy used by companies whose primary business is to sell other, more lucrative
    products such as computers, operating systems, and major applications. <BR> <BR>On
    the upside, there is a thriving, diverse industry in script fonts &#40;with a
    growing prosumer market&#41;, and, to a lesser extent, pixel fonts &#40;for Flash&#41;.

    to go for the easy smart remark. Oh well. I was simply trying to point out that

    to license all of the type to which I really would like to have access. I would
    hope that type designers today would want to improve or at least work toward an
    ideal improvement of their own thinking. Why design type if you aren&#39;t trying

  body: These issues go all over the map. Obviously there is need for &#34;good book
    faces&#34;, old, or new. We have an abundance of the rest. <BR> <BR>Still the
    real question remains. What makes for good book design? Is it as Nick suggests,
    type decision, and type decision only. Otherwise he asks, &#34;why not use default
    grids?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;not exact wording, to lazy to find the archives&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Clearly questionable logic. One &#40;1&#41; good book face is more important
    than quantity. The work of Aldus Manutius demonstrates not only one &#40;1&#41;
    good book face, and take further note, in one &#40;1&#41; point size only. Aldus
    Manutius is a name you should all know. <BR> <BR>A good book designer can certainly
    produce beautiful books with &#34;a single type face for their entire working
    career.&#34; <BR> <BR>I say to &#34;those that disbelieve&#34; that they know
    nothing of the history of book design. In fact, contrary to arguments type designers
    offer, just examine the plethora of typographical book design failures in spite
    of &#34;accidental good type face decisions&#34;. <BR> <BR>Type face choice is
    an important ingredient in book design, as is paper, paper size, colours, margins,
    illustrations, text page to sheet size ratios, point size, spacing, line length,
    table of contents, character count, binding etc. etc. <BR> <BR>Easily comparable
    to cooking. Without quality ingredients it is impossible to make the finest of
    foods. However, that said, &#34;a bad chef&#34; can not make a culinary masterpiece
    from the finest of ingredients.  <BR> <BR>The &#34;cook for the book&#34; is the
    designer, not the ink saleman, type salesman or the &#34;green grocer&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>Remember what your mothers said, &#34;too many cooks spoil the broth&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Type design is not the Eiffle Tower of typography. What is so badly needed
    in the type manufacturing industry is a broader appreciation and understanding
    of the industry at large. Navel gazing should be kept to a minimum. <BR> <BR>The
    &#34;type designers and manufacturers of 90,000 digital fonts doe not dictate
    taste&#34;.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Good taste&#34; is a sophistication of refinements.

    above concerning typefaces in use in CH and D in the 50s and 60s. I was there,
    and I assure you that the Swiss, all over their well-ordered country, set plenty
    of Times New Roman better than we were doing in the USA. Ditto for Baskerville,
    Bodoni, Clarendon, and the lovely Diethelm, which we did not have. The output
    of even the smallest regional newspaper and job shop was far superior to our larger
    shops. Furthermore, they did it all with a dozen or so faces compared to our hundreds,
    most of which were just as mindless in metal as the digital of today. FWIW

  body: Paul, <BR>I believe what I said was, &#34;Much of 50&#39;s/60&#39;s Modernism,
    particularly in among the Swiss and German designers. . . &#34; <BR>To me that
    means only the designers who are counted with the modernists and only &#34;much
    of&#34; them, not all of them.  Also, I said &#34;among&#34; not every single
    Helvet or Deutsch citizen. In America during that period &#40;corporate design
    mostly&#41;, plenty of &#34;Standard,&#34; Helvetica, and Univers was set as well
    but less of it as a percentage per printed piece than in CH &#40;mostly in the
    German speaking Cantons&#41;. <BR>   Quality Typography and impeccable craftsmanship
    are legendary Swiss traits whatever the face of choice. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    Nevertheless, it was a monofontistic society as well.&#60;&#60; and I was trying
    to deal with that.

    Are you recommending otherwise? <BR> <BR>Gerald <BR> <BR> <BR>
