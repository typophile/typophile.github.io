  at this though. So, I humbly ask for your help on this one. The Ace Ventura poster,
  more specifically the business card seen prominently on the poster. Here's the image:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ace_3509.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to know the font used for \"Ace Ventura\" or, if not an exact match, something
  that has similar styles for: C, V, N, U, R and A. Most specifically C and R.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
  what is the handwriting style font used for the \"To serve and protect...\" text?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance :D"
