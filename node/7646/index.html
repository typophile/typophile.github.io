  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Is there a digital version of Metro available with the two-storey 'a'? <BR> <BR>I have a few printed samples of the face (One in  a 1962 HMSO Handbook called <i>The Design of Forms in Government Departments</i> and one in <i>20th Century Type Designers</i>) which both show a two-storey 'a'. The only digital version I can find is Linotype's, which has the single-storey 'a', and I can't find any sign of an alternative character. <BR> <BR> <BR>A quick search turned up this thread <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;topic=83&amp;page=12656" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;amp;topic=83&amp;amp;page=12656">http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;amp;topic=83&amp;amp;page=12656</a></a> but the consensus there appears to view the two-storey 'a' as the alternative, rather than the standard. <BR> <BR>Any ideas?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Unless you re-use actual outline data, there can be no legal obstacle to making new glyphs. Ethically, many people will tell you the &quot;Design&quot; belongs to the original creator. Some even extend this to cover non-Latin scripts! To me this holds no water, because abstract things belong to society more than individuals (nothing is created in a vacuum), and the more people end up working on something needed, the more <i>users</i> benefit. <BR> <BR>What I would do however is contact the makers of the original, and tell them of your plans; give them an opportunity to help, or convince you not to do it. But you decide in the end. Also: give proper credit for the original of course - although I guess in this case you'd <i>have</i> to do that to make the result useful! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

I just thought that if the consensus was that ths kind of thing would be ethical, legal and practical, someone who <i>is</i> a type designer might be tempted by the prospect of an interesting and small set of glyphs. Either out of interest or as a commercial project with a potentially reasonable return. (There's one customer here, and it sounds like there might be some more if the interest in Dwiggins' work is anything to go by). This would be much less work than a full character set, and might provide a useful project for an independent designer. <BR>(I wouldn't rule mself out of considering some kind of financial support or partnership for such a project, though). <BR> <BR>I would really like to see someone do justice to the face as a whole, but maybe that's too much to ask - adding the more interesting glyphs to the existing faces seems a more likely prospect. <BR> <BR>BTW, I would agree with Hrant - I don't think this would be seen as <i>modification</i></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, if you view my last post, you'll see that it isn't a modification if you do it right ;-). Anytime you open up an existing font and do anything to it, you ARE modifying it. But making a new font, comprised entirely of new glyphs which could be used together with an old font isn't modifying anything, because you aren't touching the original font data. Thanks for bringing this up though! Metro is a great face.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Japanese version of InDesign has a composite font feature that can enable exactly this sort of thing. Some set of default glyphs in one font are replaced by glyphs from another font. I don't think it enables you to do them as alternates. <BR> <BR>You could also use SING glyphlets to achieve the same thing, including your choice of having them as alternates or as default glyphs. SING is a newish Adobe technology for having standalone glyphs that add on to existing fonts. Again, it was developed primarily for the Japanese market. Currently it's available as a public beta for InDesign CS, but it would be reasonable to expect greater integration in the future. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

It's certainly easy enough to accomplish this in InDesign. <BR> <BR>That's what I would probably do if adding glyphs to the font itself were impossible. Of course, it also depends on just how much you're using Metro. I have trouble trusting search and replace on large projects. <BR> <BR>Check, recheck, and check again.</div>

These things take a lot of time though; at the same time that we want to ree-release old favorites, we also want to keep bringing new fonts to the market (plus all old AND new fonts need to get up to speed on supporting broader character sets, meaning exponentially more glyphs and potential bugs).
