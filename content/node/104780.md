  from the JP version of Disgaea D2.  Just wondering what this font is?  I've also
  seen it in a couple of other video games, as well as a few other places, especially
  the numbers."

    to find?\r\n\r\nI've tried using an image editor and doing numerous amounts of
    editing to try to get \"whatisfont.com\" to ID the font for me, but I get ones
    that are kind of close, but not it (the number \"5\" doesn't match as well as
    the characteristics of the shape of the \"9\" on the left and right hand side
    (how it kinda bulges out.  NOTE I've seen the number \"0\" of this font and the
    left and right sides bulge outwards as well, like the \"9\", and the \"S\" is
    almost like a straight line in the middle portion of the letter, and the \"V\"
    is curved on only the right hand side.\r\nAlso the number \"3\" has the bottom
    part of the number kind of like the \"5\"\r\n\r\nHopefully someone can ID this
    font, whether it's a commercial or a freetype font, but hopefully a commercial
    one is out there somewhere as commercial fonts that you purchase tend to have
    a full character set."
