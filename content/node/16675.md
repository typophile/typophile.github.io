    poor taste around here, but...\r\n\r\nstudents + the letters UNT + jumbo marker/spraycan
    = invitation to vandalise\r\n\r\nIs it possible to expand the 'UNT' abbreviation,
    because it should stop this, it's just that if it's on signs etc., it's much less
    of an open invitation.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to drag Typophile into the gutter. But,
    I'd rather say something now than when it's finished.\r\n\r\nP.S. Hrant... you're
    not from Liverpool are you?!!!"

  body: "Yeah, Duckworth has an unfortunate [but valid] point. \r\n\r\nI may be missing
    something, but what does the UNT and FW actually stand for? If you could drop
    them, leaving just 'artspace', the whole thing would much look better and also
    work nicely as it would feel less cramped and have it's very own 'artspace'.\r\n\r\nP.S
    hrant DOES sound like a scouser....."

  body: "^\r\nI think that\u2019s Hrant\u2019s hillbilly homage to Fort Worth.\r\n\r\nTom,
    that\u2019s Formata SC. I\u2019ve looked at several weights. The light seems to
    have more contrast than I want but I\u2019ve been comparing, and will keep working
    with it.\r\n\r\nSimon, your point is taken, but like all great minds you\u2019re
    not the first to figure this out. Here\u2019s a funny question: when North Texas
    State University changes to the Universtiy of North Texas, what do you do with
    the call letters for the radio station KNTSU? All that is to say, I\u2019m not
    able to vary on the name. Previous version of the mark featured \u201Cartspace\u201C
    more but it was requested that I preserve the name order. Spray away.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you call a Zoroastrian hillbilly? Hellbilly?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hmmm... I like the Formata, but I'm not so sure about the 'artspace' face,
    it looks a bit too old-fashioned, I think because of the curves on the bowls of
    characters. Maybe (I'm guessing this is custom, but there must be something similar...)
    try and find something similar to the one used on the Guardian masthead. It's
    got a nice feel and would complement the Formata.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian\r\n\r\nI
    like White Pepper's idea of leaving the 'artspace' in a space, but I don't think
    those initials would be helped by doing so (might make the UNT thing more noticeable).\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps!\r\n\r\nP.S. Am now disappointed Hrant's not a Scouser..."

  body: "Thanks. Would be nice to be able to start with a rework on the name, but
    that\u2019s not the case. That is Dolly BLD in the middle of the sandwich. I think
    (I'm not the font ID master) that is Oranda BLD in the gaurdian masthead. The
    x-height of Oranda and genes are a great match for Formata. Thanks for the help."

    when I think about it, I did own some Letraset Pantone markers (do they still
    make those crazily expensive felt-tips?) - but they would have been too expensive
    to use, (even if it was only for adding the odd extraneous consonant here and
    there)!"

  body: 'Since the Artspace is in the university you have no need to tell the reader
    they are at the university. You need to define artspace. I would need to know
    if it was a gallery or a dance company or maybe both. I might look at a more "arty"
    treatment of Artspace. Look at some of the U&LC work of Herb Lubalin. It seems
    you are going the easy route and need to do more research and spend less time
    on the computer. '

  body: "OK Dan, that gets the ball rolling. Let me clarify a bit, the gallery is
    not in the university. It is in a medical building in the arts district in a different
    city than the university. Now, as far as defining artspace, I think I know what
    you mean. One issue is that the current show is the first. The space may be used
    for dance. It may have many uses, but what those uses are is an issue for the
    curatorial department of the university. I've said previously in the thread that
    I am confined a bit in what I can do. I've not chosen to show options that have
    been rejected thus far. So here's a bit of context.\r\n\r\nThe original logo design.
    I don't know the designer on this.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Original.gif]\r\n\r\nHere
    is my first proposed rework.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Attempt.gif]\r\n\r\nWithout
    too much detail, I am confined to using the name as it is. Given that I'm not
    going to vary much from the long wordmark, I've arrived where I have.\r\n\r\nOddly
    U&lc has been a favorite. Maybe I have ignored the development in some ways in
    favore of simple, thoughtless computer solutions. I tend to think in this case
    though that I'm not going to change certain imposed limitations. I know I'm dissapointed
    that I've not been able to direct the gallery toward a stronger mark, but I also
    feel I'm improving what exists, and providing some long term free support. I'm
    assembling a small type pool to cover wall labels and other unknown needs. Take
    a look at the attached PDFs to get a larger feel for the direction. I'll attach
    them to the original message."
