body: "<p>If you think that browsers are good for reading blog entries, but lousy
  for writing, raise your hand. Just what I thought. We're all in agreement here.
  The good news is that there is a better way. There are a number of email-like clients
  for writing blogs out there, and it just so happens that they will work with the
  Uppercase blogs. You can also use them to submit news stories. I'm going to quickly
  walk through the set-up process on one of the better clients I've found.</p>\n\n<p>The
  one I'm going to use for this tutorial is <a href=\"http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/ecto2.dmg\"
  title=\"ecto2\">Ecto</a>. It's cross platform, and it's the best I've found so far.</p>\n\n<p>Once
  you have Ecto installed it will ask you to enter some settings for your site.</p>
  \n\n<ol>\n<li>Enter the address of your weblog: http://typophile.com/blog</li>\n<li>System:
  Drupal</li>\n<li>Api: MovableType</li>\n<li>Access Point: http://typophile.com/xmlrpc.php</li>\n<li>Username:
  Your Typophile username</li>\n<li>Password: Your Typophile password</li>\n<li>Account
  Name: Whatever you want to call it</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You should now be able to see
  your blog with any blog posts you've made up to this point</p>\n\n<a href=\"system/files?file=200510220946.jpg\"
  onclick=\"window.open('system/files?file=200510220946.jpg','popup','width=474,height=196,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return
  false\"><img src=\"system/files?file=200510220946-tm.png\" height=\"196\" width=\"473\"
  border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"200510220946\" /></a>\n\n<p>From here,
  to create a new post, just click new, edit, click publish, and there it is, at typophile.com/blog/youruserid,
  or in the mix at typophile.com/uppercaseblogs</p>"

  body: Lame question and I do realize that I sound like those people who are looking
    for a free version of a $19 font. But are there any free blog apps? :^/

  body: From what I've seen, this one is worth the nominal cost, but that doesn't
    mean I didn't look for a free one first :)

  body: I use Ecto for <a href="http://www.typographi.com">Typographica</a>, <a href="http://www.stewf.com">Stewf.com</a>,
    and the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed">FontFeed</a>. It's saved me
    a ton of time and helped me learn a few coding tricks too -- especially when attaching
    images to posts (I presume that function doesn't work on Typophile blog tho).
    I highly recommend it for any MT, Typepad, LiveJournal, Drupal site.

  body: Image upload actually does work for the Uppercase blog. You need to edit the
    upload template to use the [img:sites/default/files/old-images/] tag, but it works.
