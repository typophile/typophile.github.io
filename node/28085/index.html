  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>OK, Dear Typophiles, I decided I can’t delay this any longer. Here is a PDF specimen of the changes I made to ITC Mendoza a couple of years ago, as my first exercise in the use of Fontographer. (I’m now learning FontLab.)</p>
<p>I used the font to set my thesis in phonetics—hence the added <a href="http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/ipachart.html">IPA</a> and mathematical glyphs.</p>
<p>What do you think? Please be honest; I know I have a lot to learn (had even more when doing this). I think it’s best for me not to comment on the details in advance.</p>
<p>The hinting is bad Fog autohinting, so the glyphs may look bad at small sizes on the screen, and even when printed on a laser printer. The thesis was actually output on a Xerox DocuTech (at 600 dpi); it was far from offset quality, but the distortions weren’t as bad as on my Brother laser printer (600 dpi, with resolution enhancement).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance (though it may take a while before I return to work on this font).</p>
<p>Olli</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your modifications look nice. Sometimes great fonts like Mendoza (one of my favorites) lack some attention to detail and flair beyond glyphs that get used 90% of the time (such as your %). I can&rsquo;t speak to the IPA as I&rsquo;m not versed in it, but everything else seems good.</p>
<p>Note: there may be EULA issues with the modification, but I don&rsquo;t know about ITC specifically. Let&rsquo;s not sidetrack the discussion to EULA&rsquo;s, but I did want to mention it.</p>
<p>You might talk to ITC about selling it to them as an extension.</p>
<p>EDIT: I do prefer the original 3. It is very odd I&rsquo;ll admit, but I think it&rsquo;s odd in keeping with the rest of the font. There is unusual tension and weighting throughout. This is, to me, a signature of Mendoza. But maybe too quirky for heavy math. Also, it is customary for the small caps to be slightly larger than the x height. Was this just preference?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you so much, Randy!</p>
<p><cite>Note: there may be EULA issues with the modification</cite></p>
<p>I am aware this. ITC said it&rsquo;s OK for me to use the modified version in keeping with the original license. I hope this EULA issue hasn&rsquo;t scared people away.</p>
<p><cite>You might talk to ITC about selling it to them as an extension.</cite></p>
<p>Oh, it (the IPA) is not good enough for that&ndash;and it&rsquo;s very far from complete, in terms of glyph coverage.</p>
<p><cite>I do prefer the original 3. It is very odd I’ll admit, but I think it’s odd in keeping with the rest of the font.</cite></p>
<p>Yes, my 3 isn&rsquo;t very good, I knew that right away. And later I&rsquo;ve sort of started to like the original, though it still looks too big to me. Perhaps the face is a bit too quirky for a scientific (thought not so math-heavy) text in the first place; but I wanted to give the text a &ldquo;humanist&rdquo; touch.</p>
<p><cite>Also, it is customary for the small caps to be slightly larger than the x height.</cite></p>
<p>I guess it was my preference at the time for the small caps to be the same height as the old-style numerals, i.e. very slightly (about 10/1000 em) taller than the lowercase x height (though part of it was just keeping the SC height as it was). For one thing, taller small caps would&rsquo;ve looked odd in combination with the numerals, as in JH11 (with small caps for JH). I have to admit, though, that the small caps now look a bit small to me in ordinary acronyms.</p>
<p>Any other comments on the small caps?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>RE: Smallcaps
Hard to tell without a text setting, but they look too dark for the regular weight. It looks like you applied an auto <em>bold</em> to them to compensate for the scaling (the right idea, just a little heavy). I say this because it has lost stroke contrast, or sparkle, leaving them a little dull compared to the originals (look at the P for example). Auto bold always does this. It is very very minor in this case.</p>
<p>RE: 3
Yours is very credible. Definitely fits with the set. This is a matter of taste.</p>
<p>BTW, I like the nut fractions!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>About the small caps: I did apply auto bold at one point, but also did a lot of hand editing, esp. of the serifs. This is because I didn&rsquo;t like the original small caps at all: the serifs seemed to me way too weak compared to the stems. (The contrast was larger then in the full caps, and I didn&rsquo;t like that.)</p>
<p>I admit that my small caps look a bit mechanical, lacking grace and refinement. For example, the vertical stems have more or less even widths, whereas they should be a bit thinner at the middle, like in the caps. But as they were only going to be used at text sizes, I left them like that. In fact, given the poor resolution and hinting, it might have better this way.</p>
<p>And yes, the small caps may also be a bit too heavy. I wanted them to have loose spacing, and figured that even color therefore required them to relatively bold.</p>
<p>The italic small caps are a fairly quick addition. I did not spend much time editing them (after the autoslant) because their frequency in the text was very small.</p>
<p><cite>BTW, I like the nut fractions!</cite></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this kind of fractions were called &ldquo;nut&rdquo; fractions! Yeah, for some reason, I wanted to make them like this.</p>
