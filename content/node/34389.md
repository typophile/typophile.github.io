body: "I am having problems with sizes when I am pasting into fontlab. I know there
  is a certain size you should set up your illustrator file, something to do with
  the em square? I couldn't find it in the wiki. Would that be in points? Death to
  inches.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was wondering what common ways of setting up guides were.
  Some people draw straight into fontlab, but I have a shit-ton of guides set up in
  my illustrator file, with layers and such. It doesn't seem to be very efficient,
  or accurate.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input and secret guide techniques.\r\n\r\nTerrance\r\nwww.typeterrance.com"

  body: "Essentially, 1 point in Illustrator = 1 em unit in FontLab. \r\n\r\nNote:
    This is assuming that you leave \"Fit EPS files to (Ascender - Descender) height\"
    unchecked in the FontLab preferences."

  body: In FontLab, draw a line from the cap line to the zero point on the baseline.
    Paste it into Illustrator and it will give you the size you need for the caps.
    Seems like it's about 9.7 inches.

  body: "Thanks guys. That will help.\r\n\r\nI'm working on small caps and alternate
    characters, so I have to look into OpenType stuff too.\r\n\r\nI was using fontographer
    last year, and it just wasn't working. It wouldn't publish my kerning pairs. Do
    you guys use fontographer too? I've heard of people starting there and importing
    it into fontlab.\r\n\r\nMark: Kinescope looks great. It reminds me of the Ray
    Ban lettering. I sent you some photos of Coquette on Target packaging a while
    back. I have to admit, I'm a fan. Matter of fact, I used to live in Minnesota.
    You wouldn't happen to need an intern? j/k"

    also for sending the Coquette sighting and everything. For now, I don't really
    have any need for an intern, much less have room for one. :-)"

  body: How large do you make your Illustrator drawings? As it is easier to adjust
    points when they are large. Currently, I am working with letters maybe an inch
    tall, which is probably WAY too small.

  body: "I went back through my original working files for several of the fonts I've
    done. Each one started at a different size, from less than an inch to several
    inches high. I don't remember any of them giving me trouble as far as drawing
    accurately. Unless you use the arrow keys to nudge points alot, I can't see where
    it would matter in the drawing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, 700 UPM in FontLab =
    700 points in Illustrator, or 9.722 inches. If you know your caps are going to
    be 700 UPM in FontLab, you could begin at that size in Illustrator. Then the glyphs
    paste perfectly into FontLab with no resizing required."

    body: "Yeah, I did run into problems with the arrow keys, but I adjusted the preferences
      to a smaller increment, and that helped.\r\n\r\nI have been messing around with
      sizes, and I concluded on 700 points too.\r\n\r\nThank you for continuing to
