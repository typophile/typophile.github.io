body: "Hi all! \r\n\r\nI'm a new member to this forum, but often come here to look
  at things/derive inspiration. \r\n\r\nI am a GD student at Anderson University in
  Anderson, SC. Our school is very small in terms of students, but the GD program
  is strong and almost always has award winning designers graduating. I am currently
  a sophomore in the program and am absolutely loving it so far!\r\n\r\nThat being
  said, during the past month to a month and a half, we have been given the opportunity
  to design a typeface from scratch - from sketching, to hand rendering, to scanning
  and pathing in Illustrator, to creating an opentype version of the typeface. I've
  put a lot of work into this project, so I guess I just wanted some feedback on it!\r\n\r\nI
  have posted the specimen book on issuu.com, so you can read about the face and the
  concept behind it. \r\n\r\nWithout further ado, I give you all Quest!\r\n\r\n[[http://issuu.com/gagelagreca/docs/quest]\r\n\r\n][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tsp7_6434.png]"

  body: I really like the overall character, but there are some odd pointy bits (the
    tail of the R, or the bottom of the j, for example) and it's not clear if they're
    intentional, or a case of too many splines.
