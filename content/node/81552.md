  describe the form of Galloway and Thacker's book *The Exploit.* Here's a preview:
  http://books.google.com/books?id=_OsaKlegTbcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=galloway+thacker+exploit&hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=7Za1TbjQM8LdgQfD0Km8Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false\r\n\r\nAs
  you'll see (and as they explain in their note \"On Reading This Book\"), the first
  major section has fragments in italics which set off small bits of the text-- they're
  not headings, because they are part of the main text. Is there a typographic term
  for this kind of form? Or can I just call them \"fragments and micro-essays\"? Thanks
  for any help."

  body: I don't think there's an exact term for this. They look a little like pull
    quotes (usually used to mean repeats of a quote in an article printed in large
    type in the margin or text column, which the main text flows around, so not exactly
    the right definition) or block quotes / extracts (still not exactly what you have).
    The term "deck" is also maybe applicable, though, like the other terms, not quite
    right (decks are introductory paragraphs printed in display size or special typeface).
    I might go with "extracts," though as I said, that has a slightly different definition
    of its own.

  body: "Thanks, Joshua Langman. Those terms help a lot, at least as tools for comparison.
    I think you're right that there's not quite an exact term for them, but one can
    certainly work with what you're offering. \r\n\r\n Nick Shinn, not summaries.
    My question was a bit vague, but as JL points out, the main text \"flows around\"
    these italic bits in a way that makes them function differently than summaries
    or superordinate decks."

  body: "They are summaries, at least according to the introduction, which states,
    \"For quick immersion, we suggest skimming Part I by reading the italicized sections
    only.\"\r\n\r\nIsn't that the way summaries work\u2014defined as \u201Ca shortened
    version of a text that highlights its key points\u201D?\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    they could be considered as subheadings, in that they introduce ideas which are
    expounded upon in the immediately following text. Paragraph-length subheadings,
    that is.\r\n\r\nHowever, on a purely typographic reading (disregarding content),
    as there is no variation in the body text, other than style, it is merely <em>emphasis</em>,
    which is generally done by going into italic or bold face, or perhaps a sans.
    It could be compared with a block quote, which is a similar interruption of body
    text. So how about \"block subheading\"?\r\n\r\n"
