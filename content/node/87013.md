body: "I'm adding some glyphs to an existing font and am trying to better undestand
  how the set up of the OTF font effects finding characters in PDF files generated
  by InDesign.\r\n\r\nWhen adding glyphs I use Adobe's list (http://www.adobe.com/devnet-archive/opentype/archives/glyphlist.txt)
  to name the glyphs.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm adding the ae dipthong character with a
  macron (unicode code point 01E3) as well as a the thorn with a cross stroke (unicode
  code point A765). The ae IS in Adobe's list, the thorn is NOT. In my liga feature
  I added the following:\r\n<code> sub f i by fi;\r\n sub Thorn macron by Thornmacron;\r\n
  sub thorn macron by thornmacron;\r\n sub AE macron by AEmacron;\r\n sub ae macron
  by aemacron;</code>\r\n\r\nAs far as I knew this provided everything necessary so
  that when I export from InD to PDF I can search for a regular ae (with no macron)
  or a regular thorn (with no stroke) and my new glyphs will get found as well as
  the \"regular\" ones.\r\n\r\nIf I insert either glyph using the InDesign glyph palette,
  InD inserts them as a single character. If I insert the main character (the ae or
  the thorn WITHOUT the macron/stroke) followed by the macron, InDesign puts in the
  two characters and dutifully uses the glyph as it should.\r\n\r\nWhen searching
  an exported PDF, however, ALL the occurances of ae are found regardless of how they
  were inserted, but the thorn characters that were inserted by using the glyph palette
  (and are a single glyph in InD) are NOT found. Only the \"regular\" thorns (with
  no cross stroke) and the ones that are in InD as two characters are found.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know whether this is because InD and possibly Acrobat don't \"know\" what
  the thorn with the stroke because it's not in Adobe's list? Other than being from
  two different unicode sets, I don't why there would be a difference with the ae
  versus the thorn.\r\n\r\nThanks for any insight anyone can offer and thanks for
  reading a marathon post!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nKen"

    and has nothing to do with the font??\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nKen"

  body: "You're glyph names aren't valid. You should use the following:\r\n\r\nsub
    Thorn macron by uniA764;\r\nsub thorn macron by uniA765;\r\nsub AE macron by uni01E2;\r\nsub
    ae macron by uni01E3;\r\n\r\nIf you export a .pdf file from InDesign, the unicode
    values will be embedded, so it will be searching for those. When you insert your
    Thornmacron character from the glyph palette, you're giving it something which
    has no unicode value and to which it cannot assign one since it doesn't have a
    meaningful name. If you had named it either Thorn_uni0304 or uni00DE0304 you might
    have better luck since these names are at least interpretable.\r\n\r\nWhether
    a program will find (e.g.) eogonek when searching for e will depend entirely on
    how unicode savvy the program is. Some programs will decompose eogonek into e
    + uni0328 when searching. Others won't.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Just two quick additional notes:\r\n\r\nFirst, I'd put these sorts of substitutions
    (minus the f i) in the ccmp feature rather than the liga feature -- that is, after
    all, what it is for.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're going to allow your thorn with stroke
    character to be entered as a sequence, I wouldn't use the combining macron character.
    I'd instead use uni0335 or uni0337, neither of which is entirely appropriate but
    either of which is a better choice than uni0304. The macron sits above the character
    whereas the other two intersect it.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Still using the macron I tried straight unicode names (uniA765) as well as
    combination names (uni00FE00AF), niether of which InD/Acrobat decomposed as they
    weren't found by searching or the thorn.\r\n\r\nI also tried various combinations
    using the stroke character (uni0335) named per Adobe's glyph list but was still
    unable to find the new stroked character searching for the non-stroked one.\r\n\r\nYes,
    \"Ignore Diacritics and Accents\" was on, I think it is on by default.\r\n\r\nMy
    concern is that when this material/fonts go to the web and will be in need of
    being searched. As ther is not yet a concrete plan of what the web end of things
    will entail, I guess I'll just stick with the recommended naming conventions and
    hope for the best!\r\n\r\nAny other info would be welcome and I'll be sure to
    post back if I come up with any revallations.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the input

  body: "Part of the problem may be that Latin Extended D is relatively new and not
    all software might support it. As a name, uni00FE00AF is less than ideal since
    u00AF isn't a combining mark but a spacing character. Acrobat's 'ignore diacritics'
    might not view slashed thorn as a thorn plus a diacritic since it's really a scribal
    abbreviation rather than an accented character.\r\n\r\nIf you need to be able
    to search for these, I'd just make sure to enter the character as a two character
    sequence in InDesign (Thorn + uni0304 or uni0335 or whatever you choose) since
    ID will then preserve the two unicode values in your exported .pdf.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Am I right in thinking that the dlig would pretty much end up working like
    the liga or ccmp, where the characters would be inserted seperately? In that case
    I think I'd prefer the more basic liga or ccmp, simple concepts for my simply
    mind, which is quickly turning to mush under the weight of Opentype features!
    :o)\r\n\r\nWell, I'm now convinced (mostly) that it is simply the unicode characters
    recognized by either InD, Acrobat or both. In the font there are glyphs that were
    not in any kind of substitution feature, nor were they even named according to
    Adobe's list yet searching for the plain character found the accented character.
    A G with an overdot (unicode 0120) is one example. That seems to indicate that
    the a substitution table isn't necessary for this type of searching. Something
    I'd love confirmed if anyone can do so.\r\n\r\nI think I'll take Andr\xE9's good
    advice and add the short stroke and name the thorn glyph using the two unicode
    values that comprise it. I'm guessing that other search engines may have the best
    shot at decomping it when the time comes.\r\n\r\nThanks again for everyone's time.
    This forum is da' bomb (sorry, its late).\r\n\r\nAll best,\r\nKen"

  body: "The behaviour will be determined by the rule type you use; the choice of
    feature differs in the following way:\r\n\r\nliga = standard ligatures, which
    in most applications will be turned on be default.\r\ndlig = discretionary ligatures,
    which will generally be turned off unless the user turns it on.\r\nccmp = unicode
    composition, which will be turned on by default and generally cannot be turned
    off by the user.\r\n\r\nSo which of these you should use will really depend on
    what you want the default behaviour to be. If you're using thorn + stroke (uni0335)
    then ccmp would probably be the best choice, though liga would also work.\r\n\r\nIf
    you went with my second suggestion of a three-character combination (thorn_ae_t)
    then dlig would be the best choice (the use of barred thorn as an abbreviation
    for <em> \xFE\xE6t</em> is the only usage I'm familiar with -- if it has other
    uses this choice would be less than optimal).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
