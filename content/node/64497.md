    and it being an old sign I'd be willing to bet it's hand painted."

    brass or pot metal that used to be available in hardware shops in the 1950s. People
    would just walk into a shop and pick out numbers from a bin.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Yeah, the 7 in Goudy Forum is similar, but not the 5. In fact, matching the
    7 is not the hardest part. (Worcester, Serlio, Poor Richard, University Roman,
    to name a few, have a similar 7). Finding a 5 to go with the 7 seems to be the
    challenge.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "My take is that those are allowances for casting but to a larger extent,
    a place to put the nail behind it. If you think of the crudeness of the technology,
    you realize that this was not about matching the purity of a typeface but making
    a cheap and fast product that would survive the production process with few \"throw
    aways\" and function as something that could be nailed on a door--like a tapered
    horseshoe nail.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    We are so spoiled today with a pop-up menu containing 1000 fonts that we forget
    what the world was like in the 19th century when the technology used to make the
    above door signs came about. Everything was done by hand and reproduced with crude
    molds.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
