body: "I've been improving with the Fontlab learning curve, and have encountered some
  issues/questions along the way. These questions might expose my inefficient amateur
  workflow, so I welcome any suggestions. Especially now, before I get too stuck in
  my wrong ways. Since I won't bother to bombard the board with multiple posts, I'll
  just list them out here:\r\n\r\n1. If I move the anchor of, let's say e, how can
  I get it to automatically update the positioning of \xE9 without deleting the glyph
  (slot still there, but cleared) and double-clicking it again? Also, when I try this
  with a character that doesn't exist in the current codepage, it deletes the entire
  glyph and I have to generate it. Any shortcut to that? \r\n\r\n2. Is there any way
  I can sort my glyphs so that scaron, scommaaccent, sacute, etc are next to each
  other?\r\n\r\n3. If I kern Nu, can I apply the kerning value automatically to N\xFA,
  N\xF9, N\xFB etc? If the answer's kerning classes, will I end up making a class
  for each base composite? \r\n\r\n4. With a few hundred glyphs, is there anyway to
  quickly check if all my contours are in the right direction?\r\n\r\n5. How come
  I must decompose each glyph and merge the contours before I generate a font? Why
  would anyone want to NOT merge/decompose? I'm curious.\r\n\r\n6. Is there an automatic
  centering feature? e.g. Placing an anchor exactly in the horizontal center of an
  O without checking with rulers each time.\r\n\r\n7. What does it mean when a glyph
  slot is bright red?\r\n\r\nHope that's not too overwhelming. Feel free to answer
  one or just some, I need all the help I can get. Thanks in advance!"

    use index mode in the glyph window or create an encoding file that orders things

    Yes you have to make a class for each key glyph.\r\n4. Select everything in the
    font window (cmd+a) and run Contour >> Paths >> Set PS Direction. This might break
    a few glyphs if you have stuff running in too many directions, but usually it
    works fine.\r\n5. If you don\u2019t remove overlaps glyphs some programs will
    render the overlaps incorrectly. Likewise, not all software handles composites

    that you ran some kind of batch function on a bunch of glyphs and it failed on
    that one, marking it as red. If you got a VFB file from someone else, that designer
    may have marked it red as a reminder."

    using anchors is to be able to preview the position of accents before you build
    the composites. At least that is the way I use them (when I use them). Isn't that
    the reason the Anchors Preview is there in the Preview Window?"

    the my question #5. Let me rephrase. Since it's obviously better/safer to decompose+merge

    upon generation? Is there any circumstance where one would NOT want to decompose
    and merge?\r\n"

  body: "<em>Is there any circumstance where one would NOT want to decompose and merge?</em>\r\n\r\nFor
    fonts with TrueType outlines, it's not necessary to decompose composites in the
    final fonts. It may actually be desireable to keep accented glyphs as components
    because that way you only have to hint the accent and base glyph once and can
    use additional hinting in the composite glyph e.g. to keep the base glyph and
    accent from touching. If you decompose, these stacked hints would break.\r\n\r\nTo
    be on the safe side, don't use scaled or flipped components if you plan to keep
    composites in your fonts."

    making. I generate a *lot* of test fonts in the design/developing phase; and say
    an f_f_itilde ligature is a pain to tweak again once it's decomposed and merged.
    Or an oslash\u2026 :-\\\r\nSo I for one wouldn't find it funny if FontLab decomposed
    and merged my stuff every time I generate a font. But maybe everyone else does
    it differently :-?"

  body: "Ad 7. If you're asking about the caption of a glyph cell being bright red,
    it means that you have a mismatch between the glyphname and the Unicode codepoint.
    \r\n\r\nRegarding decomposing and merging: FontLab Studio doesn't automatically
    remove overlaps because it is not always a perfectly precise operation. Sometimes,
    when you have complex shapes that overlap, there may be some manual clean up work
    required. However, there is a setting in Preferences to automatically decompose
    all glyphs when the font is generated as OpenType PS (.otf). It's a good idea
    to always decompose all glyphs (even the non-overlapping ones) in OTF, since composites
    in OTF are considered an \"obsolete feature\" and some rasterizers (e.g. Bitstream
    FontFusion) don't render them correctly. On the other hand, for OpenType TT /
    TrueType fonts, it's a good idea to keep the non-overlapping composites because
    the hinting is simpler and more consistent in the final font. With composite glyphs,
    FontLab Studio only needs to generate TT hinting code for the base glyphs and
    there are far less situations when the accented letter would render differently
    from the base letter. If you decompose glyphs in a TT font, some letters may render
    differently, and your font will be considerably larger. \r\n\r\nOverlapping contours,
    however, should be always decomposed and merged. If they're not, Mac OS X will
    render them so that the overlaps become visible. This is for example visible in
    Arial or Times New Roman on Mac OS X, for glyphs such as aogonek \u2014 you can
    actually see a thin white outline around the ogonek that protrudes into the \"a\".
    And yes, Ben Kiel's Python script for generating fonts is doing all the steps
    you're asking for at once. \r\n\r\nRegarding the encoding files \u2014 there is
    a section in the manual that discusses this, and you just need to follow it. An
    encoding file is a plain text file in which the first line has a special format
    that includes an encoding number (random) plus a name, while the subsequent lines
    are just glyphnames, one per each line, in the order that you desire. Once you
    put the .enc file in the right location, start FLS and switch your font to that
    encoding, you'll be able to use Glyph / Sort Glyphs / By Encoding to get the desired
    glyph order in your font. \r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
