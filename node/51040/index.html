  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hey all. i've been working on this for awhile, would love to get some of your feedback on what i have so far. i still have to do lowercase, but the main idea of the uppercase is done. see any problems? this is my first typeface, so any help is greatly appreciated. i am currently working on tweaking each form.

thanks!

O, Q, and D look too similar. N looks dark (maybe widen it?) W looks bottom-heavy. Top counter of A is probably too slight.

It definitely has a nice personality.

The only nitpik that I have is that there is some inconsistency with how the edges of the counters are treated. Some are rigid and straight, some are bowed in, and some (like on the B) are a mix. I'm not saying that's good or bad...just that it's something that seems to stick out.

I agree with cuttlefish and eliason's comments as well. Do more with the Q and maybe vary a few of the others. The C might not need such large stems on the open side.</div>

that's exactly what i was looking for.

here are a few tweaks, taking in some of your suggestions. i have tried adding some small ink traps inthe tight angles (N, M, K) but i just haven't come up with anything that seems to work.

i also haven't really been able to come up with any ideas on how to make the O, D, and Q vary more. any thoughts there?

thanks again

I would look at the letter that have diagonals coming into those seriffy nubs - I think you should reduce the size or otherwise knock back the obviousness of those nubs (I'm looking at the top of A and bottom of W). The greater change of direction resulting from the diagonal makes them too prominent compared to the ones on the vertical strokes.</div>

i added a bit to the tail of the Q, played around a diagonal 4, adjusted the top of the R, and made some minor refinements to the A, V, W and a few others.

I think the E could be a bit narrower (compare with the H) and the hood of the G could be longer (more down). Can the top of the A be opened wider so the sides are not vertical but less white space around them? I think I'd move the knee of the R down a bit and bring the top of the leg out away from the stem slightly.
hope that's helpful ;)</div>

% might be a little light.
Slashes are heavy.
Asterisk looks heavy or perhaps just big.

Definitely explore other ampersands. Something with an open top and closed bottom, maybe with a diagonal element. Or something like the dollar sign with a shortened backwards 3 in the middle.</div>

i changed the @, made a new &, fixed all the slashes (which i just realized you can't see in this gif, and made the asterisk a bit smaller (still might be a bit big?)

also, still not sure if i'm completely satisfied with the @.

overall i'm really liking it at this point though. notice anything else that bothers you ?

thanks so much !

I think I preferred the previous @. Yes, I think * could still be reduced.

The bottom two strokes of the 2 look heavy to me.
Is the middle of 2 and S truly horizontal? I suspect it is, but it appears "overtorqued" as an optical illusion from the treatment of the corners, etc. I'd be curious to see what those glyphs would look like if you rotated the center to get an optical horizontal. 

Another thing you could consider would be redrawing the 2 with a diagonal (so the bottom is more like Z).

VERY interesting point on the "overtorqued" middle. i actually had not noticed that at all, but now that you've pointed it out it's obvious. i'm gonna try tweaking that.

i originally did draw a diagonal 2, but i just didn't like how it looked. i might give it another go, though.

thanks for the help, again!
