  terms of course) but hours of searching on auction-sites didn't bring up anything
  better.\r\nobviously WTF didn't succeed in suggesting anything remotely close.\r\n\r\nexamples
  are from two different generic album-styles (one originally blue on silver/white
  the other white on black) - i do however think it is the same font.\r\n\r\ni pin-pointed
  to some of the features that might set this font apart:\r\nG - missing horizontal
  bar\r\n\xC9 - shrunk size\r\nQ - tail cutting through\r\na - fits more into serif
  font scheme\r\nW - wide angle\r\n165 - e.g. 5 leaning to the right a bit (i couldn't
  find a set of numbers in my fonts that has a consistent look)\r\n\r\n(missing samples
  would be D J X Z)\r\n\r\nthx[img:sites/default/files/old-images/123_5505.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/456_6707.jpg]"

    Identifont did not create a page tagging fonts with a _G_ that has no bar.\r\nDon"

  body: "hello don!\r\n\r\ntelling from the logo (not depicted here) i can say that
    this doesn't come from any of the european columbia(s) but in fact from columbia
    phonograph u.s.\r\n\r\ni am aware of the identifont tools. in this case unfortunately
    they were not too helpful for the obvious reasons. this is basically about FONT
    RECOGNITION - in the sense that somebody has actually come across this font before
    and remembers; strongest clue being the G\r\n\r\nit has to be something no later
    than '38 when columbia u.s. was bought by CBS; and upon researching a bit i can
    give 1931 for the recording date of the gieseking; the album style (\"royal blue\")
    is 1932-1935!"

  body: "Based on your update which provides a case that this is indeed an American
    typeface from the pre-phototypesetting era, I might suggest that somebody go through
    \ Mac McGrew's  _American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century_ http://www.amazon.com/American-Typefaces-Twentieth-Century-Revised/dp/0938768395
    and do a page by page visual comparison. Not a five minute task. However, if it
    yields a match, it would give you a complete character set for the font, which
    could be used to adapt a contemporary digital font.\r\nDon"
