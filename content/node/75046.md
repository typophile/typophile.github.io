  ID this font?\r\nThe caps look like Trajan, but they come with lowercase too.\r\nIt's
  not La Gioconda for sure, but I have no idea what this is.\r\nAdditionally, tell
  me whatever font you know that the caps are strictly based on Trajan's and comes
  with lowercases.\r\n(such as La Gioconda, Capitolium...)"

  body: "<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/monkton/\">Monkton</a> is close,
    but the serifs are off. \"Byington\" is Ray Larabie's version of Trajan with l.c.,
    but it's also not a match.\r\n\r\nMy <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php>Serif
    Guide</a> is not working for me, or that would be a good place to find this.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Both of you, thank you very much for suggestion. At least I could confirm
    who made this.\r\nAnd I didn't know that such a nunmer of Trajans exsist as digital
    font.\r\nMaybe Adobe Trajan is too famous.\r\n\r\nOther font I found is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/amor/|Amors
    Serif]]. Interestingly, it includes sanserif variants."
