body: "Albia Nova is a bit of a new departure for Greater Albion-an unashamedly futuristic
  typeface.  It was originally developed for a friend of ours-a set designed who needed
  some lettering on props for a science fiction play-the brief was to evolve conventional
  letter forms and speculate as to what they may look like in the future.  As released
  Albia Nova is a more refined version of this idea, placing a bit more emphasis on
  readability (today) over evolution of the letterforms.  The result is good for giving
  design projects a futuristic feel, but also has something of the 1970s and 1980s
  about it.\r\n\r\nAlbiaNova has released on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/albia-nova/
  \ | Myfonts]] at a 40% introductory discount.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlbiaNova_5921.png]"
