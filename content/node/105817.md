  gift.\r\n\r\nUnless it's all an act and there's an actual design firm that's going
  to save the day at the very last second (not that all design firms are capable of
  such a feat) Yahoo seems to be in the process of shooting itself in the foot:\r\nhttp://www.yahoo.com/dailylogo\r\n\r\nAlthough
  some people will see the following suggestion as even worse than so-called \"spec
  work\", if we concede that Yahoo is unlikely to abort this ridiculous headless-chicken-in-quicksand
  approach, then maybe we can help them see the light by arriving at a logo that the
  design field will end up supporting as a positive example.\r\n\r\nSo, here goes
  another trademark crazy idea:\r\nSince it's too much to expect somebody making such
  an effort from scratch, start with any of the half-baked (or just plain inedible)
  logos above, make it good, and send it as a gift to Yahoo. FWIW the one, and only
  one, I personally think has great potential is the one for day four:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yahoo_day4_4786.jpg]\r\n\r\nBTW
  anybody with connections at Yahoo is kindly asked to point them in this direction.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I agree that this "daily logo" stuff they're doing is pretty bad, but it's just
    a gimmick. They undoubtedly picked the new logo weeks ago and the new letterheads,
    brochures, signage, etc. are already being made.

    done by an outside agency, since the in-house staff probably has their hands full
    with routine work. \r\n\r\nIf it is an outside agency, they may have no control
    over the gimmick, which I agree that many designers wouldn't want to be associated
    with. For example maybe a design firm is doing their logo, but their ad agency
    or internal group is doing the \"logo a day\" stuff."

    30 days they will have a competently designed logo up their sleeves that they
    spent real money to get a competent designer to create."

    However, instead, I have to admit I don't like it either.\r\n\r\nI have nothing
    against Optima; it's a good text face, even if the light weight used isn't bold
    enough for a logo. But whatever it is, I had to examine the logo carefully to
    determine that the first and last letters were larger, with the three middle ones
    the same size. At first I thought the first letter was large, and then the remaining
    letters gradually increased in size.\r\n\r\nWhen a point like this is ambiguous,
    something is wrong."

  body: "> Or a CEO who's really into micromanaging.\r\n\r\nYep. There are examples
    of employees doing things behind the micromanaging boss' back because they couldn't
    win an argument with him. At Apple the engineers would occasionally change technical
    details without Steve Job's knowledge because they knew he was wrong. And when
    Frank Lloyd Wright designed his masterpiece house Fallingwater, they couldn't
    convince him it needed more reinforcements so they added them secretly. But of
    course you can't make secret changes with logos; what you see is what you get.\r\n\r\nTrying
    to design with the client (or CEO) looking over your shoulder is usually a recipe
    for disaster. They end up designing it themselves (\"make it bigger, now change
    it to blue...\"), instead of letting the designers go through the normal design
    process (which can seem slow and boring to a non-designer)."
