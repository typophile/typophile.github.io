    example when it helps overcome the arbitrary vertical orientation difference between
    opening and closing quotes. Here's an example of what I call \"rationalist quotes\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dahlia_6576.jpg]\r\n_\r\nThis
    style of quotes became popular in the early 20th century (although the above newspaper
    reproduction is from the 1940s) but for some reason it has since dropped out of
    style. Style. Substance? Bah.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The trouble with this kind of quotes from a modern text processing perspective
    is that the opening quote would most likely be encoded as U+2018. So this form
    -- in which U+2018 is the opening quote and the relationship to the closing quote
    is mirrored rather than rotated -- is fine so long as you're dealing with English
    quote conventions. But U+2018 is the \u201Aclosing\u2018 quote in German text,
    and there have been some very grumpy comments from Germans about fonts which use
    the mirrored form for U+2018."
