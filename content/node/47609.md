body: "Hey I'm a graphic designer with my first real freelance job and I'm looking
  for a printer who specializes in printing mailing labels. The thing is the client
  doesn't want them on a roll, he wants them die cut on a full sheet so he can print
  the mailing addresses on with his home laser printer. should I just spec full sheet
  label paper with die cuts or do printers have access to precut stock? I don't know
  these things. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a suggestion for a good printer or a place
  I can find a list of printers? they need not be local so I'm not concerned about
  where it is, as long as it's in the US."

  body: "Hey Elle, I'm a recently graduated student as-well. I found the best way
    to seek out good printers was to simply ask my tutors in college, they are probably
    from your area and will already have a personal relationship built up with a particular
    printer. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to your printing specs just ask the printer! On
    my first real job I talked to a good 5 printers and each time I grilled them for
    information. Not just about my upcoming project but anything that came to mind.
    They should be more then happy to help and answer all your questions. "

    count on them to do a color match to an existing line, but they could be an option."
