  body: "I have to agree with David that satya.com is a good idea. URLs should be
    direct and simple. I sort of like satyapography.in, but I think that complex wordplays
    have no real place in URLs, they just end up being to confusing. Peoples' minds
    will revert to the real words, and then they will type in satyatypography.in instead,
    and then be angry when the URL doesn't work.\r\n\r\nAlthough, I actually sort
    of like satyatype.in and satya-type.in\u2026\r\n\r\nteafortype.com is really cute,
    but it sounds a bit too parlor type\u2026\r\n\r\ntypeindia.in is actually really
    good, but would be a better URL for an India-wide typographic portal than a personal
    website."

    people who enter in your URL thinking it has a .com address will be redirected.
    It helps people find you better.

  body: agree with Goran, you will eventually get bored of weird, funny addresses
    and you'll wish you had adopted a simple and short name instead. Plus Satya is
    a beautiful name, I don't know if it's a common name in India but from here it
    sounds sexy and exotic.
