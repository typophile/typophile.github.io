  give me the painfully obvious solution. Gosh do I feel stoopid.\r\n\r\nI make a
  new document in Adobe Photoshop CS1 440x110px 72ppi white background and try to
  input Lucida Grande 9 pt in black but <em>nothing happens!?</em>. The infuriating
  thing is that in the Layer palette I see what I've typed (the name \"Layer 1\" changes
  to whatever I typed).\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong? :^("

    you made sure the font you want is loaded?\r\nCan you type anything - highlight
    it after it is typed and then...put it in the face and color you want?\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck. Hope it works out."

    forehead) :^D\r\n\r\nI'm in the T, I tried loads of fonts -- system ones and fonts
    loaded in FontExplorer -- and when I type there's nothing to highlight because
    there's no characters appearing. That's what I don't get -- I've done this loads
    of times so I can't imagine what I'm doing wrong.\r\n\r\nDang I need to get this
    tutorial online!"

  body: "OK Now I opened the <em>Character</em> and <em>Paragraph</em> palettes and
    there was one totally insane number (something like --237658) in the following
    fields: <em>Leading, Baseline Shift, Left Indent, Right Indent, First Line Indent,
    Space Before Paragraph</em> and <em>Space After Paragraph.</em> When I started
    turning this number to 0 in all these fields at some point the text appeared;
    I think it was when I turned <em>Left Indent</em> to zero.\r\n\r\nI think this
    is a bug. I think it's good I've encountered and solved this problem (see Lari's
    comment). Let's pass this information on to other people."

  body: Are you running Photoshop CS2 on an intel Mac and/or are you running 10.4
    with all the latest patches? There are some nasty number bugs like this when running
    CS2 apps on intel Mac as well as some funkiness with the 10.4.8 patches. I constantly
    see my 9 point fonts going to 8.xxxxxxxx... in indesign, it's extremely irritating.
    If you're on a intel mac, try switching to the Photoshop CS3 beta, it's a much
    better piece of software.

    too soon. Keep doubling...\r\n\r\nExcept for the double minus sign (which is just
    plain weird), it looks like -2147483648, which is the smallest value that a signed
