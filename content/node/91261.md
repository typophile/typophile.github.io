  a part of the community.\r\n\r\nI've been asked to lead a redesign of a tabloid
  my company publishes weekly. The goal of the redesign is to celebrate the weekly's
  fifth year by helping it \"grow up\" a bit by applying a modern, mature design that
  still appeals to our 25-35 yr old demographic. I've been asked to have the design
  reflect the look of a magazine more than a newspaper, and so far I've decided that
  Acta Display will be our serif headline font (most likely predominantly in its Black
  weight). \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone might recommend a sans serif font that
  would pair nicely with Acta Display. So far we've looked at Neutraface No. 2 and
  Gotham, but we want to have a few more to choose from before we finalize the font.
  I'm specifically looking for a font that has some condensed options as well, but
  that's not absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be amazing, thank
  you for your help!\r\n\r\nThe link to Acta Display: http://dstype.com/typeface/acta-display"

    body: Sorry, no. The sans serif would be for subheds, sidebars, pull quotes etc.
      The reason we're going with Acta is to help the weekly look a little older.
      The publication is a feature-focused weekly that highlights the city by offering
      a bit of local news, reviewing local restaurants, bars, art shows, etc., reviewing
      films, and showcasing different feature-worthy stories in the area. There's
      an event listing in the back that we're most noted for. The content is fairly
      consistent with others in its class. Hope that helps!

  body: "Not sure I can help you too much -- if it were me, I'd use Charis for the
    text -- is open source, and free. Charis will mix with Acto display better that
    either Minion or H&FJ IMHO. It is not condensed, but is heavy enough that you
    can set it at a bit smaller size. It's the font I go to when I have to get a 3,000
    character book page (hard to do with a 6x9 trim), for either the social sciences
    or contemporary information with a hint of formality, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Chairs,\"
    BTW, is the open source version of Matthew Carter's \"Charter.\" There is very
    little difference in the design. \r\n\r\nAnd take a good look at Lato (also open
    source and free) for the sans. Perhaps not as good for your purposes as Nick's
    types.\r\n\r\nHowever, both of these fonts need work to be first rate. I have
    reworked the Charis, and in principle would be happy to give it to you. It now
    has old-style numbers and formal small caps, fractions, true superiors -- all
    the things one needs for bookwork. And fairly good kerning.\r\n\r\nI haven't done
    as much with Lato yet, old style numbers for the regular & italic, and small caps.
    No kerning beyond the release font yet.\r\n\r\nBut we're talking \"what ifs\"
    before you even look. Lato is an original design, that does mix well with Charis.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.latofonts.com/\r\n\r\nAnd
    another site from our own Typophile, though the italics have been improve from
    what's shown here -- some of the criticisms addressed:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/77283\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, Charter was done by Matthew at Bitstream; Bitstream made the fonts public
    domain, but iiRC, they may not be called \"Charter.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the library,
    I'm just teasing you. I'm not sure the book would be worth whatever they're going
    to charge. Just like a lot of fonts...  As far as libraries go, my wife & I give
    money to a couple libraries here. They're good things. \r\n\r\nI do get exasperated
    at font publishers who, after I've paid them for their work, try to prevent me
    from doing mine. You're not one who proscribes modification for one's own use,
    are you? Forcing someone to do the modifications in InDesign for each use rather
    than once with FontLab? That's one reason I like Open Source fonts.\r\n\r\nBut
    I don't really have a penchant for free fonts, I've just gotten older, and gotten
    tired of beating my head against the wall. So many people -- including most of
    my customers at academic presses -- claim they don't have the budget to buy fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    have somewhat successfully pushed a few for-pay fonts, Sumner Stone's Cycles in
    the repro days, Christobal Henestrosa's Espinova Nova, and I'm going to give a
    try with Ross Mill's Huronia.\r\n\r\nI usually have to offer someone a free design
    to let me \"try\" the fonts; then sometimes the publisher's designers wind up
    liking them enough to buy them for other work -- if they can get it in the budget.
    Which means any other typesetter they use has to buy them too; maybe the the printer
    (depending on the license)  -- each press I can convince results in 2-3- more
    sales.\r\n\r\nHuronia is going to be hard. Not because the fonts aren't good,
    but the package is just expensive in terms of total dollars committed.\r\n\r\nI've
    said it before, but what I'd really like to see is a pretty cheap \"use\" fee
    coupled with a cheap initial purchase fee. Something like $10 to buy the font,
    and $5.00 more each time the font is used. That would seem cheap to the presses
    for bookwork. For the font designer, if a typical font is used for 5 books, they
    would get $35, about what they get now for an outright purchase, IF they can make
    the sale. Or whatever the money works out to in this inflated economy. But if
    you set it much higher, no one will take the risk. And the font customer should
    have the option to purchase unlimited use, on par with today's pricing -- for
    magazines, journals, newspapers...\r\n\r\nWell, no one wants to hear this."

    \r\n\r\nI don't believe anyone said it was. If I did, though, that's bad wording
    on my part.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand: If I gave you two printed pages, set text
    size, one in each of Charter and Charis (adjusted for slightly different sizing),
    do you think you could tell the difference? Esp. if it wasn't a side-by-side comparison,

    you're being shown? I kinda doubt it."
