  bottle stoppers that I bought for our wedding(they come in a Times New Roman looking
  thing too). The \"S\" is the letter that I can't seem to match up. My print shop
  can't figure out what font it is. I want to use the letters as our monogram. Can
  anyone identify the font? Here's a link to look at it.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.tartburners.com/mudpieinhobo.html]]\r\n\r\nIt
  is not Chopin or Brock, but other than that, I am clueless. This is my first post
  here and I have heard great things about the peeps on this site.\r\nThanks so much!

    font. The curlicues have the look of add-ons to me, particularly on the A and
    G. The S you mentioned wasn't shown on that site was it?\r\n\r\nMy suggestion
    is to look for other ornate script fonts and pick something that you like the
    look of. There are samples of many such scripts in [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script13Pg1.html|Part
    13 of my Script Font ID Guide]]. Looking through these you can see that none is
    close to the letters shown on the site samples. Canada Type's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/sterling-script/|Sterling
    Script]] has swash alternates that seem similar in style to your requested look.\r\n\r\n

  body: "The problem with Sterling Script, and a lot of the other fonts, is that the
    \"S\" looks like a T or an L.  I would like an ornate font where the S is clearly
    distinguishable as an S.  Any other fonts that you can think of that would be
    close?\r\nThanks!"
