  href=\"http://wordle.net/create\">Wordle</a> (no, not worlde) is has a pretty impressive
  world cloud generator. It's not quite a tag cloud, as that would imply that it's
  linked to content somewhere, but the visual algorithms are pretty cool.\r\n\r\n(Lastly,
  I can't vouch for the source of the fonts in use - there are a half dozen to choose
  from. They're not font names I readily recognize.)"

    then I wondered what I was doing editing a tag cloud anyway. '
