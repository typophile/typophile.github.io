  <BR> <BR>Perhaps someone can point out the source for the type on this album cover,
  designed by <a href="http://www.jutojo.de/" target="_blank"> Jutojo</a>. <BR> <BR>It
  looks familiar, perhaps I saw it in a book, but I can&#39;t quite place the book.
  It looks like a typeface from the 19th century, &#40;Midolle, Silvestre or Klimsch&#41;.
  A &#34;Dover&#34; book perhaps? Any information would be appreciated.

  body: It looks more engraved to me. The lines are too uneven, too &#34;undigitally&#34;
    rough; but it could very well be Illustrator. Thanks bj.

    not digitized&#41;. However, you&#39;ve all been lucky enough to see BJ in action
    now. Maybe you want some freelance work? This is pretty &#40;sorta kinda&#41;

  body: Great work BJ! Thanks for taking the time.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps someone would
    be able to point out some specimens. I have a few pages copied from the &#34;Florid
    and Unusual Alphabets&#34; from Dover. It has some faces that are similarly dimensional
    and engraved, but I&#39;m not sure it has any scripts like this.

    60&#39;s/early 70&#39;s &#40;not a Dover book&#41;. I wish I could remember the
    name. I used it on my first poster 14 years ago so I recognized it immediately.
