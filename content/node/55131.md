  to jump on the Gotham bandwagon and use it for an up coming project. However, whenever
  I buy a family of faces, I like to make sure I'll have future uses for them. Having
  said that, I was originally drawn to the regular width of Gotham and think it's
  perfect for a direct mail piece I'm designing. However, a lot of my other work is
  divvied up between brochures and newsletters and wondered if the Gotham Narrow family
  would give me more \"bang for the buck.\" After printing some samples, I'm thinking
  some of the appeal of Gotham is lost in the narrow version of the font.\r\n\r\nSo,
  I appreciate the text uses for narrow and would probably get more use out of it,
  but am torn between the two weights.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Thanks!\r\n\r\n"

    However it does set very wide and that is part of it's charm, but it does work
    well in publications. I don't miss the narrow myself.

  body: I think if you license all widths of Gotham you don't need Gotham Narrow.
    I think having the regular width and the extra narrow width is good enough. But,
    on the other hand. If it is a choice between the regular width and narrow then
    you might like the narrow width because it maintains some of the roundness.
