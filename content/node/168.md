body: Hello there.  New to the board.  Would love to get some last minute feedback
  from you folks.   <BR> <BR>This is going to print in various forms on Monday.  Any
  last minute adjustments would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>I have some thoughts
  but I don&#39;t want to bias your replies.  Looking for thoughts on kerning, letterforms,
  serif treatment, overall aesthetic. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10892.gif"

  body: With the unique qualities found in the larger, wedge serifs, perhaps you should
    see if you can somehow incorporate more of a wedge-like serif on the C and S --
    those two seem to be naked compared to the others. You might also consider removing
    the sharp apexes, rounding them slightly. Maybe dulling down all the sharp points
    throughout just a hair. Maybe rendering it a bit more hammered and chiseled. &#62;&#62;&#62;
    just thoughts. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: thanks....the serifs have been tricky for me.  I have two flavors at play
    here. <BR> <BR>I think I will try and thicken the c and s serifs so that they
    coincide with the others. <BR> <BR>thanks again.

  body: the &#34;c&#34; &#34;u&#34; and &#34;s&#34; seem to be floating just a little,
    like they are not on the same baseline as the &#34;ami&#34;. YOur guides may show
    that they are, but if they don&#39;t go below &#40;slightly&#41; the same baseline
    as the &#34;ami&#34; they would seem slightly above it, because they are curved
    letters...just a thought....

  body: I think that sloped cut at the top of &#34;A&#34; could be a bit out of context.
    &#34;M&#34; seems to be slightly too narrow &#40;comparing to &#34;C&#34; or &#34;U&#34;
    for example...&#41; and &#34;S&#34; seems to be rotated 180 deg, probably because
    the upper curve is the same size as the lower. I think it should be smaller. I
    agree with Tiffany about heavier serifs at C and S. I hope we will see the new
    version soon. It could be a nice piece.

  body: The inverted serifs are nice but perhaps a bit dated.  <BR>Traditionally letters
    such as C and S would be approx 4% taller because they have curves. Here they
    look they same. I may suggest the changes made in the attachment.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12625.gif"

  body: '[ ]  I agree with Ole&#39;s remarks about the C and S. <BR> <BR>[ ]  I think
    that perhaps the apex &#40;apexes?&#41; on the A and M need to be made more similar,
    perhaps? <BR> <BR>[ ]  Perhaps the opposite of what Ole suggested on the &#34;thicker&#34;
    parts of the C and U. In other words, make the thicks a bit thicker instead of
    thickening up the thins. ah! <BR> <BR>[ ]  Not sure if this has been suggested,
    but what if the U were a V?? Silly idea? <BR> <BR>[ ] Serifs are much improved.
    However, the C and S continue to seem a bit small in the serifs. But, I&#39;m
    not sure how to fix them. :^\'
