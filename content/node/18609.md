  body: awfully hard to tell if it's a font or handlettering from just the 2 words
    but perhaps someone will recognize it.

  body: This is from the back of Pink Floyd's <em>The Wall</em> album, right? That
    was released in 1979. This is almost certainly hand-lettered.

  body: There must be a design credit on the record sleeve, or in the CD liner notes?
    I have the CDs here, but my liner notes are at home in the States :(

    Scarfe</a> did both the lettering and artwork for the original double album, but
    I don't recognise lettering above, which is in a different style and not nearly
    as vicious as Scarfe's lettering.

    a Pink Floyd t-shirt. I had no idea!
