  body: I think I made a mistake in the thread you linked Patricia...  <BR>Opti would
    be sold by Castcraft and it&#39;s probably in one of the packages. <BR> <BR><a

    <BR> <BR>the Casady and Green script that is now <BR>unavailable is Sedona Script
    ... which is similar but different. <BR> <BR>bj
