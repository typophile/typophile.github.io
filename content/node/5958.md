  to hopefully have a font I love identified. Thus far between he and three newsgroups,
  no one has been able to tell me what it is. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42250.jpg"

  old style eyeglass piece or monicle &#40;sp&#41; that I&#39;d find it with that
  title, but no. <BR> <BR>As was said in a movie before, &#34;You are my only hope.&#34;

  body: Suzanne, concider its a combination of a font and cleaver work in Illustrator.
    The g could be modified and there are only 2 of them. There is that kind of false
    embossed photoshop effect it leads me to think this isn&#39;t a typeface.

    <BR>As for the &#34;false embossed photoshop effect&#34;, that is actually a filter
    used often in Jasc&#39;s Paint Shop Pro, and I imagine the more expensive Photoshop,
    called &#34;Super Blade Pro&#34;. I use it often myself to add bevels, edges,
    shine and more on various tags and website headers. I know how the tag was made,
    just wish someone knew the font. &#60;sigh&#62; <BR> <BR>Thank you for trying
    though, you are the first person to do so other than Mike. Hugs for trying! <BR>
    <BR>Here is another example of what Paint Shop Pro and filter effects can do,
    among thousands of other effects: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42300.jpg"
