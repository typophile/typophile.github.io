  body: Most likely it&#39;s custom, but the lower-case is not extremely distinctive
    -- many formal scripts have similar forms. Check out <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg1.html">Mike
    Yanega&#39;s site</a> for a selection. There&#39;s nothing there, though, that
    remotely looks like the Budweiser B. If all you need is a clean version of the
    logo, though, go to <a href="http://web.brandsoftheworld.com/?id=112&amp;query_id=3139212&amp;page=1&amp;brand_id=26990">Brands
    of the World</a>. You can also do a search there for Budweiser and find a lot
    of Bud logos. <BR> <BR>&#40;And Miller ones, too!&#41;
