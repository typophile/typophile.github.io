  designer, artist, etc. and am looking to create a large piece of 'Typographical
  Art'. I've searched the forums and the 'net and can't seem to find anything. I might
  have accidentally made up the term in a dream, judging by my success, but I know
  I've seen some type-based art, I just can't remember where. I'm basically after
  any art, and I don't want to get into a discussion about what is and isn't art,
  that not only uses type to communicate it's message but does so without relying
  on the text and does not contain any significant graphical elements. I assume there
  is some stuff out there. I would love any pointer as to where I can find it. I really
  just want to see what people are doing in this field before I really start. \r\n\r\nThis
  is just a personal project so I'm in no rush to get it done, though I want the first
  piece finished by christmas (hopefully).\r\n\r\nI'd also like to say that the forum
  (and site) is amazing and well done for creating a pro atmosphere without making
  it at all intimidating. I'm so impressed, I might by a t-shirt or two. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPete.
  :)"

    ago I found a boxed set (book and portfolio of prints) from 1968 in an antiquarian
    book store (with a webshop) located in San Francisco. \u2014 Sometimes I think
    the internet was invented for things like this. \u2014 Anyway, the prints were
    in perfect condition and the printing was excellent. We now keep six prints framed
    in our kitchen. \r\n \r\nI'm happy she once again attracts attention with the
    <em>Come alive</em> book.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm not sure this qualifies as typographical
    art <em>per se</em> I find some of Ben Shahns posters typographically inspiring.\r\nHere's
    a classic; <em>Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shahn_3954.jpg]"

    modern art from the Rauschenberg / Warhol era. Or Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger.
    Just do some research in a few art books and you are guaranteed to find something.\r\n\r\nGood
