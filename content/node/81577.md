  body: Thanks Jan for correcting me. You're right. I've overlooked at the sample,
    they are absolutely not the same. Sorry for that. Unfortunately, I don't know
    any match for this font either... Makes me thinking to some [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead
    fonts]]. Something like [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/countryroad.php|Country
    Road]], [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/signmaker.php|Signmaker]] or [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/antiqueshop.php|Antique
    Shop]] for instance...
