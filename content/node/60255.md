  retro-cursivey one! If anyone can drop me the name of a free one that might be out
  there, it'd me much appreciated.\r\n\r\nSecond, I'd love the font used in this flier:\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v249/isa-ma-bel/dangerous.jpg\r\n\r\nor
  the font used to spell 'garage' on this album cover:\r\nhttp://www.sundazed.com/shop/images/SC11139-300.jpg\r\n\r\nor
  any other font that may carry the same characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much
  to anyone who can help me out!\r\n\r\n-Isabel "

    fonts, you need to license them. Period.\r\n\r\nYour photobucket link doesn't
    take me to any picture. I think you need to isolate the image you want to show
    us.\r\n\r\nThe GARAGE font looks like some of the House Industries \"Shag\" stuff,
    which also means it may be like some of their Benguiat fonts. This is a sort of
    late 60's look, I think, and it seems to be coming back. Jason Walcott at Veer
    also has done some revivals of fonts from this era.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: My apologies about the link! It's fixed now, and it's actually a flier for
    the artist Shag, if that's what you meant. Thanks for the dafont.com reference!
