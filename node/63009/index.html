Can you explain to me what you see as the limitations of the interpolation tool. I use this tool a lot, have done for years, and I'm always surprised when I hear people say they don't like it or find it problematic.</div>

These items it very inefficient for shaping letters when I do not have a clear idea of what the end result should be. It is still a great tool for quickly adding or removing weight, creating small capitals, etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">James:

<em>• The inability to change my zoom once I start using it.</em>

Is that a Mac FL limitation, I wonder? No problem with this in the Windows version.

<em>• The nature of the tool is the alter the entire letter unless I lock down a bunch of points.</em>

Well, yes, that's what it's for: interpolating the position of untouched nodes. The interpolate tool has two states for nodes: touched and untouched. A touched node is one that has been clicked on while the tool is active, whether or not it has also been moved. Touched nodes are, thereform, either moved or locked in their original positions. And all the untouched nodes move relative to the locked nodes, i.e. the position of the untouched nodes is interpolated.

<em>• I have to repeatedly drag points to different potential locations until I get a result I like.</em>

I tend to use the ctrl+click dialogue interface, rather than dragging, but in either case I don't understand why this constitutes a ‘limitation’. You look at your glyph, and you figure out what parts you want moved and in what relationship to other parts, and you touch only the nodes that you need to touch to achieve that result, letting other node positions be interpolated.

There are a couple of things that I do think are genuine limitations of this tool:

1. It isn't dynamically interactive with Fine Preview. I wish it were, so that I could get a nice preview of the results while in the middle of interpolate operations.

2. Moving a whole section of a glyph, e.g. a stem, a uniform distance relative to another part of the glyph always requires touching at least two points. Christian's script seeks to address this limitation, by making it possible to select and shift multiple nodes, but it seems to me that it does it in a way that is overall much less flexible and powerful than the interpolate tool. Consider:

Let's say I have an uppercase U glyph, and I decide I want to make it a little wider by moving the two vertical stems further apart. Using Christian's tool, I can select the nodes making up the left vertical stem, and use the nudge left tool to shift them, say 20 units. But only the positions of the control handles between the bottom selected moved nodes and the nodes defining the bottom of the horizontal curve are interpolated. I have to then go and perform the opposite select and nudge operations on the right side vertical. Using the interpolate tool, all I have to do is lock two nodes on the left vertical and shift two nodes on the right vertical 40 units, and the position of the nodes on the curve is interpolated along with the control handles. That seems way more efficient and useful to me.</div>

Unfortunately there is a bug in the Mac version of FLS5. Values entered in the dialog are not applied properly. Outlines get distorted. So it is not possible to adjusted outlines in controlled manner which renders this function useless for Mac users. Reported long ago but no update yet.</div>

Using the interpolation tool to add weight to an "o", or an "n", is no problem. The places I run in to trouble is were diagonals meet each other or a stem (like in "M"), were terminals are cut at an angle (like in my illustration) and usually in tight spaces (like "s", which I have found easier to just completely redraw each time).</div>

Why on earth would you want to add the same amount of weight all over?

Perhaps you are after the dreaded "letters dipped in chocolate" syndrome we are all advised to avoid. But why?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>Do you usually add ink traps at the last stage?</cite>

I try to avoid drawing traditional ink traps because designers can’t be bothered to convert large type to outlines and remove visible traps. Hiding it in a long taper works just as well except in particularly adverse conditions when a specialized type should be used instead. When I do have to draw them in they’re pretty big so I just work them into the letter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe not "traditional ones" (I'm not even sure what that means)
but trapping is good for you, and a designer who can't be bothered
to remove them: shouldn't be using a text face so large; and won't
mind the artefacts anyway!  :-/

		<div class="commentbody">There are in my mind two different issues here. One is time-saving ways to work. And here various software can help to get toward what you want, and what to use is a matter of personal preference. 

The other issue is what a good related heavier weight looks like. Here you have a lot of decisions that can't be made well by any formula, which I think it James M's point. 

For a start, the visual impact of horizontal and vertical increases in weight will be different. This can be taken into account in software, but all diagonal strokes and arcs will get double doses if you mechanically bold in both horizontal directions, resulting in a lot of ugliness, including clotted joins. I suspect that is the issue Frode was running into, prompting the post. 

How to handle the joins is an aesthetic decision that isn't automatic, and this will affect all the arcs as well. How much do you want to preserve relative weights, and how much the same arcs? You can't do both. 

A further complication is when you have more than two strokes involved, like a e W M. Then bolding is going to decrease the size of the counters more than in those with two strokes. So again you have to make a choice: do you want to widen the glyph? Widen some of the strokes less than in other characters? 

There are other decisions as well, but these are enough to show that there isn't one "right" way to get a bolder weight, and the designer needs to, well, design, as James M. says. 

Another issue is how much you want the different weights to look the same. Frutiger pioneered a lot of weights and widths looking similar, with his Univers. But this modernist idea is not the only way to go. Jonathan Hoefler, in his blurb for Knockout, argues that having different looks in different sizes, as type traditionally did, can be a good thing.  </div>
