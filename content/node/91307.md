  a complete font. I saw that the non latin has been designed but no traces of the
  latin version ?\r\n"

    But there's also no way it's a public font...\r\n\r\nAFAIK Neville Brody has done
    work for MS,\r\nso you might ask him. He's a nice guy too.\r\n\r\nI'm also getting
    a Jeremy Tankard vibe.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
