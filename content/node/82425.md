  I saw that the hinting for the two is not exactly the same. When viewing the two
  glyphs in a word processor, I saw a difference between the two. So how can I make
  an exact copy of a glyph? Should I also duplicate some information inside the font\u2019s
  table? Any simpler solution?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: If you copied the glyph from the Glyph window, then all you got were the outlines.
    Copy and paste the glyph from the Font WIndow and all of the information should
    be included. Then there is always "Paste Special".

  body: "jmontalbano - thanks for your answer. I have copied the glyph from the Font
    windows, and still, hinting is not the same for the two glyphs. I have also tried
    the 'Paste Special' option, selecting all the check buttons. When I have open
    the new glyph and try to see its hinting, \r\nFontLab give me a message: \"current
    glyph doesn't match TrueType requirements\", and ask if I want to fix this. I
    choose to fix it, and the same problem - hinting is not exactly the same for the
    two glyphs."

  body: You could try "Generate Glyphs".  Using the original glyph name followed by
    a period and suffix of your choice will force FL to reference the original glyph.
    Once the new glyph is present, you can rename it if necessary.

  body: I suppose the really simple solution would be to create a new glyph and place
    the original glyph as a Component.

  body: "jmontalbano, Thanks a lot for your help - I added the original as a component
    and it works perfect. I'm new to font editors and didn't know about this option.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me that DejaVu sans is manually hinted, so when copy an outline of a
    glyph, you get an original glyph manually hinted, and a second one auto hinted.
    And when making a full copy from the Font Window, you get a message indicating
    that this operation will cause a loss of the font's original OpenType tables."
