  anyone know of anything similar without such a curvy P...? (Kind of reminds me of
  the Pioneer logo). I would like the r and the n to remain as similar as possible
  though.\r\nAny suggestions?\r\nThanks for taking a look..."

    might be something as commonplace as Tahoma Bold\u2014don't match the rest of
    the letters."

  body: Thanks for the reply I'll keep searching. Someone identified the font as D3
    Archism, I'm considering editing the P myself because I do like it as it is.

  body: "I think you're on to something there. I tried de-slanting and horizontally
    condensing the thing until it looked like something it might have started as:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Photronics2_5145.png]\r\nIndeed
    this seems cobbled together. Proportions and details are all over the place. The
    \"c\" and \"s\" are larger, the \"t\" also looks like it might have belonged to
    whatever the \"c\" and \"s\" are from, the \"i\" is too short (tho maybe that's
    \"design\"). The \"r\" looks like something out of Harabara or some other bad
    free font. The \"h\" also looks like amateur work (the \"n\" with an ascender
    stuck on, with no corrections). So does the \"P\" (quite unbalanced). If this
    is a font, as in one font, I'll be worried.\r\n.\r\nEdit: D3 Archism? OK, color
    me worried. Wow\u2026 It even comes pre-squooshed. :-\\"

    make a rough edit of the proportions in Photoshop, possibly Illustrator although
    I don't know how to use the latter very well.\r\nI can post my results after if
    anyone's interested?"
