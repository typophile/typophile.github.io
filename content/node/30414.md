    about Gutenberg's type to make a judgement on my own.

  body: "<cite>What do you mean by sympathetic, Conor?</cite>\r\n\r\nApologies, an
    unsupported statement.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m no expert on Gutenberg myself, but when
    comparing <strong>FF Johannes G</strong> (which I was aware of prior to my first
    post) with <strong>Gutenberg Bibelschrift</strong>, the former seemed very chunky
    and misshapen, while the latter appeared more elegant and <em>sympathetic</em>
    to the handwritten forms Gutenberg strived to recreate.\r\n\r\nSo, a merely personal
    opinion."

    think the choice is more one of purpose here. While Bibelschrift has a cleaner
    look more reminiscent of calligraphy, FF Johannes G tries to get at the feel of
    early letterpress printing. If you are going more for the likeness of the printed
    book, FF Johannes G is the better choice. If the calligraphic hand which inspired
    the type is what you are after, then you might want Bibelschrift. Both are valid.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
