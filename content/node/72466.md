    on the system you are using. You'll have to enable it on that system, and create
    a file in notepad called autorun.inf with these two lines (substituting the name
    of your PDF file - no space characters allowed):\r\n\r\n[autorun]\r\nshellexecute=\"yourfile.pdf\"\r\n\r\nSave

  body: "You didnt understand me guys :) I do have a full version, i do know how to
    set the open options. The problem is THE POPUP WINDOW that my clients will see
    when they open the file! It says: \"This document is trying to put Acrobat in
    full screen mode (...) would you like to allow this document to enter full screen
    mode automatically?\". I dont want them to see it so im looking for a way to skip
    it. \r\n\r\nPls help. If i wont find a solution ill have to make the presentation
    in flash :(((( "

    to take over their entire monitor by surprise. It's not expected behavior (except
    maybe for games). I've known folks who get very annoyed when a program does that
    unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nAsking the user's permission before going full screen is
    not necessarily a bad thing. \r\n"

    takeovers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can find an older version of Acrobat Reader that
    doesn't have the warning, and tell your clients to download that.\r\n\r\n(Do you
    really think it's such a bad form to <em>tell</em> your clients that they can
    choose whatever they like, but your presentation is best viewed full screen?)"

  body: "Hm, that's what happens when I create a test PDF in Acrobat 7, and then someone
    views it in Reader 8! How rubbish! Can't help, in that case... \r\n\r\nSo: what
    James & Theunis said (though I don't imagine anyone would take to the suggestion
    that they downgrade their Acrobat reader!). (a) put up with the popup, (b) flash,
    (c) there are probably shareware utilities on the web somewhere that'd turn a
    PDF into a self-running executable (haven't looked into whether those would then
    be runnable full-screen) - see whether things like PDF2EXE are any good (no idea)."
