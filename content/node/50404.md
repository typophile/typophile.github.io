body: "Is it possible to use python or Robofab to replicate Fontlabs 'copy to composites'
  command ?\r\n\r\nI know I could use something like this to update sidebearings of
  glyphs.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfrom robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\n#\r\nE
  = ['Emacron','Ebreve','Edotaccent','Eogonek','Ecaron','Egrave','Eacute','Ecircumflex','Edieresis']\r\n#\r\nfor
  glyphName in E:\r\n        f[glyphName].leftMargin = f['E'].leftMargin\r\n\tf[glyphName].rightMargin
  = f['E'].rightMargin\r\n#\r\nf.update()\r\n#\r\nprint \"E composites updated\"\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  works fine until I get to the situation where the accents of glyphs over hang the
  sidebearing of the base glyph, this is where I would use the 'copy to composites'
  command or the measurement line.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_3563.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing
  'copy to composites' is fine if not time consuming, but I have decomposed the composites
  in the process of generating the intermediate weight from a MM font. If I could
  write one macro that ensured all glyphs had the correct sidebearing it would save
  me loads of time.\r\n\r\nRr"

  body: "If it's not possible to achieve this with a macro I'll have to go down the
    road of using Metrics classes, but I know it would be alot quicker and simpler
    using a macro.\r\n\r\nMertics Class Method:\r\n\r\n1. Create the classes - a seperate
    class for most of the uppercase, lowercase and smallcaps.\r\n2. Open up each font
    and import the metrics classes \r\n3. In each font, Tools - Metrics Assistance.\r\n4.
    Select the classes, click Use the measurement line then Apply and save.\r\n5.
    Delete the metrics classes from the classes panel - I don't see the need in leaving
    them there as they are just temporary \r\n\r\nMacro Method (if it's possible)\r\n\r\n1.
    Create the macro\r\n2. Call the macro in each font.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
