  body: 'I think if it looks bizarre, like Eduardo Recife''s stuff, then it must be
    cutting edge. I heard a fontmaker named Carson is supposed to be cutting edge
    with some of his graphic design, but some of his things I saw would indicate that
    cutting edge is anything you can convince a customer to pay lots of money for.
    More power to him, I guess. '

    I saw were quite nice. And possibly if his commision was to make something *arrestingly*
    ugly, then the customer definitely got his money's worth. So maybe I'll have to
    give him the benefit of the doubt. \r\n\r\nOf course, I'd love a customer like

    to post things where their style might be criticized?\r\n"

    used this forum for several critiques and every time the responses have contributed
    to better work. The reason I don't post all of my work is because I feel that
    if I'm going to be asking others' opinions I should put some time into evaluating
    other work on the forum. Often, I just don't have that time. \r\n\r\n> Which is
    sad.\r\n\r\n\"Established\" designers seek criticism, no? Just that it's not on
    forums but through employees. I work on my own but show everything I do to a group
    of people whose opinion I value. That's probably a reason many people don't post
    on forums--one often doesn't know the credibility of the audience. Now, this can
    sound like a good thing, but I've seen it just be annoying."
