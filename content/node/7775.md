body: Hi, I&#39;m working on a new logo for service that we provide called BorderConnect.  The
  service is still in its infancy really as most of the carriers using the service
  signed-on through our network of contacts and not through general advertising.  What
  we have in terms of a clean design is not horrible-looking &#40;<a href="http://www.borderconnect.com"
  target="_blank">www.borderconnect.com</a>&#41;, but it lacks uniqueness and I think
  it&#39;s not really speaking to the target audience.  There is no mark either.  Needless
  to say, I want to improve the identity and look of the service as we extend outside
  the technology enthusiasts. <BR> <BR>So what is the service about?  Well, the service
  allows carriers in Canada and the United States to visualize their border activity
  so that they can react to problems at the border beforehand when shipments are not
  properly documented or when other problems occur.  Traditionally, the exporter/importor/broker
  knows when there is a problem but the carriers don&#39;t, so they often have to
  go to a customs compound which delays shipments for a few hours.  Sometimes they
  get put into bond &#40;not just for these reasons, but others&#41;, which can last
  days, weeks or months.  The software cannot 100% prevent carriers from going into
  bond or into a compound, but it can reduce it effectively.  I want to get this across
  if I can. <BR> <BR>Since BorderConnect records all the border activity for a carrier,
  it is broker-agnostic.  This means that they no longer have to spend time and money
  making phone calls to brokers to see if their shipments are properly released. <BR>
  <BR>Lastly, BorderConnect can help with audits because sometimes a shipment comes
  under dispute and if you cannot proof of release the company make take large penalties
  which basically act as very large financial fines &#40;4 and 5 digits&#41;. <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;ve tried really hard to come up with some ideas to desribe this brand
  but I&#39;m having trouble.  Since the product is for carriers, I want to let them
  know that.  Note that I don&#39;t mean drivers because they have no authority to
  make the purchase.  I&#39;ve found that only operations directors or even the evp/vps/etc.
  typically sign on to our system, not the dispatcher managers or drivers.  So, it
  needs to appeal to them while also letting them know the service is really meant
  to help the dispatch personnel and the drivers. <BR> <BR>I also want to convey that
  BorderConnect allows a carrier to basically cross the border more reliably/predictably
  because they are now empowered to make decisions before the last minute with this
  real-time information. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m finding it hard to convey this brand though.  It&#39;s
  hard not to use cliches like arrows which are very, very abused in this industry.  I
  also want to avoid swooshes and the like obviously.  I want to make something that
  is not trendy.  I strive to make the mark/type reflect the qualities of the service
  and the name itself.  I like it when logos have a logical purpose to them while
  being intuitive as well.  I&#39;m just not very skilled at doing that. <BR> <BR>Here
  are some versions I have made myself.  I&#39;d feel very appreciative if anyone
  can critique them and help me focus on an idea that actually works.  Please be very
  critical and let me know what you think.  I&#39;m just getting frustrated, not being
  a real designer or anything &#40;just a software programmer&#41;.

    I don&#39;t like Enterprise either it implies risk. <BR> <BR>I like the typeface
    of Border Connect and the color but I don&#39;t think you need a mark. Its already
    abstract and you don&#39;t need to add to the confussion.

  body: 'As you can see, I&#39;ve tried to use lines or frames to communicate the
    word &#34;border&#34;.  There actually isn&#39;t a lot of well-known companies
    that have Border in it&#39;s name, but for us, it&#39;s rather fitting seeing
    as  we can show a carrier&#39;s entire border status in real-time and keep a record
    of it for 20 years if necessary. <BR> <BR>The first logo tried to make use of
    the blue on the site, but I realized that it looked kind of watered down and the
    greens stood out a lot better.  I think a lot of companies don&#39;t really use
    these colours so they look pretty unique to me.  Besides, a company that sort
    of competes with us is blue and when I think of maps and borders, I think of land
    which is brown and green.  I happen to like green better.  Early versions of the
    software that ran in test used orange and brown actually.  While I can make good
    use of stylesheets, fonts and padding &#40;I think anyway&#41;, it wasn&#39;t
    really working. <BR> <BR>So, after I decided to go with greens I thought making
    a frame of a circle would work with the typeface and create a border.  I used
    a series of connecting arrows to build the frame, which tries to emphasis the
    connecting-border.  The arrow shows some direction, but it really doesn&#39;t
    suggest that your trucks can get through the border easily.  It makes a &#34;C&#34;,
    which also is one of the letters, but I think it looks like garbage and the &#34;C&#34;
    is pretty cliche so off to design #3. <BR> <BR>In #3, I decided to move the letters
    closer-together.  This made it look better because the logo wasn&#39;t so wide
    and it gave the feel that the letters &#34;connected&#34; better.   I took this
    concept a little further and tried to illustrate that the letters were connecting
    as you can see with the &#39;o&#39; and the first &#39;n&#39;  I only wanted to
    use straight lines because lines can resemble borders.  I think it looks clean
    and has something going for it, but it&#39;s noticable from far away so it&#39;s
    pretty worthless seeing as this logo is being posted up on walls, billboards next
    to border locations across canada and the us possibly. <BR> <BR>In #4, I went
    with the literal interpretation of a border and just added an arrow.  This one
    looks like crap but it was just a thought. <BR> <BR>#5 is pretty neat but isn&#39;t
    noticable enough.  The O is like a frame or border in of itself and it illustrates
    the connecting theme.  #6 tries to do the same thing with an actual logo. <BR>
    <BR>#7 was just an experiment, something to connect the letters in an interesting
    way and create a mark in the type. <BR> <BR>As for the tagline, please don&#39;t
    put too much stock into it because I haven&#39;t really thought about it.  I just
    think I need something there to give the logo more of a rectangular look, otherwise
    the type just looks too wide.'

  body: You need a tagline to explain the service. Its not an afterthought, its as
    important as the name. I&#39;m suprised you didn&#39;t try to get the word express
    or direct into either the tagline or name. A Thesaurus is a good thing.

  body: 'I apoligize for the misspell; I was thinking about it&#39;s visual characteristics
    as opposed to what it was going to say. <BR> <BR>I really want to avoid the word
    &#34;express&#34; though.  I constantly see that word being used for logistics,
    transportation via air, road or train and many other trade companies - even credit
    cards &#40;American Express&#41;.  I think it&#39;s one of those words like &#34;soft&#34;
    at the end of software companies, or even more generic than that.  In this industry
    though, people use company suffixes like &#34;express&#34;, &#34;global logistics&#34;,
    &#34;logistics&#34;, &#34;transportation&#34;,  etc. way too much.  Federal Express
    even realized how generic the words really are and went with something more unique:
    FedEx. <BR> <BR>&#34;Connect&#34; can be kind of cliche too, like express, but
    it fits since carriers really aren&#39;t that connected to the border.  They often
    cross blindly and find out if the shipment was not released when they arrive.  This
    happens because they are working on assumptions and information from sources they
    cannot control.  Our software tries to directly connect them with their border
    crossing activities rather than going through brokers over the phone.   It also
    works in the literal sense since a major component of our software is called the
    Customs Internet Gateway, which is the connectivity module that sends and receives
    digital messages directly from Canada customs.  That&#39;s why I think &#34;direct&#34;
    can be a very good word for a tagline and I&#39;m very appreciative for this suggestion.  I
    makes a lot of sense to me. <BR> <BR>Does anything I&#39;ve said help clarify
    what the service does?'

  body: Ken, nice work. I&#39;m not a big fan of letterspacing to make the type flush
    left and right. Try removing the letterspacing and tuck the tagline either under
    Border or Connect. You might warm-up the tagline add the word Because. Also look
    at the tagline in Sentence case.

  body: Still looking through magazines it seems if I ever did put an ad in one, we&#39;d
    stand out quite a bit.  9/10 companies use italics in the company name, tagline
    or both.  If they don&#39;t, they use an arrow or a swoosh.  I&#39;m glad BorderConnect
    doesn&#39;t use any of these.   <BR> <BR>I also notice that delivering shipments
    &#34;on time, every time&#34; is a popular phrase that everyone copies off each-other.  Most
    of them say they provide everything from e-commerce to warehousing to frieght
    forwarding to whatever.  It&#39;s funny because if every company does everything,
    what&#39;s the point of letting people know?  It seems that nobody is doing anything
    different.  Well, there was this &#34;Plan Bee&#34; company that really had something
    neat going for it.  DHL&#39;s ad was good too. <BR> <BR>I know BorderConnect doesn&#39;t
    even compete in the slightest with any logistics company &#40;not even the same
    thing in the slightest&#41;, but there really isn&#39;t much to look to with respect
    to people in the same industry other than maybe carriers and companies targeting
    the drivers themselves. <BR> <BR>Anyway, looking forward to trying out those modifications
    and seeing how they look.
