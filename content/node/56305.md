body: Hello! I was hoping I could get some suggestions for typefaces that work with
  Birch. I've designed a logo with Birch (which is not as horrible as it might sound),
  but now I'm having a hard time finding a simpler typeface to use in the identity
  system that does not clash with the logo. Any ideas?

  body: "It's a bit tough to make suggestion without some information about the organization
    you designed the logo for and how it might be used. Perhaps you might share some
    more context?\r\n\r\nMy initial suggestion is to try something like  [[http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.htm?pid=202016|ITC
    Cushing Book]] for body text, which carries some of the condensed feel but is
    decidedly less angular."
