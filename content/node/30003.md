    with Stephen and Conor in that I wish the ampersand were aligned with the small
    caps. The same reasoning follows how I wish the figures and punctuation would
    align with small caps too.

    to begin a sentence with a conjunction such as 'and', 'but' or 'so'. In fact a

    that begin with 'And' can be and usually are gramatically complete sentences.
    \r\n\r\nI don't really want to argue this as every authority disagrees with you--I
    just checked two more. \r\n\r\nBut if you are so confident that it is always better
    to avoid an 'and' or 'but' try eliminating the beginning 'ands' and 'buts' in
    the following and by doing it improve them. If you improve them I will gladly
    concede your point.  \r\n\r\nHere are those lame writers who worked for King James
    (reflecting the original Hebrew, which has all the 'ands' also):\r\n\r\n\"In the
    beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Now the earth was unformed and
    void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hovered
    over the face of the waters. And God said: 'Let there be light.' And there was
    light. And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from
    the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.
    And there was evening and there was morning, one day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here is that
    dabbler Lincoln starting with a 'but':\r\n\r\n\"Four score and seven years ago
    our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty,
    and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\n\"Now
    we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation
    so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field
    of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting
    place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether
    fitting and proper that we should do this.\r\n\r\n\"But, in a larger sense, we
    can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground.
    The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above
    our poor power to add or detract. ....\"\r\n\r\nAnd here is that fumbler Churchill,
    again starting with a 'but':\r\n\r\n\"I expect that the Battle of Britain is about
    to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization. Upon
    it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and
    our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on
    us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war.
    If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may
    move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world,
    including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will
    sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted,
    by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties,
    and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for
    a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'\"\r\n\r\nThese
    examples can be multiplied at will, both for the 'ands' and the  'buts', with
    every distinguished author you can name. But these three will keep you busy for
    quite a while trying to improve upon them ;)\r\n\r\nOh, and one more, a rather
    articulate fellow writing on type: \r\n\r\n\"Economics favor size, and digital
    culture has come to be dominated by a few companies--arbiters of taste--that rely
    on a handful of creatives for their content, which they spread worldwide at low
    margin. Individual purchasers are disinclined to commission local photographers
    or illustrators when they can get stock for far less. And why buy a contemporary
    typeface family when you can get Neue Helvetica, 51 fonts, for US$300? Not to
    mention all the free fonts that come with OS X.\"\r\n\r\nI would say that both
    the 'and' and the following incomplete sentence are excellent prose style. And
    maybe the writer, Nick Shinn, when he is not kissing the boots of his misguided
    teachers, would also agree :)  "

    beginning with conjunctions, as you can easily verify. (I won't bore you with

    in a sequence of short sentences is key to the rhythm that gives the rhetoric
    its power. \r\n\r\nNick, \r\n\r\nI certainly think that teachers should teach
    different many different ways to make transitions between sentences. And they
    should explain how they can go wrong, what has better precision and power, etc.
    What you seemed to defend in your post of 2:11 is that it is advantageous to tell
    kids what is false--that you should never begin a sentence with a conjunction--and
    hold them to it as this false instruction is pedagogically good as a stepping
    stone to later adult practice. I don't agree. I think it is far better just to
    \ teach them how to do it right in the first place. \r\n\r\nIf teachers want to

    Adam, the bizarre thing is that nobody seems to mind or even notice the continual
    use of conjunctions at the beginning of sentences--including those who rail against
    it in theory. Some adults will passionately agree with this principle, but almost
    all ignore it in practice. "

    actually say we're largely in agreement. The term \"voice\" doesn't always have
    to refer to first person. You're waaaaaaay to literal sometimes. Again...not a
    fan of using the Bible as an example. I feel its a low blow. I wouldn't be so
    bold as to say what I wrote above was an improvement necessarily, just another
    way of writing it. \r\n\r\nRules can be broken...I wouldn't classifly the Bible
    as a dryly written annual report. Because of that IMHO, the two styles can't be
    fairly compared. When a document is rigidly written with little or no emotion
    or expression, beginning a sentence with \"and\" just <em>looks wrong</em>. This
    is more a matter of opinion than something that can be debated and supported with
    \"hard evidence.\"\r\n\r\nBill, I also find many of your arguments to be devoid
    of a crucial element. We're all human beings. We have emotions, we have feelings,
    and our actions are often visceral and come \"from the gut.\" Because you're a
    writer I'm often surprised by how much you seem to rely on others opinions in
    order to formulate your own. I'd like to know more about what \"Bill\" thinks."

  body: ">a dryly written annual report\r\n\r\nI agree that different styles call
    for different ways of handling transitions, but none that I know of call for a
    rule against starting a sentence with a conjunction. \r\n\r\nFor example here
    is an 'and' beginning a sentence in IBM's annual report of 2005: \r\n\r\n\"We\u2019ve
    been seeing a transition in services over the past few years, a shift to smaller
    deals of shorter\r\nduration. These are good opportunities\u2014if you\r\ncan
    recalibrate your sales model to capture them in\r\naddition to the traditional
    \u201Cmega-deals.\u201D And the\r\nprofitability of these kinds of deals is very
    attractive,\r\nif your global cost structure is competitive. We had\r\nto address
    both our sales model and services cost\r\nstructure last year, and we did so.
