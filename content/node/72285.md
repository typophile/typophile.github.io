  what this is? I can't find anything on whatthefont or identifont (although I found
  a few other nifty fonts of course.) The fact that some of the letters are rotated
  and perhaps skewed probably threw off the software.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/braniac-font_4240.jpg]"

  body: Nevermind. I found it purely by chance, scrolling through every single font
    in FontExplorer. It's [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=dolores&x=0&y=0|Dolores]],
    and it's a combination of upper and lower case letters (the "c" is actually the
    uppercase.)
