body: I&#39;m in the initial process of developing a logo for a friend&#39;s business,
  My PC Handyman. I&#39;m looking for some concepts to work up. It&#39;s a little
  bit of a clunky name, but I think there&#39;s potential as well. I have considered
  using a toolbox theme, a more digital theme, as well as his idea of a figure carrying
  a computer. <BR> <BR>My concern is the name and if I add a graphic that it might
  be distracting to the name. I&#39;m also conerned about the &#39;PC&#39; part. I
  don&#39;t want it to get lost and hopefully PC is interpretted properly. <BR> <BR>Any
  thoughts? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Adam

  body: I would definately create some sort of symbol to go with the name. I just
    finished working on a logo for a company called UPS For Less. They specialize
    in UPS units &#40;uninterupted power supplies&#41; and have nothing to do with
    the courier service so I had to make that clear like the problem you are having.
    <BR> <BR>After some advice from some people on these forums I ended up creating
    a simple symbol and also added a tagline below below that made it clear they were
    in a totaly different business.

  body: Thanks Tom. I did go through your thread and the tagline does help. That is
    a worthy idea I will implement. <BR> <BR>Am I crazy to try and figure out a handyman
    combined with a computer-related concept? Too catchy or cliche? Toolbox or belt
    with a mouse or monitor or something? hmm... <BR> <BR>Adam

    cliche IMHO. Not very original. It&#39;ll get lost in the plethora of computer
    repair shop names out there. <BR> <BR>But, then again, PC repair is a pretty dry

  body: The problem with generic symbols or using things like OS logos is that PC
    repair is already a fairly generic industry. Well, maybe that&#39;s not a problem...just
    an observation. I suppose you need to ask if the client is looking to sell commodity
    services or premier services and then approach the identity work from that perspective.

    PC should be emphasized as opposed to the way it is now, the black on the rest
    of the type is much more noticable.

    I have been working with this logo as a 2-color logo with the PC and the tagline
    in the same color while the My Handyman text is in another. I will need to make
    it work as a 1-color as well. Any thoughts about this? <BR> <BR>Thanks again,

  body: I think the mark you created really helps to make the typography more approachable.  Have
    you tried integrating pc or some sort of representation for the name into the
    mark itself?  I am thinking about when it might be used alone without the wordmark.  It
    seems like a step in the right direction, much more friendly. <BR> <BR>-s.

    of the icon.  Shawn&#39;s idea is a good one.  When I saw your initial concept
    my thought was &#34;Why isn&#39;t there an icon of a computer monitor in the middle
    of the logo with &#39;PC&#39; within it?&#34;  That incorporates the graphic/name
    into one concise image - rather than looking as if the icon was just slapped up
    against the name as an afterthought.  Another option might be to make your toolbox
    graphic look like a computer monitor with the addition of the screen shape on
    the side of an elongated toolbox. <BR> <BR>- J. <BR> <BR>::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::

  body: I agree about the addition of the icon to the logo. Perhaps even an implementation
    of a mouse with the tool box or something to represent the pc side of things.
    A mouse is something standard like a monitor that dosn&#39;t associate itself
    with a particular OS or area of computer work as well.

    it happens on friday sometimes. <BR> <BR>All i really meant was with the logo
    that has the mouse - it seems to be placed really close to the my pc handyman.
    <BR> <BR>I was also wondering if you had thought about how the combination might
    work when a vertical orientation was necessary.  Of course a vertical orientation
    might never be necessary, but if it is its always better to have an option, rather
    than seeing your client squish it in word or something. <BR> <BR>hope that made

  body: I really like the execution of the mouse idea. The first monitor one looks
    nice but i don&#39;t think it communicates &#34;computer&#34; as well as the mouse
    does, just because the shape of the monitor isn&#39;t as recognizable. <BR> <BR>I
    would definately keep fiddling around with the mouse and toolbox icon with different
    arrangements of text. Like Shawn said maybe a vertical arrangement. <BR> <BR>Other
    then that I agree this is a big improvement, looking forward to seeing it.

  body: 'I do agree that the mouse image works very well &#40;and that it may be a
    bit too close to the name&#41;.  With the combined toolbox/monitor image I think
    having the monitor on the end of the toolbox results in the monitor image being
    too small.  If you were going to use such an element, I think having the monitor
    on the larger side of the toolbox would make it work better and would allow it
    to still &#34;read&#34; as what you intend in smaller sizes. It&#39;s great to
    see the evolution of your concept. <BR> <BR>- J.  <BR> <BR>:: :: :: :: :: :: ::  <BR>
