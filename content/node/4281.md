  body: If you use a graphic image in a design it must mean something -- either immediately
    understood &#40;in the millesecond you will get for recognition&#41; or readily
    discovered, which is a pleasant experience for the viewer. The green roof doesn&#39;t
    explain itself and causes an awkward linkage between the m and h. I would advise
    substance over manipulation. You can&#39;t be faulted for explaining yourself
    in a clear, clean, and concise solution.

  body: '@Paul Thanks for your post the roof is supposed to close the o in moh i have
    noticed that the linkage between m and h seems a little akward, but like I said
    i got stuck. I would like to keep the o open a little an use the &#34;roof&#34;
    by itself. Do you think a different font maybe a bit bolder would help? Like I
    said I am also considering constructing a clear form of the 3 Letters &#40;just
    a form same line thickness in vertical and horizontal lines&#41; Do you think
    that would help. I hope the link between m and h won&#39;t be so awkward any more'

  body: I don&#39;t read the &#34;o&#34; at all. It needs to be connected somehow.
    Maybe add some needed weight to the &#34;h&#34; by continuing the upper right
    &#34;o&#34; curve &#40;gray&#41; to connect to the green &#34;roof&#34;. <BR>

  body: What if you made the &#39;o&#39; a full letter, entirely in green?  <BR> <BR>I
    think if you really want the O as part of the identity mark, then it needs to
    be immediately recognizable. Even if you went to something with block letters
    that defined the O as negative space, you&#39;d still be directly conveying the
    letter as opposed to suggesting it with the caret/hat.

  body: I like Chase&#39;s suggestion, green or otherwise. Maybe use the O as a target,
    or something like the RAF insignia where the blue and red circles kiss-fit. Play
    with it and give it time to work through your subconscious. It must say grafiker
    IMHO.

  body: I read this as &#34;muh&#34; all the time. <BR> <BR>If the green roof is &#34;o&#34;,
    then it should overshoot the x-height just like &#34;m&#34; and &#34;h&#34; in
    the first post, and overshoot the baseline like in the last example. Will this
    help in making clear that this is an &#34;o&#34;?

    to drop below the baseline.

    section is visually a bit high. Knock it down a touch.

  body: 'I like #5 better out of the two serif designs, but I think you might want
    to leave in the &#34;feet&#34; on the M and H to avoid people reading an rr ligature.
    Overall, it&#39;s a good design, with a nice balance of positive and negative
    space; I think #6 isn&#39;t &#39;solid&#39; enough.  <BR>I daresay I like 5 better
    than 4, but that might be because it reminds me of <a href="http://www.2river.org/gallery/indiana/love.html">this</a>. '
