  of certain contemporary typefaces in use &#40;almost all from the boom years of
  Emigre, the first middle of the 1990s&#41;. <BR>What intrigued me most was the use
  of a specific face &#40;Jon Barnbrook Ma&#40;n&#41;son&#41; in a widespread way
  but also unexpected situations: <BR>from the latest Barbie cartoons DVD to the novel
  &#34;I, Lucifer&#34;, to religious theatrical pieces posters; from Snow White and
  the Seven Dwarfs to a big &#40;and embarassingly banal&#41; Italian shopping center
  logotype. <BR> <BR>I would really love if you could drop me a line &#40;and possibly
  the URL&#41; when you see Manson used in unexpected &#40;or even expected but good&#41;
  ways. <BR> <BR>Other typefaces with a conceptual background &#40;which users cannot
  guess from the face itself&#41; I&#39;m interested in seeing and collecting samples
  of their use are: <BR> <BR>Template Gothic &#40;Emigre&#41; <BR>Keedy Sans &#40;Emigre&#41;
  <BR>Exocet &#40;Emigre&#41; <BR>Democratica &#40;Emigre&#41; <BR>Prozac &#40;Virus&#41;
  <BR>Auferstehung &#40;Linotype&#41; <BR>Circumcision/CQN Molecular &#40;T-26&#41;
  <BR>Merlin &#40;FontFont&#41; <BR>Oneleigh &#40;FontFont&#41; <BR> <BR>Most of these
  may be seen by many people as &#34;novelty faces&#34; but part of them have been
  and are undoubtedly faces reflecting our times and the relationship with the emerging
  computer technology from the late 1980s early 1990s. <BR>In different ways, of course.
  <BR>Oneleigh &#40;and Merlin&#41;, for example, I would be really interested to
  know if someone have used them in books or textsetting. <BR> <BR>Please, report
  freely also examples of any other face &#40;expecially conceptual&#41; used in an
  original or surprising way. <BR> <BR>Thank you SO much!'

  body: Thanks Sean! <BR>The use is quite strange &#40;especially in those SoBe Suzuki
    imagery&#41;, even if the graphic design is not so original and it seems they&#39;ve
    chosen manson for the &#34;mythical&#34; feeling it may give &#40;here paired
    with a somewhat cheap oriental feeeling&#41;. <BR>It seems a quite &#34;superficial
    usage&#34; &#40;like they often do with otherwise historical faces like Trajan&#41;
    but it&#39;s interesting indeed. Thank you! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m very grateful for

    never thought of democratica as a lovey-dovey face, but hey... <BR> <BR>everyone
    gave me strange looks when they gave it us. i automatically <BR>said &#34;democratica.&#34;
    my wife had to explain that any time they don&#39;t <BR>know what i&#39;m talking

    I saw when I wasn&#39;t collecting samples yet. <BR>Could you tell me more about

    why people feel always the urge to enlarge Democratica&#39;s initial letters when
    the face is meant to be unicase. Anyway, this comes most from amateurs, while
    in your sample the enlargement is moderate and works quite nice.'

  body: this book is for grown-ups, although it&#39;s disguised as a children&#39;s
    book. <BR>i don&#39;t know if you have board books in italy. in case it&#39;s
    a purely north american <BR>phenomenon, board book are printed on very thick,
    almost cardboard like paper. <BR>it&#39;s like two sheets of 179 lb. &#40;488
    gsm&#41;cover paper, each printed on one <BR>side with a glossy finish, and then
    stuck together. this particular <BR>book is about 5.25 by 5.75 inches and is 0.75
    inches thick, yet has <BR>only 28 pages, including the covers. the point is the
    pages are very thick, <BR>made so chubby little baby hands can easily grab the
    pages and turn them. <BR>the book is about a man who builds a village to protect
    all of his <BR>children from the dangerous forest surrounding them. one of the
    kids <BR>finds a whole in the outer wall of the village and crawls through, <BR>gets
    lost, etc. the man comes and saves him, etc. it&#39;s obviously an allegory <BR>for
    the choices we make and how god will help us and all of that stuff. <BR>email
    me and let me know where i should send the high res images. btw, i <BR>think the
    designer should have left the title unicase instaed of faking <BR>the caps. it&#39;s
    just weird seeing it like that.

    in other products beside the Barbie DVD &#40;and I wasn&#39;t even sure they did
    outside Italy&#41;. Here Rapunzel translates as Raperonzolo, which is one of the
    most ridiculous names you can find in Italian. I guessed the original german name
    would have been something like that. After all it&#39;s from an old fairy tale.
    Barbie just plays the role of the Princess. <BR> <BR>Please do send the hi-res
    scan. The size you&#39;ve used here it&#39;s just fine: make it 300ppi and it
    would be A-OK. In fact I mean to showcase the DVD cover in big size. <BR>This
    is because in it the &#34;dreamy&#34; and &#34;fairytalish&#34; atmosphere is
    so strong contrasting with Manson in an incredible way. The logo is also clean
    &#40;without nifty digital effects like I see in your cereal box&#41; but the
