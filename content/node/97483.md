  body: Sorry, don't know this type if it is. BTW, that's very [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus/|Bauhaus]],
    just need to recreate /Y (keep /Y vertical stroke and add a /O bottom half part),
    /U (adding 2 vertical strokes to a /O bottom half part) and /C (removing a quarter
    from a /O). For the rest, looks pretty close.
