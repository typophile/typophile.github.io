  body: "Can't find a font that could match all letters at the same time. It looks
    like to mix influences from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/grecian|Grecian]]
    (/S and /G) and some Condensed Geometric Slab-Serif (CGS-S). So, sorry, no ready-to-go
    solution... Customization might be the way. \r\nThe closest I've found is [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/gunslinger.php|LHF
    Gunslinger]] Good (formerly LHF Outlaw). The only thing to do with this is to
    remove all median spurs/thorns.\r\nAnother option would be to select a matching
    CGS-S as base and to borrow /G and /S from (Solotype) Grecian. And last one, probably
    the hardest, would to start with either a CGS-S or a Grecian and to customize
    the mismatching letters, /S and /G (more?) with a CGS-S, everything except /S
    and /G with a Grecian.\r\nSome CGS-S: [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/athleticclub.php|Athletic
