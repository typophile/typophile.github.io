  It only has to do with type regarding the e-mail content.\r\n\r\nIs it possible
  to place a flash animation directly in a e-mail body, to send for a client?\r\nCan
  it be done or i will have to create a link for the file?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nRegards
  \r\n"

    to use 1.0 HTML.\r\nYou still have animated gifs."

  body: "I know you can send HTML emails, but they aren't universally supported, and
    I've never run across an embedded SWF before.\r\n\r\nIf you included the SWF it
    would likely show up as an attachment, which you can certainly do just fine.  Provided
    they have flash player they can launch your file without even being online (after
    they download it of course)\r\n\r\nWhat I personally would do, if it's imperative
    you display the SWF in the context of a document and not just a standalone file,
    is to create an HTML page in some dark corner of the internet and then yes, link
    them to that page (within which you have embedded the SWF)\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"

    but I've also never saw an embedded swf before. As you said, it is possible to
    make a html email, but will it work with an embedded swf on it?. Creating a link
    will request hosting the file somewhere, and I don't wanna go that way.\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: "You can not embed Flash into an HTML email and have it work reliably everywhere
    - different email clients have different degrees of support even of HTML/CSS standards
    and few if any would support the Object/Embed tag needed for Flash. \r\n\r\nYou
    can attach the Flash file like a normal document attachment to the email though.\r\n\r\nAnother
    alternative would be to use Acrobat 9's new \"embed Flash\" feature but that still
    requires the PDF file to be attached like a normal document/attachment to the
    email.\r\n\r\nFinally be aware that different folks have different virus and spam
    filters that may interpret such emails and attachments as spam/viruses and your
    email may never reach the intended recipient."

  body: Please don't embed Flash into email. It's annoying enough when people send
    html emails. I use Eudora which is very bare bones and doesn't display the bells
    and whistles accurately, I like it that way. IMHO email should be plain text,
    with added jpeg or pdf graphics.

    multitude of email clients will be able to, or even care that you have flash embedded.\r\n\r\nDo
    put a link near the top of your marketing email along the lines of 'want the pretty
    bells and whistles version? click here...' which will take you to a web page formatted
    as you wish."
