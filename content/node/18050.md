  where i would specify a set of typefaces, size amplitude etc, and then the text
  would be randomized.\r\n\r\nthanks a lot\r\n\r\nhave been searching through google,
  but cant find anything.\r\n\r\nmaybe have to program myself, if there is no such
  product available?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nhardijs\r\nviskers(at)gmail.com"

      that lets say typefaces arial, tahoma, garamond would be used and bold,italic
      and size from 10 to 16 would be used by randomly applying these parameters to
      each letter of this paragraph.\\the outcome would look different size, weight
      and 3 different fonts.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nhardijs"
