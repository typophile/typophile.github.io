  body: "I wanted it to be a different answer than Friz Quadrata, but I do think that
    is the closest font I could find that might have been a starting point. It has
    been re-drawn to straighten edges (the N for example) and make the serifs more
    triangular. The R is completely new.\r\n\r\nThe best alternative I could find
    was Font Bureau's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/grand-central/|Grand
    Central]], which I could imagine being produced in an ultra weight that could
    look like this. It even has similar underlying R, E, and T shapes, but the C and
    A are a stretch (even if you were with me to this point).\r\n\r\nConsidering what
    I have just written, my answer would be \"custom, inspired by Friz Quadrata\".\r\n\r\n-

    Have you contacted the studio who did the poster?

    unique.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The main typeface used (title treatment, surnames, director
    credit) was Grant Avenue (Umbrella Type) and the secondary typeface was Hoefler
    Text with its beautiful swash italics.</em>"
