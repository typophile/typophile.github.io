<div class=commentbody>I hadn't heard of Victor Hammer. I had seen his fonts <br>before, though. American Uncial is fine; I just don't like <br>calligraphy fonts that much. I can't get over the random, <br>free shapes repeated over and over mechanically. It seems <br>like an oxymoron to me. Maybe as OpenType takes off they <br>will get better. <br> <br>Here is another PDF. I added some Roman Upper and Lower <br>case. The idea is that you can make it as uncial or not uncial <br>as you want. It's still rough; there are some weight issues <br>and some lumpy curves. <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Uncial New Sample 2<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/new_uncial_2-23775.pdf target=_blank><b>new_uncial_2.pdf</b></a> (45.6 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Christian. <br> <br>Lovely. Though I also confess I have never had a use for a unical font either. It would be a nice alternative in places where I've seen <a href=http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PMasSaR.html>Mason Sans & Serif</a> used. For <a href=http://www.artemisfowl.com/>example</a>. But this works much better in text situations. I bet you'd see a bundle of computer game manuals with this font! <br> <br>Unical a in the calligraphic version? <br> <br>R</div>

<div class=commentbody>Victor Hammer: my own first impression of him was that he was just an uncial freak. But some more exploration into his work revealed much serious thought that can really benefit any type designer to consider, especially one working on uncial. <br> <br>The idea of having an uncial/Latin pairing is superb. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The average graphic designer in general is very superficial in the use of type. That's why in the end they always end up using faces mostly for logotypes or to achieve a quick emotional effect. Many Emigre designs, abused as they are, aren't used at all in their full potential. Of course, overtly decorated letters dont' leave so much space for the typographer, but I'm sure interesting experiments (benefitting from OpenType, which is all to discover) like the one from Christian, here, will be overlooked and will make more the joy of type addicts and collectors instead of being used in actual interesting ways. <br>It's not to be pessimistic, but people tend to be very superficial, especially with historically inspired designs. <br> <br>Christian, did you really designed the first lowercases in a single night? If so, I'm just saddened to death (and very glad for you!): sometimes it takes me a whole afternoon to fix just a few letters...</div>

<div class=commentbody>It could be said of some human efforts, but certainly not all. <br>For example when somebody creates a painting, or a building, it is what it is, there is no abstraction. But a font is like a little machine, with parts (and I don't mean mere letterforms) that will never all be used by one person. Just the simple act of determining the right sidebearing of the "r" is more than any user can need [of itself]. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I have added a bold weight and all the punctuation, etc., and polished the characters. The spacing isn't done, and the bold is still a little wonky. I've worked a little more on the character mixing. I've set five different combinations here, but there are a lot of possibilities. I have worked out some OpenType features that will allow the different sets of characters to be turned on or off. Again, I wish that OpenType implementations would allow designers to define their own sets. InDesign currently doesn't have a "More Uncial" feature built into it, so I'm using the Titling, swash, and contextual alternates features. <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Complete Character Set<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/uncial_new-32102.pdf target=_blank><b>uncial_new.pdf</b></a> (40.8 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>It's super. I think the bowl of the d is fractionally too small, too. It may rather be that the curve into the stem is too steep (compare it with the curve on c, g, e) giving d the appearance of a rather small o with a stem. <br> <br>I think the superscript 1 may be a bit big (noticeable in the fractions). To my taste the os 3 is rather wide (especially compared to the 5, which is admirably narrow). But this may just be me: the modern taste in os figs often seems to me to produce rather overemphatic 3s.</div>
