  body: Hrant -- It seems like there are several that look similar. Are you thinking,
    perhaps, of Matthew&#39;s Helvetica Compressed? <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    target="_blank">Helvetica Inserat</a> and get a similar result.

  body: Why would anyone want to do <i>that</i>, Stephen? Gross. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    is it possible that the tail of the lowercase &#34;g&#34; of Haettenschweiler
    doesn&#39;t curl upwards like Impact&#39;s? <BR> <BR>BTW does anyone know if Tahoma
    is a Verdana lookalike, or is it just my browser that substitutes it for Verdana?

  body: i think tahoma is actually a condensed version of verdana...  <BR>probably
    they made it because in some sizes verdana looks too wide?  <BR>
