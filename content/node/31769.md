  body: I've heard others estimate between 150,000 and 200,000. Myfonts offers 52,000
    today, AF has another 10,000, so I suspect that those are very conservative estimates.
    I'd say at least an order of magnitude shy, to make up a number with no scientific
    backing.

  body: "Fonts Fonts = [[FontFont]]s?\r\n\r\nAre you asking how many <em>typefaces</em>
    exist or how many <em>fonts</em> exist? I hesitate to get into a longwinded discussion
    here about nomenclature (again!) but for the sake of your question:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>A
    [[typeface]] is a specific design of an alphabet. It usually refers to an entire
    typeface family, such as Palatino or Helvetica.</li><li>A [[font]] refers to the
    actual files which enable the typeface to be set <em>or</em> to an individual
    weight, width, or style of the typeface.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nThe number of digital
    typefaces in existence is difficult to estimate, but it's probably less than 50,000.
    The number of digital fonts is certainly greater than 100,000. (FontShop's database
    alone contains more than a hundred grand).\r\n\r\nThen, of course, you'd also
    have to specify whether you wish to count <em>all</em> typefaces or digital typefaces
    only. At this point you'll start to realize it's really too difficult a thing
    to count."

  body: "The exact number is, of course, irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThe sobering thought is
    that most typographers own thousands of typefaces, and use only a fraction of
    them the majority of the time.\r\n\r\nThe important thing to remember is that,
    like wine, while you probably only NEED a few varieties, there will always be
    new and vibrant examples created."
