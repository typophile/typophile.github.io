body: "I am updating an identity for my branding, design firm and I have recommended
  a switch in our corporate typeface. I am looking for a few suggestions which fit
  our criteria:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>capture the openness and friendliness of our current
  face (Century Gothic)</li>\r\n<li>with a more credible font that sets well and is
  part of a larger system (similar to Helvetica Neue, which some designers would like
  to see used)</li>\r\n<li>this larger system should include different weights, a
  nice italic, an expanded character set and solid numerals (distinct or non-lining
  figures would be a nice plus)</li>\r\n<li>we are also probably setting our name
  as a word-mark or initialed in this face, so it must have enough personality (or
  brand) to sit on its own</li></ul>\r\n\r\nSome designs that came to mind were: Verlag,
  Scala (both families), Dax, Neo Sans, Gotham, Whitney, or even Apex Sans and Galaxie
  Polaris.\r\n\r\nI know I've seen excellent suggestions on these boards. What do
  you guys think?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help,\r\n\r\nSam"

    body: "Great picks Miss Tiffany.\r\n\r\nI like Klavika (go Facebook!) and Locator
      (nice italics).\r\n\r\nBryant 2 is beautiful, but I'm not sure if we're ready
      to go 'all rounded' yet. The numbers really are wonderful, though.\r\n\r\nOverall,
      are there any picks that are a little safer, more friendly?\r\n\r\nTo me, Verlag
      was just nice, with a little character. The x-height makes it a little conspicuous
      and I think that keeps it from being perfect for our goals. The personality
      and sophistication, though, are right on."

  body: Verlag is a great typeface. I have had the opportunity to work with it and
    found it works very well at small sizes. However, because it is a geometric it
    will have moments of feeling stiff. The italic, for instance, isn't a soft as
    you might find in something else. But, on the other hand, your color palette,
    visuals, and other tactile elements will go a long way into imparting friendliness
    across the brand.

  body: "Those are great adnix. They both give Verlag a run for its money (in features
    and consistency) without the fussy x-height. They're both familiar and proprietary.
    That is no easy task.\r\n\r\nI love their numerals and special characters. We're
    considering a face called <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/evo-bq/'>Evo
    BQ</a>, which has an ampersand that almost takes the font out of contention. Look
    it up and see what I'm talking about!"
