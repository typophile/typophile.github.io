    but that is no go.

  body: "I'm not sure what it is either, the answer is definitely in the curved legs
    of the k and the chiseled ends of the s.\r\n\r\nOn a complete side note, I noticed
    Will that you did the Drew Kennedy logo. I hung out with Drew on a few occasions.
    What a small world. He used to play a few small bars around South Central PA before
    he left to make it big. That logo looks like the one he had before he left. You
    weren't from Hanover by any chance were you? "

    time. small world for sure. were you from that area?\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "yeah, I grew up in New Oxford, when there as well. I ran into Drew a few
    times, we had a mutual friend (Chris Kershaw). Also, you might remember another
    guy, Sam Juergens. He and I work together for a consulting firm here in Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nWhere'd
    you go for college? You have some really cool pieces in your portfolio, are you
    a screen printer as well? Have you been in Chi-town long?"

  body: "thanks for the kind words on the work. i knew sam as well. cool guy. almost
    everyone i knew back there i lost touch with after i moved to chicago. i went
    to school in sarasota, FL. small art school called ringling school of art and
    design. about 1,000 students give or take. hell of an education. i moved up here
    in spring 02 with a couple buddies from college and did some freelance for a few
    years since the economy was crap. found a couple full time deisgn gigs and now
    i'm at a small firm called firebelly as senior designer. great place. good work
    for good causes too. most of my stuff lately has been in type. really trying to
    develop a lettering thing and get some font creation happening. slow so far but
    time is scarce. \r\n\r\nnew oxford. crazy. i didnt think anyone from that area
    would give a rat's ass about type..\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "I don't think to many people give a crap about much from there either, especially
    type. I guess I'm an exception to the rule. \r\n\r\nSounds like things are going
    well for you. It's good to see a local doing well at anything art related, Hanover
    definitely was NOT the cultural mecca we all hoped it would be. I spent a lot
    of time in Baltimore when I was in HS, hoping to get some exposure to anything.
    \r\n\r\nFlorida sounds like a popular destination for designer from this area
    as well. I knew another kid from Gettysburg that went to Full Sail for 3D design.
    He's now doing web work in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nI'd like to move on, Harrisburg isn't
    much of a mecca either.  I started a thread about it (a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/32853\">Design
    Limbo</a>) so I won't go into much detail. \r\n\r\nI'll pass the word on to Sam
    you said Hi, I think he still talks to Drew so I'm sure he'll say something.\r\n\r\nNice
    meeting you, keep up the good work. \r\n"

  body: I thought it might be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/galapagos/extreme-sans/">Extreme
    Sans</a>, that rip-off of Platelet -- yup, Alex Kaczun <em>again</em> --  but
    nope. I <em>have</em> seen this one before though. :^/

    Vasava fonts.

  body: <a href=http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/44>Reflex</a> has similarities, if you
    replace the lc 'y' with UC like in Sudtipos example of "andy wharhol".

  body: Sorry for warming up this one year old thread, but it looks like VSV Melon
    as Angel remarked. Got a typespecimen from <a href="http://www.typografie.info/typoforum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5161&p=40389">this
    german thread</a> today. Just wanted to share this as Vasava Fonts are quite rare
    these days. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/VSV_Melon_6411.jpeg]
