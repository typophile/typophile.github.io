  of completely redoing someones bike, i suggested custom lettering of whatever they
  wanted but they insisted on it being as close to the original as possible.  I inverted
  the colors so the font is more vibrant.  I can get a new picture this is the only
  one i have available to me at this moment."

  body: That works for just about everything except "Mt" and the "T".  Any suggestions?
    I'm sure a different font was probably used for "Mt" or could it be they only
    used the "S" from Insignia Alt.?

    different font that doesn\u2019t fit to Insignia. I\u2019d make that the same."
