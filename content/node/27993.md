    I'd have to check the MS character set, because this uses the alternate S, which

    that way, but at least with Illustrator I cannot get that to 'fill'. The font
    was drawn as an outline. When you reverse 'stroke' and 'fill' you just get a darker
    outline.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    to curves, break the curves apart, then manually delete everything you don't want.
    It would take some time, but you could potentially get only the inside of Desdemona.\r\n\r\n
    - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. Just thought of a slightly faster way - convert the text to
    curves, draw a big rectangle around everything, combine all the objects together,
    break it apart, delete the big rectangle, then delete all the shapes within the
    counters.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Whoops - that wouldn't work."

    apparent stroke thickness. Whew! Thanks for the tutorial Lex. I'm done with this
