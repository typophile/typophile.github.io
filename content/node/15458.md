body: "Hello to all,\r\n\r\nI am currently designing a font, but I am stuck into a
  dilemma. Hopefully somebody can shed some light onto it.\r\n\r\nEverything has been
  done inside a PC. I generated the glyphs inside Corel Draw and then exported them
  to ttf. So far, so good. The file just needed some kerning and some proper layouting
  so all the glyphs lay on the correct Unicode squares inside FontLab.\r\n\r\nFirst,
  after a few -successful- exports of the file done in order to check the progress
  of the font, the resulting ttf file would not open: \"not a valid file\". OK, so
  I exported to .otf and things went fine. \r\n\r\nI am not yet finished, but why
  is it that the exported .otf file behaves so differently in the programmes I have
  tested it with?\r\n. Inside InDesign (CS2) the leading looks too squashed down and
  it appears that the font is misplaced along the baseline (see image: the black lines
  show selected text, which should normally be covered all in black, not just a part
  of it). \r\n\r\n. Inside Corel Draw (12), the font looks just OK, but the space
  between words vanish completely, so I end up with some boustrophedon-like text.
  Even if I manually enter extra spaces, they won't show, as if the space glyph had
  0-value sidebearings. (image)\r\n\r\n- Inside MS Word (XP), the font looks with
  decent leading, decent inter word spacing, although horribly displayed on screen
  (image).\r\n\r\n-When exported to PDF inside each programme, the ones from InDesign
  and Word look OK, but the one from Corel won't show the interword spaces still (see
  other images).\r\n\r\nAll of the graphic samples are taken with default leading/kerning
  for each programme. Kerning & leading processes are not yet finished in FontLab.\r\n\r\nSo
  how can I correct all this? Why does it look like I have got three different fonts,
  depending on which software I use? Normally Word does a horrible task at displaying
  fonts, but InDesign & Corel make a beautiful font rendering & typesetting. I suppose
  the issue resides on how I am handling the font inside FontLab, but that's why I
  am asking for advice.\r\n\r\n................\r\n\r\nAnd a couple more questions:\r\n\r\nHow
  does one increase/decrease the leading from a font inside FontLab?\r\n\r\nAny comments/suggestions
  on the overall look of the font? It is supposed to lightly convey a flair of Spain
  during the XVI Century, but with a fresher look to it. It will be used for the making
  of a book.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have got a dateline for this project, and I still have to
  export the italic version, so the hastier the answers, the better.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot,\r\nMosh"

    on typophile. The issues you raise are very complex, and on the whole unanswerable
    since there are so many variables in the formating of font files.\r\nA slightly
    better forum would be the fontlab user group on msn, but i wouldn't expext much
    there either, we (type designers/fontlab users)all have to slowly glean what information
    we can in the various forums and tutorials, along with a good dose of trial and
    error, until it works the way we want it to."

    we (respectfully, of course) prove Miles incorrect here? Let's try and give Viejo
    some advice\u2026\r\n\r\nViejo, I'm a novice at font design and production, and
    I have never, ever worked with Correll Draw, but I'll do my best here.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know what to suggest about inter-word spacing. I would try to set the space
    glyph right inside FontLab. Somehow, I don't trust Correll\u2026\r\n\r\nThe leading
    has something to do with the Em Square, and the length of your ascenders and descenders.
    A font does not have real \"leading values,\" nor can that be set or reset in
    FontLab, other than by changing letter proportions inside of the Em-Square's grid.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason that your font displays so poorly inside MS Word is most likely because
    it is not hinted, or it has been auto-hinted (and that auto-hinting wasn't adequate).
    In order to get your font to display nicely onscreen in MS-Word, it'll have be
    superbly hinted (mean TrueType Delta hinting, I guess). That is hard work that
    is not normally done on display faces (and your faces seems to be more in the
    display direction than strictly \"text.\" I don't mean this in a negative way!)\r\n\r\nTo
    get a Design crit, try posting PDFs of your design\u2014with text settings\u2014in
    the Critique forums. I'm going to make your thread title more direct, and bump
    it to the Typophile home page to see if you can get any better tips than mine!"

    height of the Caps, ascenders and x-height. What is the depth of your descenders?
    Do you have an actual space character defined in FontLab? You said you exported
    ttf in Corel. Do you have actual TrueType outlines in FontLab, and are the path
    directions set correctly?\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "<a>How does one increase/decrease the leading from a font inside FontLab?</a>\r\n\r\nThis
    has to do with you vertical metrics. Hopefully the wiki entry called [[Vertical
    Metrics How-To]] can help you understand that a bit more. When I've exported invalid
    font files, it usually has to do with the fact that i haven't filled out all the
    naming information, but i suppose there are other problems that chould be the
    culprits. Have you tried running you font through Microsoft's [[Font Validator]]?"

      not reply.\r\n\r\nThis is my first time using FontLab for exporting type and
      I am somehow confused.\r\n\r\nI had edited the space glyph inside FL so it would
      be a little wider, but it is strange that this glyph behaves OK inside Word
      & ID and not in CorelDraw (and Corel works normally OK).\r\n\r\nI will post
      a screenshot tomorrow of the ascender/descender stuff. I am still not used to
      manipulate these in order to get proper leading. I will also give the UPM I
      am using tomorrow, since I have no FL installed in this computer.\r\n\r\nPaul:
      No, I have not run my font through MS's Font Validator. What does it do for
