<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Generally, I'm interested in typography. Professionally, I'm a software programmer. Privately, I am, among (a few) other things, a lover of design with typography near the top of the list of favorite design disciplines. I'd been searching for a specific book for the better part of a year, when a friend suggested I look for a forum discussing typography to ask experts and enthusiasts my question: <br> <br>Is there such a book (or, hopefully, books) which look at: <br> <br>- How cultural, social, economic, political trends have impacted the use of existing typefaces and design of new typefaces, and <br>- Conversely, how uses of existing and new typefaces have, through the course of history, affected communication and expression, and impacted greater cultural, social, economic, political trends? <br> <br>My interest is pretty broad: a historical account, a contemporary analysis, theory. I'd be interested in a couple of other related topics, such as the crosstalk between typography and other design disciplines, or at what time and in which contexts were specific design elements and forms in specific glyphs or whole typefaces introduced. <br> <br>A rather broad description. Any hits in the vicinity would be appreciated, as is your patience to simply read this post. <br> <br>Much thanks, <br>KLS</div>

<div class=commentbody>I hope people who are more book-savvy (like Tiffany) will help you out, I'd just like to point out a very interesting -but hard to find- book that illustrates tangible parallels between type and art/architecture: <br> <br>"The letter as a work of art; observations and confrontations with contemporaneous expressions of art from Roman times to the present day.", by G Knuttel, 1951. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>K, <br> <br>Not exactly what you are looking for, but Steve Heller's <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0714839272/speakup-20 target=_blank>Merz to Emigre and Beyond: Avant-Garde Magazine Design of the Twentieth Century</a> presents a really good case for the importance of design in the advancement and representation of avant garde groups. <br> <br>I was about to go on a long explanation, but you can read <a href=http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/001686.html target=_blank>a review I wrote on it on my site</a>. (Sorry for the blatant self-promotion).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here's another: <br>The Visible Word : Experimental Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923, by Johanna Drucker <br> <br>I was reminded of it by Armin's post -- like Heller, Drucker attaches great importance to the publications of early 20th C art movements. She also argues that the integration of text into (some) modern art which occurred at that time subsequently went missing, with the unfortunate result that Post WW2 modernism, especially the NY school, slipped into a polarized void, with critics supplying all the words, and the art becoming a dumb, shallow, conceptual second fiddle. <br>Anyway, that's how I remember the book from reading it a few years ago, so she might actually have said something quite different. </div>

<div class=commentbody>May be worth investigating- <br> <br>Jessica Helfand: <br>:Screen :Essays on Graphic Design, New Media and Visual Culture or <br>six essays on design and new media <br> <br>Lawson's Anatomy of a Typeface (more historical) <br> <br>and there are also some interesting articles in <br> <br>& Lift and Separate:Graphic Design and the Vernacular Barbara Glauber <br> <br>Nick-really enjoy the essays on your site... <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>K.Lo -- I'm not saying a book doesn't exist for your topic. But I will say that it sounds like you have a great idea for a potential thesis. -- I'm not sure you will find a book with your wishes directly. I might start by finding books with excellent bibliographies and branch out in those directions. I think you will find that you are going to have to form many of the connections on your own. <br> <br>I wonder if you might find something or someone from the University of Reading -- <a href=http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/ target=_blank>http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/</a> -- that might share your interests, Simon Eliot has done research involving economics and the history of printing. He might be a good lead. Dig around their site, they list all of the staff's research in bibliographic form. <br> <br>I'll keep my eyes open. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>On a side note "Typography Papers 5" has been released. If ever there were five publications necessary to a serious typophile (with interests too broad to saddle) it would be these. <br></div>
