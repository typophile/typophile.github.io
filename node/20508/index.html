<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>[[Cyrillic]] glyphs have names just like any other script. If I create a [[Greek]] font, alpha is the name of the first letter, not a code. I am not a Russian speaker and have a hard time going back and forth between the glyph name, unicode number, what the glyph looks like, and the so-called glyph name afii_thing. Is there a reason why they can't just use the real glyph names just as they do in Latin and Greek? I feel like I need a Rossettastone to tell me what I am looking at.

<div class=commentbody><p>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a> a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href=http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a> Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</p><p></p><p>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href=http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a> and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href=http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a> ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a> future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </p><p></p><p>In order <a href=http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a> to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href=http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a> then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </p><p></p></div>

<div class=commentbody>hi chris,
probably not completely what you're looking for, but for a start:
<a href=http://www.decodeunicode.org/>decodeunicode.org</a>
the single pages referring to the resp. unicode blocks (greek + coptic, cyrillic + cyrillic supplement) are nicely hidden to the left of that double dotted line :-)
hope this helps at least a bit.

Not for me (on a Mac). That's why I had to write my own.
In addition, my script does not require the renaming files to be in a specific folder, to have a specific extension, or to have a specific header. All it requires is a text file with two columns of names separated by white space (can be 1 or several space characters or tab entries).</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's implicit in many of the comments, files and links, but I didn't see anybody come out and say it. So, for other readers who are not as familiar with this stuff:
You can of course use whatever glyph names you like for your own internal (production) usage. But when generating the final font, the afii names from the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts are preferable so that they will be recognized by potential consumers of the font.
Cheers,
T

<div class=commentbody>I have Russian on tape, Russian on CD, three different books, and a wife from Azerbaijan who's first language is Russian and I currently know only about 40 Russian words... so I guess it has more to do with how disciplined and persistent you are than what (or how many) learning tools you have... at this rate my month old daughter will quickly know more Russian than me. Sometimes I feel like Koko the gorilla, counting and tracking how many words I know... though at this point I think Koko knows over 1000 signs and over 2000 spoken words, so I am way behind in comparison in Russian...lol</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello
This is my first comment on typophile.
i am now finishing my MD at type & media kabk the hague.

I am working on Arabic typefaces and I have the same problem that is mentioned conserning the naming of the glyphs. It could be very annoying while in the stage of designing your font to keep using the affixxx naming.
What i did is that i made my own incoding ( 1. modified the agl.nam in the mapping folder of fontlab. 2. added my personal encoding .enc file in the encoding folder of fontlab) file in the with my own naming for my font.
I use this encoding during the design process, but when it comes to generating the font, i
made a script using Robofab that changes all my personal names back to unixxx before generation. I can also do it to change the names back to affixxx.
The nice think about that is only have to do this naming and encoding stuff once, and then you will use it always and the design process will be much more friendly.
Ok
cheers

<div class=commentbody>well here is my script that i use.
it does not need any glyph name list file to refer to.
it transforms all the names to uni + the unicode number it has.
it only works if you want the glyph names to be in unixxxx.
---------------------------------
#FLM: Glyph name to uni pascal
#pascal zoghbi
from robofab.world import CurrentFont
f = CurrentFont()
for g in f:
uni = g.unicode
if uni:
unicode = "%X" %uni
name = g.name
lastBit = ""
numberOfZero = 4-len(unicode)
if name.count("."):
k, lastBit = name.split(".")
lastBit = "." + lastBit
uni = "uni" + "0"*numberOfZero + unicode + lastBit
g.name = uni
f.update()
-------------------------------
i do not know yet how to attach files.
so only copy and past the script and it will work.
Maybe you need to insert the tabs again properly if when copying and pasting the tabs were removed or so.
can someone tell me how can a attach file which are not images.
ok

<div class=commentbody>As a matter of fact, a large number of cyrillic glyphs have historical long names, following greek tradition. These are widely used by linguists and known to educated speakers of slavonic languages. The same names are used for Glagolythic alphabet, which is different from cyrillic in glyph shapes only. Details can be found on Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glagolitic_alphabet. I believe these names work better as glyph names because there are less conflicts with greek (Fita =/= Theta) and latin (On =/= O, Uk =/= U).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris, to address your background question: The Greek alphabet is essentially used to write a single language, so transliterated letter names can be used for glyphs without causing problems for developers who might call them something else. The Cyrillic script, on the other hand, is used to write more than fifty languages, and not all of them call the letters by the same names or even use them to signify the same phonemes. So codes are better for standard glyph names. That said, I use the uniXXXX form names for Cyrillic letters, not the old afii codes, since they are a bit easier to remember once one knows the Unicode set, are more efficient in terms of font size, and save me from keeping track of two different code naming conventions. You would only need to use afii names in Type 1 fonts with some pretty ancient software.
I use transliterated glyph names largely based on modern Russian names during production, and switch to the uniXXXX names for the post/CFF table entries. My Cyrillic production names are preceded by c. as a script indicator, which distinguishes e.g. Cyrillic c.A from Latin A.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris,
I second John's explanation. A simple example: in Russian, afii10068 (U+0433) is pronounced "g" (like in "good") but in Ukrainian, this letter is used to write a dark "h" sound (something like in "hat") while "g" is written using afii10098 (U+0491). There are other situations like that. A similar issue can be made between the Hebrew and the Arabic script. The Hebrew letters are practically used to write only one language so one could theoretically use "descriptive" transliterated names for the Hebrew glyphs, especially that the Hebrew letters have actual names (e.g. "aleph"). But the Arabic script is used to write many different languages of the world and the heavily diacritic structure of the script makes descriptive names at least illogical -- you end up with names like "dotless beh", which make little sense because you're mixing visual and phonetical elements.

<div class=commentbody>Excuse me for bumping the old thread, but what exactly would happen if I output a font with non afii00xx glyph names? I'm testing my multilingual sans serif and it looks like it works fine as long as glyphs occupy their proper unicode values... I've generated an .otf, installed it and nothing seems to be broken in any applications (InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Word, browsers) on both Mac and Windows.
I have renamed Cyrillic glyphs to my preference (Acyr, Becyr, etc.). After all we rename the glyphs in PUA to our preference. And I have some Ukrainian ligatures like yicyr_yicyr that would look strange if it was afii10104_afii10104
Am I doing something wrong? What can hypothetically break? I guess that political issues (like transliteration) are not the case because in 99,9% cases, the user won't ever see actual glyph names, only the glyphs themselves.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The only real reason is that in some corner cases with OpenType CFF fonts, encoding must be inferred from glyph names alone. Mostly this occurs when the font is printed to a PostScript file, and then that file is turned into a PDF. If the glyph names are not recognized by the PDF creator, the PDF will look correct, and print fine, but the underlying text will either not be present, or be incorrect.
afii names are not the only option, however. You can use uniXXXX names instead.
Or you can decide that this is an unlikely or irrelevant corner case and ignore the issue.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It’s not the PDF creator, but the workflow. Simply:
Use an OTF font.
Print a PS file to disk instead of to a device.
De-activate the fonts
Make sure that your PDF creating software doesn’t know where the fonts are.
Create your PDF.
Open the PDF and see that everything looks right. However, copy-paste, search and so forth don’t work worth beans.
You can use Acrobat Distiller or anything else. It doesn’t matter at that point. I am not even convinced there is any need to test this—it is a pretty well-known and longstanding issue. It’s the main reason anybody cares about glyph names in the final, produced font. If you have a PS OpenType font (.otf), use completely non-standard names, and the original font is unavailable to the PDF creator, this <em>will</em> happen.
That said, obviously it is a corner case, for most purposes. So you may choose to ignore it, your call.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, that gets more complicated.
IF the driver is set to send the TT font as TrueType to the PostScript device, then nothing can go wrong, and incorrect or even completely absent glyph names should not cause a problem. This is because the entire TT font, including the cmap table, gets put in the PostScript print stream.
If the driver is set to do something else, well, it depends on what that something else is....
Note that my knowledge of this particular print scenario with TT to PS devices is quite a few years old. It may be that all modern drivers behave one way or another and I don't know about it. I don't have a PS printer set up right now to mess around with this; it could vary by driver/platform/moon-phase.
Well, okay, probably not by phase of the moon. :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>One thing I'm curious about is why Adobe has never actually remedied this since it would avoid a lot of headaches associated with CFF opentype fonts. Apart from the inconvenience of being forced to use the rather non-intuitive names defined by the AGL discussed in this thread, we are stuck with the need to duplicate certain glyphs (e.g. small capitals), to avoid various double-encodings which would simplify some fonts, etc. all to satisfy the limitations of a single program (Acrobat), and only in a fairly limited number of cases.
If Adobe were to update their PostScript drivers to embed cmap data into postscript files and distiller to make use of such data, these would all become non-issues.
The syntax adopted for including cmaps could use % delimiters, in which case older software would assume they were simply dealing with a lengthy comment and ignore the new data which would help ensure backwards compatibility with existing applications.</div>

<div class=commentbody>People use old software sometimes. The issue would not go away for many years even if Adobe did update their PostScript drivers. Plus, one often hears that if people want to make the best and most reliable PDFs, they should be made with the source fonts available.
I started to write that still, it was not a bad idea, but then I thought about it more....
One problem is, it is not just the cmap. That is fine for one-to-one mappings of default glyphs, but not for alternates, ligatures, etc. There is all sorts of stuff that does not cover.
So for full reliability, you'd need to inject a LOT more info into the print stream. Possibly the rest of the font (the part beyond the CFF table), and that rest not subsetted down to just the glyphs used in printing. This would make for a much fatter and slower print stream, so it couldn't be on by default, because the normal users who just want to print can't get hit with a big performance penalty.
In which case, you would be in exactly the same boat as today, that sometimes things would go wrong, as long as people make PDFs from print streams. Even in a perfect future where that fatter print stream was an option.
I expect this is why it was never done. :(</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK. I see your points. However, I still think its a bit annoying that unicode fonts should be perpetually hampered by the fact that PS Type 1 fonts predate unicode (which is essentially where the PDF problem stems from). Another option would be to create a postscript driver which embeds the underlying character stream (at least when writing to a file rather than an actual printer), but I don't know enough about printing architecture to know if that's even possible. Even if it took years before the problem went away, it would at least become less and less of an issue over time.
I vacillate back and forth on the issue of whether I should adopt Adobe's strategy of ensuring that glyphs can be uniquely mapped back to characters or not. Having separate glyphs for (e.g.) A.sc and a.sc or onesuperior and one.sups isn't a big deal for simple fonts, but if you have a large character set and/or lots of alternate glyphs kerning becomes more complicated and the glyph window starts getting rather cluttered.
Also there are some cases (albeit not that many) where descriptive glyphs names might be useful for the end user. Pi fonts come immediately to mind -- Adobe Carta uses names like 'lookout' which are far more informative than 'uniE041' would be (though admittedly the ability to reconstruct PUA codepoints isn't exactly crucial since they're not meaningful unless you're using some standard like MUFI which fonts on the users system also adhere to).

<div class=commentbody>Adobe won't even put a glyph palette in Photoshop or properly UI Stylistic Sets, why would they give a tinkers damn about fixing this? Adobe died and morphed into Quark. They just don't care about type users or designers.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think talking about Adobe as a single monolithic entity is a mistake. :)
It is a big company. It has different teams with different priorities, and their handling of things that are other than massive company priorities will differ. This is normal, albeit unfortunate, for any big company.
For the kinds of issues under discussion, pretend there is no “Adobe,” but rather a PostScript printers and driver team, an Acrobat team, a Photoshop team, a type team, and so on. This maps more closely to the way things actually work, in my experience.
Of course there is discussion and cross-pollination. But the silo effect is pretty huge.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The issue about PDF creation isnt’t about Adobe. PDF is an ISO standard, and there are dozens of OSes, libraries and apps which create PDFs directly, using their own software:
— Quartz, the OS X graphic subsystem
— Ghostscript, a popular opensource package
— Qt, a cross-platform application development kit
— Cairo, an opensource graphic rendering subsystem
— Apache PDFBox
— libHaru
— Apache FOP
— GnuPDF
— Global Graphics
and many more.
PDF documents are written directly, or through an intermediate PostScript file, from desktop applications on various OSes but also from various libraries that are used on various web frameworks. PDF creation libraries are available in a large number of programming languages: C#/.NET, C++, C, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and others (in each of these languages, there is a large number of libraries available).
Hell, even some photocopiers allow you to scan a document, OCR it and save it as a PDF to a USB stick.
Since font embedding has always been a fairly complex issue, some of these libraries have solved it in as simple way as only possible.
All kinds of versions of these libraries are deployed on all kinds of devices, websites, server software, desktop apps etc. on different OSes worldwide. A fair number of these doesn’t even support OTF at all (just TTF), others support OTF but have gone a simple shortcut and treat them the same way as Type 1 (or more specifically, they just extract the CFF table from the OTF font file and put it directly into the PDF, without any parsing or subsetting, because it actually is the simplest way — but the only thing that at that time gets written into the PDF is the CFF table which relies on glyph names only.
So no matter what Adobe would do, it won't "fix the problem". Seriously — how many of you OS X users out there regularly use Adobe Acrobat to create PDF files, rather than using the PDF creation built-in into OS X? That PDF creation is not Adobe's, that's Apple's. And it's severely limited, too. :)
Best,
Adam</div>
