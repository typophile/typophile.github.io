  and based on the accusation of my peers, a \"font bigot\".  \r\n\r\nI'm going to
  be starting a blog on the quirky built environment and culture of the Buffalo area,
  with a \"Stuff Buffalonians like\" tag inspired by \"Stuff White People Like\".
  \ Among the things that Buffalonians like is the Brush Script typeface.  Not just
  \"like\", but more like \"love\".  \r\n\r\nCompared to other parts of the United
  States and Canada where I've lived or visited, Brush Script is unbelievably popular
  here in the Buffalo area.  It's a very common sight on signs, in company logos,
  on vehicles belonging to both small and large businesses, and in advertising.  Several
  auto dealers use it for their logos.  The upscale suburb of Amherst uses it on their
  Web site.  While in other parts of the country, I've seen Brush Script used to project
  a kitschy or 1950-ish feel, its use in the Buffalo area is completely without irony.
  \ \r\n\r\nWhat Gill Sans is to London, Mistral to Montreal (based on what I saw
  in an old Flickr group), and Papyrus to Austin, Brush Script is to Buffalo.  Are
  there other typefaces that seem like local or regional favorites?  Why would Brush
  Script be so popular in the city that is the home of the P22 foundry? "

    of the Lexus logo typeface. I'm guessing a signmaker in the area uses it as his
    default font.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
