body: "Hello.\r\nThe Textfont from \"Elle Decoration\" looks like a Baskerville, but
  I am not sure which one. I think it is not the Baskerville from the Berthold Foundry
  and not the one from ITC. Mmmh, with the ITC I am not sure, but maybe somebody have
  an idea. Would be great. Best, Michael"

    body: "Thanks, but isn\xB4t the ITC from Bitstream? The \"myfonts.com\" says it.
      I am not a Specialist at all, but sometimes I really think that a lot of ITC
      Stuff has realyy a bad quality in Kerning. Best, Michael"
