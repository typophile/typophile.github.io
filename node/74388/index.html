  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,

I have to ask for a help as this issue is bothering me for a long time now.
I have made a logo for my activity as a motion designer. It is in the style of sign-painted logos, like "Dodgers" baseball team, Cadillac, or maybe some House Industries Sign Painter or similar genre.
The idea came through because I wanted to put the accent on well skilled small design studio, rather than big post-production or design agency. This is all ok and I am pretty happy with it. 

The things usually become complicated when you have to design something for yourself and my big problem is matching the logo with the right typeface. The logo seem to be not so friendly with different typefaces.

I thought I can go for something that will contrast hand-painted nature of the logo... something like Lineto Bitmap 1 so it can clearly say that it is activity connected to the screen. It actually looks nice on screen, but it I am really not satisfied when it comes to the print.
In the print I would go for something like Franklin Gothic Condensed in different weights. This one seems to fit the logo, but does not work so good on screen and I'm afraid it is too much classic.

I'm not sure... I'd like to avoid using different typeface just because of different medium. Is there any typeface that can match both, have a screen aspiration in it, and still be very elegant in print... can still match something like sign-painter logo? 
Am I making too much problems out of nothing?
Please help.

Thanks,
Ced</div>

Yes and no: you are talking about your visual identity, so it's important, but the problem isn't insoluble.

Since it sound like your logo could be called "Classic," your typeface choice ought to be Classic too, complementing rather than competing with the "bug." As you note, typefaces that look good in print don't always look good on screen, but that problem can be solved with faces that have a wide range of weights, such as Futura. The light version could be used for print, and the book version--slightly beefier, but still noticeably lightish--could be used for print.

Alternately, if you want a little more style, but a classic feel and a LOT of weight choices, you might check this out...

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Oldnick,

Thanks a lot for your advice, especially about complementing.
I like how the extra condensed Proxima Nova sits with the logo and I like its readability at the small sizes. I love fat and light weights independently. I will definitely consider it for my identity.

Thanks again,
Ced
