  of Basilea"> <BR> <BR>Hey guys, Typophile has solved all my problems in the past,
  so I have no doubt this one will be cracked quickly as well. <BR> <BR>I guess this
  is not essentially an identification request, but I am looking to use a typeface
  for a project, and I want to purchase it for my client. The problem is that I have
  the typeface but I cannot find any place that offers it for sale. <BR> <BR>The type
  is called &#34;Basilea&#34; and/or &#34;BasileaFont&#34; and I know it was formerly
  distributed by Image Club. The only hit I get from Google is this: <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/ICG.txt"
  target="_blank">http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/ICG.txt</a> &#40;a list of Image Club
  Graphics fonts&#41;. <BR> <BR>As you probably know, Image Club no longer exists,
  and while the Image Club Typeface Library is available through Fonts.com, they do
  not have it in their collection online.  <BR> <BR>Any ideas or suggestions are highly
  appreciated!'

    esteemed authority in everything Image Club  - resides  <BR>in a timezone which
    is currently in sleepytime mode.

  body: Folkert, Basliea was one of the several hundred typefaces that I personally
    expunged from the Image Club library for &#39;technical quality&#39; reasons back
    in 1998. That&#39;s not to say that the face wasn&#39;t usable, it just wasn&#39;t
    up to the current technical specifications and typographic standards that I had
    set in place for the newer releases. <BR> <BR>The only place you&#39;ll find Basilea
    these days is on a old copy of Image Club&#39;s LetterPress disc. I have several
    LetterPress 7.0 CDs in my software archive, which are for sale. Contact me through
    my <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view_profile&amp;profile=grant-users">profile</a>
    if you&#39;re interested in following up. <BR> <BR>Cheers.

  body: If you don't hold a license for a font, or how it landed on your computer
    is questionable, chances are you shouldn't use it and you most certainly shouldn't
    be passing it along to other people. (Even if it was licensed properly, most/all
    foundries do not allow sharing their fonts.) If the designer still holds the rights
    to the design it is well within their rights to not allow a digital version of
    the font to be made.
