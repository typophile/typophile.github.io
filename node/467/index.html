		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. Sorry to contradict, guys, but that sans doesn't  <BR>look like Metro to me. Granted, it's a small sample. But  <BR>the tail of the Metro g continues further around the  <BR>curve, and so does the top of the a; the Metro s has  <BR>a more closed aperture top and bottom; the Metro w is  <BR>slightly narrower and quite idiosyncratic, with unequal  <BR>interior and exterior angles; and the overall x-height  <BR>of Metro is proportionately a little larger. <BR> <BR>This looks more like an import to me. I'm thinking  <BR>probably Erbar. Unfortunately, there are no good online  <BR>samples, as there has not yet been a digitization of the  <BR>original Erbar, not that I'm aware of. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Funny, I thought we were trying to ID the masthead font but then I noticed all these posts about Metro and figured out everybody was shooting for the teeny little font below it. <BR> <BR>Regarding the masthead, it could be Coronet but the cap 'T' is so home rolled, I wonder if it's a one off job that somebody did a while back to slightly alter Coronet - That 'D' is unmistakable. <BR> <BR>Now regarding the font below, I got another chuckle since it so closely matches my Lionel Family which was inspired by lettering I found in an old Lionel Train repair manual. I'm attaching a sample for your consideration. It's my first serious text face and I'm quite fond of it. <BR> <BR>Upon a critique by Matthew Carter, he insisted there was no reason for this font to exist because Futura already existed :D <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12264.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">(Insert sound of exasperation here) <BR> <BR>Sure, while the Lionel lower-case bears a lot of similarity to Futura, the upper-case and numerals have a very distinctive (and pleasant) personality. <BR> <BR>And perusing Matthew Carter's faces, especially the slight differences between <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/new-century-schoolbook/">New Century Schoolbook</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/">Miller</a>, I think what we have here is a slight case of the pot calling the kettle derivative.</div>

Mac's book, American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century, is an Oak Knoll publication, still available, case bound and perfect bound.
