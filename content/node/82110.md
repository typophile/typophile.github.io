body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been wondering about the following: It used to be recommended
  to use Postscript T1 for print production (rather than truetype, I guess?). Would
  you use TT for print production, and if not, why? \r\n\r\nWith the dawn of opentype
  I don't know if this is still valid. There still is postscript (PST1) and truetype
  (TT) but now there is Open Type TTF and OTF as well. Opentype, as I understand it,
  is basically an enhanced truetype format, with either postscript or truetype outlines.
  \r\n\r\nBut does that mean that OTF (postscript outlines) is still better suited
  for print production than TTF (truetype outlines)? What relevent differences are
  there, both in print as on screen?\r\n\r\nTHX Jeffrey"

    TT might offer better hinting, but only if the font is equipped with it. It also
    depends heavily on the render methods. Which OS? Which kind of subpixel rendering?
    Typophile.com has countless of threads on these subjects. "

    I'm not a webdesigner screenhinting is not as important to me as printing quality.
    I have some older PST1 fonts that are quite badly hinted (I use Mac OSX, 1024x768
    screen), like ITC Mendoza, which show all kinds of strangle line deformations,
    especially in the horizontal strokes. This might be slightly annoying when working
    on a document on screen, but as long as I know the printing quality is good, this
    is a minor quibble."

    what you say goes by the premise that quadratic beziers were derived by converting
    cubic beziers, which does not say anything about formats as such. Working with
    quadratic beziers right away you can get away with just as few points.\r\n\r\nQueneau
    -- <cite>ITC Mendoza</cite>\r\n\r\nIssues are font-specific, not format-specific.
    (Referring to a very old version: As to outlines, some extra points are caused
    by conversion from IK to bezier curves. As to hinting, a few letters seem to have
    oddly placed hints. Both shouldn't matter in print, though.) Still one of my favorite
    typefaces."

    to do with the format of the type.  Some of the very old RIPs may not handle today's
    opentype fonts well but you should choose an output vendor with modern equipment
    for many reasons.

  body: If your final output is outlines, then there is no more distinction, they
    both will be postscript outlines but the outlines may differ in point placement
    and number.  It is far easier to draw in postscript type 1 outline format than
    it is for truetype so there is no need for thinking about truetype unless hinting
    is the main concern.  When you convert to outlines, all hinting is lost.

    have many postscript fonts and they work fine for me, it's just a bit more work.
    It seems that with the opentype format fonts come with a lot more bells and whistles,
    which can be understood in a competitive market. But this is not a guarantee for
    quality. It is certainly easier to implement a lot of these features, but i've
    seen many commercial OT fonts that have poorly designed weights, bad diacritics,
    poor spacing and kerning.\r\n\r\nSo better font formats don't neccesarily produce

    more user friendly, better interface, less likely to clutter up, less susceptible

  body: "Interesting. The last time I saw a TrueType font stall a RIP was in the mid-1990s,
    however the experience was bad enough to prejudice me against the format for some
    time. The job crashed the RIP so badly, we lost hours of valuable production time,
    and it reinforced the (then-widespread) company policy to specify PostScript Type
    1 fonts only in client-supplied work, whether they were application files, postscript
    or .pdf files. In my subsequent teaching practice I would recommend PostScript
    Type 1 as a more reliable font format overall, until as late as 2004 (I even had
    a classroom diagram like Janek's). \r\n\r\nWith the arrival of better RIP technologies,
    .pdf workflows in pre-press and OpenType (both varieties) this distinction for
    print purposes has become irrelevant, although I think most font developers now
    prefer the hinting offered by the TrueType flavour of OpenType for onscreen display.
    Certainly this is what I understand from reading the literature of companies like
    Dalton Maag.  "
