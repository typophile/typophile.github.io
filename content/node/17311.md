  and enthusiasts alike, against the thin, wispy text faces that characterize most
  of today's digital type. \r\n\r\nThe weapons in our arsenal? Robust, dark faces
  such as Dolly, Quadraat, Bembo Book, Absara. Dark, meaty faces all. \r\n\r\nSo what
  are your favourites for text? What of all these light, anemic faces that litter
  the typescape? Opinions? Comments? "

  body: "The problem isn't new, but a condition of hi-res, digital typography, which
    uses single master fonts optimized for mid-size text (hence weak for smaller text),
    and production processes that have little or no \"gain\".\r\nSome of the first
    faces to address it were Adobe Garamond, Charter, Scala, and yes, Quadraat.\r\nI
    think you will find that's it's an issue addressed by a large percentage of digital
    text face designs, it's certainly something I consider for all my serifed designs.\r\n\r\nOne
    solution is to provide different \"weights\" for different circumstances, variables
    such as size, stock, printing technique, etc.\r\nThe most sophisticated has been
    developed by Tobias Frere-Jones. Originally named \"tuning\", now it's <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/mercurytext/grades_duplexing.html\">\"Grades\".</a>

  body: I made a similar thing with Delicato. Regular, Medium and Bold are using almost
    the same width and amount of space and can be chosen for desired "thickness" in
    print without any changes in the text flow. This feature will probably (hopefully)
    be more common for text faces in the future?!

    Maple Medium is proving to be sufficiently \"grunty\", thank you very much! \r\n\r\nWe

  body: "Darkness rules.\r\nAnd although it's true that the anemia of the 70s has
    now been overcome, to me we still have a way to go. Smeijers has probably been
    the most explicit and persistent advocate of darkishness.\r\n\r\n> The most sophisticated
    has been developed by Tobias Frere-Jones.\r\n\r\nFontBureau, and probably specifically
    David Berlow, deserve that credit. On the other hand they in turn publicly credit
    the old Linotype news faces, some of which were in fact repeatedly re-made for
    slightly different gain amounts (as well as widths) but to me not in a sufficiently
    unified way to deny FB due credit.\r\n\r\nSee also this:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/15204\r\n\r\nBut
    it needs to be pointed out here that grades are not intended to make text appear
    darker of its own - more like just compensate for technical issues, in fact to
    <cite>maintain</cite> the weight, and generally the conventional/mainstream weight.\r\n\r\nStefan,
    I love uniwidth fonts (one of the appeals of Compatil to me) but beyond a certain
    weight (including the bold) it causes the black forms to become uncharacteristically
    narrow in order to maintain uniwidth (and in the light end uncharacteristically
    wide).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
