body: Has anyone seen any nice layout for typesetting long lists...I am working on
  a book that has a &#34;101 ways to&#34; section and it just lists and lists and
  lists &#40;101 times&#41;. The lines are fairly short, though a few of them straddle
  two lines. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for some inspiration...Has anyone seen anything
  nice out there? <BR> <BR>My measure is about 24 picas.
