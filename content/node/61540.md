body: "This is a card design in progress for a photographer friend of mine, he's a
  wedding photographer with a bit of an edge whose style is a rather outside the traditional
  wedding box.\r\n\r\nWe decided to use his somewhat offbeat personality to really
  brand him as part of his business, the mark was developed a while back and we printed
  a simple two-sided card. He's now moving into a higher end market segment and wants
  to do a richer looking letterpress card along with some other collateral.\r\n\r\nThis
  is my first shot at the business card, the typeface in the mark and for his name
  is Gotham, the info is set in Eplica. I'm thinking we'd print this with a silver
  metallic and a gold on dark gray stock. I like the way the mark and his name feel
  but I think they could be set a bit higher, I don't know if I like how the contact
  info falls at this point.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clint_lpcard01_5769.jpg]"

    point thing in a thinner line and a teeny bit further from the letters just to
    see what it looks like, but i think this is great.\r\n\r\nif this were mine (which
    it is not), i might also play more with the typography of the info below.  to
    me, it seems a little out-of-place.  maybe a more modern sans serif or serif in
    all caps or all lower caps.  (i know you are probably trying to avoid that b/c
    his URL is clinttakesphotos.)  perhaps you can differentiate between those words
    by reviving the yellow and making 'clint' and 'photos' yellow, but 'takes' in
    white."

    the way \"photgrapher\" plays off the solidness of the name, and I think it worked
    well on the original card which actually did use small caps for the info (below).
    Some good ideas on how to break that up though, let me do some more playing with
    it. Appreciate the input.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clint_card_3958.jpg]"

    would make their vertical \"bends\" a little longer, closer to what you might
    see in the camera frame???  just a suggestion.  also, i have a bad reaction to
    small caps...i like your other use of capitals better ClintTakesPhotos as opposed
    to small caps shown in your update.\r\n\r\njust suggestions!!!"

    card (though I do like the idea) as we're going to a one-sided format and I'm
    not sure there's really enough room for it. I wouldn't be opposed to integrating
    into the one-sided version if I can figure out a solution, however.\r\n\r\nOne
    other person has mentioned the National Geographic thing :) I'm not too worried
    about it as it's more a loose association than anything else, he's also been using
    the yellow as a brand color for a while now so it's a bit late to change it."

    on the L and R rather than top and bottom. the frame mark became kind of a decorative
    element on the piece as well.\r\n\r\nhard to explain! i'm just saying very similar.
    but i'm sure there's no copyright on using FRAMES for PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nif you
    use that first picture, move up the bottom lines of copy away from the edge. i
    also wouldn't mind the CLINT part moved up a bit to look like it fits within a
    true square"

    did a lot of research before doing the mark and didn't run across any photographer
    using the viewfinder idea like we've attempted to. Most wedding photographers
    actually have terrible identities as I've learned, and they seem to like scripty
    type :)\r\n\r\nevanbrog, good ideas, thanks. we had actually talked about doing

  body: "I'm assuming the card is standard size 12P x 21P. I suggest moving all the
    text up 20pt then. This is approximately the average between the distance from
    the left edge of the card to the yellow box/distance from the left edge to \"C\"
    in Clint. Hard to measure it accurately on a jpg, but that should be close. The
    visual focus stays on the mark and pulls all the text into a single unified form.
    This puts it below the vertical center, but the smaller space at the bottom works
    with the lighter type and brings your eye back to the mark. I think centering
    it vertically would give you an odd looking space at the top and it won't relate
    as well to the side spaces.\r\n\r\nIf you want a two-sided card I suggest just
    putting the mark alone, same placement as the reverse and switch the color scheme
    like you did in the second example: Yellow background, box in white, Clint in
    grey.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't do anything else. You could work with the line spacing
    between the type blocks, but it will work fine without having to do that and I
    think that length of time vs. diminishing returns makes it kind of nitpicky. \r\n\r\nIn
    my opinion.\r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a

    I think one-sided may be the way to go, I like the sound of your alignment ideas
    so I'll try them and see how it works. Any thought on the information typeface
    itself?

    information. As I said, I wouldn't change anything beyond placement. The card
    works well, and no it doesn't look like the \"c-word,\" The spaces within the
    mark are pretty consistent so there's no confusion.\r\n\r\nYou could fiddle with
    different faces for the text, but the way it is now there is a four step hierarchy
    and that's not going to get a lot better with different typefaces. Of course it's
    hard to tell from the jpg.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're going letterpress, price out a
    blind emboss for the mark which would make it even more striking. Just a thought.\r\n\r\nGeorge
