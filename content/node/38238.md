  Fontlab Fast'/the MSN page on how to export illus. into Fontlab. But, I can't believe
  it's impossible to export illus. into Fontlab without changing the shapes of the
  characters drawn in illus?\r\nIt snaps to point, which is very annoying. Can anybody
  please ease my pain? Yes, it's boring one."

    work-around may be to use a higher UPM value in FontLab. You are not limited to

    even when drawing characters straight into Fontlab you have to draw strokes which
    meet the integers?"
