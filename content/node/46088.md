  Peak is out.</a> It only costs $30 for a premium decorative display font loaded
  with OpenType features and a supporting cast of 590 extras. Or you can have the
  \"cut-down\" version&#8212;Pyke's Peak Zero&#8212;for zero cash outlay. On the Myfonts
  font family page, click on \"purchase options\", then download Pyke's Peak Zero
  for $0.\r\n\r\nFor an idea of what full kit and kanoodle can do, grab all the <a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/pykes-peak/gallery.html\" target=\"_new\">samples
  of old Pykie</a> and salivate at the extras sheet.\r\n\r\n<strong>Q.</strong> What's
  the deal with \"zero cost\"? \r\n<strong>A.</strong> With the recent controversy
  over web font embedding using the CSS @font-face property, the associated problem
  of unauthorized distribution of fonts only licensed for private use, and the \"looming
  spectre\" of the great web \"fugly\", I decided to do as much as I could to help
  the situation with a single font release. \r\n\r\nPP Zero is licensed for:\r\n*
  personal (non-profit) <em>and</em> commercial use\r\n* yes you read that right\r\n*
  unlimited copying & distribution on font archive sites\r\n* \"embedding\" on webpages
  using CSS @font-face property\r\n* unlimited distribution on web servers\r\n* no
  logo fee\r\n\r\nPP Zero plays with a full deck. \r\n* ultra-complete Latin 1 & Latin
  2 character set\r\n* full outline quality of PP regular (outlines are not degraded
  in any way)\r\n* OpenType with standard ligatures (LIGA) and fractions (FRAC)\r\n\r\nWhat
  you don't get with PP Zero<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/arboghast/2511483112/in/set-72157605345678800/\"
  target=\"_new>>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;the extra 590 ligatures (DLIG), contextual alternates
  (CALT), lining numerals (LNUM) and stylistic alternate (SALT) bells and whistles
  of PP Regular&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</a>\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    had 3 heads too.\r\n\r\nYou've got some choices going there Chris, which I would
    have qualms about using. The EL - ED combination in TRAVELLED could have had more
    grace, and the opposing F's in DIFFERENCE redefine \"awkward\". That's typical,
    I give you the keys to a Pyke's Peak racer with a 1000 Horsepower motor in it
    and you go tearing up the mountain and leave behind a big mess (;^) There's an
    art to driving this machine, and a zen to it as well.\r\n\r\nThanks Linda and
    Russell and Ray for beta testing old Pykie. Its \"casual wierdness\" works in
    a good way for <em>How to Make a Peacock Fly</em> &#8211; a strange kind of erm,
    object in a box!. There are two kinds of comments I would dearly appreciate hearing
    about:\r\n\r\n1) How useful is the zero cost license, does that and the PP Zero
    font help address the looming spectre of web fugly?\r\n\r\n2) What would you use
    Pyke's Peak for (both the full retail version and PP Zero)?\r\n\r\nAnd the third
    thing*, how many web designers are you going to pass a copy of PP Zero on to?
    I will send a prize, a pair of uber-cool mirror aviator sunglasses like the unit
    being modeled here by Plush Jimi, to the person who gets PP Zero into the hands
    of three big-time kick-arse web designers.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plushjimi_6208.jpg]\r\n\r\n*

  body: "James has done something special here with this type design. Instead of filling
    a well-known and well populated type market sector with yet another version of
    a known quantity, he has opened a road to a place yet reached. That is why I chose
    Frost's verse as a sample to show his work. Someone has to take those first bold
    steps into the unknown and mark a path yet traveled. Here is a place where it
    can be celebrated to be dyslexic, not as a handicap but as a venue to read again
    in a new way. James has married the softness and warmth of   written hand with
    \ crisp, defined anatomy of constructed type and in a playful way. Users can be
    children at heart with a naive smile and a tickle from a feather. It is fun again
    to put away the seriousness we all deal with daily and have a good therapeutic
    play session! \r\nI am not saying Pyke's Peak is a finishing stroke and a completed
    journey. It is one small step taken in a new direction without fear and without
    a guided tour. Thanks, James! for giving us a peek at your yet to be defined path!\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Cheers Eben. Cheers Chris, you have a succinct way of describing these things.
    Turning a negative into a positive is very much part of what I set out to do with
    Pyke's Peak.\r\n\r\n@Chris: <em>No, figuratively, as in turning a handicap into
    an advantage, celebrating what appears to be a negative by making it into a positive.</em>\r\n\r\n\"Figurative\"
    is the key word. Type is sculpture. It's all about carving up whitespace with
    figures and the task of on-going <em>figuration</em>. \"It helps that\" turning
    some letters around permits combinations heretofor-inconcievable.\r\n\r\nThe mirror
    ligs concept is a <em>trouble maker</em>&#8212;a device that multiplies possibilities.
    A backwards R is still an R and still functions as an R, with new semantic range.
