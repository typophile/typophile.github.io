  body: "Part of sharing some obvious similarities with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/|Univers]]
    (mainly because of /G, /R and /S are totally off), I guess a fair answer would
    probably be to consider it as a proprietary/custom font by HARA (a closer look
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/97462/|here]]).\r\nSome very loosely
    similars: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/etica/|Etica]], [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100009|Verlag]],
