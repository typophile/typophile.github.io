  body: 'This should be in the ''critique'' section. I like the modulation of the
    strokes; it has a welcoming look. There are problems with getting the weights
    of the strokes of different characters to harmonize. The e stands out as too heavy.
    I think if you get this into FontLab, you will find it easier to harmonize and
    develop it.  '

    like what you have drawn, and think it is promising. But I think there is a lot
    of work on such matters to make it look polished and balanced. It will be worth
    the effort. Compare with such very polished stuff such as Frutiger, Scala, Syntax,
    Thesis and Fedra for ideas--also Franklin, as you have a touch of it in your c
    etc. [adding again]--also Optima. "

  body: "Tina,\r\nThe \"e\" problem mentioned by William may be a \"total width\"
    problem as opposed to a stroke weight problem.  Without measuring, widen the e,
    keeping the stroke weight the same, until it feels equal to the o.  You will probably
    have to test text sizes to really know if it works.  Letters with several strokes
    can start to feel heavy--the 2 story g is typical but even e and a have need for
    optical correction. The diagonal crossbar on your e causes dark spots at joins
    but that doesn't mean don't do it, it just means you have to find other ways to
    counter the effect. You will probably learn more about designing glyphs as a set
    by doing it your way than doing it an easier way so keep it up!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I think this has a lovely 'classic' feel to it. I agree with Hrant that it's
    worth while finishing it. \r\nPersonally I kinda like the 'e'. OK, it will give
    you problems solving the graytone in your font, but if I see how you've managed
    your first curves, I'm fairly confident you'll do just fine.\r\nGet it into FontLab
    and you can more easily work on the harmony of the font. \r\n\r\nSome little things
    you might wanna look for:\r\n- Maybe give the foot of the 'y' a bit more weight.
    It ends a bit to thin, if you ask me. \r\n- The spine of the 'S' is to heavy.
    And it seems to be hanging backwords just a bit. You might wanna rotate a degree
    clockwise. \r\n- The 'M' could be more heavy overall.\r\n- Perhaps you should
    modify the bowl of the 'p'. It's to much an 'o' with a stem stuck to it. Technically
    you did it right, but optically something bothers me about the bowl/stem configuration
    (look at the word 'Up'). The 'q' seems fine to me.\r\n\r\nI love:\r\n- Your big
    'O'\r\n- Your numerals look very promissing. I want to see more, please. I think
    they'd be very lovely as OSF (Old Style Figures).\r\n- Your sharp curves, they
    have a freshness to it.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work and give us an update when
    you've put it into FontLab. I'd like to see some text set in this font. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n\r\n***

  body: "This seems like a typeface that Doyald Young would love, largely because
    it feels like it descends from an inscriptional model (i.e. the caps feel a lot
    like Optima to me). It's very clear and fresh feeling, although there's a tiny
    whiff of late-70s high-class apartment lobby to it (don't ask me where I come
    up with these associations, I just do).\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the bar on the
    R feels weak, I like the X although I fear it's a little out of character for
    the rest of the font, and the slanted bar in the e is cute, although it inevitably
    calls Kabel to mind. I want to see b, d, p and q larger, because right now I'm
    not sure I'm that enthusiastic about the d and the p's counters."

  body: "Tina,\r\n\r\nWhat you have taken on is quite difficult for a first font.
    It looks great, so keep going! There are several influences that might be hard
    to reconcile: The 2 looks like a good old grotesque, the e says \"70's\" to me,
    and the vertical stroke axis is reminding me faintly of Peignot. Otherwise it
    looks like a very strong, classic humanist sans with a little geometric stiffness
    thrown in. Nice!\r\n\r\nI hope you have been looking at other modulated sans designs
    all the while. Though the style is very different (and should stay that way),
    look at Legacy Sans for ideas about distributing weight and how far to go with
    modulation. Stellar is another design you could study; it's quite subtle and interesting
    (metal versions preferably). Also Charlotte Sans, which is subtly modulated if
    a bit stiff. \r\n\r\nI'm intrigued you are exploring this area; If we are going
    to have another century of Sans Serif type, it ought to evolve, and modulating
    the stem weights opens a lot of possibilities for typefaces which have been seen
    as limited in usefulness. "

    in developing this font you have the challenge of creating self-made 'rules' consistently
    carried out (such as problem of the light weight of the bottom of the R bowl),
    but without making it staid or stale--you don't want that 'tiny wiff' to become
    more than that. \r\nBalanced and consistent, but still fresh--not easy to pull

  body: "Tina,\r\n\r\nI don't have much to add to what's already been said. There
    are definite problem areas which have mostly been mentioned, like the too-thin
    part of the R. \r\n\r\nIt does appear that you have a good grasp of the basic
    tricks of construction (e.g., correcting for optical effects, visual vs. geometric
    center, etc.). \r\n\r\nI would agree with Carl about the numbers. They are very
    nice, but don't seem to fit the rest of the design. \r\n\r\nI think I would rather
    see a horizontal bar on the e. The Jenson e does not really seem to fit this design.
    If want to keep it, you could try to work more angular stress into the overall
    design. Then it might work better.\r\n\r\nI would be tempted to put a crossbar
    on the G. In a face like Optima, you can get away with that form because all the
    other curved forms are very open. Here, your curved forms are more closed, so
    it leave a sort of trapped empty space in the G. A crossbar might mitigate this.
    It's worth a try, anyway."

    arm of K, upper join of R's bowl to the stem, as are the points (both) where the

    wide, and the terminal needs help, but the original idea is great. However, the
    character seems out of place in the greater context of the font. You need to either
    add some of that extreme contrast somewhere else, or take it out of the R. Don't
    take it out, though. It's the best idea in the font so far.
