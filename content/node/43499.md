  body: "Hi Arlo! Looking at it, looks very good, sort of gothic tinted with some
    serifs. I guess it will make a good text face.\r\nI would say that the \"N\" needs
    the diagonal a little bit thinner. The \"W\" also needs thinner inner diagonals.
    I would enlarge the bowl of the \"b\" to the south a bit, and the \"q\" a bit
    to the north more or less the same fashion you would do for the \"b\".\r\n\r\nCool!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: It's been a while since posting the first rendition. Here's what I've been
    up to since. I've modified the bowls of the p,q,b,d, and alt a,g to match more
    harmoniously. I've also added a set of numbers, both lining and old style. Any
    more comments would be wonderful.

  body: It's nice. The 'o' looks a little strange next to the 'd' (like in 'stood').

  body: I like the changes. Now, italic. Hopefully more people will comment, or see
    stuff I can't see. Good job.
