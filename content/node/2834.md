body: This is a little something I have been working on, my first serif type. It is
  related to Kilbirnie Sans. The &#39;p&#39; is off, can&#39;t quite get it right
  at this stage. I intend for this to be a fairly serious type. Comments are more
  than welcome.  <BR> <BR>Thanks, kris. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24833.jpg"

  body: The disconnect on the b is interesting, but isn&#39;t duplicated in any other
    characters.  You&#39;re a lot better at getting your binocular g right than I
    am, but it does seem to lean forward a little bit.  Your f has a non-standard
    lower serif; is this intentional?  Also, the f doesn&#39;t thin like others through
    the top curve.  The taper at the top of the t seems odd, but maybe I&#39;m feeling
    the effects of the hour. <BR> <BR>Given a more perfected form, I&#39;d use this
    for published materials.
