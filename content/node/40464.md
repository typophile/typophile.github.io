  solution for all typographic problems, from legibility to space saving efficiency.
  It will come in two styles, serifed (with those little feet thingies on the bottoms
  and tops of some strokes) and sans serif (without those little feet thingies) (Serif
  is Latin or something for little feet things.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-\r\n\r\n"
