  body: That's just a crappy grunged version of Helvetica Bold. I've seen it once
    before, and I think it's downloadable from Dafont. It would look much better if
    you did it yourself.

    and why not post this on the 'Type ID' board?\r\n\r\nFrode is right... it's an
    awful freebie on dafont. Look under 'Fancy-Distorted'. It's not really difficult
    to find."
