  re-branding process to mark our anniversary.\r\n\r\nWe have had a logo designed
  and the font in it is Geosans. As part of the work we do, we produce a lot of written
  reports along with quotations and letters.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions
  on fonts that will go well with Geosans?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nJess\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: "Traditionally Bodoni was considered a good partner.\r\n\r\nThe slab serif
    look of Beton (a sort of \"Futura Slab Serif\") is contemporary.\r\nMemphis, for
    a larger x-height.\r\nCandida, for more contrast, and a more traditional look
    suitable for extended text.\r\n\r\nThese are all vintage faces, like Futura, from
    the early/mid 20th century.\r\n\r\n"

    Futura and Bodoni looked good together?

  body: "It's a bit of a strange relationship, because the letter shapes are so different
    (e.g. Futura's splayed \"M\"), but Agha recognized the geometric qualities of
    Bodoni, e.g. the idea that its serifs could be considered as slab serifs. Bodoni
    is also quite reductive, in that it appears to have two stem widths, and no transition
    between them. Again, this was a fresh interpretation of the face, because Giambattista's
    fonts were far more nuanced than that, as can be seen in Postmodern revivals such
    as ITC Bodoni and Filosofia. And in comparison to the style of didone that had
    predominated throughout the 19th and early 20th century\u2014the Scotch Modern,
    with its huge serifs (many hooked), ball terminals and furled forms\u2014Bodoni
    is a very understated design. "
