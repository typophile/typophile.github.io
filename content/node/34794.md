body: "There are several arrow-looking glyphs in Minion Pro that have the same glyph
  number (2192). They have different GID numbers (i.e., 1364 and 1376). Is there a
  way to find/change using a GID number in the change field? How do you format it?
  (I know you put a unicode in angle-brackets, but in this case, when I enter the
  common unicode number, I get the arrow-looking glyph that I DON'T want [GID 1376]
  instead of the one I want [1364].)\r\n\r\nCan anyone help? thanks!"

    I don't know if that can help.\r\n\r\n[added]\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/minionpro/README\">README</a>
    file of the <a href=\"http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=minionpro\">MinionPro
    package for LaTeX</a>, there are three versions of MinionPro: version 001.000
    coming with 'Adobe Type Classics for Learning', version 001.001 included in the
    'Adobe Font Folio Opentype Edition CD' and version 002.000 included in Acrobat
    Reader installations and currently for sale. Those versions are different enough
    to require three different encoding files for the LaTeX installation. The version
    I looked at is 002.000."
