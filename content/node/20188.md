body: Hi, this is my this is my third posting in this site. What do you thing about
  type designed for moving images? Are there any "rules" I should be aware of? I am
  thinking that fields separation would be an issue cause it would distort type in
  mothion since one would never see on any actual frame the crisp bezier form that
  the designer struggled to get right... any sites I should be looking at?
