  how you manage your lowercase glyphs in this situations. I want the same for \"A\"
  and \"a\", so how do you do this? Copy-paste? What about kerning? Is there any way
  to \"delete\" those glyphs? but I need that even the user type A or a the same letter
  came up.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nMike"

    So I want to make a kerning class for each UPPERCASE containing the equal lowercase
    so lowercases can work with the uppercase kerning. Am I right?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
