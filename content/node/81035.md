  that looks very similar). The project relates to jazz music of the era so any retro
  and/or jazzy typeface recommendations are welcome.\r\n\r\nI have this image with
  some type I'd like to imitate. Especially the \"Sound Magic\" in the third row.
  Can anyone id any of these faces?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jazzlofttapeboxesfull_3415.jpg]"
