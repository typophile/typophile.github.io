  Typeface"> <BR> <BR>This is a typeface that I have developed as a basis for a random
  process of events to be applied towards. The original basis for the typeface was
  to create something that had both stamina to withstand the process as well as refined
  details that would be eliminated by the process. I wanted to create a very straight
  lined classical font to apply a very conceptual idea towards. '
