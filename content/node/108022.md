    name Prussian Academy of Sciences Preu\xDFische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Royal
    Prussian Academy of Sciences) dates from 1918 and I suspect the inscription is
    from that era.\r\nIt was then the usual practice of major architects to develop
    their own lettering styles. Here we have a revised and condensed version of the
    Trajan column lettering, designed to be effective as a monumental incised design.
    Note the flavor of Louis Perrin's Lyons capitals, known in Europe as Elzevir/Romana
    and in the US & UK as De Vinne. Distinctive features include the W which has a
    very low vertex of W.\r\nNo fonts are a perfect match, but a few are similar in
    various respects.\r\nGrand Central, by Tobias Frere-Jones based on the 1920s capitals
