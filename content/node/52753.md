body: "Hello :)  I'm a bit new to the web development world, but I had two questions
  regarding Web Fonts that I ask with the desire to follow the rules...in general,
  if I want to use a unique font on my website, does your average font license allow
  me to install it on my web server if:\r\n\r\na) I'm the only one that is making
  dynamic design changes (like I'm adding new forum topics and I want those forum
  names to be displayed in the special font for my site visitors), or\r\n\r\nb) Users
  can make their own personal pages on my site, and the names of their usernames are
  displayed in the special font (so in this case another person is playing a role
  in the customization of my website but they can't choose the font, only the text
  itself of their username).\r\n\r\nPlease share your wisdom...thanks so much!!! PS
  -- I realize that certain fonts have different licenses, just trying to understand
  in general...thanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm assuming that you're not talking about the new @font-face command, since
    that's not supported but by like 2 browsers. That being the case, you're probably
    using something like [[http://jquery.thewikies.com/sifr/|]]sIFR? (My link goes
    to jQuery sIFR, much better than the original...) If that's the case, then you
    are technically embedding the typeface into the flash file. Many licenses allow
    for that, but not all.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you are using something like [[http://facelift.mawhorter.net/|Facelift]],
    then the rules are different. You are not embedding or distributing a typeface,
    so you can use almost any font you want. (That being said, make sure the permissions
    on the font folder are correct to prevent unauthorized access) What this does
    is use PHP to dynamically replace your text with a PNG image, not any different
    at all from using any font on your computer in Photoshop, a practice that is universally
    accepted.\r\n\r\nThat's my two bits at least."

  body: "OK that's definitely helpful, because I know this project will be built in
    PHP.\r\n\r\nSo what your saying is that my developers install the font on our
    web server, make sure the permissions on our web server's font folder are restricted,
    and then use something like Facelift or its PHP equivalent to dynamically create
    PNG files.  This way, the font manifestation is just embedded as an image within
    my site, which is in essence a static publishing of an image and the font is not
    being distributed or available for use by the average web user as an actual stand
    alone font, which is generally accepted.\r\n\r\nIf we apply a gradient layer to
    the text in the original Photoshop design, I wonder if the same PHP process can
    programatically apply this gradient as well to the final PNG file of the resultant
    image....\r\n\r\nThanks again so much!"

  body: Facelift uses PHP and the GD library. Anything you can do with the GD library
    can be done using the Facelift software if your programmers know how to modify
    it properly.

    to check the EULAs. For many foundries any server use at all is prohibited, no
    matter if the output of the rendering are just bitmap images. "

  body: "In my experience most EULAs are silent on server based rendering, and others
    restrict it (in your option b each Web site member would be counted as a \"user\").
    I don\u2019t recall any commercial font EULAs that specifically say it\u2019s
    okay. Having said that server generated bitmapped text is as old as the (graphical)
    Web so the standard advice \u201Cask the vendor\u201D holds true, at least they\u2019ll
    have been asked this question before.\r\n\r\n"
