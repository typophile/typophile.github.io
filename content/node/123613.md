    is only sold as a family (13 fonts) for $150.00. As far as I know, you can\u2019t
    purchase single weights.\r\n\r\nBut, you might want to email the folks at House
    Industries and ask if they would be willing to sell just that weight to you. The
    worst they can do is say no....\r\nwww.houseind.com"
