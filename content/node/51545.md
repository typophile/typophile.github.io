  body: This is probably custom, (I don't know personally) You could easily create
    the Word <em>OGGOI</em> in illustrator or free hand if you wish. Just base it
    on your example above.

  body: "@ robbiefa: it'snt custom for sure... and i know very well how to create
    in illustrator a G starting from the E, or finding one in all graphics from all
    episodes, but... a existing type wil be better, and easier...\r\n\r\n@ Lex Kominek:
