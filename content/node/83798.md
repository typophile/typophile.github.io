  body: The tattoo artist isn't going to stick your arm (or your leg, or your butt)
    in a laser printer. He or she is going to draw the letters by hand, and he or
    she doesn't need to know the name of the font to do that. Just show the tattoo
    artist the same photo you posted here, and say "Make the letters look like this."
