  had a closer technical look at AdobeDevanagari-Regular.otf, version 1.105 (2011),
  and here are my findings:\r\n\r\n1. The Latin diacritics required for transliterating
  Indic (Hindi, Sanskrit, etc.) texts is incomplete. The diacritic for \"sh\" (both
  lowercase and uppercase), very frequently used in Indic words, e.g. in Shiva etc.,
  is missing.\r\n\r\n2. Many frequently used ligatures are missing, even ligatures
  which have a frequency of much more than 0.01 %, e.g. \"ddhv\" (frequency 0.215
  %).\r\n\r\nFor details see http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/adobe-ligatures.pdf\r\n\r\nFor
  comparison see http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf (page 29 seq.)\r\n\r\n3.
  The Adobe Devanagari font does not work with older Windows and older Word.\r\n\r\nFor
  example, Adobe Devanagari does not work with old Microsoft Word, version 10, in
  conjunction with Windows XP.\r\n\r\nFor comparison, Mangal and all the other Devanagari
  Unicode fonts known to me work with older Word and older Windows, provided the Uniscribe
  system library for foreign language support was installed with Windows.\r\n"

  body: "The first thing that should be noted is that Adobe Devanagari was designed
    specifically for modern Hindi use, and not for Sanskrit; it may be of limited
    use even for other modern languages such as Marathi and Nepali. The design brief
    was specifically to target use of Hindi in a modern business environment (the
    font was originally made to bundle with Acrobat), and not scholarly use.\r\n\r\n1.
    That could be an oversight. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.\r\n\r\n2.
    See note above re. target language support. The ligature set was based on a mixed
    approach: referencing the set employed in Linotype Devanagari (on which Fiona
    also worked) and also frequency analysis of modern Hindi text.\r\n\r\n3. Correct.
    The font uses only the newer 'dev2' script tag and layout behaviour, not the older,
    deprecated <deva> shaping. This is what Adobe spec'd. Hence the font will not
    work in pre-Vista versions of Windows or other environments that only support
    'deva'."

    use, and not for Sanskrit</strong>\r\n\r\nThat's okay, but a circumspect designer,
    adding only a few additional ligatures could make the font also suitable for Marathi
    and Sanskrit. For example, for Classical Sanskrit, only 11 additional ligatures
    would be required to make the Adobe Devanagari font suitable for Classical Sanskrit
    (as opposed to Vedic Sanskrit).\r\n\r\nsee file adobe-ligatures.pdf (see the missing
    ligatures marked with \"!!!\")\r\n\r\n<strong>B) > That could be an oversight</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
    oversight was due to the fact that most Indic diacritics are in the Unicode range
    1E0C through 1E96, with the exception of\r\n\r\n015A Sacute\r\n015B sacute\r\n\r\nwhich
    are used in Polish texts, but which happen to be used also as Indic diacritics.\r\n\r\n<strong>C)

    this should be the case, then there must have been made design errors.\r\n\r\n(Cave:
    I am not a Hindi expert, so that a scholar should examine the following)\r\n\r\n(a)
    On the one hand, it seems to me (see cave above) that the Adobe Devanagari font
    INCLUDES ligatures, which are (to my knowledge) NOT used in Hindi (and also NOT
    used in Sanskrit etc.), for example \"kspr\":\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/kspr-kspl.jpg\r\n\r\nDid
    the Adobe designers invent the ligature \"kspr\" just for fun?\r\n\r\n(b) On the
    other hand, it seems to me (see cave above) that the Adobe Devanagari font LACKS
    ligatures, which are (to my knowledge) USED in Hindi, for example \"dg\" in the
    Hindi word \"khadga\" (= \"sword\" in English):\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/khadga.jpg\r\n\r\nIn
    the Oxford Hindi-English dictionary by McGregor published in 1993, the word \"khadga\"
    was typeset with virama, i.e. without ligature, due to the fact that professional
    Devanagari fonts, such as Siddhanta.ttf and Sanskrit2003.ttf, were not available
    at that time. But today in the Unicode era, it is possible to design professional
    Devanagari fonts suited for Hindi.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether a Hindi scholar ever
    checked the Adobe Devanagari font for ligatures\r\n(a) required for Hindi and\r\n(b)
    not used in Hindi\r\n\r\nInstead of including ligatures required for Hindi, the
    Adobe Devanagari fonts includes a plethora of fancy ikara variants which would
    only make sense in a font containing the required ligatures.\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/ikara.jpg"

    Linotype Devanagari font, which was used a lot in newspapers and whose glyph set
    was in part developed in response to requests from newspaper editors in India.
    It is entirely possible that some conjuncts were intended for commonly transliterated
    words from other languages.\r\n\r\nI do think a more systematic, analytical approach
    should be taken to defining the conjunct set for Hindi fonts, as Uli has done
    for Sanskrit. In the case of the Adobe Devanagari, we compiled a set from a variety
    of sources. We had intended to cover Marathi too, but the development schedule
    wasn't very long because it needed to be bundled with Acrobat, so we had to prioritise
    for Adobe's principal targets. We did do testing of extended Hindi texts -- including
    an entire novel -- and found the font to perform well.\r\n\r\nUli, it is worth
    bearing in mind that modern Hindi typography has broken quite significantly with
    the Sanskrit tradition. I understand your comment re. fonts that support only
    the more common conjunct ligatures, but that seems to me very much the perspective
    of a Sanskritist: Hindi readers have been used to extensive use of half forms
    and, for some letters, even explicit halants ever since the hot metal typesetting
    days. Indeed, when Fiona first reintroduced some of the conjunct ligature forms
    in the digital LT Devanagari (for the Linotron 202) there was resistance from
    some Indian customers to what were perceived as 'Sanskrit' forms. A lot of the
    custom encoding solutions for Hindi fonts, e.g. the Modular Infotech system, remain
    based around extensive half form use. None of this is to say that we couldn't,
    with more time and research, have come up with a better Hindi conjunct set for
    Adobe Devanagari, but that the expectation that any given conjunct, however rare,
    should be presented in its ligature form is not one that Hindi readers share with
    you.\r\n\r\nThank you, by the way, for the very helpful review documents, which
    I'll certainly examine carefully and I hope will help us to do better in future."

    Grammar\r\n\r\nsee http://archive.org/details/hindigrammar00greauoft\r\n\r\nthe
    ligature \"dg\" is reckoned as a \"principal compound\".\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/dga.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
    book by Greaves has also an interesting introduction describing \"High Hindi\"
    as a language \"for those who delight to cram their pages with high-sounding Sanskrit
    words\" (see page 4 of the scanned book). But this was 90 years ago.\r\n\r\n2)
    Mr. Hudson:\r\n\r\nI did not say that I have \"the expectation that any given
    conjunct, however rare, should be presented in its ligature form\".  On the contrary,
    I said that \"only 11 additional ligatures would be required to make the Adobe
    Devanagari font suitable for Classical Sanskrit\".\r\n\r\nWhat I criticize is
    that the Adobe Devanagari font contains many extremely infrequent and perhaps
    entirely unattestable ligatures, whereas this font lacks very frequent ligatures,
    at least as far as Sanskrit is concerned.\r\n\r\n3) Mr. Boyer and Mr. Hudson:\r\n\r\nI
    made a <strong>complete</strong> compound analysis of the Adobe Devanagari font,
    which will be of interest to Mr. Boyer and to Mr. Hudson:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/adobe-ligatures-analysis.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
    frequency counts are based on Sanskrit texts developed for Sanskrit fonts, but
    these statistics may be also of help for Hindi-only fonts.\r\n\r\nThe most infrequent
    or rarest, though attestable, Sanskrit compounds have a frequency of 0.001 %.
    \ This means that in 100000 (one hundred thousand) lines of Sanskrit texts, this
    compound occurs only ONCE on an average.\r\n\r\nNow, if Mr. Boyer applies his
    Gnu Hindi dictionary word count utility to the compounds listed on pages 27 through
    37 of the above file (adobe-ligatures-analysis.pdf) containing the rarest or most
    infrequent Sanskrit ligatures (0.001%), I predict that Mr. Boyer is sure to discover
    that innumerable ligatures (compounds), which are indeed contained in the Adobe
    Devanagari font cannot be attested (i.e. located or found) in his Hindi dictionary.
    If this be true (let's see), this would mean that the Adobe Devanagari font contains
    innumerable unattested compounds (ligatures) with a frequency of 0.000 % (nil,
    nothing)."

    font. It is entirely possible that Adobe will want to extend its glyph set coverage
    for other languages, but I suspect that modern languages such as Marathi, Konkani
    and Nepali would be their priorities. I'm a little surprised that you reckon only
    eleven more conjunct ligatures would be needed for classical Sanskrit; I would
    think more.\r\n\r\nFiona confirms that some of the conjuncts inherited from the
    Linotype set were for transliteration of foreign words; we included them in Adobe
    Devanagari because the Linotype fonts are a recognised standard among some Indian
    customers, and to deviate from the set would be to invite criticism and require
    explanation. Instead, we get criticism from a German Sanskritist and have to explain
    to him. :)\r\n\r\nThe core sets on which the Adobe Devanagari set are based were
    the Linotype Devanagari (for compatibility with a perceived 'standard') and that
    provided by <a href=\"http://hindiurduflagship.org/\">Rupert Snell</a> in his
    Hindi grammar, which is the most up-to-date source for the modern language. Recently,
    we had occasion to add some extra variants for one of Adobe's customers who wanted
    different forms for certain conjuncts.\r\n\r\nGreaves' comment about 'High Hindi'
    is worth bearing in mind. You cite \u0916\u0921\u094D\u0917 as an example of the
    'dg' conjunct in Hindi, but the common modern Hindi word for sword is \u0924\u0932\u0935\u093E\u0930.\r\n\r\nClearly
    Michel is not going to find 'innumerable' conjuncts in Adobe Devanagari that do
    not occur in Hindi words: he is going to find a precise number, and these will
    all be conjuncts that also appeared in the Linotype set. Far from being 'invented
    just for fun', they were included in a set whose size was limited by technical
    restraints at the request of Linotype's Indian customers, in order to cleanly
    (without explicit halant) render transliterations of common foreign words in Hindi
    newspapers. In the context of those newspapers, it is entirely likely that some
    foreign words would be more common than those Hindi words that contain low frequency
    conjuncts. [Transliteration of foreign words, especially proper names, was a major
    factor for newspaper typesetting in the Subcontinent. Full-word ligatures needed
    to be added to Urdu fonts whenever the Soviet Union had a change of leaders.]"

    of view, I agree, but these conjunct ligatures were made at the request of <em>newspaper
    publishers,</em> who are perennially concerned with column width and word length,
    and for whom being able to reduce the width of commonly occurring words through
    ligation was a practical benefit (especially if you bear in mind that newsprint
    was rationed in India for long periods of the 20th Century). Linotype were not
    'cashing in on selling unique ligatures': you are entirely misunderstanding the
    nature of the commercial relationship between newspapers and typesetting machine
    manufacturers at that time. Newspapers invested in <em>machines,</em> and the
    makers of those machines provided fonts according to the specifications of the
    newspaper publishers. It is not as if Linotype invented these conjunct ligatures
    and offered them for sale to the newspapers; rather, the newspaper publishers
    and editors who had purchased the Linotype typesetting machinery requested the
    addition of these ligatures to their fonts.\r\n\r\nI think we're at a point in
    the development of Indic fonts now where we should reasonably consider whether
    these legacy transliteration ligatures, which were developed at a particular point
    in time for a particular technology and particular customer base, should be ignored.
    As I reported earlier, we included them in Adobe Devanagari because of concerns
    that users in India familiar with the Linotype sets might consider the Adobe set
    deficient if it did not include them. This sort of thing happens in situations
    in which the only reference that many people have for judging the quality of a
    new font is comparison with previous fonts. We encounter this regularly. I think,
    Uli, that you and Michel are on entirely the right track with frequency analysis:
    this is a much better basis on which to plan glyph sets, and in line with what
    we're doing these days (bear in mind that although Adobe Devanagari was only recently

    using real-world marketing considerations as a guide to the design of its fonts.\r\n\r\nThis
    is not to say, however, that it would not also be nice, if by the addition of
    a limited number of additional glyphs, the font could be made usable for other
    languages using the Devanagari script besides Hindi, to add those glyphs. After
    all, as things stand now, it should really be called a Hindi font and not a Devanagari
    font - just as a font not including the characters for typesetting, say, Serbian
    ought to be called a Russian font and not a Cyrillic font.\r\n\r\nThus, to be
    able to set Sanskrit after a fashion, and Hindi well - by including ligatures
    for foreign words commonly transliterated in Hindi - would be good. And the other
    point raised, that a limited number of glyphs are missing that are at least shown
    by dictionaries as used by Hindi - <em>if</em>, indeed, the number is limited,
    then perhaps they should be added as well. This, though, is less important - as
    here we are talking about ligatures, to which virama is always an alternative.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the example above, yes, dga is different from nga, since the former doesn't
    have a dot - but since omitting a dot is much easier than drawing a new character
    from scratch, if nga is included, then since dga comes cheaply from a design point
    of view, unless the size of the font comes at a premium, dga <em>ought</em> to
    be included if the language could call for it.\r\n\r\nSo I think that while the
    criticism of Adobe adding useless ligatures just for fun can be thrown out, some
    of the other objections seem to have enough merit that, if, on examination, they
    really do call for nothing more than the addition of a very limited number of
    glyphs, they could  be highly constructive."

    analysis of the Hunspel and Aspell dictionaries, and am now in the process of
    correlating to your Sanskrit ligature list and Ernst Tremel's Hindi list. The
    number of ligature un-attested in these sources is gradually being whittled down,
    and most that remain are either what I classify as systematic inclusions -- i.e.
    representative of core aspects of the writing systems qua system such as merged
    -R forms of each letter -- or are fairly obvious transliteration sequences.\r\n\r\nWith
    regard to the latter, I've come to the conclusion that their inclusion needs to
    be a matter of individual font and its intended purpose. Coincidentally, Fiona
    just communicated to me a request from a major Bengali language newspaper publisher
    to include an SPL conjunct ligature for the transliteration of the English loan
    word 'splinter', which apparently occurs often enough in the context of politics
    to be afforded such treatment. Recently, we worked on user interface fonts for
    Hindi, and analysed the localised strings for the operating system and other software,
    finding such unexpected transliterated conjuncts as TZV (barmitzva). Not all of
    these end up with ligature solutions -- if I can get the half form shaping for
    rare sequences to look good, that's what I'll use --, but they illustrate the
    reality of transliterated loan words in modern Hindi.\r\n\r\nAt present, I am
    working on a font specifically for pre-modern Hindi texts, so being able to identify
    the source and attestation for different groups of conjunct ligatures is very

    Devanagari glyph set spreadsheet with the data Michel derived from the Hunspell
    and Aspell dictionaries and with Ernst Tremel's list of Hindi conjunct ligatures.\r\n\r\nI
    am suspicious of both the Hunspell and Aspell dictionaries as attestation sources
    for many Hindi conjuncts, simply because they seem to include high numbers of
    transliterated or transcribed foreign loan words. Tremel's list makes more sense
    to me, based on his sources, although this too contains some loan words and, importantly
    in terms of glyph set design, includes large numbers of conjuncts that almost
    all Hindi writers would instead write with anusvara, e.g. \u0938\u0902\u0916\u094D\u092F\u093E
    instead of \u0938\u0919\u094D\u0916\u094D\u092F\u093E. Also, Tremel's list does
    not include frequency data.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the Adobe Devanagari set, there
    are about 100 conjunct ligatures that are not attested in any of the lists, of
    which a significant number are of Sanskrit origin, their presence in the Linotype
    list presumably reflecting those Sanskrit conjuncts that we most frequently encountered
    in words quoted by Linotype's Indian customers of the time. A few are what I consider
    'systematic inclusions', i.e. those whose existence is implied by the writing
    system rather than its application to a particular language, e.g. a merged rakar
    form of the nukta letters. The remainder are presumed to be transliteration and
    transcription forms for loan words, as requested by Linotype's customers. As noted
    by Uli, once you start including such forms, it becomes an open ended set, and
    the only way to constrain it is by frequency. But, of course, the frequency of
    foreign loan words depends entirely on the nature of the texts examined; which
    accounts for the differences between the Hunspell, Aspell and Linotype/Adobe sets.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'm left with is a set of data that includes a fairly large number of Hunspell
    and Aspell transliteration conjuncts that are not covered in the Adobe Devanagari
    set, and vice versa. The most useful aspect of this, at the moment, is that it
    suggests ways in which I might reduce the draft glyph set of a font I am working
    on for pre-modern Hindi texts, in which few loan words are expected to be encountered.
    For fonts targeting modern Hindi usage, the usefulness is less clear, but perhaps
    there might be candidates among the more common transliteration conjuncts from
    Hunspell and Aspell that could be added. On the other hand, I'm pleased to see
    just how many of the conjuncts not supported by ligatures in the Adobe Devanagari
    font shape very well with half forms (which we carefully kerned to that purpose).\r\n\r\nUli,
    you suggested early in this thread that the Adobe Devanagari set would need only
    about a dozen more ligatures in order to adequately support classical Sanskrit.
    This surprised me. The first document to which you linked in this discussion seems
    to be a subset of Sanskrit conjuncts, certainly much shorter than the complete
    list in your manual. Can you explain the basis of this subset? Is it based on
    frequency, or on a particular set of texts?"

  body: "Mr. Hudson:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Uli, you suggested early in this thread that the
    Adobe Devanagari set would need only about a dozen more ligatures in order to
    adequately support classical Sanskrit. This surprised me. The first document to
    which you linked in this discussion seems to be a subset of Sanskrit conjuncts,
    certainly much shorter than the complete list in your manual. Can you explain
    the basis of this subset? Is it based on frequency, or on a particular set of
    texts?\"</cite>\r\n\r\nThe first document, namely this document:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/adobe-ligatures.pdf\r\n\r\nlists
    attested Sanskrit conjuncts in descending frequency order.\r\n\r\nI cut off this
    partial list at the frequency of 0.010 %, namely here:\r\n\r\n\u0919\u094D\u0918\u094D\u0930\u094D\u092F\t\u1E45ghry
    (!!!)  0.010%\r\n\r\nIf the Adobe Devanagari font contained all attested Sanskrit
    ligatures down to a frequency of 0.010 %, it would be a very good Sanskrit font,
    although it would not include the rarest ligatures with a frequency below 0.010%.\r\n\r\nThese
    rarest ligatures are only covered by our own highly specialized Itranslator fonts
    \"Sanskrit2003.tt\", \"Chandas.ttf\" and \"Siddhanda.ttf\" downloadable here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the Adobe Devanagari font, primarily designed for Hindi, could be also a satisfactory
    Sanskrit font, if it contained a subset of Sanskrit ligatures, provided that at
    least the most frequent Sanskrit ligatures were covered by the subset.\r\n\r\nIt
    is up to you where you cut off the frequency list adobe-ligatures.pdf.\r\n\r\nFor
    example, given the present version of the Adobe Devanagari font, it contains all
    Sanskrit ligatures down to a frequency of 0.215%, because the first ligature not
    covered by this font is the ligature \u0926\u094D\u0927\u094D\u0935, namely\r\n\r\n\u0926\u094D\u0927\u094D\u0935\tddhv
    \ (!!!)  0.215%\r\n\r\nIf you were to include also \u0921\u094D\u0917, the Adobe
    Devanagari font would cover all Sanskrit ligatures down to a frequency of 0.167
    %, namely\r\n\r\n\u0921\u094D\u0917\t\u1E0Dg     (!!!)  0.167%\r\n\r\nand so on
    and so on. You could proceed and cut off here\r\n\r\n\u0926\u094D\u0926\u094D\u0935\tddv
    \ (!!!) \t0.119%, or here:\r\n\r\n\u0919\u094D\u0918\u094D\u0930\t\u1E45ghr\t(!!!)
    0.109%, or here:\r\n\r\n\u0926\u094D\u0926\u094D\u0930\tddr  (!!!)  0.109%, or
    here:\r\n\r\n\u0921\u094D\u092F\t\u1E0Dy\t(!!!)  0.097%, or here:\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\u0919\u094D\u0918\u094D\u0930\u094D\u092F\t\u1E45ghry
    (!!!)\t0.010%\r\n\r\nIf the Adobe Devanagari font included all ligatures down
    to \u0919\u094D\u0918\u094D\u0930\u094D\u092F, id est down to a frequency of 0.010%,
    it would be a very good Sanskrit font. But I repeat, you may cut off the list
    much earlier.\r\n\r\nAs regards the attestations, I made frequency analyses of
    original electronic Sanskrit files.\r\n\r\nThe German University of G\xF6ttingen
    hosts this huge collection of electronic Sanskrit files:\r\n\r\nhttp://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.htm\r\n\r\nTen
    years ago, I started with the proofread entire Mahabharata:\r\n\r\nhttp://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/statement.html\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it only makes sense to analyze proofread electronic texts:\r\n\r\nhttp://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/history.html\r\n\r\nbecause
    text files crammed with typos  result in erroneous frequency counts.\r\n\r\nFor
    making a good Hindi font, someone would have to analyze proofread electronic Hindi
    files and would have to make frequency counts. Thereafter it would become clear,
    which ligatures should be included into a good Hindi font and which should be
    omitted.\r\n\r\nI should like to mention that the German University of Cologne
    here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html\r\n\r\nhosts
    a huge electronic Sanskrit dictionary with more than 150,000 entries, which I
    also completely analysed for my own ligature frequency counts ten years ago.\r\n\r\nA
    similar electronic dictionary should also be available for Hindi. Mr. Boyer's
    short Hindi word files mentioned above in this thread are not sufficient for large-scale
    frequency counts."

  body: "For those who wonder how the statistics based on the dictionaries can be
    obtained, here is the method I used (using Python regular expressions).\r\n\r\nAs
    John said, a compound is a sequence of virama separated consonants. A consonant
    can be defined by the Python regular expression \r\n<pre>   [\\u0915-\\u0939\\u0958-\\u095F]</pre>
    \r\n(I just rewrote in Python what John wrote in words above). The Virama is \\u094D.
    A compound is thus a sequence of 1 or more  consonants followed by \\u094D (whence
    the + operator in the code below), with a consonant appended to it. For grouping,
    I used (?:expression) to avoid the back referencing mechanism. \r\n\r\nThe dictionary
    contains one word per line. The following program reads line per line, finds the
    compounds in each line, and outputs them directly.\r\n<pre>\r\nimport re, sys\r\n\r\ncompound
    = ur'(?:[\\u0915-\\u0939\\u0958-\\u095F]\\u094D)+[\\u0915-\\u0939\\u0958-\\u095F]'\r\nf=open(sys.argv[1])\r\nword
    = f.readline().decode('utf-8')\r\nwhile word:\r\n  for comb in re.findall(compound,
    word):\r\n    print comb.encode('utf-8')\r\n  word = f.readline().decode('utf-8')\r\n</pre>\r\nIf
    we call this stub <code>compounds.py</code> and if the dictionary is <code>aspell.txt</code>,
    then \r\n\r\n<pre>python compounds.py aspell.txt</pre> \r\n\r\noutputs the compounds
    (I should rather say the candidates for producing compounds), one per line, as
    many times as they occur. That should work on any platform.\r\n\r\nTo get a more
    sophisticated output, you can make a more involved Python program, or just use
    standard unix commands if you are on Linux or OS X. The first thing to do is to
    sort the compounds so that they are grouped together in the output and then use
    the unix command <code>uniq</code> with the option <code>-c</code> to count them.\r\n<pre>\r\npython
    compounds.py aspell.txt | sort | uniq -c\r\n</pre>\r\nHere are the first lines
    of the output:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n 223 \u0915\u094D\u0915\r\n   1 \u0915\u094D\u0915\u094D\u0915\r\n
    \  1 \u0915\u094D\u0915\u094D\u0921\u093C\r\n  32 \u0915\u094D\u0916\r\n</blockquote>\r\nSo
    there are 223 occurrences of \u0915\u094D\u0915. It would be interesting now to
    have those numbers is descending order. Again, all that is needed is to sort those
    last lines according to the numerical value (option <code>-n</code>) and I'll
    choose the reverse order (option <code>-r</code>). Here is the full command. \r\n<pre>\r\n%
    python compounds.py aspell.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r\r\n</pre>\r\nHere
    are the first lines of the output\r\n<blockquote>\r\n3200 \u092A\u094D\u0930\r\n1614
    \u0924\u094D\u0930\r\n1599 \u0915\u094D\u0937\r\n 961 \u0938\u094D\u0924\r\n 924
    \u0930\u094D\u0923\r\n</blockquote>\r\nOnce you know the compounds, you can search
    for the words containing them in the dictionary using the unix command <code>grep</code>.
    Very little programming is thus required. \r\n\r\nOf course, to produce a table
    for LaTeX, the compounds found were put in a Python dictionary and the processing
    was all done in Python. The full source is 39 lines of Python after removing comments
    and blank lines (but including the 8 lines above).\r\n\r\nMichel\r\nRem:  I removed
    duplicates in aspell after I produced my last tex files; the number of occurrences
    for \u0938\u094D\u0924 has decreased from 962  to 961."

    then limits ones ability to extend the language support of that type in future.
    Adobe Devanagari is a type that in its current version, as intended, supports
    modern Hindi usage. I think it highly likely that future versions will support
    Marathi and Nepali. Whether it will ever support a full range of Sanskrit typography,
    even Vedic, isn't obvious to me.

    Hindi publishing; there are other Sanskrit ligatures that are not. What LaTeX
    categorises as 'Modern Hindi' seems to me to represent particular technological
    limitations of some obsolete typesetting technology that needed to rely on half
    forms, post forms and explicit halant. I don't think there's anything particularly
    'modern' about it; indeed, it now looks to me old fashioned, like the non-kerning
    f of old Linotype faces.

  body: "I've taken some time to look a bit more deeply into this issue.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing I've found is that many Devanagari ligatures are formed by composing a version
    of a letter without a vertical stroke on the right, and many others are formed
    by stacking letters vertically.\r\n\r\nThis suggests that the total number of
    glyphs required for supporting a large selection of ligatures could be significantly
    reduced by composing these types of ligatures from their component parts.\r\n\r\n(EDIT:
    I see that this has been thought of, and still many ligatures need to be individually
    drawn - and that you and a colleague from Russia apparently have produced the
    only two complete - for classical Sanskrit - Devanagari fonts in existence!)\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing I noticed is the sad fate of the project to develop a font for the Sama
    Veda with what are apparently cantillation marks used for the Sama Gana. My advice
    would have been to release the preliminary font, and wait for the complaints to
    roll in - because, psychologically, while teaching you about how the less common
    marks are used may seem like work when you request it in the abstract, once people
    have a font in their hands that they would like to use, telling you how to fix
    it so they can use it better seems to them as though they're getting you to do
    the work.\r\n\r\nOn USENET, if you ask a question, you may not get an answer.

  body: "Yes, some conjuncts can be created from sequences of so-called half forms,
    and the OpenType Layout model for Devanagari enables this. [Unicode also provides
    a control character mechanism to force half forms if supported by the font; this
    can be used to override vertical conjuncts with horizontal layout.] If the sequences
    of half form(s) and full form are carefully kerned in the font, the result can
    be really quite acceptable. Quite a lot of rare conjuncts are displayed in this
    way with the Adobe Devanagari fonts, and one can't easily tell from the resulting
    typeform that one is looking at a half form sequence instead of a ligature (until,
    that is, one enters an ikar after them, because the variant width ikar selection
    currently only works with ligatures).\r\n\r\nNow, all that said, in some conjuncts,
    especially wide ones, a subtle reduction in the width of the component letters
    is desirable, and then in some cases modification of stroke weights to maintain
    an even colour on the page. Or some form of optical  correction of overlapping
    segments might be desirable. So half form sequences are not always the way to
    go.\r\n\r\n[As noted in this <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/95785#comment-520041\">other

    for effectively). If you do not have it, I would be happy to send it to you, but
    I am guessing that you know it.\r\n\r\nOver the past few days, I have been collating
    my draft Hindi glyph set specification with Ernst Tremel's list, with your higher
    frequency Sanskrit list, and with the Hunspell and Aspell frequency analysis that
    Michel did (the latter mostly useful in that it includes sample words that make
    it easy to determine whether a conjunct is found only in loan words). I have been
    performing a kind of triage, identifying conjuncts that could be removed from
    my glyph set spec. I thought I had identified 63 conjuncts that could be safely
    removed from a font that didn't aim to support modern loan words, e.g. a font
    for pre-modern literary Hindi, which is what I happen to be working on at the
    moment. I was happy with this number, but Fiona spotted one conjunct in this group
    that she recalled seeing in Sanskrit, so I decided to double check against your
    Sanskrit ligature list in the Itrans manual, and also against the Sa\u1E43yoga

    Sa\u1E43yoga Table but not in your Itrans list. These are (with my glyph names,

    at your ligature list, which is why I'm inclined to consider it reliable. But
    I am worried by so many conjuncts occurring in the Sa\u1E43yoga Table that are
    not in your list (and I am only showing here the intersection of the Table with
    those glyphs that I am considering removing from my spec; I believe there are
    additional conjuncts in the Table that are not in your list or in my spec).\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if you might be able to share any insight on these discrepancies? In the
    meantime, I will write to James Agenbroad, whom I know from Unicode circles, and
    will try to get a copy of the journal with his original collection."

  body: "Mr. Hudson:\r\n\r\n<strong>\"\u092C\u094D\u0928 | dBNa | Coulson\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
    Agenbroad collection is \"old hat\" to me.\r\n\r\nIn my comprehensive book <strong>\"Conjuncts
    Consonants in Sanskrit\"</strong>, which is an unpublished work according to German
    Copyright Law and according to the Revised Berne Convention and which I cannot
    yet make available to others prior to publication, I wrote this on the invented
    ligature \"bn\":\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Charles Wilkins (1808), Alix Desgranges (1845),
    M.R. Kale (1894), Richard Fick (1922), A.A. MacDonell (1926), H.M. Lambert (1953),
    Michael Coulson (1973) and Madhav M. Deshpande (1997) invented the conjunct consonant
    \"bn\". If \"bn\" were no invention, then a Sanskrit word would exist containing
    \"bn\". But there does not exist any such Sanskrit word. Therefore \"bn\" has
    been invented. Yet \"bn\" could occur in a foreign-language word, e.g. in \"abnormal\",
    inserted into Neo-Sanskrit texts. But serious scientific research on Sanskrit
    conjunct consonants must dismiss such \"abnormalities\".\"</cite>\r\n\r\nIf you
    search for \"bn\" in the huge Sanskrit dictionary file\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/reverse1.pdf\r\n\r\nyou
    will not find any Sanskrit words containing \"bn\"\r\n\r\nSince Sanskrit words
    with \"bn\" are non-existant, it does not make much sense to design the ligature
    \"bn\" for a Sanskrit font, because this ligature will never be used on account
    of the fact that Sanskrit words with \"bn\" do not exist.\r\n\r\nMore than 300
    of the approx. 1000 conjunct consonants, i.e. roughly 30% of the collection by
    Agenbroad, are entirely fictitious, <strong>as far as Sanskrit is concerned</strong>.
    \r\n\r\nSome of these 300 ligatures compiled by Mr. Agenbroad may occur in foreign-language
    loan words in Hindi and Marathi texts, but they definitely do not occur in ancient
    Sanskrit texts. That is for sure.\r\n\r\nIn the funny book \"Spoken Sanskrit\"
    edited by S. S. Janaki and published by the Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute
    in 1990, you will find a fictitious Sanskrit report on a tennis match at Wimbledon
    between Bj\xF6rn Borg and John McEnroe.\r\n\r\nFor typesetting the name \"Wimbledon\"
    in Devanagari, you could invent the ligature \"mbl\", and in fact, this invented
    ligature is contained in the Agenbroad collection and also contained in the book
    by Mariano Rampolla del Tindaro, Lingua Sanscrita, Romae 1936. But this does not
    mean that this entirely fictitious ligature \"mbl\" will ever be required for
    typesetting an ancient Sanskrit text, since there never existed a Sanskrit word
    containing \"mbl\". This is a fact which you can check yourself here:\r\n\r\nwww.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/reverse1.pdf\r\n\r\nor
    here:\r\n\r\nwww.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html\r\n\r\nDo
    <strong>substring</strong> search for \"bn\" and \"mbl\" on Cologne Digital Sanskrit
    Lexicon (166,434 entries). You will get no hits at all for these entirely fictitious
    ligatures.\r\n\r\nSo, why should you care to design fictitious ligatures for fictitious
    Sanskrit words?\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong>\r\n\r\nThe \"Samyoga table\" mentioned
    by Mr. Hudson is downloadable here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/sanskrit
    as file sktdoc.ps\r\n\r\nIf you convert this ps file to a pdf file, it will be
    searchable."

  body: Thank you for the detailed response, Uli. I had assumed that at least some
    of the Samyoga Table entries were 'fictitious', to use your term, either the result
    of loan words in Devanagari contexts that were not limited to Sanskrit, or of
    misreadings of manuscripts or poorly proofread texts. But you can perhaps appreciate
    my concern, as a non-Sanskritist, to find so many questionable entries. Thankfully,
    on my current project I have a number of Sanskritists to whom I will eventually
    be able to submit my Sanskrit glyph set for review. And I do plan to double-check
    against the Cologne Lexicon; thank you for this suggestion.

  body: "Mr. Hudson:\r\n\r\nHaving stated above on 4 Sep 2012:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Charles
    Wilkins (1808), Alix Desgranges (1845), M.R. Kale (1894), Richard Fick (1922),
    A.A. MacDonell (1926), H.M. Lambert (1953), Michael Coulson (1973) and Madhav
    M. Deshpande (1997) invented the conjunct consonant \"bn\". If \"bn\" were no
    invention, then a Sanskrit word would exist containing \"bn\". But there does
    not exist any such Sanskrit word. Therefore \"bn\" has been invented. Yet \"bn\"
    could occur in a foreign-language word, e.g. in \"abnormal\", inserted into Neo-Sanskrit
    texts. But serious scientific research on Sanskrit conjunct consonants must dismiss
    such \"abnormalities\".\"</cite>\r\n\r\nit seems to me that you and Mrs. Fiona
    are trying to find an attestation for the ligature \"bn\" in Sanskrit in order
    to prove that I am wrong.\r\n\r\nI should like to mention that you are not the
    first ones who tried to do that.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to me that Mrs. Fiona
    did not learn Sanskrit, otherwise she would not have said that\r\n\r\n\u0905\u092C\u094D\u0928\u093E\u092D\u0903
    =\"abn\u0101bha\u1E25\"\r\n\r\nwas given in the Monier-Williams dictionary. The
    usage of this dictionary is tricky and error-prone for non-Sanskritists. On page
    60, middle column, the main entry starts with \"ab-ja\" which is a compound in
    itself composed of \"ab\" (from \"ap\") + \"ja\". A few lines below, you see \"-n\u0101bha\"
    (and also \"-netra\").\r\n\r\nThe compound here must be build as \"abja-n\u0101bha\",
    and not as \"ab-n\u0101bha\", as was thought by Mrs. Fiona. But the correct compound
    \"abja-n\u0101bha\" does not contain the ligature \"bn\".\r\n\r\nTheoretically
    or \"exempli gratia\" or \"just for fun\", it would be possible to construct a
    Sanskrit compound word  containing the ligature \"bn\", for example the compound\r\n\r\n\u0905\u092C\u094D\u0928\u093F\u0930\u094D\u0935\u093E\u0923
    (= abnirv\u0101\u1E47a = \"the nirvana in the water\")\r\n\r\ninvented by me here
    exempli gratia. But you will never find any attestation for this compound.\r\n\r\nI
    do not deny that it is theoretically possible to find the combination \"bn\" in
    any old Sanskrit text, but none was found so far.\r\n\r\nThe statistics mathematician
    and font lover Luc  Devroye would say that from the probability point of view,
    the mathematical likelihood that a Sanskritist will ever need the ligature \"bn\"
    in a font for typesetting a real Sanskrit word is converging to \"zero\", \"nil\"
    or \"nought\".\r\n\r\nFor example, by analyzing Panini's grammar, I found exactly
    114 additional artificial ligatures pertaining to Panini's acronym-like grammatical
    elements. But I included none of these artificial acronym ligatures into my official
    ligature list here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf (page
    29 seq.)\r\n\r\nbecause none of these artificial acronym-like ligatures could
    be found in any ordinary Sanskrit text.\r\n\r\nAdditional note for scholars: \"abja-n\u0101bha\"
    occurs in the Bhagavata-Purana repeatedly. Hence it is an attested compound word."

  body: Uli, I am certainly <em>not</em> setting out to prove that you are wrong.
    And neither I nor Fiona singled out the bn conjunct ligature for attention. I
    am whittling away at a list of dubious conjuncts and this one happened to be unique
    in that we found it used in Lambert's book and apparently in Monier-Williams,
    and I posted a message about it here not to prove you wrong but because I wanted
    your opinion on it. Why? Because I value your opinion on matters Sanskrit, and
    you can usually explain oddities in a reasonable and convincing manner. In other
    words, I asked because I consider you likely to be <em>right,</em> not wrong.

    of the things I have noticed is that grammars of the <em>writing</em> of Sanskrit,

    of the writing system independent of its application to the actual language. Hence,
    as Uli notes, one can find many listings of conjuncts that are not attested in
    actual texts. Some of these 'systematic inclusions' may end up being used in foreign
    loanwords, or in the orthographies of other languages adopting the script, but
    will never occur in Sanskrit. This is why Uli's work analysing frequency in proofread
    Sanskrit texts is so useful."

  body: "I have stepped over this discussion on Adobe Devanagari only recently and
    would like to add a few comments. But first let me say, while I admit that there
    is place for improvement, Adobe Devanagari was exactly what I needed and came
    right in time for a bilingual edition of Hindi short stories accompanied by German
    translations I am working at.\r\n\r\n(1) Most of the joint letters (ligatures)
    Uli took offense at are in actual use in Hindi, Marathi and Nepali. Both in novels
    and newspapers it is quite common to transliterate words and even complete sentences
    from English into Devanagari. It took me only a few seconds to think for possible
    candidates: \r\n\u0915\u094D\u0938\u094D\u092A\u094D\u0930 kspr: express (extremely
    common, there are hundreds of trains with that name, no \"ink-spray\" necessary)\r\n\u0915\u094D\u0938\u094D\u092A\u094D\u0932
    kspl: explain\r\nalso things like \u0928\u094D\u092B\u093C\u094D\u0930 nfr: conference
    (which happily have been included)\r\nPlease, Adobe, don\u2019t remove these ligatures
    whatever Sanskritists may think about them, there is much practical publishing
    experience behind most of the list.\r\n\u092C\u094D\u0928 is common in Nepali
    (e.g. \u0921\u0941\u092C\u094D\u0928\u0941 drown)\r\n\r\n(2) Adobe Devanagari
    goes a long way even in Sanskrit and Vedic. Modern editions don\u2019t have all
    the traditional ligatures used in manuscripts as they tend to turn out clumsy
    in print. \r\nIt would be fine some time to have Samavedic accents too (so far
    only Rigvedic accents are available). \r\nAccent combinations for transliteration
    of Vedic (\u0101\u0301 \u0101\u0300 etc) are also missing.\r\nBut then, even Rome
    wasn\u2019t built in one day.\r\n\r\n(3) Language codes and stylistic sets should
    be enabled for much more alternatives than they are now. InDesign CS6 has a language
    tag for Hindi, but not for Sanskrit (on the internet, you can find a clumsy way
    to get it, but I did not try).\r\n\r\n(4) For the time being, while the font claims
    to be primarily made for modern Hindi, the ligatures you get by default (letter
    + halant + letter) are quite often the traditional rather than the modern forms,
    the latter preferring half letters. To get theses, you have to type an additional
    non width joinder. Compare:\r\n\u0915 + \u0915 : \u0915\u094D\u0915 (old style)
    \    \u0915\u094D\u200D\u0915 (modern)   visible only in Adobe Devanagari\r\n\u0928
    + \u0928 : \u0928\u094D\u0928  (old style)     \u0928\u094D\u200D\u0928 (modern)
    \   visible only in Adobe Devanagari\r\n\u0936 + \u0935 : \u0936\u094D\u0935  (old
    style)     \u0936\u094D\u200D\u0935 (modern)\r\nIt would be a good idea to handle
    this issue by different stylistic sets and/or language tags.\r\nI would appreciate
    to have Sanskrit, Hindi (traditional ligatures), Hindi (modern ligatures), Marathi
    & Nepali (for the latter two languages, automatical creation of e.g. \u0930\u094D\u200D\u092F
    ry and the like where needed would be very helpful)\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think
    that John\u2019s commentary on this point is correct. The modern half forms are
    really \u2018modern\u2019 (in Hindi!), not just a compromise with dated technology:
    they are used in contemporary print because they are more legible than the traditional
    manuscript ligatures and therefore even recommended for e.g. text books. The comparison
    with the old Linotype-f is misleading; rather one should consider the whole paraphernalia
    of Greek ligatures used in Byzantine manuscripts which hardly any font for classical
    Greek does include as they are no longer used in print, again for the simple reason
    of legibility (Claude Garamond did use them, and there are two or three fonts
    around that have a lot of them \u2013 but in a stylistic set you have to turn
    on if you want to have them!)\r\n\r\n(5) The short i-matra extends by default
    over the complete consonant combination it precedes:\r\n\u0915\u093F but \u0915\u094D\u0937\u094D\u092E\u093F
    \ (only visible in Adobe Devanagari). This seems sometimes a bit to much, so it
    would be fine if there were an option to turn the feature off or reduce the it
    to a more moderate size \u2013 say by an option like swash letters or titling
    caps (But then, Adobe can be adamant, as with the Th-ligature in all of Slimbach\u2019s
    fonts).\r\n\r\nps.: I hope the Devanagari samples are readable, as I don\u2019t
    have the time to prepare and include graphics. If not, copy the text and paste
    it into a Unicode-savvy Word processor and formate the whole section with Adobe
    Devanagari, Devanagari MT, Kokila or any other new Devanagari font."

    are met in 14 out of 15 sources (a maximum). The list is even bigger than Mr.

    owe much to Ulrich. His work is known and used wider even than Ernst Tremel's.
    I would love to see a version of his \"entirely fictitious ligature\" list for
    Sanskrit. Nothing remained the same\r\n<cite>Rigveda edition by Prof. R. L. Kashyap
    and Prof. S. Sadagopan published in printed book form in 1998</cite> \r\nafter
    he started his research on devanagari typography, of which a culmination was his
    replica of Bombay's Nirnayasagar's bold type called [[http://www.omniglot.com/blog/?p=621|Sanskrit
    2003]]. One would love to see a \"Sanskrit 2013\" (ten years after) with OpenType
    variants included for ligatures and vowels.\r\n\r\nEven though I have personal
    reasons for not loving Ulrich Stiehl, I must admit that he knows more about the
    technical part of a Sanskrit font than any German knows. I could say that more
    than any European, but there is Mihas Bayaryn, so you can't be #1 until Mihas
    is alive. And seems he is here to stay. A pitty all http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/
    URLs have died.\r\n\r\n<cite>These rarest ligatures are only covered by our own
    highly specialized Itranslator fonts \"Sanskrit2003.tt\", \"Chandas.ttf\" and
    \"Siddhanda.ttf\" downloadable here\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/</cite>
    \r\n\r\nSiddhanda.ttf is and I hope never will downloadable at Ulrich's website.
    Chandas.ttf indeed is, \r\nbut as per Mihas (author of the font), he treats Chandas
    as a draft for Siddhanta.\r\n\r\n<cite>by analyzing Panini's grammar, I found
    exactly 114 additional artificial ligatures pertaining to Panini's acronym-like
    grammatical elements</cite>\r\nAs said it would be interesting to see the context
    and the ligatures, so one could check how they where printed in the 1887 edition
    printed at Drugulin. I have a list of Drugulin's devanagari from an archive with
    425 elements, including ligatures (one would have to add - only). Still no better
    Sanskrit typography was ever printed that the one of Drugulin.\r\n\r\nSame as
    Ulrich I deal with Sanskrit on a daily basis. And as Indians do not make Sanskrit
    fonts, Germans and Russians have to do so. It might sound strange, but even the
    original Nirnaya is based on a Berlin-made font from Uengern brothers. Schlegel
    was a German if I'm not wrong. Frutiger was an Indian only a bit - so there is
    not much of Indian in the history of Indian fonts. [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/uyvF2nK92J0|Indians
    are above fonts]]. They care about the text, to preserve the manuscripts. Errors?
    Typoes? Who cares. Virama-ligatures in a Sanskrit conference thesis? So be it.
    \"We\" are above it. Oh, really?!\r\n\r\nAfter we had years to fight with \"Mangal\",
    which was a makeshift font including only the \"commonest conjuncts\" (using Ulrich's
    expression), I understand why Ulrich does not feels comfortable with the Adobe
    Devanagari (John Hudson's) policy. I understand that Adobe's policy is above Mr.
    Hudson's. But not having Marathi or Nepali in the next edition would not have
    any excuses, I guess. Sanskrit is Huge. Marathi is just a feature compared to
    the complexity of Sanskrit ligatures.\r\n\r\n@John Hudson \r\nWould it ever be
    possible to make at least a few screencasts of your work with VOLT showing the
    font process working with devanagari? There is next to nothing documented and
    a video would be something appreciated indeed.\r\n<cite> Can you explain the basis
    of this subset? Is it based on frequency, or on a particular set of texts?</cite>
    \r\nWhen Ulrich asked you, he meant, that nothing of it is used. It's strange
    indeed. If you take something for granted (a list not of your own), you have to
    have samples in what words do they occur. For example, one can not  make a universal
    Sanskrit font, every font will work only with a limited (small or huge) amount
    of texts. At GRETIL, with which most of the Sanskritists are working nowadays,
    there are around 600 texts. \r\nBut Ulrich's list is not a list of ligatures in
    all GRETIL's 600 texts (as he states in different wording himself). He has dropped
    out the grammatical literature with it's anubandhas. So you can not print an Indian
    grammar or might experience issues - because grammar is not a text he would want
    to include. Mihas' font Siddhanta is the first one to include the grammarians
    only ligatures as well, because Mihas himself is rooted deep in the Paninian system.
    I'm working on a Dhatupatha Concordance and must say, that from the technological
    point of view no devanagari font comes even close. I'm not a fan of it's thin
    as hair stylistics, I'm used to the bold types.\r\n\r\n<cite> Coulson, Michael.
    Teach yourself Sanskrit.\r\nMonier-Williams. A practical grammar of the Sanskrit
    Language.\r\nVasu, S.C. A\u1E63\u1E6D\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012B of P\u0101\u1E47ini.\r\nAgenbroad,
    J.E. 'Difficult characters: a collection of Devanagari conjunct consonants' (in
    Bulletin 38 of the International Association of Orientalist Librarians).</cite>
    \r\nCoulson's list a very small one. It has 1 variant for every ligature, which
    means it is a poorly made list. Why on earth one would want to take it in consideration
    at all? Monier-Williams has around 170 000 Sanskrit words (even if put together
    with other Sanskrit dictionaries it would be around 200 000 so a relatively small
    number). Vasu's A\u1E63\u1E6D\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012B is the most authoritative
    edition of P\u0101\u1E47ini. But are the anubandhas from Dhatupatha included?
    Never seen Agenbroad's list, so can't comment on it. Is there a scan of it available
    somewhere, gentlemen? Mr. Hudson, when you wrote \"get a copy of the journal with
    his original collection\" - did you have any luck with it?\r\n\r\n@quadibloc \r\nIt
    does not matter that \"OCR software is oriented around the Latin alphabet\". The
    Cologne project had Indians working (not Frenchmen) on the proofreading but there
    are thousands of errors left. I've been submitting my five cents every few months,
    but it would take around 50 years to fix all of them at such a rate. And there
    are several editions of the OCR texts from Cologne - not always newer is better,
    new errors arive as well (because of converting to the new markup as well). Anyway
    - nobody else has done even 1/10 of they've done so you can't say a single bad
    word about them. One heels only gratitude and can't say enough \"thank you\"\r\nAfter
    all those OCRs where done http://www.indsenz.com/int/index.php was released. It
    was unreliable in the beginning. But as of 2013 it has a very small error rate
    and is the best OCR software for devanagari. ABBYY Fine Reader (a trained one)
    does not comes even close. No other (inlcuding Indian coders) comes close. I've
    explored the OCR market, I know what I speak about.\r\n\r\n@Rainer \r\n(1) agreed.
    \r\n(2) Samavedic accents from Adobe - you made my day. They can't make a feature
    for a single text if they have no features for hundreds of other (more popular)
    texts. That would not make much logic. Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day - but
    the building of a devanagari at Adobe is only in the plans, as regarding Sanskrit.
    I must say I'm impressed by the look and feel of the font except the details as
    screenshoted http://samskrtam.ru/adobe-devanagari-font/\r\n(3)  \"language tag
    for Hindi, but not for Sanskrit\" - indeed.\r\n(4) \"font claims to be primarily
    made for modern Hindi, the ligatures you get by default (letter + halant + letter)
    are quite often the traditional rather than the modern forms\" - so if it's Hindi,
    be it Hindi by default. Kill every Sanskritism and we'll accept that we should
    not even try to print a Sanskrit text. If it's in between - that's worse.\r\n(5)
    As per short i-matra that \"extends by default over the complete consonant combination
    it precedes\" - I fully agree. There must be a way to turn it off. Sometimes it
    can become too long. Adobe's Devanagari is not the first one to have it, but when
    it's too long is looks ugly in every print, be it old or new.\r\n(6) As per \"modern
    half forms are really \u2018modern\u2019 (in Hindi!), not just a compromise with
    dated technology\" - that's an interesting and new insight.\r\n\r\nIf one only
    could add screenshots and include attachments I could show the Ligature Concordance
