  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Microsoft published a public beta version of their new Office 2007 suite for Windows.</p>
<p>One interesting point is that Office 2007 includes all the OpenType fonts from the Microsoft ClearType collection (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/design/ClearType.html">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/design/ClearType.html</a> ):  Calibri, Cambria, Candara, Consolas, Constantia, Corbel, as well as Segoe UI, Microsoft&rsquo;s new user interface font that was disputed to be a Frutiger rip-off. All the fonts include Latin, Cyrillic and Greek characters with advanced typographic OpenType features, some include characters from additional scripts.</p>
<p>One highlight of Office 2007 is the new math typesetting engine in Word. It consists of the Cambria font that has a large mathematical character set, and a fully new &ldquo;equation editor&rdquo; which is seamlessly integrated into new Office applications and allows mathematical input using various text encoding schemes, including a syntax very similar to TeX as well as MathML.</p>
<p>The current beta version of Office 2007 will run until February 2007 and is available free of charge to anyone interested:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/default.mspx</a></p>
<p>(The download is rather large though, at least 450 MB).</p>

Adam</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>from Adam&rsquo;s email to the OpenType list: &ldquo;Unfortunately, neither Word nor PowerPoint 2007 seem to be actually using any of the user-controlled OpenType features included in these fonts (such as smcp, onum, ss01, hist , dlig, swsh etc.). For example, &ldquo;small caps&rdquo; in Word 2007 still produces fake small caps. I guess this means that we won&rsquo;t see support for user-controlled OpenType Layout features in Office within the next four-five years or so, which is a pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than a pity, but what can you do? I guess Microsoft thinks they can do whatever they want when they want. It&rsquo;d be great if one of the freesource office packages would implement OT layout feature support before they got it into Word and then caught on with the public. Ah well, i can dream, can&rsquo;t i?</p>

<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that. This version of Office really has very dramatic changes in handling graphics, the user interface, interoperability between the applications, and the file format. I guess there was not enough power and time left for them to deal with typography on top of that.</p>

While a picture is worth a thousand words, I still feel that text is the medium, and the main focus of their office packages, that passes the imformation to the reciprient. More time should have been given to this area even before a beta was released. Of course the mathematical equation editor will more than adequately compensate for poor type handling.</div>

<p>I definitely agree that improvement in text handling should have been the main focus of Word. Since the file format is changing and many other things are happening, it would have been a good chance to revamp the typographic support. With all those changes, issues of document reflow would have been acceptable, I think. Of course, Word does support OpenType Layout in principle. The Arabic/Indic stuff, composition/decomposition and the math stuff all works using OpenType Layout. But we’d appreciate support at least for contextual alternates, standard ligatures, small caps, superscripts/subscripts and perhaps alternate figure styles.</p>

<p>hmmm&hellip; I guess i should have looked at the new applications first. I&rsquo;m just baffled by the seeming diconnect where Microsoft pays big $$$ to develop feature-rich OT ClearType fonts, and then does nothing to implement layout feature support in their basic applications (MS Office). I guess I&rsquo;m disappointed, because it is my belief that OT will not really catch on with the general public until they have a chance to see what it can do for THEM. For a majority of PC users, this means that standard programs (such as Office) must support the layout features. I guess we have to wait 2-3 more years to get the word out about what <em>we</em>&rsquo;ve been doing now for several now.</p>

<p>The discrepancy of fonts that offer OT features and applications that ignore them is really astonishing. I also agree on the second point &ndash; OpenType will have its breakthrough not before Windows &amp; Office applications make it available to literally everybody. Apple&rsquo;s own OpenType support in OSX 10.4 is rather infant too, no contextual substitution. And unless at least the major system and application developers offer text engines which give same results, and more consistent user interfaces to access typographic features, OpenType will remain a toy of a few nerds.</p>

<p>Microsoft isn&rsquo;t the only game in town.
Myfonts reaches a broader market than the design industry (such clear-cut disctinctions are becoming obsolete, anyway), and its marketing sophistication is growing. Now indie foundries can launch new fonts there, advertise them on &ldquo;posters&rdquo;, with time-limited special offers, and hype OpenType features as product benefits, and it&rsquo;s already worked for at least one typeface. The missing link here is an adequate interactive online &ldquo;type tester&rdquo; which shows the different OT features that a font may have; once that is in place at online font distributors, then we will see a real breakthrough.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Nick! I think the decision of acceptance or non-acceptance of OpenType is made by systems and applications, not by fonts. As long as only a handful of special interest apps (Creative Suite, XPress, Mellel)* give access to typographic features, a font tester could be helpful but would have the taste of a test tube. However, if applications would show these options in their interfaces, one could try them in documents one creates anyway, and maybe find them be USEFUL. And finally ask how it comes that some fonts DON&rsquo;T have these features.
So, I appreciate a lot that Microsoft added typographic features to ClearType fonts, and find it the more disappointing that they &ldquo;hide&rdquo; them in their own applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yesterday I wanted to add Apple&rsquo;s OSX 10.4 apps to the list but then recognized some serious shortcomings. One would have to explain for every single feature: this works, this doesn&rsquo;t. Then better not mention them at all &hellip;</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Karsten.
The distinction is between a dominant corporation, Microsoft, not pushing the use of OpenType&rsquo;s &ldquo;typographic&rdquo; features, and the market, using OT-supporting Adobe applications (and now Quark), pulling it. 
Even though Adobe doesn&rsquo;t mention type on its home page, its applications which support OT features are used by millions of people &ndash; many of whom are not professional designers.</p>
<p>The way I understand it (from a MS video documantary), Bill Gates' support of funding for the ClearType project was predicated on the type making a difference (or some such words), ie something that could be measured. Hence the readability claims of 5% faster for CT. The multi-language support of CT is a no-brainer for a multi-national corporation. The &lsquo;typographic&quot; features of CT &ndash; now how would they be justified to engineering and marketing criteria? It seems they were snuck in. Perhaps the rationale was keeping pace with Adobe.</p>

<p>Seriously, is it really much improved and user

<p>I think it&rsquo;s at least interesting. I had to do some looking around in the new UI of Word to find what I wanted but once that is done, I believe the new UI is more productive. They have done good work, especially the live preview stuff is very impressive (you hover the mouse over the font size or name and the entire layout of the page changes to show you what it will look like, same for table styles etc.). Excel&rsquo;s new charting features and table auto-formatting is also very pleasant. They have actually hired designers to do it this time. I&rsquo;m not entirely fond of the new graphic treatment of the UI but I think I&rsquo;ll get used to it. It&rsquo;s better than the cheesy Windows XP user interface.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve seen where the Windows Vista UI is heading and it&rsquo;s a nightmare. Not only it&rsquo;s completely different from Office 2007, it&rsquo;s also an overcomplicated mess.</p>

<p>It is my impression that small caps a still often used in display, eg on book covers. I think they are a very valuable option for the designer. What are others' impression of how often small caps are used?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Demand for this feature among Word
users must be almost zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way word is set up&ndash;with easy short cuts for italic, bold, but not small caps&ndash;discourages their use. Also that they are quite often fake (are they always?), and don&rsquo;t look so great would further discourage their use. If they were good and easily accessible, they might be used often for display, at the very least, by Word users.</p>

A few years back pictures were not available in word processors either.  The developers did not add them because their data showeed that users used them already, they did it to offer a feature which was new to the program.  If you build it, they will come. Today word files are riddled with a bonanza of clip art and other visual splendors.  I wish they would add a new feature to Word files called &ldquo;DeCrappify&rdquo; which would delete all the visual kaka and plain vanilla the formatting but keep italics and bolds. Adding small caps and OSF would actually help editors communicate with designers though and actually make work flow easier.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the Word 2007 default dashboard. As you can see, you can get Bold, italic, strikethrough, superiors, inferiors, change case all from easy to access buttons (albeit faux formatting in some cases). There should be a smallcaps and and all caps button right there. As it is, you have to click on the tiny link on the font menu to access these formatting options and in the case of smallcaps, these are faux smallcaps. I think if we gave easier access to real formatting, we would see (somewhat) more typographically sophisticated Word documents.</p>

<p>To the right people. Which is why if/when you

<blockquote>
<p>Small caps are used by the publishing/design community on page layout apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Few of them. Fake smallcaps (including when the font has smallcaps available <cite>right there in the computer</cite>) are the crushing majority, whether in small projects or large ones - like the monumental lettering on new buildings at UCLA, or around the &ldquo;display fountain&rdquo; at Paseo Colorado. One single jet in that fountain costs more than doing proper smallcaps, but it just doesn&rsquo;t happen. Education has to come first. Until then, you shoot for the pinnacle of users only.</p>

Unfortunately there are some serious issues. Like you said there&rsquo;s not access to advanced features, no use of real small-caps whether it is throught font variant or OT feature. There are still only 4 styles (mixed up with weights) recognized.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I suppose Word will always pander to the lowest common denominator in this way simply because practically everybody has/uses it. And if everybody has/uses it, it&rsquo;s perfect for files that lots of people work on and then send around amongst each other. To do a document in Quark or InDesign it&rsquo;s assumed you care about design (to do a document in TeX it&rsquo;s assumed you care about technical accuracy); but the greater the number of people working on a Word file, the greater the likelihood that some of them don&rsquo;t care about design and/or know how best to use Word&rsquo;s features to achieve good design.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Small caps&rsquo; control has been around for ages, even if it does apply faux small caps and is not smart enough to know when real ones are installed (either as OT features or in a separate font file), but like many other potentially useful features it&rsquo;s not on the default formatting toolbar so a lot of non-expert users know nothing about it. It would also help if the default formats of the styles &ldquo;Heading 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Heading 3&rdquo; etc were a little less ghastly.</p>
<p>Perhaps the installation routine should include a dialog box saying &ldquo;Do you give a rat&rsquo;s nipple about typographical design?&rdquo; and if you say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; it switches on kerning, and visibility of non-printing characters, and &lsquo;do-full-justification-like-wordperfect-6.x-for-Windows&rsquo; and only gives you bold/italic/smallcaps options if there are appropriate variants available (and, when used, the buttons automatically apply an &lsquo;emphasis&rsquo; or &lsquo;strong&rsquo; character style or whatever), and switches OFF all autoformatting options and&hellip; well you get the idea. And if you say &ldquo;No&rdquo; it says &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; and links you to a copy of Bringhurst on Amazon.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be specific here: the Microsoft <em>Office</em> group has made a decision not to add OpenType Layout support for quality typography in European scripts in this version, despite the efforts of a lot of people within Microsoft to persuade them otherwise. I&rsquo;m very frustrated about this. [Support for OpenType Layout for complex script shaping in Office, on the other hand, has been far ahead of any major competition for years: the multilingual aspects of OpenType are very much supported.]</p>
<p>But one shouldn&rsquo;t represent Microsoft as some kind of giant monolithic entity. The major program groups within Microsoft operate in many respects like separate companies.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s obvious. Even within &ldquo;monolithic&rdquo; companies there are different opinions, often contradictory. It&rsquo;s naiive to think otherwise. Decisions are not made by companies, they&rsquo;re always made by specific managers responsible for specific things.</p>
<p>I agree with John that the lack of support for user-controlled OpenType Layout typographic features in Office 2007 is a big disappointment.</p>

<p>grab the fonts somewhere, and keep using Office 2003 unless you really have to use the 2007 version now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Word 2007 for some two months now, with some pain. The look of the user interface is actually insulting, and the way the new UI operates is inconsistent, confusing and annoying. Most VBA extensions don&rsquo;t work (e.g. my Duden spelling checker for German). The default text styles use the new ClearType fonts but apart from that are hell ugly, and on top of that modifying existing styles is actually even more complicated than it was in earlier versions. There are a few nice schickschnacks about the new Word but most of it is, mildly put, underdeveloped.</p>
<p>Excel is a different story &ndash; I do enjoy the functionality improvements there, though again, the new look is extremely pretentious. I have not looked at PowerPoint since I don&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>Ah&hellip; The world would be perfect if Apple hired some good software developers and if Microsoft hired some good designers.</p>
