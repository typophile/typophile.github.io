body: "Help!  I'm going to go nuts if I need to create another document with TNR.
  \ I do some web design, but I'm a definite tyro when it comes to type.\r\n\r\nI
  need a serif font face to replace TNR in legal pleadings filed in federal court.
  \ Requirements are: screen (adobe PDF, embedded fonts) and print on standard copy
  paper using modern monochrome laser printers.  We are on Windows using Corel WordPerfect
  X3 (if that matters).  We need to use 13, maybe 14 point.  We don't need sans.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I'm looking for is a font that is conservative yet elegant, if modern not edgy,
  and very legible.  Shouldn't be too antique or call undue attention to itself if
  you are a judge used to looking at TNR.  We use italics a lot for case cites, and
  they shouldn't be too florid.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm aiming for is something that just
  gives a slightly fresher, more refined look.  Something that you wouldn't immediately
  notice but somehow are pleased to see.  Perhaps the reader wouldn't even register
  if they're not into such things, but would just feel the document has a fresher
  look.\r\n\r\nSome things I came across during reading and searches: ITC Stone Serif,
  Adobe Caslon, Minion, Whitman, Augereau, MVB Verdigris, Albertina.\r\n\r\nMaybe
  I'm way off base with these, and can't afford to buy them all to give them a go!\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much for any suggestions or advice.  Let me know if I can provide any other info.
  \ Save me from the sameness of TNR!"

  body: "Many very beautiful fonts really aren't suitable for workhorse legal work,
    but sometimes you don't find that out until you've spent money for them (I've
    learned that lesson the hard way).  Since you're using WordPerfect, you need a
    font whose default figures are lining figures, rather than old style (the same
    would be true if you used Microsoft Word, which likewise doesn't really support
    OpenType features), because legal citations in old style figures look weird, and
    shout \"I'm using a different font.\"  That leaves out Georgia and Verdigris,
    and other fonts I like that others haven't mentioned (e.g., Kingfisher, Berling
    Nova and Dolly).  I think you'll find that Whitman has too small an x-height;
    that problem also disqualifies a host of other fonts (e.g., Bembo Book, Mrs. Eaves).
    \ Porchez Le Monde Livre is really good, but has a killer flaw:  the godawful
    pilcrow (paragraph mark).  One of the problems with Times New Roman is that it's
    too condensed to work well in the 6.5 inch double-spaced lines lawyers have to
    use, so Minion, which is just as condensed as Times New Roman, is not a good choice,
    either.\r\n\r\nSabon LT is decent, arguably your best choice.  Sabon Next is even
    better, but it isn't worth the exorbitant cost.  Both Sabons may be half a tad
    too condensed.  I really like Meridien, but its \"french style\" ampersand may
    stand out too much.  I use it anyway.  Also, I find that Meridien Regular is a
    tad too light, and Meridien Medium two tads too dark.  But if you can stand that
    ampersand, it would be my personal recommendation.  I was working with a Chicago
    lawyer on a federal appellate brief once, and he was so impressed with my draft
    in Meridien that he had his secretary buy its Bitstream clone, Latin 725, on Ebay
    to use in his own briefs (he wasn't willing to spring the extra cost for real
    Meridien, which you can get from both Adobe and Linotype).  Another decent choice
    (really!), if you aren't plagued with negative memories of childhood adventures
    with Dick and Jane, is Century Schoolbook (or one of the innumerable other variants
    of Century).  The U.S. Supreme Court uses Century and Century Schoolbook, and
    so those fonts may have a subliminal \"authoritativeness\" that helps.   7th Circuit
    Judge Frank Easterbrook, who wrote the typeface rules in FRAP 32, tends in the
    direction of being a typeface junkie, and he recommends Century/Century Schoolbook
    (and also specifically recommends that you not use TNR).  And Palatino Linotype
    is probably the best choice among the fonts that came with your PC, although I
    find it a tad too dark.  (One odd thing--Century Schoolbook is darker than Palatino,
    as you can see if you place samples side-by-side, but by itself Palatino can look
    too dark, whereas CS usually doesn't.  I have no idea why that is the case, but
    that's my experience).  Georgia would be really good, too, but for the expletive
    deleted OSF default.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the extra-cost Windows screen font for
    Meridien is well worth it.  It's an outstanding screen font.  Many nice fonts
    are somewhat sucky on screen in WordPerfect or Word, and that can be grating if
    you have to use one all the time, even if the printed result is just fine.  For
    example, Kingfisher (which is not for you, since its default figures are OSF,
    and it's also exorbitantly expensive) looks way better printed than it does on
    screen.\r\n\r\n  "

  body: "I have admired books set in Dante, and speculated that it might be good for
    legal use.  Indeed, I originally turned to Meridien because it looked so good
    in my copy of the Illiad and happened to be identified in the fine print on the
    copyright page (I wish more publishers did that).  Dante may be just great, but
    I've never bought it, and I know from experience that a font that at first or
    even second glance seems like it would work well in legal usage sometimes just
    doesn't.  I spent a bundle on Bembo Book, and a bigger bundle on Le Monde Livre,
    only to find out that they just don't work for federal appellate briefs (or at
    least, in the case of Le Monde, don't work in briefs that use the pilcrow character).\r\n\r\nBut
    Dante may well be a contender.  I've also suspected that House's Paperback might
    be good, but it's rather pricey, and so I've never bought it.\r\n\r\nI continue
    to insist that Minion's too condensed, just as Times New Roman is.  But you could
    use WordPerfect's letterspacing function to stretch it out, I suppose.  Actually,
    that is what the Tenth Circuit does with Times New Roman in its slip opinions.

    you could get at the non-default lining figures in some OpenType fonts.  But you
    could buy several normally-priced fonts for the same price.  And InDesign is a
    bitch for a neophyte to learn to use.  Worse, your chances of finding a legal
    secretary who knows how to use it are slim to none--most of 'em can't make full
    use of Word or WordPerfect."

  body: I meant to add that the Adobe EULA allows you to modify the fonts. This means
    that, in theory, you can have someone change the default figs for you. Depending
    on the foundry you  might also just ask them if they could change the default
    for you. Note that Adobe doesn't do alterations, but you can hire someone else
    to do it for you and you are within your rights.

  body: "My copy of Minion Pro has lining figures as the default.  I just ran a side-by-side
    comparison with TNR, and not only is Minion's horizontal compression almost identical
    to TNR, but the x-height is considerably smaller.\r\n\r\nLegal briefs typically
    need relatively spread-out fonts with fairly large x-heights, because with few
    exceptions (the U.S. Supreme Court being the only one that comes to mind), under
    most Court rules small format pages are no longer permitted (8.5 X 11 is required),
    and \"double spacing\" is mandated.  In most courts the rules have developed from
    rules aimed at briefs produced by typewriters.  And many courts require 1 inch
    margins.  So, the way that Microsft Word works, most legal secretaries preparing
    briefs pick \"double spacing\" and end end up with, say, lines of 13 pt. type,
    85 or 90 characters per line, spaced vertically at maybe 29 pt intervals.  (Actually,
    if the Court rules permit it, they're likely to pick 12 point TNR, as a leftover
    from when the rules required use of \"Pica\" typewriting).  This produces a page
    with way, way too much white space, and way too many characters per line.  Picking
    a compressed font, or one with a small x-height, just makes things worse.\r\n\r\nWorse,
    in many courts (not the federal appellate courts, thank God!), there are length
    limitations expressed in pages, rather than in characters, so there's an incentive
    to go with a compressed font to squeeze more into a brief that would otherwise
    go over the page limit.\r\n\r\nAnd, believe it or not, there are still a handful
    of states in which court rules make Courier mandatory!\r\n\r\nSo it's hardly surprising
    that the overwhelming majority of legal briefs are typographically awful.  I doubt
    that Century Schoolbook is on the list of personal faves of most of this forum's
    members, but, really and truly, when the rules permit it, it's one of the best
    choices.\r\n\r\nIn the U.S. Supreme Court, the rules are quite a bit different,
    and left over from the days of hot metal.  As you might suspect, this makes Supreme
    Court briefs aesthetically vastly superior.  The format is small--the pages are
    6.125 x 9.25 inches, type size must be 11 point or larger, with leading of 2 points
    or more, and margins of at least .75 inches.  The Supreme Court rules say that
    \"the typeface used should be similar to that used in current volumes of the United
    States Reports (that is, Century).  Few law firms do these briefs in house any
    more, and I'd guess that 95% of the briefs filed in that court are done by just
    three or four printing firms.  I'd guess that maybe 65% of 'em use Century, 30%
    use Palatino, and 5% something else.  The front cover often has the \"Supreme
    Court of the United States\" in Blackletter, although that's not required.\r\n\r\nSo
    when gtcaz asks for help with federal court briefs, you have to understand that
    the best anyone can recommend will still break many of the rule of good design
    that you learned at design school or read in Bringhurst.  It's really a question
    of making a \"normal\" brief look less bad, rather than making it look good.\r\n\r\n"
