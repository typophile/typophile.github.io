body: "I would appreciate your ideas on suitable fonts for a project to do with the
  history of art and architecture that is set in the 15th-century Rome but also extends
  to the Christian Orient, for example to Armenia and Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nThe output
  will be both for the screen (moving images and interactive) and print. I am hoping
  for a selection of options, something simple and readable for text/headings and
  something more old-looking/idiosyncratic for maps and images. The body text font
  will need to have extended pro features.\r\n\r\nApart from the font names, any links
  to the pictorial references pertaining to this period would be great too.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for the suggestions...\r\n\r\nAnna"

    be more central to the style you might look at Meridien, which got a much-improved

  body: "Thanks for these ideas.\r\n\r\nI think something originating in the 15th-century
    would be best. Or the ones that were in standard use at that time because of course
    references to the Antique times were often made at then to improve status and
    the Antique objects (e.g., columns and capitals were routinely pilfered for new
    buildings). I am especially interested in the cases where precursors of a font
    are known and/or have been discussed. E.g. like in the case of Bembo (which I
    suspect would not be so good for the multimedia side of things).\r\n\r\nCadmus
    and Sophia refer a little too much to the Classic Greek lettering with Sophia
    openly acknowledging its 6th-century Greek origins (which is indeed too far from
    target). Basalt is quite nice even though it is a \u201Cfantasy\u201D font according
    to Stone himself. Maybe I can consider it given my on-screen needs, he certainly
    thought it would be ubiquitous if the Antique Rome used computers. This also gives
    me an idea that maybe I could use chiseled lettering for the major headings, calligraphic
    lettering for media inscriptions and a printed type for the texts\u2026 Or it
    might end up being too much.\r\n\r\nVendome is pretty nice, I have not seen it
    before...\r\n\r\nParadigm is also nice and is the right period especially given
    that Sweynheym and Pannartz are said to be the first printers in Rome.\r\n\r\nLots
    to think about\u2026"

  body: "This might sound strange coming from a font freak, but I think you're being
    too historically literal if you insist on the design originating from a specific
    time period. Unless the work is specifically for the highly typographically aware,
    the historical accuracy you gain will probably result in a bigger loss: functionality.
    I think it would be a pedantic limitation of your choices more than an instance
    of design sensitivity. This is especially valid due to your screen quality needs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Very true but this is also a comparative art history project where the visual
    impression of everything contributes to the argument. So, mixing in some relevant
    fonts, perhaps only in some places, would make sense.

    support the image is going to result in a boring looking book and most people
    aren\u2019t going to get the reference anyway. I could see them working on the
    cover, on the title page and in chapter openers, but doing the whole book that
    way will likely produce a pretty stuffy book."

  body: OK, thank you for the advice. I'll think about it. It is not a book. It is
    a multimedia piece with some printed matter supporting it. So, there are many
    opportunities for display types to be graphically significant and to unify the
    other visual content that is quite eclectic. I know it is impossible to explain
    well without showing more or less ready images. But the suggestions so far were
    very helplful.

    But the type \"of the time\" was used to put ink on paper. Laid paper. Wetted

    don't believe the 15th century Romans had what we term \"multimedia.\" There goes
    the possibility of literal representation. See above for the use of type of that
    period. *Lettering* would be a different matter."
