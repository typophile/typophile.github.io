  but the spacing gives me headache...\r\nThe italic is based on my upright sans,
  which I slanted 7 degrees, with the axis at the center of each letter.\r\nAnd then
  started tweaking it some, mostly the curves and joins. Now the spacing doesn\xB4t
  look too good.\r\nDoes anyone have a good practise which makes spacing easy(ier)
  in this case? That works pretty good generally? \r\nLike moving all characters a
  bit to the left and then add a bit to the sidebearings, or something. Would really
  appriciate it!"
