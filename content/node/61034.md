    of your choosing and pick the one you like the best. It really is as simple as
    that. \r\n\r\nWhy do people even post these \"what goes with what\" threads? Make

    are the height of laziness and ultimately a cop out (I thought I'd use a 60s term
    given its the 40th anniversary of Woodstock).\r\n\r\nJust because the internet
    makes it easy to ask the question, does not make it reasonable to answer the question.
    The whole point of being a typographer is to develop your own sense of style.
    Your own sense of \"what goes with what\". It may take a bit of hard work, and
    it may take some time, but ultimately it is a personal decision, and no amount
    of internet inquiry is going to give you a real leg up. Hence my response. And
    ultimately, who give a crap about pen construction or any other theory anyway.

  body: "The main problem with these questions isn't that they're lazy; more often
    than not, they're also completely missing the point. Font choices aren't variables
    to be solved on their own, easily isolated from the total equation that is good
    design (partly because the latter is actually more than the sum of its parts).\r\nI'm
    sure there are about ten thousand sans serifs that could be paired with Trajan,
    and without talking about (a) what that font in question needs to be able to do,
    exactly, nor (b) what it should communicate and (c) how and (d) two whom, and
    (e) if it needs to harmonize or contrast with the existing font, to create a hint
    of tension and be a little bitchy or to sing with it and be beautiful, \u2013
    and of course (f) what the overall concept & other known factors/constituents
    of the design in question are, \u2013 without all that discussion, it doesn't
    make all that much sense to look for / suggest fonts that, on the surface, share
    \u2013 what? <em>pen construction?</em> :-\\\r\n\r\nThe beauty of typography and
    design is the search for the right combination of the right ingredients for all
    of it to click together. And pen construction isn't gonna be The Easy Formula
    That Provides A Clickin' Experience Every Time. Nor is anything else for that
    matter. \r\nStop trying to do what you think is the correct way to do it, and
    start playing."

  body: "I do give a crap about pen constructions (and other theories) since they
    influences the feel/atmosphere of a typeface to a large extent. \r\nThat does
    not mean, that one always has to combine faces with the same construction (the
    safe way), but that they can guide you to lead the tone of your whole thing into
    various themes (the playful way). e.f. combine it with a Humanist Sans (constr.#1)
    with traditionally proportioned caps for a harmonious (maybe yet boring) feel,
    or a Grotesque face like Akzidenz Grotesk (constr.#2) for a more unusual, severe,
    stiff, contemporary atmosphere, or a Geometric (constr.#3) like Futura for a more
    modern (but also unsurprising) look. Of course you are free to try everything
    in between and beyond. \r\n\r\nFurthermore by suggesting directions or groups
    rather than concrete typefaces, you have a much bigger learning effect and need
    to figure out your own way in selecting typefaces \u2013 to \"develop your own
    sense of style. Your own sense of \u2018what goes with what\u2019\"."

    by Roman Carved Lettering itself) makes me realise that Paul RENNER's Futura -
    in a real thin weight has a similar structure to that of Roman (Trajan) lettering.
    The lowercase to uppercase relationship could be considered more of a classical
    proportion then Optima. Optima's cap height and x-height are relatively close
    together. The caps for Linea are interesting (like the B) but didn't see the lowercase
    on the reffered page. Stuff to think about. \r\n\r\nIf it hasn't been mentioned
    before \u2013 be aware that letterspacing between all capitals and letterspacing
    between lowercase in sentences are different. This is something that can be easily
    overlooked when doing a typographic design."

    has a relationship with the E and F which it seems to have its closest relationship
    to.\r\n\r\nThis example shows the capitals. Because we are considering a sans

    and the sans serif for the body text, prelims etc.\r\n\r\n@Andreas. As you know,
    Roman letters are very geometric as well as Futura. Roman letters are suggestive
    of or made up of Circles, Squares and Triangles. However Futura is not as geometric
    as originally thought the more you look at it in detail. That is why there is
    a nice balance between the two - they sort of meet half way."
