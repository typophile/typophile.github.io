  this can be changed) and it made me wonder why they''ve programmed it that way. '

    lack of typographical knowledge might be one. A situation faced by 90% (I expect)
    of Word users.\r\n\r\nSeriously, programming code with fixed width characters
    is the only no-kerning application I can think of, and I suspect that fixed width
    characters are designed with no kerning table anyway."

  body: Probably a decision made in the distant past (for performance reasons maybe),
    and not changed due to document reflow issues (think Bush memos). Surprised Word
    didn't turn it on be default when they switched from Times New Roman to Calibri
    as PowerPoint did.

  body: ">not changed due to document reflow issues \r\n\r\nAt Typecon I talked to
    a guy from Microsoft who works on Publisher and he said that was the reason. I
    \ argued that if it is on by default you can still turn it off if you want the
    old flow. He said more or less that Microsoft customers are too clueless to do
    this, even if there is a notice when the change is made.  And I said: by that
    reasoning you'll never change to what you acknowledge is a better way. And he
    replied \"go to hell.\" Ok, he didn't actually say that, but that was the message
    I got. "

    capture the flavour of unkerned shareware fonts.\r\n\r\nOr if you have a connected
    script font in InD, set to \"optical kerning\".\r\nActually, there's no way to
    \"de-kern\" a font in InDesign. \r\nBut you can do it in Quark, I believe, by
    using the kern edit table."
