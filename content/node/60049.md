body: "Perhaps some esteemed person here can help me. \r\n\r\nI was told the other
  night by an art handler (met him through a friend) that Alberto Giacometti spent
  some of his professional time lettering doors and windows to earn a living. He claims
  he read this in a book that's now out of print and of course he no longer remembers
  the title or author. \r\n\r\nMy initial online search yielded letters from his bookplates
  and prints. There seems to be a typeface inspired by these whimsical letters by
  Linotype. Interesting, but that is not what I am searching for. \r\n\r\nAre there
  any documents of his more rigorous/professional lettering?"
