  used Identifont (http://www.identifont.com/) and WhatTheFont (http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/)
  to try to figure it out myself, but I found no match.\r\n\r\nAre there many proprietary,
  or custom, typefaces in the grave marker industry?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for
  your help.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Off the top of my head, I'd guess something like Sabon (bold or semi), slightly
    condensed.

  body: Tim, you have to realise that alphabets for engraving and such are specifically
    produced for that medium and the technology used to produce this type of lettering.
    It is highly unlikely you will find an equivalent as a computer font.

  body: I understand. Thank you Yves, and thanks for the guess Chuck. I'll look into
    Sabon as a close match.
