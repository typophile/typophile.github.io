  connected to kerning a font in FontLab meant to be exported in OT format (but at
  least a basic set of instructions to work for T1 export would do just fine for now)\r\n\r\nthe
  typeface in question has only uppercases and is based on the basic shapes of Times
  New Roman, being intended as a modern refreshment and a replacement for the latter
  in an identity programme.\r\n\r\nI have heard discussions on a (not so liked by
  many of you out there) practice consisting of using font metrics data from a well
  kerned typeface. \r\n\r\nAny help is greatly apreciated."
