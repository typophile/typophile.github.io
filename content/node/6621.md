    perfume and wohlgeruch is not the same. Right? <BR>And PLEASURE is about the pleasure
    to know new places and travelling. What is the best word for that? <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: The only other suggestion I might make &#40;and obviously I don&#39;t know
    what you&#39;re planning to do with those words&#41; is to try to make them all
    the same tense. Most of them are verbs - maybe find a verb that works for Pleasure
    or Scent &#40;you already have smell&#41;. You could use a word like Enjoy or
    Savor or Relax for Pleasure.

    as is. I think Savor works better for Scent than Enjoy. <BR> <BR>Some others:
    Indulge, Relish.'

    yourself a treat. <BR> <BR>Yes, I&#39;ve done some restaurant/cafe work but mostly
    I design books. <BR> <BR>thanks.
