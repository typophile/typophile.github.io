body: "I got two cabinets full with types from Schriftguss A.-G.\r\nWonderful fonts
  like Supremo, Butterfly, Sper-Reflex.\r\nI know the year of first production (Erstguss)
  and I already checked the names of the fonts. But I cannot find informations about
  the designers of these fonts.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have some information?\r\nWithout
  it, I cannot print the full character set...\r\nBut if you can help, I promise scans
  within some weeks.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, the book shows 'Schriftguss' as the foundry source. There are some other
    typefaces shown from this foundry, such as scripts called 'Pentape' (or Originell),
    'Marggraff Light Italic', 'Energos', 'Burgund', and 'Aktuell' (or Penflow). 'Butterfly'
    was also a script. I haven't looked at the other categories, except to find 'Supremo'
    & 'Super-Reflex', which are Lineales.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
