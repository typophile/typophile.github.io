  and isolated version, including the stylized \"A\" characters:\r\n<img src=\"http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f71/sluggxp/gs1_zps2044e022.png\"
  />\r\n\r\nAnd without the \"A\":\r\n<img src=\"http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f71/sluggxp/gs2_zps2b57ba80.png\"
  />\r\n\r\n\r\nI just need a font that fits well, but it does not have to be exact.
  Any font that fits well with the stylized \"A\" would be fantastic!\r\n\r\nI thank
  you very much in advance."

    free font by Dieter Steffmann is a close match.\r\nThe /A is probably custom"
