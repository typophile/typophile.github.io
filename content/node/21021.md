  on the flourishes that I've made on the Uppecase A and C.\r\n\r\nThey were based
  on the flourishes in the typeface 'Odile' by village, but fused with the Caslon
  (two twenty four) style.\r\n\r\nI've never attempted a heavy-edit like this so would
  be good to know if there's anything wrong with it!\r\n\r\nSee what you think,\r\nEd\r\n"

  body: "Hi there Ed, \r\n\r\nI really like the serif part of the logo, I know you
    asked if we could comment on the flourishes but I just wanted to say a quick thing
    about the Associates part of it. \r\n\r\nUsing Helvetica thin makes the word almost
    dissappear, it feels very dominated by the seriffed word. It might be an idea
    to go up a weight. Just a visual thought thats all. \r\n\r\nAs for the flourishes,
    I think they are working really well, I have just designed a logo for a swiss
    bank based around a 16th century script font and the one thing i couldnt put my
    finger on at the time was that I have not made the flourishes big enough. \r\n\r\nI
    realised that I should have been a lot bolder with them and really excentuate
    them. I think the C is working really nicely, but I think the A could do with
    a little more. Its the start of the logo and might be a nice way to lead in. \r\n\r\n"

    body: "Thanks Matt,\r\n\r\nI think I like the way that the associates is dominated
      - it very much emphasises the Abigail Carney part (which is good as it is a
      very personal business at the moment). I'll try 45 light though maybe!\r\n\r\nI
      agree I think the A needs something else \u2013 seen any nice A's around?\r\nEd\r\n"

    it compliments the rest of the logo, I jus think it needs extending a little,
    made larger. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sorry of course, here are a couple, i like Byron a lot due to the flourish
    actually being seperate from the main letter. They arnt brilliant examples but
    might show how the flourish is a little excentuated. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/byron-rr/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gideon/beau-rivage/one/\r\n\r\nThis
    one I have just thrown in as I love it, really nice embeleshing typeface. Probably
    a bit over the top for what you need but beautiful all the same. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/ayres-royal/\r\n\r\nWhen
    I designed a script logo, i basically traced a simple flourish from another typeface
    and then just stretched it a little here and there. I am no type designer so it
    was the easiest way really. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think you can afford to be more extravagant with the flourish on the C
    and extend it to the right past the serif to balance the letter. I looked at the
    decorative initials of Odile, I find them a bit cramped which is understandable
    since it might have to function with lines of copy above and below, for a logotype
    with an exclusion area you don't have the same problem. Extending the C's flourish
    will also help it to balance with the cap height of Associates. I would approach
    the A from a different direction either by extending the lefthand vertical downward
    and inserting a scroll (you could try curving it up to form the crossbar). The
    other approach I would look at is a horizontal flourish from the top going left
    and curving down.\r\n\r\nAn alternative might be to really go over the top on
    the C, leaving the A as standard, if you make the focus of the flourish lead toward
    the centre of the logo it could balance nicely. Matt's idea for using a flourish
    from another font is one way of working alternatively if you type out the logo
    with no flourish and print out several copies and work over the top with a pencil,
    scan it and draw it.\r\n\r\nI would also increase the rn kerning, stop them crashing.\r\n\r\nTim"

    body: "Great, thanks very much to both of you. \r\nSome nice ideas there and good
      advice! I agree I think the flourishes should be developed and exaggerated and
      it will make the mark even more unique - and emphasise the contrast. The idea
      has been presented and the client loves it so we'll see how things go!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ed I think that's fantastic!\r\nDespite other's views, I like the fact that
    Associates is so less dominant... the emphasis is needed on Abigail Carney.\r\n\r\nI
    see what others are saying about the A of Abigail... it could be good to make
    more of a fuss over it... say perhaps having a larger flourish coming from the
    bottom-left??\r\n\r\nOtherwise I don't what else to say, I love it myself. "
