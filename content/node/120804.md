  found an it was incompatabile with many of my fonts, no matter which word processing
  program I used: Pages 5, Pages '09, TextEdit, Nisus, or Mellel.\r\n\r\nSome fonts
  just would not work properly in it.\r\n\r\nSo on Monday I went back to using OS
  X Mavericks. \r\n\r\nI fought pretty hard to have the fonts issues solved in Pages
  5, and Tim Cook even took note of the issues I raised, but it seems the engineers
  just don't care about fonts or typography. I give up. I'll stick with Mavericks
  until the font issues have been solved, which may be never.\r\n\r\nIf you have observed
  any problems with Yosemite, please let me know. I will keep tabs on the issue."

  body: Interesting, After years of putting off moving up from OS X 10.6 I put Yosemite
    on my Mac Pro on Tuesday - no problems except the ones I knew about - lost a couple
    of useful programs - but all fonts seem to be fine in InDesign, Word, PhotoShop
    etc. Since I do not use the programs you mention I would look for updated versions
    that might correct Yosemite problems. As I said, so far so good with fonts - even
    ScanFont works OK  with the compatability pack.

    this isn\u2019t entirely accurate. It has nothing to do with whether fonts are
    \u2018homemade\u2019 or not. An units per em (upm) other than 1000 is perfectly
    valid for OpenType fonts. In fact, it can have any value between 16 and 16384.
    There are a number of fonts from FontFont and Adobe which use 2000 upm.\r\n\r\nChanging
    the upm in FontLab will scale the glyphs and lead to distortions in the outlines.
    (There was probably a good reason why the type designer needed a higher resolution
    in the first place.)\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t imagine what effect \u2018rebuilding
    the names\u2019 should have on this issue.\r\n\r\nApplication updates can\u2019t
    change this (unless applications switch to their own font rendering engine). It\u2019s
    clearly a bug in Mac OS X and will probably be fixed in the next system update."

    are communicating with Apple\u2019s type team about this. Luckily, only a very
    few FFs actually have 2000 upm, but still, it is something that we hope Apple
    addresses immediately.\r\n\r\nI upgraded about a week ago on my desktop machine
    and my macbook. So far no issues; FAP, at work, works as usual (with the upgrade
    they pushed out the same day as Yosemite rolled out); Font Explorer, at home,
    is running like a charm. Indesign and other CS/CC seem to be functioning perfectly,
    and I'm not having any issues (other than a number of embed problems with collisions
    between licensed & bundled versions of Helvetica, which is something that's been
    plaguing me for several years) in terms of type in our PDF workflow.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact, I'd say that Yosemite sped up the launch, save, print and various operations
    speeds in the Adobe apps pretty significantly. The only thing that has slowed
    down is Outlook.\r\n\r\nJLT"

    Runs very fast compared to vintage Mac hardware and it's pretty easy to get files
    in and out of it. It lets you choose a folder on your modern Mac that shows up
    as a volume in the emulator. I used it recently to make PDFs from 20-year-old
    PageMaker files (don't ask).
