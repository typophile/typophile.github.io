  is it mid-century Parisian?) aesthetic they get from the typography on the website
  for Alice Waters' restaurant, Chez Panisse:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.chezpanisse.com/reservations/]]\r\n\r\nNothing
  on WhatTheFont quite matches the quirks of this one (the 'E' and 'P,' for instance).
  What are your best guesses? And how would you describe this aesthetic? We're shooting
  for something that \"you would find on the side of a barn.\" Thank you all <em>so
  much!</em>"

    Monday</a> is a distressed face with alternate characters with \"random\" coding.\r\n\r\nYou
    should make this post in the Design forum, and enquire about faces with \"random\"
    coding in general, and distressed ones in particular. That would be an interesting
    thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    from Neutraface, which Cheap Monday feels quite similar to.\r\n\r\nI might add:
    I don't care about the font being distressed, I'm more after the letterforms/mood.
    Thanks again."

    more after a mid-century look, which is less deco, more grotesque, 19th century
    retro. However, I do think that glyph alternates is a very important part of the
    Chez Panisse aesthetic.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://christianschwartz.com/local.shtml\">Local
    Gothic</a> has that, but the effect may be a bit too obvious for your needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick, thanks for coaching me along with this. \"Less deco, more grotesque\"
    is <em>exactly</em> it! But somehow this Chez Panisse font has them both: pretty
    geometric, except the E, A, V, etc. \r\n\r\nSo I'm after a mid-century grotesque
    who has eyes for fonts twenty years its junior. Or perhaps a straightforward 19th
    century sans. What do y'all think fits the bill?"

    fonts are indeed heavily indebted to [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Nobel/styles/|Nobel]]
    (but not completely \u2013 the 'A', for instance). \r\n\r\nNick, I'm also seeing
    the wisdom of your comment that glyph alternates are a big factor (there are both
    Nobel-esque and deco V's there). The plot thickens?"

    Caf\xE9 the other day and was impressed with the menu that used proper optical
    sizes of Minion. They change often. I would not be surprised if this was a custom
    typeface.\r\n\r\nI think \"irregular industrial grotesque\" is a good way to describe
    this. It\u2019s also more European than American. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/device/coldharbour-gothic/?refby=typographica\">Coldharbour
    Gothic</a> is the closest thing I know in digital font form.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque/?refby=typographica\">Brandon
    Grotesque</a> might be what you're looking for, but probably too polished. <a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/red_rooster/tempo_medium_grunged/?affid=99346\">Tempo</a>
    is another option, but with contours based on the small sizes of metal type, probably
    doesn't cut it for headlines.\r\n\r\nHow about <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/rhode/\">Rhode</a>?

  body: "Stephen, those are fantastic and comprehensive suggestions. You're right
    that it's the combination of irregular/grotesque that I'm connecting with on the
    Chez Panisse website, which means Coldharbour feels nearly pitch perfect, but
    (on the irregular side) Toronto Gothic also suggests another direction, and Brandon
    Gothic nails the mood of the letterforms. I think I'll mock up all three \u2013
    thanks and bravo.\r\n\r\nI agree with you about the instinct that this is a custom
    font. It's no surprise, I guess - Alice Waters is very particular about everything
    at her restaurants. I love the idea that her tastes are so highly developed that
    not only does the food have to be top-notch, but she needs properly-set Myriad,
    or at least can discern the designers who are going to be able deliver it for
    her. There's something about aesthetics and auteurs there that I love. I got to
    eat at the Caf\xE9 a few years ago, but was too fixated on my nettle souffle to
    notice the typography (for once!).\r\n\r\nThanks again to everyone. I hope I can
    be as useful to you all one of these days!"
