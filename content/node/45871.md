  body: Hmm... so you're saying I should have 3 functional funnels and 1 to represent
    the 'non-functional' one. Do you think I should have 4 portholes with body copy?
    Does it look funny with just 3 portholes and 4 funnels? Am I going against the
    rules of design in some way?

  body: "Do you really think so? I feel like a bad designer the way my fellow class
    mates crit me on my work. I felt sooooooo bad, sooooo bad a designer, I felt sick
    to the pit of my stomach. I cried myself to sleep thinking I was the worse design
    student ever. I have a few more to go which I will post on here as I go along.
    I hope they work just as well. Please identify problems with my kerning, tracking,
    leading etc. All feedback welcome. My initial concept is a book that opens up
    into an A1 sheet, 1 paper to tie in with the 'first/1' theme and 1 colour, it
    being pantone No 1 but that colour seems so dull and uninteresting. I have thought
    of printing with gold ink onto a coloured paper like deep purple to represent
    'quality', 'the best' as in royalty but not royalty literally. Good idea or bad?
    I know it will take away the concept of 'pantone No 1' but then I could say '1
    colour only' instead. I know silver on light grey looks sophisticated and stylish
    but silver doesn't represent No1 or FIRST beacuse you would get a gold medal for
    coming first in a race, for instance. Yaay or naaay?\r\n\r\nPS Michael: It's okay.

    the work above, I know the kerning, tracking etc needs sorting on the rocket image.
    I have thought of using type for the fins but it doesn't read right 'so some said'.
    Hmm...I'll keep posting my work on here as I go along. \r\n\r\nPS Tiffany, I shall
    try a pointier 1 but do you not think I should have the same typeface all the

  body: "missgiggles, I think your solutions are very good.\r\nIn this resolution
    the kerning and tracking in the rocket works as it is to me. You might want to
    widen the words that end with L, P and R a little, to fill the gaps in the right
    side of the rocket. I also think it might be valuable to look at the leading and
    make sure it is (optically) consistent.\r\n\r\nMixing typefaces can be tricky!
    In designs like this it might be best to stick to one family. I second Tiffany's
    suggestions about trying to draw the whole thing by hand, and/or finding a 1 that
    is more pointed (I'm thinking [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/|Eagle]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/futura-black/|Futura Black]]). You might
    get away with just changing the font of the 1, if it is close enough in style
    to the other font you use.\r\n\r\nYou could also try tilting the rocket just a
    little, to make the design more alive.\r\n\r\nAs regards the ship, it might benefit
    from some tracking and kerning. The word spacing could be decreased somewhat,
    especially between THE and UN. As an alternative to the Bodoni, you could try
    using a 1910's art-deco font, such as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bernhard-boldcond/|Bernhard]].\r\n\r\nAs
    aluminum so wisely wrote: take the critique that you think is valuable, and ignore
    the rest. :)"

  body: Conceptually the second one is more elegant because it does everything it
    needs to just with the type. Very Nice. I wonder if you might loose the swirls
    at the base of the rocket and replace them with bigger & smaller letter "d"s  or
    periods. Hmmm probably periods. I do like the idea of a tilt. Also you could chop
    off the arm of the one to make the rocket a simpler more rocket-like shape. Be
    proud of your good work. :-)

    On the actual ship they had a black band at the top, and were a yellow colour.
    You could try having just the top letters in black and the remainder in the yellow?

  body: I think Chris is right, the titanic one fits well. Nice choice of typeface.
    It kinda reminds me of <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/05/the_poseidon_adventure_1972.jpg">this</a>.
    Are they supposed to work in series? If so, you may want to think about the color
    choice between the two. On the first, I would tend to agree with Miss tiffany,
    the contrails don't seem to match the typeface. Have you tried maybe making the
    text the actual <a href="http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/StarChild/space_level2/apollo11_lem_big.gif">lunar

    G: I need to sort my portholes out. I am thinking of photographic portholes rather
    than illustrations. The thing with using colour is that my book is meant to be
    one colour only (goldish colour to celebrate excellence)  and due to that, I have
    to try and work ways round it as colour plays an important role when trying to
    convey a message. Otherwise, teh idea of using yellow at the top would have been
    great.\r\n\r\nChipman: I used the top of an 'O' for my rocket to sit on but it
    made it look too complex, thus lacked simplicity. I am still experimenting with
    my layouts as there's definitely more work to be done to bring it up to perfection.
    I will try what Eben has suggested but I don't know what 'periods' are. Can someone
    please explain.\r\n\r\nPS Would someone be able to tell me more about the Onyx
    typeface (titanic poster). I know it was created in 1937 by Gerry Powell but what
    characteristics does it portray? Is it from the modernist era (by the way...I

  body: "Hello Miss,\r\nI like the idea of the Titanic poster, the text illustration
    works well, the rest is not so strong. The body copy  doesn't compliment the the
    text illustration. How about a slightly celtic influence style to the body copy
    seeing as the Titanic was built in Belfast, or even referencing the typography
    of time (which included some amazing hand drawn work). The gold theme you suggest
    really doesn't add up for me, and the whole layout seems a little cramped, if
    it's going to b a poster you need to allow more space all around for the mounting.
    purple and foil block ( as that the nly real way of getting gold on a poster)
    again doest fit with the theme, I'd look closer at posters of the time and their
    colour schemes then update your selection.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until you explained
    what your Maggie Thatcher poster was about until I got it, and I am pretty into
    my politics. \r\nThe poster doesn't in anyway remind me of Maggie, it's far too
    subtle (she wasn't anything like subtle). If a poster requires an explanation
    then it's really failed in it's job. I think  a poster more influenced by it's
    era, (the 80's) or even influenced by the highly successful Saatchi & Saatchi
    campaign would be a more appropriate avenue to explore.  \r\n\r\nLooking forward
