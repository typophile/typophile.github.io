body: "I was wondering if anybody had any good suggestions for a paper stock that
  would imply paper money. Before anyone goes reporting me to the Secret Service,
  I am going to be designing a birth announcemnt. One of the inserts will look like
  money but well within the legal guidelines to keep me from being investigated for
  counterfeiting. I called the local Secret Service office to obtain the guidelines.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I started looking at the selection from Crane's but was wondering if there was anything
  else.\r\n\r\nAs always, I sincerely thank you for any and all assistance you may
  provide."

    made with bits of old money. '
