body: "New to this forum and generally a neophyte when it comes to typeface. (I understand
  and agree with the general rule against Comic Sans; I also cringe at the commercial
  use of Tempus Sans and Papyrus.) I'm looking for advice for a tattoo I'm planning
  on getting. It's a quotation from Dickens' \"Great Expectations.\" I'm trying to
  decide whether to use a typeface similar to whatever was in use at the time of the
  book's publication in serial form, or go in another direction.\r\n\r\nThe full quote:
  \"We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to go back,
  and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and the world lay spread
  before me.\" I'll probably only use the last bit, \"and the world lay spread before
  me\".\r\n\r\nAny thoughts (keeping in mind, of course, that this will be tattooed
  on my body)?"

  body: "I think it's important to determine which body part it will end up on. Concerning
    which, I have an idea: instead of laying down only the last few words, find a
    body part that can show those last words to good effect, but can somehow \"open
    up\" to reveal the complete quote, for those interested.\r\n\r\nAnd about historical
    accuracy: it depends how important it is to secretly satisfy yourself with such
    \"inside information\", because virtually nobody will be able to make the connection.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    he found 1 (one) guy that he liked. That guy was in Australia. So, yeah, it is
    a reasonable advice, but only in theory."
