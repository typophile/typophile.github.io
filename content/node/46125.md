  on picas, is used for the grid. I''m looking for a face used for scientific annotations,
  which is pre-metric, and English. I''d appreciate any suggestions? Thanks! '

  body: 'I meant before standardised A sizes. Sorry I didn''t make that clear. DIN,
    for example, is the polar opposite of what I''m looking for. Caslon, being English
    (the calender only relates to England), predating 20th century modernism and having
    surely been used for many science texts is probably appropriate enough, but its
    really not very inspired. I was hoping someone might have a brilliant insight.   '
