  body: Closest I can come is Engraver's/Sackers Gothic but it's not a match. What's
    the source?

  body: It's from an old machinery nameplate. I'd place it in the late 30's, early
    40's.

    pedigree, is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_bau_lf_medium/">FF

  body: "These nameplates were often cast, which obviously requires a mold. The mold
    would probably have been built by gluing a mockup using three dimensional letters
    cut on a pantograph machines (which produces beveled edges, necessary for use
    in molds), in either plexiglas or brass, depending on when it was produced. The
    patterns used as masters in pantograph cutting were often handcut (with scrollsaw/jigsaw)
    from wood, brass or plexiglas, based on printed samples. \r\n\r\nSo you may not
    find an exact match for this, because printing used to make the masters could
    have been rough woodcuts, or an old block printing font that was never digitized,
    and because of the oddities that would be introduced by the skill )or lack of
    skill) of the person cutting the samples templates.\r\n\r\nLong way of saying,
    Sacker's Gothic may be as close as you can come.\r\n\r\nJason C\r\n\r\n[edited
    for spelling errors, which put Stephen's reply in front of my post!]"

  body: "This plate is actually debossed, or stamped. The back of the aluminum is
    flat while the letters are slightly (and I mean barely) raised. It almost seems
    to be a combination of a few Gothic fonts. Note the short center leg on the \"E\",
    all ends are squared, the lower leg on the \"K\" connects at almost the mid of
    the upper, the ends of the \"S\" extend fully to the extent of the rounds, and
    the uprights of the \"A\" are symetrical.\r\n\r\nI'm growing weary of tracing
    all these letters and was hoping for a lucky reprieve. I guess not.\r\n\r\nThanks
    all."
