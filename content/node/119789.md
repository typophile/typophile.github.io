  dresses up as a font. It's pretty open -- it doesn't have to include the font itself,
  just represent it in some way. So a gothic script might put on a lot of eyeliner
  and dress like they listen to the Cure a lot, or Comic Sans could dress as a character
  from a comic strip.\r\n\r\nI just thought it was a clever idea and wanted to pass
  it along here. Happy autumn!"
