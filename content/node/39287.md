  ugly, whatever. I wanted to do something which wold challenge me more than the norm,
  and I had the idea of separating text and image in an architectural magazine. This
  would allow articles to perhaps become bigger, without taking any importance away
  from the images which are separated. \r\n\r\nArchitecture, with art follows movements
  and styles, from Bauhaus to Deconstructivism, as does typography. So reflecting
  the nature of the article and thus images in the typographical layout for each spread,
  but then we have no images - so more white space to contend with. And then - maybe
  - the lack of continuity throughout. \r\n\r\nThis is a brief from two tutors, one
  of which I speak to alot, and he's happy for me to be as experimental as i want
  as he believes i will learn more. \r\n\r\nI just wanted to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nI
  understand there could be alot of problems, and I think i maybe 'screwing' myself
  over by doing this as the following is bothering me even though ive yet to start;\r\n\r\ntoo
  much white space\r\nnot enough continuity\r\n\r\n\r\nTrying to figure out how I
  could navigate to and from these separations is interesting me - i also thought
  of using thumbnails  or maybe just a portion of the image in each layout. \r\n\r\nattempt,
  or stay away?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hi. By all means sit down and do some thumbnail sketches... it will help you
    a lot to see your idea on paper rather than in your head. And if you feel like
    posting images here, go right ahead. I think you'll get better feedback that way.

  body: It sounds to me like you want to make an architectural magazine that operates
    more like a fashion magazine. Not a bad idea at all.
