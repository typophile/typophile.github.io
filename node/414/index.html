		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, would you make it a vertical leg then? I kind of like the diagonal leg. It gives the font a little rythem.  <BR>The clotting parts will be corrected soon. Also there will be a lighter weight, this version will be the startingpoint. But first the kapitals. <BR>I tried skewing it in Fontographer and that looks great.

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm, I think I used the opposite word! In a Roman (upright) font a shear is when the ending of a stroke (like a vertical stem) is not flat, it's at an angle (usually &quot;uphill&quot;). <BR> <BR>In an italic, a flat ending is already at an angle to the stem! But I was thinking leaving it like that makes the italic &quot;boring&quot;, so maybe you can try making the ending either perpendicular to the stroke (which would make the letters look like they're falling forward), or try making the endings <i>more</i> sheared (uphill), which would make the letters look&hellip; sharper? Not sure. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi David, <BR> <BR>I realised I was always busy with fonts, from an early time. Somehow I seem to have forgotten that. But not really, because one day I started again. Out of nothing.  <BR> <BR>I have propably no interesting story behind this font. I just started on an idea in my sketchbook and very quickly started to build the glyphs in Freehand. I had an idea of the overall look and feel of the font. I wanted a monoline, so no thick-thin proportions. I wanted a font that is very open and, when typed in longer texts, it will start to look like a wallpaper. <BR>I'm not looking for selling the font. It was mainly my early contact with font creating. I would like to do that in order to create fonts for myself to use in my work. <BR> <BR>Because the font is mainly based on a square with rounded edges, it was very easy to create the basic of the font. So I had no specific order in which to work.  <BR>That is maybe also part of the problem. I wish I knew how to handle a fontcreation like that. I'm a graphic designer and know about typography, but not (enough) about font creation. Is there an order in which to work or to handle a project like this? <BR> <BR>I rebuild the font because, in my FOG, there was no room for the kapitals, etc, etc, etc. Perhaps thats also the fact that I can't seem to finish it. I did so much for it that maybe I'm over the point. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have some info on how to deal with font creation? Guidelines, background info, etc. I know it is a profession for itself, but it has to be possible to do it semi-professionally. <BR> <BR>Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Phillip, <BR> <BR>Thanx again for your opinion. Like I said I also had some problems with those characters. The first 'x' is not bad, though it would have to be wider. I wanted to optically correct it a bit, but keep the vertical idea. But this little diagonal touch is great. The second one is not it, for me.  <BR>The '2' is a good suggestion. I will try to make the lower horizontal line a little longer. It is just a little to heavy at the top. But other than that it's better than before. <BR> <BR>Concerning the caps, yes I will make them bigger than the x-height. I wanted to take the top hight of the font and make them all as 'squared' as the lowercases. <BR> <BR>The 'r' I will leave like that. I will adjust the cluttering a little, but I kind of like that diagonal there. <BR> <BR>Ren</div>
