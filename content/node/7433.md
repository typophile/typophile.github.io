body: I am designing a logo for a trucking company. They like the simplistic approach
  of making the trailor out of a &#34;c&#34;. I would appreciate suggestions to the
  icon or type.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52470.gif"

  body: your personal logo would have worked pretty well here <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Maybe the type to mark ratio should be rethought,
    maybe try italicising &#39;TRUCKING&#39; and tighten up the kerning, the negative
    space between tha lettering is not consistent with any other part of the design,
    in my opinion. If this is going to be a fleet graphic, then it will have a different
    look and feel untill you actually see it that large, so I guess it&#39;s hard
    to say. <BR> <BR>I think the colours work well, they are good and consistent with
    that industry, ie. road signage, warehouse signage etc... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not
    sure, if, at another level, the &#39;cutout&#39; in the truck is sending a positive
    message <BR> <BR>Those are just some of my initial thoughts, I hope  they didn&#39;t
    come across too negative

  body: the truck, sans drop shadow looks much better and the smaller cutout/counter
    looks great as well, I hacked together a couple of other layouts you might want
    explore but yours looks good as is. For the spacing between the letters in  TRUCKING,
    I&#39;m guessing you chose to go with the stroke width in CALHOUN. You can also
    try to align the truck and &#39;trucking&#39;, as in, make them the same width
    and cut on the same angled guide. Orange looks great, nice <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52500.gif"

  body: Tom did you investigate making Calhoun the truck body&#40;the whole word&#41;?
    Look how much it represents the shape. See if you didn&#39;t tell me the body
    of the truck was a C I wouldn&#39;t initially get it.

  body: Hi Tom, <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t what kind of trucks they use &#40;smaller regional/delilvery
    trucks?&#41; The snub nosed cab is just not as tough looking as a long-nosed rig.
    <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;d set this idea aside. The C doesn&#39;t read as a C. What
    else have you got?

  body: I like Daniel&#39;s idea of having the whole &#34;CALHOUN&#34; title create
    the trailer, although, I would bet the bag that it&#39;s been done by others.
    Try it and see how it looks. If it was reproduced as such on the actual trailer
    applications it would be pretty strong. <BR> <BR>Have you attempted to do any
    humanistic stylized approaches &#40;hand drawn&#41;? I think the C-trailer might
    still work if you draw it imperfectly and make sure the C is legible. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: i like the truck icon, however, as said, the hole in the truck could represent
    something negative.  the style seems to flow nicely with the truck industry, and
    i think you should stay somewhere in that region.  if you stray to far design-wise,
    people won&#39;t like it and will not associate it with trucking. <BR> <BR>i think
    the rigid truck icon is a good direction--a hand-drawn approach would not be strong
    enough. <BR> <BR>the gaps in the first few letters of CALHOUN bother me... i mean,
    i wish there were gaps in the last 4 letters as well.  it&#39;s so tight around
    the HOUN.  also, i think the letters should be altered to have a more unique quality.  and
    i would try them non-oblique.

  body: I guess the &#34;hand-drawn&#34; approach I was suggesting is meant to be
    in a NASCAR direction. Strength and speed could successfully be communicated,
    but probably not &#34;rigid&#34;

  body: Thanks everyone for their advice. I should have said more about what I am
    going for. The big thing with this logo was I wanted the icon to be strong, reliable,
    but fast. I realize the icon was rigid, so I have made modifications. I think
    it is greatly improved! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52598.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>Something bothered me about the icon before I posted it
    Sunday. I didn&#39;t have the same confident feeling I normaly do about my logos,
    but I have to stay with the general idea of the c in the truck. When I initially
    sat down with the client I started sketching and playing while I waited for him
    to arrive. He saw the sketches and just loved the idea.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52599.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Randy- they are large trucks. I also should have stated that
    in the beginning. On this icon I didn&#39;t want to get too specific on the truck
    since I don&#39;t want the logo to get too outdated. I didn&#39;t even want to
    use a truck in the beginning, but the client wanted that. My original idea was
    to use a bull as the icon. I don&#39;t like directly using the subject in the
    logo &#40;usually&#41;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52600.jpg"

    <BR> <BR>Scott- I have tried to make it less rigid. Also, I presented them with
    more illustrative, softer sketches. He and his wife were more interested in the
    bulkier sharper idea. Below is one of the sketches I showed him. <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52602.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR>I
    would love to have further criticism on my new version. Let me know if the negative
    space is still a problem. The space in the middle still bothers me, but not as
    much. I agree that it could be negative, but does the new logo help that?

    looks like a T in the middle. I have now come full circle. I think I am subconsciously
    drifting towards my own logo. Let me know if this works. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52607.gif"

  body: I think the mark is coming along, but you might want to revisit Raja&#39;s
    comments about scale and proportion. I think the mark and the C in Calhoun start
    to fight as they get closer in height. <BR> <BR>And is it just me, or are the
    type and mark obliqued at slightly different angles?

  body: the curved corners on the C don&#39;t work as well for the truck as it did
    before when it had hard corners, i think.  also, the truck proportion is now more
    like a rental truck, where as before it was a huge mack truck. <BR> <BR>having
    a picture of a truck on the side of a truck could be really redundant.  take dominik&#39;s
    advice and revisit the bull.

    and don&#39;t really mind that the &#39;c&#39; isn&#39;t terribly obvious.

  body: 'I must agree with darrel. I don&#39;t think immediacy of reading a &#34;C&#34;
    is very significant. <BR> <BR>What I find so powerful in the second version of
    the mark &#40;the first orange version&#41; is the fundamental meaning of trucking
    company you have managed to capture so simply and powerfully. The line leading
    to the inner counter space suggests the idea or path of loading things into the
    truck, and then the space inside--while roomy enough--is secured by solid walls.
    Very much like the dynamics the Chase logo is playing with. Inviting but also
    secure.  <BR> <BR>Then you create this powerful sense of motion allowing a line
    of space to cut through the truck, emphasizing the urgency/importance of delivering
    with speed. You really nailed the essence of trucking: security &#43; speed. It&#39;s
    stunning really. <BR> <BR>The newer versions of the truck not only loses the sense
    of security within the hold, but the horizontal rush dissolves with the upward
    curve of the line. <BR> <BR>I would try going back to the first orange C truck
    and replacing the wheel line with the word &#34;Calhoun.&#34; You will retain
    the horizontal line in the space between the mark and the letterforms, and it
    could ultimately resolve the relation between the mark and the logotype.  This
    also reduces the elements you are asking people to interact with. <BR> <BR>I understand
    shying away from the subject as logo, and I acknowledge the worry of truck image
    on truck redundancy, but I think your symbol moves far enough from the world of
    illustration to not feel awkward &#40;especially without wheels&#41;.'

  body: Your perspective truck sketch looks much nicer than the vector versions. I
    don&#39;t think that making the C so obvious is the best way to go. In your sketch
    it is less obvious and this looks better in my opinion. I think that in general
    people like to discover hidden meaning, and in the case of the C shaped container
    on the truck it would also look better visually if it was shown like the sketch.  <BR>
    <BR> Type style you choose works well for subject matter.
