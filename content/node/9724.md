  body: Nice Miguel, it conveys a very rustical and spontaneous feeling. <BR> <BR>The
    lines in the base of the M, a, n and k that are too straight, make them rough.
    <BR>Uppercase M is too light.  <BR>I prefer the double storey lower case a. <BR>
    <BR>This logo would benfit of some kind of musical or folk reference with a hand
    made sense such as chaquira, hand painting, hand engraving or something like that.

  body: Nicely done indeed, Miguel. I just think the tilde is a bit too heavy. <BR>And,
    I have not listened to the band&#39;s music &#40;obviously!&#41;, so I wonder
    if the logo isn&#39;t too &#34;cute&#34; for a folk-prog band?

  body: Hi and thanks to all, <BR> <BR>I will do now some new alternatives with some
    of your suggestions. About the sound of the music, the compositor and leader of
    the band show me 3 songs of the first EP album demos. The rock sound is defined
    as FAT, as a difference with other andean rock bands, because of the riffs and
    the melodic solos are from an andean flute called Quena, who is sweeter than electric
    guitar . BTW, i try to do a more close &#34;vernacular&#34; or warm feeling in
    the proportion of the letters because of the flutes.., that
