  be awesome, for some reason this font isn't working on my version of Indesign and
  I need to create a 36 page program with this or something very similar as the headline
  font! We already have mailers/invites/ads out using Manzo. Thanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FNT013_P_4576.GIF]"
