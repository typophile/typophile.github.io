  drawn from a lettraset typeface called 'Madelaine'. I've had a look about but couldn't
  find any further reference of or a digitised version.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if
  a digitised version of Madelaine is available?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDom "

  body: "The source was from Grafik magazine and the logo was designed by Neil at
    Design n/a. He was good enough to tell me he drew th V from a letraset font he
    had called Madelaine. The rest of the type is set in Carousel.\r\n\r\nOctopuss
    is pretty similar so maybe that is the closest thing that is digitised.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDom"

    It is an improvement from Octopuss, and I wasn't aware the Donnas are using it
    as their logo.\r\n\r\nDom"
