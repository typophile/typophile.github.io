  so that I could use them on my Windows XP laptop.\r\n\r\nBut somehow, when I take
  print outs of documents using the PC fonts, the font does not quite look like the
  original. \r\nThe PC fonts on paper look kind of thick. On Mac they look fine and
  detailed.\r\n\r\nIn Mac they look great on print as well as screen.\r\n\r\nI am
  using FontLab. \r\nI did not change UPM value. It was 1000.\r\nI exported to Type
  1 format for PC from FFIL format on Mac.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me where I am going
  wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nSuddha Satta Ray\r\n\r\n\r\n"
