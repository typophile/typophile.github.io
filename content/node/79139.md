  />\r\n\r\nFrom designer Christian Schwartz on [[http://christianschwartz.com/amplitude.shtml|christianschwartz.com]]:\r\n\r\n<cite>In
  school, I often used Matthew Carter's Bell Centennial, originally designed for telephone
  directories, as a display face. I liked the striking and unique forms created by
  the \"ink traps\", spaces carved out where strokes converged that would later be
  filled in by the expansion of ink on paper. Without these notches, forms would fill
  in to the point of illegibility. While I was working at Font Bureau, we had a lot
  of newspaper projects come through the studio, and I got some hands-on experience
  with the specific demands of printing small type on absorbent paper. Amplitude is
  a reaction to these two factors, and is essentially an agate face drawn for display.</cite>"
