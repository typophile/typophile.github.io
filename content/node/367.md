    target="_blank"> Old Contact</a> -- Ortiz-Lopez, similiar, not the same. The most
    obvious disimiliarity is the direction of the lowercase g. <BR> <BR>Very nice
    sample. Being that the two lc g shown aren&#39;t the exact same, I&#39;d say this
    was painted. Possibly, probably, from a sample. Or, it is digital, but the sign
    company has had it for yeeeaaaarrrrrssss.  <BR> <BR>
