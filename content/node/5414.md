body: 'Hello all. I kind of disappeared from Typophile for a stretch, and this logo
  is one of the reasons. Right now, the client and I are making the final decisions.
  This is great, because that means we can roll this sucker out soon. This is tough,
  because I think we have slightly different preferences. So, I&#39;m interested in
  your opinions. However, I&#39;m not so much interested in logo tweaking advice,
  and more interested in your general preference between the three options: <BR> <BR>We
  call this the &#34;quarter mark&#34;. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39566.gif"
  alt="TA logos 1A"> <BR> <BR>We call this the &#34;radiating mark&#34;. <BR><img
  src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39567.gif" alt="TA logos 1B"> <BR>
  <BR>This is essentially a combination of attributes of both 1A and 1B. <BR><img
  src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39568.gif" alt="TA logos 1C"> <BR>
  <BR>There are some little bits that I&#39;ll be adjusting &#40;particularly in 1c&#41;,
  but these are essentially the 3 final options. If someone asked you to choose, which
  would you? &#40;Rationales for choices are welcomed.&#41; <BR> <BR>FYI: The logo
  is for a theatre advocacy/promotional group that produces no theatre, but coordinates
  theatres in the Greater Philly area. Their <a href="http://www.theatrealliance.org/">
  website</a> shows their current logo. I&#39;m helping them rebrand as a more substantial
  and professional cultural institution &#40;celebrating its 10th anniversary this
  year&#41; to match changes being made in the organization. The mark accompanying
  the type is actually a capital T rotated at a regular interval. &#39;The Alliance&#39;
  is the shortened version that they&#39;re considering for common usage, with the
  extended name being reserved for more formal use. <BR> <BR>Some of you may recognize
  the type from an <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/read.php?file=/4105/33192.html">Uppercase
  critique thread</a> from a few months ago. As you can see, it took a slightly different
  direction. '

  body: 'Considering usage for theatre related applications, I favor concept C. The
    &#34;TA&#34; is emphasized in the more subtle burst as opposed to the intense
    red burst in concept A, which I think is appropriate. I like the thought of using
    the quarter mark on the lower left corner of pieces for a couple of reason: &#40;1&#41;
    It provides a lot of important real estate for visuals, and &#40;2&#41; if I have
    the correct perception of this organization&#39;s function, the lower left corner
    of the page is an appropriate hierarchical location for the mark also. <BR> <BR>On

  body: Hi Chris -- <BR> <BR>I think that &#39;Greater&#39; and &#39;Philadelphia&#39;
    in the subline get too close. In other words, I don&#39;t think the swash R adds
    to the overall beauty. Have you considered a normal R? It may be less disturbing
    to the name above. <BR> <BR>Have you tested the mark on colleagues and family
    -- regarding the pictural element? How will they react to the flag-like elements.
    <BR> <BR>Overall, a very nice mark. The typography is good. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren

  body: Chris,  <BR>very nice designs, they have a Shakespearian feel to them which
    definitely says theater even in the abbreviated &#34;The Alliance&#34; version.
    Yet, it also looks modern so the design will work no matter what kind of performance.
    My favorite is 1A. I like the dimensionality of the mark better than the straight
    forward gradation used in the other two. Something you should consider though,
    is their overall budget for printing, if they will always use a quality printer
    who can hold the subtle tone changes again I say 1A. If frequently they&#39;ll
    end up using a quick-e printer and the quality may be so-so then I vote for 3A
    - it&#39;s a little easier/safer to reproduce. I&#39;d hate to see that beautiful
    logo turn into a splotchy blob.

  body: 'David, the mark is partially the result of a project requirement for no representational
    designs &#40;their current <a href="http://www.theatrealliance.org/images/logos/tagp_main.gif">logo</a>
    is representational, which they want to change&#41;. <BR> <BR>My specific rationale
    is as follows: the Theatre Alliance is/ wants to be a centerpoint for the Greater
    Philly Theatre community and theatre-goers visiting or living in the area. The
    mark itself uses a radial form built with capital Ts &#40;which stands for &#39;theatre&#39;,
    of course&#41;. While not necessarily overt, the idea is that theatres working
    with the Theatre Alliance, which represents <i>many</i> theatres, extend their
    abilities and effects compared to those of an individual theatre. Finally, and
    perhaps most importantly, it&#39;s a striking mark that, as it did for Kirsten
    and others, evokes theatrical images without literal theatrical imagery &#40;at
    least not intentionally&#41;. I also chose the central circular form to make an
    oblique visual reference to the wax seals used on official proclamations, supported
    by the rich red color. <BR> <BR>Although, I admit, the flags reading of the mark
    is unexpected. No one noticed the flags until now... I wonder if others in the
    organization will see them.'

  body: IMPO <BR> <BR>I am not reading the T&#39;s in the form created. I do see the
    flags. What does the Manitia typeface have to do with Philadelphia Theaters? The
    whole logo seems a little to &#34;Dracula&#34; and &#34;Jekyl and Hyde&#34; to
    me. Doesn&#39;t Really work for &#34;Anne&#34; and &#34;Fidler on the Roof&#34;.
    IMPO I would try and simplify the mark. I saw a mark recently along the same topic
    line you should check it out.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.timessquarebid.org/"

  body: I&#39;m not sure that I agree with David on this one. If I understand the
    purpose of &#34;The Alliance&#34;, then the identity doesn&#39;t belong in the
    theatre &#40;&#34;Anne&#34; and &#34;Fidler on the Roof&#34;&#41;, but rather,
    in the general industry. People within any industry generally want to be viewed
    as taking their work seriously &#40;I know there are exceptions&#41;, and I think
    this mark accomlishes that.

    forced to defend your work. That Times Square logo&#39;s very interesting, too.
    This back-and-forth is bringing up some good issues for discussion with the client.

    compromise, strength, unity, security, group, resourcefulness, leadership, BOND.
    Bond being the most important. I feel that the mark shown has really in fact blurred
    these descriptions listed above as opposed to adhere to them. '
