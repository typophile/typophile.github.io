body: "I am looking for a typeface to set the following quote:\r\n\r\n\"I write without
  seeing. This is the first time I have ever written in the dark\u2026not knowing
  whether I am indeed forming letters. Wherever there will be nothing, read that I
  love you.\"\r\n\r\nIt's from a letter (roughly mid 1700s). I intend to get this
  as a tattoo, so I'd like it either professionally set or hand drawn. I'm a competent
  typographer but for this I need a true artist. \r\n\r\nCan anyone offer any suggestion
  on where I might start?\r\n\r\nThank you so much.\r\n\r\nTim"

    it sounds like you'll need a budget.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    round a limb, or be foursquare on the torso?\r\nYou will need a layout \uFB01rst,
    and, as Hrant suggests, that will be informed by a consideration of the terrain
    on which it will be placed."

  body: 'I realize this isn''t something I would expect something to do for free.
    I''m aware of how much skill this requires. I''d rather it not be set flush left,
    paragraph style...unless it''s done in an unexpected way. I was thinking about
    wrapping it around my arm, in the style of a (hollywood) Egyptian snake bracelet.
    I''m also open it it in my side or by back. I''d work with the artist to find
    the ideal location for the setting. '

  body: "If it's going to spiral around a limb legibility can't be central, so I would
    consider making the line look solid by using all-caps (or uncial). So maybe something
    like this:\r\nhttp://typography.net/fontfamilies/view/16\r\n\r\nUnless it's important
    for it to have a French pedigree.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the general idea."

  body: "Thank you for your suggestions. I'm not sure I want to go as dramatic as
    Sloop, even though that might be accurate. My favorite typefaces are meaty serifs
    like Dolly, Absara, Fedra, Skolar, etc. The era is completely wrong but since
    it's going to be on my body maybe I'm best off just making something I like? It's
    difficult to say, really. \r\n\r\nThanks you both!"

  body: "Is there a better word? I'm not an expert. Meaty always felt right to me....it's
    how I describe the contemporary fonts that manage to look both modern and traditional
    at the same time (I'd go so far as to add Dederon and Malaga but they are perhaps
    a stretch). I don't have much formal training so I'm afraid I have to make up
    descriptors as I go along. \r\n\r\nSutturah is a bit meatier than I need :) I'd
    give that one \"Corpulent\". "

    way to reverse the text out of hatching or scribbles, like lettering revealing
    itself out of darkness?
