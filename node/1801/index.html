		<div class="commentbody">Just installed Panther. First impressions: <BR> <BR>* DAMN fast compared to Jaguar <BR> <BR>* some bug with the Input Menu/Keyboard layouts - since the US is default but I need to use Estonian, I switch to Estonian, but every once in a while the system switches me back to US. REALLY annoying. Hope there's a fix/workaround/option somewhere, I'll keep looking. <BR> <BR>* FontBook is VERY fast (and very&hellip; umm&hellip; simple and reasonable) compared to Suitcase. After installing the software I'll see about how it will function with different apps. <BR> <BR>* Disappointed with what they've done with the default typeface on Finder/Safari/Other apps.

		<div class="commentbody">Very happy with Panther so far. The speed of the finder is  <BR>much improved. It's faster/smoother. (I'm on a G4/667). I'll  <BR>let you know what I think of FontBook after I've used for a  <BR>while. <BR> <BR>What I didn't realize from the FontBook demo at TypeCon is  <BR>that you can search for fonts (unlike Suitcase.) For example,  <BR>searching for 'ding' reveals Webdings, Wingdings and Zapf  <BR>Dingbats on my system. (I'm looking forward to searching  <BR>for light or small caps or round or inline or smallcaps.) This  <BR>is a feature I've long wished for. <BR> <BR>FontBook also has a &quot;Keyboard Viewer&quot; very similar to the  <BR>old &quot;Key Caps&quot; applet where you can preview characters  <BR>with various keystrokes. The improvement over Key Caps is  <BR>you can select a font to preview it in. Very handy, especially  <BR>for dingbat fonts. <BR> <BR>The &quot;show font file&quot; command is sweet. It locates the font  <BR>in the finder. <BR> <BR> <BR>_______ <BR> <BR>So, halfway through writing this I just discovered that  <BR>Suitcase 10.1.3 &quot;unexpectedly quits&quot; whenever I launch it.  <BR>Ouch. I've gotta sleuth that one out and get back to you.)</div>

My only recommendation if you update Suitcase is to let their installer do all the talking. I thought I would be helpful and manually delete a bunch of Suitcase support files in Classic, and X1 crashed continuously after updating. A clean install of X1 over a fresh install of 10.1.x worked.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Seems to me everything is much MUCH improved in Panther: besides Finder (on steroids) the software runs smoother, the whole system customization is a lot faster, logins/boots are lightning fast etc. <BR> <BR>FontBook is right now probably not the hardcore tool to immediately replace the likes of ATM (may it rest in peace) or Suitcase. But if you have enough time to browse/compare/activate your fonts manually and you are very well aware of what is going on in your Fonts folders, it is extremely reasonable replacement to these tools.  <BR> <BR>It is fast, very simple and what's the best part - Apple most likely created it to develop it into the next Suitcase or ATM. I mean this is just version one. So, let's give it some time and I bet it will become a really powerful tool. <BR> <BR>Meanwhile I still have the problem with the Input Menu swicthing. Tried to swap my background picture for .jpg, but Panther still keeps changing my keyboard layout from Estonian back to US. <BR> <BR>It is probably a thing many users could not care less about, but do trust me - there are a lot of people using non-US keyboard&hellip; And it is a really annoying bug. Does anyone know if there's a workaround to tweak the system so, that Estonian could be the Input Menu language?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">All the Font Book features Joe talks about are available in <BR>FontAgent Pro (minus the keycaps thing which is already <BR>accessible through the &quot;Character Palette&quot; in OS X's input <BR>menu). But FontAgent Pro (and the other third-party <BR>managers) have one thing Font Book is missing: auto- <BR>activation. For those who haven't benefited from the goodness <BR>of this feature, it automatically activates all the fonts in any <BR>Illustrator/Photoshop/Quark/InDesign document when you  <BR>open it. This saves a ton of time for those who have many  <BR>clients/jobs/fonts to work juggle. <BR> <BR>Could Apple implement this in Font Book? Probably, and they <BR>might do it better than Extensis or Insider. But will they? I <BR>would be surprised. It would be the single feature that would <BR>make those third party utilities obsolete, effectively pulling <BR>the plug on an entire (though admittedly smallish) sector of  <BR>OS X software.  <BR> <BR>No, I don't see anything new going into Font Book. <BR>It's an excellent manager for the majority of OS X users, the <BR>sort of thing the Mac OS should have been built with from <BR>the beginning. But pro users will need something more, <BR>and it would be dumb for Apple to flip off two longstanding  <BR>developers and supply the goods themselves. <BR> <BR><i>(pardon the poor writing. this was written too late at night. <BR>gee, i wish i was still in the same time zone as all you kids.)</i></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen, you may be right about Apple not wanting to obliterate the other font-management apps, but it didn't hesitate to push ATM Deluxe out the door, and surely Adobe had the greatest market share (or maybe they were neck-and-neck with Extensis) in that area before OS X. <BR> <BR>Apple also hasn't had any qualms about challenging Microsoft in the browser and presentation-software arenas (arenae?).

		<div class="commentbody">ATM Deluxe was never <i>that</i> great. From what I remember, you had to double click to view a font, which it then brought up in a new window. So to compare 3 fonts, you would have 4 windows open. It did, however, always auto-activate without problem. The current Suitcase is better than ATMD ever was. <BR> <BR>Somewhat related: If you Illustrator 10/OS X users uncheck all of the options when saving native files, Suitcase will not auto-activate the fonts in that file the next time you open it.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, <BR>I am a little conservative when it comes to functions and programs which I really like the way they are. <BR>One reason for sticking with OS 9 as long as I have was the way I use ATM Deluxe: to me, its auto-activation function is THE way to save time when switching between jobs. As a freelance writer-designer of FontShop publications I use hundreds of fonts.  <BR> <BR>So let me get this straight. A font management program for me needs to have 3 features: <BR>- auto-activation <BR>- drag-and-drop creation of subsets (as in ATM-Deluxe) <BR>- search feature based on parts of fontnames (&quot;name contains&hellip;&quot;). <BR>I understand FontBook won't give me that right now.

Deleted a family, and  I was able to add all of the incomplete family (so it's not corrupt fonts).   <BR> <BR>Also, some font names are strange - a small number, the family name, two asterisks,  the style and a BIG number, ie &quot;8 BauerBodoni** Black 09033&quot;. These  names show up in any application that uses the OS X font panel for font selection.  Apps that use internal font handling (Illustrator) show expected font names, no  matter what Font Book says.   <BR> <BR>There seems to be random problems adding fonts as well - sometimes it won't.   <BR> <BR>You can't install and manage duplicate fonts, such as different versions (some  clients are picky about versions). Probably has something to do with the PS font  file names - while you can keep different suitcase names, PS file names are fixed,  so you can't have two copies of the PS files in the font folder. No sub folder  organization to work around this, unless you manually copy fonts to the fonts  folder.   <BR> <BR>Back to SuitCase.   <BR> <BR> <BR> Adam Yellin <BR> I tried using the Font Book instead of Suitcase and my fonts all came out jumbled,  so went back to using Suitcase for now. There is nowhere I can find that even  tells us how to use Font Book properly. Like how to remove fonts from it without  deleting them from the drive entirely.  <BR> <BR>Are these reports useful here? If it's just clutter, let me know &amp; I'll stop.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">first post, just wanted to share some notes on the nasty little beast called FontBook <BR> <BR>By default, FontBook MOVES fonts into your user/library/fonts folder - meaning, if you have a nice little organized folder of fonts divided up into categories or whatnot - it moves your fonts out of there. <BR>Guess what happens if you remove one of these fonts from FontBook? <BR>Does it put them back where it got 'em?  <BR>Oh no no! <BR>It TRASHES them. <BR>Granted, you just gotta drag stuff back off your CD/archive or whatnot - but this is really annoying. <BR>It took me awhile to figure out why my fonts were disappearing. <BR> <BR>To solve this - open FontBook prefs and check 'Always copy fonts when adding' <BR> <BR>another thing - I can't get Univers to work. Period. It works fine in OS9, and in Jaguar - but in Fontbook it turns it to all caps garbled junk with nice little accents above all the letters. Doesn't explort in flash correctly. <BR> <BR>Also, in flash, i have several perfectly fine fonts displaying with random distorted triangles instead of spaces and one letter in DIN had a corner blown out clear across the screen. <BR>It's just a display bug - they exported correctly - but it's just another example of some nasty display problems. <BR> <BR> <BR>Oh, and Suitcase is apparently broken in Panther. <BR>They're aware of the issue and are working to correct it. <BR>Why they didn't iron this out BEFORE Panther was released, I don't know. <BR> <BR>//Drew <BR></div>

This seems true to Apple's pattern.  <BR>iTunes, Mail, iChat, iPhoto and Safari all started as fairly  <BR>bare bones, but stable, apps (except for Final Cut which was  <BR>solid from the start).

This negates my anal organization of all my  <BR>fonts by foundry (but doesn't offer the robust organization/ <BR>categorization of iTunes). <BR> <BR>In the meantime, all Stephen's drum beating for FontAgent  <BR>makes me wish I'd selected more carefully.

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, I did a 'dirty' install on my pre-Quicksilver G4 (dual 450s). I was running a shoddy upgrade of 9.2 (from 9.1.2) and had non-critical problems all over. I was too eager to upgrade Friday night, so I just ran the Panther installer right over top of the old OS. It works flawlessly. <BR> <BR>I had a problem once when it woke up stupid (after being asleep all night) and I lost fast user switching until I restarted, but that's been it. Everything came over fine. <BR> <BR>However, I'd like to add that I don't have a font manager (besides Font Book) yet, so I can't comment on how that goes. <BR> <BR>I'm very happy with Panther thus far. I work primarily with classic apps and they all work well (of course QX 4.1 still has redraw issues, like Jaguar). I have Jaguar on a much faster machine at work (quicksilver G4, dual 867s), and it runs comparably.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've upgraded to panther and I have had some serious font issues. All was well. Was using suitcase in Panther and I had no problems. Then I remembered one of the reasons I had upgraded. Fontbook! Tried it out. Thought it was nice, but I still prefered Suitcase. Then later, I wanted to play some more in Fontbook but forgot to quit Suitcase. That is when all hell broke loose.  <BR> <BR>I'm still not certain what happened, but it seems that any of the fonts that I had in Fontbook became corrupted and Suitcase (and even Font Agent Pro) would balk at even the idea of using or adding them again into those apps. <BR> <BR>Luckily, after wipping my system clean to figure this out, I just pulled the fonts that were damaged from some duplicates off a fireewire drive that I have and all seems to be working in the land of Panther. <BR> <BR>Just thought I'd warn everyone to be VERY carefull about having Fontbook open with other font management apps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One of my favorite features in Suitcase X1 (which I'm currently using) is the ability to preview multiple fonts at once. As far as I can tell (as the case has to be as I found no documentation the thing) Font Book can't do that. <BR> <BR>I disabled FontBook and things seem to be chugging along nicely with Panther despite Extensis' remarks that suitcase was not compatible and needed updating. Perhaps they were speaking of Suitcase 10.x and not X1. <BR> <BR>I did an &quot;upgrade&quot; install on my 17&quot; Powerbook. Panther runs like a dream.

I tried to resolve the issue with Suitcase X1. Suitcase found over 200 corrupted fonts, cool problem fixed, right? No. There are still 168 fonts that Suitcase shows as installed, but don't actually exist. I can't get rid of them. It was taking our computer 5 minutes at least to load Flash.  <BR> <BR>Basically we have to reinstall Panther. I'm never opening FB again, and I think it's a joke that Apple released such a buggy program. Especially for a platform intended for designers.
