body: A friend and I are going on our first trip out to [[New York City]] (while getting
  back to Vancouver in time for TypeCon) and I was wondering if anyone on here has
  any pointers in regard to either things to see and do or even some non-touristy
  fare (if anyone knows of any good book stores (design or otherwise) that would be
  great too). Thanks!

  body: "Thank you for visiting my large hometown. I moved away in 1999\u2014but I
    can tell you\u2014you are in for the time of your lives. The touristy things one
    does there would be The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, The United Nations
    (still worth the tour), the musuems (pick your interest: Musuem of Art with Vermeers
    and Rembrandts and a Pisarro; Museum of Modern Art; across the street was a small
    museum on American Folkart - I don't know if it lasted; The Frick Museum\u2014it
    was a private residence for the Fricks, and on death they turned it over as a
    museum, complete with a trustfund; The Guggenheim\u2014if you are into Frank Lloyd
    Wright, it was dedicated in 1959 (still remember the dedication); want to see
    a Guttenberg bible? (one of six or seven remaining) it is always on display at
    the Pierpont Museum on 36th and Madison (not a touristy Museum at all!) \r\n\r\nOther
    great things would be walking! Yep around Chinatown, Wall Street, SoHo (Which
    in Manhattan stands for South of Houston St) oh, cannolis at Ferrara's\u2014best
    cappucino around.\r\n\r\nThe Empire State Building is always a pleasure. Not just
    for it's history (one of the first modular structures put up, deaths in making
    it, first King Kong movie shot there, airplane during WWII flew into it, immortalized
    in many a movie...) but it's a nice place to get a great view of the city.\r\n\r\nBarnes
    & Noble has a rare book section in their branch in the Teens. The street you cross
    over, to get to Store 2 -- is their stacks dept.\r\n\r\nIf the Strand still exists
    - that's pure book heaven. http://www.strandbooks.com:80/app/www/p/home/\r\n\r\nOn
    59th Street between Madison and Fifth was an old bookmaker. Outside his shop were
    antique maps and very rare books. I always wondered why no one just took them...\r\n\r\nOn
    Fifth Avenue was the old Schrieber's (? - memory going) it was bought out by a
    chain\u2014however, if you are into architecture, they left the outside and inside
    alone. Another great walking area - 5th Avenue from 42nd to Central Park.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are into statues - please do check out Central Park. One of my favorites was
    the full size Alice in Wonderland. I really believe they made it to compete with
    the smallish Peter Pan in Hyde Park, London. And if you are in NY for the summer,
    check out the Shakespeare Fesitival in the Park - I believe it is still free,
    and always well done. A true NY Treat.\r\n\r\nThere are so many places to visit
    (it can take a lifetime) I just want you to be a bit on guard though. If you or
    your friend have a pocketbook, place it around your neck with the flap toward
    your body. It is amazing how many little fingers try to get in. If you are staying
    at a hotel, keep your valuables in the safe with the concierge\u2014otherwise,
    maids have a habit of picking up what does not belong to them. Manhattan is fine,
    you really don't have to worry about where you can and can't walk. If you venture
    off the Island\u2014there are still many places to visit and see, and safely.
    (Like the Botanical Gardens and the Bronx and Brooklyn, or the Brooklyn aquarium.)\r\n\r\nIt
    really depends on your likes and dislikes and what you want to see. New York City
    is wonderful because it has it all. And what is not in the city, is only a small
    commute away. (Beach anyone?)\r\n\r\nEnjoy - and of course, send my regards to
    Broadway... don't forget the shows!"

    was bought out by a chain</cite>\r\n\r\nIf you mean Scribners, it's a Benetton
    now.\r\n\r\nBookstores: \r\nThe Urban Center, on Madison btw (I think) 50 and
    51st St.\r\nMoMA has a great bookstore (as do some of the other museums)\r\nPrinted
    Matter in Chelsea\r\nbeyond that it's mostly B&N and Borders these days... my
    two favorites are gone: Untitled and the Dia shop\r\n\r\nThe Cooper Hewitt's Design
    Triennial is up now but not sure it will still be up when you get here - it closes
    July 29\r\n\r\nI'd go to Coney Island since they're tearing it down this fall
    - at least a large section of it. It's not touristy either.\r\n\r\n53rd btw 5th
    & 6th contains 3 great museums, MoMA, the Museum of Art and Design (MAD) and the
    Folk Art Museum.\r\n"

  body: "And my favourite place: The Cloisters.  Accessible via the A train and a
    lovely walk through Fort Tryon Park, where the motorcycle chase in <a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0062824/\"><em>Coogan's
    Bluff</em></a>--an early-ish, somewhat forgotten, and very underrated Clint Eastwood
    film--was shot.  If you love the Middle Ages, the Cloisters are a must-see: furniture,
    stained glass, and architecture.\r\n\r\nBest part is that one admission gets you
    in there as well as the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Take the bus from the Cloisters
    and it drops you right at the MMA's doorstep, complete with a bus tour of northern
    Manhattan.  ;-)"

  body: "How could I forgot the Cloisters - and never touristy...so many folks don't
    want to go that far North in Manhattan. Did you know that in the Cloisters' building
    was brought over stone by stone and reassembled here - and in the 1980s there
    was talk of disassembling it and moving it further up the Hudson? Wonderful memories
    there...\r\n\r\nAnd Linda, thank you for letting me know the Folk Art Museum is
    still there - that place is a panic. When it opened it did so with a huge exhibition
    on Denim. Yep, what every artist out there could make using their old LEVYs...\r\n\r\nAnd
    Scribner's -- thanks Patty - the brain is null and void - I should be playing
    the Scarecrow and not Auntie Em :-)\r\n\r\nBTW - if you are into College Campuses
    - NYU is city-sprawled over the Village (Greenwich Village to you), City College
    is a great campus with two quads (and used in <em>Majorie Morningstar</em} (I
    believe that was the movie) as Harvard, Columbia on the West Side - and then stop
    at Zabars... the original yuppie coffee grinder hangout... LOL"

    but Washington Square Park is amusing for people watching.\r\n\r\nThere is also
    a lot of free entertainment in NY in the summer - concerts and films in the various
    parks. It's all too numerous to list here (and I really should be working). Summerstage,
    Celebrate Brooklyn, and River to River come to mind."
