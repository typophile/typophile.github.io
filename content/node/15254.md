body: "In my typography class we were all given 3 typefaces from different time periods
  to research and create typographic specimens for. There will be 3 spreads; one for
  each typeface. We are supposed to connect our 3 typefaces through a theme to unify
  the spreads. I am having a tough time coming up with a concept to link them all
  together. We should have around 500 words in our copy for each spread. My typefaces
  are:\r\n\r\nFette Fraktur\r\nDIN Neuzeit\r\nInterstate\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any
  ideas? I was thinking I could make some sort of \"labels\" for products of the time
  period they are from. Another idea was to relate the architecture styles of the
  time periods they were created in.\r\n\r\nFill me in with your thoughts or ideas!
  I could sure use some help with this one... \r\n*I forgot to mention that I do not
  need to use the things these three have in common, I can also play off of the contrast
  these 3 have between eachother."

    DIN is clear and interstate too, right? im not a THAT big type-freak, but that
    should work?"

  body: "The obvious thing would be to use a transportation theme, since DIN and Interstate
    are highway fonts; for the fraktur you could have a fictional scenario where Germany
    never started WWII and now uses fraktur for road signage - since the Nazis actually
    ended up banning blackletter eventually, and it can be argued that the German
    reliance on blackletter might have continued otherwise.\r\n\r\nA more creative
    idea might be to have some kind of confrontation between the three: the fraktur
    could complain that the other two are frigid; the DIN might bitch about Interstate
    being a fat burger-gobbler, etc.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: As far as the transportation or roadsign theme, there are ways that it might
    work pretty well... Correct me if I am wrong, but one of the main reasons that
    DIN came to be, was to be used as for Germany alone? Is that still its purpose
    in Germany today? That makes a pretty good scenario for how I can relate Fraktur
    and DIN... But then what about Interstate?

    our 3 typefaces through a theme to unify the spreads\"\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm misreading
    the word \"specimens\" and what you mean is \"examples of good use\", but, Normally,
    when making a series of \"typographic specimens\", the typographer shows the fonts
    in a variety of sizes within the family, a mix of styles, an \"all-characters\"
    composition, and if space-paper permits, an example of use, like a box of Tide,
    a business card or, etc...and if even more space permits in good contrast with
    other families of type.\r\n\r\nIn most traditional specimens, the connecting theme
    is the layout itself, which is commonly simple, allowing each typeface family
    freedom to be composed as the \"voice of the face requests\", avoiding the need
    to make up \"a history\" of Germany in order to get 3 pretty different fonts into
    the same connecting \"use\" ;)\r\n"
