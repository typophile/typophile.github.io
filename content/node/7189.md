  body: Thanks Yves, Comics is close, but just not quite what I&#39;m looking for...
    i&#39;ve actually been looking for this font for a while and come across Comics
    with little satisfaction... i know it&#39;s out there somewhere!!

    target="_blank">Homestar Runner</a> &#40;also on the &#34;Don&#39;tcha Like Me???&#34;
    ID request--from one of the <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/marshie.html"
    target="_blank">fake Fluffy Puff Marshmallow ads</a>&#41;. I think the Chapmans
    do a lot of their own fonts. Not sure if that&#39;s the case here though.

  body: Haha, you got me, Mark.  I&#39;ve ID&#39;d most of the fonts on Homestar myself,
    and most of them are pre-existing, actually... I figured they spend enough time
    on the toons themselves than to keep making their own fonts... <BR> <BR>Also,
    the &#34;don&#39;tcha like me??&#34; ID looks alot like the one used in the online
    comedy series <a href="http://www.redvsblue.com">Red Vs. Blue</a> in their main
    logo, so methinks that one may be pre-existing as well...

  body: I&#39;ve got your answer. It&#39;s Comix Heavy, an old Weatherly Systems font
    &#40;WSI&#41;. Unfortunately, Weatherly doesn&#39;t license its fonts anymore.

  body: Ah, shoot... thanks though, James.  Yeah, the Brethren Chaps have been using
    that font for a while I think... so they probably snatched it up before it went
    off the market.  Thanks again.
