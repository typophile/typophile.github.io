  body: Marketing is not a one-shot deal.  A series of brief non-interruptive exposures
    is far better than a huge wad of everything at once. Send a greeting card; a week
    or so later a small but stunning piece of your work; a week or so later, a resume
    and portfolio pdf; and like that...
