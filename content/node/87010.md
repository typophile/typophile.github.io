body: Hi! I'm in desperate need of finding a very similar (if not the same) late 19th
  century display face just as the one pictured. This style is referred to as Tuscan,
  correct? I have found some, but I really like the look of the "R" in this one and
  haven't found any that are very similar. Help please?
