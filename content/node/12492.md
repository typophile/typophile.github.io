body: "I was searching for a font called Architype Renner, part of a series that includes
  Architype Van Doesburg, Architype Tschichold, Architype Bayer, Architype Van Der
  Leck and Architype Bill. \r\nThese fonts were formerly sold through Fonthaus. \r\nThe
  collection can now be purchased from Foundry in the UK ((Freda Sack and David Quay's
  company, home of Gridnik). \r\nhttp://www.foundrytypes.co.uk \r\n(Architype 2, which
  they also sell, includes Architype Renner Bold, Architype Albers, Architype Bayer-Type,
  Architype Ballmer, Architype Schwitters, Architype Aubette). \r\n\r\n"

  body: Yes, they can certainly be <em>found</em> there, but good luck getting The
    Foundry to actually <em>sell</em> any of them to you. I came across Architype
    Renner myself, after reading about the design of [[Futura]] in [[Robert Bringhurst]]'s
    [[Elements of Typographic Style]] and trying to see if I could find the original,
    more radical letter forms Bauer had opted to omit from the typeface as they issued
    it. Unfortunately, the folks at the Foundry are sometimes unresponsive to queries.
    Let us know if you get ahold of them. It would be nice to know how much they want
    for the Architype collections.
