  &#34;Fontlab file&#34;, sometime a list of &#34;-Bold, -Regular, -Italic&#34;, sometime
  a wrong list, some other time the right list, but I can&#39;t choose any option.  <BR>The
  problem is that not only the name are wrong, but I can&#39;t choose the file format
  to generate a font &#40;and so I can&#39;t generate a font!!!!!&#41;.  <BR>I tried
  to erase the preferences and to reinstall the program, but nothing changed. I created
  a new user and everything works, but, after a short period, the problem starts again.  <BR>I
  changed computer, everything worked, but after two weeks the problem started again.  <BR>I
  can&#39;t create a new user or change computer every 2 weeks.  <BR>What happens?
  What I have to change to recover my fontlab? There is any preference outside the
  prefences files in the &#34;preferences&#34; folder &#40;&#34;FontLab 4 Toolbars&#34;
  and &#34;com.fontlab.fontlab4.plist&#34;&#41;?  <BR>Do someone know what to do?'

  body: I&#39;ve once seen the same problem on a Mac. It IS possible to export the
    font, but you have to select something like &#34;-Bold&#34; instead of OTF. The
    menu is simply shifted, but all the formats are available.

  body: Our engineers report that this indeed is a bug that will be fixed in the next
    release of FontLab. The bug appears when too many fonts are installed. The workaround
    for v4.6 is to turn off some fonts. <BR> <BR>Adam

  body: Hi Luciano, the only work-around I&#39;ve found is to close down your font
    management software before you generate, and then turn it back on when you&#39;re
    done. <BR> <BR>peter

  body: Hey! This just happened to me! I&#39;m freaking out here. I thought maybe
    it was something to do with the latest OS X update. I re-installed twice and uttered
    many obscenities. Okay...my heart palpitations are easing a bit. <BR> <BR>So this
    is FontLab&#39;s way of telling me I have too damn many fonts, eh? I only have
    353 families. Ugh. Just a few more to go...
