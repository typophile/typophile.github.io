body: WELL,opps....ok well I&#39;m new to Typophile. Now that that is over I want
  to know what the little decorative swirls and floral that are put around letters.
  I couldnt figure out how to post a picture so I hope everyone understands what I
  mean. Are they a form of font. Theyre usually on or around elegant words. If anyone
  gets what I&#39;m talking about, could you help me, I just have a great interest
  in learning how to do them well.

  body: Flourishes maybe, swashes no, engrossing no. Ok not the stuff that attaches
    to the type but the decorations around it.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69441.jpg"

  body: Ornament? Ornamentation? Filigree?  <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;m putting question
    marks after all my suggestions because I&#39;m not exactly sure what the proper
    name for this is, whether there is one, or if I understand precisely what you
    are referring to. Still, one of them might fit.&#41;
