  body: "Awesome. Much appreciated, Ryuk! Any idea exactly which Futura version the
    wide-bold font is?\r\n\r\nThe letter G (from the word GIFT) doesn't look exactly
    like any example that's shown at MyFonts.\r\n\r\nIt looks almost exactly like
    Futura Classic and Futura No 8. Perhaps it's been edited/skewed in PS?!"
