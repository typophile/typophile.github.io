  body: "Sure, just move them from the Adobe common fonts folder at C:\\Program Files\\Common
    Files\\Adobe\\Fonts.\r\n\r\n(If you look at the Adobe's OpenType User Guide it
    explains how to install fonts in general, and covers the locations of the Adobe-specific
    folders.)\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thomas,  Thank you.  It worked like a dream.\r\nBelieve it or not, I spent
    the better part of an hour on the phone with Adobe this afternoon.  They told
    me that there wasn't any way to put CS2 fonts into the Windows Font Folder.  I'm
    glad that I stumbled across Typophile.com this afternoon while searching the web.\r\n\r\nGary"
