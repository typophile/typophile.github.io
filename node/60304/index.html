  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on some designs for a client who is branching out an existing chair wholesaling business. His new business will sell office, executive and designer chairs direct to architects and interior designers.</p>
<p>The business name is Chairs Only and the idea for the logo at the moment is a play on this seemingly uninspired name.</p>
<p>The client is onboard with the idea, but I know the design of the logo is far from good—would love some input to help me develop it into something better,</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>@epsilicon: was a bit concerned about the negative subject, but we were really trying to make it more of a light-hearted gag than something negatively charged. Does this not come across at the moment? Obviously that would be something I would want to fix if thats the case, any suggestions??</p>
<ul>
<li>I totally agree about the pool table—I&rsquo;ll put some work into fixing that up today</li>
</ul>
<p>@lex: thanks—I agree, a set like that would work well and is something I will look into  developing in the future. You&rsquo;re right about the wonky optical illusion. I&rsquo;ll try a few different things. I also can&rsquo;t figure out a good side on of a table as a pictogram. Have you seen any?</p>

<p>The first one has a few elements that I really like and will try and incorporate into the next round of designs.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;ll attach some variations I&rsquo;d already been working on to resolve some of the problems already brought to light. Still don&rsquo;t think either are the right solution but something to think about.</p>
<p>The second one is a bit clumsy, but included to demonstrate how colour (no specific colours have been decided upon yet) might be incorporated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@epsilicon</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I&rsquo;m a bit of a chair nut, so it&rsquo;s a tempting option for me to use but it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve so far deliberately avoided for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>This business does sell a few of the usual suspects (barcelona chair, le corbousier chaise, eames rocker, jacobsen egg, coco nut, etc. etc.) but it isn&rsquo;t their primary market — they mostly distribute standard office and eames line of executive chairs — using geometry from the iconic designs listed would be somewhat misrepresenting the business (and the eames executive chairs have way to many lines to simplify into a logomark..)</p>
<p>The main reason though is the target market. Interior designers and Architects are saturated with images of barcelona chairs to the point that using them to promote a furniture business is beyond the point of cliché. The motivation behind the designs proposed is to break with what this audience is expecting from a chair retailer and also opening up a platform for a visually distinct and expandable brand.</p>
<p>That said, I do acknowledge my solution is still far from perfect (as reflected by your concerns) and any suggestions like yours are very much appreciated.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/typophile3_5628.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Based on the suggestions offered up by Lefty &amp; Lex I&rsquo;ve made a few changes to the design of the table and the cross. I&rsquo;ve used the alternative to a cross like Lefty suggested, and cleaned up the angles of the table to better reflect this change. While there is always room for improvement I&rsquo;m now starting to feel a bit more confident in the execution of this element. What do you think?</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve neglected typography and colour, so turning my attention to that soon. I have been using Gotham but I don&rsquo;t think that is really working as it doesn&rsquo;t reflect the lightheartedness of the graphic. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Much appreciated,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Making the logo modular is definately the way to go—would work really well on the website. Still working on a design with three—it does look a bit busy—so for now here is how it might look with just two</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/typophile5_4015.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Not quite the same effect/message as if there were three (I agree with Lex though, two random objects and one chair) but a start.</p>
<p>@Coe it makes sense to have the &lsquo;ONLY&rsquo; bolded, but it just reads a bit strange. I&rsquo;ve attached it both ways, please let me know if you think I&rsquo;m wrong!</p>

The colors choosen makes it less serious as the first one you have shown.
Maybe you should take it a step further.</p>
<p>The line trough the table asks a lot of attention. Attention which is pulled away from the rest. Beside that it has somethinge severe, serious.</p>
<p>What if you cross it out with sketchy lines? See example (but then better)
<img src="/images/old-images/Afbeelding-1_6011.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Thanks so much for all your ideas and help up till now, I really appreciate it!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a bit of a timetable reshuffle with this client so unfortunately I have to rush some other work through first.</p>
<p>I do however really want to get this logo right (and obviously from the response there is still plenty of room for improvement!), so I&rsquo;ll be back here early next week to keep working it out.</p>
<p>Over the week I&rsquo;m sure all your ideas and suggestions will be bouncing around in my head—will be itching to get back to the drawing board,</p>
<p>Till then,</p>

The logo says &lsquo;No Tables&rsquo; and the name is &lsquo;Chairs Only&rsquo; - they are not exchangeable. A table is not the opposite of a chair, so you will need to include and cross out everything that is not a chair in your logo, a lamp, a cat, a rocket etc. The name chairs only excludes everything but chairs - so focus on chairs…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I would stay away from the scribble outs and the single slash.  I think the X works the best.  Let me quantify these:</p>
<p>Scribble is used typically when you sketch; ideas, concepts, roughs&hellip; anything unfinished.  This is probably not how the company wants to convey themselves.  It&rsquo;s not an idea they are neglecting, it&rsquo;s not a concept, or a sketch or an idea.  The name is a statement:  Chairs ONLY.  Period.  &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do no stink&rsquo;n tables&hellip; chairs only!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The single slash isn&rsquo;t working due to the quick nature of drawing a single slash.  For me, it&rsquo;s like a teacher checking math test problems or an individual slashing out various classified ads, its too quick of a thought and not a statement.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; slash, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; slash, &ldquo;Wrong,&rdquo; slash, &ldquo;Wrong,&rdquo; slash&hellip;</p>
<p>The X is a statement.  &ldquo;Tables ARE wrong.  Beds ARE wrong.  Chairs only.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s very intentional.  Love it.  Go with Lex&rsquo;s suggestion and create multiple &ldquo;X&rsquo;d object&rdquo; logos.  You&rsquo;re starting to formulate their marketing strategy&hellip;</p>
<p>The pure typographic solution using the captial H as a chair is a fun solution as well.  Explore more!</p>
<p>I disagree with epsilicon on the &ldquo;negative charge&rdquo; in the brand simply because as a consumer, I&rsquo;d go to a place called Chairs Only to buy a chair.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure they would know chairs better than some guy at Office Max.  As state above, I took the X as a statement: &ldquo;No Smoking&rdquo;, &ldquo;No shirt, no shoes, no service!&rdquo;</p>

daniel</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I quite like your concept and can see it working - especially if it had the modularity suggested elsewhere.</p>
<p>I also think riccardo&rsquo;s suggestion of the side profile chair could work.</p>
<p>I guess you need to look at the overall brand - what image are they trying to convey? The first is more humorous, playful and interactive, the second more elegant and sophisticated.</p>
<p>A business card or letterhead is one thing but think about how it would live as part of a brand entity. If their imagery is all about style with sexy minimalist close-up product shots then i think the first idea will be more difficult to reconcile.</p>
<p>On another note, maybe the crossed out tables etc would work better as a secondary branding element - say a catalogue cover with a 5x5 grid of product shots, mostly chairs but with two or three shots of another item of furniture crossed out. That could be a theme carried across to other touch points too - website, tags, bags, etc.</p>
<p>The first idea has legs in terms of marketing. Just of the top of my head - some sort of direct mail snap card game, or sponsoring a ummmm&hellip;i dunno&hellip;office wine tasting event for corporate clients, but the imagery used could be a wine bottle silhouette along with a can of fizzy drink and a faucet crossed out. There loads of directions you could take it.</p>
<p>Just some ideas anyway. Look forward to seeing how this progresses.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with the statements that the crossed out table is sort of misleading.</p>
<p>What about somehow drawing an image of several chairs situated around a table - but OMIT the table. (Or maybe make it have a dotted outline or somehow &ldquo;invisible&rdquo;.) That way you will show the chairs, but convey the message that the table is missing / not available.</p>
<p>It may be tricky to acheive, and I&rsquo;m not sure if realistic illustrations of chairs or simplified illustrations would do better.</p>
<p>If you end up pursuing the crossed out table thing, I would make the slash heavier, so it has more visual and conceptual weight.</p>
