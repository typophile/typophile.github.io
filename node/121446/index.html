  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>At the second qualification game, it was quiet different when Germany had to face the Finn team. The game took place in front of a quintuplicate number of spectators at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki. The Finn national team took the lead with one goal within the first half hour but Germany’s skipper Miroslav Klose managed the tie in just five minutes. After another few minutes Germany fell again behind but as well as the first time Germany’s skipper was at the spot and scored for the tie. Then came the half time. Just a few minutes of the second half Finland managed the 3:2 goal and it seemed like this would become the final score. But short time before the final whistle, Klose scored and tied the game. This is how he kept his team from the first defeat.<a href="http://www.alimmogold.com/Aura-Kingdom-Gold_A959/"><a href="http://www.alimmogold.com/Aura-Kingdom-Gold_A959/">http://www.alimmogold.com/Aura-Kingdom-Gold_A959/</a></a></p>
<p>The next opponent of the German team will be the Russian team coached by Guus Hiddink. Russia grinded out a 2:1 victory against Wales last Wednesday. This coming up game will take place in almost one month next October 11th, in Dortmund.</p>
<p>Not as much luck, on the other hand, had the Swiss national team who is headed by former Bundesliga-coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. The team lost after a balanced first half at the end by 1:2 against Luxemburg. Along with the tie from the previous game against Israel, Switzerland is now in the fifth place of their group. There are still eight games to go for Hitzfeld’s team so we will see if they will be able to ensure themselves a ticket to Africa.</p>
<p>Defending champion Italy can breathe again. After the elimination in the quarter finals of the European Cup, the team leads now their group chart.  With two victories against Cyprus and Georgia they accumulated six points.<a href="http://www.alimmogold.com/FIFA-14-Coins_A953/">Purchase Cheap FIFA Coins at Alimmogold.com</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever his motives,&rdquo; Jideonwo concluded, &ldquo;the president has opened up a new channel of popular involvement in Nigerian politics, encouraging young people to feel like they have a voice. This can only be a good thing.&quot;<a href="http://www.alimmogold.com">Wow Gold, Guild Wars 2 Gold, Runescape Gold, Huge Stock &amp; Fast Delivery | Alimmogold.com</a></p>
