body: "OK, what I'm about to say might sound like a complete nonsense, but this thing
  has been bugging me for the past week and a half, and so far I haven't been able
  to come up with a better explanation. So, here it goes:\r\n\r\nIs it just me, or
  fonts with names that include the sequence 'ding' do not work properly in MS PowerPoint
  2004 for Mac (v11.2)?\r\n\r\nI mean, I've generated and tested several dozen fonts,
  and I always arrive to the same result: In all the 'ding' fonts, the access to characters
  outside the ASCII-area is completely messed up.\r\n\r\nIs PowerPoint treating these
  fonts as if they were <strong>ding</strong>bat fonts?"

  body: I can confirm that Wedding Text has the problem you describe. This is with
    PowerPoint 10.1.0. Sounds like you need to rename your font if you want to use
    it with PowerPoint.

  body: I vaguely remember hearing something about this before... but I can't remember
    where. Something about a hard-coded bit of legacy code in Office to identify dingbat
    fonts by name. Perhaps to order them with each other on the font menu? I wish
    I could remember where and from whom I heard this.
