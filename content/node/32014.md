  body: "Hello Jesper Winther, it's a well, we see typefaces on the surfaces.\r\nYou
    want to start from hand-drawn rough <a href=\"http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\">sketches</a>
    or from a whole alphabet of tight drawings. You want always to sketch something
    first (rather than starting from scratch on the computer), but you know already
    that most of the real design work happens once you get the shapes on the computer
    screen because we read and write words not letters, so don\u2019t get sad if you
    spend less time drawing on paper. The iterative process of shaping letters on
    screen and proofing them at different sizes on various machines is where the designing
    happens."

  body: "Searching Typophile - maybe via google is best - is your single best source
    for diversity & richness of information. But it will require a lot of reading,
    and evetually re-reading because the assumed shaded ( or not shared ) contexts
    which you might not get yet. There are also many good books but there is no single
    best or complete source for this topic. You have to assemble your own picture
    of this question from the parts available. \r\n\r\nPartly this is an accident
    of history, the way people think about type has undergone several revolutions
    in the last 100 years, partly this is because what looks like one thing is hyper-complex.
    Plus, it's not a question just of how you make type but rather how type is used;
    actually that's just history; instead it's a question of what it's used for, and
    then you can work back. Erik Spiekermann has a nice quote about that which I don't
    seem to be able to find just now. Anyybody?\r\n\r\nThe one book that I know of
    that does the best job of attempting to circle the whole field is Ellen Lupton's
    'thinking with type'.\r\n\r\nISBN-10: 1568984480 ISBN-13: 978-1568984483\r\n\r\nhttp://www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/\r\nhttp://typographi.com/000917.php\r\n\r\nThat
    might be a good place to jump in from.\r\n\r\nEllen, if you read this: I would
    like a bigger inside margins so I don't have to break he spine of the book while
    reading it - see page 141!\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
