  What is a good display face that communicates \"engineering?\" I've seen one that
  was outlined, visible rules for baseline, xheight, etc, and visible circles used
  to determine the geometry of the typeface. Now I can't find it and my searches on
  the font websites is coming up short. Any ides?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nScott"

    overdesigned typeface </a> that matches your description, besides the usual Leonardo.

    body: "Draughtwork is close, but a little too much (don't need the grid)! \"Overdesigned\"
      will work because I'm only using two letters (UT). The Leonardo I have on my
      machine is a handwritten font. Maybe I only have one of the family?\r\n\r\nSince
      I am only using two letters, I may just pick a geometric typeface and add the
      embelishments myself. Thought it'd be simple if I could just use a typeface
      though."

  body: if you only need two letters, do you have, or can you get hold of any rotring/technical
    lettering stencils? you could do the lettering yourself, and scan it in. you'd
    then get a more 'authentic' feel to the lettering as well...
