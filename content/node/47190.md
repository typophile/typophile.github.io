    Polo11R-Buch, Polo22K-Leicht etc.\r\n\r\nI suppose it must be custom."

    after I couldn't find anything about it at the usual places. It is rather difficult
    to find out about isn't it?"

    Polo on the web. It can be purchased only from Georg Salden\u2019s website. Actually,
    I hadn\u2019t seen it for so long, I didn\u2019t recognize it."
