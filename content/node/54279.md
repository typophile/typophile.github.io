  Stijl: Dutch for 'The Style', also known as Neoplasticism. De Stijl sought to express
  spiritual harmony and order. The movement focused on pure abstraction and universality
  by a reduction to the essentials of form and color. They simplified compositions
  to vertical and horizontal lines, and only primary colors along with black and white.

  in Modernist architecture and modern design. The Bauhaus had a profound influence
  upon art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and
  typography."
