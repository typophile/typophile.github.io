body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI know that MM Fonts are not developed any further by Adobe, but
  I have the chance to work with some of these old Adobe MM fonts. Question is how
  to use these in a layout application like InDesign. \r\n\r\nHow does one define
  the axis (of weight, optical size, etc.) in InDesign? Or do fonts have to be generated
  with FontLab before they can be used? I would like to know how this works for a
  normal job. And what about the compatibility? Do they still work in CS5?\r\n\r\nWould
  be great if you have some info on this!"

    Font Creator utility to create instances (also a functionality of ATM Deluxe).
    I can\u2019t remember if you can do this running in Classic or if it has to be
    directly in OS 9 (or earlier).\r\n\r\nThe resulting instances are just PS T1 fonts,
    so you should be able to install and use \u2014 at the very least in the Adobe/Fonts
    folder as James described.\r\n\r\nNo one ever made an in-app interface for defining
    instances on the fly. Part of the reason MM never really gained traction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    weight plus italics for optical size 7 (for example) I have to generate these
    in a font editor and export as PS T1? Is there a way to automize so I can for
    instance create optical sizes in 4 weights simultaneously?"

    -- range of weights in small, text, mid-range, display sizes. These became the
    basis for the Pro Opticals series.\r\n\r\nWhich families are you looking at and
    what sizes are you wanting? \r\n\r\nIf you generate separate fonts out of a current
    font editor, you don\u2019t have to export to PS T1 format. You could just as
    easily generate CFFOTF. Of course, there won\u2019t be any features if you don\u2019t
    write any. But at least you\u2019ll have the more current font format."

    not true. Older versions of Illustrator (version 10 was the last one IIRC) had
    a Multiple Master palette that allowed instant generation of instances. And Quark
    XPress used to have a plug-in (Font Creator?) that allowed the same. I often made
    MM versions of my typefaces early in the process in order to quickly test different
    weight or width settings in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nThe main reason MM failed was
    not technology, but the fact that the majority of graphic designers are not trained/able
    to make decisions on a micro-typographic level. Having a seamless transition between
    weights and widths in a typeface faced most people with too much choice. Life
    is much easier when one can only choose between Regular, Medium and Bold."

  body: 'Thank you Paul for setting the record straight. I can add Lari Software''s
    Lightning Draw GX, which had live sliders for all MM and TT/Variation fonts. No
    special palette to access either - - the sliders were always there. LightningDraw
    also supplied most of the new features of Illustrator between versions 7 and 10
    - - it was an amazing program, way ahead of its time. Thank you James for the
    Illustrator tip - -  a rare example of backward compatibility on the Mac platform.
    Anyone who wants to know how, in the future, a font interface should work, just
    has to find an old Mac and get LightningDraw up and running. '

    because it entered the broad type production culture, thanks to Adobe and Microsoft
    making information about it available, primarily over the Internet, which was
    not a factor back in the early and mid 1990s."
