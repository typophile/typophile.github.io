body: "I am looking to either identify or atleast get some good recommendations on
  which digital typefaces that comes closest to these, the last one is obviously printed
  in current day, so that should be easy enough to find, but the two earlier ones
  are also of higher interest. the \"UD\" which is highly geometric in it's build
  might well be all custom for the sign (ud means exit btw) but i find it in the vein
  of the two non stencil types shown, and maybe you've seen something simelar.\r\n\r\nSorry
  in advance for the somewhat blurry images, ive tried my best, but was working in
  bad lighting conditions, i hope you can still decipher from it.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance, from Copenhagen."

  body: defenetly in the same vein, but still not quite there, is there anybody that
    knows of a stencil type comming close to the geometric build of the "UD" sign?
    - and still, any bids on any of the other faces for that matter.
