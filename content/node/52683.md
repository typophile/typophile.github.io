    the need for holiday dingbats to be decorative with the essential anti-decorativeness
    of Futura.\r\nIn the whose-birthday-is-it-anyway category, I love the El-Lissitzky-meets-Eric-Gill
    treatment that Vargas 74 came up with. \r\nAnd Simon's sozzled St. Nick, while
    not strictly a dingbat, is the most fun."
