body: "I need help pairing Chaparral Pro (body text) with a sans-serif (headlines)
  for my design blog. Chaparral looks very delicate to me with its interesting curves
  and I love it, so I need a typeface that will complement it.\r\n\r\nI have seen
  it paired with Proxima Nova a lot, but I would like to go with something different.
  I like how it looks combined with Brandon Grotesque. Seems to me that it complements
  Chaparral when in all-caps, but not sure if it's overwhelming otherwise (screenshot
  of my testing page attached). Other types I have been experimenting with are Futura
  PT (as a total contrast), then Camingo DOS and FacitWeb. However I am not sure if
  these are really good matches, or it's just my subjective view.\r\n\r\nDo some these
  really work, or you have some other recommendation?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
