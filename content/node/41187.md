  is there a proper way to use these two in the digital domain?  What I'm running
  into is 18pt Photina is not 18pt Univers.  Is there a proper convention of offsetting
  these sizes so that they line up properly?\r\n\r\nAs far as I know there's only
  one digital version of each, Monotype and Linotype respectfully, so pairing specific
  digitizations of these typefaces seems out of the question.\r\n\r\nAny advice on
  this matter is greatly appreciated.  Photina italic shreds."

  body: "I love Photina. It's a shame that Jose Mendoza y Almeida only has two typefaces
    available. \r\n\r\nYour best bet is to just sit them side by side and compare.
    When scaled to similar x-heights, regardless of \"point size\", things should
    match up well.\r\n\r\nSlimbach's Utopia also matches Univers remarkably well when
    scaled to the same size.\r\n"
