  body: "Chesterfield was designed by Alan Meeks for Letraset in 1977. The glyphs
    in the digital Chesterfield, including _T_ and _F_, seem to match the original,
    as shown in my Letraset product catalog from 1985.\r\nChesterfield was also digitizatized
    by Uwe Borchert as Mops Antiqua (Pug Serif) http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-56498.html
    It does not have the modified _T_ and _F_. So I agree with Fivos that the letters
    in_FOUNDATION_ are customized.\r\nDon "
