  body: "It's not DIN--thanks to the full sample, I can see that the numerals don't
    match (specifically, the 6). Same goes for all flavors of OCR.\r\n\r\nThe 4 has
    a gap and a high waist, the top of the 6 is rounded over, the 1 has a sharply
    angled downstroke, and the Q tail is a straight line at about a 45 degree angle.\r\n\r\nLinefeed
    is the closest I found, but the 6 and the Q aren't right:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/linefeed/"
