  bit surprised by it. When the book is written about in historical contexts, it tends
  to be described as a radical manifesto about design that changed everything with
  which it came into contact. But to me it just seems like a practical guide to designing
  legible printed work, preferably according to the new DIN standards. After one gets
  through the beginning of the introduction Tschichold mellows out, explains everything
  pretty clearly, and it seems like the only time he gets a little too pedantic it\u2019s
  because he is trying to force the notion that sanserif type is \u201Cobjective\u201D
  or \u201Cneutral\u201D simply because technical characteristics make it more appropriate
  for the time. Everything else is handled with terse matter-of-fact explanations
  from both business and technical perspectives that make perfect sense. \r\n\r\nSo
  now I am left wondering\u2014did the lack of an English translation prior to 1998
  lead American design historians to overstate the importance, or at least the nature,
  of this book? Or am I just underestimating how horrible design was at the time,
  so that even a simple little guide like <em>The New Typography</em> really was a
  radical work?"

    is best, and fancy effects are unnecessary clutter. Many designers today get caught
    up in Creative Suite updates, and are innocently convinced that the more they
    know about CS3, the better designers they become. Trying to employ the available
    effects can get in the way of developing an understanding of fundamental design
    rules. I can imagine that the flood of new type and technology in the early 20th
    century was causing similar problems, and Tschichold was mostly just saying, \"Hey,
    wait a minute, folks...forget about the bells and whistles for a minute.\" It's
    a good reminder for all of us today, because our flood of new type and technology
    is much deeper than it was circa 1925.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I don't know if works
    for everyone, but Tschichold's persnickity nature and blunt matter-of-factness
    always makes me smile. Maybe it's because he speaks objectively about a topic
    that lots of people see as subjective, and I find it refreshing.\r\n\r\n"

    It was first published in Germany, at a time when most German books were typeset
    in blackletter faces, and when the idea of standardization was still new... Some
    of the Bauhaus principles were revolutionary for the same reason. Herbert Bayer
    wrote about using only lowercase letters in German, a language in which every
    single noun is capitalized. Other contemporary movements, such as Constructivism
    and De Stijl, were also giving shape to modernist design ideas, but it was all
    pretty new back then. Notice that Tschichold provides an address list of \"New
    Typographers\" at the end of the book!\r\n\r\n(If you haven't, go back and read
    Robin Kinross's introduction, which covers many of these points.)\r\n\r\nTo give
    you a similar example from the movies... Perhaps you've heard or read about people
    jumping out of their seats when they saw an approaching train in one of the Lumiere

    in fontplayer's assessment of modernism and why it was so revolutionary:\r\n<em>\"the
    idea of standardization was still new\"</em>\r\n\r\nToday, everything is standardized.
    We have specifications for Opentype and Unicode that will categorize and standardize
    even the most distressed or grungy of typefaces or scripts that only a master
    calligrapher could even dream of creating. We have standardized revivals of typefaces
    that were never standard to begin with, such as Akzidenz Grotesque into Helvetica
    into whatever.\r\n\r\nLayouts now come cut and paste. Design is now a pastiche
    of standardized \"styles\" of yesteryear. \r\n\r\nIf anything, the reason why
    so many people are looking at letterpress/hand-lettering/etc., is because it is
    a reaction against the blandness that comes with standardization.\r\n"

    commercial culture, in Western Europe and America, from 1900-1930.\r\nIt was a
    reaction to the messiness of the emergent mass media and its new technologies,
    a serious, progressive, force. It was in no way traditional, as the very idea,
    for instance, of reviving centuries old typefaces, and Jenson in particular, was
    unprecedented, and quite literally radical.\r\n\r\nHowever, Historicism was so
    pervasive and entrenched that its graphic style must indeed have horrified the
    young and rebellious, so they created its mirror image; out went illustration,
    symmetry, decoration and serifed types, in came photography, asymmetry, plainness
    and sans faces. And the myth of Modernism."

    I'd read quite a lot about Jan Tschichold and this book of his. I was very troubled
    by the fact that I instantly disagreed with many principles Tschichold was trying
    to preach -- my enormous respect for its author (and thus a certain bias in his

    because I've always been a fan of the Classics and disliked the Modern). But we
    are surrounded by modern design nowadays -- it has gained an overwhelmingly dominant
    presence over the classic styles in our daily live. So if people like me, who
    are used to the Modern, still consider The New Typography radical, is it hard
    to imagine how radical it looked to people of that time?\r\n\r\nNow, years after
    reading the book, my opinion about it has actually improved -- I no longer oppose
    some of the content as strongly as I did. I think this book was really *way* ahead
    of its time. Consider this: Less than ten years ago, the majority of magazines
    were still set in serifs, today at least every second one has switched to sans
    serif. So it wouldn't surprise me if the a new pilgrimage towards The New Typography
    would develop within the typography community in the close future -- almost a

    physical act of reading\u2014an easy, pleasurable one, to the extent that I can.\r\n\r\nIt
    is\u2014despite whatever \"adjustments\" the man made to some of his earlier holdings\u2014I
    think, only fair to credit Tschichold for that. It seems like common sense to
    me that I feel responsible to those two entities: author <em>and</em> reader.
    But I think \"Tschicholdian\" is not a knuckleheaded tribute to someone who was
    in the vanguard on that account before I was even born. "

    Can you back it up? Note: the 1st historical example I know of was 1938! If this
    is right, to me that is HUGE. Because I would say easily 50% of modern design

    in use?</em>\r\n\r\nA lot of the rhetoric of the time was future-oriented, talking
    about NT as the place where typography was GOING, not where it was. For example,
    doesn't Tschichold say that the sans-serif IDEA is most suited for the NT, but
    the currently existing sans-serif designs weren't quite there yet?"

    regarding sanserif type, was focused on the future. This was because the grotesks
    were still too human (one could see Tschichold as wanting Helvetica/Univers thirty
    years early) and because many printers still had no sanserif type in text sizes,
    and if they did, it was awful stuff. "

  body: "The Chinese have been hand-drawing and printing simple (or sometimes not
    so simple) motifs on their expensive letter sheets (mainly rice paper or silk)
    for one and a half *millennium* now. Called \"flower sheets\", they originated
    in the 5th century and become widespread in the 6th. When you write on such a
    sheet, you got text on top of graphics.\r\n\r\nBelow is an antique flower sheet
    featuring birds, here one is supposed to write around the motif:\r\n<img>http://www.cnartw.com/cweb/history/2001-06/hj2.jpg</img>\r\nI
    myself designed a set of flower sheets for members of my family a few years ago,
    using \"split corner motifs\" -- motifs that occupied the top right and bottom
    left corners, while both parts maintained a relation to each other. The series
    of motifs were all traditional Chinese inkbrush landscape, drawn by my farther
    specially for that purpose. I scanned the drawings, composited the pages in InDesign
    and printed them with BW laser printer on high-quality (commercial) watermarked
    sheets, which were then used for handwritten letters. I'd love to show one here,
    but I just can't find those files in my archive right now.\r\n\r\nHere is another
    exquisite antique example -- a rather excessive one (yes, that's really a \"blank
    sheet\"):\r\n<img>http://www.cnartw.com/cweb/history/2001-06/hj1.jpg</img>\r\nOne
    couldn't avoid writing over the drawing in this case now as it covers the whole
    sheet.\r\n\r\nNow, the kind of flower sheet that's commonly available nowadays:\r\n<img>http://www.ywsl.com/bookpic/upfile/20062173254292509.JPG</img>\r\nThis
    is a \"stamp booklet\", so the red stamps aren't an original part of the sheet,
    and the right-hand page has been left blank. Orchid and bamboo -- two of the most
    basic motifs of traditional Chinese drawing -- have long become the most common
    background themes for flower sheets.\r\n\r\nIn related matter, when did the Europeans
    start using graphically watermarked letter sheets? Were there ever watermark graphics
    that were somewhat complex and covered a significant portion of the sheet?\r\n"

    I can see that I am going to have to get the example to make the point I am trying
    to make. Of course you have had words & images in various ways in various cultures.
    Your points are good ones too. However, even beyond the media I am thinking of
    a very specific way of doing this ( I think so anyway ) which has stuck around
    & become the default mode in graphic design. So much so that when I do finally
    get this image I suspect 99% of us would say - 'so what?' that is until you see
    the date next to it. Anyway. ASAP I will post an image.\r\n\r\nBut in support
    of Neil's point, and to prefigure what I hope to show - I would have to say that
    the thoughtful and sensitive and resonant positioning of text in image that we
    see with Neil's image isn't standard in western layout until after Jan T. \r\n\r\nNick's
    example is great I think because it shows that the positioning is getting careful/deliberate
    at this point but it's also a bit forced compositionally speaking. What Dan is
    saying about grids may be going on too. I have to admit I am not 100% sure about
    that though."

    my point, actually. All of that Asian influence was on the painters of the era,
    to the woodblock printers, and slowly down the chain to the commercial graphic
    design.\r\n\r\nIt's the commercial graphic design and information systems that
    had the most profound changes, but the division between them and any Asian influence
    is vast.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Asian influence did affect the Germans and Swiss,
