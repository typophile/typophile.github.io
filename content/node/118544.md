  associate it with specific values or identity?\r\n \r\nI think it works, as in this

    people here."

  body: I think it's OK in decorative logos, but, yes, for <em>other</em> purposes,
    like alphabet reform, it would be lambda. Or some sound related to V.

    I just found an image that could be a good example \u2013 see below.\r\nBeautifully
    done. The modern high-contrast serif typeface goes very well with the overall
    ambience of the album cover (and the actual song).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_mm5kfpKdCa1r3fix8o1_1280_3580.jpg]"

  body: "I think if the crossbar is going to be removed it should be done for a valid
    reason, and not because the designer didn't have any better ideas. Victoria Beckham
    kind of skirts the line, but I guess it can be justified by the fact that the
    crossbar-less A at the the end of \"VICTORIA\" acts as an inversion of the initial
    V and sort of book-ends the name, creating a natural break with \"BECKHAM\". But
    perhaps I'm stretching.\r\n\r\nAs always, it depends on the particular execution
    and whether it's done well or badly."

    I think it''s well done. Not only was there a reason to remove the crossbars,
    the logo is used modestly, you only see it on the homepage. '

  body: "Occasionally a crossbarless _A_ might suggest that a word has ancient roots
    in Greek. But contemporary readers who recognize Greek letters are almost non
    existant.\r\nSo usually a word with a crossbarless _A_ suggests the opposite of
    ancient. Perhaps \"ad Astra\" the face of the future. \r\nIn any case, the crossbarless
    _A_ is  now such a design clich\xE9 that I would be reluctant to use it for anything
    that does not have an ultra sleek, high tech or futuristc character. Even there,
    it's in the \"been there, done that\" category.\r\nDon"
