  I've just finished my second year on my graphics course moving in the direction
  of exhibiton design along with information graphics. However my tutor suggested
  I use a programme to create 3D maps and layouts of areas for exhibitons, thing is
  I suggested CAD (I've never used it so I know I'm being quite dim but I know its
  used for 3D mapping) she suggested another programme but for the life of me I can't
  remember what it was. \r\n\r\nSo can any one suggest a programme that would be relevant
  to mapping space for a mac? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nBec x"

    unfortunately Adobe have discontinued it and built its features in Illustrator
    CS which I haven't used so much but is basically similar, if you are comfortable
    with Illustrator and don't want a completely \"lifelike\" rendering I would try
    it first.\r\nFor more full-on 3d software try Amapi, Bryce and Carrara which you
    can see here http://www.eovia.com/ but prepare yourself for a learning curve.\r\nEither
    way you will wish your computer was faster/more powerful.\r\nTim"
