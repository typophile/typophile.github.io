body: I've got a colleague who's trying to track down a typeface called <cite>Function</cite>.
  I haven't heard of it, but I'm told it's similar to <cite>Century Gothic</cite>.
  Does anyone know its origin?

    re-named 'borrowed' designs. Just a guess, but we have all seen these kinds of
    font packages.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: You're correct. It seems identical to Futura but with different sizes and
    kerning.

  body: "We never even saw a sample of the font, and accepted the poster's evaluation
    that it looked \"identical to\" Futura. How is it that you are so sure about the
    origin? Can you post a sample of \"Function\"?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
