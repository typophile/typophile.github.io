  into letters I'm starting to like the look of. Its pretty much my first sensible
  attempt at something usable, so am not up to speed on contrasting and detailing
  so would love to open the floor up to critique. \r\n\r\nAny feedback and thoughts
  are appreciated and hopefully with some guidance I could develop this into something
  quite pretty.\r\n\r\nThanks, I really appreciate the help from this level of expertise\r\n\r\nJordan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web_trim_1_5956.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web_trim_1_handgloves_3470.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'First impressions: I love the capital R and the g is very interesting too.
    Other than that, this face has potential, but there are some forms that you might
    want to study further so you can spot the "awkwardness," especially for for the
    forms of a, e, and s. Also, as this comes in time and experience, but you need
    to focus on not measuring the width of the letters, but the optical spacing, especially
    the negative space. Also, make sure that every form has a similar DNA to each
    other. Keep it up, and good luck!'

  body: 'Great job. I''m really impressed. I love the D and k. I agree with jlapiak,
    the s is a little awkward, along with the e- visually the hook seems to stop a
    little short. But I love where you''re going with it. '

  body: "Looks like good work. I actually think the s is fine; ordinarily one wouldn't
    want the center tangent to be fully horizontal but I think it works with this
    design. The e, however, is definitely awkward.\r\n\r\nX and x cross too low and
    appear top-heavy, especially in this high-crossbar face. They also seem a bit
    narrow."

  body: "Hey, I'm back from holiday and ready to tackle some curves again.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for all the feedback, some very useful points made which I have been working on
    to correct and smooth out...\r\n\r\nThe main problem seemed to be in the curves
    of the e a and s so I have given these some attention to give them a body that
    better fits with my o shape.\r\nI have also angled the center of the s which seems
    to work for me, but see what you think of the change.\r\nThe x shape has also
    been changed after picking up on the point cerulean made, and I feel it is much
    better related to the rest of the crossbar heights now.\r\n\r\nI have also made
    a couple of alternative versions of a g k which will help me when it comes to
    drawing italics in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you all for your help, I shall
    be starting full-time work as of tomorrow so this will have to become a moonlit
    project from now on, so your advice has maybe saved me a few sleepless hours.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web_trim_2_4941.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web_trim_2_exams_5427.jpg]"

  body: "Jordan,\r\n\r\nI have a few comments on this typeface; however, take these
    comment with a grain of salt. I am by no means a type-expert. Hopefully, more
    will come along.\r\n\r\nTo start, everything seems a little tight to me. If the
    spacing/kerning could be loosened, I think this would be much easier on the eyes
    (especially look at your kerning between \"de\" \"ef\" and \"no\"). Next, the
    x-height of the alternate to your normal 'k' seems higher than of every other
    glyph in the lowercase. I think the 'C' looks kind of wide, and the 'K' feels
    awkward.\r\n\r\nGood luck on the font, and I hope I'm not being too picky."

  body: "Thanks,\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned really that these are letters dragged
    from the design file so I haven't began on my spacing yet... but thanks for the
    attention to detail.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments, I had doubts about both the
    C and the K so I am glad someone mentioned them. I think that the leg of the K
    may begin too high up in relation to the uppercase crossbars so I shall have a
    look at both that and my C width.\r\n\r\n\r\nps. Your pickyness is why we are
    here!"

  body: "After playing around with the C and K for a while, the rest of the upper
    case really started to look bad to me. The O and related shapes felt far too wide
    for the rest of the typeface and stuck out when I tried putting the uppercase
    into words and sentences.\r\n\r\nI hit the beziers once more to give the whole
    upper case more of the feel that the lower case has, one that is altogether less
    condensed and open. This turns out to have made my K fit in once more (although
    I have a retouched one in case it still looks too misshapen) and give upper case
    words a more solid feel.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web_trim_3caps_5645.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web_trim_3capsname_5129.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    am also starting to think about expanding the weight of my letters into regular
    and bold (or perhaps down to a hairline??) but have yet to find any good resources
    for helping me do so... if anyone knows of any good sources I would love it if
    you could share them or direct me to a relevant discussion. Thanks.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again guys,\r\nJordan"

    the first thing that stuck out to me about this font. \r\n\r\nOh, and stick with
    the two-story a...something about the one-story one you posted just looked a bit
    awkward.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"
