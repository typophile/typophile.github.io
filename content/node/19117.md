body: 'Hello. Few years ago I designed a font (more than one in fact) in true type
  format and now I want to convert it to Type 1 and Open type. When I do the conversion
  I see that the font does not retain the quality of the original true type version.
  Is there a way to convert the font so the curves won''t be ''bumpy''? It ain''t
  very bad but this could be better. Thanks for the tips. Reg - I use FontLab 4.04  '

  body: "It's a tricky conversion. If the font is hinted, you will lose the hints
    entirely. You _can_ mathematically convert quadratic Beziers (TT) to cubics (Type1/CFF)
    without loss, but you have to make sure not to integer quantize the resulting
    coords, and you'll get about twice as many control points as strictly needed.
    I don't know much about FontLab, and whether they've improved their spline math
    in recent years, but I do know that FontForge can be coaxed into doing this conversion
    reasonably well [the conversion in the other direction, though, from T1 to TT,
    sucks, as does the \"simplify\" tool for trying to reduce the number of control
    points].\r\n\r\nBut why convert? TrueType outlines are even more native within
    OpenType than are Type1's. Type1 is fast becoming a legacy format, so unless there's
    a special need to support older systems, why not just release in OT with TT outlines?\r\n"

    format? Version 4.6 will do OTF-CFF (PS-flavored), but not proper OpenType-TT.
    I believe you'll need FLStudio5 for that.\r\n\r\nAfter converting quadratic B-splines
    (TT) to cubic Beziers (Type1) with FontLab \u2013 don't forget to reverse the
    contours accordingly \u2013, you could use FL's <strong>Optimize</strong> operation
    to remove the superfluous nodes/points. (In FL4.6 it's under Tools->Outline->Optimize)

  body: "Truetype is cross-platform so I can't see the advantage in conversion to
    T1. The only advantage is when saving to outlines in Illustrator for manipulation
    purposes, the T1 curves have fewer points.  Other than that, TT does a fine job
    all round and saves to opentype with no problem.\r\nMiguel, I think FL-4.6 can
    output to either opentype format. The wording used to describe it all in FL5 is
    better though.\r\nFOGs \"Clean up Paths\" does a better job of point reduction

    the dsig table is the singular element that determines whether this icon displays
    or not. For example: you could have a feature-rich TT-flavored OTF without a signature,
    which does not display the icon. or you could have a simple TT file with no special
    features that has been signed and DOES display the OT icon. I think this is all
    very silly and, obviously, confusing to users."

    Why don't the OS make the decision of changing the icon based upon the presence
    of font data other than the DSIG table? Microsoft's intelligent approach again?
