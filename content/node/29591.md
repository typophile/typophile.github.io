  on the history and significance in typographical history of Palatino, and just wanted
  to canvass for any opinions or points anyone here has? \r\n\r\nI'm particularly
  interested in its position as one of the most widely pirated faces today. Are there
  really any concrete differences between Palatino and Book Antiqua? Have there been
  any other quite so bravely derivative versions put out? Why copy it in the first
  place?\r\n\r\nAlso, my knowledge of the typographical timeline is very limited..
  but is Palatino vastly different different to other faces which were also being
  released in the late 40's/early 50's? Do you think the second World War played any
  part in its creation? (A point some books make is the Third Reich's allegiance to
  blackletter shifting to roman faces having derided blackletter as a Jewish deceit..)\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas or discussion greatly appreciated!"

  body: "Maybe not something you would include, but to me the most significant thing
    about Palatino is that it's essentially a display face but mostly it's used for
    text. The fact that it actually has a texty companion designed by Zapf (Aldus)
    seems not to matter...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
