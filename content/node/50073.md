body: I'm not on my own machine any more, but would like to customize a new keyboard
  to work as close as possible to my regular FLS5 Win workflow. I'm missing a single
  key option for the Quick preview. On my laptop i can just press ~ and the outline
  is filled in and everything else in the glyph goes away (different from the preview
  control+p). I know how to customize key commands, but i can't seem to find what
  this function is called in the customize window. Can anyone help me?

  body: actually, it might be the acute key and not the ~... but you get the idea.

    for the fast preview will either be [ : ] or [ " ] key(on Windows). And If this
    doesn''t work, try pressing some keys next to the "Enter" key, it was somewhere
    there, :-).'
