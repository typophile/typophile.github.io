		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Kristian</p>
<p>The last time I did this - adapting two &lsquo;bespoke&rsquo; typefaces for a London studio in the early 1990s - the entire job was charged out at my hourly rate. The completion of the job was the sign-off point at which the studio director was satisfied that the resulting fonts were adequate for the studio&rsquo;s purposes. I recall that the whole project took about three weeks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not sure that this scenario would apply to today&rsquo;s practice for font production; for a couple of things, the software is smarter and chargeable man-hours are cheaper. Many other people on typophile may have better or more up-to-the-minute advice on this.</p>
<p>If you believe that there will be a significant difference between the time/price you estimate and what you will eventually bill for payment, it would be wise to sit down with the client and agree a &lsquo;ballpark&rsquo; figure, i.e. the maximum possible invoice amount. This needs to be itemised against the deliverables on the project - in this case, three weights of (the roman only?) the new typeface.</p>
<p>As you don&rsquo;t yet know the full complexity of the project, extras like italics, small caps, screen-optimised fonts, condensed styles, extra weights, custom characters, ligatures, alternate numerals etc. etc. may get added onto the project, for which you should be able to charge &lsquo;pro rata&rsquo; in other words, at your going rate.</p>
<p>Most designers I know now insist on scheduled installments on a project - both for supply of the deliverables and payments. Setting all this out in advance should help you and your client come to a detailed understanding of what will be involved.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you are designing the three fonts from scratch figure out how much time it will take and what your hourly rate is. A discussion here a year or so ago covered some of this.</p>
<p>If you figure the average typeface can take 3 or 4 weeks working full time, what does that come out to, based on your hourly rate. (and please figure on a real hourly rate, one that it would take to run your business, not some figure you would be happy to get pushing pixels on someone else&rsquo;s workstation, in someone else&rsquo;s studio)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for the first font, now you have two more. If you haven&rsquo;t done this sort of work before I think it will take you longer than these time estimates.</p>
<p>What are the licensing issues? Will the client own exclusive rights to the work, or will you be able to offer it to others?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sell this work cheap. It takes a lot of time to create a quality font.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James is right; better not to underprice this project. Of course he points out that working from scratch, and possibly for the first time, on this will be very time-consuming and labour-intensive.</p>
<p>Kristian, your initial post makes it sound like the character shapes for this new typeface are already decided, and you will be responsible for generating three weights of the roman.</p>
<p>I should add that this is more-or-less what happened in that 90s project I mentioned – and I&rsquo;ve edited my earlier post to explain this better. I generated just the regular weight of the romans (no italics! no extra characters!) from two designs that already existed as rubylith masters; both of them were bastardised forms of typefaces better known by other names. There is no way I could have generated the characters from scratch within that timeframe.</p>
<p>At a rough guess, the three weeks work at that rate was about £6 – 7k. This means that the commissioning studio had budgeted more than £3k per font; although that might sound expensive, I recall that they planned to leverage much more value of work out of these particular typefaces after the project was completed, so for them it appeared as a reasonable investment.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound expensive at all. Maybe for the early 90s but certainly not now.</p>
