body: Hello, I am fairly new to typography and I've really developed a liking to it.
  From reading these forums and others I have gained a new appreciation for letter
  forms. Now I cannot help but bring that knowledge when I produce documents. I would
  like to see some samples of beautiful typesetting and document formatting from which
  I can learn and see as an example. Something along the lines of the Feltron Annual
  Report, would be a good reference.

    strikes me as a nice example of what can be done with Minion, Myriad, and some
    colour splatted around.\r\n\r\n(Its contents are interesting too, if you're into
    this kind of stuff.)"

  body: "The boundary between design and typesetting is somewhat arbitrary. I like
    to think of the two as a continuum, though there is a reasonably clear demarcation.
    In addition to all the other elements the designer must handle well, if the designer
    doesn't also anticipate the difficulties the compositor will face, the piece will
    not succeed very well. In the same vein, the designer cannot specify every detail,
    the compositor has to understand the design, and his/her work has to compliment
    it. \r\n\r\nIf that's anywhere near right, you will not get \"beautiful\" composition
    (typesetting) without equally good design. The inverse is also true.\r\n\r\nThe
    second point is that what is beautifully done according to one audience -- e.g.,
    those who look at annual reports -- may fall flat when viewed by a different audience
    -- say, those who enjoy classically made books.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
