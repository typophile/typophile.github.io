  on the main \r\nlogo mark but im now need to add the subtext. The company is called
  ABK styling, it's basically a body kit's company.  I've been looking thru many fonts
  but i can't seem to find one that fits my mark. Here's the logo in it's current
  state- \"styling\" will go either to the lower right corner, spread across the bottom,
  or overlap from the bottom right. My boss wants me to experiment with as many fonts
  as possible so i could use as many font suggestions as possible.\r\n\r\n"

    mark type.\r\nI thought immediately of the Reebok(RBK) logo, but so what. <rbk.com>\r\n\r\nI'm
    guessing you have drawn the type yourself, and think before you go much further
    you need to address the aesthetic a bit. The left side of the 'A' looks really
    heavy compared to the 'B' and 'K' also the bottom curve on the 'B' looks a fraction
    disjointed from the rest of the character. \r\nI think 'white' spaces are just
    as impostant as the 'black' marks, they need to relate to each other, this is
    seen in the horizontal white space you have created and the difference in space
    you have between each letter. In a similar way curves also often look better when
    they are consistant with each other.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I think you will naturally
    find your search for a subtext font an easier process."
