body: Over the years my font collection have seamed to grow quite large. This is good....&#40;I
  guess&#41;. But since I cannot remember what they all look like, it is becomming
  a problem for me to choose the appropiate one for a given job &#40;since there are
  so many&#41;. <BR>All my fonts &#40;not the ones the came with windows XP&#41; recides
  in &#34;/program files/common files/adobe/fonts&#34;. This means whenever I open
  a design program, eg. Illustrator, the font list is very large and there are no
  subdirectories for each font. <BR>I am simply loosing track of my fonts.... <BR>A
  solution would be to catogorize the fonts, I think. <BR>What do you guys do to prevent
  this problem? <BR>Is there an international type classification that all the pros
  use?  <BR> <BR>/Thomas

    <BR> <BR>And perhaps Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft should stop cluttering up people&#39;s
    font menus with gobs of fonts they don&#39;t need and didn&#39;t ask for. &#34;Font
    Spam&#34;, as Gerald so aptly termed it. <BR> <BR>One thing I&#39;ve done is simply
    to empty out the file Library&#62;Application Support&#62;Adobe&#62;Fonts &#40;or
    XP equivalent&#41;. That helps quite a lot.'

  body: If you used a font management to activate and deactivate your fonts this wouldn&#39;t
    be a problem. I actually keep my fonts organized by foundry. I also find that
    after you load the fonts and quickly dig through them it is easy enough to remove
    the ones which really probably won&#39;t ever serve any sort of purpose. I also
    use FontBook to make PDFs of the various folders which I know I won&#39;t use
    that often.
