  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m currently working on a small project for 2 Navy programs&hellip; WRAPS (Waste Reduction Afloat Protects the Sea) and PRIME (Plastic Removal in the Marine Environment). They&rsquo;re both preventative programs to lessen the impact of harmful pollutants that are leached into the oceans from naval ships.</p>
<p>WRAPS has created recycling programs that limit the levels of caustic waste while a ship is deployed. Usually the final waste is mostly biological (food remnants) that get processed into small pucks.</p>
<p>PRIME is another recycling program that focuses directly on any and all plastic products that are used on deployed naval ships.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hoping to expand the impact of their programs on a more broad sector, and possibly even breach into the commercial shipping companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked to create some marketing material. We&rsquo;re starting small. I&rsquo;ve created some simplified logos and have been asked to come up with tag lines and other collateral. I&rsquo;m kinda stuck on ideas and was wondering if anyone might have a thought or two they&rsquo;d like to share.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post what I currently have as far as the proposed logos, that will probably be used on the marketing swag they&rsquo;ll hand out at trade shows and stuff. At the very bottom of the PDF are the original logos (circular ones.) and approved colors I can use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also in charge of making a pocket folder and handouts. An idea I had was to create an ocean scene, either from scratch or use a photograph, and then place silhouetted images of fish and underwater wildlife, to signify the lose of these creature if pollution prevention measures aren&rsquo;t taken further.</p>
<p>My creativity bone is broken and I could use some fresh ideas.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is for the Navy? If so, you&rsquo;re WAY off base. Didn&rsquo;t you read US Logo Specifications section 28 paragraph 3 clauses 1 - 4?</p>
<ol>
<li>All logos must be round. Like a seal. It looks important.</li>
<li>All logos must incorporate at least 7 unique literal objects into the mark.</li>
<li>Issues of reproduction should be ignored. We know we can&rsquo;t realistically put these behemoths on a banner on a web site, but we don&rsquo;t care. We&rsquo;re the government.</li>
<li>Make sure it uses at least 9 colors. We like color.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I have no other advice than to start over. These are simply way too nice for government logos.</p>

<p>Lucky for me, I&rsquo;ve been able to come up with stuff outside of the &ldquo;US Logo Specs&rdquo; guidelines because most of our projects are trying to pick up outside consultants and possible commercial users. I don&rsquo;t even know if I could design a ridge circular logo if asked.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The programs run simultaneously together and the client asked for the name grouping. However, the tag line can be separate that&rsquo;s not much of an issue.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m really having difficulty with is coming up with a visual theme that works well to promote both the beauty of the oceans and the impact of these environmentally friendly programs. My client wants lots of color, so I thought of exploring the beauty of the sea and all the brightly colored wildlife. I&rsquo;m having trouble finding decent images too.</p>
<p>The ideas should just start flowing, but I&rsquo;ve been stuck on this for a while now and my client would like to see some things soon.</p>

<p>If you really want some ideas, try flipping through some National Geographic underwater stuff. Today I went to their annual photography contest exhibition, and some of those photos just blew my mind—I&rsquo;ll be pulling material from it all semester, and if they did a book for it I&rsquo;d be doing so for a good decade.</p>
