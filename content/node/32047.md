body: "New York has produced its own city-branded condom, using packaging graphics
  lifted from Vignelli's subway signage system. Oddly, the color palette is wrong,
  which any New Yorker would easily recognize, but the designer seems to be going
  for visual punch rather than accuracy. They're giving these away for free by the
  truckload in NY, and tourists seem to be eating them up (so to speak). I think this
  is an interesting situation of using design to make a potentially embarrassing item
  \"fun.\" Take a look at the design:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.designdrivethru.net"

  body: One of my first freelance projects was promotional materials for a movie,
    Party Girl. They had a condom as one of their promotions. I couldn't quite bring
    myself to put my condom wrapper design into my portfolio but I still have it.
    I'm sure the condom is quite brittle by now.

  body: I think that is a really nice idea, shame about the palette as these little
    details always bolster a concept. I might actually include this piece in my dissertation.

  body: "Posey is a bit of a wack job. At least then I think she might have been a
    junkie. She acted VERY high strung and kept rubbing my arm, like she was trying
    to give me an Indian burn. \r\n\r\nShe was hilarious in Best in Show tho."

    amazing acting - on the part of Posey (no surprise) but also pretty much\r\neverybody
    else - and Jennifer Coolidge was on another planet. Thank you!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
