  body: The general style of this typeface is indeed quite typical -- the Bauhaus
    geometric sans -- but I think this is either customised (or custom designed).

  body: "It's possible that someone used a typeface for the \"ocean club\" logo, but
    the constructs are so easy to draw. (They are actually simplified parallel and
    concentric outlines, not what most typefaces are about.)\r\n\r\nEssentially only
    three character -- o, e and n.\r\nThe c just is cut from the o.\r\nThe e was flipped
    and rotated for the a and b.\r\nThe n was flip for the u, and bisected to create
    the l.\r\n\r\n"
