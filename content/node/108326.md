body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nRunning into a strange issue on a font I am working on for a client.
  Created fractions, and the 1/8 fraction will not show up in the glyph palette in
  Illustrator, but will show up in InDesign (all other fractions I created show up
  properly). Is this an Adobe/AI/INDD issue or am I doing something wrong in FLS?
  \r\n\r\nAlso, the \"notequal\" glyph shows up incorrectly in AI (showing up as a
  glyph that I didn't create), but shows up as the proper glyph in INDD (see attached
  image- correct glyph is the top image). \r\n\r\nAnyone run into this, and have a
  fix/solution? \r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/notequal_INDD_AI_6465.jpg]"

    or something else? Thanks. '

  body: "When you say it shows up in InDesign can you pick it out of the glyph pallet?
    If you can, does it flash-up the correct Unicode for the 1/8 fraction. Can you
    repeat that in the Illustrator glyph pallet? Can you generate the outline from
    the 1/8 glyph?\r\n\r\nDid you do the amends in FontLab? Do you get the correct
    Unicode for 1/8 if you read the finished font back into FontLab?\r\n\r\nCheck
    the outlines for 1/8, do you have doubled-up outlines?"

  body: "I would say this is a bug in Illustrator \u0421\u0421. I have version 17.0.2.
    I have tested this issue with several installed fonts and Illustrator doesn't
    show totally 2 glyphs: .notdef glyph (which is usually the first glyph in the
    font) and the last glyph of the font. Adding one glyph to the font in FLS fixes
    the problem for the previous glyph but the new added glyph is invisible in the
    Glyphs panel.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"

  body: 'Thanks johnych- I emailed both FLS and Adobe and seems that Adobe AI CC has
    a bug. Hopefully Adobe fixes this b/c it''s pretty annoying! I have been working
    around it by adding in a "dummy" glyph at the very end but wonder when I can stop
    doing this. Thanks! '
