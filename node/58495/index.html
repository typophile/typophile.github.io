  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm bracing to tackle a redesign of my (fairly small ~2000) school's newspaper. I've been looking around at potential typefaces, and thought I'd throw the question out to a more experienced crowd.
I'm hoping to pull some bold moves with the paper's look and layout, and I don't anticipate anyone being upset if I break tradition. I'm generally disappointed with what I've found to be a low readership at school, and while I realize it might not be my place as art director to pretend that I can make the paper "better," I'm hoping that I can inject some new life into the vision and scope of the publication. Especially before it goes the way of other college papers—poorly organized websites and blogs.

Admittedly, I am an HFJ addict, and should probably broaden my vision, if only for budgetary reasons.
Right now I'm loving their:

Chronicle Display Compressed Black Italic (and the other displays)
(http://www.typography.com/images/productLineImages/chrondispcomp_black_i.gif)

Gosh I'm such a sucker, but I even love their suggested combo with Knockout. Ha.
(http://www.typography.com/images/suggestionImages/chrontext-knockout.png)

Maybe before I list off other potentially unrealistic choices, I should open it up more generally...

Are there choices I should stay away from?

 I like to think I can have fun with this. This is a paper that is freely distributed. It doesn't rely on single issue sales. The content is not vast, and so I think I can be fairly luxurious with the layout. To me it sounds like a great opportunity (and probably a rare one) to have a lot of fun visually.
Any suggestions? Any interesting typefaces that won't break the bank?
As far as text faces go, I realize that newspaper text faces are a science unto themselves, but if you have any solid recommendations that might border on edgy (??), that would be cool.

Also—don't laugh—would HFJ's Acropolis Black Italic be too crazy ???
I'm brand new to the newspaper game, and I'm discovering it's another breed of editorial design. They don't mess around. Ha

Thanks,

Luke</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just a really quick idea / suggestion. 

Maybe for an experiment, i have no idea if it's a good match. But personally if had the chance i would try print af few test spreads with Fred Smeijers's Arnhem typeface and maybe together with Fago or DTL Argo. 

Might be too must magazine in looks and feel. But hey, just an idea. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was going to suggest Arnhem, but I see someone beat me to it. Arnhem is a very nice newspaper type, or text typeface for that matter. A fairly recent [[http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=226|redesign]] of the Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad uses it very succesfully.</div>

http://www.ted.com/talks/jacek_utko_asks_can_design_save_the_newspaper.html

Inspiring and hopefully you'll find something to propel your art direction. :)

Take a look at <b>Galaxie Copernicus</b> (http://www.vllg.com/Village/GalaxieCopernicus/mudTyper+Weights/) from <b>Village</b> (http://www.vllg.com/).  Make sure to download the PDF on the left to check out how it looks in a variety of cases.

I love Copernicus! That specimen is definitely saved and the page bookmarked.
Swift is great too of course.
I'll just throw this out there as an additional question—
does anyone know how fluorescent ink (or even white ink) works on newsprint?</div>
