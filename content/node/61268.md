  body: "I have redesigned each and every element of \"Beat the Whites with the Red
    Wedge\" as characters in a typeface by the same name. As I have seen all lettering
    has been handrawn, and have based on a San Serif typeface. \r\nIt should be easy
    to find out which one by looking through typefaces designed before 1919 with a
    similar \"M\" [ in \u043A\u043B\u0438\u043D\u043E\u043C ]and \"C\" [ in \u043A\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043D\u044B\u0445
    ] that were in use around 1919. One should take into account the fact that while
    being handrawn the letterforms were either condensed or based on a condensed weight
    of the typeface in question. The closest typefaces that are similar are ITC Johnston
    (1916) and Gill Condensed (1928-32), also Erbar (1922).\r\n"
