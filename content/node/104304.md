  substitutions for regional indicator symbol pairs, but am not sure if that sort
  of thing would technically be called a ligature or what.

    considered "authoritative", so I don't get incorrect information because I used
    less-than-ideal search terms and blindly followed Google.

    say fortunately. Too many type designers are apt to think, \"oh, this <strong>should</strong>
    be this way, I'll make it required.\" rlig should be used when the alphabet (script)
    itself requires the ligature, not otherwise.\r\n\r\nTake the fi ligature for one
    example. And suppose you do have a swoopy \"f\", which collides with the tittle
    of the i, so you make fi and ffi required ligatures.\r\n\r\nAnd I have an old-school
    customer who insists that ligatures should not be used with a setting size greater
    than 18-point. Or, while you don't claim to support Turkish, someone selects your
    typeface for a text that contains some Turkish words, a few of which are spelled
    with a dotted i following an f...\r\n\r\nNow of course any comp worth her salt
    can achieve this even if you've used rlig, but it's handwork they shouldn't have
    to go through. Be real careful with rlig assigments, indeed, with anything that
    substitutes your judgement for an editors or experienced compositors judgement.\r\n\r\nIf
    this gives you more time on your hands, make up a separate set of number glyphs
    for setting proportions versus tabular figures. Make the 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 fit
    that *required* common body..."

  body: "I see your point, but the example you're using seems to be one of a poor
    implementation rather than a problem with the available features.\r\n\r\nThe case
    where the absence of 'rlig' implementation created problems for me was a slightly
    different one. I was working on a design which contained a large number of ligated
    forms which were implemented using contextual forms of each letter rather than
    preformed ligature glyphs. This was done to allow accented characters to occur
    in ligatures, and to allow ligated sequences of more than three characters without
    creating a huge number of precomposed forms.\r\n\r\nThe contextual substitutions
    were still triggered by 'liga' (in some cases) and 'dlig' (in others) rather than
    'calt' since these forms performed the function of ligatures and 'calt' already
    included a variety of substitutions which served a very different function.\r\n\r\nEach
    type of ligation required two substitutions of the following form:\r\n\r\n1. sub
    @class1' @class2 by @class1joined;\r\n2. sub @class1joined @class2' by class2joined;\r\n\r\nThe
    following problem arose:\r\n\r\nIf, in a sequence such as XYZ, where ligation
    was possible between all three characters, but the user only wanted to ligate
    X and Y, Y would still end up appearing in the form appropriate for joining to
    Z, but Z would not change accordingly and the results would be not only awful,
    but entirely illegible.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, the first substitution was performed
    by 'dlig' and the second by 'rlig', which still gives the user full control over
    whether to ligate or not, but avoids issues at feature boundaries. Unfortunately,
    I did most of my initial testing in InDesign (where this works) before I discovered
    that programs like photoshop don't implement 'rlig'.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me there
    should be at least one feature available which has an 'always on' status which
    is available for <em>every</em> script, and at the moment rlig is the only registered
    feature which even remotely fit the bill in the above example.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
