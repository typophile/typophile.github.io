  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As an old-school-trained typo (ie: pencils and character counting, definitely a dead art) I sometimes struggle with applications like Flash, which seem never intended to natively support what I consider to be basic typographic considerations such as ligatures.</p>
<p>Using my Mac, I can easily type Option-Shift-5 for an &lsquo;fi&rsquo; lig and Option-Shift-6 for an &lsquo;fl&rsquo;, but what do I do when I want more ligatures?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m specifically after an &lsquo;ffi&rsquo; lig, which I don&rsquo;t know the key combination for. But how would I determine the key combos for this, or for an &lsquo;ffl&rsquo; - especially when I have an expert set available?</p>
<p>Is there an app or utility which would look at the font and tell me what key combo to use? I seem to remember something that did this under Mac System 7, 8 and 9 (showing my age now, lol), but can&rsquo;t find anything similar for OSX.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this final bit of info is relevant or not, but it&rsquo;s an Open Type font I&rsquo;m using - a well-crafted one too, so I&rsquo;m sure the ligatures will be present.</p>
<p>Please help me find them!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In old Postscript fonts, these ligatures, when provided, would have been accessible via the keyboard because they would have been put in place of other characters (rather than having a place of their own). So, for instance, typing a W would yield the ffi character in an old Adobe expert set. Other foundries had/have different standards. (For instance, H&amp;FJ and Font Bureau would put ffi in the ∞ position in their regular fonts.)</p>
<p>In an Opentype font, however, ff-ligatures have their own unique place, but cannot be accessed via the keyboard. They must be deployed via OpenType layout features (specifically the {liga} feature). Or they may be manually inserted, if the application offers a method to do this (such as the glyph palette in Adobe applications).</p>
<p>If your application provides neither of these, then you may be out of luck.</p>

<p>SmartyPants software contextually substitutes single and double &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; quotes by curly quotes, however:</p>
<p>All single quotes are treated as &ldquo;right&rdquo; quotes &ndash; this allows the apostrophe for abbreviation to work correctly.
So you have to adopt the North American style of using double quote marks for primary quotations, to make the system work correctly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Many thanks for the above replies, it&rsquo;s great to have so much expert help available.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask one more question regarding kentlew&rsquo;s post above :</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an Opentype font, however, ff-ligatures have their own unique place, but cannot be accessed via the keyboard. They must be deployed via OpenType layout features (specifically the {liga} feature). Or they may be manually inserted, if the application offers a method to do this (such as the glyph palette in Adobe applications).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please can you explain the {liga} feature you mention? I think I broadly understand what you mean, but in an application like Flash (where I have my specific problem), apart from using key combinations, how would I deploy the ligatures I need?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m basically asking how do I find the characters I require?</p>

In order for a user like yourself to take advantage of these features, an application needs to provide support for them.</p>
<p>There are specifications for certain features to be activated by default; others are discretionary, to be applied on an ad hoc basis. The application needs to be written to implement these kinds of OT layout features and then provide an interface for the user to activate or deactivate them.</p>
<p>Apparently Flash does not do so yet.</p>
<p>Levels of support for OpenType layout features vary widely between applications still, and this whole arena is still in a state of flux.</p>
