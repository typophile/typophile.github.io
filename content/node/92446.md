body: "Designing a typeface requires too much technical information and efforts which
  are barriers to the designer. The interface of most type design programs are created
  with a mind which is more a \"Developer/Programmer\" mind rather than a \"Designer\"
  mind. This made the learning of these programs much harder for designers. I've worked
  with some complex CG programs like \"Maya\" but I found their interface much more
  satisfying and easier to achieve project goals. So I was thinking about how a Type
  design program should be and came up with an \"Imaginary Program\". Maybe my Idea
  is idealistic and too far from what we could have in near future but I thought some
  Ideas might be interesting for you and/or program developers. I had to get it out,
  so here is the idea: \r\n\r\nThe Imaginary program has a general window named \"Text
  Editor\" and couple of secondary windows which will appear in middle of design process.
  in the Text editor The software puts a predefined text that will be used for examining
  the typeface and creating glyphs and other stuff (we could have three text models:
  \"Basic\" which only includes a couple of glyphs which are required for designing
  the basic Idea e.g. humburgefonts and \"Advanced\" text which contains all glyphs
  of the language(s) in actual words and \"Extended\" text which contains all possible
  combinations which are required for the language. I think this should be the main
  window when a designer works with a typeface (instead of glyphs list window which
  is now the main window when we open a font). There are some reasons for this argument:
  1. I (as a designer) wouldn't be interested in glyph names and encoding and digitally
  related information behind glyphs and so many other technicalities. I just want
  to design letters (or glyphs) and examine them in the intended context 2. I could
  create complex OpenType lookups in the context without any knowledge of programming
  (I'll explain it later) 3. I always wanted to design in words not just individual
  glyphs. In this window I could simultaneously design a glyph and watch it in the
  combinations and full body text. I can edit and redesign glyphs and examine them
  interactively. (The \"Glyphs\" program has implemented similar kind of behavior
  but the text window is restricted; we can't have lines of text, there is no predefined
  text there and your text shouldn't be too long. so you can't test too many combinations)
  4. When I want to find a glyph I just have to type it in the \"find\" window dialogue,
  no more crappy names for glyphs to find them or other issues. So the basic Idea
  is to replace the glyph list with a sophisticated text editor window as a main window
  to find and organize glyphs and justify text and everything. Glyphs list window
  will not be vanished and it would be in background, and every time I want to go
  in depth I'll call it.  \r\n\r\nEverything is incorporated in the \"Text Editor\"
  window. But it's not packed. We could have the \"Text Editor\" as the main window
  and some buttons that would be used for creating ligatures and other sophisticated
  OpenType typographic features. We still have the toolbar and other path related
  operations like merge counters and whatsoever. When I open the program, it would
  ask me in which language(s) I want to design. I click the language and hit next,
  then it asks which template I want e.g. Nastaliq (or Cursive hand writing in Latin)
  or Naskh (or Roman typical typeface in Latin) and so on.When I open the template
  I see the \"Basic\" text with basic elementary components in grey color (they could
  be in the mask). Name of these components are simple and human readable. In first
  step I only design these elementary components and in the final process the software
  adds the final glyphs with their production names. These templates could be expanded
  or edited later by users and shared on the net. I also thought that there would
  be a guideline for users in order to develop such smart templates, which will be
  used to automatically creating a whole bunch of glyphs.\r\n\r\n. In the Text Editor
  I could define and design ligatures. I highlight the glyphs which I want to be replaced,
  then I hit \"create ligature\" button. A window will appear and I design the ligature.
  There is an ok and cancel button on the window, cancel will override the works and
  ok will automatically create the required OpenType lookup for the ligature .In the
  Text Editor I could create contextual alternatives. basically I click on the glyph(s)
  that I want to be replaced; then I click \"create contextual alternative\" button,
  then I highlight the context, and finally I hit enter to proceed or escape to cancel;
  subsequently contextual alternatives window would come up. In the window we see
  a grey representation of the surrounding glyphs and the base glyph in the middle,
  now I can redesign the middle glyph to suit it to the situation. If I want to change
  the context I highlight it in the Text Editor. There is an ok and cancel button
  on the window, cancel will override the works and ok will automatically create required
  OpenType lookup for the contextual lookup.In the Text Editor I could define connections
  between glyphs in cursive typefaces (like cursive handwriting or Arabic script).
  There is a \"Basic\" text which contains all possible combinations of the components.
  I click two unconnected parts and click \"create cursive connection\" button, and
  a window will appear; in the cursive connection window we see a grey representation
  of the two unconnected parts, so I only have to position the parts (if I have to)
  and design the connection between the parts. The software will automatically generate
  the required rule in OpenType language. This will be done in a contextual alternatives
  and a cursive attachment lookup. There is an ok and cancel button on the window,
  cancel will override the works and ok will automatically create required OpenType
  lookups .In The Text Editor I could define spacing. I have the \"Extended\" text
  for every possible combination. So software is able to auto kern the text. Finally
  I have to examine the text and tune it up a little. If software generates every
  possible combinations based on the elementary components then the generated text
  might be much smaller than the actual final glyphs.\r\n\r\nOk here comes the too
  idealistic part!\r\nBase on the components the software creates the final glyphs
  for the intended languages (what Decotype does now for the tasmeem Arabic templates).
  The software will also expand contextual and ligature lookups to the new created
  glyphs and also creates class-kerning for the new glyphs. Mark positioning for placing
  the dots (in Arabic) and diacritics (if required) are also auto generated. All of
  these auto generated stuff are editable by hand (I don't know if the last part is
  achievable in tasmeem before shipping the font, Thomas would you please help on
  this?) .In the Text Editor, I could run a command which will examine the text in
  the intended languages (by using the \"Advance\" or \"Extended\" text) and it will
  mark the collided glyphs in the window. The software would examine the mark positioning
  and kerning data. I can click next or previous button to jump to any collision.
  The program could have a button like \"fix kerning collisions\" and it will create
  kerning exceptions, and \"fix mark positioning\" button would create contextual
  mark positioning lookups. \r\nIf there is anything left it should be handled manually.There
  is a script editor which echoes all the commands which are executing. So it's much
  easier to create scripts because I can find any command I want just by clicking
  a button or by doing it manually.\r\n\r\nMaybe some of the ideas already exist in
  some font programs but in a different implementation which I'm not aware of. If
  there is anything, please mention it. Also there are so many other things I didn't
  discuss because I think they already exist in the present programs.\r\nI bet there
  are other features which you always wanted to be in a program. I didn't say anything
  about Multiple Master, because I thought with Superpolator there isn't anything
  left.\r\n"

  body: "<cite>@nick: Drawing, Scaling and Transform tools that make sense would be
    nice, too.</cite>\r\nexactly, for example when rotating or scaling, handles are
    not easy to manipulate. I even haven't find a program that gives a flexibility
    to change the pivot point of scaling. but I love the splines in postscript curves.
    with keyboard and the trackpad I could get what I want very easy and fast (only
    in fontlab, I can't work with the others!). when cutting and attaching counters
    you have to do some inconvenient tasks. they could be easier."

  body: "Hi Bahman, \r\n\r\nDid you inspect our templates? They cover global mark
    positioning, followed by an optional round of manual tuning. If you then work
    with the font in Tasmeem, you will see that while our font layout engine avoids
    collisions intelligently. Kerning we do away with, that's a leftover from metal
    typesetting.\r\n\r\nHopefully that helps.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nt\r\n"

    interested to understand how your engine (ACE) and the Tasmeem software works.
    that's a brilliant thing about mark positioning and I'll look into it.\r\nregards,\r\nBahman"
