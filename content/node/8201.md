  body: 'To be able to do alternates you need to learn about OpenType. I started with

  body: My original idea was to not worry too much about making a good type face and
    instead to develop a solid understanding of mechanics of font development. Now
    I&#39;m somewhat intimidated by the amount of stuff I need to learn. Also, any
    critique on my handwriting font as a font?

  body: Noah, handwriting fonts can be a fun project to start learning about font-making
    but unless your handwriting is exceptional, it rarely makes an interesting font.
    There are already loads of fonts like this readily available, but maybe there
    is some demand for one with contextual alternates &#40;but i wouldn&#39;t bank
    on it!&#41; If you like this project, keep at it, but I&#39;m not sure anyone
    will appreciate it quite as much as you will.
