  body: There have been a few threads mentioning this already. I could not find the
    one I was thinking of, which did not shed much light on it anyway, but I managed
    to find a Typophile article called [[Monotype's SkyFonts Service Enables Font
    Rentals]] but I cannot figure out if it is a news posting or a blog entry.

  body: how in the world can they limit the use of fonts to five minutes?  Unless
    you have to use some kind of online app to design anything with (meaning you won't
    be allowed to download the font and install it on your system to use in your software
    program of choice).

    that a technical questions or are questioning the time frame?\r\nThe software
    you need to install pulls the fonts from a web server and installs them temporarily
    on your systems. When the time is up, they are removed again. "

    full of holes.</cite>\r\n\r\nI doubt that. \r\nI am not sure for which \u201Cside\u201D
    you are arguing. For 20 years font users complain that they have to pay the full
    font license, before getting the chance to try the font in their design apps on
    their machines. \r\nSkyfonts makes a lot of sense in this regard. Try the fonts
    free of charge, present different options to your clients. And it's also great
    for something like recreating a logo with 5 letters, which you have just got as
    JPG image from the client. Now you just pay for 1 day to use that font and you
    don't have to buy the full license. \r\nI find that much more convincing than
    Fontslice \u2013\_especially, since Monotype has almost all the fonts the users
    really want to use. "
