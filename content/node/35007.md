  film is now available to view online at the [[http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/11808/|Apple
  Trailers]] site today.\r\n\r\nI'm curious to know if anyone recognizes the type
  used in the credits at the end of the teaser. Many thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11808_type_5627.gif]\r\n\r\nVery
  nice and clean, whatever it is!\r\n\r\n-Joe"
