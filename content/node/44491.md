  a text font family that:\r\n\u2013 is warm and informal, yet, authoritative\r\n\u2013
  comes in a variety of weights\r\n\u2013 tracks well and holds together when justified\r\n\u2013
  has italics that are attractive or, at least, not ugly...;)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free
  to recommend a complementary sans serif font, as well.\r\n\r\nTHANKS!"

    more of what you like (or don't like) to meet this requirement.\r\n\r\nMy favorite
    sans/serif suites:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=freight\">Freight

  body: "We use the Freight family for one of our titles. \r\n\r\nThe sans family
    needs one more weight...the difference between the medium and bold is too great...and
    the lighter weight versions don't read well at first galnce...but I def like the
    bold/extra bold...and the overall look of the font\r\n\r\nLooking at Meta text...and
    will check out Fresco...\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions!"

    Our Type.\r\n\r\nHouse Beautiful magazine uses these, and the italics look quite
    nice.\r\n\r\nDavid"
