    which on this side of the Atlantic at least is having a bit of a revival lately.
    Square 721 I think is the same font published by Bitstream.\r\n\r\nIn case you\u2019ll
    find it useful it\u2019s <em>serifs</em>, not <em>serif\u2019s</em> \u2014 just
    a plural so no apostrophe needed."

    we would need some background: intended usage, weight/style needs, \u201Cfeeling\u201D,
    etc."
