body: "Hi, Basically I'm designing the advertising for a new jazz venue to be placed
  on the outside of a double decker tram.\r\n\r\nThe client has supplied the logo
  (Monotype Corsiva) and their accompanying typeface is Gill Sans Std Condensed. They
  have requested this to be used in the design. They requested the layout aswell.
  The want to portray a classy image to the audience but Im struggling with their
  preference of typeface. Im currently working on a rough draft (Colour Scheme Red,
  Silver Black). They have also requested the background of the tram be fully star
  lit. I have attached a jpeg of where I am up to. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions on accompanying
  typefaces or criticism welcome. I'm just not getting far with the feeling or representing
  class thoughout the design. Obviously I can change things and present them to them\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n"

    typefaces. \r\n\r\nYou've got a tough challenge because the windows give you an
    oddly-shaped surface to work on, but my first impression is that the design is
    way too busy, like you're trying to put something into every available space.
    And you've got the URL 2 times, the phone number 2 times, and the logo 4 times.
    I think once should be enough for each of those. And the symmetrical layout is
    a little static. \r\n\r\nI'd say cut out the duplication, consider a less symmetrical
    layout, and consider using the space you've freed up to put in a picture of a
    jazz musician, for example, as the focal point of the design."

    with those who thought it would be OK to blight streetscapes with \"total graphics\"
    advertising entirely covering public vehicles, rather than discreetly placed in
    panels.\r\n\r\nThe opening sequence of the 1929 film <em>Piccadilly</em>:  title
    credits pass by on the advertisement panels of buses.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttile_4935.JPG.jpeg]"

  body: "I hadn't noticed you'd said \"They requested the layout\". Well, even if
    they requested that particular layout, you could still present alternatives, too.
    \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that moving signs may only be glimpsed for a second or two,
    so the main message needs to be very concise and obvious. With the current layout
    your eye doesn't know where to look; there are messages scattered all over the
    place. \r\n\r\nThe title credit from 1929 that Nick posted, though obviously old-fashioned
    in style, shows a concise message with a clear hierarchy. It communicates effectively."
