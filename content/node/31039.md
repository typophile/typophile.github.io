  body: "Glyphs are just glyphs, you have to tell the font which substitutions to
    perform:\r\nIn the OpenType panel, add a new feature (click the plus in the bottom
    left part of the panel) which creates a new empty feature (displayed in the top
    right part). There, enter something like:\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    f i by f_i;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub f l by f_l;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[etc]\r\n}
    liga;\r\n\r\nwhich tells the OpenType interpreter to replace single \"f\" and
    \"i\" by the ligature glyph named \"f_i\" (or \"fi\" if you call it like that).\r\nYou
    can add other substitution commands by the same scheme.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: is it easily possible to have ligatures that involve three letters? i made
    a www-ligature for my grotesk in the making and remember reading here about not
    being able to make normal ligatures that involve three letters.

    body: "three letter ligatures:\r\n\r\ni'd go like that with it?\r\n\r\nfeature
      liga {\r\n   sub w w w by lig_www;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\n(if the name of the glyph
      is lig_www)\r\n\r\non another note: if i do a www-lig, wouldnt it be good to
      make it \"www.\", because then i can make sure that there's not a strange word
      in a language that has three w's following each other and getting replaced -
      also, makes kerning easier."

  body: "Since glyph names still matter, you better name the glyph \"w_w_w\" so e.g.
    Acrobat knows it is a ligature and must be decomposed to w w w if you copy/paste
    text from a PDF. So:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub w w w by w_w_w;\r\n\r\nOr, if you
    like:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub w w w period by w_w_w_period;\r\n\r\nAlso, you
    can use contextual substitution:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub w' w' w' period by w_w_w;\r\nSo
    w w w will be substituted only if period follows, but the period itself remains.\r\n(You
    could put w_w_w into your w kerning class. Might be that XPress7 ignores this
    then, I don't know, you have to try.)\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    support contextual substitutions. The contextual ligature will work in InDesign,
    Illustrator, Photoshop, QuarkXPress 7 but will not work in Apple TextEdit, Keynote
    or Pages (under Mac OS X 10.4), while the plain ligature will work in all of the
    above. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
