  specific list of words that must be included was provided, and we were given the
  rule that we may use simple colours to create effects/contrast, but nothing else.
  No graphics (I cheated a tiny bit there), no gradients, only one font family. If
  anyone cares to provide some feedback (please, be harsh, down to the minutest detail\u2014I\u2019m
  new, I need to learn), I should be very grateful.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://qvenon.com/files/opg_6_janus.pdf\">Link

    danish that well. It looks very good. You might want to consider taking the colors
    down to two or maybe three, and also use pantone and develop a good looking pallett.
    Those colors are nice but could do with some work.\r\n"

  body: "You should have access to Pantone books somwhere at your uni/learning institution.
    Not only does this make it easier to choose colours which work well together,
    but specifying pantone colours also means you are more likely to have the printed
    and finished product come out with the colours you intended. You need to use the
    right guide for the media you are printing on (coated or uncoated stock).\r\n\r\nI
    think it looks really good - and even though there are less colours in the second
    pdf you posted, I actually preferred the first one; something about the green
    NER which doesn't come through with it in pink. I think perhaps it is that the
    DEMO, in the second poster, becomes the only one of the large words to have its
    own colour - it already stands out much more by being white and being larger than
    the rest. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it may be useful for what the poster
    is communicating (unfortunately I don't understand it).\r\n\r\nI definitely like
    it though\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: Rafe said it with the pantone stuff. It is good to  take a look at all the
    color possibilities you have. The second one is the only option obviously, it's
    stunning. As far as which two colours, that's really your decision. I would definitely
    find a pantone book if you can. Because it is beginning the teacher most likely
    wont mark you down for having more colors, but he will probably enjoy you going
    for less just because it is much cheaper and more efficient in the printing world.
    to make it three colour (say a blue yellow and green) with key(black) would actually
    reduce it by two colours as long as you have the yellow and blue mixing to make
    a green. You obviously seem very interested in this so ask your teacher for a
    few pointers in regards to what we talked about.
