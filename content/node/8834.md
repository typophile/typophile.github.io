  body: Hard to tell from such a rough sample but it looks like it might be hand lettered
    to me. Inconsistencies in thickness of stroke and in the curves.

  body: It reminds me of <a href="http://www.fontpoint.com/freefont/koshgarian-light.htm">Koshgarian</a>
    but thicker. <BR> <BR>I got this font on a 5 1/4&#34; diskette with a few others
    on my first Win 3.1 system back in 1993 or so. As far as I can remember, the booklet
    that came with the font package said it was based on the design for the Pepsi
    logo &#40;maybe designed by the same person?&#41;. <BR> <BR>I cannot verify whether
    or not this font is a rip-off of a real font or not &#40;I seem to remember that
    the diskette also included fonts called &#34;Futuri&#34; and &#34;Cabel&#34;&#41;.

  body: Futuri? Wasn&#39;t that done by Piel Renner? And Cabel by Robert Coch?

  body: Hi Evan, <BR> <BR>Due to the specimen source, it smells vintage to me, Handel
    is too futuristic for this treatment. Check out our Dairyland font from the County
    Fair Picnic. It&#39;s not exact, but it emulates the feel of the letters closely

    old.
