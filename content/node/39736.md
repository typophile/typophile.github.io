  body: If you wish to use fonts you've previously licensed on a new platform I would
    contact the foundry from whom you licensed them. Some foundries might be willing
    to transfer the license to use on a new platform.

  body: I am glad that this little script for batch processing serves. And if you
    don't have the afm files, you can always use FontForge and in "File > Merge Feature
    Info" select the pfm file to get the desired kerning before generating your font.
