  there any cases out there where someone really ripped off the design and layout
  of a site and was successfully taken to court? <BR> <BR>Anyone, Anyone? <BR> <BR>Thanks
  in advance. <BR> <BR>-d

  body: 'Yes, a work is coprighted at the moment of it&#39;s creation. but maximum
    protection is only extended to registered copyrights. In the U.S. you register  with
    the US copyright office at:  <BR><a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/" target="_blank">http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/</a>
    . $30 would cover the cost of a registration of a single image of suite of images.
    My knowledge of copyright law is a result of my volunteer time spent with the
    Graphic Artists Guild. While I&#39;ve never registered a website, I have registered
    many images. The process is similar. <BR> <BR>Mailing a copy to yourself, or &#34;schoolyard
    copyright&#34; proves nothing in a court of law, except that you mailed it to
    yourself. It&#39;s worthless as far as protecting your interests. This wives tale
    will still be around long after the postal service has gone out of business. <BR>
    <BR>Here&#39;s why registration is worthwhile: <BR> <BR>In the event of an infringement,
    an unregistered copyright creator would probably search for a lawyer to take his/her
    case. In court, the holder would then need to prove the damages the infringer
    inflicted, and would be eligible for actual damages. Not many lawyers would take
    that case, because the return would be so small..., and more difficult to bring
    to court. In the end, this person would likely just mail a cease and desist letter
    without any teeth to back it up and hope the infringer does the right thing. <BR>
