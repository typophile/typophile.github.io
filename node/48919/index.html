  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello I am a senior in high school. I know I want to become an artist. The issue is if I want to be a Graphic Designer an illustrator or what ever is left out there for me to major in.

The other issue is if I should go to Tyler school of art, Kansas institute of art, or MICA. I have not been accepted anywhere yet because I need to well apply first I pretty much KNOW I want to go to one of these guys. I was just wondering what you guys think about me going to those places (if I could even make in there) and if you can think of any other good colleges that would fit my type of art.

Here is my little deviant portfolio http://izacchemical.deviantart.com/ now just let me know what you think about this whole situation. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Isaac,
If you know you want to become an artist (in the future), what, in your mind, has kept you from already becoming one?
<cite>...my type of art</cite>
After looking at the pieces in your portfolio, it would be more helpful to me if you used words to tell me what your type of art is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">well I love my cartoony side with my characters and such, but I also love to manipulate photos. 
I am currently getting into Ai. but the thing that has kept me going as an artist is probably been my little characters that I make/ style I use. Though I don't think that it will get me anywhere I still love to do side canvases either way. I am very comfortable with computers and has always wished I was the guy who made those magazine ads but the more i get into art my direction gets obscured on whether I should push my style forward or push my design and manipulation further. 

sorry if that was confusing or not what you were looking for.</div>
