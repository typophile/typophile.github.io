  body: "Thank you for sharing.\r\n\r\nIf you allow two comments:\r\n- The figure
    1 is somewhat ambiguous. In the London Berlin baggage labels I was not sure whether
    to read 1 or 7. It only becomes clear when you have a 7 to compare.\r\n\r\n- The
    R looks unbalanced to me. I'd prefer the counter like in B (not in P).\r\n\r\nAndreas"
