  is a rough look at what I'm working and I would love some basic feedback especially
  for any pitfalls that I should avoid now and in the future.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nI
  realize that the spacing isn't perfect yet. also if the image is too small to critique
  let me know and I'll post a better sample.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_sample_6001.jpg]"

  body: "/C/G/O/ are too perfectly elliptical that they are actually distracting.\r\n\r\n/S/
    has the problems where both curves meet - in the middle.\r\n\r\nSome letters are
    based on ellipses others on circles, which makes letters look like they re from
    two different families.\r\n\r\nLowercase it too tight spaced. Word spacing with
    this letter spacing is way too wide. Some letters are too wide compared to others
    (ie. /V/).\r\n\r\nPut /R/ and /K/ side by side. Do they look they're from the
    same family? I guess not.\r\n\r\nBut keep on doing it. With several adjustments
    it may become a nice display type. I'm not so sure that this can be body type
    at all. At least not using these shapes and this kind of spacing."

  body: "Yeah I'm not really sure what it can be either...I've sort of just stumbled
    into this and realized how much I love it. I just need to get better at identifying
    certain things.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the /S/ has given me problems whenever
    I try to smooth out the middle curve, I guess I need more practice.\r\n\r\nYou
    also confirmed my suspicion that the widths of certain letters were not right
    comparatively...sometimes it gets so hard to tell when you stare at the same thing
    for too many hours.\r\n\r\nI did try to narrow the stroke width on the top/bottom
    of /C/G/O/ but it's hard to tell. I don't like the G at all anyway, but wanted
    initial feedback so thank you.\r\n\r\nStylistically maybe you can answer this
    question for me. I have a small affinity for the way the T is very narrow and
    others are wider which is why I posted as is, but in this case is it trying to
    be two different things? In other words I can vary widths to create a less formal
    display type that is fun/loose but just not when using such geometric shapes?\r\n\r\nI
    will nail down my style, workflow, & chops soon enough. Thanks again"

  body: Just a short answer to your <em>affinity</em>. There's nothing wrong in having
    character shapes with different widths as long as they complement each other...
