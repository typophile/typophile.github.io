  body: "The sequence you show involves two dependent vowel signs being applied to
    a single letter. In normal Bangla text, surely this is considered invalid, as
    only one dependent vowel sign can be applied per letter. So what you probably
    see, at least in Windows applications, is a dotted ring between the two vowel
    signs. This is inserted by the script shaping engine in Uniscribe, and is independent
    of the font lookup tables.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to trick the shaping engine into
    hiding the dotted circle, but this generally isn't advised unless you really,
    really need to do something contrary to normal Bangla layout. If you have evidence
    of more than one vowel sign being applied to a single letter, then you should
    contact Microsoft and present it to them so that they can change the shaping engine."

  body: "I am entirely in agreement with you that the shaping engine should not prevent
    unorthodox character sequences. I have argued with folk at Microsoft for years
    that this is, in effect, spellchecking, and belongs at the language level in applications
    not at the script level in shaping engines. I think most of them are now in agreement,
    but getting longstanding behaviour of a core .dll changed seems difficult for
    them.\r\n\r\nThis is how you can trick the shaping engine. Note that the dotted
    circle (Unicode 25CC) is inserted in a buffered character state, before OTL glyph
    processing. So what you can do is use GSUB ligation to remove the dotted circle
    <em>glyph</em> from the string. You can either do this globally for the font,
    or you can do it contextually, targeting only the specific sequences in which
    you wish it to disappear. So, for example, you could specifically target the double-aa
    situation you illustrate with a VOLT lookup like this (I've used the naming I
    employ in my own Bengali fonts):\r\n\r\n<code>uni25CC bSignAa -> bSignAa</code>\r\nin
    context\r\n<code>bSignAa |</code>\r\n\r\ni.e. changed dotted circle + aa to just
    aa when preceded by aa.\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\nBy the way, the Bangla font you show
    looks a lot like the classic Linotype Bengali. I know there are a lot of versions
    of this design now in use in India and Bangladesh, as well as in immigrant communities
    elsewhere. Which version is this?"

  body: "In other scripts I have put this looking in the 'ccmp' feature. Because ideally
    one wants to get the dotted circle out of the way before doing and text shaping.
    However, I don't think 'ccmp' is processed by Indic shaping engines (although
    you could try it). You could also try using the 'akhn' feature, which processes
    ligations before other shaping. But it might be that the Indic shaping engines
    prevent this kind of trick if the dotted circle is simply not passed to the shaping
    engine for OTL processing on the grounds that it isn't an Indian character.\r\n\r\nAs
    a last resort, you could replace the dotted circle glyph in the font with a zero-width
    no-outline glyph, still encoded as U+25CC. This should get inserted by Uniscribe
    instead of a visible dotted circle, solving your problem. Of course, the presence
    of such an invisible glyph in the string will still prevent complex interactions
    between glyphs on either side of it, but it should work for your aa-aa case."

  body: "This is what the 'locl' feature is for, but I've not tried it in this situation.
    One of the concerns will be whether the European punctuation characters are rolled
    into the glyph run with the adjacent Indian characters. They should be, but operating
    systems and app have been flaky in supporting this. So it may not work, or not
    everywhere.\r\n\r\nTry making a 'locl' feature for the Bengali script and 'dflt'
    language system, and substitute the punctuation glyphs you want."

  body: The case for transliterating e.g. Arabic using Bengali letters seems to me
    serious and should not be something that is prevented by the shaping engine, any
    more than a Latin shaping engine should prevent a sequence of diacritics to transliterate
    non-European scripts and languages. So I agree that this is something that Microsoft
    should change. But then I also think they should completely stop performing what
    amounts to spelling or grammar checking at the shaping engine level, and have
    told them so many times.

  body: "There are a couple of ways in which this can be done. First, it is important
    to note that normal character input order for this should be Consonant + Vowel
    + Candrabindu, i.e. the candrabindu should be typed after the vowel, not before
    it.\r\n\r\nOne method is simply to use an 'abvm' feature GPOS mark positioning
    anchor attachment to position the candrabindu mark where you want it on the vowel
    sign. If you want to adjust the size or weight of the candrabindi in this situation,
    you can do this GPOS operation after first applying a contextual GSUB substitution
    to replace the normal candrabindu glyph with a variant form.\r\n\r\nThe other
    method is to build a precomposed ligature of the vowel sign + candrabindu, and
    use an 'abvs' feature GSUB ligature subsitution to form this from the vowel sign
    + mark sequence."
