  body: "Hi Akira,\r\n\r\nI sincerely apologize for this. The only reason I provided
    the link, is to help Peter to compare his original to the Plak font design - it
    was not my intention to advertize an illegal source for a commercial font.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, you are right and I will follow your advice to refrain from providing
    any links to free resources.\r\n\r\nFivos"
