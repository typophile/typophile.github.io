You should shift ogonek to the right on &quot;Aogonek&quot; and &quot;aogonek&quot;. Lc &quot;k&quot; is too wide for me. All alternative acutes (Polish kreska) on sacute, cacute, nacute, oacute and zacute have too much stepper slope, and now should go to the left. It is nice that you did an alt.acute but for me the first one, is enough for Polish language too. All accents above (not dots) are to weak (light) for me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You have taken on an interesting challenge of having a greater variety of treatments of individual letters, and still have the whole harmonize and balance. I think a PDF with text would help to see how well it harmonizes or fails to and contradicts itself. The few words you posted promise a nice harmony and balance. If it does harmonize it would be valuable, as you would have achieved a greater differentiation of letters, and possibily easier readability, than is usual in a sans.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, the PDF works now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not surprisingly, this is a face that cannot be evaluated in the normal fashion - otherwise one would blindly conclude &quot;it's ugly&quot; and leave it at that. The relevance of such a design is tied to the existence of the &quot;dark half&quot; of reading, the half where a reader doesn't notice the details of the font, but is affected by it nonetheless. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evaluating such a font requires a very strong understanding of readability, and the deeper mechanisms of reading, for example to what extent familiarity matters, and what details readers notice. I don't know anybody who can do this. But I can try to share some of my own hazy insight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I think the &quot;a&quot; needs its lower-right spur. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- And the &quot;g&quot; needs its ear. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The &quot;k&quot; needs staggered arms, maybe one of them bowed. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The &quot;v&quot;/&quot;w&quot;/&quot;y&quot; are too static as a group. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I'd make the &quot;J&quot; descending. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The &quot;@&quot; is too chirographic. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I'd flatten the UC acutes/graves. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The BP is off. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- That &quot;L&quot; in the Pilcrow is bril! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I don't think the Differential should lean. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The Florin should lean though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, looking at the vertical proportions and color, it looks like a face that would work best at larger text sizes, like around 12 point. But for that the spacing is slightly loose. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whatever you do though, don't expect virtually anybody to understand what this is about - the Modernist age is not good at tolerating such extrapolation - it's just something you'll have to believe in, and apply in the best way you can. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; If that were not so, what would we strive for? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I feel the same way.

I suspect that you need to narrow the stemless letters - doesn't Dax do this? And also the a seems too wide to me. The flag at the top of the b sticks out too much; its seems visually higher than the straight ascenders - would shortening it make it more harmonious?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You have quite a challenge getting even rhythm into your unconventional forms, but if you succeed you will have something unique.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the narrower letters and the change in the serif on the b are both good improvements.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now I see your idea of great variation in the letters in your 'cloaked' version. It think it is too much.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a balance between repetition and variation in any pattern to make it work aesthetically. I have heard, I forget where, that in music it is about 50-50. If the melody doesn't have some kind of repetition it doesn't come together as a melody, but just is a series of notes. Thus you have the typical establishment of the theme in four bars, the next four bars with variation of the theme, the third four a different variation, and return to the theme.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In other words with too much variation a melody just doesn't come together as a 'gestalt' that the mind can wrap itself around. On the other hand, if there is too much repetition it becomes boring and annoying, like the infernal 'Doublemint' jingle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that this kind of patterning principle also holds for readability. And I think you have gone too far in the variety direction. But if you figure a way to pull back - there are a lot of ways to do it because you have so much variation - you could end up with something that is balanced and innovative.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, the narrowed top of the g works now for me, where it didn't before.

I think this needs to relate more to the ascender serif also - maybe just being shorter would work. Now, with the serif bending down, it think it should overshoot like the o; it looks short now. Also you could consider putting a stem on the r. As the Underware fellows explain <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the r usually has more of a notch than the m,n. And that helps keep the rn from looking like an m. If you are going to have as serif on the i you might consider doing something on the j and r also. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know what can work here, but I do think that the serifs on the ascenders are a success, and working the face to make it harmonize and work best with these is the way to go.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, you're not speaking to yourself - on my end I was saving the best for last. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Few people can appreciate what you're doing - it's way out there - it requires a dedication to the dark depths of reading - something very rarely promoted. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Know that most type designers who see this will think it's garbage (and most of them won't have the balls to tell you). Some people will think it's &quot;cute&quot;. My advice is this: filter feedback based on context: learn to ignore certain specific kinds of advice from people who might be great conventional font designers but have no real idea of the dark currents sweeping to and fro in the recesses of the human brain. Or: Don't ask a poodle trainer to handle an anaconda. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's a good time to back up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I think you should go for (and you might already be doing this) is a font that creates a texture (at reading point sizes) the layman won't reject, but diverge the forms as much as possible nonetheless. I think you're actually being slightly conservative! But it will make for a great test case. You will have to publish a booklet (not related to typography) that uses it, and ask laymen (NOT other designers) what they think - and ask them in the most indirect -even devious- ways - to see what's really going on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some specifics: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Why are the caps and numerals so conventional? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-I'd make the eye of the &quot;e&quot; smaller. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-I'd make the &quot;s&quot; narrower and the &quot;y&quot; wider. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-I think your accents are generally smallish. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Try making the blank space a hair bigger. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; There is a balance between repetition and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; variation in any pattern to make it work <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; aesthetically. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there's a critical difference here between display and text, between deliberative and immersive reading. The threshold of harmony/discord depends on how deep into the subconscious you're aiming. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is seen as discord by our finicky -and subjective- conscious aesthetic appreciation is used by the subconscious to read more efficiently. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the infernal 'Doublemint' jingle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tellingly in fact, a study has shown the more obnoxious a jingle the more memorable it is!

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, as I said early in the thread, I found this alphabet as having too much variation in it. Your black version has changed the bent stems effectively into serifs, which for me work much more harmoniously. My guess would be that if you worked backwards and did the lighter weights with a similar treatment, you would have a result that would be more harmonious, and have more use. Two things still stick out to me as awkward. The 'k' having the serif go the opposite way from the b and h I don't see the visual logic in. Also the arm on the r seems too heavy or droopy or something.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A lot of successful faces, I have read, have started out very 'far out', and then the designers have pulled back into a more conventional direction, until they had a more conventional alphabet, but with a distinctive flavor.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because type design is in my view by nature a very conservative field (unlike science), I think this is the wiser way to go. But of course I am just one pair of eyes, and not professional ones at that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for your thoughts.  I actually started the lighter weights that way and found the serifs too heavy.  I will give it some more thought now that some time has gone by and I am starting to get a better understanding of FontLab.  I still think the k and h fit my earlier stated design philosophy.  It may take some getting used to for many type-savvy people.  I have gotten so used to it now that it looks quite normal.  When I show it to laymen, they don't even notice even when I point it out to them. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I really do appreciate your continued willingness to share your insights.  You, Hrant, Steve, and a few others here, have been a very supportive group of sounding boards who are always kind enough to take their time to critique my work.

		<div class="commentbody">Chris,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm looking at your Cyrillic. Well, it's a beginning, but you have to do a *lot* of work on it. I recommend that you take a look at ParaType's typefaces. Since your font is black, I'd recommend taking a look at:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?f55ca8b86e1a8e60af8495bfc7b5dcd8">http://www.myfonts.com/url?f55ca8b86e1a8e60af8495bfc7b5dcd8</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?7492efd8ae9cb7d464a951168297962d">http://www.myfonts.com/url?7492efd8ae9cb7d464a951168297962d</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?ccb28769dd0f8d2a65527e8cfe0ddaa4">http://www.myfonts.com/url?ccb28769dd0f8d2a65527e8cfe0ddaa4</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The FreeSet shows you what you can do in a Cyrillic be to compensate the overly blackness (reduce the bowl). Currently, your be looks rather weak. Your Cyrillic i is far too deeply cut-in, looks as if it will fall apart. Connect the slanted element more firmly with the stems. Remember that a Cyrillic I is nothing like a reversed Latin N. Compare:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?410beb03e5667abdc04b7075b0000d28">http://www.myfonts.com/url?410beb03e5667abdc04b7075b0000d28</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?706f3090cb966e757739c1314953a1d7">http://www.myfonts.com/url?706f3090cb966e757739c1314953a1d7</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your Cyrillic ka and zhe are nice, although, since your typeface includes these strange curves like on the top of the Latin k, you might try to make the Cyrillic ka and zhe more curvy, as in the Black Grotesk or Bell Gothic examples:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?e352c081f46e0ea7510a8a5cdbd4f6b7">http://www.myfonts.com/url?e352c081f46e0ea7510a8a5cdbd4f6b7</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?c8bc472ba1152c4d8956565982c4b237">http://www.myfonts.com/url?c8bc472ba1152c4d8956565982c4b237</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fine-tune your Cyrillic el and de &ndash; the left stem of the de should really be slightly slanted. Your lowercase Cyrillic ef is too light, and you're not showing your uppercase ef, so it's hard do say. But you definitely should do some work on that.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The curvy teeth on ce and shcha work well, but they look awfully in the de &ndash; you need to think of something better there. Remember that the teeth in de should *never* point outwards, this makes the letter look like an unskilled skater. The teeth should be either parallel, or they may point inwards &ndash; you sure need some more solid work, and ideally an expert's advice on that.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For a start, your Cyrillic is adequate though. You managed to avoid the most horrific atrocities often found in first-timers' Cyrillics.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may want to simplify the dcaron, tcaron, lcaron &ndash; refer to the diacritics article in <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.magtypo.cz/download/TYPO_2004_10.pdf">http://www.magtypo.cz/download/TYPO_2004_10.pdf</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The lslash in the Black cut as shown in <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporello_Black-53536.pdf">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporello_Black-53536.pdf</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is good but the Lslash is not. The slanted element in Lslash should be flatter (i.e. slightly more towards horizontal) and the right arm should be a bit longer. But principally, the Black is very handsome.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The junction of ogonek with the basic letter in the Bold cut is too thin, but in the Black, it's very good. In other words, in the Bold, it looks as if the ogonek is disconnected from the letter in a uglyish way.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Robert already pointed out, the slanted element in the Light cut as shown in <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporellolite10-29-52377.pdf">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporellolite10-29-52377.pdf</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is just too thin. Also, it lslash, the slanted element is too wide, especially to the left. On the other hand, in Lslash, the slanted element is too short to the right, and too much pointing upwards (should be flatter). Also, in the Light, it really looks as if the ogonek were not connected to the letter, which gives a strange effect. Rotate your &quot;p&quot; by 90 degree to the right and look at the connection between the bowl and the stem: it's much &quot;stronger&quot; than your connection between ogonek and &quot;a&quot;. I do appreciate your attempt to make a sort of an ink trap there, but it's just too much of an in-cut.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, the figures: somehow they look like a plain rip off from Akzidenz Grotesk. They don't seem to follow the style of the letters. They're just too plain and too round <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Best regards,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very good changes. The ogonek in eogonek could be a bit more to the left (some 7-10% of the glyph's width), now its placement is somewhat not harmonous with the other *ogonek glyphs. Good work on the tcaron/dcaron/lcaron. I think your macrons are too weak and a bit too narrow. The slanted element in lslash is now a bit too bold, make it just as bold as the middle element of the lowercase &quot;a&quot;. But the boldness in the uppercase Lslash is OK. Actually, in this particular typeface, you could add a little curliness to your slanted element in Lslash/lslash, just like in Martin Majoor's Seria:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Eluc/atypi2004-prague/516-medium.jpg">http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Eluc/atypi2004-prague/516-medium.jpg</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or in the 1928 Polish Poltawski typeface:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/poltawskilslash.jpg">http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/poltawskilslash.jpg</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This would mean that you'd have to make the endings of the lslash slanted element not completely vertical, but having a slight slant to the left (just as much as in the lower part of the t or l). The curliness wouldn't have to be much, too, but it would add some nice native flair. However, making the slanted element straight as you made it is also fine and looks good.

Since I am not a Russian speaker, I was most cautious about my drawing of the Cyrillic.  I felt uneasy departing too far from what was in my limited exposure to slavic languages. I really wanted this font to be as open to language difference as possible so I felt Cyrillic was a requirement&ndash;and still do. I do want to push the Cyrillic more as you suggest.  I would like to take you up on your generous offer to send scans of Pushkin and whatever handwriting and calligraphy you can spare.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, I found Mathew Carter&rsquo;s critique of your typeface really interesting&ndash;it helped me too. He said of some feature&ndash;one of the bent ascenders I think&ndash;that you don&rsquo;t really notice it text size, and if you don&rsquo;t see it, then you should cut that variation. The idea I carried away that when you do some design feature, it should be done with confidence, and to make a difference. That idea of being very intentional about making a difference with a design feature gave me a better concept myself.</p>
<p>Following this up, I wonder what Leporello &lsquo;Straight&rsquo; would look like. You is so polished and extensive, and that variant might be more quickly welcomed and have strong merits of its own, along with the &lsquo;bent&rsquo; versions.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

I tried that last year. If you scroll back up to my June 20, 2004 post you will see:
&ldquo;The second PDF shows a synopsis of the opera Don Giovanni used as text. It explains the opera as well as my reasoning for the naming; Plain for Leporello as himself, a servant; cloaked for Leporello partially disguised; and Masqued for him as his master.
