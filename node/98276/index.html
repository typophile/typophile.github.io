Did anyone use FLstudio on a touchscreen monitor. What are your experiences? With the advent of Windows 8 I am planning to get a touchscreen PC and I was wondering if it is easy to work in FLStudio on a touchscreen machine

<p>Tested how?  Same screen for both?  Apples to apples?   Please explain.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used Win8 at all yet and was wondering about it.
All I know is: the Surface tablet does not have a high-end screen res.
And that&rsquo;s OK, it doesn&rsquo;t need it IMHO - I&rsquo;d rather see a price lower than the iPad, but the price MSFT is asking, I think is still too high.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Firefox switched to DirectWrite during version 4 and they said the results were pretty good. If IE10 is also using Dwrite, then it should be decent and I just checked it. I took Ellen L&rsquo;s thinking with type website as my example as it contains awfully small text(I am in my early 20s and both my eyes and head hurt if I read that website for some time &amp; god knows about elders) I compared the same text in both the web browsers and as you can clearly see*, IE10&rsquo;s rendering is far superior than Firefox&rsquo;s( I am assuming that FF uses Dwrite and not GDI <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/nattokirai/2011/08/11/directwrite-text-rendering-in-firefox-6/)">http://blog.mozilla.org/nattokirai/2011/08/11/directwrite-text-rendering-in-firefox-6/)</a>. 
So, Thomas I think what you said might be wrong as the render quality is pretty good in IE10 and this is on windows 7 BTW). The left one is Firefox 17 and right is IE10 both on windows 7
*<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The comparison Image<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
UPDATE: I did read at some forums that after enabling directwrite, the fonts look fuzzy and light. Google Chrome 22 doesn&rsquo;t use DirectWrite and I have compared it with both Frefox17 and IE10 which uses DirectWrite. I observed that IE10s rendering beats both firefox and chrome while firefox is slightly better(almost negligibly) than chrome. I am attaching the images here but the difference is not really noticeable. You have to check it for yourself.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chaitanya, in your comparison image, all three browsers are using some form of colour subpixel rendering, so none of these is the new Win8 greyscale rendering. It looks like two different versions of ClearType: the two on the left are consistent, but the one on the right is lighter. I used a zoom tool to examine the pixel colouring.</p>
<p>As I recall, when FireFox introduced DWrite support, it was not on by default, but needed to be set in preferences. I don&rsquo;t know whether they changed this in more recent builds. Unless one knows enough to be able to spot the differences between GDI and DWrite versions of ClearType, the best way to determine which is in use is to look at CFF PostScript fonts: under GDI these will have crappy greyscale rendering, under DWrite they will have ClearType rendering.</p>

<p>Well, looking for Y-direction anti-aliasing (or the jaggy lack thereof, in GDI ClearType with curves coming off the horizontal) is a pretty good clue with TrueType fonts. But yes, the difference with CFF is more obvious.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I want to understand a couple of things clearly as I don&rsquo;t want to put the proverbial foot in my mouth again.(Thomas you were right)</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows 8 Metro interface(the start screen and all the metro apps) use grayscale subpixel rendering. They are using this as RGB subpixel rendering is not optimized for both Portrait and Landscape mode and moving text during animations</li>
<li>Windows 8 desktop environment still uses the subpixel RGB rendering though desktop IE10 uses greyscale subpixel rendering.</li>
<li>Some applications can still access the the old GDI rendering</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay I hope I am right in all the above cases
and now coming back to the experiment. I compared the text rendering of small text on all the three browsers in  desktop mode of windows 8. You can clearly see the grayscale rendering of IE10 vs the RGB rendering of FFand Chrome 
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The rendering of text looks fuzzy and the shapes are not very clear because of the greyscale subpixel rendering.

That being said, i do like the subpixel grayscale rendering as it reduces jaggedness at the larger sizes.
IE10 uses grayscale rendering  and the antialising is very good when compared chrome&rsquo;s and firefox&rsquo;s RGB rendering which is poor.

@John FF17 by default uses Hardware acceleration and hence directwrite.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Typogruffer: I believe your points 1, 2, and 3 above are all correct.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to note with regard to (2) that there is not just &ldquo;the&rdquo; subpixel RGB rendering. There is GDI ClearType, and DirectWrite ClearType. DirectWrite ClearType is much better than GDI ClearType.</p>
<p>The screenshot you posted shows Metro&rsquo;s Grayscale ClearType in IE 10. But the FF17 and Chrome23 samples are definitely showing GDI ClearType, and not DirectWrite ClearType. One can tell by the lack of Y-direction anti-aliasing, visible as jagginess on curves just as they come off the horizontal.</p>
<p>Side note, my opinion: Metro&rsquo;s so-called Grayscale ClearType is often preferable to GDI ClearType for font rendering at larger sizes, and inferior to it with most fonts at smaller body text sizes. It is certainly better than the old GDI Grayscale rendering. But none of these are as good as DirectWrite ClearType, especially at small sizes.</p>
