  be literally etched into stone at various places around our little campus. I found
  a similar font called 'Leonardo' and one that comes close called 'Codex'. Still
  not exact. Look at the H watermark behind the UAHuntsville (which looks to be Arial
  bold).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.uah.edu/govrel/  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think it's more a reference to the \"mathematically constructed\" type
    of the Italian and Northern Renaissance (e.g. <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-durer-caps/>Duerer's
    work</a>). There was the idea that the Roman inscriptional letterforms (see <a
    href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trajan/>Trajan</a>) were based on an ideal
    geometry, so many early designers set out to make letters solely with perfect
    circles and ratios, with less-than-harmonious results.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not Arial
    - it's a serif type, my guess being Georgia Bold. It doesn't really work with
    the Renaissance surroundings.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh, I see. UA Huntsville is Arial,
    but the new logo has a Georgia \"H.\"\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Wrong again; looks like Times
    Bold, not Georgia."
