  body: <em>BATTLING AQUA-LUNG</em> is Franklin Gothic or something similar. <em>MANFISH</em>
    is handlettered, of course. <em>Beauty Bait</em> is Futura. <em>Handbook of Skin
    and Scuba</em> is Cheltenham. <em>YOUNG MISS</em> is Bodoni Bold Condensed or
    similar, and the teasers (<em>UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF</em>, etc.) are probably
    Hobo, but they're too small to tell for sure.
