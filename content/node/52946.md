body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI ran into some trouble making a font, so I decided to join
  up and get some help. I was planning on making a simple font. I used a simple editor
  and made a .bdf file of my font and then I opened it up in FontForge. I then used
  the Generate Font feature and saved the .bdf file as a .ttf (both with the (symbol)
  option and without it) but yet when I open it the .ttf font in Font Viewer, nothing
  shows. On Windows it shows a blank, and on Linux I get a just black boxes where
  there should be symbols in the viewers. I also noticed that the file is only 8kb
  large, so somethings not right. I don't see what I am doing wrong, any help would
  be greatly appreciated. If any file or info is required, please just ask.\r\n"
