  <BR>Here is a first stab at an organic serif. I tried to steer towards the calligraphic:
  the color is fairly even, but not totally even &#40;which I liked&#41;, and I liked
  the upward angle of the serifs. I tend to hate lc &#34;a&#34;s where the bowl doesn&#39;t
  connect, but I think it&#39;s working here with the handlettered feel. I&#39;ve
  also softened the intersections to give more of a &#34;wet ink&#34; feel. This may
  be a problem at small sizes but I&#39;m not planning on setting a novel in it. <BR>
  <BR>I wasn&#39;t really looking at something specific. It&#39;s more of a &#34;brain
  dump&#34; after having absorbed serifs for ages and finally attempting one on my
  own. Hopefully it is &#34;different.&#34; But it&#39;s so hard to tell when you&#39;ve
  immersed yourself in it. I&#39;ll call it a subconscious revival, working name Cuillere.
  <BR> <BR>Your thoughts and suggestions desired. <BR>More to follow. <BR>Thanks,
  <BR> <BR>Randy <BR> <BR>After previewing, it looks like the f could use more weight
  in the stem. Also, any suggestions for inspiring the caps or should I stick with
  the subconscious revival method? :-&#41; <BR>'

  body: Also, <BR> <BR>Any thoughts on the right stem of the u. In a cursory look
    at other serifs I haven&#39;t found anthing like it. Then again, my knowledge
    of type history is fairly limited. I&#39;m just doing what I like. Does it bug?

  body: I agree that the &#34;a&#34; works, but also that the &#34;u&#34; is off.
    My big concern is that this genre might be exhausted. But if making your own turns
    you on, that&#39;s plenty of reason to do it! <BR> <BR>BTW, if this is for text,
    it needs longer ascenders, and I think a slightly darker color as well - otherwise
    you&#39;ll have to loosen the whole thing up. If it&#39;s for display, consider
    making it narrower. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Thanks for the comments. <BR>I&#39;ll take a look at the  &#34;u.&#34; I
    guess if nothing else, designing a face of a certain style makes me appreciate
    that style even more, and notice the nuances that differentiate similar fonts.
    So i guess in that regard, making it turns me on. <BR> <BR>I agree that the color
    is light. If this was part of a family, this would be the light version. When
    the alphabet is more flushed out, I&#39;ll take a look at all the ascenders. <BR>
    <BR>&#34;My big concern is that this genre might be exhausted.&#34; <BR> <BR>Enlighten
    me. What genre are we talking about? And what are some exellent examples in this
    genre? Honest questions - see my first post. And &#40;opening the door&#41;, when
    is a genre exhausted? <BR> <BR>For example, were transitional faces &#40;namely
    Baskerville&#41; exhausted when Mrs. Eaves was introduced. Or did it carve it&#39;s
    own niche? Or was there just a &#34;good enough&#34; explanation of its intentions
    to make it special? I must admit, I&#39;m talking out my arse to some degree as
    I&#39;ve already admitted I&#39;m no expert on type classification and history.
    I just read up on Mrs. Eaves at the emigre site. <BR> <BR>Note: I&#39;m not trying
    to be defensive, more curious how a revival and an exhaused genre jive. <BR>Quote:

    when is a genre exhausted? <BR> <BR>Now that&#39;s a killer question... <BR> <BR>I
    guess it&#39;s exhausted when a new member wouldn&#39;t serve a fair amount of
    users, whether they need it for financial or &#34;ideological&#34; reasons. As
    for Mrs Eaves, what&#39;s great about it is that departs sufficiently from the
    original to be worthwhile. Just make sure you re-space it, &#40;or you use InDesign&#39;s
    optical spacing&#41;...  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#62; the old guys took all the good ideas.

  body: Perhaps we should put it in the font identification forum and figure out what
    it is :-&#41; <BR> <BR>I agree with you both. It wouldn&#39;t stand up to abuse
    at 10 point for a few hundred pages. Too light and too delicate for that. So this
    incarnation is for display purposes. Still curious though, is there a name for
    something like this? &#40;Secretly, I was hoping someone would bust out a reference
    to typographic minutae, &#34;reminds me of early sketches from Dwiggins&#39; landmark
    pink phase... or was it his blue phase?&#34; :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Hrant, to your arsing,
    you have a point on spicing up a few characters. I will look into that. A great
    example of that is Pill Gothic in these forums. You see the a and the g and say,
    hmm this is excellent and different than anything i&#39;ve seen. The rest of the
    set shoots pretty straight. I think this will make a font sell, but i&#39;m not
    sure it&#39;s enduring.  <BR> <BR>When the old guys did come up with a good idea,
    it wasn&#39;t about spicing up a letter. It was about shaking up the whole alphabet.
    In the mean time I will settle for spicing up a letter :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Cheers.

    sure does seem that way when you fly over the centuries, looking at the major
    stylistic branches. But in between each of the stylistic leaps were long periods
    of gradual change and refinement. There&#39;s just at much room for artistry in
    refinement as in revolution. <BR> <BR>Maybe the flare of the leftmost stems on
    <b>h</b>, <b>n</b>, and <b>m</b> should be carried more strongly through the rest
    of their descending stems. As is, the weight of the character seems to rest mostly
    in the left side, with weaker marks hanging off to the right.

    <BR>But what I can tell you is that it seems very early-to-mid-20th-century-German,
    with an American revival of that in the late 70s early 80s. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Aaron, good point about carrying the flare/added weight in the leftmost stem
    throughout. As mentioned in the original post the overall color is intentionally
    un-even since I was going for more of a hand lettered feel. I was thinking the
    first stroke of a drawn character is usually slightly heavier due to a more loaded
    pen. As I &#34;handlettered&#34; this digitally &#40;not copying parts&#41;, the
    thinking didn&#39;t get into all the characters consistantly. Hmmm, I&#39;ll have
    to look back at this &#34;first stroke&#34; idea. If it makes any sense at all
    :-&#41; I probably need to weight up right side of  the a, the left of the u,
    the r, the f, and possibly the diagonal spine of the s. <BR> <BR>Hrant, it is
    likely of German influence. I was recently introduced to the lettering/calligraphy
    work of Werner Schneider. I bet that&#39;s where the a came from. Below is a link
    to classical caps based on his calligraphy work. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.tiro.com/aen_mn.html"

  body: It is a very nice ensemble. The &#34;e&#34; is especially elegant. No doubt
    it will be a great font, also because it looks quite new. And don&#39;t get lost
    in the historical reference spaghetti, the style has strength and someone said
    it correctly, flair. It reminds me a bit of Arrus BT but still it&#39;s not quite
    the same thing, it is just plain distinctive. You should keep working on it, Randy
    <BR> <BR>hrant why do you always want to see heavy fonts? some families are first
    crafted or conceived in their thin versions...
