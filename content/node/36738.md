  body: "<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/cennerik/bold/\">Cennerik</a>
    by Robert Schenk is close. AG Book Rounded has a spur at its \u2018G\u2019 and
    therefore it\u2019s out."

  body: Oops, I changed the thread name without posting that it looks a bit like <a
    href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=vag+rounded&x=0&y=0&sample_text=A%20G%20M%20Q&sample_size=36">VAG
    Rounded</a>. Other possibilities are <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=bryant&x=0&y=0&sample_text=A%20G%20M%20Q&sample_size=36">Bryant</a>
    and <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gothamrounded/index.html">Gotham
    Rounded</a>.

  body: "VAG Rounded has sloping verticals with its M. Bryant\u2019s right-hand side
    of the G has a flat section. Gotham\u2019s G too, and its M\u2019s middle vertex
    additionally ends above the baseline.\r\nThough I don\u2019t think Cennerik in
    fact has anything to do with the creation of the posted sample, I still would
    say it\u2019s closer than the others.\r\n:\xB0)\r\n"
