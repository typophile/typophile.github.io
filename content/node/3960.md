    too. When I first installed Python, it worked, but after a restart, macros weren&#39;t
    available. Running &#34;ConfigurePythonCarbon&#34; in the Python folder got it
    working again....until I restarted. <BR> <BR>Hope someone else has a more durable
    answer. '

    reason =Can&#39;t find a reason&#34; <BR> <BR>But after 3 reboots it has dissapeared.
    It can&#39;t be Python because it has worked fine before. Is there a known conflict
    with another program? <BR>Or do I have to move something from FL to the Python
    folder? <BR>The manual doesn&#39;t say that much.  <BR> <BR>Having proiblem installing
    FL in 9.2.2 <BR>I rebooted with Jaguar, installed it &amp; then <BR>rebooted back
    to 9.2.2 &#40;no, I don&#39;t want to run Classic it&#39;s way too slow.&#41;.
    <BR>Maybe that&#39;s the problem? By installing the software from OSX I automatically
    told the oftware to go for the OSX version of Python? '
