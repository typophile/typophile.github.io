  body: "I rather liked the magic markers idea.\r\n\r\nHow on earth can you defend
    the idea that proportionally spaced numerals are detrimental in this context?
    Oldstyle numerals are probably more legible than lining, and are most likely proportional.
    You can increase the overall tracking if they're too tight. Your grandmother will
    not, most likely, be playing a video game on her calendar.\r\n\r\nLowercase letters
    are irrelevant? If you want her to read the calendar, you'll presumably want to
    use lowercase.\r\n\r\nLeading has nothing to do with what font you choose. By
    which I mean, you can use whatever leading you like. Not sure what this has to
    do with choosing a font.\r\n\r\nI think a face with a large x-height and not too
    much contrast, like perhaps Georgia, could work well, but you probably don't want
    a serifed face at all, due to this not being an art project."

  body: "I seriously wonder why proportionally spaced numerals even exist. Like I
    said, \"11\" is a two-digit number, and should take up two digits' worth of space.
    I can only see very uncommon exceptions to this: for instance, on a feet-and-inches
    tape measure, in which 10 and 11 are of course \"honorary digits\".\r\n\r\nI assume
    that by \"oldstyle\" numerals you mean those with the general appearance of lowercase
    text. I do not want descenders in my calendar. As I said, my grandmother has very
    poor vision. Descenders gobble up space. Also, leading gobbles up space. How large
    do I need to make my calendar pages?\r\n\r\nIf one page is something like:\r\n\r\n2012
    2\r\n06 MO\r\n07 TU\r\n08 WE\r\n09 TH\r\n10 FR\r\n11 SA\r\n12 SU\r\n\r\nwhy would

    page looked. See why I want nothing to do with proportional-width figures here?"

    it yourself, size is probably the most important factor. Make it 11 x 17 rather
    than 8.5 x 11 (if your printer can't go that large, output it at a place like
    Office Max where they have commercial-quality xerox machines that can output 11
    x 17.)  Regarding fonts, it would be pretty simple to do a test. Set a sentence
    if several different fonts and ask your grandmother which is the most readable.\r\n\r\nHer
    ophthalmologist may be able to direct you to other useful resources. A elderly

    Printing House for the Blind Guidelines</a>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<strong>B. Use
    White Space</strong>\r\n\r\nAmple white space makes a page more readable and useful
    because it provides contrast to the print and creates luminance around the text.
    The primary ways to create white space on the page are to use generous margins,
    e.g., margins of at least one inch for letters and other business documents. Another
    way to provide white space is to provide ample spacing, leading and kerning to
    text.\r\n</blockquote>"

  body: "dupling, I find your comments rather amusing. You seem to be misinterpreting
    some type design principles which probably makes you want the wrong type of font
    for your project.\r\n> Lowercase letters are irrelevant. This is, after all, not
    an art project.\r\nAbsolutely ludicrous. What do lowercase letters have to do
    with an art project specifically?\r\n\r\n> Leading is a colossal waste of space.\r\nThat's
    bordering on the psychotic. You know what though, let's reject white space entirely
    and cramp as much information as we can in as little space as possible.\r\n\r\n>
    I do not want descenders in my calendar. As I said, my grandmother has very poor
    vision.\r\nMight be a good idea to DO use oldstyle numerals then.\r\n\r\n> Descenders
    gobble up space. Also, leading gobbles up space.\r\n> How large do I need to make
    my calendar pages?\r\nDepending on the length of descenders they barely gobble
    up any space. Besides, for an optimal reading experience it's recommended to be
    quite generous with the leading.\r\n\r\n> The number 11 has two digits; do not
    try to cram it into one digit's worth of space.\r\nWho does that? You can use
    a unicase font to give each digit equal space, but I have to be honest I've never
    seen two digits crammed into the space of one.\r\n\r\n> The numeral 6 should not
    look like an \"8\"-wannabe. Sorry, Helvetica.\r\nHow does the 6 resemble an 8,
    even in Helvetica? I think only in digital clock fonts the numerals use many of
    the same strokes/shapes but even then the 6 does not like an 8.\r\n\r\n> I will
    not pay more than a few dollars (say, $10) for this font\r\nThat's nothing. There
    are plenty of free fonts which are good, but you seem to be wanting something
    so awfully specific that I think you probably need to spend $20 per font. If you
    want a bit of typographical variety in your calendar I suppose a budget of $60
    could work. If that's too much, search for a freeware option or buy a calendar
    instead.\r\n\r\n> Why is it OK to make old people with bad eyes look at ugly type.\r\nVery
    good point. Why do you worry so much your grandmother won't be able to read your
    type when you can just select a beautiful font and use a larger point size. Depending
    on the size of your calendar there should be more than enough room for all information."
