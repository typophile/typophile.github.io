I recall monitoring some discussion of creation of the font on alt.binaries.fonts during November-December of 2011, but I can&rsquo;t remember the details other than that Claude posted some newspaper jpegs and revisions of the font.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about Claude Pelletier and the only reason I mentioned &ldquo;sweep &lsquo;n hack copies&rdquo; is that the <strong>Chopin Script</strong> offered as a free font by Claude in Dafont:
<a href="http://www.dafont.com/chopin-script.font">http://www.dafont.com/chopin-script.font</a></p>
<p>it actually looks like an exact copy of Phil Martin&rsquo;s <strong>Polonaise</strong> (1923?) which is a commercial font available from URW++
<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/polonaise/urw-d-bold/glyphs.html">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/polonaise/urw-d-bold/glyphs.html</a></p>
<p>With some further investigation though, I see that Dieter Steffmann have also done some digital versions of the font under both(!) names Polonaise and Chopin Script, therefore I&rsquo;m now really confused about what was the original font name and if URW++ has actually any (exclusive) rights on this font.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that <strong>La Tribune CP</strong> seems like an original digitization.</p>
<p>Fivos</p>
<p>PS: See also here for a previous discussion on Chopin Script (probably not a rip-off):

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Phil Martin&rsquo;s Polonaise (1923?)&rdquo; is incorrect insofar as Phil did very little original work and all of it was done from the early 1970s through the mid-80s. Even though he claimed to have designed over 400 fonts in his lifetime, the vast majority of the fonts he personally &ldquo;created&rdquo; were derived from the work of others. The majority of the truly original fonts were licensed from other designers although he ultimately bought up the rights.</p>
<p>Originally Martin licensed many of his fonts to The Font Company, which is long gone. Since URW++ has the fonts I have to assume they are the ultimate licensee, at least. Phil sold his company to a close business friend when he retired. That man presumably still owns the rights.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Doug. Yes pretty similar, which I suspect shows the similar or identical sources. A search of Keystone, ATF, BB&amp;S around 1900 would probably clarify the source issue. From a technical point of view, there is not a lot of wiggle room in designing a very narrow, thick &amp; thin, serif font.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Fivos. No disputing that Dieter Steffmann is a prolific pirate. As for Chopin Script it seems to me that the previous discussion cited by you is balanced and useful. As far as I can see both the versions by URW and Claude meet the same standards of originality, as they are independently created from a non digital work, and both are derivative in that they rely on a previous design.  But the previous design was not covered by a design patent and so, in the US at least,  was in the public domain. Also, in the US at least, the case brought by Summer Stone to prevent use of r terminals that resembled his r &ndash; which he lost &ndash; provides some guidance as to what can be copied by others. There is clear protection for digital outlines generated by a computer program. Otherwise&hellip;. Perhaps the only people who get rich from font design are the lawyers.
Caveat: Non of my comments should be taken as legal guidance, as I am not a lawyer. Nor do they automatically apply to countries other than the US.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks George for the Phil Martin info.
The discussion of what is original work, what is legitimate use of existing designs, what is piracy etc. has been done many times before.
Perhaps it started with the the 19th century technology of electrotyping which enabled font makers to physically lift the imprints of competitor&rsquo;s typefaces to cast their own versions. whithout having to punch cut a copy. Font forgery has been with us ever since. Only the technology changes.
