  set of fonts to create the brand identity. Basically, the firm is a commercial lab
  producing tissue culture plants and plug seedlings. Because the content is so serious
  and has to be scientifically credible etc, I thought a distinctive font scheme would
  help make it interesting. what do you think?\r\n\r\nAlso can Callisto Mt and Gill
  Sans work well together?"
