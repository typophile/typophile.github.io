body: "Wedding Venue fonts suggestions:\r\nI'd appreciate the names of fonts that
  will work well for WEDDING VENUE logo...the logo will be in typographic, classic,\r\n\r\nHowever,
  the wedding reception building is in the same stone and era as the main house and
  is currently being restored, however it is my understanding it will have some rawness
  to it, i.e. wooden ceiling beams and wooden floors etc. Therefore, I'm hoping the
  logo can accentuate a classic style but with some modern simplicity attached to
  it...is it possible for that particular font or a font that can be used for letter
  B in wooden effect and the rest of the the font in classic?\r\n\r\nBrand Attributes:\r\nLuxury\r\nStyle\r\nDistinction\r\nBeauty\r\nHeritage\r\nElegance\r\nSimplicity\r\n\r\nThe
  logo needs to represent classic style, heritage, beauty and luxury. Just as importantly,
  it needs to remain simple for its uniqueness...it does not need an elaborate design
  for it is distinct in its heritage and tasteful blend of tradition and simplicity.\r\n\r\nI
  hope I've explained myself clearly...and thanks for taking your time reading.\r\n "

    would advise against that. Your logotype should be a unified whole. The varying
    effects will only dilute the mark.\r\n\r\nHere are some typeface ideas:\r\n<a

    look dated. Good always: using type that is beautiful and simple.\r\nI recommend
    looking though various cuts of Baskerville for starters."

    I think Garamond, Bodoni, and Caslon have better stood the test of time.

    b) are you just using that as an example ... if a), I'd strongly suggest taking
    some time to come up with a memorable name. If b) as I imagine, then,  nevermind
    about the name. ;)\r\n\r\nHave you considered hiring a graphic designer or lettering
    artist?\r\n\r\nAlso, the first two things that pop into my head for 'wedding'\r\n\r\n<a

    the logo name is Ballymagarvey Village, this is where the wedding takes place
    and for honeymoon. I'm agraphic designer...I'm just responding to my clients request...I
    knew the wooden effect is not an option...the client did ask for samples. I'd
    prefer a good clean font with a money can buy with the letter B or BV somewhere
    with Ballymagarvey Village.\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Coles: I liked Baskerville, Bodoni,
    and Caslon. I wnated to see if there any other fonts that I can incorporate the
    letter BV with  good taste....clean and simple.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Sudweeks : I
    dodn't want to 'fancying' the fonts...it just doesn't work for the venue. I've
    seenthe place and its FABOLOUS place to get married and a romantic honeymoon.
    Wooden effects fonts doesn't gel? I'm verty fond of unified logotype. Thank you
    for the list of fonts you've suggested. I don't like the wooden effect fonts so
    I've made up my mind not to waste my time on it?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
