  a copy of the Gutenburg Press?\r\nIt must have been on four or five times now, and
  I just keep seeing the last five minutes - its on now again, but its nearly over."

  body: I did try the "iPlayer", just to realize that it doesn't work outside of the
    UK. BBC, cultural protectionism is barbarie!

  body: "it's not so much about \"cultural protectionism\" as it is about UK residents
    paying an annual TV licence fee. \r\nWe get iPlayer because we pay for it. \r\n\r\nI
    imagine that eventually, non-UK countries will get paid access via stores like
    iTunes. "
