  and for my graduation project I want to restyle and redesign the tickets of the
  italian railways (you can see the actual tickets here: http://www.blinkerart.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/grafica-biglietto-trenitalia.jpg
  )\r\n\r\nI need help to find a great font that can be used on a train ticket and
  that can express \"italianism\" by his shape.\r\n\r\nThis is the only font that
  I could find: http://www.campivisivi.net/titillium/maps\r\n\r\nwhat about it? A
  made in italy font designed for maps"

    in a display face, you can really only aim for a vague mood of a place.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I personally see nothing at all Italian in Titillium.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Have you researched how they are printed? Tickets consist largely of type
    that is variable (destination, time, etc) and are probably printed on specialized
    equipment that may have limited font options. You may need to "italianize" the
    tickets via color and design rather than font choice (except for pre-printed portions
    of the ticket).

  body: "Yeah, I know, and I wrote to Trenitalia but no answer about print system...\r\nThanks
    all for the suggestions of fonts, anyone know any font used in train tickets?
    (or airplanes tickets..). The first value I need for this project is that the
    font must be engineered for cramped conditions (something like these? http://www.typography.com/collections/cartography/)"

    that they print them using a mechanical system? Metal characters that physically
    transfer ink to the ticket?"

  body: "Otto, these tickets are a fairly common format, and I've seen them used in
    other countries (Luxembourg, Germany, Belgium, etc.). The only differential is
    the logo of the operator in the top-left. The printers are thermal, so its black
    print only. If you want to find out more, I suggest you ask nicely at the train
    station if they can tell you the name and model of the printer, and who makes
    it, you should be able to get more information on their capabilities (or lack
    of).\r\n\r\nAs a lot of rail operators are moving to e-tickets, you might want
    to consider a redesign for those instead as you would (potentially) have more
    flexibility (color, format, etc.)."
