body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nHave just found this site after a year and a half in design
  wilderness!\r\n\r\nAm about to start a company called Bedouin Travel, it\u2019s
  based in London and the main activities are: 1. Islamic Pilgrimages to Mecca and
  Medina in Saudi Arabia and 2. General tours and holidays off the beaten track in
  the Middle East (Syria, Jordan, and Oman amongst others).\r\n\r\nAm looking for
  a font that reflects the companies professionalism in a market full of amateurs,
  with a consistent and clean (i.e. not over fussy or elaborate) brand image. To make
  a similae with cars, when I started the project I was pitching the image level at
  around the Bentley/Aston Martin luxury level when that was not an accurate reflection
  of the product or the market I\u2019m going for. Continuing the car similae, it\u2019s
  more around the Audi/Lexus/Saab/Volvo level of image. Reliable, well made, high
  quality but not necessarily ostentatious, lives up to expectations and comfortable.\r\n\r\nI
  have had a logo designed (see attached) which I do like because it hints at something
  of the east without necessarily being over-islamic because many of my customers
  won\u2019t be. I could change the font of the logo but would need a very good reason
  to do so.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve tried serif fonts (Palatino) not sure it works on web,
  and san-serif (Optimum - which I like but not sure it works for the brand and now
  Avenir - which I really like and is what I\u2019m currently favoring but need reassurance
  on unless there is something much better)\r\n\r\nI need to have my stationery printed
  and want something that satisfies web, business cards and letterhead as I\u2019d
  like it to be consistent.\r\n\r\nAny help would be gratefully received (ps. early
  draft of website is at www.bedouintravel.com)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSaqib"

    the type.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with it? I don't think changing the type will make
    your company any better or worse thought of.\r\n\r\nIf Audi, Lexus, Saab or Volvo
    used a serif typeface for their mark, it would make their cars no less reliable
    or well thought of. Equally, if Bentley or Aston Martin used Avenir it wouldn't
    knock fifty grand off the price.\r\n\r\nIn short, a logo alone does not make a
    good product or service, and you've offered nothing to suggest why the current
    mark is unsuitable.\r\n\r\nRoss"

    like the letters would be higher (but not wider too) than the main text were they
    flipped the right way. \r\n\r\nDid you purposely distort the bottom text? If you
    did, don't. If you didn't maybe I should see about getting some glasses."

  body: "I think the logo works well, though I am not sure it needs the red reflected
    type below it. \r\n\r\nAm I correct in understanding that you aren't looking replace
    the logo but that you are looking for a secondary typeface to use in your materials?\r\n\r\nPalatino
    is a nice typeface, but it may be too similar to your logo. Avenir seems like
    a good choice. It's hard to say for sure without seeing it in use.  You could
    also try something like [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html#|Proxima
    Nova]]. Or look at [[http://www.typophile.com/node/36062|this thread]] which mentions
    several fonts similar to Avenir."

  body: "Hello Saqib,\r\n\r\nI also think you're scrutinizing the logo a bit too harshly.
    \ The typeface is a great selection: appropriately professional and upscale.  The
    \"ligature\" between the 'r' and the 'a' creates a pleasant reference to Middle
    Eastern culture, and is uniquely clever and subtle.  \r\n\r\nI would also suggest
    eliminating the red reflective text.  It's an unnecessary element.  It just adds
    more stuff without enhancing the design.  What do you think about cumaso's suggestions
    for complementary typefaces?\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"
