  of its being true.\r\nThere are two kinds of admirable art. One produces pleasure
  for the recipient insofar as he is a recipient of a certain kind; let's call this
  art \"good\", and the better the kind of person, the better the art. The other produces
  pleasure insofar as it is good and then insofar as it is perceived as <cite>not</cite>
  aimed at any particular kind of recipient, even if it could in fact only please
  an audience of the recipient's kind; let's call this art \"great\", and the more
  apparently impersonal the art and disinterested the pleasure the greater the art.
  \r\n\r\nSo how does type ideally respond, in making verbal art physical, to greatness?
  It cannot now be a matter of matching the personality of the writing, since a fundamental
  quality of the art is its refusal of directed personality. Here's a famous example
  to focus thought, from a response to tragic death in <cite>Cymbeline</cite>. The
  stanza is wholly inappropriate, and in the last couplet meta-inappropriate:\r\n\r\nFear
  no more the heat o' the sun,\r\nNor the furious winter's rages;\r\nThou thy worldly
  task hast done,\r\nHome art gone, and ta'en thy wages.\r\nGolden lads and girls
  all must,\r\nAs chimney-sweepers, come to dust."

  body: "I hate to sound like a cafe philosopher, but what is transparent? Either
    something <cite>marked</cite> as neutral for historical and geometric reasons,
    like Helvetica or Sabon, or a non-choice, like Times, which certainly doesn't
    stop seeming a non-choice just because it's botching great art, or a genuinely
    functionalist design like Unger's Gulliver, which at 11 or 12 point would cease
    to be functionalist - beyond 10 point type can't abdicate from the possession
    of character. None of these versions of transparency would work.\r\n\r\nI suspect
    that one thing the type needs is a kind of traditionality, a perceived removal
    from the present without exoticism - as Shakespeare in the stanza above is traditional
    in his removal from the Marlovian \"mighty line\" and reversion to unpastoral
    but rustic rhyme. Another necessary thing is dignity, a combination of unimpeachable
    austerity and high purpose, not nostril-flaring classicism but granite inhumanity.
    But I'm not going to answer my own question, because I don't know the answer.
    \r\n\r\nIf you want a simpler question: what typeface do you use to set one of
    Shakespeare's mature plays? Or, if none of the existing faces are suitable, which
    do you modify and how?"

  body: "I think you're onto the tension between what people used to try to call \"universal\"
    themes and those that are more \"particular.\" The problem is that we know that
    all artifacts are \"marked\" culturally. But \"culture\" is not something you
    can essentialize-- cultures always interact, overlap, intersect, etc. We can speak
    of \"American\" but also \"Western,\" of \"urban\" but also \"Parisian.\" And
    those are just a couple among thousands of cultural markers-- from the extremely
    broadly dispersed (middle-class technologically-savvy culture) to the extremely
    local (neighborhood culture).\r\n\r\nAlso, consider that even on this forum you
    have members of a certain culture-- wildly divergent as their \"cultural backgrounds\"
    may be, you have people here, who, in one of their signature cultural practices,
    think and talk about typography. They (we) will construct discussions about type
    in that light; you might get a different discussion of, say, what type looks \"good\"
    or \"great\" among a group of high-school students in the Bronx or among fishermen
    in Thailand. (Or they might just wonder why the hell you're asking.)\r\n\r\nSo...
    for me, what makes any typeface good or great or just interesting is that it combines
    some formal features and some cultural markers in ways that make some kind of
    sense to me. I don't just mean, \"I like what I like\"-- I DO try at least to
    think about why I like what I like. I won't go as far as Plato and say that if
    I like it, I MUST believe it's good (so, if I like something bad, I must believe
    the bad is good and therefore have my head screwed on backwards). But I hope the
    two line up in some way.\r\n\r\n "

    body: "As for setting Shakespeare's plays... One problem is that Shakespeare,
      like any author from \"the past\" whose works people still read, is paradoxically
      detached from us culturally (we don't live in Elizabethan England, most of us
      anyway) yet part of contemporary culture pretty much worldwide (he's read and
      has devoted fans and scholars of his work in every corner of the globe, pun
      semi-intended). So... we can't presume that there is a \"period\" typeface that
      must be suited, nor a \"contemporary\" type that we might like but which cannot
      be suited. \r\n\r\nGiven that quandary and all the preceding cafe philosophy
      I've just blabbed, I'd actually probably just default to a something that says,
      \"Here is some writing that is richly textured and greatly admired by many people.
      It's not sacred, and it's not the best or only great writing in the world. But
      it deserves to honored as well as transmitted clearly.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, that
      just sounds like a bad imitation of Bringhurst on picking any type. But there
      you have it."

    that the most complete artistic impersonality always consists in just this perceived

    So type should be great. As for transparency: exactly!\r\n\r\n<cite>The problem

    view doesn't pay attention to the real psychology of response to art, especially
    verbal art. Essentially: sometimes you don't notice the marking, and this seems
    to happen rather more with some artist-recipient combinations than others, and
    also more with some artists than others. \r\nShakespeare: <cite>It\u2019s not
