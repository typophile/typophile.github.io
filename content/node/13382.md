  my typeface fetish, shh\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyway, first order of business:\r\nA Logo
  for an online Scrapbooking supply store called The Memory Loft.\r\nThe basic idea
  is classic, but not stuffy.\r\nClean but detailed.\r\nControlled, but also indulgent.\r\nSomething
  to aspire to and be inspired by.\r\nDesign elements pastiche from roman, gothic,
  victorian architecture.\r\n\r\nHere is the design I have been tweaking on for a
  while:"

  body: "I like the symmetrical balance because because it is suitable with classic
    form. I would recommend as a start to less the size of \"Memory\" to give more
    air to your logo, and you may at that manner use a sans serif font.\r\nThe contrast
    between calligraphy \"The\" \"Loft\" and serif \"M\" inside them is makeing a
    drop for my eye.. because I am seeing Serif \"M\" entered the logo toughly.. espcially
    that oriantl shape which help to draw a reveresed triangle in \"M\" upper charge.
    The triangle is going to confuse eye while it is reading. I think you may use
    more smooth \"M\" and give some better relation between \"The\", \"M\" and \"Loft\"
    because It doesn't look fine for me the way \"Loft\" pasted to \"M\"\r\n\r\nI
    agree to loose the URL and  I recommend \"Where scrapbook dreams come  true\"
    to be at some sans serif font aslo, just in case the logo gone small.\r\n\r\nFor
    that decorative shape I like how you drew it. And Good job in general\r\n"

  body: "I would like to see the M working with a non-symmetrical ornament, or rather,
    less symmetrical than the one you have. The colour of the type is overwhelming
    the gradation. Have you looked at using the ornament and M as the focus and have
    the name of the business below as completely subordinate. The tagline has too
    much tracking and should use small caps as the W is way too heavy for the rest
    of the line. And the ME in MEMORY could do with a touch more space and to align
    the top serif with the lefthand serif of the M. Having said that it does present
    a strong concept.\r\nTim"

  body: "Thanks for the great feedback.\r\nI've acutally been tweaking with many of
    the same things you have all mentioned here: Spacing between The and M and Loft,
    spacing and size of Memory, color of dingbat, small caps in tagline, etc.\r\n\r\nThe
    thing I really had not worked on was what shawkash said about the readability
    across. The dingbat breaks up the flow and Memory forces the eye down; these issues
    make it too hard to read. I'm not sure how to address this problem without significantly
    redesigning the whole thing. Does anyone else see this as a problem?"

  body: I see what you're saying about it being awkward to read straight across. The
    only thing I can think of to fix it without a major revision would be to somehow
    put "Memory" over the "M" and perhaps make the "M" a lighter color, like what
    you've got in the dingbat.

  body: you may change the "M" shape to something more smoother just to break the
    reveresed triangel. you may also give changes for ur decorative graph.. it is
    all just brainstorming from me

    general style, but as others have mentioned, it doesn't feel finished yet.\r\n\r\nTo
    my eye the capital L breaks the visual symmetry. 'The' snuggles up nicely against
    the capital M, but on the right I'd almost wish 'Loft' to lean to the left. The
    L takes up a lot of space. Have you tried un undercase L? \r\n\r\nIt is nice work,

  body: "James, I like the mark as a mark. It's visually diverse and grabs my eye.
    But the moment I try to get something more from it, it's a 4-way traffic jam.
    If I had final say, I'd say \"drop the 'memory' part\", but it's 'The Memory Loft',
    not 'The M Loft' (which I kind of like more, but that's irrelevant here). It works
    if you don't try to read it. The visual scale shifts too dramatically from element
    to element, particularly since they are meant to be read in a line.\r\n\r\nI'd
    suggest either figuring out which elements to eliminate/visually supress, or let
    this beautiful and florid creature go. I'm in love with the M and the ornament,
    but love doesn't make a good logo, unfortunately. Also, ditch the full cap 'W'
    in the tagline, or use full initial caps on every word. The 'W' disrupts the symmetry.l\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    if you shrink and track the word 'memory' it'll work, as shawkash suggested? Make
    'memory' as out-of-the-way as you can, since the viewer only needs it once to
    decipher the meaning of the 'M'. This may backfire at small sizes, though. This
    all hinges on how happy the client is with the idea that they'll almost inevitably
    end up 'The M Loft' in people's minds. It's a great start, but you may need to
    backpedal."

  body: "I would second crugens comments.  I read it as The M Memory Loft.\r\n\r\nI
    also think, you are losing some of the core aspects of a scrap book, which is
    the idea of \"made by hand\".  I guess you are touching on that with the script
    face, but when I think of scrap books I think of tape, glue, torn edges, and lots
    of handwriting.\r\n\r\nThat said, I like the classic aspect you are working into
    this.  Sort of like if Tolleson were making a scrapbook (i.e. reference the classic,
    and refine it to a diamond.)\r\n\r\nnot into the gradient so much.  neither the
    capitol small cap W, not needed really.\r\n\r\nI'd also think of some kind of
    frame for this.  think old books, old scrapbooks.  They always have such cool
    frames around their titles.\r\n\r\nanyways..."

    charge that also flows with the rest of the design. Any suggestions for a typeface?\r\n\r\nRegarding
    incorporating a more \"scrapbook feel\" to the design: I agree  these designs
    don't conform to the stereotypical scrapbook look. I guess that is part of the
    idea here. Scrapbooking is moving quickly into new directions, and many scrapbookers
    (including my clients) feel the rubberstamp typefaces, etc. are outdated and frankly
    becoming trite."

      Typophile forum. \r\n\r\n<em>shawkash, I\u2019m having trouble finding an M
      with a smoother/higher charge that also flows with the rest of the design. Any
      suggestions for a typeface?</em>\r\n\r\nMy own advice for you, is to go for
      a Calligraphic form, which is clean and readable. May be like Roman Calligraphy
      because Roman is reflecting the old times and classic, also because it is still
      gives 2 aspects of calligraphy and some type feeling.\r\n\r\nYou may also open
      it in your vector editor (Freehand or illustrator or any ) and begin to convert
      your fonts to paths, and draw a dynamic relation between M and other 2 words
      beside it.\r\n\r\nThis is my own suggestion, I think it will save your time
      rather than going to branch ideas like the 3 expriment you sent here. Btw, good
      jo b at expriment 3. I just found the orienment is not the same quality like
      the first. "

  body: "While experiment #3 still needs work, I think it's the most successful. It
    reads as 'The Memory Loft' and the 'M' makes a stronger singular mark. It's got
    a lot of great potential, but the 'M' needs tweaking to read better. I'm eager
    to see what you come up with.\r\n\r\nI like your font choice, as well.\r\n\r\nI
    know it's been said before, but you should create a solid logo, then design the
    tag and URL to work with it. Having that clutter around it makes it harder to
    focus on the design of the logo itself."

    that comes to mind when you think of a scrapbooking store.\r\n\r\nA tagline is
    best used in a logotype if the symbol is best used small as opposed to a larger
    symbol.\r\n\r\nThe core of the design speaks more to the view/customer than everything
    thrown together."
