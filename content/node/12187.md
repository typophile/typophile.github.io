    but I'll pick it up.

    body: As an Identifier, I wouldn't worry too much about "new window" attributes.
      I think most users will be able to go back and forth or initiate a new page
      on their own.

  body: If you hold down shift whilst clicking the link, it should open automagically
    in a new window.

    in a new tab on both firefox and safari.

    yes, Lex, there was a much easier way before - you just typed \\newurl{ before
    your link (and then close bracket at the end). I'm still getting the hang of the
    new site."

    would be "verboten". Put Optima and Helvetica on that list too and you'd only
    have blank packaging ; )
