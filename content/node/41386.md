  their was a song called \"GBI: German Bold Italic\" about an imaginary typeface,
  Kylie Minogue did the vocals.\r\n\r\nHere's the record cover, I can't identify the
  typeface used\r\nhttp://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00000I2IS.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg\r\ncould
  it be that they did a custom job and actaully called it 'German Bold Italic', as
  far as I know Towa Tei, the bespecaled Japanese guy in the video, and composer of
  the tune used to be a graphic designer. \r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested, here's
  a link to the actual song\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlAUJCiLpVI\r\n"
