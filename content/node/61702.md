  admit, it's got curves in all the right places. But I'm a bit leery when it comes
  to all-in-ones. It uses SPL (Samsung Printer Language), so no PCL or Postscript.
  It does 1220 dpi \"effective\" output, so that already tells me that there are some
  compromises with respect to output quality. I've never seen 1200 dpi \"effective\"
  output (just true 1200), so I don't know how well it can approximate true 1200 dpi.
  \r\n\r\nI have no experience with Samsungs, really, but I think I'd be hard-pressed
  to top what my HP Laserjet P2015 can do in terms of print quality (1200x1200 as
  well, and even the 600 dpi is oh-so-crisp and clear.) At least in the $300-$400
  price range. This Samsung doesn't quite seem like a workhorse, and I'm not too tickled
  about the 100-sheet tray, either. \r\n\r\nIt seems incredibly well-mannered, though.
  Very quiet, and apparently very polite.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Opinions?\r\n\r\n"

    probably really 610 dpi plus some tricks, like variable dot sizing or just running
    the paper through more slowly so the dot pitch can build up on the thru axis.
    I can't tell for sure without checking the specs, which I didn't. Those are old
    tricks I mentioned. There may be new methods of artificially boosting resolution
    that I don't know about, or improvements to these."
