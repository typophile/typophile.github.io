body: "I started to read <em>Great Expectations</em> lately and I found something
  very interesting in the second paragraph of chapter one. A text which describes
  the image a little boy has of his dead parents. The interesting point is, this vision
  is shaped by the typeface on the tombstone of his parents as Dickens writes:\r\n\r\n<cite>The
  shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout,
  dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,
  \"Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,\" I drew a childish conclusion that my mother
  was freckled and sickly.</cite>\r\n\r\nInteresting to me is that obviously the author
  found that type might reveal something, carry a meaning of its own apart from the
  information in the text, and that this inherent feature of a typeface is somehow
  universal, as a little boy is able to reflect on it. I guess nobody is on a wrong
  path with taking type seriously."

    typographic design should aspire.
