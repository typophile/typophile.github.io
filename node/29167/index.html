<p>the cover is a scan from derek birdsall&rsquo;s &lsquo;notes on book design&rsquo; i had omitted to note that the cover was designed in 1969, apologies this would perhaps explain the subtle differences, im guessing that big caslon is the closest that im going to find digitally?</p>

<p>Big Caslon was done in 1994, so it&rsquo;s definitely not that. Also the squashed non-descending J and the strange a are something Carter wouldn&rsquo;t have drawn.</p>
<p>Depending on the size you want digital Caslon 540 might do you fine. Given that it&rsquo;s Penguin and English, English Monotype 337, which Patty mentioned, is a likely guess also, but I don&rsquo;t have any copy of the Roman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably have to do the research on large sizes of metal 337 and 540 to nail it definitely, unless it&rsquo;s photo type, which I kind of doubt.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t be digital, of course.</p>

<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Bacon, IIRC, said that &ldquo;There is no beauty but that has a strangeness of proportion in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here the J and a are just ungainly in my opinion. By the way, Caslon himself was perfectly capable of drawing these.</p>

<p>Well, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whole thing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is ungainly in my opinion. But I&rsquo;m assuming -rather safely- that Carter for one is much deeper than me concerning letterforms; but really that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are much deeper than me (and you).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Do you mean somebody else drew those? That&rsquo;s quite probable, especially considering how many people had a hand over the centuries in what we call Caslon. And when was the &ldquo;J&rdquo; introduced into type?</p>
<p>That said:</p>
<ol>
<li>Caslon wasn&rsquo;t really a &ldquo;quality is job 1&rdquo; kind of guy&hellip; Like much of his variation between sizes is just slobbery.</li>
<li>What point size is this sample? Scale is central to type, and Caslon wasn&rsquo;t a specialist in poster type I don&rsquo;t think.</li>

<p>Yes, I suspect it&rsquo;s not from the Caslon foundry, but a large size of ATF 540 or Monotype 337&ndash;or maybe Ludlow, as it&rsquo;s so large. It would look even more irregular if it was the real thing. Also it would have more &lsquo;moxie&rsquo; and a probably more even color.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when was the “J” introduced into type?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caslon drew non-descending J&rsquo;s, one of which at least is pretty ugly&ndash;with a tiny ball at the terminal, like this one.</p>
<p>I suspect this is a re-drawing of actual Caslon, but not the real thing. The round arches on the o and e are light compared to the stem of the n, and that&rsquo;s not usual with Caslon. But his stuff is sometimes so irregular that you never can tell. Neither Big Caslon not digital Caslon 540 have the light o and e.</p>

<p>Certainly not (too early). These covers were printed litho, but from metal type composition. The type was photographed, resulting in a negative through which an offset plate was exposed. Due to (under)exposure the hairlines got thinner.</p>
<p>Also note that Wo is kerned. Of course, kerned logotypes ware available, and, too, kerning was possible by filing. But I assume it is more likely that the lettering was hand drawn, or at least a work-up from the original composition..</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Experiments with photocomposition date back to as early as the 1930s. And according to the Monotype Recorder Monophoto and Lumitype were &ldquo;commercially accepted&rdquo; already in 1957. But their use for high speed compositions jobs, such as phone books, catalogues, magazines and newspapers, is quite something different than cover design. Let alone that Caslon and other distinguished display faces were available as photomatrices.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I described above was common practice and moreover explains the extra light hairlines.</p>

Either the publisher, or the designer has lost track of the dates. Either way, this is still a long time before Big Caslon, but if it was done in the early eighties, almost certainly Ludwig is right. Most of the studios in London at that time were artworking from phototypesetting and re-photographing their paste-ups.
