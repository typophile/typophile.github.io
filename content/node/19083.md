body: "Hi everyone,\r\nI need some suggestions for a font to compliment Bank Gothic:
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/\">Bank Gothic</a>\r\nThe
  client has a logo in dark blue and orange set in Bank Gothic Medium with a Nikeish
  swash around it. They specialize in energy consulting. Now they want a different
  font to embed in documents to make their profile more distinct. When this is not
  possible they will use Arial.\r\n\r\nThe new face has to work in both text and headlines.
  Bank Gothic is a square geometric font, and I'm looking for a flavor of this in
  the text font as well (without losing legibility). They need at least regular, medium
  and bold in italic as well. Small caps would be good as well, but it's not a requirement.
  Opentype would work best, otherwise PC postscript.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nOystein"

  body: Bank Gothic is a 1930s Morris Benton design, so FB Agency, a revival of Benton's
    square text face from the same time, would complement (not compliment) the old-fashioned
    look.

  body: "Agency wouldn't work for text though.\r\n\r\nTo compliment Bank Gothic I
    might consider a particularly rounded font, such as Gotham, Avenir or Futura.
    I think to use a different squarish font - and Eurostile is another of course
    - might fight with the Bank Gothic and be difficult to read for running text.
    \r\n\r\nYou could then use Bank Gothic or Agency for the headlines."

  body: "I have used Klavika for another company, but then for identity. However,
    both Klavika and Morgan might be too difficult to read for running text, as Patricia
    points out. I'll give them a try though. But Gotham or Avenir might be better
    complements (I saw the other post Nick, I just had to:).\r\n\r\nThanks everyone."
