body: "Hi! Back in the 90s I was really into fonts. I even supported Adobe fonts at
  one point. SO please forgive me that after ten years of Mommy Brain I seen to have
  lost most of my font skills.\r\n\r\nHere's my situation: I'm publishing a book through
  CreateSpace, and of course, I would like the font to look good. Currently when I
  print from Adobe InDesign CS5 to my Brother DCP-7040 printer, the Baskerville font
  I'm currently using looks not up to standard, IMO. The regular text looks broken
  up on the thin lines, and the larger, bold text shows jaggies if you look at it
  closely.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't need this to look fantastic when I print it to my crappy
  Brother multifunction printer that probably needs a new toner cartridge anyway.
  I just need it to look excellent when the actual book gets printed. The workflow
  is InDesign > PDF > CreateSpace.\r\n\r\nSo toward that I end I could use help determining:\r\n--How
  can I find the font files on my Mac (running Lion OS) and determine whether I actually
  have a legitimate quality copy of any given font? I am not set on Baskerville, but
  I have no idea where any of these fonts on my system came from, as I don't believe
  I purchased any of them, they just must have come either with the system or some
  apps.\r\n--How can I then embed that font in the PDF I create from InDesign?\r\n--What
  settings in InDesign can I use to ensure high-res printing, either from InDesign
  or the resulting PDF?\r\n\r\nI understand this is a type forum not an InDesign forum,
  so if you can only answer the first question, that's cool."

  body: "The typefaces that came with your Mac OS should be foundry quality, so that
    shouldn't be an issue. As for fonts from other sources, that depends on the source.\r\n\r\nFont
    Book, which comes with your OS and can be found in your application folder, will
    allow you to look at all of the fonts on your computer and to get detailed information
    about them (including where they reside on your hard drive).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FontBook_4073.png]\r\n\r\nWhen
    you export your PDF from InDesign, even the \u201CSmallest File Size\u201D setting
    will embed your fonts (usually just the glyphs you used\u2014a \u201Csubset,\u201D
    not the entire typeface) as vectors, ensuring good print quality (ancient Brother
    printers excepted). The \"High Quality Print\" and \"Press-Ready\" settings have
    more to do with the images and their resolution output than with the type.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps...."

  body: Your printer can do "up to" 2400x600 resolution. Besides everything else,
    you should also check your driver settings to make sure that you have it set to
    max resolution/quality.

  body: "In InDesign's Print dialog box, under Advanced, uncheck \"Print as bitmap.\"\r\n\r\nAlso
    try making your text rich black, even if your printer only has a black cartridge.
    Tjis is more important when printing from PDF rather than straight from InDesign;
    Acrobat will print pure black as dark grey on some printers."
