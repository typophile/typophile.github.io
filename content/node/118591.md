  quite a few large notes in Classical Greek. I''m thinking about buying Garamond
  Premier Pro (which I''ve used before and really like), but first I wanted to see
  if someone here has other suggestions of nice serif fonts with a good polytonic
  Greek character set.'

  body: "Because you mentioned Classical Greek text, does the font has to be like
    SCHOLAR? I like its English version and Russian, but Greek is too different from
    them. Did you thought about something more \"light\", where the variation in the
    width of the stroke would be less? I wouldn't choose Gentium for your purposes.
    And while GFS Elpis and Minion are also good fonts, I would leave them at the
    end of list, always considering the Classical Greek text.\r\nI've tried Warnock
    Pro and Sirba, which are quite good for typesetting in Greek language, but I'm
    not sure if they support polytonic...\r\n"

  body: Andreas, I didn't want to repeat the same list, since a lot of good fonts
    are enumerated already in http://typophile.com/node/114656 :)
