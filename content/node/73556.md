  serif, they love Archer for their brand serif, but Archer is not an inexpensive
  font to license. Hoefler actually does offer non-profit discounts, but only for
  50+ licensees\u2014 they're smaller than that.\r\n\r\nHas anyone come across any
  similar slab serif with a similar look and feel (and a full set of characters, and
  good kerning pairs) offered by a less expensive foundry?\r\n\r\n(Also interested
  in finding something almost as good as Sentinel if it's out there\u2026)"

  body: Two friendly slab serifs that come to mind are <a href=http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-slab/>Museo
    Slab</a> and <a href=http://www.psyops.com/html/detail.php?fontname=oxtail#>Oxtail</a>.

  body: Ooh, I wasn't aware of Oxtail.  That's a great find, thanks! For this use,
    both Museo and Oxtail are just a little too "playful" for what I need though.  Gosh,
    Archer has this amazing balance between personality and formality that I really
    haven't been able to find anywhere else.

    regarded your link because I assumed it was the classic style of bodoni with the
    really thin horizontals."
