  from Google Books)\r\nThis is the only mathematics book that i have read with this
  kind of font. \r\n\r\nI'm curious to know:\r\n- what is the font in the main text\r\n-
  if possible, what is the sans serif font (bold) used in the R at the end of the
  first paragraph, the P at the end of the line marked with three triangles, and the
  two E that come after (ii) and (iii).\r\nI hope my explanations are clear enough.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!"
