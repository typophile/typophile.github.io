body: "InCopy is great. Or is it? I work as a newspaper page designer and our writers
  recently switched from Word to InCopy, and as a result I can give them spaces on
  the page, paragraph- and character styles to work with, and all the terrors of importing
  microsoft rtf:s with all their attached problems are gone. We all love it, and the
  typo is great (because they can work with the headline on the page while I work
  with other stuff \u2013 we save time). The whole editorial system is now built around
  InDesign and it's pretty smooth, even if Quark as a layout program was a lot faster,
  even on old G4's. However, I'd like to hear comments on InCopy. It seems like it's
  only used by bigger newspapers in their editorial systems ...  why?"

  body: I've been thinking of getting InCopy. I'm a freelance designer, but I produce
    everything from business cards to books in InDesign and I detest problems with
    Word. I think you've convinced me!
