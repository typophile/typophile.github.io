  I don't find the Fontlab manual very user friendly on that point.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: 'There are a lot of things you can do to maximise FontLab''s autohinting without
    getting into manual tweaking of hints. See [[http://scripts.sil.org/NotesOnHintingWithFL|Notes
    on Hinting with FontLab]]. Adam Twardoch wrote up a much more detailed follow-on:
    [[http://www.fontsurgery.com/fonts/font-dev/hinting/autohinting-with-fontlab-studio-5/|Autohinting
    with FontLab Studio 5]]. You may also want to try avoiding FL''s hinting altogether
