body: "Hello everyone, \r\n\r\nI'm brand new to the forum but in need of some help!\r\nI
  designed my own business card while I was still at university, and was pleased with
  it at the time, but it is beginning to show it's age!\r\n\r\nThe card consisted
  of a rendered 3d letter \"e\" with a black background (see below). On the right
  side of the card, I wrote my name and details in white with Magneto for my font.
  It's just not doing it for me. I am a video editor/3d animator living in London.
  I want to convey a modern, smooth image, without being too \"out-there\" for the
  average person that I might give my card to. I am still generally happy with this
  background image, but I welcome any and all advice in regards to colours, layout,
  font (ESPECIALLY font), etc.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for taking the time to
  help me!\r\n\r\n~Erven[img:sites/default/files/old-images/E_Logo_3499.jpg]"
