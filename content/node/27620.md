body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am designing a title for an awards show and the segment
  I am doing is \"Rising Star\"\r\nI have attatched my design for it,I doubt the word
  \"rising\" is even legible,but with my other solutions it seems to drift off from
  the original star shape.\r\n\r\njust wondering if you guys have any tips,or could
  recomend a triangular font I can base my letter forms off that would be cool as.\r\n\r\nThanks
  Al"

  body: "I think partly the problem is that star has a perspective wheras rising doesn't,
    the mixture of case is also contributing to the unreadability I can only read
    S and G comfortably, since you have an uppercase R in star I think you need to
    develop that for rising. The N reminds me of A from <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stop/\">Stop</a>.
    Overall I think you need to start with a more <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=constructivist\">constructivist
    typeface</a> or draw the characters based on something similar, to two equal rectangles,
    then create the perspective, if you are using Illustrator or similar it is easy
    to distort, then mend the damage done by the distort, it should help get the weights
    of the strokes more realistic.\r\nTim"

  body: "It's nice looking and stylish, but quite unreadable in its current state.\r\n\r\nMake
    no mistake: readability is the first priority for a graphic designer. The very
    first. Make your logo so \"that he may run who is reading it\". If you don't have
    readability, you don't have anything. Make it readable, then make it beautiful."
