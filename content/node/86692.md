  body: "Youssef, I've typeset two books (novels) in Hoefler Text a couple of years
    ago. The typeface, which has a dark and functional texture - think of classical
    letterpress feel - looks fine in offset printing, though, like any other fonts,
    it has its own idiosincracies that one could appreciate or not. For instance,
    long periods of texts set in italics may look too heavy (that was my impression),
    and the italic Q may look too \"ancient\". But I guess that it could be appropriate
    for an history book. For headings, Hoefler Titling - which has a very nice and
    elegant design - could work too. Sabon could be also a good choice, though the
    digital versions, to me, seem to lack some \"character\"; Minion is a perfect
    choice for essays, but it doesn't thrill me. Calluna or Maiola could give your
    book a more original and contemporary feel. Let me also suggest you two typefaces
    that I've been using both in novels and essays in the last year: the superb Cycles
    by Sumner Stone and Athelas by Jos\xE9 Scaglione."
