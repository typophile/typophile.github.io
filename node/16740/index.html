  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm typesetting a book right now in Spanish to be printed in Mexico. (Although the book is being put out by a Canadian group; NAFTA at work!) I wanted to check if there are any differences between peninsular Spanish rules and Mexican (and Latin American) rules. 

These are the rules I have for Spain:

1) Page ranges are supposed to use hyphens instead of en-dashes 
2) Points of suspension are not spaced out [...] 
3) Dashes separating a switch of idea ---like this one here--- are set up close to the phrase being delimited
4) There is a space before % (what about other punctuation, some of the authors put space before colons [like this : ], but some don't)

Which of these are hard-and-fast rules, and which are tendencies? And an additional question:

5) What is the generally accepted way to write long numerals? 4,300; 4.300; 4300; 4 300?

Thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, if you are going to do frequent work on books to be published in México you would like to buy "Manual de Diseño Editorial" by Jorge de Buen.

1) I'm not sure, but my feeling is that it's right. Altough I find it difficult there to be a convention on this, I can recall seeing them that way.

2) Ellipsis are spaced (a normal space) when opening and not spaced when closing. If they are used instead a word or as an intermission in a continued prhase they are treated like a word: a space before and after. They can be placed before or after the closing question or exclamation marks, depending on the sense of the prhase.

3)Dashes are not spaced from the first and the last words of the prhase they contain or mark.

4)Percent is separated from the number with a thin space.

5)Numerals are suposed to be grouped and spaced three by three and a comma is supposed to separate whole units from decimals, but most of the people uses commas to separate numerals in groups three by trhee and a period to separate whole units from decimals. Numbers of four figures are not separated in running text.

Examples of how is it supposed to be done.

   11 234,5
7 434 542,23

Examples of how is it more frequently done:

   11,234.5
7,454,542.23

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you very much, Héctor (especially for the reference to the Manual)!

For the ellipses, my question is not the space before or after, but rather within. Spanish examples I've seen have the periods much closer together than most English examples (although there is an argument there).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some other differences I recall, languages and gentiles are not capitalized in Spanish (mexicano, francés, español, alemán) and the months and days of the week are neither capitalized at least they are part of a proper name.

Dashes are not used as colons.

Hypentation is entirely syllabical, so it's much easier than in english.

These: «quoute», are the quotation marks that are supposed to be used in Spanish but English quotation marks "quoute" are very used as well. The order of the quoutation marks to enclose a quoute inside others is: « “ ‘ ’ ” ».

Titles such as those of books, tv shows or teather plays are only capitalized in the frist word.
