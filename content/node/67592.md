  done with le corbusier oldface:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Headline+Fonts/Le+Corbusier/Oldface/]]\r\n\r\nthe
  client doesn't have any rule at all for corporate image so i was wondering about
  the choice of a text font to use with le corbusier (that i think to extend as display
  font for the project).\r\nmy idea is to use a sans serif, relatively modern font
  to \"isolate\" titles and to stay neutral also because of the great strenght of
  the primary font, but all suggestions are really appreciated.\r\nthanks a lot, bye"

  body: I think you could go for a serif, as long it's "modern" (in the didone sense)
    and that you don't use it in weights heavier than semibold.

  body: "Lineto's <strong>Le Corbusier</strong> is indeed drawn in the style of a
    \xBBDidone\xAB or Modernist/Romantic letter.\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>For a <strong>Bodoni</strong>
    that is suitable for extended text, you have three good choices:</dt><dd>[[http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/itcbodoniovervie.html|ITC
    Bodoni]]</dd><dd>[[http://www.linotype.com/118/bauerbodoni-family.html|Bauer Bodoni]]</dd><dd>[[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/290005.html|Berthold
    Bodoni]]</dd></dl>\r\n\r\nThe last two date from 1924\u201326 and 1930, respectively;
    a period when Le Corbusier was active.\r\n\r\nOther Romantic faces would include
    <strong>Didot</strong> and <strong>Walbaum</strong>.\r\n\r\nHowever, you specifically
    mentioned that you are looking for a sans serif. Here the task is more difficult,
    but it is not inconceivable to pair a Romantic Modernist serif with a Geometric
    Modernist sans serif such as <strong>Futura</strong> (c. 1925) or even <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/memphis/|Memphis]]</strong>
    (c. 1929).\r\n\r\nBetter still, <strong>[[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/AkzidenzGrotesk.html|Akzidenz
    Grotesk]]</strong> traces its geneology to the letterforms of Walbaum, and you
    may have an easier time harmonizing it with Le Corbusier."
