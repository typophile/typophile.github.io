  'Perpetua' springs into mind\r\nIve come up with the following general descriptions:
  classic, light, elegant and somewhat non-specific. If there are any other words
  that spring to mind please share.\r\n\r\nI'm having a little trouble thinking of
  possible songs, instrumental versions or music in general that encapsulates these
  attributes. It's for a 30sec animation on After Effects I'm creating.\r\n\r\nAny
  help at all would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks"

    the recommended songs although very different in terms of rhythm and mood, conjure
    some aspect that is Perpetua.\r\nIll be listening it every suggestion while making
    my animatic.\r\nThank you for the fantastic ideas!\r\nNow the problem is, which
    one do I choose???\r\nI also thought The Beatles 'Here Comes the Sun' would work
    as well.\r\n"

  body: Maxim is heading in the right direction in that it needs to be immediately
    recognisable as distinctly British, but the Pomp and Circumstance March (often
    known as Land of Hope and Glory, although Elgar didn't write or approve the lyrics)
    is too martial for Gill. You want something pastoral. I recommend either part
    of the opening movement of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5C99JyP2ns">Elgar's
    Cello Concerto</a>, or the lyrical middle passage of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6NopU9K_8M'>Jupiter
    from Holst's Planets</a> (the passage I'm thinking of begins about 3:00 minutes
    into that clip). Another possibility in the same vein would be Nimrod from Elgar's
    Enigma Variations, although for many Brits the immediate association of that piece
    is Remembrance Day.

  body: "Well i've decided to go with 'Perpetuum Mobile' about 20sec into the vid.
    Although it isn't recognizably British, the piece has a beautiful rhythm to it.
    \r\nIt's light, elegant, classic and versatile- has great ring to it and I believe
    perfect for my animatic. \r\nI also like the meaning behind the name 'perpetual
    motion...' it's very beautiful and only compliments Perpetua's place in the history
    of typography.\r\nI'd like to thank everyone who offered suggestions.\r\nI hope
    the animatic turns out well.\r\nThanks again :)\r\n"
