  does anybody have any samples of Flexure by Stephen Farrell in use? It doesn&#39;t
  matter if they are old or new, or if they are your work or somebody else&#39;s.  <BR>
  <BR>Links, jpgs, etc. are welcome.  <BR> <BR>If you like, you can upload here or
  if you rather <a href="mailto&amp;#58;speakup&amp;#64;underconsideration&amp;#46;com">e-mail
  me</a>, that&#39;s cool too. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    uses it for their signage. I walked by and remembered this thread. I&#39;ll go
    back with my camera tomorrow and get a picture.
