body: "I am just a kid about to enter school -not really sure what I would like to
  do just yet- I figure it wouldn't be terrible to have a calling card. It also wouldn't
  be terrible to have one that looks sharp, you know, first impressions and all that.
  This is a preliminary design. Tear it apart, just know that my hope for the final
  product includes these words: handsome, clean and simple.\r\nYour input would be
  appreciated. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Card Rough Draft_5084.jpg]"

  body: "What is the name of the serif you used?\r\n\r\nNow for criticism, don't you
    think that everything is just too big. You used whole format, and just filled
    it with large crowns, with pretty large type and pretty narrow margins. What is
    the format of this card you use? Could you post 1:1 version?\r\n_\r\n\r\nSandro"

  body: "<em>... why crowns?</em>\r\n\r\nThree crowns (\"tre kronor\") is the Swedish
    national emblem. This guy is obviously of Swedish ancestry, judging by his slightly
    anglicised name. But I have to say that these crowns are not good for a business
    card. Find or make some much more stylised ones. What's the type?"

  body: "Oh, so sorry about the terrible upload job. ravel, the type is Relato. And
    Satyagraha, good call. Below is a link to the reworked design, this time actually
    in a standard business card size. \r\nI like this second design but I feel, after
    a second look, it might be a little far reaching for a kid in my position. \r\nI
    do not wish to come across as a know-it-all sonofabitch, kid. I want it to be
    courteous and clean.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Business Card Rework copy_5180.jpg]"

  body: "The crowns do not match the type. There are too black in color and styling
    is wrong. If you are going to use Relato I would like to suggest that you pick
    up some of the angles in Relato and use them in the logo/crowns. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    the composistion of the crowns and the text with the regular weight and the bold
    weight feels very corporate\u2014not personal.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, put some contact
    information in your card so we can see how you\u2019ll format that too.\r\n\r\n<em>\u201CI
    do not wish to come across as a know-it-all sonofabitch, kid. I want it to be
    courteous and clean.\u201D</em> Relato is warm yet has some masculine angles in
    there too. Letterpress printing will seriously warm things up too.\r\n\r\nMikey

  body: "Maybe to try with three crowns, different in style? Maybe stylized, as for
    example swedish flag. \r\n\r\nStill, everything is too large, you need to calm
    it down generally and make it more subtle. Print it and you'll se what I am talking
    about. It seems like that your name is currently 1 cm in length. \r\n \r\nWhat
    is the size in cm or in of this card? This what you posted can't be 1:1. It is
    enormous. How much is enlarged?\r\n_\r\n\r\nSandro"

  body: I have to reiterate the critique about the crowns. Their style does not match
    the font you have selected. I understand the symbolism has to do with your ancestry
    but that very ornate heavy style looks pretentious especially for a "simple" business
    card for a kid in school. Try some new designs. instead of clip art draw a cleaner
    more modern crown.

  body: "Mikey, I buy into the look being too corporate; the crowns more of a brand
    than I need for a call card. \r\nSandro, I agree regarding the size of the package,
    I think I got carried away \u2013as you surely know, the computer screen can be
    deceiving sometimes. The canvas size, and what I understand is the typical size
    for a card, is 2 X 3.5 in. \r\nAlso, it is important to understand that I have
    no intention of entering any graphic design field, thus I have no intent to offer,
    to potential employers, a flamboyant or overstated card. Originally I went with
    these crowns because they represent a return to an aged simplicity; a reaction
    to what I see as the all too spiffy and playful designs that frequent blogs like
    <em>Brand New</em>. \r\nI still feel semi attached to the crowns because of this,
    Kirsten, but Im considering something to this effect.\r\n \r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Flygvapnet_roundel.svg\r\n\r\nThe
    only problem I have with these crowns is that they are instantly recognizable
    as a Swedish 'brand' and I don\u2019t want to be taken for an ambassador or something.\r\n\r\nThe
    contact information would be on the back.\r\n\r\nSo is the consensus that an overhaul
    is in order, maybe minus the Relato? How does the Regular \u2013 Bold combo work?
    I am also thinking of switching the name to a very legible fraktur? Thoughts?
    (disregard my heritage on this one folks)\r\n"
