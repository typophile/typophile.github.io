<p>I see the designers posting here of a high level, so who better to ask. Not wanting a poll for posters to do 1 liner posts like: &ldquo;I have&rdquo;, would prefer to read how the over all experience was and if it was worth while. Any issues with fonts, font managers, font caches&hellip;</p>
<p>Wanting to update the studio, and for once have not jumped in head first on this upgrade. thanks in advance.</p>

All of them worked just great, but, sometimes this one intel g5 simply didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;want&rsquo; to print for some reason. When we had a problem like that, we opened the file back in a non-intel machine and it would print just right and easy.
I guess that if you upgrade to Leopard your CS3 suite will work just fine, but, question is: Do you really need (or want) to upgrade?</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am on a PowerMac G5 2*2.5G Hz and have had a fair amount of problems with the CS3 apps, esp. InDesign. Erratic crashes especially when doing stuff in Open, Import, Save dialogs. Using the workarounds that have been found  by smarter people than me, one can cope, but it is a hassle: I have to restart ID often because of sudden disappearances, contain the amount of fonts active, be careful not to drag–and–drop images, and so on.</p>
<p>Word is that Intel-machines behave better, though.</p>
<p>I do feel that the combination PowerMac/Leopard/CS3 is not ideally suited for production work. You’re better of staying on Tiger. Or upgrade to Intel : )</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s the former, then it&rsquo;s no wonder you have problems.  The upgrade process for OS X is quite nice, however, it&rsquo;s not perfect and a huge amount of cruft is still left over to cause problems.  I never upgrade when I install a new OS; I back everything up and do a complete erase and install of the new version.  Start fresh.  It takes longer to get up and running that way but it saves problems in the future.</p>

<p>Both upgrades and erase-and-install installations have been plagued in my experience. The only time I’ve seen it go well was a completely nuke ’n’ pave, i.e., the entire hard drive was formatted (it was a server at work that was being sold off for some reason, so they overwrote it 35 times—best not to leave any valuable information on there) and a clean install was made.</p>
<p>I suspect it has to do with the fact that standard user ids and groups have been changed, but I’m not sure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mili:</p>
<p>Indeed! I remember doing work on a 40 MB hard drive. 16 MHz processor that beast had.</p>
<p>Like you, I’m perfectly content with 10.4.11 on my Mac Pro. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been running CS3 on 10.4 (Tiger) on a MacBook Pro 2.4 Core 2 Duo for months with no problems. I see no reason to update to Leopard, which still has some stability issues (albeit not so bad now that it&rsquo;s been updated to 10.5.2).</p>
<p>However, I think your hardware is more important than your software, in this case. A PowerPC Mac will probably give you trouble that an Intel won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>AGL, why do you recommend against the Intel Macs? They are far, far beyond the PPCs, in terms of power and compatibility with newer apps.</p>

I hope that by the time of the next upgrade that old workhorse won&rsquo;t be needed anymore. FH has been giving me gray hairs lately even with PPC.

<p>I just bought a new imac (2.8 intel duo extreme, 4gigs of ram). The guy told me at the store that 10.5 was somehow optimized for the new processors, and in turn, CS3 is indeed optimized for 10.5.</p>
<p>Something interesting that I didn&rsquo;t know is that InDesign and Illustrator are single-processor aware programs, so a second processor (ie Mac Pro/Power Mac) won&rsquo;t do anything for you in either app(but that&rsquo;s kinda off topic).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ chipman223 &ldquo;AGL, Why on earth do you need classic mode? I’m curious to know what program you’re using.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long long time I had to constantly learn the new software that pops up every 3 months. As a production artist or prepress tech in a printshop you have to know every single piece of c**p that is thrown in the market; secretaries are making flyers and brochures with Publisher; that customer of ours only has his text in WordPerfect; the guy that plotters the lettering only has CorelDraw7; the 20th century graphic designer got to have CS or die! It sure is good to have excellent top notch software and that can be seen on your work, but in my personal case I am locked to with OS9 and Classic, because the legit software that i have is for OS9. Now laugh big time, I am still using Quark 3.32 right out of the floppy discs! Whatever I do can be opened anywhere and RIPs just fine. Even in China. 
Letterpress is very limited business, most of the artwork is vector and, if think screens, you have to think with 60 lpi or less, so any piece of program from the digital Renaissance works just great and allow the making of any TIF cmyk, vector editable eps.
Of course, to surf the web I use Safari, and you would be surprise how Grab and Preview are useful&hellip; combined with AppleWorks 6 ;-)</p>
<p>@concrete:
In the USA some people (like my last supervisor&hellip;) hate Freehand. I guess it is like that because people like Illustrator best. To draw Freehand used to be the best (version 8 and 9). I like illustrator and indesign cs2, but my budget right now is very low and between buying software or lead type, I buy lead.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure why one would need to go to Leopard at this point, if you haven&rsquo;t bought an Intel equipped Mac. As a typographer, is there something inherently better with CS3 and Leopard?</p>
<p>I run a souped up G4 (souped up mainly for the internet and video, not type) and have another G4 with Classic. I have the ability to create Multiple Master instances with Classic and I favor Streamline over Illustrator&rsquo;s Trace, so it often comes in handy for the work I do. Mainly the concern with older computers and software is the ability to port over. With a G4 or even a G3, this is still not a problem.</p>
<p>The speed of a MacPro is great but that really has little to do with typographic needs, especially if we are talking about print. The last great advance in the typographic realm was OT. And, quite frankly, that was nowhere near as earth shattering as PostScript Type I. It&rsquo;s got some bells and whistles, but those have come at some cost; the loss of multiple masters, lack of user control of letterform configuration, etc. If you like your soup canned, great; but how does it taste?</p>

<p>Not necessarily possible.</p>
<p>In many cases (as far as I know, in all cases, actually, but I’m not certain), it’s not possible to install any older version of OS X than what the machine shipped with. If you buy a new Mac now, it should ship with Leopard, in which case you won’t be able to install Tiger on it.</p>

<p>Yes, Oisin, it is possible. I did it on my Mac - I had to re-install the OS and by mistake I installed Panther; actually the Mac had been running on Tiger, which I installed when I noticed what I had done.</p>

<p>At the risk of having a my Mac not functioning properly or not at all, it is a LARGE part of my business&hellip; Leopard is presenting itself as not being stable on G5 2gh dual processor Power PC Macs.. for those wanting to do this, post your results here. based on the said Hardware running CS3.</p>

<p>How odd. I recently changed the hard drive in a brand new MacBook that shipped with Leopard. Afterwards, I wanted to install Tiger instead of Leopard on it, since my friend whose computer it was likes Tiger better than Leopard, too; but when I tried booting from the Tiger install disc, it simply told me that “This operating system cannot be installed on this hardware” (or however that particular message goes).</p>
<p>Something someone said on a Mac forum led me to believe that this was a universal occurrence, that the version the computer originally shipped with was the earliest that could be installed, so I just let it go.</p>
<p>Are you sure your Mac didn’t originally ship with Panther, and you then upgraded it to Tiger afterwards?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is possible to install older OS X versions on your machine with some tweaks (and lots of time) but for a variety of reasons I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it if you were going to use if for production. Leopard was dire when it was released but after 10.5.2 I found it manageable, not much worse than Tiger. Since I&rsquo;m running an Intel Machine, staying with CS2 wasn&rsquo;t really an option, and I&rsquo;m quite happy with the current configuration.</p>
