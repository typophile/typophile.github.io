body: "There is a one day workshop taking place in Toronto, Canada on April 6th from
  9 to 4 pm. It is being put on by the RGD Ontario (the Association of Registered
  Graphic Designers of Ontario). The title is Intro to Glyph Drawing and Type Design
  and focuses on \"the proper techniques for digitally rendering glyphs and the basic
  concepts of digital typeface/font design\". It looks absolutely fabulous and I was
  just told that the event will be cancelled unless there is more interest in it.
  (Personally, I can't imagine why there wouldn't be!) So if you're in the area and
  at all interested: http://www.rgdontario.com/news/events.php#glyphs\r\n\r\nAndrea"
