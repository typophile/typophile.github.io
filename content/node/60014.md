    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ludwiguebele/helsinki/|Helsinki]] and obviously
    DIN.\r\n\r\nPlus, it seems that the type has been rounded slightly or has an additional
    stroke."

    Cultures France <a href=\"http://www.culturesfrance.com/Culturesfrance-mode-d-emploi/pu9.html\"><strong>Resources
    link</strong></a> and click on <strong>T\xE9l\xE9chargez le pdf</strong> (at the
    right of the red pdf logo), you will get a pdf text with a unicolor logo that
    to my eye is made with the same font. You can then enlarge it at will in Acrobat
    and see better.\r\n\r\n"
