    situation and I think most of them will send you the samples you need, no problem.

  body: Tell us more about your project, BTW, Maria. <BR>It&#39;s hard to recommend
    something without knowing more about it. <BR> <BR>Also, notice that Meta is almost
    20 years old &#40;it was originally designed in 1985, IIRC&#41;. Corpid, Spiegel
    and Parisine are more than 5 years old. They aren&#39;t so &#39;new&#39;.

  body: Maria, although you probably won&#39;t get people here just sending you the
    fonts&#42;, many foundries will provide means for people who can&#39;t afford
    to buy all the fonts they admire - which is most people! <BR> <BR>&#42; At least
    I hope not! :-/ Good fonts like those take a lot of work to make and their authors
    want to make money from the effort, and are afraid copies of the fonts will start
    &#34;drifting&#34; to potential customers who will end up not buying them. <BR>
    <BR>And I&#39;d also be curious to find out more about the project itself. <BR>
    <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Maria if you are writing an essay concerned with this topic and you only
    need samples of these fonts, I&#39;m sure you can find PDF samples of them, or
    simple line samples, or perhaps a line of type from the actually designer. You&#39;ll
    have a more difficult time with the larger foundries, but I&#39;d like to think
    the smaller foundries would be able to help. Most foundries have PDF samples of
    the typefaces. You might consider designing your essay around what is available
    for use as preview and not worry about having the actual typeface &#40;if that
    was what you meant in the first place&#41;. <BR> <BR>Without knowing what exactly
    you are doing we are all making blinded suggestions. <BR> <BR>=== <BR> <BR>Nick!
    Ha! You are such a smarty-pants. '
