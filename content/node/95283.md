  Lion.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to manually clear font caches? I have an older version
  of FontExplorer that really doesn't work for clearing either Application or System
  caches. I really just need those for Adobe Illustrator cleared for the moment. \r\n\r\nIs
  there an easy way to clear font caches using Terminal? Does it require restart?\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure when FontNuke will release a compatible version.\r\n\r\nPlease advise.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    current user:\r\n<code>atsutil databases -removeUser</code>\r\n\r\nOr for all
    users and the system:\r\n<code>sudo atsutil databases -remove</code>\r\n\r\nThen
    shutdown and restart ATSServer:\r\n<code>atsutil databases -shutdown\r\natsutil
    databases -ping</code>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIllustrator's font cache is stored at:\r\n<code>~/Library/Application
    Support/Adobe/Adobe Illustrator CS[x]/en_US/IllustratorFnt.lst</code>\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the maintenance utility [[http://www.titanium.free.fr/download.php|Onyx]] has
    been updated for Mountain Lion. The font options are found under Cleaning > Fonts."
