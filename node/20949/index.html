<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi there.
I am not sure if something like this has been posted before, I dont think so so here goes.
I have been working as a graphic designer for around 7 years now and although the job I have is secure and brings in some good clients, due to the size of the company and the clients it has the creative part can be very frustrating. To cut a long story short, which I am sure many of you are aware of, projects can easily become more about the politics and strategic grounding behind a project which can sometimes lead to the creative part becomming less important.
I am now thinking of trying to set up something of my own and although I know what this entails and what hard work, but worth while work it can be there is one thing that I am a little unsure of.
I have always been employed by someone and although I have done many freelance projects along the way, most of my work has been done whilst employed.
My question is, is when I create my folio for my future company is it ok to use the work I have done whilst employed, as long as I credit it to the company I was with at the time.
Has anyone else been in this situation in the past whilst setting their own company up and if so how did you go about it?
Matt</div>

<div class=commentbody>It is normal to sbe able how anything you have done in a portfolio provided you place your role in the work in context. So yeah; it sounds like no problem to me.</div>

If you signed a contract with your previous employer/s you might want to check the small-print or have a lawyer look it over. If you're competing directly against your old employer they might decide to make life difficult for you if they are so inclined.

<div class=commentbody>I agree that it is perfectly fair to show work you've done while employed, as long as you're clear what your role was in the project (i.e. not taking creative credit for someone else's work) and who the client was.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I work for both my own clients and as a subcontractor for advertising agencies. If I have a meeting with a potential client I show in addition of work for my own clients, some of the subcontracted work (unless forbidden, like with medical companies), and always state both my client and their client and what my part in the project was. I also try to avoid any conflict with my agency clients, i.e. I won't steal their customers.
If you were to look for a new job, you would show work you've done whilst working for your current employer. I don't think setting up your own company is much different a situation.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've been on my own for 10 years and just now got around to a web page (which is still very beta). I had to work around this at every turn because I've been stuck under one client for sooo long. It took me a long time to work it out, and I had to be very careful with the language and presentation.
I started a thread, just like you have done. Had some help from Norbert, and some unexpected scepticism as well (see the thread).

That was almost as humiliating as being referred to as an <cite>artiste</cite> by Hrant.

<div class=commentbody>If the work has been produced and used by the client(s), then it is no longer under lock and key. Meaning it's safe to show publically without ruining any marketing plans or strategies.
With that said, you should be okay to use work you've produced even if it's from another company you worked for. So long as you provide credits to the company and the creative/art director, you should probably be safe.
Like others have said, oftentimes it's a good idea to consult a lawyer about these things.

<div class=commentbody>I would suggest asking the company for who you did the work. I know one company I worked for does not allow me to show any work in my portfolio. Lame? Yes! But, they from what I understand, it is within their rights to do so.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for all these comments, it seems like a general feeling that its mostly about crediting the work to the right people and making sure you dont take credit for something you havnt done.
I guess once you get a few clients and a complete a few jobs then these could probably replace the work you have done whilst at another company. I guess it is always useful to have these projects in the folio as it shows the clients where you have come from and the experience you have gained.
I think talking to someone like a lawyer could be a good idea, just to be on the safe side.
Thnks for all the advice guys.

<div class=commentbody>It really depends on the company, the clients, the nature of the work. I'm in book publishing and it's totally ok to take credit for books designed - in fact the books carry a credit. But I know that isn't the case with other types of clients.
Good luck with your own business. Striking out on my own was the best decision I've ever made for myself but I gotta warn you, while you may not have to deal with interoffice powerplays and politics you get a whole other set of issues and you have to make nicey nice to a lot of people you wish you could tell to eat s**t. Unless you hire an assistant for that...</div>
