    blue layer and control the amount of texture using a layer mask. '

  body: Guest, the best way to make the distressed look would be to add a layer mask
    and mask the etched areas. You do this so you can change your mind. Other wise
    use a small eraser and add a drop shadow layer effect. The effect around the Balloon
    is a outer glow layer effect.
