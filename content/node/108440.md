  be in XML Format and also an RTF file is given with same content, what we do currently
  is copy and paste the text in InDesign document and start formatting te content
  accordingly. But we are having huge volumes like more than 6000 pages and similarly
  we are having 8-12 vilumes, i want to know if we can get the styles directly in
  InDesign and start working on  them.\r\n \r\nFor eg: we have the below content\r\n
  \r\n<para style=\"left\"><num style=\"bold\">1(1)</num>   <b>[Short title and commencement]</b></para>\r\n
  \r\nHere there should be a para created and the number should be bold. I'm really
  unable to understand how to do it. please help me with this. And also our vendors
  need the IDML file along with the PDF. please let me know how i can do this.\r\nAlso
  please suggest me some good tutorials regarding this.\r\n \r\nThanks."

    panel</strong> within InDesign, and the delights of scripting. Maybe hiring a
    consultant would save you so many hours that in the long run, you'd save a lot
    money...maybe not. \r\n\r\nAnd no, I'm not offering services, I speak rather as
    one who has taken advantage of them. Our conversion time for manuscripts dropped
    dramatically after my business partner did this kind of work. "
