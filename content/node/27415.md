  font editor, AsiaFont Studio. I gather it's a high-end version of FontLab with features
  that come handy for dealing with CJK font.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, I would like
  to create fonts with Hangul (Korean alphabet) support. However, the $1,999 price
  tag is rather prohibitive. Is there anyone who has used AsiaFont Studio, preferably
  with an Asian script, that could tell me whether it would be worth blowing my annual
  budget on it?\r\n\r\nI know about the ability to support something like 65,000+
  glyphs at once. But just how much of an improvement is it over the method of working
  on several smaller files separately using FontLab or other font editors then combining
  them at the end? I'd appreciate any opinions from those who have used this program."

    into a larger one, simply because FontLab [Studio] will not output fonts with
    more than 6,400 glyphs. \r\n\r\nAsiaFont Studio 4 is functionally equivalent to
    FontLab 4.5 plus it has support for reading CID-keyed Type 1 fonts, reading and
    creating TrueType collections, supporting fonts with more than 6,400 glyphs. \r\n\r\nAsiaFont
    Studio 5 is under development. It will be functionally equivalent to FontLab Studio
    5, plus it will have some additional features such as improved Change weight and
    Clean up paths algorithms, CID-keyed Type 1 and OpenType import and export, support
    for vertical glyph metrics, support for non-BMP (5-digit) Unicode codepoints etc.
    We don\u2019t have yet a precise release date or pricing information, but I\u2019m
    sure there will be an upgrade path for both AsiaFont Studio 4 and FontLab Studio
    5 users. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"
