  body: "It has been noted several times in the past that the Typophile search box
    is not working properly, since a few years now. Best method to search Typophile
    currently still seems to be using Google and adding 'site:typophile.com' to your
    search request.\r\n\r\nFor example: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=typophile+search+site%3Atypophile.com&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq=\"
    target=\"_blank\">typophile search site:typophile.com</a> / <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=pairing+site%3Atypophile.com&btnG=Search\"
    target=\"_blank\">pairing site:typophile.com</a>."

    I couldn't search for the answer to my question :)\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice,
    it is duly noted. Maybe this or a previous topic could be made a sticky, as I
    looked for it there too. "

  body: "Yes, the search is indeed broken. I have added a bookmark to my browser with
    a piece of javascript coding someone on the forum wrote (I forgot who) which you
    can use to search Typophile via Google with a little pop-up window.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone wants to have that, say so and I will post the code here."

  body: Does not work for me, but that could be me, not the script ... at the first
    glance, SmartyPants substituted apostrophes and double curly quotes for the single
    and double straight quotes in the script. Would it work like that?

  body: "Oh, yes, you\u2019re right: all quotes should be single and straight. No
    double quotes involved. Thanks for the heads-up."

  body: "I think using the code tags will keep the original characters and quotes?\r\n\r\n<code>javascript:void(q=prompt('Search%20Typophile:',''));if(q)void(location.href='http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com'+'%20'+escape(q))</code>\r\n\r\nLooks
    to me like it does. :)"

    Apologies for leaving it broken for so long. Some bugs are more tenacious than
    others.\r\n"
