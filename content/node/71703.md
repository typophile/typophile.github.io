    extenders.\r\nPerhaps this was mentioned in the missing thread."

    could clarify because this is something I can definitely use in the future.\r\n\r\nI
    ended up using Giovanni, 9.25/14 tracked -3 in InDesign. \r\n\r\nThanks so much-Janet"

  body: "These variables all interact as to how comfortable a read the text is: x-height,
    length of extenders, how wide the set it (how long a lower case alphabet is),
    the leading, the measure (width of column). And also how light or dark the text
    is. And margins. \r\n\r\nJudging by what people actually do, when they have a
    little more space they go for the purportedly ideal measure for a single column--2
    1/2 lc alphabets, and adjust the leading according to the typeface. That's for
    books. \r\n\r\nIn magazines, and more so newspapers, they tend to go not for the
    narrowest typeface, but rather for a large x-height, short extenders, and relatively
    little leading in narrow columns. That seems to be the way to stuff a lot of text
    on the page. \r\n\r\nOf course there's a lot more to a choice, but you get the
    idea: you can gain in one department and lose in another, so it's a balancing
    act on economy, readability, and getting the look you want. "

  body: "Nick-it was a 460 page book, initially coming in at over 500 pages. I needed
    the leading with a book that long. Now that I'm reading flooce's suggestion, I
    understand what you mean. Thanks flooce-this makes a lot of sense. I honestly
    never considered the x-height which is a pretty ridiculous oversite, but this
    is why I love typophile! \r\n\r\nThanks Arno-it's worth a try!\r\n\r\nAnd thank
    you William. I'm doing a book presently that has all of these factors-regular
    text, sidebars, small columns, etc. You information is very useful at this time.
    \r\n\r\nThanks to all for sticking with this one,\r\nJanet"
