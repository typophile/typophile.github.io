body: Heinrich Wieynck&#39;s magnificent Kanzlei is embedded <a href="http://www.systemarchitektur.de/stempel/ChronikStempel.pdf">here</a>
  &#40;page 8&#41; and <a href="http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Wieynck/HWieynck.pdf">here</a>
  &#40;top&#41;, but neither gives any info as to who&#39;s selling the digital version
  today. I&#39;ve checked all the usual suspects, and none of them seem to have it.
  I wrote the both the Stempel guy and the Klingspor Museum but got no response from
  either. In both PDFs it&#39;s embedded simply as &#34;Wieynckanz.&#34; <BR> <BR>Any
  information about who sells it would be appreciated.
