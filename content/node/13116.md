body: "Basically, why does what is illustrated in the attachment happen sometimes?
  Making a new weight should be simplified by something that will expand an outline
  by a set number of units, not complicated. There's still so much to do to create
  a true bold, cleaning up unasked for points is a time waster. I figure I'm doing
  something wrong or else it wouldn't need to generate these points (and sometime
  seperate contours). See attached gif to make sense of this.\r\nThanks"

  body: "I've noticed this a lot, and I'm not really sure why it happens.  I had assumed
    it was probably just the kind of thing you should expect from an automatic process
    like this.\r\n\r\nYou may still want to split that point, though.  Notice that
    the lower handle is below the other handle on the right (and probably the point
    to which it belongs).  Adding a point somewhere in the middle should prevent this
    and allow you to retain basically the same curve.  I don't have any idea if that
    will have any effect on the autobold, though."

  body: Check the connection <strong>before</strong> bolding to see if it's smooth.
    If it's not, make it a smooth connection, and that <strong>ought</strong> to fix
    the problem. If it doesn't, FontLab has a problem with its math...

  body: I think fontlab has a problem with its math, I mean it was a smooth connection,
    thats what the little circle thingy means, isn't it?

  body: It's possible that you could have two overlapping points there.  Try merging
    overlaps before using the autobold.

  body: Hmmm...I started a similar thread a while back. What is the right way to go
    about it, redrawing your bolds manually, or tweaking Fontlab's auto bold feature?
    Are both acceptable?

  body: "Well, there's never really one right way, is there? :)\r\nI've never been
    entirely happy with the auto bold, but I haven't used it much.  I don't see anything
    wrong with using it as long as the design works in the end.  It may take some
    tweaking to achieve what you want, though.\r\n\r\nI remember reading a site with
    some suggestions on how to create bolds, but I can't seem to find the address
    now."
