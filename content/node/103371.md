  of information about Germany and England on Google, but France never shows up.\r\n\r\nCan
  someone here point me in the right direction ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nL.\r\n\r\nBTW :

  body: "A short and [over-]simple history: In the first half of the 20th century
    French type was dominated by Deberny & Peignot (with Charles Peignot shifting
    the foundry from text type to display type). After WWII the Olive foundry became
    big, thanks in large part to Roger Excoffon's graphic bravado.* After that there
    was a dark ages of sorts, although there were some French individuals designing
    great type (like Ladislas Mandel and Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida - perhaps telling
    not native Frenchmen however). In the digital age the champion of French type
    design has been Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez, although we have a number of great rising
    talents now, such as Christophe Badani.\r\n\r\n* Two highly recommended recent
    books on Excoffon:\r\nhttp://ypsilonediteur.com/fiche.php?id=95\r\nhttp://www.adverbum.fr/roger-excoffon-rault-david-atelier-perrousseaux_ouvrage-perrousseaux_4itkob6k386b.html

      looks great !\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nL.\r\n\r\nBTW, I believe that Jean Fran\xE7ois
      Porchez and Christophe Badani can be considered as 21st century designers.\r\n;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
