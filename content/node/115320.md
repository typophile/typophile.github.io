  body: "Thanks all :)\r\n\r\nhrant, Once it gets included in GF, you will get the
    hinted TTF files delivered to your PC browser. The ones in the testing specimen
    are not even Woff files, just the full desktop OTF files linked directly in the
    CSS.\r\n<img src=\"http://cl.ly/image/2S0F3Q25382x/Screen%20Shot%202014-03-29%20at%2018.09.29.png\"

  body: "Tanks Renko!\r\n\r\nWow Mike, that's quite a compliment coming from someone
    with your hinting knowledge!\r\nI assume you are talking about the downloadable
    TTF files, right? (The specimen are OTF). It's was done with the latest release
    of TTF Autohint, version 1.0. The parameters used are included in the Font Info.\r\n"
