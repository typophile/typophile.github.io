  tags\u2026\r\n\r\nWhat's all the fuss about \"saving the i-dot in Turkish\", the
  Servo-Bulgarian ghe's, excepting ligatures in German, Moldavo-Romanian S's with
  comma-accents, Polish diacritics, and so on and so on, if the industry's major typesetting
  program doesn't support language system tags?\r\n\r\nHow on earth is it possible
  Adobe ships full-featured OpenType fonts that claim to have multilingual support,
  but at the same time doesn't manage to implement this more than indispensable OT
  spec in their state-of-the-art layout program, and so for over a decade since the
  OT format was defined?\r\n\r\nLack of support for LookupTypes is one thing\u2014-
  but this?"

  body: "Paul \u2014 All right. But it was quite disenchanting a surprise to me, to
    learn the industry's OT-savviest application doesn't support one of OpenType's
    imho most indispensable attributes yet. I took this for granted, since all the
    documentation on OT discusses language systems specific rules at length, Adobe
    people are giving talks about it at ATypI, and, not in the least, because Adobe
    ships Pro fonts that, for years now, are equipped with language specific substitution
    exceptions. Also, I fear that support for language system tags is not on InDesign
    developers' priority list, which would explain why they didn't take care of this
    quite simple (?) upgrade thus far. After all, it's like about over a decade now,
    since the OT format was designed. I imagine at the moment the InDesign team are
    already busy enough with porting InDesign to the new MacIntel, which adds to my
    apprehension of lacking OT language support in InDesign releases in the near future,
    let alone the next one."

    is by no means quite simple. \r\n\r\n2. Nonetheless, applications are easier upgraded
    than fonts. Once a font is released to the public, it's difficult to make fixes
    because you introduce the possibility of incompatible versions with an identical
    name floating around. \r\n\r\n3. InDesign is a huge project, an application written
    from scratch. Each version adds more typographic refinement but obviously, it's
    impossible to do everything at once. But my guess is that script- and language-specific
    OpenType processing is on the developers' priority list. \r\n\r\n4. Very simply,
    never take anything for granted. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Miguel \u2014 Thanks for the info. But what do you mean by 'improved'? Either
    language tags are supported, or they are not. At the moment they are not, in InDesign
    CS2.\r\n\r\nWhat's so difficult? The user can specify which language applies to
    what string of text already, so that the program is able to use the proper dictionary
    (for hyphenation and spell check). Using this information, the OT engine could
    easily look for language tags in the font and apply the associated lookups. Obviously,
    the tags used by the app should match the OT tags, but I can't imagine Adobe failing
    to have consistent tag naming conventions."
