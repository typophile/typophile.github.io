  and I thought I would jump on here and see if I can get any suggestions.\r\n\r\nI'm
  a graduate of Graphic Design from the Art Institute of Vancouver where they cover
  typography, but I have such a great interest that I wanted to persue it further.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would greatly help.\r\n\r\nThanks,"
