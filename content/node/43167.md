  body: "Thomas, I think the Trade Gothic suggestion was very close. This almost looks
    like it is a customized version of it (Trade Gothic). The 'e' is the biggest difference,
    and the 'y' tail isn't the same, but otherwise it's very close, I think. I didn't
    see anything closer in my searching.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "You're right Jan, but doesn't it almost look like you can see where the stem
    was lopped off? Now I feel even stronger that this is an altered version of Trade
    Gothic.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
