body: "I have been looking for a sufficiently cold-looking OT grotesque sans in a
  Swiss vein with all the goodies needed for proper typography, so  far without success.
  There are OpenType versions of Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk and Linotype Helvetica
  Neue, but neither of these have small caps or text figures, except the A-G which
  only has the light weight. I suspect the Helvetica Neue OT is a straight translation
  from the PS version and has no new typographic features. I emailed Berthold, but
  they didn't mention anything about producing other weights with small caps and text
  figures, and instead pointed me towards Imago Pro, which doesn't really do the trick.
  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if such a font as I have described exists? I would think
  that Font Shop would have something like this, but most of their typographic sans
  are humanist, and the ones that come close look more like Gotham. I seek something
  with a cold, blank, scientific stare that functions like a Swiss army knife."

  body: You could take a look of my Tang family at www.type.fi. It's not as neutral
    as Helvetica et. al., but it does have Roman, Italic and SC in 7 weights...

  body: Hmm. Everything looks too friendly. Hopefully someone will make a multi-weight
    A-G or Helvetica with SC/OsF. Keep your fingers crossed. Thanks everyone for your
    help. If you see something, please give me a shout.

  body: It's the numbers, they don't appear to match the letters. They seem a bit
    calligraphic.
