  body: Ah, I see. Thanks, Florian. (And speaking of Sabon, I suppose that <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?F5">Sabon
    Next</a> does not qualify, even though it builds on the original design.)

    mine are preparing a small exhibition on Jan Tschichold in the Dutch Graphic Design
    Museum in the city of Breda (opening end of February). They wondered if there
    were any of the Tschichold typefaces digititally available. They knew about the
    Sabon. I'll check also with David Quay of the Foundry for what else he'd know.
    Thanks,\r\n\r\nMax"

    from ATypI 2002 which I find interesting ; apparently Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez
    tried to bring back the Stempel version and come back to the roots of the Stempel
    version as well : <cite>\"This version is a careful revival of Garamond, however
    it is not a Garamond itself.\"</cite>\r\nThis <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/19300\">thread</a>
