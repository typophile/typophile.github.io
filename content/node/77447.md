body: "I just wanted to ask, if the Bitstream license allows to use Charter Pro as
  webfont. But then I saw, that I meanwhile <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/charter-bt-pro/roman/buy.html\">can
  license it as webfont</a>. This is so great. It is better legible than Georgia in
  my opinion. The hinting is excellent. I am really happy now.\r\n\r\nBut can someone
  tell me, if the regular version and the webfont version is the same? Or is only
  the license different?\r\n\r\nAny arguments against using it as webfont?\r\n\r\nAnd
  I would like to split it in a regular and a small cap version. But this does not
  seem to be allowed.\r\n\r\nOkay, I could also license the standard version, but
  the small cap font does not contain capitals. And the hinting of the standard version
  is different from the pro version. It is ridiculous. I am willing to spend money.
  I am willing to invest work in making the webfont usable with regard to Unicode.
  But I am not allowed to decompile/modify it. And in case of Charter it is especially
  ridiculous, because the old Type 1 version is for free."

    license, is free, and can be modified. It is also very good, I've used it for
    bookwork after adding old-style figures, kerning, and a bit of other work. You
    might give it a try, as long as you can do some work yourself.\r\n\r\nI'll allow
    I don't know about the hinting."

  body: The hinting of Charter is better. Charis is no alternative for me. As I said,
    even the hinting of the standard TrueType version of Charter is different from
    the TrueType pro version.

  body: I don't know about the difference between desktop and web versions, but it's
    my understanding that the ITC Charter at webfonts.fonts.com is auto hinted. Have
    you tested it on XP without ClearType? They really ought to hand hint it. So much
    potential on screen. Could be best Georgia replacement yet.

  body: Charis has a slightly larger x-height than Charter and comes off a bit bolder-looking
    onscreen, but just a bit.

    what? What's the performance criteria? What's \"poor\" about it? What version
    of \"Charis\" are you looking at?\r\nNot peckin a fight - I'm just not seeing
    a problem."

  body: I don't have time at the moment to generate and post a screenshot (maybe you
    could for us?) but from what I saw when I was researching candidates for <a href="typedia.com/blog/post/cure-for-the-common-webfont-part-2-alternatives-to-georgia/">this
    piece</a> Charis didn't meet the standard of most Typophile users.

  body: "Stephen,\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the current download package for Charis,
    you are absolutely correct. Too many glaring defects in the hinting. I was looking
    at my own hand-massaged, subsetted, and rehinted version of Charis which is quite
    comparable to Charter, so yeah, you're right.\r\n\r\nrich\r\n"
