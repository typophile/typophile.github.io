    any idea what this is for:\r\n- I quite like how you have drawn the \"ksg\" (focus
    on that)\r\n- don't like the overpowering stroke (loose it, why is there a stroke
    in the first place?)\r\n- not sure the \"k\" needs such a dominant entry stroke\r\n\r\n"

    use it for his watermark, website and business card. I wanted to create an italic
    script kind of feeling but with broken angles."

  body: IMO the 's' doesn't look italic at all and look more like a sort of strange
    'A'. I like the idea of a angled italic logo, but i think you should rework a
    little your letters, mostly the 'k' and 's'. Anyway, keep the faith, this is promising.

  body: "I prefer the first one still. What if instead of a rounded stroke around
    the outside you had a straight one? Right now it kinda looks a little weird to
    have the hard edged inner stroke surrounded by the curved outer stroke. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    your \"s\" does need some work to make it more legible. The right side curve I
    think is what needs the most work. Instead of a straight line down to the point
    as you currently have it, make it have one or two kinks in it to look more curved.

  body: Even if there's not, it <em>feels</em> like there's a downward slope from
    left to right (likely because of the variation of height of each letterform).
    I find it very unsettling.
