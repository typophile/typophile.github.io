  body: "it is called \"Typ1451\" by Lineto. It's a great typeface and I think it
    is fairly versatile. This font is also used in the book \"Logo\" by Michael Evamy.
    Design firm: Spin. Just thought I would mention that since this font is used for
    the main body of text, so if you have the book you can take a better look at it.
