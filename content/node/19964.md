  body: can someone explain to me the strange thread title?  i see this a lot, and
    am wondering if i am ignoring some sort of naming convention, or if this is just
    something that SuperUltraFabulous does to distinguish her threads.

  body: "at Track & Kern: The thread-titles here are altered by the \"cleaning staff\"
    aka Moderators. First because \"What font is this?\" is no appropriate title for
    the archives. So the title is changed to something useful like \"J-Crew headline\"*.
    And then, when some member ID'd the requested font he gets the credits like \"Joanna
    {Yves}\" (Joanna is the fontname, Yves the IDer). So when the case is closed it
    gets an (x) at the beginning. \r\n\r\nThank you dear cleaning staff, makes it
    so much easier here. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Sorry SuperUltraFabulous, wasn't meant to insult,
    it was just meant as an example. Just to clear some things for Track & Kern"

    name, as it was called <em>\"J-Crew Headlines\"</em>, which is perfect for us
    to recognise the thread in the list. Thanks for making our lives easier, Mike.

  body: lol...seems I forgot to check this thread for a response. I know nothing about
    web stuff, so the organization thing made no sense to me at first, but now, surely
    it does.
