  body: 'Beauclair, did you find that prior thread using the search tool? I''m asking
    this because search doesn''t seem to work for me anymore.  I always get a page
    not found. There''s then a search field on that page that gives me no returned
    results. I even tried searching using the term "serif" and got no results. '

    to a web search.

  body: "riccardO is spot on. If you have the Google Toolbar (or Googlebar Lite in
    FF) type in your search term and click on the \"search this site\" button.\r\n\r\nNow
    that we've \"improved\" the site with gray balls, red balls, and flaming red balls
    with no legend, and we have people bypassing the homepage because it is a waste
    of time and so crappy, here's yet another workaround -- for a search that doesn't
    search. "

    when 99% of all posts on 99% of all pages had the same bullet.\r\n\r\nBut alas,
    edit doesn't seem to be working at the moment.\r\n\r\nAh, progress."
