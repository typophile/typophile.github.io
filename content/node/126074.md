  with a sign declaring in English or French (I forgot) The Four Duncans Museum. They
  were four sibling the most famous being Isadora Duncan the dancer. I just found
  out about Raymond Duncan 1874-1966, who immersed himself in ancient Greek culture,
  and the interest here is that he created his own typeface to print his own books.\r\nOrson
  Welles interviewed him here:\r\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3gdwi3\r\nMore
  about Raymond Duncan's amazing life and work:\r\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Duncan\r\nAnything
  about this eccentric polymath's typeface, quality examples of printed pages and
  critical discussion would be interesting.\r\nVladimir"
