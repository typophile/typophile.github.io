  body: Perhaps if you can tell us more about how you will use the images and what
    (in the images) you are looking for, we might be able to point you in the right
    direction...

  body: "Hi Nicole,\r\n\r\nWell...in my long curve of typeface design I've been developing
    a typeface called Amarantino. More info [[http://typophile.com/node/51795|here.]]\r\nNow
    I'm struggle with some letters in my bold :). \r\nI always look how good designers
    solve some problems. So after the usual suspects and after watching your and Eric
    Olson class  [[http://channel.walkerart.org/detail.wac?id=4977|here]] I discover
    Process Type Foundry! And them I found [[http://www.processtypefoundry.com/custom/sunday.html|this.]]
    Very similar to my Amarantino.\r\nThem I decided to look closer to the font (bold)
    in order to understand (learn?) how you solve the \"y\", \"w\" \"g\" and so on.\r\nThe
    images uses will be for learning purposes :)\r\nThanks and congratulations on
    your and Eric work.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"
