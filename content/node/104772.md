  direct me to sources where it has been answered before): I\u2019m wondering how
  it comes that type and placement of quotation marks vary so much between languages
  and countries. With a few little exceptions (dashes, potentially ellipses, and such),
  we don\u2019t see this kind of crazy diversity with other punctuation (speaking
  within Latin here). So why quotes?"

    to develop or formalize (sometime in the seventeenth century, I believe), much
    later than the period, comma, semicolon, colon, question mark, et al. \r\n\r\nSo,
    I would guess that the lack of a single standardized convention prior to the spread
    of printing would have left open the opportunity for different national centers
    of printing to adapt and evolve different conventions. "

    may have some truth when there is an established solution to be adopted. But my
    whole point is that by the time you have the rival national printing centers of
    the 1600s, each backed by either royal or religious authority, there still was
    no established convention for quotation marks to be borrowed or adopted. \r\n\r\nAt
    the same time, the different customs did not develop in isolation, and I don\u2019t

    multiple solutions evolving more or less simultaneously within strong, rival traditions,
    you end up with several surviving, parallel conventions. Unlike more basic punctuation

    my hypothesis anyway.\r\n\r\nBTW, all you grad students, this would be an interesting

    to identify proto styles and early examples of the emerging norms in the different

    \u2014 Forgive me, but there\u2019s something about this anecdote that strikes
    me as slightly incredible. Do you mean to say that four years on after the original
    release of the Fournier revival in 1925 by the English Monotype company, they
    still had not furnished the fonts with conventional English quotation marks? Or
    perhaps just not for the American market? I sincerely doubt they would have been
    that purist and impractical.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the sample of Monotype Fournier that
    is tipped in to <em>The Fleuron</em> No. V  (1926) has a passage with perfectly
    ordinary English quotation marks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FleuronV-FournierSample_580_6644.jpg]\r\n\r\nPerhaps

  body: "I have found that the idea of using diacritics to quote is very old. Isidore
    of Seville (6th c.) mentions more than twenty forms of quotation, each one of
    them associated with a particular sign. I don\u2019t think that the answer to
    Nina\u2019s question relies on a late-evolution principle, because, somehow, the
    evolution of the quotation marks seems to be more straightforward than, let\u2019s
    say, that of the comma or the semicolon. Semicolons, for instance, were still
    mainly abbreviation marks (for \u2013us, among other Latin suffixes) during the
    16th century.\r\n\r\nThe 66 99-style quotation marks evolved from the ordinary
    comma. Printers used to mark quotations by means of starting each line with a
    couple of commas followed by a fixed space. They were confident that context would
    provide clues for the reader to know the precise places were a quotation started
    and ended. (According to Uribe Echeverr\xEDa and others, this custom derives from
    the early-medieval diple, a wedge-like sign that some scribes wrote at the margins
    of the manuscripts to mark quotations.) Later on, some printers started to insert
    a couple of commas in the precise place where the quotation began, but to differentiate
    them from regular commas, they used to put them upturned in the galley. That is
    why they are inverted (66) with respect to the commas and raised with respect
    to the baseline. Soon, typographers envisioned that a new sign should be engraved
    (99) to join in a couple that would render much better typographic compositions.\r\n\r\nThe
    solution was good in terms of diacritics, though it was obvious that the new quotation
    marks (\u201C \u201D) were ugly. During the 18th century, printers in Europe started
    to lower down the signs and to draw them in a slightly different fashion, curved
    at first, like tiny parenthesis, and later, angled (\xAB \xBB). Almost every typographic
    culture in Europe enthusiastically adopted these new quotation marks. The question
    is why that didn\u2019t happen in England and the United States.\r\n\r\nMy theory
    is that the explanation lies in politics. The United States started a rebellion
    at the end of the 18th century, and from then on, they had no recess until the
    last third of the following century. During this time, they developed as the only
    big nation of the world that grew richer, stronger, and more powerful than their
    former rulers. Surviving and growing at a fast rate was a priority, and that originated
    a lack of leadership in some cultural-related things. Think on Spanish, French,
    and Portuguese, for instance, languages that until recently were (or still are)
    fully regulated by their original countries. English and English culture had a
    different course. Therefore, many of the novelties that Europe adopted during
    the 18th and 19th centuries didn\u2019t flourish in the United States or England:
    Metrical Systemis just another example. Regardless of typographic and literary
    styles, an English book of the 18th century is almost identical to one recently
    printed \u2013 the very same signs used in the very same fashion.\r\n\r\nIn my
    humble opinion, compared to other European major languages, English typographic
    style (orthotypography) is very archaic, and quotation marks are the best reminders
    of the fact.\r\n"

  body: I think that shape should not be discussed independently of spacing and kerning.
    The French guilllemet is vertically centered (and appears to have had approximately
    that position since 1530 if the cuts of the Imprimerie nationale are faithful
    to the original) and there is a thin space separating each of them from the quoted
    text. On the other hand, English double quotes are on the contrary often kerned
    to get closer to the quoted text. It is rather clear that the guillemet does not
    have an ideal position or shape for such kerning. In fact, since the 19th century,
    spacing in English texts has been reduced, in my opinion, to the bare minimum.
    Is it just for economic reasons? Whatever the answer, I wonder if the move towards
    reading on the screen will change the relevant parameters.

    factor that drove England to differences, is economy, we just followed. Take no

    in the mid-19th century is hardly surprising to economic theory. \r\n\r\nI'm agreeing
    that English-speaking countries had the least politically centralized control
