  and maybe some paper commercial works (reselling design).\r\n\r\nI might also use
  \"Blur\" on the T-shirts.\r\n\r\nIs buying a font type enough for this?\r\n\r\nDoes
  a customer need some license as well?\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\ns"

    you want to do, but read it anyway.

    this license everything you want to do would be fine. However, you should read
    through the license carefully first, as if you end up distributing the fonts through
    digital embedding or bundling you will need to include the license in some form
    to accompany the fonts."

  body: Nick, I like iso-metrix-nf, particularly the accented characters, for some
    reason I am very drawn to the uc 'Z' with acute. It could make a very nice set
    of flash cards.

  body: "Karl\u2014\r\n\r\nI have a note in with the folks at Fontspring. I would
    like for them to assume control of webfont and embedding rights to my entire collection,
    based on a somewhat different pricing model, especially where embedding is concerned.\r\n\r\nTo
    my mind, it only makes sense to have embedding licensing fees tied to actual usage,
    as a fixed percentage of the retail price of the end product, no matter what it
    might be: eBook, video game, or any other kind of virtual product for sale. My
    initial thought is 2.5% of the retail purchase price, payable to the font author
    at time of purchase. In fact, an eBook publishing service\u2014tying together
    font choice, document prep, publishing to various formats, and promotion considerations,
    all totaling no more than the standard literary agent fee of 10%\u2014might be
    another adjunct to the iLUVfonts package, currently under development\u2026\r\n\r\nJeez:
    I just love my new Mr Coffee Keurig-style brewer; however, I am somewhat reluctant
    to have a third cup this morning\u2026"

  body: As much as I have discussed this with copyright holders the perspective on
    why to charge and how much is tied to so many different reasons and usually dependant
    on foundry or developer specific ideas about the technology utilising their fonts.
    With ebooks there are a lot of technical issues associated with the security of
    embedding and this is a key issue for a lot of people.

  body: "Karl\u2014\r\n\r\nSo, buy a license and make the flashcards: such use is
    covered in the basic EULA.\r\n\r\nI know that embedding has lots of issues; that's
    why I have asked Fontspring to handle webfonts and, ultimately, embedded solutions.
    Of course, they may have taken the day off, since today IS a national holiday.
    Maybe Tuesday, the good folks there and I can discuss the options at greater length."
