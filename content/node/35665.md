  that lists your name in the "My account" section, or that says "Submit Forum topic"
  in the Submit Forum topic menu, you know.

    and I are seeing. He sure as heck isn't someone who's going to make a mistake
    about Verdana.\r\n\r\nAlso - not so straight forward to find the font in that
    CSS."

    wierd - I editd my 1rst response to make it a bit clearer, and it went out of

  body: That is the featured font right now. It was designed by one of the Typophile
    members. I don't know how often, but I think I heard they will rotate different
    fonts in those headings. I'm guessing fonts designed by Typophile members.

    its name was.\r\n\r\nAt first, after clicking the featured font link, I didn't
    initially think it WAS Beorcana but have now compared a sample of the font on
    the fonts.com website (try before you buy) and am confident that it is the featured
    font.  Carl Crossgrove has designed a beautiful graceful font.\r\n\r\nWhite Knight"

    you'd be asking about Beorcana given the banner that appears on every page.

  body: "Here's a tip for identifying a font that you suspect is being SIFR'd onto
    the page. If you use FireFox with the adblock extension, click on the adblock
    button in your browser to load a list of all the adblock-able scripts, objects,
    and images in use on the page. (The idea is that you can use one to create a filter
    for excluding content originating from servers you don't like).\r\n\r\nWhen you
    use SIFR, it's common practice (though I don't think it's required) to name the
    Flash SWF file after the font it contains. So when you load the adblock list,
    look for a file ending in .swf with \"object\" category that has a font-like name.
    In this case, it's beorcana_titling_medium.swf.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can
    always view source and hunt for \".swf\".\r\n\r\nEDIT: Actually, just viewing
    source probably won't work since SIFR now pulls in the entire object/embed code
    via javascript. You'd have to \"view generated source\" or work your way through
    the DOM inspector.\r\n\r\nhth\r\n"
