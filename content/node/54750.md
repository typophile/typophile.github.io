  while I'm on downtime at work. I was wondering if I could get people's opinions.
  I'm in many minds about the 'w' and I'm not entirely sure about the 'm' either.
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/warm_6677.gif]\r\n\r\nWould love to
  hear what you think. \r\n\r\nthanks, \r\n\r\nGraham"

    counters will be too small to use below about 16 pt.\r\nBut back to your question
    about the <strong>w</strong>: The letters in this sample have details that are
    slightly off-balance, asymmetrical, but they all square up at the baseline. The
    <strong>w</strong> in example #3 is most simpatico with that style."

  body: "Good points, thanks.\r\n\r\nIt was going to be for a section head for the
    magazine I work for, (UK) Runner's World, and will be at least 16 point. To be
    honest, I was just bored and want to try and find any excuse to draw letters right
    now, so just started sketching, with the aims of something display size."
