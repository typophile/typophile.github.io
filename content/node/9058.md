body: I imagine that many of these exist, but I need <b>proportional &#40;lower case&#41;
  numbers</b> for a letterhead I&#39;m designing. Does anyone know a common sans type
  family that has these? Thanks.

    px x 60 px picture to display properly. Are there size-of-file restrictions that
    I should know about? The <b>Help</b> section doesn&#39;t seem to have anything
    about this problem. Thanks.'

  body: Yes, but that thread doesn&#39;t differentiate proportional OSF.

  body: I would guess the lion&#39;s share of OSF fonts are proportional.

  body: Well, majority anyway. There are a fair number of faces from one big foundry
    &#40;Lino? Mono?&#41; that have tabular OsF, as I recall. <BR> <BR>The other thing
    about that thread is that it only counts typefaces that also have small caps.
    Again, most have both, but one can think of some &#40;e.g. Myriad Pro&#41; that
    only have OsF. <BR> <BR>T

  body: And a very annoying limitation it is. Thomas, is there any chance that Adobe
    might add smallcaps to Myriad Pro?

    that have tabular OsF, as I recall. <BR> <BR>I always put tabular OSF in my typefaces:
    if you&#39;re designing a new typeface, why not? It reduces unnecessary fonts.
    No need to follow the serif model. <BR> <BR>The &#34;one&#34; in most proportional
    sans OSF is slight; a wider form of the glyph, with pronounced serif&#40;s&#41;,
    is more distinctive. However, I will admit that proportional OSF may integrate
    better into U&amp;lc text, in some weights of certain sans faces &#40;the lc being
    proportional&#41;, but the little &#34;one&#34; is still problematic. <BR> <BR>Also
    helpful in achieving even color in a sans OSF: an extra &#34;serif&#34; at the
    top left of the &#34;7&#34; improves fit. <BR> <BR>These features are both in
    Fontesque Sans, and Preface.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/64629.jpg"
