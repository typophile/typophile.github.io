body: How's it progressing? Is it being built or still in the planning stages? Can
  we see screenshots? What's it going to be called? Is it going to run on Air, HTML
  5? Is there a chance it'll be released before 2011? New features? Features removed?

    concepts. Much of the work that we''ve done in the last year for Fontographer
    5 will get folded into FontLab Studio 6. We don''t have a release deadline for
    FLS6 yet, nor a finalized feature list, though. '
