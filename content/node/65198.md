body: "Hello to All,\r\n\r\nI am new to the beauty and complexity of fonts in general
  and am in no way a professional in that area.  I do not make my money by writing
  or publishing. As I move along in my self education though, I have run across the
  history of Palatino.  I understand that the only digitized version of the original
  of Zapfs masterpiece is to be found on the font CD published by Softmaker.  I also
  found a thread on this site that discusses this, but it did not answer my questions.
  \ I hope you all can help.\r\n\r\n1. The original Palatino (rendered as Palazzo
  Original from Softmaker) is quite different from later digitized versions.  Although
  much crisper, the later versions seem less elegant and flowing to my eye.  The gotcha
  for me is that Palazzo Original was, I believe, digitized without the owners permission
  (who was the actual owner at this time anyway). Is this accurate?\r\n\r\n2. I have
  purchased Bitstreams collections via Corel and I am very happy with the font quality.
  For my uses I rarely require ligatures or small caps, so they are fine for me. If
  I purchase the CD from Softmaker and use Palazzo Original for my own use, is that
  a violation of copyright or other laws? What about ethically? It is a shame that
  such a beautiful font has not been digitized by more legitimate means.\r\n\r\n3.
  Since I used Bitsream fonts regularly and there are opinions about their fonts being
  \"rip-offs\", where does Softmaker stand?\r\n\r\n4. If a font published by a legitimate
  company is discontinued for some time, can a person or company redistribute the
  font after a set length time as in copyright law? \r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\nAll
  the Best,\r\nJohn"

  body: "The historical situation, as far I have ascertained it, is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe
    defunct H. Berthold AG, in 1992, one year before it went bankrupt in 1993, converted
    the old 1950 Palatino font, with the permission of Hermann Zapf, to a Postscript
    font, which is shown and embedded in the PDF scangraphic.pdf (see below) as \"Palatino
    BQ\" (see the PDF document properties).\r\n\r\nSeveral other font forging, font
    cloning and font renaming outfits, among them Scangraphic, Franzis, Softmaker,
    grapped this Postscript font file \"Berthold BQ\" after Berthold's bankruptcy
    and sold it under fancy names, e.g. under the names \"Paxim\" (Scangraphic), \"Palazzo\"
    (Softmaker), \"Palmer\" (Franzis), etc.\r\n\r\nSee for example\r\n\r\nwww.sanskritweb.net/forgers/scangraphic.pdf,
    page 13\r\n\r\nwww.sanskritweb.net/forgers/megafont.pdf, page 9\r\n\r\nwww.sanskritweb.net/forgers/franzis.pdf,
    page 23\r\n\r\nwww.sanskritweb.net/forgers/franzis2.pdf, page 42\r\n\r\nYou may
    use any of these versions, and also the old Berthold BQ version, for free, but
    you must not claim to be the copyright owner or the design owner, because the
    typopgraphical design rights to this 1950 Palatino have fallen into public domain.\r\n"

    from a mid-1960 book shows 1950 Palatino, which had been typeset in 8 on 10 points
    and had been printed by letterpress on wove paper. There was virtually no contrast
    between thin upstrokes and thick downstrokes (e.g. of capital A etc.) in small

    with the font Palatino in text using FontForge. Even in text sizes, it reads very
    well for a display face. It is a hair light, but that is what Aldus was developed
    to address. This is very good forum with many hands and minds willing to help
    a neophyte.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the question of ethics and legality is a little
    muddy (at least for me) with various opinions.  To be on the safe side, I will
    only use the font for my personal use and convert characters to graphics when
    I embed, which I rarely do.\r\n\r\nUli,\r\nThanks for the links and documents;
    they were extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nMichael,\r\nThanks for the education and enlightenment.\r\n\r\nAll

    books, etc use or have used the original Palatino? How about the original Aldus?\r\n\r\nThanks
