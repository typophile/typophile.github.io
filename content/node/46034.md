body: "I was thinking about the practical issues involved in using Calt/Liga for text
  faces today, and I started wondering about how much larger a file might be if it
  has has 10, 50, 100, 1000 or 10,000 feature entries. And what the real practical
  limitations might be in terms of the file size, for the Operating System (OSX, Windows
  Vista, XP etc.) , and applications, any one of which might potentially choke on
  an overly big file. Maybe file size per se isn't the only technical issue. I am
  BTW deliberately leaving out any mention of managing large #s of features which
  is essentially a different issue.\r\n\r\nIt's a broad question, and I know the answers
  are probably very specific and potentially very case dependent.\r\n\r\nStill, what
  is your take on this? Have you run into problems regarding this kind of thing as
  an OS, application, or font developer you would like to share?"

    right). This can be worked around with the \"extension\" function and appropriate
    subtable breaks, although not all possible clients will recognize that. Usually
    this comes up with kerning for really big fonts (e.g. Arno Pro).\r\n\r\nThere
    are a couple of size limits related to glyphs rather than features, as well:\r\n\r\n1)

  body: "I'm playing with interleaved contextual and stylistic set stuff for display
    type that goes way beyond anything that I would anticipate in a text face, and
    I have not hit any size limits in terms of software support -- at least not in
    my test environments, which in this case are InDesign and WPF --, although I have
    hit (anticipated) feature implementation issues. Sergey Malkin at MS confirms
    that my VOLT source for this project is the largest and most complex he has seen
    (a record I previously held with SBL Hebrew), and the GSUB table takes up something
    like 40% of the compiled font. This is the stuff I'll be showing at TypeCon this
    year.\r\n\r\nI can't imagine anything on that magnitude being necessary in a text
    face, even presuming that some characters have multiple forms for improved fit.
    Also, from my perspective there is an important net gain in not using ligature
    glyphs any more, since it massively simplifies the GPOS mark positioning work."

  body: "I must confess that large size of GSUB table in presence of complex lookups
    is the result of VOLT compiler not doing enough optimization work. As I understand,
    AFDK is doing better job. But contextual lookups usually do not have functional
    problems (resulting table may be too big for my taste, but will still work), positioning
    is much more problematic.\r\n\r\nBut this does not make John's work less complex
    and less amazing. Besides quality, his fonts are always my best VOLT testbed :).\r\n\r\nSergey"

  body: "Speaking of optimization, Read Roberts explained to me that there's not much
    a font developer can do to reduce the font file size. If the designer really thinks
    that the typeface is better served by having 30 OpenType features implemented
    in the font, or 20 contextual lookups, then there's no way you can compress that
    data to become half its size. Surely, sometimes lookups can be shared between
    features (e.g. you can define a lookup to be used by 'subs', and then reference
    that same lookup in 'sinf'), but for the most part each feature has its own unique
    lookup.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, from a text engine point of view, contextual
    lookups will definitely make a bigger dent on the processing performance than
    one-to-one lookups do, obviously. So, if you need to use contextual lookups try
    to keep their number low and each context as short as possible. (Contextual lookups
    are like [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions|regular expressions]],
    the more complex they are, the longer they take to process. No way to avoid that.)\r\n\r\nOf
    course there are some good practices a font developer should observe, which will
    help keep the font file size low. A simple one is to arrange the glyphs in the
    font into groups. So for example, putting the a\u2013z glyphs into a continuos
    range, and then ordering their corresponding small cap glyphs (a.sc\u2013z.sc)
    in the same way, will keep the size of the lookup generated by this substitution
    rule,\r\n\r\n<code>sub [a b c ... y z] by [a.sc b.sc c.sc ... y.sc z.sc];</code>\r\n\r\nat
    its minimum. This is because the GID ranges will be continuos and the offset from
    the original glyph to the resulting glyph is constant. I should stress that the
    secret to make this work relies on the way the glyphs are ordered throughout the
    font, not the way the features are written. This means that, if the glyphs are
    neatly ordered in the font, it doesn't matter if you use the code above, or any
    of the substitutions below.\r\n\r\n<code>sub [z y ... c b a] by [z.sc y.sc ...
    c.sc b.sc a.sc];\r\nsub [c y a ... z b] by [c.sc y.sc a.sc ... z.sc b.sc];</code>\r\n\r\nActually,
    recently I did an experiment in this area with one of our biggest Western fonts,
    Arno Pro. I took the original GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file, randomized the order
    of its lines (with the exception of the first line which must correspond to the
    .notdef glyph), and rebuilt one of the Italic fonts. Keep in mind I didn't change
    anything else; the OT code used, the PFA source font and all the supporting files
    were exactly the same. The results were interesting: 9% increase of the file size
    (460Kb to 504Kb). I guess the takeaway is, it pays-off to spend some time rationalizing
    the glyph order."
