  sure about hinting issue. \r\nIs it suffice to set stems  and make some corrections
  \ only in two masters ? or should I hint all instances individually?\r\nOf course
  i'm talking about basic Type1 hinting."

  body: "majus, thanks, but I haven't found the answer to my problem.\r\n\r\nThomas,
    yes I'm using Fontlab Studio.\r\n\r\nI've read about links, I think this is what
    I'm looking for. \r\nBut how does it work? When should I convert hints to links?
    \r\nDo these links save hints for all instances?"

  body: "Links are an internal FLS thing, which get turned into hints when you generate
    actual fonts.\r\n\r\nReally, for most people and purposes, you can just:\r\n-
    set your blue zones and key heights in each master, separately\r\n- make sure
    part of your production process is to autohint the generated instance-fonts\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I like to leave overlap in the masters where it is helpful, generate instances,
    auto-hint the instance, then remove overlap.\r\n\r\nAs long as your hinting parameters
    work with the font weight and all, that usually produces quite decent PostScript
    hinting.\r\n\r\n(Note that if you autohint a glyph in the MM, FLS does the hints
    for each master, and makes them compatible.)"
