    Casual Bold Italic]]. Several other brush-drawn fonts are also similar, but I
    have not yet found the exact match.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: thanks, I appreciate it, but I find the sample a little more rigorous in terms
    of precision and drawing, it's intriguing because it's still very systematic and
    somewhat geometric.

    That sort of lettering is also similar to this style, I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "A couple of the fonts in House's [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit/viewfonts|Sign
    Painter Font kit]] are pretty close, but still not an exact match. Is there a
    reason that it needs to be EXACTLY this font? Some suggestions that have been
    made would be so close that without side-by-side comparison 95 people out of 100
    would not know they were different. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: In <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/6954">this (even) older thread</a>,
    Mike F. suggested this might be a slanted Gee Whiz. It appears to be the same
    typeface as the one used for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/5420833925/in/photostream/">Giromania</a>.
