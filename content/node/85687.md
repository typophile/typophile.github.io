body: "I'm using Ostrich Sans and Ostrich Sans Black ( [[http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/18-ostrich-sans]]
  ) for headlines / titles and I'm looking for a body text font that would be a nice
  complement. Any ideas? I'm having a hard time finding a serif font that seems to
  go well with it and I'm almost tempted to use another sans-serif font, but i know
  that's generally not advisable. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    like Karmina or Maiola might work?
