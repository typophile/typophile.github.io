<p>I think so. I used to work as an editorial assistant for a number of magazines, and now that I am doing graphic design, I am seeing the importance of marrying my knowledge of these two &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; trades.</p>
<p>I am not a grammar pro, and I know I have lots to learn in regards to type; still I think that applying these knowledge bases in tandem makes one a better type user.</p>
<p>What do you think??</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A good typographer should be able to spell, should be able to parse out a sentence, should know principles of punctuation and syntax. A good typographer needs to know how language works, not just what it looks like. If we know how words work, we can make them look better and allow people to read them with greater ease.</p>
<p>&amp; a good typographer also needs to know how far to push the points about grammar he or she wishes to make to editors or copywriters. Be straightforward and steadfast when suggesting changes. Have evidence to back you up. &amp; know when to fold &lsquo;em. Nasty turf wars can ensue otherwise. We do not need that; our jobs are tough enough. If you know you have made a good case for good grammar you shall sleep the sleep of the blessed. Even if they reject your ideas and mutter behind your back.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I echo what Will says. I think it is useful to be well acquainted with standards and techniques of good writing, as well as good typesetting.</p>
<p>Know your boundaries, however, and tread carefully into the editorial realm. Be sure of your footing. There is room to gain respect from editors, and that provides the currency for constructive conversations. But it has to be earned. You have to decide (or learn) if you have what it takes to play that game.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s an absolute requirement for a good typographer.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a helpful typographer will serve better as a proofreader (i.e. catching out-and-out mistakes and inconsistencies) rather than as a copyeditor (i.e., suggesting rewrites and changes). That said, I come from a family of writers and editors and sometimes engage my editorial colleagues at that level.</p>
<p>On the flip side of this coin, however, is learning to give respect to and accept feedback from editors who likewise choose to educate themselves on graphic and typographic issues. The shoe is sometimes on the other foot, remember.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Will, that&rsquo;s an excellent description.</p>
<p>Just today I checked on our intern&rsquo;s progress on a poetry book, and, while he&rsquo;s typographically well educated by now, I managed to point out a few errors &ndash; by the author. Pretty minor ones, though; things such as &ldquo;the quote before <em>&lsquo;Twas</em> should be a closing one&rdquo;. And &ldquo;there should be three dots in an ellipsis &ndash; not two or four&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Pretty basic stuff, which could and/or should be picked up by a text editor &ndash; if there is one! (There wasn&rsquo;t for this project.)</p>
<p><cite>&amp; don’t go around changing copy on your own. Always check.</cite></p>
<p>&ndash; which I told him when he pointed out an error he saw all of his own, a misshapen sentence with dangling nouns and all. It being a poetry book, I tol&rsquo;im, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t always win. Leave that one to the author.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a scientific book, I don&rsquo;t hesitate to correct all and any spelling and grammar errors I happen to notice. Those professors clearly had something else on their mind than proper spelling :-)
And for really rough cases, I draw a large red rectangle around the offending text, with a side note &ldquo;Typesetter&rsquo;s notice: please check&rdquo;. At that point, it&rsquo;s up to them to ignore.</p>
<p>Where can we download the [[http://www.design-police.org|Design Police stickers]] as proper PDF stamps? At least the &ldquo;Hire a copywriter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Run the spellcheck&rdquo; ones!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think Will put it well.</p>
<p>I suppose that in posting this I was referring to times when the type is linked to the grammar; ellipsis (3 periods with a space in between each one), an em dash (no spaces on each side like an en dash), rules of case, and so on.</p>
<p>I think this is comparable to the benefit a graphic designer has when he/she knows something about photography. I am not a photographer <a href="http://evanmade.com/visualart.asp" target="_blank" title="some of my photography">(sometimes I wish)</a>, but I know a little about it, and it helps.</p>
<p>Will summed it up with, &ldquo;A good typographer needs to know how language works, not just what it looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good thoughts overall.</p>
