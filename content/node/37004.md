  in Boston area collections, the kind that Gerrit Noordzij recommends. I am of course
  looking for contextual alterations ligatures & so on. Has anybody on Typophile preceded
  me in looking at this stuff?\r\n\r\nI am also going to be looking at some Gutenburg
  pages for related reasons. What ligatures should I be on the look out for?\r\n\r\nCheers! "
