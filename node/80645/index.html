  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Help: I vaguely remember a presentation (at ATypI Dublin? Or maybe TYPO last year?) where somebody showed some glyphs (I seem to remember an &ldquo;O&rdquo; or &ldquo;o&rdquo;) where once the outer and once the inner contour was «ugly»/uneven, and discussed the effects; which, IIRC, were essentially that faults in the inner contour were noticeably more prominent and jarring than in the outer one. Now I can&rsquo;t for the life of me remember who/where this was, but I hope I haven&rsquo;t only dreamed it because the effect was really interesting, and I&rsquo;d like to find out more.
Does anyone know what and/or whom I&rsquo;m talking about, and can point me in a direction to find out more? Many thanks.</div>

<p>I did the same thing once to the inner, once the outer contour (FL: Action &gt; Add Nodes and then Action &gt; Random), and left the other contour clean. 
The ones on the left do look noticeably more «broken» to me.

Since counters tend to be closer to the center than the outsides, you notice the defects more.</p>
<p>But this only applies to individual large shapes (deliberative, non-immersive reading); in the case of boumas (which kick in during immersive reading) it must be more complicated.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a [quick] version where the distortions on the outer contour are proportionally equal to those in the inner one (the outer contour of the right hand glyph is a scaled-up version of the inner contour of the left hand one).
I agree the effect is less pronounced, but isn&rsquo;t it still visible? (Although now another effect kicks in too, because in the right hand one the thickness of the stroke varies more. Uh oh, I see this getting complex.)</p>

Funny, when I let the eyes defocus the opposite is true, probably because the stroke width changes more as you mentioned before.</p>
<p>Something I read somewhere argued that rather than the counter being background to the black shape, it is more perceived as a second layer of foreground, above the black shape. Perhaps this would account for the more profound effect as disruption of the fore-foreground. I wonder how one could prove or disprove this.</p>

<p>@James (Dunwich Type): What I meant was, I suspect this effect might not be as obvious/relevant/applicable in text (1) because of scale: at text sizes, the distance and hence the difference between acuity/sharpness with which we perceive inner and outer contours won&rsquo;t be as big as when staring at these huge glyphs; and (2) because of context: depending on where we fixate in the context of other letters, the (sharpest) focus does not need to lie in the center of say an &ldquo;o&rdquo;, as it sort-of automatically does here.

In all sizes, and not just popular but preferable&hellip; it seems to draw the eye when there are irregularities. That is what they went to. When I did Katytude for Letraset I remember having over 200 points on the exterior of the O and just 4 on the inside. I can send you a PDF of Peanut if you wish to look a bit closer.</p>
<p>I remember doing an italic demo years ago and I messed up the l/c o so I redid it. The class was taken aback as the exteriors were essentially the same but the interior had a hiccup in it. They simply said the hiccup caused visual distress.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It might be a function of our primal being back when we were intensely interested in seeing both food and predator in our horizon.  I theorize that the outer boundary is akin to the forest mantle and acts to frame what is inside our point of view.  We would not be alarmed to see foliage surrounding our viewpoint, but if a predator or an enemy were to become framed by that vegetative outer area, we would have reason to be quite alarmed and surely more attentive to that potential danger. Although not impossible, it is certainly less likely that a predator or foe could position himself as part of the framing foliage than to intrude on the space that it surrounds. This also may partly be why humans attend more to figure than to ground in things they see. I think we just focus quickly on what we are conditioned to think is crucial to life and sustenance, even if we just ignore all other visual stimuli.</div>

<p>I am not sure that I understand the difference between weathered and distressed. I think they are terms that have been invented to describe what I call edge texture&hellip; interior or exterior. Other terms in lettering include notching, cutting, roughing etc.</p>
<p>Distressed has always been to me, taking Helvetica Bold and putting lines through it to make it look old like a rusted sign :-)</p>

<p>Hey science has to explain what we experience. Our experience controls, not the other way around.</p>
<p>I think this has to do with the &ldquo;salience&rdquo; of counters in reading: that the brain really relies on these in identifying letters, as Peter Enneson has argued.</p>
