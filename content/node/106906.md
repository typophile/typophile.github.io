body: "I started by writing the name with a paint pen, scanning it in, and turning
  it into a vector. My goal is to create something that is upbeat, fresh, and doesn't
  look homemade. Feel free to critique it in a reverse compliment sandwich. \r\n\r\nHere
  is a link to the band for comparison. http://mableyandgreek.bandcamp.com/#zplays\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJamie"
