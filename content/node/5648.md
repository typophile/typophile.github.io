  body: Fun project. Driving fast is my guilty pleasure. <BR> <BR>The way you have
    joined &#40;visually&#41; the RA pair, I think you can do the same with the GI
    pair in GIRL. Lop the exit serif off of the G. I wonder if something similar couldn&#39;t
    be done with the CE pair?

  body: WHATEVER Paul! I was recently in California, driving north from San Francisco
    to Eureka and I have not been around worse drivers. They sit in the inside lane
    and basically expect you to pass them on the right. I no longer think Utah drivers
    are the worse.

    we&#39;re in UT. I miss Eureka - did you stop at the Samoa Cookhouse while you
    were up there?

  body: s&#39;ok paul. i&#39;ve known for quite a while that bad driver&#39;s are
    what most people become when they are put behind the wheel of an autmobile. nope,
    didn&#39;t make it to the cookhouse. we were mostly in Petrolia on the coast.

  body: 'This seems to be an emerging topic all of a sudden. LA Weekly did a feature
    story about racer chicks recently, and Speedvision is plastered with this stuff
    now. Anyway. <BR> <BR>Calliope, I don&#39;t think this is racy enough. You need
    more chaos... or dare I say, fury. <BR> <BR>And here&#39;s an idea to promote
    the &#34;genderness&#34;: turn the top-left serif of the big &#34;R&#34; into
    a pony tail, maybe one that turns into flames at the tip&#40;s&#41;. Too cheesy?
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>And Tiffany, what&#39;s &#34;fast&#34;? <BR> <BR>&#62; They
    sit in the inside lane and basically <BR>&#62; expect you to pass them on the
    right. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s when you pass them on the left anyway. <BR>It&#39;s
    easier at night though: get yourself some 100W Hellas with the left one pointed
    to the left mirror and the other to the rear view, move slghtly to the left, then
    roast corneas as needed. You&#39;d be surprised at the quick and easy results.
    Except for the ones who raise <i>both</i> hands to cover their eyes - those you
    should just go around quickly. After all the only safe car is the one behind you.

    version: be  <BR>careful of gaps that are so tiny they should be either widened
    or  <BR>closed altogether. For example: G-I in Girl, R-A, R-S in Racers.  <BR>I&#39;d
    drop the beard on the &#39;G&#39;, it seems superfluous compared to  <BR>the other
    glyphs.'

  body: 'Hrant suggested aiming for a pun! I agree. Considering the topic: the unusual
    mix of women and racing cars ... and considering this is a school project &#40;where
    you should try be as radical in your solutions as you can&#41; ... I don&#39;t
    think you should be satisfied with &#39;just&#39; a namemark with type that merely
    hints racing. <BR> <BR>Go for the visual pun. Well, it could be a pony-tail &#40;in
    itself a very good choise, connotating swiftness, youth, &#39;rebellion&#39;&#41;
    replacing a part of the typography ... or something similar. <BR> <BR>I can see
    a solution here with a very humorous pun ... something like Luballin or Pentagram

  body: 'Oh! No, I&#39;m still a student and in school, but the job and application
    of the logo is real. The women in the documentary all drive in different types
    of races too, some are drag racers, but some drive in the Le Mans series and Formula
    car races which are pretty sophisticated, upscale markets. '

  body: Nonon. No ponytails. The fact that this typeface has curves and edges in all
    the right places is plenty feminine. If anything I suppose the Cap R in Racers
    could flip down or curve under but only if it followed form of the rest of the
    typeface. If it is subtle enough you could do it in all three Rs ... but if it
    starts to look like decoration I wouldn&#39;t do it. Perhaps you could use a fiery
    hot pink with nice bold black outlines and shadows or something, no pony tails
    .... unless it looks like a swash first and a ponytail last. <BR> <BR>I agree
    with Stephen&#39;s comment about spaces/gaps. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>hrant ... i
    hit 115 the other day &#40;not that fast I guess, compared to official race car
    driving&#41;. some punk thought he could out race me. i think he was flirting,
    but my mind was elsewhere so i was little mean &#40;i suppose&#41;. felt good
    and then i realized how stupid it might have been. i think i need to find a local
    race track.

  body: 'Tiffany -- whether I should be swash first and ponytail last or the other
    way round, I&#39;m sure the pun solution could be done successfully. <BR> <BR>And
    of course it can be done &#39;your&#39; way, with the typography merely hinting
    the feminine. Only, I think these hints are so subtle that you could say: the
    typography says racing but it doesn&#39;t say girls ... on the other hand, it
    doesn&#39;t say anything irrelevant. <BR> <BR>Whether or not it should be the
    pun or the subtle solution, would depend on the media and the target audience.
