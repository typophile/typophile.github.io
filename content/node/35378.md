  needs a new logo.  I stumbled across this site and think it's awesome.  I'm asking
  for assistance with this project--any suggestions would be appreciated.  \r\n\r\nCurrent
  name of facility: Town & Country Racquet Club.  The racquet club part no longer
  is their forte; however they do have tennis and racquetball courts.  They are a
  family fitness center and they want to be the wellness resource for the community.
  \ The community is approximately 16,000 people and other than a rec center and women's
  health facility, this club is the biggest.  Town & Country does not really define
  them except they have had those words in their name since 1974.  The owner isn't
  sure whether to go with Family Fitness & Wellness Center, Athletic Club or just
  Wellness Center.  I would like to take some different options to her.  The current
  logo has tennis racquets incorporated; however, she is not tied to that piece of
  her logo at all.  I would think any design in the logo needs to tie into a wellness
  theme--the balance of body, mind and spirit.  This logo would be for print and could
  be more than one color.\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks in advance for any input.  "

    the fitness center REALLY family oriented, or are they just saying that? upscale
    or down-to-earth? the community is 16,000, but how many CURRENT members at the
    club? "
