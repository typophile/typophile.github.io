body: So-- <BR>Curious if anyone here hs any higher end experience with color seperations,
  specifically different levels of GCR, and what may be more appropriate for an image
  I am working with?? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: In my experience, this has a lot to do with the specific printing process
    you&#39;re using, as well as the particular image in question. For example, running
    a web press on newsprint you want to crank the GCR to the max. You can&#39;t get
    good shadow density anyway on newsprint. Sheetfed offset on glossy coated paper,
    you want pretty light GCR. But the particular image is also relevant. <BR> <BR>The
    UCA will help keep the shadows dense while the GCR cleans up the midtones and
    allows for brighter colors. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'The usual advice is &#39;speak to your printer&#39;, but unfortunately printers
    rarely make their own separations these days &#40;they&#39;re too used to receiving
    images as CMYK drum-scans from their regular repro house&#41; and won&#39;t be
    able to tell you much. <BR> <BR>GCR/UCR generally shouldn&#39;t differ from image
    to image, but from process to process, as Thomas says. I&#39;m guessing you know
    the difference between GCR and UCR, but just in case: UCR = under colour removal;
    GCR = grey component replacement. In practice, UCR isn&#39;t much different to
    a Light GCR: it basically removes C, M and Y from deep shadows, rather than gradually
    replacing all neutral tones with black, as would a Medium or Heavy GCR. <BR> <BR>Both
    GCR and UCR interact with the TAC, or Total Area Coverage, which is the maximum
    amount of ink allowed by the seaparation process in any one area of the image.
    Higher TAC means deeper shadows with more CMY in them; lower TAC means more neutral
    mixes of CMY are replaced with black. <BR> <BR>For offset, on coated paper, typical
    settings would be 300-320 TAC, Light or Medium GCR or UCR. For Newsprint, TAC
    250, Medium or Heavy GCR. This is obviously because a good offset press with good
    coated stock can stand a lot of ink and you&#39;ll maximise the dynamic range
    of your image by taking advantage of that; newsprint turns to mush when you apply
    a lot of ink so you need to compromise dynamic range to accomodate that. <BR>
    <BR>There are subtler shadings -- I&#39;ll sometimes use a lower TAC &#40;say
    280&#41; and/or a heavier GCR for lighter-weight coated stock, to avoid show-through
    in books &#40;not an issue in one-sided posters etc.&#41;. <BR> <BR>Different
    weights of GCR have their advantages and disadvantages, when you&#39;re in a position
    to choose between them. For example, say you&#39;re printing a book, offset, on
    good quality coated stock. Generally you would use a Light GCR or UCR. This gives
    the pressman a lot of control over the colours that will manifest on press, because
    neutrals are made predominantly from CMY, not K. Therefore he can warm up your
    images by pulling Cyan out or cool them down by pulling M/Y. He can lighten or
    darken them overall by manipulating overall CMY densities, and all this without
    affecting text which may be printed on the same sheet as the images, because he&#39;s
    not touching the black plate at all &#40;presuming the text is printed solid black&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Conversely, with a Medium or heavier GCR, the pressman has little control
    over the colour of the neutrals, which are predominantly composed of K. He will
    have difficulty lightening or darkening images without affecting the text or making
    the images appear banded or washed out. So why might you want to use a Medium
    or heavier GCR in a case like this? Because you can&#39;t go to the press pass
    and you don&#39;t trust the pressman not to mess up your neutrals. If overall
    image density is less important than neutral neutrals, Medium or heavier GCR is
    the way to go, but bear in mind that if the black plate is running heavy on press
    that day, your images will be mud. Risky. <BR> <BR>The last issue, as Thomas hints,
    is that a very few images will benefit from heavier GCR in general: four-colour
    greyscales are one example; computer screenshots are another. In these, you want
    blacks and neutrals to be pretty much black, with CMY used only to deepen shadows.
    <BR> <BR>UCA is another question. I don&#39;t normally risk it as it really shouldn&#39;t
    be necessary and can plug up your shadows if you&#39;re not very careful. Certainly
    no higher than 10% anyway. <BR> <BR>Hope that helps, <BR> <BR>R'
