body: Im using a mac in an office thats all PCs. Everything was working fine until
  they upgraded their network and now im having problems. <BR>I can connect to the
  network &#40;ethernet&#41; and can recieve mail but cannot log on to any websites
  &#40;im not blocked from using the internet&#41;. Explorer works a bit and very
  slowly &#40;we have broadband&#41; but firefox and safari dont work at all. The
  strange thing is when I go to network preferences and set airport configuration
  to off, firefox works but explorer stops.  <BR>Has anyone any idea what the problem
  is and why does it seem airport has anything to do with it.
