<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>The new owners of a 15th century English country pub and restaurant have asked me to rebrand it in a way that reflects both its obvious traditional qualities and the fresh contemporary atmosphere they hope to foster.
I've taken the brief quite literally with a kind of humanist? neo gothic script hybrid type treatment.
I'm not sure if i have succeeded, so your criticims would be greatly appreciated.
Give me your worst you crazy typoholics.

The layout is just a concept mockup using crapy photos from an old website.
I hope you can forgive the drop shadow on the big P :)

<div class=commentbody>I really like it too. Only thing, you might consider repositioning/resizing the words "At Stalisfield Green", it doesn't feel quite right to me yet. But "The Plough" is beautiful - very distinct and appropriate.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the second take best from a "it's more trendy" perspective (yech! did I actually say that?)
Sounds like the sort of place I'd put on our list of "pubs to visit the next time we're over" list.
(Of course, that's assuming they've got real beer and non-"fashion-victim" food: give me well-crafted pub grub anyday!)

<div class=commentbody>I might try loosening up the text in the second take, Clarendon can kinda run into itself on occasion, especially the "At Stalisfield Green" section.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm sorry but the lettering really doesn't work for me, it has some of the claw-like qualities you might find in a horror film combined with wrought iron.

http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=wexford
These two typefaces have some of the traditional/contemporary qualities that you are looking for and are very English in appearance, they might spark an alternative direction.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the comments and suggestions everyone.
Over 130 reads but only 7 comments? I hope that means it's genereally OK. I guess more people would respond if there was something drastically or obviously wrong with it. Or maybe i'm just not very popular round here :)
If the client gives positive feedback i will refine it further and try to improve the compositon regarding the "At Stalisfield Green" line. I will probably modify some of the terminals? and serifs to reduce that "Harry Potter" vibe too.
Linda - The 2 images aren't so much alternates, but more to show the client how either the traditional or trendy (blurgh!) qualities of the logo/pub could be accentuated when required. You can put the pub on your list as I have been assured both the beer and the food is real thing :)
Tim - I'm sort of glad you picked up on the claw-like and wrought iron qualities because i wanted the logotype to work as a bit of a visual metaphor for an actual old iron plough. But i can see what you're saying. It was a concern of mine too. Unfortunately any gothic script/blackletter styling risks evoking horror film connotations. I'd hoped to go back to it's roots and not the 70's Hammer films. It's a very fine line, which i may have crossed :(
Tim - Thanks for your suggested alternatives, but i think Wexford Oakley has overtones even more worrying than horror films and is just plain ugly. If the client has the same concerns as you about what i've done then i may consider the Sparrowhawk route. With some modification it could work well. Ta for that one.

<div class=commentbody>Funny, other people have said it's ugly, I don't see it that way, rather as an attractive modernisation of Old English, I'll just have to accept that it's like Marmite (either that or my taste is completely wrong) :)
Maybe you could try just developing the plough motif from one character, P or g perhaps. Either way I think you need to look at the stresses in the rounded characters, they seem too symmetrical at the moment.

<div class=commentbody><em> "I think you need to look at the stresses in the rounded characters, they seem too symmetrical at the moment." </em>
Tim - I agree, the stresses aren't quite right on all the rounded characters, but i'm confused (and more than a little ignorant about such things) when you say they seem too symmetrical. I thought stresses were symmetrical within a character but can vary in angle through a font. Or is that too simplistic?
I admit i took the easy option of using the 'o' with bits added or removed to build the other rounded letters. It was intentional though, in the hope of limiting the gothic vibe a little.
I'm happy with vertical stress on the o, but certainly the u and h and maybe the g and e could be improved.

<div class=commentbody>I meant that the top left and bottom right strokes of the o should be thinner than those of the top right and bottom left, mimicking the stroke of an italic pen, but having read your last perhaps that is part of the intended avoidance of gothic.

<div class=commentbody>I think it's well done, but doesn't really look "pubish." It looks too goth to me, and the descenders too much like fangs. I think a pub is a warm inviting place, this looks a bit scary.</div>
