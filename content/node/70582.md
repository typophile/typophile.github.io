body: "Have managed to persuade a client to reduce their corporate typeface from the
  awkward Fago range down to just using FagoExBold as a headline, and pairing this
  with Akkurat. \r\n\r\nThis works well to contrast the Character of the Fago headline
  font with a precise sans. Problem is Akkurat is too condensed for the aging design
  director as body copy, and does not read as comfortably as a text font. I have tried
  a -25 kerning and this seems to help. \r\n\r\nBut he is adamant the new Founders
  Grotesk is a better pairing for Fago! To me they seem to both have too much character
  to be seen together, and the clean nature of the Akkurat is a great contrast.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts on how to make Akkurat work as body copy better? Or on the pairing choice?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  Why is Fago such an unkerned beast. It seems like we have to go through set copy
  more often thatn most fonts just to get it looking half decent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Pairing FF Fago and Akkurat, and using the first for display and the latter
    for text, doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. If anything, you should do it the
    other way around. Fago is a humanist with open counters spaced and designed for
    text while Akkuratshines at large sizes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the usual approach to
    pairing is finding fonts that contrasts. Your two choices look so similar that
    the pair might end up looking more like a mistake than a delibirate decision."
