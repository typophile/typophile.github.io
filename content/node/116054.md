body: "I need to select fonts to give a new business a specific vintage look and feel.
  Of course, we hope to create - as much as possible - a unified presentation for
  a variety of venues including letterhead, e-mail, e-commerce website (viewable on
  desktop, tablet and smartphone), print catalog, and collateral materials.\r\n\r\nIn
  addition to a unified look, the other interest was in selecting fonts to create
  a memorable impression for the business. We would like the lettering to stand out
  enough that people might notice it is something a little different \u2013and yet
  be able to read it with ease.\r\n\r\nThe present product logo uses Benguiat which,
  while a \u201Cyoung\u201D font, was used to convey a product with qualities circa
  1900 \u2013a little art nouveau and a little arts & crafts. A company logo is still
  to be designed, but the present thinking was to use Benguiat again to convey the
  relationship between product brand and maker. The website design target is essentially
  vintage modern \u2013basically how a turn of the century business might have designed
  a website (had the internet existed at the time). \r\n\r\nMy understanding had been
  that \u201Cserif is for print and sans serif is for electronic media.\u201D If so,
  then having a single vintage serif font for text use in print and electronic media
  would not work. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if the use of serif fonts is still viewed
  as restricted to print. If not, then I would appreciate hearing any suggestions
  for an appropriate serif font for us to use \u201Ceverywhere.\u201D If a separate
  sans serif font is needed for electronic media, I would also appreciate hearing
  any suggestions for it along with a \u201Cserif partner\u201D for print. (BTW -
  I do not think a single sans serif will work aesthetically for both print and web.)\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your input! (And sorry for the length of this, but it seemed best to provide
  the particulars.)\r\n"
