  I thought I knew this one. Can someone identify it? It might be time to get them

  body: I'm guessing the 'e' is a tortured version of whatever typeface this is, as
    well as, perhaps, the G (although it doesn't look tortured).

  body: Like the on-off button on my computer, for example.  :-)  And I bet they paid
    a lot of money for it -- kind of makes one wonder, doesn't it?

  body: The on/off symbol is way overused. I think I've seen it on at least a dozen
    logos. Time to put it to rest

  body: Yeah, that Goodwrench logo is reminiscent of the Quicktime mark.  Actually,
    I like the simplicity of the on/off button creating the G.
