    In a first reading I think that the  result of Z its not good. You can improve

    for you opinion!\r\n\r\nConcordo plenamente com o que disseste relativamente ao
    U e ao Z. Vou tentar corrigir essas letras e j\xE1 as ponho aqui!\r\nTranslation:
    I agree with the comments about the U and the Z. I'll redraw them and post it
    here for feedback!"

  body: "The attempt looks very good to me so far. I see it as a fresh approach to
    fraktur. Of course, capitals will be needed, and \xE4\xF6\xFC\xDF, and long s,
    to say nothing of ligatures [long s + t], ch, ck etc., and - since we're chatting
    in Portuguese - que tal incluir tamb\xE9m \xE1\xE8\xEE\xF5\xFC\xE7 e fam\xEDlia?!\r\n\r\nRonald

    kyrmse! Now I'm really into developing this font. And yeah, I'm thinking on doing
    all that stuff. Still don't know how the capitals are going to be but i have some
    ideas for the ligatures! I'll post it soon.\r\n\r\nPs: It's nice to see so many
    people talking Portuguese around here!"

    Z. I'll give your version a try to see how it fits along with the other letters.
    I'll post it along with the double s when i finish it! Once again thanks for the
    help!"

  body: This reminds me a bit of my unfinished [[http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/geogothic|geogothic
    font on fontstruct]]. Since this is so modular, it looks a lot like a fontstruct
    font (or is that in fact how it was made?). Given that resemblance, you might
    look at blackletter fonts on that site to give you ideas on how to solve some
    of the trickier letters.

    also tried to do a double s (just learned about it) but i think I've done it wrong!\r\nDoes
    the S looking part need to be on the baseline? And should the f looking part be
    an ascendant?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/black4_6227.png]"

    the other characters!\r\n\r\nThanks for you suggestion I'll take a look."

  body: "I like your work so far, however, sometimes you're using too many elements
    in order to achieve the shape. About the Z, IMHO the best Z is the first one and
    then the second one. This last Z doesn't resemble the overall look of the glyphs.
    I did this Z just for fun, using the idea of the 'x' glyph in your alphabet, you
    kept it clean, upside and down. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/z_4572.gif]\r\n\r\nIt's
    just and idea, nothing else, but my point is that in the same way you worked with
    x, y, r, you should clean a bit some other glyphs. However, it's a great kickstart.
    Take a look at the free font [[http://www.suitcasetype.com/index.php?lmut=en&part=fonts&font=24|Metalista]]
    to see how they solved some other glyphs.\r\nRegards."

  body: "Thanks ilovecolours!\r\n\r\nI agree with you wen you say I'm probably using
    too much elements... it\xB4s a very modular design, and probably I should start
    adding some details that improve the letter  legibility and simplify their shapes!\r\n\r\nIt's
    curious that you mention Metalista because that is the font that got me inspired!
    \r\nOn a first stage I tried to abstract myself from that font, In order to try
    and create my own solutions, but I'll take a second look at it now and try to
    clean some of the shapes!\r\n\r\nRegards."
