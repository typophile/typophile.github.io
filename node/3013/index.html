  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am designing a logo for a tech company and they like the design finally &#40;after many, many tries&#41;. They like the look of the Helvetica Ultra Compressed for the &#34;text&#34;, but I don&#39;t like the way it looks in the address line. Is there a font that looks like HUC, but has a much shorter x-height and is extended? I want to maintain the &#34;techie&#34; look. The client loves the o&#39;s and the basic rectangular look of the letters.  <BR> <BR>Anything that I could use to complete the look without them knowing I&#39;m using a different font? And, please keep in mind this is only the first round of the final design, so it&#39;s still kind of rough. The address line seems to overwhelm the rest of the card and I want the rocket and the person&#39;s name to be the primary visuals. I&#39;d prefer to fill up more of the white space on the bottom line and to give it a lighter more futurist feel.  <BR> <BR>One more thing, the t at the end of rocket is a visual irritation to me. I&#39;m considering dropping the top of the t to the bottom of the e and moving the logic to left or just replacing it with a lowercase t. Any input? <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25811.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Dawn, <BR> <BR>If you are going for a futurist look I would stay away from Helvetica altogether. Too much of a 70s feel. There are many more sans serif fonts that would lighten up this card.  <BR> <BR>I would also look at making the address line a little bigger. Use flush left or right alignment to pull the name, title and address together. <BR> <BR>The false small caps on &#34;President&#34; should be replaced with either all caps, or title case. <BR> <BR>The problem with the E and the T is the space between the letters. Try pulling the T across and joining ET to lose this space.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with all your suggestions, however, the client doesn&#39;t want to change the format. Believe me, I&#39;ve tried. This is about the 100th idea and my original format for this version was different and they changed it to the above and finally found something they &#34;loved&#34;. So the changes I make have to be subtle or we&#39;ll be back redesigning &#40;design by committee with a lot of A types&#41;.  <BR> <BR>But I&#39;m not totally thrilled with it and want to add a little more class. I don&#39;t think I can change the font for &#34;LOGIC&#34; or the name. I tried setting the title in all caps, all lower case, upper and lower, and small caps and they only liked the above version for the title. I will try your suggestion on the ET and hope they won&#39;t notice. I truly appreciate the your input, though.  <BR> <BR>What other fonts would you suggest? Most of the other ones I&#39;ve tried were too round for the client and they didn&#39;t like them. They really are hooked on the rectangular shape of the letters.</div>
