  body: Apart from the fact that it isn't bold enough and the little serif on the
    baseline stroke of the 2 is missing in Morgan Avec, it is <em>incredibly</em>
    close.

    [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=68|the newer version]] has
    the 2 like that. Several characters, e.g. the 2 or the G, seem to have been changed."

    or a custom weight by Mario for the event?
