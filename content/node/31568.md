  Edwardian Script to be very close to what I need/want for a base/study font.\r\n\r\nBasically
  I'm going to be editing the font into a custom wordmark and would like to have something
  very close to Edwardian Script to base it off of - however is there anything out
  there a little less common, and little less \"wedding\" looking.\r\n\r\nIdeally
  it would be a little bit more natural, and have some more character - I guess not
  as perfect.\r\n\r\nAn indie font would be great!\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!"
