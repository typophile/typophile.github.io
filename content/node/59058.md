  body: 'I hope they have another mock funeral like they did with OS 9. The coffin
    could be filled with .dfonts. It''s not that they were that terrible, but they
    did inconvenience customers by causing a lot of confusion. My understanding was
    that at some point Apple needed a data-fork only version of TrueType and it was
    easier to shoehorn the resource fork in and make a .dfont than to support the
    Windows-style .ttf format. They were a true evolutionary dead-end, because they
    offered nothing but incompatibility. '

  body: Inconsolata is a pretty awesome font. It is what I have been using in Textmate
    for my code work for a while. Definitely easier on the eyes and it feels lighter.
    I'm a fan!

  body: "According to <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/06/15/font-changes\">John
    Gruber</a>, there were some errors in the Ars Technica piece, including the part
    about Apple dropping Monaco. It will still be included, but Menlo will be the
    new default monospaced font in Apple's development apps.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of errors,
    I think the Ars Technica author meant \"venerable\" and not \"veritable\" near
    the end of the first paragraph."

  body: Actually, now that I look at it again, I see that the Ars Technica piece has
    been updated with the correct info about Monaco. It still says "veritable" in
    the first paragraph, though. :-)

  body: Those Ars-holes! They based a good bit of that article on what I wrote in
    the previous thread. Bit I did indeed use the adjective "venerable" which they
    terribly misquoted. I'm given to thinking they don't know what that means.

    the old fashioned way... using Bing.\r\n\r\nArs should have given TP more credit. "
