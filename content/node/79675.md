  might be part of a family... any gurus like to take a stab at IDing the typeface
  in this PDF?\r\n\r\nIt's a scan so I can't ID it from Acrobat, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.duttsonrocks.com/pdf/es_ad_july_07.pdf\r\n\r\nGot
  to do an ad for them for a brochure, but they can't help and their usual agency
  won't spill the beans.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help.\r\n\r\n"
