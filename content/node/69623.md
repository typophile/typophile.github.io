  issue \u2013 Elizabeth Spacilova, a translator whose main goal is to help make TYPO
  an enjoyable read for English speakers as well.\r\n\r\nNow in its eighth year of
  publication, TYPO aims to provide readers with a magazine that is systematically
  devoted to typography, graphic design and visual communication. The magazine\u2019s
  focus and content has earned it a firm place on the Czech and international markets:\r\n\r\n1.
  The magazine appeals to design professionals as well as beginning designers and
  people outside the business in a clear and comprehensible manner.\r\n\r\n2. Because
  it views typography and graphic design as an integral part of culture, it also monitors
  related disciplines (a broad range \u2013 from architecture and photography to philosophy
  and sociology).\r\n\r\n3. In blocks dedicated to individual subjects, it maps out
  important milestones in the history of international typography and design.\r\n\r\n4.
  Through original articles and interviews, it acquaints readers with important names
  and international leaders in the field.\r\n\r\n5. It does print articles with clear
  opinions; it does not print press releases or covert advertisements. Paid advertisements
  are restricted to a small area (usually on the inside cover of the magazine).\r\n\r\nOur
  demanding criteria, freedom of opinion and independence from advertisers makes us
  dependant on something else, though: you, the reader. Only regular readers, and
  especially subscribers, make it possible for the magazine to survive in a market
  economy. If you work in typography and graphic design and you enjoy and identify
  with the focus of our magazine, support us by becoming a subscriber. (TYPO has between
