  body: "I think Jason Walcott's version on Veer is a more extensive set, but the
    biggest difference is that one is the ITC design (fonts.com) by Ed Benguiat, with
    a true italic, and the other is based on the Phemister/Griffith version and has
    a swashed obliqued Roman for its italic.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I hesitated in my ID. I posted Veer, but then remembered Fonts.com. You are
    so good at this, Mike, it is scary. ;^)

  body: "Stay away from the wimpified ITC version. It has none of the charm and pizzaz
    of the original, now succesfully digitised and available from Jukebox Type and
    Veer.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents."

  body: Where is The Incredible String Band in that poster? Am I missing something?
    I used to be able to read Bookman, even when it was as badly set as this.

    me. :^P
