  body: I know that we said that FontShop Australia had the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com.au/fontdetailc.php3?ns=&amp;sns=&amp;co=&amp;co2=&amp;id=fp-2818"
    target="_blank">Alternates</a> &#40;from Scangraphic&#41; shown, but apparently
    they are not for sale if you are not from Australia or New Zealand. Can anyone
    confirm that? When I look at that page there is no pricing information, as there
    is for other fonts. Maybe it means it&#39;s not for sale at all, but then why
    show it?

  body: Thanks Ignacio, but I wasn&#39;t trying to get the fonts. I was actually trying
    to see if it was possible to buy them &#40;and the thread you pointed to shows
    that it is -- thanks&#41;, because I had someone ask me about them. I remembered
    the Australia FontShop, but hit what seemed like a dead end there. Buying it by
    phone will be my advice next time.
