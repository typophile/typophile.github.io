body: "I'm looking for a non-Clarendon (read the \"I saw Clarendon on 9 magazines
  post\") slab serif to use for display type. Something that is not too \"western\"
  \u2014I'm not looking to brand anything with it. Something that maybe has a historic
  edge to it\u2014nothing too modern (along the lines of Dispatch or Apex). It needs
  to be a square serif as it is being paired in the design with a traditional serif
  and I want there to be distinction between the two. Has to have an extra bold and/or
  heavy weight.\r\n\r\nthanks for any suggestions!"

    body: "I feel that they both have a very modern look to them\u2014I am looking
      to do a \"throwback\" style design and when I plug those 2 in (and caecilia
      for that matter) to me they end up giving a vibe of too new. Plus, as far as
      magazines go, I've seen Dispatch and Caecilia too much in use. Looking for something
      a little more obscure."

  body: 'Soho: brand new, more modern and square. Stainless, kind of wacky but also
    square. PMN Caecilia, classic. Amasis, similar to Caecilia but more contrast and
    bracketed serifs. Caecilia and Amasis seem more suited to combination with a traditional
    serif face.'

    is the sans companion to Dispatch.
