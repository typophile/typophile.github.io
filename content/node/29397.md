  great typeface but I am having trouble accessing the ornaments. \r\nI seem to be
  able to get the starting, ending swashes but not the ornaments? Can anyone who has
  this typeface help. \r\nI need it desperately! Thanks!"

  body: I'm not really familiar with BELLO, but how are you attempting to access the
    ornaments - and do you actually mean ornaments, or the various "words" built into
    the font? Going through the Glyph palette in InDesign you should have access to
    every individual glyph, but I'd guess that the auto-replacements are either discretionary
    ligatures or contextual alternates, both of which can be "turned on" in the Character
    palette.

    body: Hi Jason, I have opened the Glyph palette and what I am after are there,
      but how do I apply them to the end letter of a work, I am unsure. I have tried
      turning on all options in the open type palette but to no avail? Thanks for
      your reply.

  body: The BELLO PDF seems to have a bunch of keystroke options for placing some
    of the features, but I can't quite figure them out. <a href="http://www.underware.nl/download/bello/pdf/bello-practical.pdf"

  body: "Hold on, do you mean how do you add a glyph from the Glyph palette into your
    text? On the crazy chance that this is what you mean, just put your cursor in
    your text box and then double-click on the glyph you want in the Glyph palette.
    Shazam.\r\n\r\nIf that's not what you meant, sorry to state the obvious."
