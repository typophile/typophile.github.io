  body: I read a lot of fashion and architecture magazines. I really love seeing the
    colors and textures used in textiles of all kinds.  <BR> <BR>One utility that
    I quite like is <a href="http://www.code-line.com/software/colorconsultantpro.html"
    target="_blank">Color Consultant Pro</a> -- easily manipulated to create subtle
    combinations of all varieties. The fun part is finding pantone colors to match,
    and for me this is when the real color creativity begins.
