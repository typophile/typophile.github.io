body: "I am doing a re-design of our magazine. It is about art, design, new media/video,
  technology, and communication. We have been using the Univers family for everything
  and it's gotten stale. \r\n\r\nI need a tech feel that also has a friendliness to
  it. Right now I am looking at Klavika, Purista, and Aaux Pro as displays, but possibly
  body text as well. I also want to find a good serif typeface to pair it with. \r\n\r\nNot
  sure if I am way off track. Any thoughts?"

  body: Check out the  [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=camingo|Camingo]]
    family. Tech with a friendly feel IMO. Camingo was first, and I guess Camingo
    Dos is a new version with some changes.

    Camingo and alternatives.
