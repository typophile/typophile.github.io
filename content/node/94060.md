  \   Hi,\r\n    I\u2019m wondering if anyone can help me with something related to
  Dan.  I had the pleasure of knowing Dan for 30+ years as my mother married him in
  1982.  In the process of cleaning out his files/records (along with his 2 sons),
  we have come across a number of vintage materials that I\u2019m sure would have
  value to collectors or others interested in typography.  Can anyone recommend how
  we could go about determining what is valuable/of interest and what is not?  Please
  let me know via post, or the moderator has my email.  Thanks.\r\n    Dave\r\n\r\nI
  couldn't figure out how to contact the site's moderator to suggest Typophile or
  other sources to him.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    GHD hair straighteners, <a href=\"http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to
    britney\u2019s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty,
    broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd\u2019s usually are not all
    that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage
    to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a
    couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard
    to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals
    Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get
    those ghd\u2019s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults
