  condensed, not far to be ultra condensed)\r\n\u2013 script, like a handwriting\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\u2013
  sans-serif, so quite simple\r\n\u2013 if possible a free font :P\r\nany ideas?\r\n\r\nI
  had a good look on dafont, but couldn't find much what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nBig
  thanks in advance!"
