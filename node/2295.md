  releases in the Dark Sun product line.  I have found similar fonts, but none that
  match it precisely. <BR> <BR>I have chosen letters for the sample that are some
  of the most distinctive of the font as a whole.  If this still is not enough for
  a positive ID, I can provide a whole page of scanned text. <BR> <BR>Good luck...I
  don&#39;t think you can do it.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Wow! nice eye Randy. I knew I&#39;d seen this before. If I&#39;d gotten further
    <BR>into my Old Style font notebook, I&#39;d have reached my entry for Packard.
    <BR> <BR>Like many typefaces in the Solotype Catalog, Dieter Steffmann <BR>digitized
    this as <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm"
    target="_blank"> Packard Antique</a>. So if you are able to use Windows <BR>Truetype
    or Type 1, it&#39;s a freebie. Comes with a bold variant as well. <BR> <BR>No
    promise, of course, that Steffmann&#39;s version will match your <BR>sample precisely.

  body: 'I am impressed!  I have been looking for the font off-and-on for about 5
    years or more. <BR> <BR>I had begun to think that it was a custom font. <BR> <BR>I
    have a couple questions:  First, is Opti Packard a Truetype or Type 1 font, or
    does it only appear in the Solotype Catalog?  Second &#40;if Opti Packard does
    not exist in an electronic form&#41;, do I understand you correctly that Packard
    Antique would be the closest electronic form of Opti Packard? <BR> <BR>Thank you!
    <BR> <BR>Once again...I am truly impressed.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: OptiFonts are handled these days by <a href="http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html"
    target="_blank"> Castcraft</a>. <BR> <BR>Their website is, to say the least, outdated
    and the only part that <BR>functions usefully is the Designer Collections link.
    Since Opti <BR>Packard is not in any of the four Designer Collections and the
    <BR>Online Catalog images don&#39;t appear, you would need to contact <BR>Castcraft.
    <BR> <BR>Over the last few years, I&#39;ve contacted them by e-mail 5 times and
    <BR>received a reply once. Hopefully you&#39;ll fare better. I&#39;m sure that
    they <BR>could provide the font in the format of your choosing. <BR> <BR>As to
    which font would be most accurate, it seems likely that the <BR>OptiFont was used.
    Since Dieter Steffmann&#39;s version is free, you <BR>can check it out for yourself.
    It doesn&#39;t fare the best on-screen, so <BR>be sure to print a sample paragraph
    or two to see it on paper, <BR>where it looks splendid. <BR><br>

  body: There was a version called &#39;Paliard&#39; that was made by NovelFonts in
    the mid-90&#39;s but I have been unable to find anywhere that still sells them.
    I found only one site that shows a sample, and it <a href="http://www.professionalinvitations.com/cfont2.htm"
    target="_blank">looks identical</a>.

  body: Great info Mike and Mike. <BR> <BR>$57.50 per font, did I read that correctly?
    <BR> <BR>Does OPTI have a connection to URW? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to see a Foundry
    Flow Chart to see where <BR>all these obscure type companies came from. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Thanks for the info. <BR> <BR>Now...I opened up Steffmann&#39;s Packard Antique
    font with High-Logic&#39;s Font Creator Program and I noticed that there were
    several errors/warnings.  I fixed &#40;very meticulously, mind you&#41; the errors
    and warnings, which included contour directions, redundant points, overlapping
    contours, and a few obvious defects.  I saved my fixed font as a new font file
    &#40;Truetype&#41;. <BR> <BR>What is the best way to handle this in terms of releasing
    this &#34;fixed&#34; version out into the &#34;wild&#34; of the Internet.  Of
    course, I would give Steffmann full credit still, but I would make a note within
    the font that it was a cleaned up version of the font.  Should I name my fixed
    font differently?  Should I even be doing this? <BR> <BR>I was hoping that my
    cleanup work would make the font appear better on screen, but unfortunately, my
    changes had no effect in this regard.  You are right however, that the font looks
    excellent when printed out.

  body: My advice would be to contact Dieter Steffmann before you do anything to distribute
    this &#40;if you just use it yourself that&#39;s up to you&#41;. For one thing,
    Dieter may want to know what changes were made; for another your software may
    &#39;fix&#39; it only so that your software doesn&#39;t see errors/warnings --
    are you sure that makes it compatible with any other similar software, like FontLab
    or Fontographer? <BR> <BR>Anyway, talk to Dieter, is my advice.
