body: "Hi, this is my first post on typophile. You definitely seem like a knowledgeable
  bunch, so here goes:\r\n\r\nI am in the process of designing a typeface for my final
  project at college. My course is in Art & Design and at the end of the year there
  is a show to display all the students completed work.\r\n\r\nMy tutors don\u2019t
  really share my interest in typography. For the show I was thinking of trying a
  few words in [[http://de-war.de/eurekacarpark.html|anamorphic type]] to showcase
  my finished font, mainly because it is more interesting than a font specimen, which
  I had originally planned to do.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m wondering what the best way to go
  about this would be? I found [[http://www.georgemichaelbrower.com/work/anamorphic-type/|
  a interesting little program (see video)]] to help do this, but it\u2019s not available
  to buy or download. Also what medium would suit it best? I\u2019m thinking vinyl,
  but without exact plans for printing I don\u2019t think it would be much use.\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much in advance.\r\n\r\nIain\r\n"

    but likely a poor way to show off a type design.

    your tutors.</strong> They probably want students to do trendy conceptual thesis
    projects that will show well in the show at the end of the semester, get written
    about in design blogs, and boost enrollment. But that\u2019s not your problem.
    It\u2019s your project so if you want to design type and a specimen then design
    type and a specimen.\r\n\r\nMy thesis adviser didn\u2019t want me doing type design
    and a specimen. So I planned a big show display about typography with wall hangings
    and posters to pull out during meetings about my thesis. Then I spent all my time
    on type design, had 1,000 eight-page specimens printed offset, never produced
    the rest of my project, and took a B for the class. I still graduated with honors
    and don\u2019t think about that project any more. "

  body: "Thanks for your responses guys!\r\n\r\nI think you are probably right \u2013
    the best way to showcase the design would be in a proper specimen. There really
    is no point in shoe-horning my project to please everyone.\r\n\r\nBesides, getting
    the anamorphic images perfect could easily become as time consuming as the actual
    type design itself\u2026 Although it does look very cool.\r\n\r\nI suppose for
    the exhibition I could print vinyl letters onto the wall to attract attention,
    and place a bunch of specimens right next to it. \r\n\r\nIain\r\n"

    on how complex your typeface is you could also make some huge specimen posters
    like they do at the KABK shows.</a> It\u2019s not as easy to make them interesting
    with just one weight, but hardly impossible, either."
