  other words: If your teacher wants you to design the type for a single word or phrase,
  with sports as the topic, what direction would you go? Just looking for some suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Theres been plenty of typography styles associated specifically with sports!
    Most famously perhaps Grecian type with american collegiate sports, "baseball
    scripts" or the aggressive, effects-laden big-sans typography of contemporary
    sports team logos. Or metaphorical uses: oblique for speed, heavy for strength,
    type suggesting snow... Or the individual classics, like that Mexico Olympics
    ''68 poster that''s still one of the most recognisable applications of display
    typography of all time.'
