    not it...

  body: "This font is called Strategiche by Halvor Bodin of <a href=\"http://www.superlow.com/\">superlow</a>*,
    which is why it features so prominently on his site! However it doesn't seem to
    be on sale commercially anywhere so emailing him could be a good start.\r\n\r\n*
    I got this information from his site."

    when it will be released, and [[Peter Bruhn]] is not online so I can't ask him
    right now. I'll try to find out how, when and where."

    soon, so Peter reckons Nordic should be available somewhere in June.

  body: "Sandy,\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.characters.nl/index.html?font=nordicnarrow\">Nordic
    Narrow</a> is similar to Superlow but it's not close enough if you ask me. I guess
    <a href=\"http://www.characters.nl/index.html?font=nordica\">Nordic A</a> is more
    close to what you need. \r\n\r\nBoth fonts will be available at Fountain. Nordic
    Narrow will be ready within a week or so, but Nordic A will take a little longer.
    \r\nPlease contact me if I can help you out.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\nwww.characters.nl
