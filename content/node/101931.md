body: "I have this free font provided by EPSON. It's a very old font that used to
  be shipped with printer drivers in the 90s. I can use it in Windows without a problem.
  I now want to use it on my Mac (OSX 10.8) and see that the font name is garbled
  when I install it but the contents in the preview show up fine. I can use it in
  Photoshop alright but I mainly want to use it in MS Word 2011. In Word I can see
  the font listed (name garbled) but can't select it. I tried selecting some text
  and then choosing the font but it defaults to the previously selected font. \r\n\r\nI
  don't know much about fonts but still I tried a more hands-on approach. I downloaded
  TTFEdit and replaced the gabled font name characters with regular ones. After doing
  this the font won't even show up in the font list either in Photoshop or MS Word!
  I tried different things in the editor all with the same outcome.\r\n\r\nI would
  really love to be able to use this font on my mac since it is the only font that
  has the biggest set of japanese kanji in textbook format (strokes that can be clearly
  seen). It's a very good teaching tool and it's free. I can't afford the paid alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe
  actual font name is: EPSON \u6559\u79D1\u66F8\u4F53\uFF2D, pronounced kyoukasho
  tai M, which translates to \"textbook body\".\r\n\r\nHere's the original, unmodified
  font file: [[http://cacaculo.com.ar/epkyouka.ttf|epkyouka.ttf]]\r\n"

  body: Quite a few of the internal font names need to be changed. I don't know how
    much control you have available in TTFEDIT, but in Fontforge, I changed about
    a dozen of the font name instances to EPSON-KYOKASHO and it all now works fine.
    This includes all of the entries that go into what FontLab calls 'Additional Open-Type
    Names'.     - Herb
