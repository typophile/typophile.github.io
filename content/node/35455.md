  find it (maybe i\xB4m using the wrong search terms). \r\n\r\nI need to do the most
  basic thing: get a text to go automatically to the next page. The problem is that
  i don\xB4t know how to relate the two text boxes on both A Master pages (if that\xB4s
  the way to do it).\r\n\r\nI\xB4ll really appreciate your help!\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n\r\nIgnacio"

  body: "The problem is that when i go the page 3 for example and i add the text box,
    i doesn\xB4t relate to the one i add on page 4.\r\n\r\nMaybe i need to add the
    box on the Master pages, but when i do that, i can\xB4t edit the box when going
    to the actual pages."

  body: "If I understand correctly, you want to place a big text file and automatically
    have it \r\nflow from page to page without having to keep selecting the out arrow,
    right?\r\n\r\nIf so, what you do is, on the master page, let's say you have 2
    columns. If you \r\nshift+select the out anchor point (lower right) and then click
    inside \r\nthe next empty column, you have now strung them together.\r\n\r\nNow,
    when you're in your page view, you should be able to place a text file \r\nin
    the first column and it will automatically fill all the pages."

  body: "If you want to edit a master page item you hold command+shift while clicking
    on the item (for Mac users - maybe Bert's answer is for PC users)\r\n\r\nI think
    if you set your files up checking \"Master Text Frame\" this will work too but
    I don't know if you can add that back in after you've already started."

  body: "I slightly misspoke earlier about linking and auto text flow.\r\n\r\nYou
    do link text frames together by clicking the out box and \r\nthen inside the next
    frame.\r\n\r\nBut when in your page view, if you place a file, you hold down \r\non
    the shift key WHILE placing the text. Not like I said earlier.\r\n\r\nThis should
    automatically fill all the text boxes and create new\r\npages till the doc is
    completely placed. \r\n\r\nBut again, you have to link the text boxes together
    on the master page.\r\n\r\nBy the way folks, where is this box \"Master Text Frame\"?
    I don't see where you're \r\ntalking about checking it.\r\n\r\nAnd if I'm understanding
    SubwayDesign's problem, he/she doesn't need \r\nMaster Text Frame checked. \r\n\r\nFrom
    InD help menu:\r\nIf your document requires more variation, such as pages with
    different numbers of frames or frames of different lengths, leave the Master Text
    Frame option deselected."
