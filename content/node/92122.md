body: I know it's Helvetica, I was just wondering if anyone knew the weight(s) of
  the bottom text. I'm also not sure how to properly embed an image, if someone could
  help me with that that'd be awesome!

  body: I think it's a good weight. Any lighter and it might compromise legibility.
    Anyways thanks for the input.

    why the \"B\" is asymmetrical - that's kinda yucky.\r\n(See last one here: http://gmunch.home.pipeline.com/typo-L/cart/arch1.htm)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It\u2019s almost impossible to know given the letterpress treatment. However,
    it looks like something lighter than regular (45 or 35, if it\u2019s Neue).\r\nIf
    you use the Edit link to move the thread up to the main Type ID Board, maybe someone
    else could chime in with suggestions."
