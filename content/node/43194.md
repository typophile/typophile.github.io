    lower case 'e' is an interesting looking character."

  body: Good start but it is a bit hard to read, especially at a smaller size (I imagine
    it would go on stationary, sites etc). I would work more in refining the e+r.
    The "s" needs to open up a bit as well. You might have to exaggerate some of these
    quirkiness so it is readable at that small of a scale.

  body: I found this so hard to read that I started feeling anxious.  Does "deveras"
    mean anything along the lines of Spanish "de veras" or Italian "davvero"?  Because
    your text does not communicate the sense of affirmation,  confidence, or surprise
    that these phrases mean in the languages I mention.  Of course, I am ignorant
    of Portuguese, so I would like to understand the meaning of the word before responding
    further.

  body: Agreed. I had to work out what each letter was even at that size. Focus on
    the readability of your letterforms.

  body: 'I couldn''t read the R. I sat there and tried and tried to figure out what
    it was but it wasn''t clear until I read the comments. Perhaps because the rest
    are lower case. '

  body: "I like it. I think it would stand out from the crowd in a bunch of logos
    for graphic design studios. I think you need to open up the apertures on the Es,
    R and S though to make it more readable. I don't think it would be legible at
    small sizes in it's current form.\r\n\r\nNice work. Did you create this from the
    beginning?\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: "hello guys ! thanks for the opinions and tips... yes, this lettering isnt
    so easy to read...it was my goal (hehhe).... and i thinks the problems you mentioned
    are real...\r\n\r\nDEVERAS is an oldfashioned word that means \"real, true, that\xB4s
    it\".... something like: \"he DOES like the ramones...\" or \"...i liked this
    band from its VERY beginning...\" its an affirmation...did you get that ?\r\n\r\nim
    so busy, so i will post the logo updated with the considerations you made here!
    thanks\r\n\r\nrlynch: i created it from the beginning...thanks for the nice words\r\n\r\nsorry
    bout the bad english...im still learning to write ! lol\r\n\r\ndiogo (hugs from

  body: The expression in english would be "true that." I think it's a great choice.

  body: "The changes you made really don't help.  Perhaps it's a matter of personal
    preference, but I don't like it.  Imagine if an engine block, a library and Ms.
    Pac Man had a baby: this would be the type that you could use for the baby's name.
    \ And as Paul just said, it's still hard to read.\r\n\r\nI suggest you go back
    to the drawing board on this one.\r\n\r\n---\r\nNick Hladek"
