body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI'm a freelance graphic designer. I was hoping if I could
  get a little advice on font licensing and such. I'm keen to keep everything legit,
  but find it a little confusing.\r\n\r\nOver the few years that I've been working
  in the industry, I've accumulated a lot of fonts - from other designers, clients,
  print houses etc. I understand that I can't legally use fonts that I do not own
  the license for, and that's absolutely fine. The problem is, I've sorta lost track
  of which fonts I can/can't legally use.\r\n\r\nSome time back, I was working on
  a client project that used a lot of Din Condensed. At the time, I had a copy of
  the font installed on my system, but had not yet purchased the license - I have
  no idea where I picked up the copy along the way. My intention was to keep working
  on the job using the (unlicensed) font and then buy a license before final delivery
  to the client.\r\n\r\nThe thing is I couldn't seem to find the font with the EXACT
  same name - 'DinCond'. In the end, I opted to buy the nearest thing I could find,
  which was the 'Din OT Condensed' family, and removed the original unlicensed version
  from my system. \r\n\r\nBut I'm doubting myself a little now - for example: inDesign
  can't find the font I originally used because the name is slightly different, even
  though the set I bought <em>looks</em> identical.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n-
  Does the licensed copy that I purchased cover me, even though the name itself is
  slightly different?\r\n\r\n- Generally speaking, what can happen if it turns out
  I've used a font in the past that I didn't realise was unlicensed?\r\n\r\nAny advice
  would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nDee"

  body: "To answer your first question. It depends. There are more than one DIN out
    there, and they come from various resellers. Unless it was the exact same font
    \u2014 in this case if it were an OT update of the old font \u2014\_you don\u2019t
    own a license to the first font.\r\n\r\nBtw, the dialog Indesign shows when you
    don\u2019t have the correct font installed allows you to redfine all your styles
    using the old font in just a few clicks. \r\n\r\n<em>\u201C\u2026 what can happen
    if it turns out I've used a font in the past that I didn't realise was unlicensed?\u201D</em>\r\nThere
    have been some cases of big corporations recieving lawsuits, but in most cases
    I\u2019d guess the type designer would just ask you to license the font. I can\u2019t
    really answer for others, and I\u2019m not a professional anyway.\r\nI don\u2019t
    question your motives asking this question, but in general I think respecting
    the hard work of a fellow designer by not stealing it is just plain good for you,
    for the client, for the design industry and for the type designer."

  body: "Thanks a million for the reply. Regarding the Din font question - what you're
    saying makes perfect sense to me. The difficulty is I can't seem to actually find
    the exact same font so that I can buy it. Pretty frustrating, as I'm perfectly
    happy to buy the license, but all I can find is variations! So in the interest
    of 'being legit', I figured it would be best to buy whatever I could. At least
    that way I 'tried'.\r\n\r\nI guess this type of thing is pretty common, huh? I
    know there are a lot of small-fry freelancers like me out there that don't pay
    much attention to font licensing.. at least in the early days. I guess as I start
    to earn more money from my work, I'd like to gradually obtain licenses for anything
    I may have neglected in the past - it's just confusing with all the variations.\r\n\r\nI
    mean, there seems to be dozens of different Helvetica. And I really have no idea
    how many of them I have used in previous jobs. Some legit; some almost certainly
    not. The font is just so ubiquitous - I swear I seem to accumulate different versions
    of it without even trying :)\r\n\r\nShould I be worried about that type of thing,
    or would you say I am being overly cautious?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    at some point. I find random commercial fonts on my system all the time with no
    clue where they came from, my best guess is that they were installed with software
    that didn\u2019t clean up after itself when I got rid of it. You did make an effort
    to license something, that\u2019s a lot more than most people do."
