body: "I'm wondering if there are any distressed, weathered, grunge, etc. typefaces
  made for huge sizes (200-400 pt.). I am considering using one for a newspaper section
  flag, and a distressed effect that works at normal display sizes may look artificial
  at that scale. The necessary amount of detail may not be readily available in a
  single font, so I'm also looking into distressing type myself in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nI
  am also open to other broken, highly detailed typefaces along the lines of <a href=http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-39-preissig>Preissig</a>
  or <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=CTT0000113>Arlt 7
  Locos</a>."

    the effect at that size.  Check out Mr.Retro's Machine Wash Filters;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.misterretro.com/image_filters.html\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: Thanks, Simon. I had actually looked into Machine Wash thanks to another Typophile
    thread, so using those filters is definitely a strong possibility. But I'm still
    curious if there's any type that would fit the bill out of the box.

  body: "One of the best ways to get a large distressed type with ease is to print
    out the type on a3 paper and then go to town on the paper its self. Just crunch
    it up rub it against walls etc... then flatten the paper and scan it back into
    photoshop to do the rest!\r\n\r\nI've done this and seen it been done to great
    effects without it looking fake!"

    how I did the type in this image, it would be good enough to print the billboard

  body: In the 'Frank' family I did for Precision Type ages ago there was a dot-distressed
    version of Franklin Gothic bold (extra?) condensed that I never released because
    it would have had to be blown up to several hundred points to have the dots be
    visible so it was impossible to show in the catalogue. (This was a fairly automatic
    process thanks to a macro Yuri Yarmola kindly wrote for me for in Fontlab 2.5
    language.) I very much like the suggestion of crinkling paper -- imagine the different
    effects one could get depending on the texture of the paper. Another thing that
    that can work nicely is multiple re-xeroxing. Combine that with multiple re-crinkling
    and you could be getting some nice effects.

  body: "What KIND of distressing are you aiming for?\r\n\r\nI agree with others...a
    tried and true method is to print your type on a crappy laser printer on the crappiest
    paper you can find, scratch it, crinkle it, photocopy it 10 times, etc.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're looking for hand-printed, actually get it typeset by a letterpress shop.\r\n\r\nGraffiti/street,
    make a stencil and get some spray paint.\r\n\r\nPlay with an ink jet printer with
    bad inks + water\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks a ton, everyone, for all your suggestions. It seems like, excluding
    Bill's dotted Frank font, there really isn't much already-made type in the vein
    I'm looking for. But I'm going to distress the type myself using a stone texture.
    We actually already have a prototype version we like, so once the new <a href=http://garciamedia.com/blog/articles/canadas_national_post_balconies_with_an_ad_view/><em>Yale
    Daily News</em></a> launches, I'll try to remember to post the final version here.
