  body: "Sounds more like Norah relied on a font that, last time I was in SF, every
    third food-related business was using. I swear, Papyrus really is becoming <em>the</em>
    font for food identities done on no budget. I\u2019ve seen it used for the menus
    and identities of every class and variety of restaurant, bakery, caterer, etc..
    If I walk over to Barnes & Noble I bet that the \u201CHow to Start Your Own Food
    Business\u201D book shows a set of sample designs that are done in Papyrus."
