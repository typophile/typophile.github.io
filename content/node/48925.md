  body: "logo: I'm pretty sure it's a custom job - the shape of the \"o\" isn't really
    something any self-respecting font designer would do. But it works ok as a logo,
    as it's pretty much all geometrically constructed letterforms.\r\n\r\nrest of
    site: I haven't compared it against samples, but I get a strong vibe of Chalet,
    fairly heavily modified. Could be one of a number of other similar sans serifs,
    or (possibly) a completely custom job, though."
