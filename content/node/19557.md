  I'm not really liking the name or the logo. I like the concept behind it, but I
  can't help but think \"wee\". And I don't think the characters have been designed
  and spaced very well either, they don't seem to fit togther nicely.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?"

    in this realm for a while, with name brands that attempt to be universal, by not
    coming directly from any one language (think AIWA)."

    altough i know WWII as an abreviation (mainly because i talk to alot of english
    speaking people over the internet), WWII isnt a used abreviation outside US/UK
    i think. at least its not in german, and i highly doubt the french would use an
    english abreviation. thus \"Wii looks like WWII for europeans\" isnt really valid
    at all. \r\n\r\ni really like the name. revolution? thats SUCH a boring name for
    an electronic device. and whats the name of the next console by nintendo? revolution,

  body: "First the logo: while at first I didn't especially love it, especially the
    width and feeling of slowness (at least for me) of the W, I'm now growing to like
    it a bit more, especially when it's compared to the <a href=http://www.ps3rules.com/ps3-images/ps3-screenshots/ps3-logo.jpg>PS3</a>
    and <a href=http://www.eurogamer.net/assets/articles/a58844/a_med_allegedxbox360leakedlogo.jpg>X360</a>
    logos. To me, the logo sets the console apart; there is such a difference between
    the more angular PS3 and X360 logos and this one that you can't help but think
    that Nintendo's system is different (for better of worse...).\r\n\r\nBriefly on
    the name: I actually don't hate it. While of course the first thought that came
    to my mind was the bodily fluid (makes me feel very mature...), I think that the
    most important thing about it is that it's distinct. While \"Revolution\" did
    communicate the essential idea about the system, it does blend together a bit
    too much with the other names...think about the potential mixup between \"360\"
    and \"Revolution.\" While Revolution wasn't anywhere near bad, Nintendo really
    wants to set itself apart from the field, which is obvious if you take a look
    at the current concepts for the console.\r\n\r\nI also just found (I think via
    Gamespot, but I'm not sure) a <a href=http://www.snarkhunting.com/2006/04/nintendo-wii-brilliant/#comments>blog
    post</a> that suggests that the whole \"Wii\" thing is a giant publicity stunt,
    a la \"I love bees.\" It makes a compelling point, but I feel like Nintendo wouldn't
    have made such a strong point for it in their press release if it were just a
    hoax."

    write up about the logo on the other sites mentioned is interesting... Wii as
    \"we\" and the \"ii\" viewed uniquely as two human forms or more so the new controllers
    developed for the \"revolution.\" \r\n\r\nI can't say I'm all that enamored with
    the logo either, but I've seen much worse. It would have been interesting if they
    followed a more Web 2.0 approach to the name and kept all the points rounded (arial
    rounded?!) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wii_5856.gif]"

    I love type, don't know much about it... I did subscribe the RSS and have been
    watching you go on about it, though, and \"I'm lovin' it!\"\u2122\r\n\r\nAbout
    wii... well, I must say I didn't like the name at first -- lets be honest, I rejected
    it immediately --, but now that I know the concept behind the idea, it is growing
    in me... so, the name is OK. In a bit of a strange way, it actually fits the product
    (though I think they could probably have taken a more serious approach to it).
    But I'd probably like it even better if they hadn't come up with such a \"toyish\"
    looking logo... it also reminded me immediately of other things, so much that
    when I took a first glance at it, it didn't even make me stop for a while \u2013-
    as one of us does -\u2013 because I just thought it was an old \"over and over
    again\" logo from some wi-fi protocol or something like that. It surely doesn't
    seem like a strong enough kind of image for such a risky kind of product. Have
    you seen it? It really is a shot at changing the way we play...\r\n\r\nThe logo
    actually makes me feel like we've been there and done that. Reminds me of Intel's
    viiv, reminds me of Sony's VAIO -- the wave with the straight edges that is the
    W in wii and the VA in VAIO, mostly -- and of their whole communication style,
    and also... I'm sure I've seen that same WI somewhere else but I just can't quite
    put my finger on it... so it's clear: they should probably take a bit of a walk
    on the wild side. The name doesn't help with that, either.\r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand... maybe that's their whole idea! They make it look like anything else and
    everything else so that we absorb it without even noticing! Hahaha! xD (not)\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>(I
    need to come up with an original signature)</em>"
