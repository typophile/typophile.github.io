body: "So i've been working on my first typeface in fontlab for the last 6 months
  or so, and I have a quick ligature question.\r\n\r\nI've designed a few simple ligatures,
  /fi/ /ffi/ /fl/, but was wondering what people do when dealing with tracking of
  the font in-use? Lets say someone is designing a book with my typeface, and they
  track out a whole block of text to 20, or maybe -20; all the type will look correct
  but the ligatures because they have a predefined spacing because it is a specific
  character.\r\n\r\nIs there any way in fontlab through some fancy opentype coding
  to tell it, \"use these ligatures up until the user changes the tracking past -10,
  or +10\"? Is that just too complicated of a task for an opentype feature? \r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: I can't claim to be an expert on the matter but, AFIK, fonts aren't built
    with feedback mechanisms, so your problem can't be solved through programming...

  body: Yes this is a complicated issue in OTLF. So maybe you need a lot of ligature
    behavior. IMHO

  body: There are some limit controls in Adobe apps. I haven't done this in awhile,
    but I think if you track them far enough apart it turns off the ligature feature
    where the tracking is.

  body: "Here's what James Felici has to say:\r\n<blockquote>The same thing occurs
    when character spacing is altered. For instance, if you open up the tracking of
    a text passage containing ligatures, InDesign will drop the ligatures in favor
    of their constituent characters and open their spacing accordingly. The same thing
    happens when tracking is tightened, because otherwise the fixed spacing between
    the component elements of the ligature would stand out in contrast to the spacing
    of their neighbors. Ditto for justified type, where spacing has to be stretched
    or squeezed to fit type into fully filled lines. <strong>When a certain, rather
    small, spacing threshold has been crossed, InDesign will revert to handling the
    ligatures\u2019 constituent parts as independent characters.</strong> Hand kerning
    can also cause ligatures to disappear.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSource: http://layersmagazine.com/the-art-of-type-ligatures-fusion-power.html"
