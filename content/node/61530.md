  body: "I know what you\u2019re talking about. You don\u2019t like Bembo\u2019s long
    leg of R, so you\u2019re trying an alternate, right?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to
    tell, since the color of the new R can be slightly different from Bembo. I don\u2019t
    know if it is a good solution, but why don\u2019t you choose another font? I was
    thinking in [[http://www.fonts.com/ES/detail.htm?pid=4334871&grab_id=0&page_id=4375&query=poliphilus&SCOPE=Fonts|Poliphilus]]
    & [[http://www.fonts.com/ES/detail.htm?pid=4334844&grab_id=0&page_id=8826&query=Blado&SCOPE=Fonts|Blado]].
    Same source of inspiration, no strange legs. Some other strange letters, though."

  body: There's no automated method of changing it, as far as I can tell, though.
    You should consider that.

    by turning on Stylistic Alternates.
