  pages which is print and web based. Im looking for a several fonts that I can use
  throughout the book. The school uses Times New Roman as its 'Brand' Logo font and
  would like to keep it. Would anyone like to give some suggestions of what i could
  team it with or even some way of making it look right?!! Last year I played around
  with Verdana for main body text just for web advantage with some degree of success.\r\n\r\nAny
  feeds would be greatly received.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nGMan"

    plagued the earth since the advent of digital typography.\r\n\r\nTimes is a tested
    workhorse, but it lacks all flavour.  For Times, I'd really recommend you using
    it larger than you'd regularly use it.  Times can be quite beautiful at large
    sizes.  Try spicing it up by not using black and white, but a grey (with a decent
    enough contrast to be read easily on whatever background you choose, at least
    a 40% difference in tone, 60% is best)\r\n\r\nI assume this is mainly a black
    and white book?\r\n\r\nWhat I'd recommend, and this is opinion, but choose only
    2 typefaces for the entire book, and stick to them.  I'd recommend a serif and
    a sans serif.  You have Times chosen for you already.\r\n\r\nGo through the sans-serif
    typefaces you have and see what pairs well with Times, and to feel them you have
    to get both of them big on your screen.\r\n\r\nAlso, once you start designing
    the pages, print them out and touch the pages, rotate the pages, flip them upside
    down and just look at the shapes of the letters.  When you print a typeface it
    becomes tactile, it has a different feel.\r\n\r\nI'm sure, if you were to being
    designing the yearbook, you could upload a layout page to the forum and get a
    critique on it and some better adive once we all see how you're using it.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck with your yearbook, that's a fun and important project!"

    forum to get some feed back. The yearbook is full colour which i guess will give
    another dimension to work with choosing a limited palette so not to get to busy.
    \r\n cheers\r\nfor now\r\n\r\nG"

  body: "well, if I was going to be doing a yearbook, one tool I'd have in my little
    box of tricks is this:\r\n\r\nVector illustrations!\r\n\r\nI don't know what software
    you plan on using for the yearbook \u2014 I would be doing it in indesign.\r\n\r\nOne
    tool that is invaluable is a lot of high-quality vector illustrations, and I use
    two main sources for mine because they aer quality, free and consistent.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.oxygen-icons.org\">Oxygen icon set</a>\r\n\r\nthis is a pretty
    awesome set, and you can snag the colour palette from their site and use that
    in your layouts so the layout colours match the illustrations.  For somebody who
    has little or moderate experience at this, this will save you time, stress and
    let you sleep at night because a designer better than me or you has chosen colours
    that work for us in advance :-)\r\n\r\nIt can be sneaky to get the icons, because
    you have to check them out of SVN or find a download of them elsewhere, but they're
    licenced to open-source so you're free to use and modify them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/figure4_6738.png]\r\noxygen
    palette\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://tango.freedesktop.org\">Tango Project</a>\r\n\r\nthis
    icon set uses more a more trendy and limited palette, but there are less icons
    available.  They are also open-source and free to use for any purpose, so go nuts
    and check them out, you've got nothing to lose!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tango-Palette_4729.png]\r\ntango
    palette\r\n\r\nHope these resources will help you, I know I refer to them or their
    colours palettes on almost every project I do!  \r\n\r\nBest of luck to you!"

    InDesignCS3 is absolutely the only tool to use and with a couple of tweeks and
    additions could make illustrator vanish. I also have a couple of colour tools
    i'll share as i find them ex useful. \r\n\r\ncheers again\r\n\r\nG"
