body: "I\u2019m typesetting a German-language book which \u2013 somewhat atypically
  \u2013 uses initial dashes (instead of quotation marks) for direct speech. I\u2019ve
  been asked to use this system before, typically in translations from Scandinavian
  languages where this is, I believe, more common. In this case it\u2019s the author\u2019s
  preference.\r\nHere is an example from this current book \u2013 the second paragraph
  is dialogue:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dash_4524.gif]\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
  there are some names, terms and expressions that are typeset in guillemets throughout
  the book. So far, so good, but now the question has come up <em>what happens when
  such a guillemet-quoted expression stands within the dash-led direct speech</em>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/guil2_6147.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  editor and the proofreader think that it should be just single guillemets because
  they\u2019re nested within direct speech. On the other hand, my line of reasoning
  so far is that the nested ones would only need to be reduced to singles if they\u2019re
  nested within actual <em>guillemets</em>, so that the levels of guillemets don\u2019t
  get confused. Since we\u2019re not using guillemets for direct speech, this does
  not apply. \r\nIn other words \u2013 I think the replacement of double guillemets
  with single ones is determined by typography (nesting within other quotes), while
  they think it\u2019s a semantic thing (nesting within direct speech).\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  someone more familiar with this practice can shed some light on the issue? I\u2019d
  be thankful."

  body: "A tad more logical but more out of random preference I would probably use
    the singles too. There is the \u201Csemantic use\u201D of single quotation marks
    for emphasize or to highlight explanations for things that aren\u2019t quotes.
    But that case doesn\u2019t really apply here, or does it? I don\u2019t know of
    any \u201Crules\u201D for such a case. Typesetting guidelines are more about helpful
    conventions than rules anyway, so just do what you think will be understood most
    easily by the reader."

    thanks, Indra.\r\n\r\n(And no, the semantic differentiation of singles for things
    like technical terms or titles that aren\u2019t really \u201Cspeech\u201D does
    not apply here. Fortunately we don\u2019t have any such standalone single quotes
    in this book.)"

  body: Nina, your logic makes more sense to me, but in those images that dash looks
    so slight that the relatively showy normal (double) guillemets threaten to jump
    out of the hierarchy to my eyes, which might push me towards using the single
    ones.

  body: 'I''d agree with Craig, those dashes could do with being more prominent, whichever
    way you decide to go. To my mind, if you''re using double ones in the surrounding
    non-dialogue text, I''d say it''s more consistent to stick to one variant, the
    double, throughout, rather than have double in text and single in dialogue. '

  body: 'Thinking as an editor, I would agree with your typographic logic: single
    guillemets indicate nesting within guillemets, not nesting within discourse. Thinking
    as a typesetter, I would prefer em-dashes rather than en-dashes for the dialogue,
    if possible. But my opinions are very Anglophone; I don''t really know how German-speakers
    perceive these things.'

  body: "Thanks all so far.\r\n\r\nOn the dashes, I agree (and realize) that they\u2019re
    relatively short, but in this/our German/Swiss context this is actually quite
    welcome \u2013 em-dashes would definitely be over the top. Craig\u2019s point
    on what that means for the visual hierarchy with the guillemets does give me pause
    though\u2026 hmm. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that Frode (or whoever is
    handling the Monokrom  account) has commented on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/monokromfonts/status/345271391819546624\">Twitter</a>
    that double guillemets would be commonly used with the dashes in Norwegian (which
    uses both dashes and guillemets) \u2013 so there\u2019s a precedent.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll
    see the editor today & we\u2019ll have a (presumably final) talk about it :)"

    are probably free to define something else. '

  body: "Dramatic change of perspective: We have changed <em>all</em> guillemets in
    the text \u2013 within direct speech or no \u2013 to single ones :)\r\n\r\nUpon
    further inspection of what actually is inside those quotes (thanks for this question
    on Twitter, Frode), we (editor + I) realized they\u2019re all book titles, names
    of restaurants and other such things that can easily be quoted in single guillemets
    as well. Changing them to singles also makes them less loud visually (thanks for
    that, Craig), makes them not feel weird inside direct speech (where most readers
    will be used to seeing single ones) while still maintaining consistency between
    quoted and not quoted text (as I wanted it). \r\n\r\nErgo, everyone happy, problem
    solved. Thanks, all!\r\n"

    of book titles, names etc \u2026 As long as the language is not German, these
    might already stand out enough because they usually are written with initial caps.
    When that does not stand out enough, you could also consider to write them in
    italics (as long as that does not conflict with other uses of italic within the
    document)"

  body: It's probably too late, but in Sweden it'd also be double quotation marks
    within a dash-indicated direct speech passage. But then we hardly use quotations
    marks at all, except when quoting text or as scare quotes. Possibly for song titles.
