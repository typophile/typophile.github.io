  (save for the 2-storey 'a' and the binocular 'g', I assume). I am confused by the
  cyrillic 'De' character. It looks pretty awkward to write. What's the deal? The
  rest of the characters look simple enough.\r\n\r\n- Chris"

  body: "even <em>the 2-storey \u2018a\u2019 and the binocular \u2018g\u2019</em>
    have handwritten origins. take a look at the [[carolingian minuscule]] and you'll
    see both in a calligraphic hand. the same is true for [[cyrillic]] letters: they
    were all based on handwritten models. It is true that some were tweaked to become
    the cyrillic alphabet we are used to seeing today, but  even the old [[poluustav]]
    models correlate quite strongly with the forms that are used today. To better
    understand where these letter forms are coming from, i'd recomment [[Vladimir
    Yefimov]]'s article on \"[[Civil Type]] and Kis Cyrillic,\" which can be found
    in [[Language Culture Type]]."

  body: "Every character has a largely chirographic, but also some lapidary*, origin.
    But the future? That's up to us. And in something like the Cyrillic De, it might
    in fact be a good time to reform it (although pragmatically, always).\r\n\r\n*
    Consider for example that the Greeks made entire letterform stems and such with
    single strikes of the chisel (see Catich).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
