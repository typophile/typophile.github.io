    by [[http://yomaraugusto.com|Yomar Augusto]]. This one is more recent and looks
    like to be derived from Unity.

  body: "To Luzzy, As you can see both of your posts have the same title. What if
    you asked for ten different team logos the same way? How would you know which
    was which? \r\n\r\nPlease use a more specific title, like \"Uniform letters for
    Real Madrid\". Then we can tell which ones we are looking for when we try to answer
    them, and you know which ones to look at.\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
