  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm very early in my process, but I want to have some conversation to help get the juices flowing.

This is a logo for a cabinetmaker who does a wide range of high end pieces: humidors, large dining tables, custom desks, built-ins, kitchens, etc.  His designs range from staid, traditional pieces, to art deco and ultra-modern.  His process involves the collaboration with many shops, so he has dubbed his brand, "Whelan Artisans."  He wants to give the idea of traditional craft that is also forward-looking and sustainable, and suggested two whales in a circle formation.

Here is my initial treatment.  He liked Garamond, although I have my misgivings about it.  Also, I modeled the animal after a blue whale, although I'm thinking a humpback might be more dramatic.  I haven't invested a huge amount of time, but I would like some initial impressions.  And don't be bashful about ripping into it.  That's why I'm posting it - to be refined in the typophile fire.

		<div class="commentbody">Will either the logomark or the logotype be added to the furniture?  If so, how?

As is, the lack of line-weight changes in the whales bothers me - looks computer-y and decidedly unartisanal.  However, if it's meant to be an outline for carving into wood, that's a different story.

The big W bothers me, especially with the logomark - the styles of the mark and the logotype seem way to different.

So... Whales?  Whelan?  Is that the connection?


Thanks for sharing your logo-in-process!</div>

I can see that equating to the whales. Even if not, two whales is certainly memorable. I like it.

I agree about the line weight. Could you try mixing the line weights? Maybe use two weights similar to the type.

I'd also like to see it sans 'artisans'. Seems unnecessary. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">First off, thank you everyone for your very helpful comments.

@eeblet:  Your advice for working with line weights is well taken.  I started from a sketch, but midway through the digital process I did sense that humpback whales might be better and if this direction turned out to be garbage, I didn't want to have spent precious time fine-tuning lines for a direction I would ultimately abandon.  Also, the whale : Whelan link is coincidental; should I steer the client away from what may possibly come across as a hackneyed phonemic association?

@Paul, BigWave: Basically, the client really likes whales, and he's kind of a crunchy, Grateful Dead type of guy.  I think it suits his personality well, and since partly he's selling himself with this logo, I think it fits.  His shop is in Northern California (about 2 hours north of San Francisco) and there is a considerable amount of whale-watching in the coastal part of the county, so I think the whales make sense geographically as well.

@ellason: Yeah, I notice the goofy smile, too.  If you ask me, that's the problem with these damned porpoises; (to me, at least) they all look like that have a stupid grin.  Again, another reason to try out a humpback whale, since they have less of a scoopy, smiley thing going on up front.

I'll return once I integrate and elaborate.

		<div class="commentbody">Our school is called the Nantucket Whalers and with the whaling industry history here we see lots of whale logos, most commonly the tail coming out of waves. I like the fact that you aren't using a wood plane or other similar item for a wood worker's logo. I also like having two whales since you are talking about more than one person. I don't like the type choice. I think it is too stiff for an artisan, especially the W. I think the questions about how this will be used are important - wood cuts? letterpress?

		<div class="commentbody">@Sharon: I'm glad you like the whale direction.  The client and I agreed that the tail coming out the water was not a direction we wanted to go.  This logo primarily will be used on a website, and maybe later be developed into a business card, letterhead and a decal for the side of his van.  And I'm looking into other type choices.

		<div class="commentbody">Once line-weight changes are introduced (and yes, the logo burned into the wood would be awesome - it's what I thought you were getting at!), I like the logomark - not logically associated, but it doesn't matter.  Distinctive and nice are more important.  The logotype, however, has got to chance, *especially* for NorCal, I think.  Something more humanist or even hippy-ish (just a tad - no Hobo) would make the whales more sensical.

I am excited to see what you come up with!  Also, does this guy need web design from a semi-local?  I'm moving in a week and would love to barter for furniture.  ;)

		<div class="commentbody">Quick question: when folks are saying "humanist" type, are they thinking more modern sans type, or traditional, Venetian serif?  If they mean the latter, I agree; if they mean the former, I don't.  The mark needs to communicate a sense of time-honored craft, which fits more with the Venetian-style humanist fonts, if you ask me.  Any opinions?

In this instance, they're probably referring to a font that has more personality, than the cold, mechanical face you've used. While the face you choose does retain at timely classical, almost regal style, it's not very personable.</div>

Then I paired with humanist serifs and put them inside a bounding box to give a sense of what a wood imprint might look like.

Here are links to the:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fpcukiah.org/misc/whale_detail.26.04.2008.png">Whale detail</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fpcukiah.org/misc/whelan_26.04.2008.png">Logo and type</a></li>

The fonts in the logo and type images are Aphasia, Centaur, Albertus and Amanda for A, B, C, and D respectively.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the issue I'm having is in the line weights.  The bumps, eye line thing, and mouth, all have far too much weight....  I'd personally take a brush and ink or a responsive pen (my favorite cheapo pen is the Pilot P77) and draw a few whales, noticing what weights look right.  I'd also try freehand drawing method both whales to see what differences work in the upper & lower whale - the radial symmetry is unorganic, and looks odd.

		<div class="commentbody">I have an issue with the marriage of the 2, both symbol and typography. It would seem that the smooth curvaceous lines of the whales, mixed with the stern upright and sharp typography, present an uncomfortable match. 

Perhaps one way of unifying the two would be to add some treatment to the crossbars of the 'H' and 'A' to bring some of them smooth abstract lines in to the typography to have more of a unity between the two.

That said, it certainly has the potential to be a good marque.</div>
