  what this font might be? This style of lettering is fairly typical of prison tattoo
  work. (Obviously, since it's a prison tattoo, it's definitely hand-lettered!!!)
  But perhaps you could suggest something that's reasonably close to it. Perhaps some
  of you forum members who are currently behind bars might have a unique insight!\r\nThanks,

    Tom Carnase and Tony Di Spigna weild mighty quills penning impromtu ornate scripts
    as well. The beauty of these pieces are that the flourishes are integrated within
    the characters and words used, which is virtually impossible to create using a
    type font.\r\n\r\nYou can get close using the swirly <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-edwardian-script/edwardian-scr-itc/index.html\"

    for effortlessly cranking out graceful script... To watch him do this with a sloppy,
    wet watercolor brush was quite impressive.  Alas, I did not inherit his talent,
    so digital typography is a fortuitous path for me! \r\nDK~"
