body: "Dear,\r\n\r\nI'm going to compose the lay-out my first essay. It is as essay
  which concerns some authors of XVII century. Some parts will be in Italian, other
  ones in Latin and few paragraphs will be in hieroglyphics (I found a free set of
  hyero. on the Internet)!\r\n\r\nFor my past books I used Simoncini Garamond, New
  Baskerville, Sabon, but for this one I would like to use a new typeface set (or
  more than one).\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestion?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: well, you'd better find a classical typeface with great real-italics

  body: I think a neo-classical typeface would work even better. But I think a better
    question is what do the hieroglyphics look like? If we could see a sample of those
    perhaps that would spark some conversation.

  body: "Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nI just found one complete set of hieroglyphics. This
    set is quite modern...\r\nAn image of this set \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hgly_6348.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    don't know if to use a neo-classical typeface like Bodoni or Didot, because many
    people find these typefaces too tiring to read and maybe these neoclassical sets
    are not suitable for texts about XVII century.\r\nI like Garamond from Adobe or
    New Baskerville, but I'm unsure yet...\r\n\r\nIf you know other complete set of
    hiero. feel free to advise me."

  body: 'This sample is begging for something more modern than Garamond, though I
    do understand your line of thinking. You could always use the optically correct
    size of Didot (Hoefler) or Bodoni (ITC) and it would be easier to read. '

  body: Late in the game now, but if you're still looking for hieroglyphics, there's
    <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/hieroglyphic/>P22 Hieroglyphic</a>, though
    I have no idea whether it's complete or useful for your purposes. It does have
    more of a hand-drawn character to it than the sample you posted above.
