body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI did a logo for a condo about 4 years ago (pre-well-rounded
  design education...) utilizing a dafont special (roughly a copycut of futura).\r\n\r\nThe
  client just emailed me to inform me they're changing their lightboxes etc, so there's
  opportunity to swap in a better typeface.\r\n\r\nI ran through the usual suspects,
  wasn't wild about any. Started getting away from geometrics and grotesques to the
  quirky dutch guys (quadraat, documenta, scala) and these didn't quite seem to fit
  either.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nCondos are in a relatively revitalized bohemian
  neighbourhood in Vancouver, Canada. Concrete with a bit of exposed wood, decorative
  plaster lobby and hallways. Demographic is fairly young semi-professionals (nurses,
  teachers, burgeoning business owners etc)."

  body: That would be unwise, as the design relies on the congruence of the coloured
    discs and the circular bowl of "d" and "a".
