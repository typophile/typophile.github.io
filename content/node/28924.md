    presume they switched to Latin at some time - in which case\r\nI'd like to find
    out more about that. Does anybody know anything?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Nope. It's Balinese script, an evolution of the \"original Hindu alphabet\"
    that you mentioned. The Sanskrit that we all know was brought to Indonesia at
    approximately 75 AD and eventually evolved to a more localized variant, the Palawa.
    This was the official alphabet of Indonesia's many Hindu kingdoms.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    not until the reign of Purnawarman (at approximately 4th century AD), did we have
    an official record of Hindu as a state religion in Java. Bali, for its comparatively
    small size, got its Hindu influence much earlier and was able to maintain Hindu's
    tradition to this day, even alongside Buddhism and then Islam.\r\n\r\nThe evolution
    from Palawa to its local variants -- like Balinese or Javanese script -- then,
    is a gradual one. Currently, we have an official record of the translation of
    the <em>Mahabarata</em> from Palawa into Javanese script on the reign of Dharmawangsa
    (1000 AD). Thus, most historians believe that Palawa's many variants must've been
    used extensively much earlier than that, at approximately 600 AD.\r\n\r\nI'd be
    happy to get more facts into this topic if you're interested. I'm not from Bali,
    but I'm a native of East Java, so the island is just a 45-minute plane ride away
    (which is kind of nice, if you ask me :)"

  body: "A Javanese Typophiler - yay! :-)  Thanks for the mini lesson.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing on that Omniglot page is confusing:\r\n\"The Balinese alphabet ... is mainly
    used for religious works. Generally a version of the Latin alphabet known as Tulisan
    Bali is used instead... Although Tulisan Bali is a required subject in Balinese
    primary schools, most people promptly forget it afterwards.\"\r\nThis seems to
    imply that Balinese are functionally illiterate!\r\n\r\nSo what do Balinese generally
    write in, and what's the real story with use of Latin?\r\nAnd when did Tulisan
    Bali come about, and who sanctioned/promoted it?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "'Tulisan' in Bahasa Indonesia literally means 'writing'. I don't know if
    there are two variants of the Balinese scripts (one for religious works, one for
    casual uses). But what I do know is that, much like in Java, kids are required
    to study and be able to write traditionally. I used to be able to write in Javanese
    script fluently, back in elementary school.\r\n\r\nHowever, the standard language
    of choice remains Bahasa Indonesia, an Indo-Malayan language -- written in Latin
    alphabets -- that was a derivative of Sumatran, and which writing system was introduced
    during the Dutch colonization (1600's AD).\r\n\r\nIn the name of unity (and to
    overthrow the many oppressors of the country), the language was used as one of
    the tool of national pride. So it only made sense that the practicality of using
    a traditional script in 'real-world' situation soon became trivial. The regional
    variety of Bahasa, then, is what most people ended up speaking, especially because
    'latinizing' and then assimilating the script into the mother language is quite
    easy.\r\n\r\nIn short, everyone writes in regular alphabet and speaks in Bahasa
    Indonesia in formal situations (and in informal ones, a fusion of Bahasa and localspeak).
    But for the sake of tradition (which is a good thing, really), regional scripts
    and traditional language continued to be taught in school.\r\n\r\nAnd believe
    me, that's only a small part of the story (now that you got me going :)"
