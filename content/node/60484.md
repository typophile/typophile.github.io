  \"international\" instantly screamed \"Neuropol, fool!\", but whilst it's close
  [as are a few other Larabie's], isn't. Trademarker [FF] is also close, but no cigar.\r\n\r\nThe
  nu-image bit? No Idea... Assuming it might be a custom made, but I've seen similar
  elsewhere in the form of Bello, but still can't get a match.\r\n\r\nCheers all,\r\n\r\ns"
