  body: 'although I think the font is similar or perhaps a dirivitive of Truth, it
    isn&#39;t quite the same. Upon further investigation, it looks as though it could
    be a mixture of more than one typeface. I&#39;m almost positive I&#39;ve seen
    the exact typeface somewhere, T-26 maybe? '

    may be a better representation. Thoughts?

  body: <i>&#62; Thoughts?</i> <BR> <BR>TTTruth Heavy Slanted, stretched 150%, tracked
    250/1000 ems.  <BR>I know my Barry. ;P <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12348.gif"
    alt="TTTruthHeavySlanted.gif"> <BR> <BR>P.S. It gets quite hard to recognize when
    it&#39;s mercilessly stretched.

  body: I&#39;ve always loved Barry Deck&#39;s type designs and work. <BR>Unfortunately
    Truth is the only Deck typeface I have  <BR>a license for. I&#39;d love to own
    one for Traitor and  <BR>especially Eunuverse, but I couldn&#39;t find a project
    yet  <BR>to justify the purchase. They&#39;re pretty conservative  <BR>around
    these parts, and the few interesting projects  <BR>from clients who might be receptive
    for this kind of  <BR>typography are of the non-paying kind. :/
