  body: "When I watched Idiocracy, I noticed a lot of the signs looked like they were
    set in free fonts.\r\n\r\nOne of my brother's friends asked me about a good place
    to get fonts. I pointed him to FontShop, and also told him about House and a couple
    of other foundries. He replied that he thought paying for fonts was \"dumb\" and
    that he'll just stick to dafont.com.\r\n\r\nMaybe the production designers of
    Idiocracy weren't too far off the mark.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. This guy considers
    himself a designer."

    of that attitude going around, unfortunately:  too many people are taking \"I
    think, therefore I am\" way too literally.  :-(\r\n\r\n(For those who haven't
    seen it, <em>Idiocracy</em> is a brilliant movie....)"
