  body: "There are a number of designers who have done what I think is similar work,
    but this is a very casual style that presumably many artists could create. I thought
    the letterforms of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jonahfonts/chit-chat/|Chit-chat]]
    from JonahFonts looked intriguingly similar (if you slant them), especially when
    looking at more fonts from his (John Nahmias's) collection. The way some letters
    are made seems like your sample, but I admit it may just be how casual lettering
    like this would be drawn by many people.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that this may
    be a custom font, since it is an easy style to create.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
