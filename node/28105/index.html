I remember trying to sell him on doing this in two conversations some time ago, so I&rsquo;m delighted to see he bit. Though there are lots of subtle differences versus Monotype Fournier, as there would have to be (including his tail on the cap Q that just isn&rsquo;t salacious enough!), nevertheless the Fournier feel and overall look are there. I do wonder, however, whether Josh considered incorporating the Tall Caps&ndash;in Monotype you had a choice of two kinds of caps, and I remember when Penguin Books used Fournier, it was always with Tall Caps, a type choice I grew up quite fascinated by&hellip;</p>

It&rsquo;s heavier for one thing, and the italics lack the character of Fournier&rsquo;s - they are tighter, have a higher x-height, and are at less of a slant. Fournier&rsquo;s italics are much of why I use it, they are so beautiful and distinctive.</p>
<p>But it does look quite complete (altho where are the fractions???), and looks solve the HUGE Fournier caps/smallcaps problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>the v and z are so gorgeous in the italic! makes me wish i had one or the other in my name! and the rest is just lovely and feels very historic, and i just wish there were swash caps for it. Fournier must have made swash caps, hadn&rsquo;t he? wasn&rsquo;t that always done in old type? but some of the ornaments are dodgy aren&rsquo;t they? i suppose the pointing hands and arrows could be quite useful but i can&rsquo;t think of a time when i&rsquo;d have a need for a serpent man or a sun suffering from indigestion.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that retail is only part of their oeuvre, which is driven by custom work for periodicals. One tends to do what is requested by clients, and use that as a barometer of what is viable, therefore I suspect that no publication has commissioned them to fill out that particular family. H&amp;FJ are no slackers in creating mega families, so they have certainly not absconded that responsibility. But in one sense it seems to me they are more interested, in their retail projects, in cutting new territory, in hybrid/niche formats such as the numbers fonts, the two-part fonts, and the graded fonts. So filling out families with the usual weights is not a priority. Perhaps, after H&amp;FJ has bought Monolino, their production staff will be able to attend to such details.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is Josh&rsquo;s thread. What do I think? I&rsquo;m impressed by the respect for the original design, and the Pi fonts are awesome! Thumbs up for the Age of Enlightenment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Well perhaps not new (being couched in history), but unusual for a digital era foundry.
Speaking of Requiem, there is the banded version with a variety of ends. Not too many fonts with that feature.
A suite of two-colour fonts? And not like the typical &ldquo;outline with fill&rdquo;. What other foundries even have one offering like that? Well, some FontFonts. So perhaps not new territory, but a consolidation.
Numbers? Again, a &ldquo;traditional sort&rdquo; kind of idea, but no other digital era foundry has, AFAIK, developed new design packages in this genre.
And while the graded Mercury family may not be, strictly speaking, retail, it was developed for the news trade in general. That (grading) is an unusual idea, continuing the Poynter fonts idea. It&rsquo;s not the same as optical size, of course.</div>
