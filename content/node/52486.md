  body: "You nailed it, Renko. Thanks. I had scrolled through all the fonts in the
    'handwriting', 'script', and 'calligraphic' categories at Myfonts, fonts.com,
    Linotype, besides methodically combing through books, and come up blank though
    I hadn't yet tried indie websites. Love the lowercase 'n'.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    the sample was the title of a video on You Tube- dog bounding exuberantly through
    deep snow in Colorado.\r\n\r\nAnother addendum: Just discovered this is a Microsoft
    house font, maybe new for Vista- I have Macs and wasn't familiar with it."
