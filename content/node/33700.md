  I'm off to Cairns for two weeks of pure nature and no internet. \r\n\r\nAny Aussies
  have some recommendations for design/art stuff I shouldn't miss in Sydney? Would
  be nice to hook up for some drinks with the local Typophiles, too.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    terms of design stuff, well there's the <a href=\"http://www.mca.com.au\">Museum
    of Contemporary Art</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/dfactory/index.asp\">Powerhouse
    Museum</a>.\r\n\r\nI'll have a think about a few others...\r\n"

    at home as well? "

  body: When I was in Sydney a couple of years ago, the highlight was the aforementioned
    Powerhouse Museum, so definitely try and go. I'm afraid the other things I did
    were the more traditional touristy things -- but if you're interested in those
    kinds of things, the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taronga_Zoo>Taronga
    Zoo</a> was incredible. I've never seen such amazing animals in my life, but if
    you're going to be with nature for two weeks, you may want a bit more of human
    culture in Sydney.
