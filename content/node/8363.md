  body: I think this was hand-lettered, but there really aren&#39;t enough letters
    shown to be sure. The inconsistent baseline between the h and e is kind of unusual
    in a font although it happens. Where is it from? <BR> <BR>You could try doing
    a search at myfonts.com for &#34;handwriting&#34; and see if anything looks like
    it.

  body: Thanks for answering Patricia. It was on the ending of a movie called &#34;While
    You Were Sleeping&#34;. I was hoping it wasn&#39;t handwriting, but I think you
    are right! <BR>Debbi
