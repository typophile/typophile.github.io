  of the font \"Katrina\", and B: design a poster with it.\r\n\r\nProblem is, all
  I can find is stuff about hurricane katrina, and every font site just has the cartoony
  version.\r\n\r\nIf its actually another font, (like arial is the same as helvetica...)
  then pleaaaaase help me find out what it is. Or just the history of it, I'm dying
  here!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nAn image is attached\r\n\r\nP.S. whoever figures
  this out gets cookies. an image, at least."

  body: "Oh get a grip, Jan. Pray tell us who's been \"ripped off\". Was it ITC Korinna,
    or Koralle by Classic Font Corporation, or Corel's Korinthia (sold with Corel
    Draw 3)? Was it Korinna BT or Softmaker's (\"This is a copyrighted typeface\")
    Korinth or their Kingston in their Megafont XXL collection?\r\n\r\nLet's face
    it: [[http://www.linotype.com/de/712/itckorinnabyadobe-schriftfamilie.html?viewmode=family&id=712&name=itckorinnabyadobe|The
    Korinna font was designed by Ed Benguiat, Victor Caruso and others in the 1970s,
    \"ripping off\" hot-metal type owned by Berthold AG and dating back to 1904]]
    (follow the link and click the \xDCber/About tab). The letter shapes have been
    in the public domain for some time now. So the alleged \"rip-off\" is perfectly
    legal and should be good enough for a starving college student :-)"
