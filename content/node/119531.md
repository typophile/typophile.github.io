body: What is the real purpose of these tags as declared by themselves in the lower
  right panel of the OpenType window in Fontlab?  I can understand how they are used
  in individual features to run substitutions for certain glyphs in certain languages,
  but what is the point of them sitting there in the beginning by themselves? Apparently
  you have to declare at least one, or you will get build errors now, but should I
  declare every system that my font supports?  A fixed and certain set of them across
  all my fonts (as long as the font supports them),  or as few as possible, or what?  Should
  they be declared in the order their glyphs appear in unicode?  Order of most widely
  used?  Does the order not matter at all?

    there should be explanations specific to FontLab's documentation. I believe it
    s a free download from their web site."

  body: "I don't see \"languagesystem\" anywhere on the page you linked to.  \r\n\r\nFontlab
    5 manual had this to say:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nLanguage system\r\nIn practice, most
    or all of the features in a font will be registered under the\r\nsame set of language
    systems, and a particular feature's lookups will be\r\nidentical across the language
    systems that the feature is registered under.\r\nThe \"languagesystem\" statement
    takes advantage of this fact. It is the\r\nsimplest way to specify a language
    system in the feature file. One or more\r\nsuch statements may be present in the
    feature file at global scope (i.e.\r\noutside of the feature blocks or any other
    blocks) and before any of the\r\nfeature blocks:\r\nlanguagesystem <script tag>
    <language tag>;\r\nWhen these statements are present, then each feature that does
    not contain\r\nan explicit \"script\" or \"language\" statement will be registered
    under every\r\nlanguage system specified by the \"languagesystem\" statement(s).\r\nIf
    no \"languagesystem\" statement is present, then the implementation will\r\nbehave
    exactly as though the following statement were present at the\r\nbeginning of
    the feature file:\r\nlanguagesystem latn DFLT;\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt doesn't
    really explain why or in which order to use multiple languagesystem tags."
