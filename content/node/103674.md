    what do you want, <em>exactly</em>? TTF fonts are regular fonts -- outlines, which
    are usually filled with black. The only \"raster\" images inside are low-resolution
    optimised bitmaps. (Disregarding, for the moment, recent non-standard additions
    of PNG bitmaps.) Regular TTF fonts can be displayed by any software that support
    fonts. You will get grayscale at the discretion of the software used, its settings,
    and the size you display it at (some software automatically disables antialiasing
    at larger sizes).\r\n\r\nA raster font, on the other hand, is pretty much what
    your image shows: a single bitmap or a list of bitmaps, which need custom software
    support to display."

    sorry about the miseading title, it's supposed to read \"Need image to be converted
    into a font\". It's been a tiresome two days looking for something that can easily
    do this without being limited to a demo, requesting you pay them an absurd amount
    before you're able to save your small, free font in a usable form..."

    pixel pattern no matter what you do. Plus, it is *way* non-trivial. Basically,
    what Hrant said.
