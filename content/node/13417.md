  body: "I agree, I combed through several large specimen books, and the only time
    I found a close match to 'A' 'K' or 'W' was in Les Usherwood's designs. It's driving
    me crazy because I know I've seen the face or something damn close to it.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
