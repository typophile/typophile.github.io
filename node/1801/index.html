		<div class="commentbody">Very happy with Panther so far. The speed of the finder is  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->much improved. It's faster/smoother. (I'm on a G4/667). I'll  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->let you know what I think of FontBook after I've used for a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->while. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I didn't realize from the FontBook demo at TypeCon is  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that you can search for fonts (unlike Suitcase.) For example,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->searching for 'ding' reveals Webdings, Wingdings and Zapf  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dingbats on my system. (I'm looking forward to searching  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for light or small caps or round or inline or smallcaps.) This  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is a feature I've long wished for. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FontBook also has a &quot;Keyboard Viewer&quot; very similar to the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->old &quot;Key Caps&quot; applet where you can preview characters  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with various keystrokes. The improvement over Key Caps is  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you can select a font to preview it in. Very handy, especially  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for dingbat fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;show font file&quot; command is sweet. It locates the font  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the finder. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->_______ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, halfway through writing this I just discovered that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Suitcase 10.1.3 &quot;unexpectedly quits&quot; whenever I launch it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ouch.

		<div class="commentbody">Seems to me everything is much MUCH improved in Panther: besides Finder (on steroids) the software runs smoother, the whole system customization is a lot faster, logins/boots are lightning fast etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FontBook is right now probably not the hardcore tool to immediately replace the likes of ATM (may it rest in peace) or Suitcase. But if you have enough time to browse/compare/activate your fonts manually and you are very well aware of what is going on in your Fonts folders, it is extremely reasonable replacement to these tools.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is fast, very simple and what's the best part - Apple most likely created it to develop it into the next Suitcase or ATM. I mean this is just version one. So, let's give it some time and I bet it will become a really powerful tool. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Meanwhile I still have the problem with the Input Menu swicthing. Tried to swap my background picture for .jpg, but Panther still keeps changing my keyboard layout from Estonian back to US. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is probably a thing many users could not care less about, but do trust me - there are a lot of people using non-US keyboard&hellip; And it is a really annoying bug. Does anyone know if there's a workaround to tweak the system so, that Estonian could be the Input Menu language?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">All the Font Book features Joe talks about are available in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FontAgent Pro (minus the keycaps thing which is already <!-- raw HTML omitted -->accessible through the &quot;Character Palette&quot; in OS X's input <!-- raw HTML omitted -->menu). But FontAgent Pro (and the other third-party <!-- raw HTML omitted -->managers) have one thing Font Book is missing: auto- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->activation. For those who haven't benefited from the goodness <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of this feature, it automatically activates all the fonts in any <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Illustrator/Photoshop/Quark/InDesign document when you  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->open it. This saves a ton of time for those who have many  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clients/jobs/fonts to work juggle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Could Apple implement this in Font Book? Probably, and they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->might do it better than Extensis or Insider. But will they? I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would be surprised. It would be the single feature that would <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make those third party utilities obsolete, effectively pulling <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the plug on an entire (though admittedly smallish) sector of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OS X software.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No, I don't see anything new going into Font Book. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's an excellent manager for the majority of OS X users, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sort of thing the Mac OS should have been built with from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the beginning. But pro users will need something more, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and it would be dumb for Apple to flip off two longstanding  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->developers and supply the goods themselves. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->(pardon the poor writing. this was written too late at night. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gee, i wish i was still in the same time zone as all you kids.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

A font management program for me needs to have 3 features: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- auto-activation <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- drag-and-drop creation of subsets (as in ATM-Deluxe) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- search feature based on parts of fontnames (&quot;name contains&hellip;&quot;). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I understand FontBook won't give me that right now.

		<div class="commentbody">More from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacInTouch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Font Book limits   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William Kyngesburye <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Well, looks like Font Book is NOT font management for graphic artists. Not only  is there a limit on the number of fonts that can be activated (understandable),  but there is a limit on the number of fonts that Font Book can MANAGE.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's not just font families, but individual font styles - when I was near the  limit (I had 124 families, including Apple stuff and Classic fonts) and added  another font family, it only added a few of the styles. Deleted a family, and  I was able to add all of the incomplete family (so it's not corrupt fonts).   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, some font names are strange - a small number, the family name, two asterisks,  the style and a BIG number, ie &quot;8 BauerBodoni** Black 09033&quot;. These  names show up in any application that uses the OS X font panel for font selection.  Apps that use internal font handling (Illustrator) show expected font names, no  matter what Font Book says.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There seems to be random problems adding fonts as well - sometimes it won't.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can't install and manage duplicate fonts, such as different versions (some  clients are picky about versions). Probably has something to do with the PS font  file names - while you can keep different suitcase names, PS file names are fixed,  so you can't have two copies of the PS files in the font folder. No sub folder  organization to work around this, unless you manually copy fonts to the fonts  folder.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back to SuitCase.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Adam Yellin <!-- raw HTML omitted --> I tried using the Font Book instead of Suitcase and my fonts all came out jumbled,  so went back to using Suitcase for now. There is nowhere I can find that even  tells us how to use Font Book properly. Like how to remove fonts from it without  deleting them from the drive entirely.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are these reports useful here? If it's just clutter, let me know &amp; I'll stop.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, I did a 'dirty' install on my pre-Quicksilver G4 (dual 450s). I was running a shoddy upgrade of 9.2 (from 9.1.2) and had non-critical problems all over. I was too eager to upgrade Friday night, so I just ran the Panther installer right over top of the old OS. It works flawlessly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had a problem once when it woke up stupid (after being asleep all night) and I lost fast user switching until I restarted, but that's been it. Everything came over fine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, I'd like to add that I don't have a font manager (besides Font Book) yet, so I can't comment on how that goes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm very happy with Panther thus far. I work primarily with classic apps and they all work well (of course QX 4.1 still has redraw issues, like Jaguar). I have Jaguar on a much faster machine at work (quicksilver G4, dual 867s), and it runs comparably.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've upgraded to panther and I have had some serious font issues. All was well. Was using suitcase in Panther and I had no problems. Then I remembered one of the reasons I had upgraded. Fontbook! Tried it out. Thought it was nice, but I still prefered Suitcase. Then later, I wanted to play some more in Fontbook but forgot to quit Suitcase. That is when all hell broke loose.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm still not certain what happened, but it seems that any of the fonts that I had in Fontbook became corrupted and Suitcase (and even Font Agent Pro) would balk at even the idea of using or adding them again into those apps. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Luckily, after wipping my system clean to figure this out, I just pulled the fonts that were damaged from some duplicates off a fireewire drive that I have and all seems to be working in the land of Panther. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just thought I'd warn everyone to be VERY carefull about having Fontbook open with other font management apps.</div>
