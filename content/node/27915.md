  from <em>The Onion</em> would be amusing to Typophile readers.\r\n\r\nI have to
  say that, while it's kind of funny, the piece misses the mark in several respects.
  While Times New Roman is overused and plain, I don't think many find it as offensive
  as, say, Comic Sans MS, ITC Garamond, or Helvetica. Also, the selection of \"Cheltanham\"
  [sic] as the font of choice seems wrong, unless you're a stuffy Easterner who reads
  nothing but <em>The New York Times</em>. :-)\r\n\r\ns'marks\r\n"

  body: 'The Onion has been including "Type Humor" in their satire for some years
    now; the "Fonty awards", etc. They seem to have a bemused attitude about fonts
    in general, so don''t expect them to get the details right. I missed an opportunity
    last year to meet Onion writers at a cocktail party. I always wish I had gone
    there and pestered them with a lot of unsolicited detail about fonts and terminology.
    But then they might have simply concocted a story about a disgruntled typographer
    mowing down a roomful of Helvetica users anyway. '

  body: "Anyway, ITC Garamond isn't as bad as it's made out to be. The condensed weight
    is actually kind of cool (Apple's old signature font was derived from it). I predict
    it will make a comeback in the next few years, as people start to yearn for 80s
    typography again. The fact that people are ripping at it right now is a sure sign
    of this. And yes I use it from time to time. I think it goes down well with people
    who remember the 80s fondly - nostalgia potential. \r\n\r\nAnd Helvetica is great.
    Such versatily and such cool urbane elegance. I especially like the bold and the
    ultra light weights, but they're all great.\r\n\r\nComic Sans is, of course, an
    abomination. I like Cheltenham, I think it's cosy."

    did you miss the great <a/href=\"http://www.designobserver.com/archives/000205.html\">ITC
    Garamond hatefest</a> at www.designobserver.com? Recommended reading if you are
    unaware of it ; )\r\n\r\nI feel about ITC Garamond the way George feels about
    Times New Roman, although Si is totally correct \u2013 both the good and the bad
    typefaces are much, much longer lived than we are. \r\n\r\nClearly you are just
    fishing around for impassioned responses by making such provocative statements
    \u2013 nostalgia is for the weak-minded, and the prospect of an ITC Garamond revival
    is frankly pathetic. I remember parts of the '80s fondly enough, but that awful
    ITC style had <strong>nothing</strong> to do with it\u2026"
