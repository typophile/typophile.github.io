body: Hi everybody - I am new here! <BR> <BR>In fact I searching for serif font. Its
  for a magazine redesign and for long text. Should be modern but still a bit conservative,
  quiet/clean, well readable ... I think I would fancy the whiteman/Kent Lew font
  ... <BR> <BR>Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>And than I would like to show you a logo
  I did a few years ago. Its a typologo for a media solutions company. <BR> <BR>What
  do you think? <BR> <BR>Cu beck<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33130.gif"
