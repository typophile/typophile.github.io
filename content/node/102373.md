body: Since the beginning of time, ie Garamond, Bembo, Caslon and all the old style
  serif typefaces. The ascenders, on for example, the "h", "d" "b" rise above the
  caps height on all the capital letters. However, for Futura, Gill Sans and Helvetica,
  this is not the case. Why did Futura, Gill Sans and Helvetica opt for a different
  style and how does the extended ascender affect readability?

  body: I think it will be helpful to properly understand the origins of the tall
    ascenders in many typefaces. It is not that the ascenders are made tall relative
    to the cap height, but that the cap height and ascender height are independently
    determined relative to the x-height. This means that virtually any relationship
    of cap to ascender height is possible so long as each, independently, looks good
    relative to the x-height. The tendency in the humanist manuscript hands on which
    the first roman and italic types were based was that extenders tended to be quite
    long relative to the x-height, while caps tended not to be overly large, presumably
    so as not to dominate the page. These proportions were translated into type, and
    persisted in serif book hands for a long time. In 18th Century England this begins
    to change, and Caslon's and Baskerville's caps are larger relative to the x-height,
    and hence the difference between the caps and the ascenders is less.

  body: "Don't know if this will help, but an essay by Martin Majoor might be interesting
    for you:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/articles/my_type_design_philosophy\r\n\r\nNote
    that the first (modern) sans was envisioned as a display face, where the relationships
    of the ascenders and descenders to the caps usually fill a different role.\r\n\r\nThe
    shortening of ascenders has another modern component. Revivals of classical faces
    such as Bembo (and even Baskerville), first in photocomp, then PostScript, used
    shorter ascenders. Whether this was a stylistic decision or simply made considering
    the marketing of fonts for uses other than book composition, I do not know. It
    would have been great fun to have been a fly on the wall where those decisions
    were made -- which likely wasn't the drawing room.\r\n\r\nAlso, remember that
    with photocomp > PostScript, the size of the metal font used for the one-master-for-all
    sizes was a consideration. I believe the 8-point master was selected for Bembo,
    at least as offered by Linotype for their L-202 typesetting machine. \r\n\r\nThe
    smaller masters usually had a design where the character contrast worked better
    with offset printing from photographic repro,  as opposed to repro pulled from
    metal type on a proofing press. But the smaller masters also usually had a larger
    x-height, which is essentially equivalent to shorter ascenders.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIf
    you follow the Majoor essay on down, note his reasons for drawing Seria, which
    he considered a classically proportioned font, better for bookwork. For whatever
    reason, Seria hasn't caught on -- at least in the States -- which I find a bit
    sad.\r\n\r\nJohn,  or others, may know more more details, these remarks are essentially
    only my observations, and I offer them based on how I think marketing decisions
    for the sale of fonts have affected the extender lengths, and also by the increased
    use of type for signage and advertising. I'd add that at our shop -- bookwork
    only -- and where the license permits, we go into the fonts and restore the ascender/descender
    proportions of the 10-12 point metal fonts.\r\n\r\nFWIW\r\n"

    \u2026 my Linotype catalogue from 1984 shows a rather skinny Bembo. Apart from
    the ascenders and descenders being rather short, it does not look like an 8 point
    design at all. The Monophoto / PostScript version has also always been rather
    skinny (as is Jan van Krimpen\u2019s Spectrum for Monophoto / PostScript). Recently,
    Bembo book has been re-introduced. Apparently that design was based upon a master
    for smaller sizes. The ascenders and descenders are somewhat longer that the roman,
    so having Bembo book for text and Bembo roman for display sizes makes Bembo roman
    look rather funny. As if in its underpants \u2026\r\nI\u2019d highly recommend
    to read Tim Ahrens\u2019 fantastic [[http://markbattypublisher.com/books/typography-monographs-volume-2-size-specific-adjustments-to-type-designs-an-investigation-of-the-principles-guiding-the-design-of-optical-sizes/|book
    on optical scaling]] for an overview on what has been done for smaller sizes (both
    historically and recently).\r\n\r\nMore recently, Monotype released quite a promising
    range of [[http://www.fonts.com/search/all-fonts?searchtext=etext#product_top|eText]]
    typefaces. As far as I can judge from the screen, they would also serve as a \u2018caption\u2019
    size, as Adobe and others call it. They are primarily marketed as Web or e-Reading
    fonts,  available as Webfonts only though, but I suppose that many of these fonts
    would also do better in small print than their regular companions."

    only that -- that in the times of the Linotype 202, 505, & maybe the earlier V-I-P,
    the various font offerings differed. Perhaps what was used/offered even varied
    by country. \r\n\r\nI distinctly remember having to check master sizes -- for
    example, a designer friend of mine was briefly taken with Vendome, and wanted
    to use it for a text. The only \"Vendome\" available for the L-202 was based on
    an 18-point master -- at least, in the States. We tried it, once.\r\n\r\nThe Bembo
    we had for the L-202 was listed in the catalog, as an 8-point master. It was \"skinny\"
    not in width, but in weight. Sometimes Linotype offered choice of master sizes
    for a font, but these were usually between a size clearly for text, and a size
    clearly for display. Don't remember, but Bembo may have been an exception, with
    an 8, 12, and 18 point master size available. If so, the other masters were even
    thinner in weight.\r\n\r\nFor anyone studying the the proportions of type, esp.
    as they occur with metal and hot-metal revivals in photocomp & PostScript, best
    to go and check the old specimens & catalogs.\r\n\r\nLooping this back to the
    question of the thread, in the Linotype hot metal days, you could order long descenders
    for some fonts. As best I remember, this was always where the hot metal was itself
    a revival of an earlier foundry font. Odd in a way, because the ascender size
    wouldn't change. Whether this was a matter of commerce or aesthetics, I don't
    know. Probably a bit of both.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Some things:\r\n- As has been said the main reason to make the ascenders
    and caps match or not is whether you're shooting for a display or text font, respectively.
    This is because when people are consciously looking at something they generally
    like things to line up, but for immersive reading that makes the caps jump out.\r\n-
    Sans fonts are generally more for display than text, so they make the heights
    match more often.\r\n- The larger the x-height, the more reason for them to match.\r\n-
    If they're coming close enough, just make them snap; somebody could be using your
    text font for display (you're not there to stop him) and the slight difference
    will look like you messed up.\r\n- You can of course make the caps narrower (but
    not much lighter) to compensate for too much height. But be careful not to make
    them look like lc.\r\n- For writing systems you don't have nativity in, check
    with a native concerning acceptable proportions. In Armenian for example caps
    can look narrower than in Latin without being freaky (although I myself prefer
    them low and wide nonetheless).\r\n- Sometimes caps are made unusually large because
    the designer wants the font to be more usable for scanning/searching a document
    (as opposed to reading it fluidly) since proper names stand out more. Think of
    a history reference book.\r\n- Sometimes caps are made unusually large because
    you want all-caps setting to stand out more. There are some fonts where the caps
    are also/alternatively made unusually dark. Credit where due: I learned this last
    bit from David Berlow on Typophile, a while back (but I can't find the thread).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    metal Linotype, the vertical location of the baseline within the em was standardized
    and absolutely fixed for each nominal size. A standardized alignment was a practical
    necessity to enable matrix mixing inline. I believe that Linotype\u2019s alignment
    closely followed ATF\u2019s \u201CAmerican Standard Lining\u201D alignment from
    the turn of the 20th century \u2014 it was a widely adopted standard. But that

    Standard Lining \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still intact or discoverable.)\r\n\r\nLater,
    to accommodate evolving tastes and desires (primarily concerning book work), provisions
    were made to outfit some Linotype faces with longer descenders. Note that for
    these fonts, the baseline alignment remains fixed by the standard and these descenders
    actually protrude beyond the nominal em \u2014 and so these fonts *must* be cast
    on slugs with at least 1 pt leading.\r\n\r\nCharles \u2014 The provision of long
    descenders as an option was not tied to the existence of an old foundry exemplar.
    Many designs original to Linotype were outfitted with both short and long descenders
    \u2014 Electra, Caledonia, Fairfield, Eldorado, Primer, probably others. \r\n\r\nWith
    certain faces, the long descenders were considered the defaults and the \u201Cavailable-upon-request\u201D
    option was for short descenders in order to allow the font to be set solid."
