body: "I have several questions so bear with me. I have been trawling through the
  build forum looking for advice on this subject before posting and confess I have
  a very limited understanding of the subject. I am working on my first font, it's
  PostScript. I don't feel very confident about proofing what I am drawing, or regarding
  what I see on screen. I am mainly concerned with how the font prints, though I need
  a fair screen image to ensure this.\r\n\r\n1) Does hinting affect printing?\r\n\r\n(So
  far my understanding is 'yes' though I don't understand how much).\r\n\r\n2) http://typophile.com/node/27444\r\n\r\nIn
  Nick's example he mentions defining standard stems and alignment zones, so this
  will be the first thing I do.\r\n\r\n3) How is the type rendered in the preview
  window in FontLab? How trustworthy is this representation? Is this FreeType? What
  is happening when I quick test as Type1?\r\n\r\n4) If I export a font before applying
  any hinting is it up to the engines of individual programs to cope with rendering
  the type on screen? What informs the printout from this scenario?\r\n\r\n5) What
  are the essentials for a reasonable laser proof? Exporting fonts/printing direct
  from FontLab, PostScript/emulated etc.\r\n\r\nAs you can see I am very confused.
  I hope someone can take the time to talk me through this, I have spent a fair bit
  of time reading around but no sooner than I think I have a firm grasp of the subject
  it somehow slips away. I notice that a lot of threads on this topic go cold fairly
  quickly, hopefully some typowiki can be gleaned from this one.\r\n\r\nMany, many
  thanks"

  body: "1) As far as I know, hinting does not affect printing in any way. It is purely
    data that is (or is not) used by rasterizers for screen display.\r\n\r\n2) Setting
    up alignment zones (the blue bits) is always a good idea. Both for hinting and
    optical alignment of rounds and squares.\r\n\r\n3) I don't know what renderer
    is used in the preview window of FontLab, but I think it is accurate. Adam Twardoch
    can probably comment on this one best.\r\n\r\n4) I suspect the rasterizer of the
    individual progams will have to cope with the rendering. It shouldn't have an
    effect on printing it, though.\r\n\r\n5) Personally, I prefer exporting and setting
    proofs in InDesign, instead of directly printing from FontLab. Purely for convenience's
    sake, though. I don't know what kind of differences there are technically.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 1) Yes, hinting does affect printing, most noticeably at very low resolutions
    like 300dpi. Since most printers today have higher than 600dpi resolution, the
    effects of hinting are not so noticeable, but they are still there.

  body: "1) Does hinting affect printing?\r\nHinting is not \"kind of output\" specific
    \u2014 it is resolution and typeface design specific. If one composes type at
    72 pt on a 96 dot per inch screen (96 pixels per vertical em), pending typeface
    design issues, hinting does not effect the type. If one composes 10 pt for a 144
    dpi printer, (20 pixels per vertical em), hinting likely is needed to save the
    type regardless of typeface design issues. Typeface design for less hinting means
    making fonts more regular in every imaginable way, (until one reaches Chicago;)
    And for more hinting, typeface design should travel towards Snell Roundhand or
    Augsburger Initials.\r\n\r\n3) How is the type rendered in the preview window
    in FontLab? \r\nAdam, Yuri? How is T1 rendered? How is TT rendered, please? Obviously
    from above, the larger one renders type in FL, the more accurate, the smaller
    one renders type in FL, the less accurate. And, the less regular the design, the
    larger one renders type in FL, the more accurate, the smaller one renders type
    in FL, the less accurate. Then, depending on how faithful FL is to the OS rendering
    of your choice, you have an answer.\r\n\r\n4) If I export a font before applying
    any hinting is it up to the engines of individual programs to cope with rendering
    the type on screen? \r\nAll screen rendering depends first on the outlines, and
    then on hints if they are present. The outlines are either scaled and rendered,
    or scaled/hinted and rendered. Scaling in this context means shrinking from, e.g.
    a 1000 unit em to a 25 unit em to transform the outline (1000) to the bitmap (
    6 pt 300 dpi). In this scaling, each and every contour point in the outline must
    find a coordinate in the new space. So, again, the more regular the type is on
    the em, the more regular it'll stay when it is scaled to a lower resolution em.
    Hints are nice if you want irregular type to remain irregular. \r\n\r\nThen, when
    you project this out into OS and application space, all hell breaks loose unless
    the OS native to the font format handles it, in which case some hell breaks loose
    because, though the outlines may be regular or irregular, the hints are treated
    irregularly if used at all.\r\n\r\n5) What are the essentials for a reasonable
    laser proof? Exporting fonts/printing direct from FontLab, PostScript/emulated
    etc.\r\nIt's best to generate the final format you intend to supply and use it
    on the OS(s) and in the expected application(s) for output from the devices where
    you expect people to use it. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Most of the original questions have already been answered, but I have a few
    things to add. \r\n\r\nFirst, not only does hinting affect printing, but bad hinting
    can deform letters when printing to a laser printer. Run the AFDKO autohinter
    before doing your test prints and the prints will look a hell of a lot better.
    \r\n\r\nI have also found that using Fontlab to generate proofs only works down
    to nine or ten points. Below that the shapes get mangled, so test small sizes
    from Indesign."

  body: "<em>3) How is the type rendered in the preview window in FontLab?</em>\r\n\r\nDepends
    on which platform you use ... If I remember correctly, on Windows FL uses an (the?)
    Adobe rasterizer for PostScript Outline hinting preview (you can choose between
    Black/White and Greyscale), and for TrueType outlines the Windows rasterizer in
    Black/White, Greyscale or ClearType mode.\r\n\r\nOn Mac OS X it's different, obviously
    the Microsoft rasterizer can't be used, and that's why the TT preview on Mac is
    so bad ;)\r\n\r\n<em>How trustworthy is this representation?</em>\r\n\r\nAs trustworthy
    as you're certain about which rasterizer will be used for displaying your fonts
    finally. In the end reliable hinting comes down to educated guessing and experience,
    I suppose:)"

  body: "\"What do you mean by regular on the em?\"\r\n\r\nFonts for print usually
    have slight variations in otherwise common values, like alignments and stem thicknesses,
    to create the optical effects one sees in print as correct. These slight variations
    however, introduce rounding 'errors' at lower resolutions and one sees these on
    screens as incorrect. \r\nOne prominent example is the O overshoot vs. H, which,
    if you look closely on your screen at this font, does not exist, though O overshoot
    does exist in the outlines of the font you are using. Within the overshoots, the
    O,C,J,G,S,Q &,& \xD8 may all have slightly different alignments and weights of
    the baseline round hairline(s) for print due to variety in shape and proximity
    of features, width of character, and contrast of baseline hairline, to create
    the optical effects one sees in print as correct. \r\nA more regular design might
    have one common overshoot, or in a squarer design, none and thus be even more
    regular on the em. And, the hairlines can be simplified down to a couple of values
    or even a single value, all to create the optical effects one sees on the screen
    as correct. \r\n\r\nHope that helps some. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
