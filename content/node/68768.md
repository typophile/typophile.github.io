  body: "This is a tough one because it is set in all caps. I am fairly confident
    that it is Trade Gothic Bold extended. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/blair-itc/\r\n\r\nThe
    main giveaway is that the middle bar of the *E* is just barely shorter than the
    top and bottom bar. If it were Gotham the middle bar would be the exact same length.
    If it were Sackers Gothic, Engravers Gothic, or ITC Blair the middle bar would
    be much shorter. Trade Gothic Bold extended looks like a dead match to me. Thanks
    to both Renko and riccardO for contributing some good options."
