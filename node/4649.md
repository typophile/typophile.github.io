  body: You&#39;ve got some nice illustrations there, Nathan. <BR>Im digging the flowers
    most. <BR> <BR>I am finding the position of Bellus really uncomfortable notched
    under the floral design.  <BR>With such a complex mark, the placement of Bellus
    seems an afterthought.  <BR> <BR>I see a pound sign and a couple of d&#39;s in
    the intersecting stems. Do you have a variation  <BR>with a B in it? My eyes do
    most of their travel in the winding lines. <BR> <BR>In the sihlouetted design,
    I dislike the long flowered strand. You have some odd angles in there. Also, I
    dont think you need it. You could attach the flower instead to a lengthened version
    of the curve under her chin.  <BR> <BR>Bellus is very small also. Bring it up
    a bit. <BR> <BR>Andrew

  body: I prefer the floral design also. I think the &#34;d&#34;s and the &#34;#&#34;
    that Andrew sees is a result of the intersecting curves being too alike. Art Nouveau
    is very free flowing, which you are beginning to capture, but I think you can
    push it a little more. The type is clean and is trying to portray sophistication
    &#40;fine dining&#41;, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s working well with the illustration.
    Bring the letterspacing in tighter and enlarge the letters. Have you looked at
    some other typefaces? <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: I like the concept of the silhouette design, but think the implementation
    of the floral motif is much better. Even with the pound sign interference pattern.
    <BR> <BR>If you created a version of the floral patterns that formed a B, it would
    work nicely for me. <BR> <BR>As for the type, I think a general guide for size
    is to match the lineweight of the character with the stroke weight you used in
    the stem of the flower. Maybe a more indulgent, Baroque face would work better,

  body: I too enjoy the floral design. But would like the floral stems simplified.
    Too much swing and dance going on. But use all the flower pieces you have. Just
    use one stem with it splitting towards the top flower, side flower and leaf. One
    leaf is adequate.  <BR> <BR>Type will come easier when illustration is evolved.
    <BR> <BR>take care

  body: The flower, and the purple, are great. I&#39;d make the thorns bigger, at
    least some of them. <BR> <BR>Is that Skia, or Solpera? Although their &#34;Greekness&#34;
    might be inappropriate, the latter does have those wonderful &#34;thorns&#34;!

  body: I like the flower &amp; thorns. I don&#39;t  <BR>like the type, it does seem
    like <BR>an unrelated afterthought. There <BR>are some books in libraries that
    <BR>have wonderful nouveau monograms <BR>that would be worth checking out. <BR>Try
    integrating the type with the  <BR>image, weave it in and out, mabe <BR>it forms
    letters, maybe it is a large <BR>capital B? Work it till it shines mate. <BR>
