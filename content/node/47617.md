  requires me to do a set of stationary sets for a state government, of which i am
  stuck right now. None of the composition works for me. and I am not sure why. Below
  would be the current name card design i am working on. i already went through a
  few sets  which my lecturer is unhappy with. Would help lots if someone could post
  a link to where i can find out more about facsimile layouts. Thanks!\r\n\r\nabout
  the design.\r\nthe design is supposed to show how the state is a state that is mountainous
  and has an abundance of mineral and fertile soil. hence the graphic and colour scheme.\r\n\r\n

  for critiques. :)"

  body: "Hi Kelvin\r\n\r\nWhat I notice is a difference in form and typography.\r\nYou
    used a serif for the name, but a very open typography (somewhat like the Avant
    Garde, can't see well what it is.)\r\nThat doesn't work for me.\r\n\r\nThere is
    a kind of romance in the colors, the lettering for the logo. But the name, phone
    etc. has a very cold dimension.\r\nPerhaps if you alter that, it becomes more
    of a unity?\r\n\r\nFurther, less is more.\r\nThe idea of mountains and letting
    it come back in the design is good, I think.\r\nAlthough the forms contrast to
    the lettering. Not bad, it gives it more attention.\r\nBut too much is too much!
    Keep it simple.\r\n\r\nI like the design upper left the best of the once you show.\r\nPerhaps
    the logo should be lifted a bit to clear from the forms. I feel it is to close.\r\n\r\nFor
    the reversed side, you might want to think of placing the phone, email etc. in
    a white letter on that brownish color?\r\n\r\nPlay with it!\r\n\r\nLast. The lettering
    of the logo.\r\n\r\nI see that Perak is close together than state. It looks a
    bit odd to me. Especialy because the 'st' of state gets a lot of attention and
    stand closer together than 'ate'. \r\nThat is strange. I would place state closer
    together.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nOverall, it has a very nice feel!\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nRaymond"

    the extra shapes around the border."

  body: "I agree with aluminum. Less is more. Keep it simple. In simplicity you will
    find the greater force. Too much will clutter and draw away the attention and
    diminish the overal experience.\r\n\r\nDid your lecturer say why he/she didn't
    like it?\r\nThat is important. I'm very interested about that. \r\n\r\nCan we
    see the simple one from your first batch? Even if it is not as elaborate as the
    one you have shown?\r\n\r\nAbout suggestions on the font.\r\nThat is in a way
    personal.\r\nFind something that will fit your overal idea.\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I always try to use as little fonts as needed.\r\nIn this case I might go for
    the same as you have used in your logo.\r\nBut remember, that is not the only
    choice.\r\nPerhaps you intended to create a contrast. If that is what you intended,
    then you did well. But I think it is too much.\r\n\r\nJust try a few.\r\nYou will
    see what works or not.\r\n\r\nBest of luck.\r\n\r\nRay"
