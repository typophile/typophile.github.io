  for intensive editorial use, whether it is in newspapers, magazines or digital media,
  Abril is a font family of two worlds. The titling weights, based on a contemporary
  revamp of classic Didone styles, display both neutrality and strong presence on
  the page, attracting the reader's attention with meassured tension in it's curves,
  good color and high contrast. It also features typographic niceties such as ornaments,
  borders, special dingbats and alternate letters and numbers that propose a broad
  palette of tools to the designer.\r\nThe text weights are more closely inspired
  by both, 19th century slab serifs and scotch roman types. They maintain consistency
  with the headline styles, and at first glance may appear to have the same shapes
  only with lower contrast. However, in reality the letter forms of Abril Text were
  engineered from scratch to achieve a color, texture and overall width that allow
  using the font comfortably in the most challenging environments for continuous reading,
  such as newspapers. This also makes it a great font family for pocketbooks and magazines.
  Abril competes, in terms of economy of space, head to head with some newspaper classics
  such as Utopia or Nimrod, but featuring a more contemporary look and feel; and unlike
  them, includes a full set of small caps with numbers and punctuation.\r\nThe four
  main text weights of Abril Text were also <strong>manually hinted</strong> which
  grants the possibility of a smooth transition from printed media to web platform.\r\nAbril
  consists of 8 text styles and 10 display styles, all of them containing the standard
  TypeTogether character set that supports over 50 languages including those from
  Central and Northern Europe.\r\n\r\nmore information: http://www.type-together.com/Abril\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abril_2b_4062.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abril_3_6172.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abril_4b_6736.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abril_5_4058.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abril_1_5252.gif]"
