  body: "No worries. I really like Bureau Grotesque. And nicely enough, it's the very
    face (and this is the very weight) that almost six years ago brought me to Typophile
    in the first place. http://typophile.com/node/7136 \r\n\r\nNice to have a chance
    to pass on what I have learned. :) "
