  as a group of organizations focused on: advancing research in technology, small
  business entrepreneurship and finally, publishing.\"\r\n\r\nthe same client as for
  the previous post - the Whitfield Publications. After I came up with the logo idea,
  it seemed so simple, that I have been in question - did I saw this somewhere else?
  Could it be unique? Does it remind any other logo to any of you?\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance."

    form out there.  You really only have to be concerned that there's nothing similar
    in Meinert's industry.\r\n\r\nThat aside, you should look at your type a bit.
    \ The main part, \"MEINERT\" needs some kerning work, mostly on the MEIN.  Also,
    \"CORPORATION\" is too small.  When you reduce the logo, it will not be readable.
    It needs a different lockup."

    or orange instead of blue. I hardly see a resemblance, but ...hey, that's why
    I asked.

    in it, but I don't think it's a big enough resemblance to warrant changing your
    logo (especially since Konica Minolta is in a different field of business).\r\n\r\n

    a more serious note, the logo makes me think of a large faceless (and perhaps
    unethical) company. Perhaps it's the way the M in the circle draws the eye up,
    which makes it feel like the logo is looking down or overshadowing me. This said,
    I think the logo concept is very good."
