		<div class="commentbody">Personally I find it a little bit too &#34;classic&#34; for my own tastes, but it certainly looks well-made, at least from that sample.  Anyway, if you could provide better sample it would be easier to spot problems. From that sample the only things I myself would suggest are: <BR>- The &#34;A&#34; is too tall. <BR>- The &#34;G&#34; needs work. <BR>- The &#34;Q&#34; needs a much braver tail. <BR>- The spacing is nice and tight. <BR>- The italics is great [for this genre of face]. <BR> <BR>BTW, it reminds me a little bit of Vendetta, and Scala Serif too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Botvide -- Can I ask you to post this sample in a different way? Can you enlarge the separate letters &#40;x2&#41;, shrink the sample setting &#40;x2&#41; and change the color to black? Just to &#34;see&#34; things a little more in the black and white. Oh and save it as a .GIF not .JPG  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I really like the angularity of the italic. <BR> <BR>Quick thoughts: <BR>• The w looks pinched from both sides on the bottom. <BR>• The i seems taller than the normal x-height. <BR>• The g seems to be falling backward. <BR>• The v seems to be leaning forward. <BR>• Perhaps the G could become more Elzevirian. <BR>• The k seems a bit tall, the x-height portion of it.  <BR> <BR>And, I agree with Hrant&#39;s remarks. Accept, of course, the classic remark. I&#39;m all about the classic.</div>

Everything has gone quite smoothly until now, but now suddenly everything I do seem to make things worse. And not being a type professional I think I need to stop and take a deep breath. And sleep. Goddammit, I haven&#39;t slept for two days because of this! Is this how you type maniacs lead your life? The last thing you think of before you fall asleep is a possible curve of a lc &#34;c&#34;? <BR> <BR>Anyhow, here is a pdf, which perhaps makes it easier to look at the font.

		<div class="commentbody">It looks like you&#39;re using overlapping letterform parts to make the letters... That makes it hard to appreciate what it will <i>eventually</i> look like. I assume at least some of the irregularity is intentional though, and that I feel is a good thing in this case. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, <BR> <BR>you&#39;re right that I have done some overlapping, but only at certain, for me, especially tricky parts, and only to get &#34;forward&#34;, so I can move ahead, see what works, what does not, get the feel of at least some kind of holistic perspective. This is only a first rough draft, nothing more, just as I pointed out in the beginning. At this stage I am more interested in what creates a flow, not the individual letters &#40;which, naturally, is the key anyway - but these I can work on from scratch as soon as I know my direction&#41;. It is not as if it is the last check before it goes to the type store. I am not interested in copying someone&#39;s work, rest assure.  <BR> <BR>And Hrant, you&#39;re also right right about the irregularities. But some seem to disturb, others looks tempting to the eye. I just can&#39;t see any system in it. But you have to start somewhere, I guess. <BR> <BR>Best  <BR>H</div>
