body: "Hello,\r\nI am working on a logo for clothing company, to be used in very varied
  sizes. This being my first type-only work, I feel frustrated about proper kerning.
  \r\nThe typeface was completely hand drawn and digitized, having distinct \"scruff\"
  and irregularities at large size and will have a smoother version for smaller sizes.
  Large spacing is also intended. I started kerning/tracking by taking the space between
  m & u as basic and contracted 'Hem' to compensate roundness. But then got lost in
  the woods. I noticed that both outermost vertical H & l look drawn inward, so 'ul'
  spacing is made larger than 'mu', and 'He' is larger than 'em'. \r\nQuestion: do
  the high vertical letters optically narrows the gap (compared to low vertical pairs),
  or it's the fault of close serifs ('ul' case), or I'm just going nuts? \r\nThen
  I came upon some kerning tutorial saying about round letters being shrunk in height
  to compensate for some illusion. I tried with e without much difference, except
  it becoming smallest overall character. \r\nSo, I welcome your opinions on these
  techniques and general suggestions about this logo. Bear in mind that I have just
  started working with type.\r\nThank you!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hemul1_3868.jpg]"
