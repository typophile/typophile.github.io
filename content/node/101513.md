body: "I've been asked to slightly tweak an existing wordmark for a flooring company
  in Indianapolis, Indiana, but the files provided are flattened (non-vector) tifs
  and jpgs. If this wordmark isn't a custom typeface, I'd rather adjust it by buying
  the typeface and re-typesetting it in Illustrator so that the client has the editable
  artwork moving forward for all usages. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kermans_5487.jpg]\r\n\r\nLook
  familiar to anyone? I tried a few type identifiers online, but none came up with
  results that matched this wordmark. I'm guessing because there were limited characters
  available for me to comment on with their widgets.\r\n\r\nIf it's useful, you can
  also view their logo in play on their current website: http://www.kermans.com\r\n\r\nThanks,
  in advance, for any help."

      designer tweaked it? \r\n\r\nKermans has used this for a number of years, though,
      and I noticed Antiqva came out just in 2011. Any idea if Antiqva was based on
      something else? That \"source\" typeface might be the version the original Kermans
      logo designer used to get that wider K and R. Thanks again."

    body: Thanks! Trajan's pretty close, too. Do you think the designer just scaled
      the K and R to be wider in the wordmark?

  body: Ugh! The good news is it's resolved. The bad news? It's definitely a *vertically
    scaled* Trajan. Just tried it out. Thanks for all the help, friends.
