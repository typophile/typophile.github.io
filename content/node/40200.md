body: "I am helping my boyfriend translate his CV into UK format, and was hoping for
  some advice as to font choice.\r\n\r\nHe's a computer engineer/programmer/game developer
  from Sweden. The jobs to which he'll be applying are at top companies in the UK
  for senior programming or development positions in the games industry. In other
  words, everything needs to look shiny.\r\n\r\nI'm not a designer myself (but happen
  to be an old acquaintance of the esteemed Mr Coles; hello Stephen!) but work as
  a project manager for an Internet marketing consultancy.. so I'm comfortable with
  the layout aspects. I just want to choose a font that's \"right\" for this sort
  of position and don't have enough expertise myself to figure that out.\r\n\r\nAny
  recommendations?\r\n\r\nI should add that he'll submit it as a PDF, with an OpenOffice
  accompaniment, so an alternate for the .odt part would be nice as well. Thanks!\r\n\r\n/e^10"

  body: "Hej Erin! You're still in the UK? Shipping the BF over?\r\n\r\nI think a
    professional, modern sans would be the best. Fortunuately, there's no shortage
    of those. Here are a few of my favorites:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/cachet/\">Cachet</a>
    - designed by a Brit and fairly popular among bright people over there\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/neo_sans/\">Neo
    Sans</a> - ditto, but more techno\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_daxline_ot/\">FF
    Daxline</a> - an ultra clean update to an old FontFont favorite\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/process/klavika_ot/\">Klavika</a>
    - Facebook's identity typeface, can't go wrong\r\n\r\nDon't know what's available
    in OpenOffice, but if someone can link me to a list, I'll give you an alt."

  body: "Tjena Stewf :)\r\n\r\nYes, still in the UK, I quite like it here. Edinburgh
    for now, but depending on the boyfriend's job offers, it may eventually be London
    or Midlands. How's SF treating you?\r\n\r\nThanks much for the recommendations;
    I quite like both Neo Sans and Klavika (I think it's the 'g's!). What size/weight
    would you recommend for best clarity?\r\n\r\nAs to font compatibility for OpenOffice,
    I think the best thing would be to link you to a list of [[http://mondaybynoon.com/2007/04/02/linux-font-equivalents-to-popular-web-typefaces/|Linux-Windows
    agreeable fonts]]."

  body: "Klavika Regular, Neo Sans. Stay between 9-11 pts.\r\n\r\nYikes. The pickings
    are sadly slim here, proving that Linux isn't really a designer's platform. I
    guess FreeSans is the best way to go, being closest to Helvetica."
