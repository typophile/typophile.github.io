  I'm trying to find out if he custom-designed this headline font or if it's available
  anywhere. I've looked through a lot of type foundries without finding it, and also
  emailed Mr. Schweizer, so far with no luck either way. If anyone knows anything,
  I'd be very happy.\r\n\r\nI suppose it\_can be classed as a 'script' font, but wasn't
  sure, decided to post here.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nK\r\n"
