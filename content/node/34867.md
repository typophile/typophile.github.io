  the Monotype gang - The Boston Red Sox professional baseball team. And as it happens
  apart from the waysgoose and Matthew Carter exhibit (which is happening right by
  the stadium) we're on our own Friday night. If you're interested in seeing the MC
  exhibit and then coming to the game let me know. I have 10 cheap seats ($14) in
  the out-field bleachers up for grabs. Drop me an Ayrton and a ball-park beer and
  you're in.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n\r\nPS. Through my numerous big-league contacts
  I did suggest that Matthew throw out the first pitch. The fact that they even considered
  the suggestion, before declining, just shows how far type design has come in the
  last fifty years.       "

    well, I just got super giddy for a minute.

    has replaced 1918 as the chant to needle the Sox.
