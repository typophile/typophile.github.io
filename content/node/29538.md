body: "  Hello friends, I've come here to talk about a very tricky subject.  Wide
  screen LCD displays.\r\n\r\n  Since I don't know all that many people with, or who
  know about current LCD displays, and the last post made here was in late 2005, I
  thought I would ask some advice from those who know a bit about the market today
  (my dell 17inch CRT excludes me from that category outright).\r\n\r\n  I want atleast
  20 inches, but would prefer 22+ (who wouldn't), I'll be gaming, doing design and
  editing video on it, and using it with both my PC and my powerbook. \r\n\r\n  I
  would prefer dual DVI and at least some form of analog in if I feel like hooking
  my xbox to it (preferably componant, but svideo could work), but this isn't a primary
  worry.  I could always buy a monitor switching box if it became a hassle too.\r\n\r\n
  \ And it would be really nice to spend less than 500, but more like 400.\r\n\r\n
  \ Based on all of this I've narrowed it down to a few displays, but I would really
  like to hear about others that meet these criteria if you guys know of any.\r\n\r\n
  \ 1st choice: Samsung SyncMaster 22\" Widescreen Flat-Panel TFT-LCD Monitor (solid
  choice, but few imputs)\r\n\r\n  2nd Choice: Gateway 22\" Widescreen Flat-Panel
  TFT-LCD HD Monitor (great inputs, but not sure about the quality)\r\n\r\n  3rd Choice:
  Dell 2007WFP Wide-Screen Black Flat Panel Monitor (I heard dells are pretty nice)\r\n\r\n
  \ Also the dell 2407WFP 24inch looks pretty amazing, but can't really be had for
  less than 650.\r\n\r\n  Anyway, I'm fine with this thread becoming a topic for monitors
  in general, but I would love to hear suggestions for this lost soul.\r\n\r\nThanks
  alot-\r\nKent."

  body: "And I have done some reading about brightness/contrast and the 24inch dell
    sounds pretty impressive with 450 cd/m\xB2 and 1000:1 contrast ratio.  But it
    seems like 1:700+ and above 250 cd/m\xB2 and you are doing ok, but I would love
    to hear thoughts on it."
