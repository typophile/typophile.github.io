  Do you read 4lli or ylli?"

    as potentially confusable, but this way\u2026 I find it quite clear too.\r\n(If
    you eliminate the baseline terminal thing on the right it will be even clearer.)"

    me paranoid if you want...\r\nStill not sure about the descender's terminal, i'll
    probably make the end smaller and the horizontal stroke a little bit thicker."

  body: "Yes, the ball terminal doesn't work yet (and looks a bit foreign, too).\r\nAlso,
    have you tried slanting the star?"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yllilogo2_5945.png]\r\nNow the ball terminal's
    width is the same of the stem's width, and i've thickened the horizontal stroke.
    I also slanted the star, something i had already done before but was uncertain
    about.\r\nI feel like the ball terminal is now a bit too small :( maybe i should
    renounce to make it modular... does it look good?"

  body: "I think the slanted star is better. \r\nBall terminal: Frankly I'm not sure
    how much it really adds. Is there a specific reason why you want it? (And yes
    it is too small now, and oddly squashed\u2026 a ball terminal might be tricky
    to integrate into such an angular/modular architecture.)\r\nBTW, why are the top
    and bottom horizontals different weights?\r\nThere are still some problems in
    the execution, but overall I think this is quite promising!"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yllilogo3_6709.png]\r\nYes the slanted
    star is better!\r\nI wanted the ball terminal to 1) compensate the weight of the
    star (but it just creates confusion) and 2) give that \"exclusive\" and elegant
    feel i was looking for: this logo is for a chauffeur agency, i wanted to give
    a hint about cars and limos (being the type modular, \"edgy\" and slanted, with
    very long ascenders and descenders) without any aggressive feel.\r\n\r\nAs you
    can see, I have modified the terminal: this way, it looks much more coherent and
    armonious.\r\nThere are two different weights because I felt like a stronger baseline
    was needed.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Ylli means star in Albanian.\r\nAnd thanks for
    your time!"

  body: "Hey, Bez!\r\n\r\nMy two cents:\r\n\r\nI would shorten the final stroke on
    the tail of the y just a hair. As it is, it forces the eye back to the left into
    the white-space too much, and makes the letter seem bottom heavy.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    you might want to move the star a tiny bit to the left sof that the visual center
    of the i aligns with the axis of the star.\r\n\r\nVery good!\r\n\r\nCiao!\r\npeter\r\n\r\nhttp://slowprint.com/

    change the star because 1) the axis of the \"i\" is aligner with the axis of the
    star and moving it to the left unfortunately doesn't look good in small sizes.\r\n\r\nThanks
