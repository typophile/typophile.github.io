  and I finally decided to jump into the pool. I think it's still to early to post
  a font design (especially since I only made the caps so far), but I can't resist
  the urge to hear some of your oppinions.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the title of the thread,
  this is my first attempt at creating letters and the design was guided mostly by
  intuition (and a book). The general, yet vague idea behind the design is creating

    curve on the top of the B, P and R seems a little off somehow. Maybe it's angling
    downward too soon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    stroke of \"W\".\r\nW contrast = 1st stroke thick 2nd thin 3 thick 4 thin again.
    As a rough explanation! \r\nTo have a changing contrast with up- and downgoing
    strokes -\r\nas you have at \"M\" \"N\" \"X\" \"Y\".\r\nCompare changing contrast
    of M with W... "
