  is a widely acclaimed type and icon designer. She designed the icons and [[bitmap
  fonts|bitmap typefaces]] and interface icons for use on the original Macintosh computers.
  In doing so, she invented a language of metaphor and iconography still in use today.
  She later designed icons and graphics for Windows 3.0 and OS/2. Some of her typefaces,
  which have become ubiquitous on the Macintosh, include [[Geneva]], [[Chicago]],
  [[Monaco]], and [[New York]]. Her contribution to the history of user interface
  design and personal computing in general cannot be overstated.\r\n\r\nSome of her
  other bitmap type designs are available from [[Atomic Media]].\r\nLink:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.kare.com\"
