  many years now (since 97) shown here with the words spelt out \"Atomic Attack\".
  I have designed a new logo which is more organic and represents two entities that
  combine together (me + wife) that form an \"A\".\r\n\r\nShould I keep the existing
  logo, or pick something new. If you see my Avatar, it's a snippet of collage/ graphics
  that will be on one side of my business card. The logo and into text will be on
  the other side.\r\n\r\nI am attached to the existing logo and hesitant of the new
  one... I am getting sleepless nights over this.\r\n\r\nWhich one do you prefer and
  why?.\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

  body: The new one really doesn't say anything to me. The original logo is a little
    hard to read but much more distinctive and interesting. What is the business?

  body: "agree re: legibility of old logo.\r\n\r\nthe new logo looks like a swirly
    poo - with legs.\r\n\r\nI'd push for an adaptation of the old ...but then, as
    has been asked ... what is the business? Not atomic weapons of mass destruction
    I hope.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

  body: "Yes its atomic weapons of...\r\n\r\nNo, it's actually graphic design, illustration
    company etc. \r\n\r\nIt's intended not to be 100% legible since it rarely is used
    without reference of the website link, name on website and business card etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Looks a lot like those ancient sigils of demons they drew in books like the
    Necronomicon and stuff.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wicca_sigil_6713.jpg]\r\nGreat
    design - you could sell it to an sorcerer (are there still any ??) and use the
    new one instead (which I think is pretty cool as well - strangely organic)\r\n"

  body: "My problem with the new design is that it seems like a 2-D picture of something
    that's 3-D - like a poo or a <a href=\"http://www.rubylane.com/ni/shops/piatik/iteml/PS11-05-04-03#pic1\">tete-a-tete
    sofa</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you can do a version of the new design that involves no highlights
    and looks elegant as just a flat color, then I think it might look better as a
    logo (even after adding in the highlight).\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"
