body: "A new imac core duo, a copy of MS Office for Mac 2004, and a freshly-bought
  mac (postscript-only) version of Underware's Dolly.\r\n\r\nI fire up Word 2004 for
  Mac, get all the updates, and proceed to type a document with Dolly. Unfortunately,
  it seems that Word doesn't want to kern Dolly Roman, kerning is basically non-existent,
  at least for this font. The italic flavour kerns a little better, but that's of
  no real comfort. Is it the font or this version of Office for Mac that is the culprit?
  \"To\", \"WA\", \"Wa\" for example, are all left unkerned. Yet, Dolly's .afm files
  have full kerning info in them. \r\n\r\nWhat gives? Anyone else experience this
  with MS Office(Word)2004?\r\n\r\n(by the way, my earlier complaint about HP printing
  quality problems has been remedied, more or less.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I did turn kerning on. I highlighted the whole document (or even just parts
    of it), and then: Format --> Font ---> Character Spacing --> Kerning for fonts
    __ points (in this case 12) and above, checkmarked. I turned it off an on repeatedly,
    and nothing. \r\n\r\n "

  body: If other fonts are kerning fine then the font is likely the culprit, and I'm
    sure underware will have heard of the problem and may be able to provide a fix.

    for typography?  :("

  body: "To be honest I don\u2019t know the history of the default, maybe performance
    related? I do realize that it\u2019s incredibly hard to change defaults without
    users complaining. But Office, to their credit are trying to break some of the
    conventions - a good blog on their work is located here\u2026 \r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/default.aspx

  body: I don't know why you mentioned the ".afm" file unless it was to note that
    the font designer created kerning pairs; neither Word nor Mac OS X uses ".afm"
    files.  If you insist on using fonts only in the old LWFN/Suitcase paired format,
    the kerning information would have to be in the suitcase's 'FOND' resource.
