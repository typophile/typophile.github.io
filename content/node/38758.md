body: "I thought this would probably be the most logical place to post this.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for typefaces, preferably sans serifs, which have (in your opinion) nice/beautiful
  numbers. I need to typeset a project which will consist mainly of large (i.e. display
  sizes) pairs of numbers on the page, supported by minimal graphics. It's basically
  going to be a typographically based infographic.\r\n\r\nSo, sans serif, oldstyle,
  lining or both, all welcome. \r\nI was thinking about numbers like Akzidenz Grotesk
  has, those have a pleasant quirky feel to them, without getting too playful. I could
  use those, but I always like to see some alternatives before I decide.  Especially
  since the numbers are going to be playing the lead role. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: For really nice quirky numerals, it's always a good idea to take a look at
    typefaces that were specifically designed with the numerals in mind, like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/bell_gothic_virtual/?sample_text=0%201%202%203%204%205%206%207%208%209&sample_size=36">Bell
    Gothic</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/bell_centennial_virtual/?sample_text=0%201%202%203%204%205%206%207%208%209&sample_size=36">Bell
    Centennial</a> which were created for telephone books. Also <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/garage_gothic/?sample_text=0%201%202%203%204%205%206%207%208%209&sample_size=36">Garage
    Gothic</a> is worth a look, as it <em>"was derived from numbered tickets given
    at city parking garages"</em>. Any typeface designed for use in really small sizes
    is bound to have nifty numerals as well, like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/doric_std_ot_virtual/?sample_text=0%201%202%203%204%205%206%207%208%209&sample_size=24">Doric</a>
    for example.

  body: As you can see, I personally feel that beautiful, restrained quirkiness in
    numerals is often found in vintage type designs, like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=grotesque+mt&x=26&y=6&sample_text=0%201%202%203%204%205%206%207%208%209&sample_size=36">Monotype

    [[Suitcase Type]]'s <a href="http://www.suitcasetype.com/page.php?lmut=en&section=font&font=katarine">Katarine</a>
    for example.

    are often quite 'rough' (like Freight Micro). I will look into that.\r\nAnd MT
    Grotesque has the quirkiness I'm looking for as well."

  body: Hehe, well it's not really FOR anything. It's going to be an infographic which
    displays the contents of a certain database (a dutch auction website). So it's
    not really limited to a certain style, because it's not specifically aimed at
    someone. It's also not for a client, but for myself and partly for school, so
    I can do anything I want when it comes to the design and the choice of the typeface.
