body: "Is it possible to have a ligature as a 'begin' replacement in a stylistic set?\r\n\r\nThe
  stylistic set replaces a standard 'r' with a cursive style. Most 'r's don't have
  a lead-in stroke, (see r_e lig in the middle) but I need a lead-in at the beginning
  of a word.\r\n\r\nThe 'r' at the beginning in the example uses the code     sub
  @punct r.ss01' by r.begin;   but the r_e ligature on the right is the one I want
  to use. I thought the code     sub @punct r.ss01 e' by r_e.begin; would work , but
  it doesn't.\r\n\r\nI hope this is clear. Any ideas? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rollergrab_4358.gif]"

  body: "In what's visible of your code, you have\r\n\r\nsub @punct r.ss02 e' by r_e.begin;\r\n\r\nYou
    need an additional apostrophe in the above if you want this to be a ligature replacement
    rule, i.e.\r\n\r\nsub @punct r.ss02' e' by r_e.begin;\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want
    this to occur at the beginning of all words, including those at the beginning
    of a line, you'll need something like the following:\r\n\r\nignore sub @Letters
    r.ss01' e';\r\nsub r.ss01' e' by r_e.begin;\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    was the missing apostrophe."
