body: "I'm an amateur typophile, and I was hoping to get some advice.\r\n\r\nIn my
  spare time I typeset the papers for an online philosophy journal. We use Goudy Old
  Style for the text, and until now I've been using the Adobe version. I've been frustrated
  the lack of a full set of superscripts in that font, though, and so I decided to
  purchase the LTC version (with its much larger character set).\r\n\r\nNow that I've
  worked with it a bit, however, I'm very disappointed with the LTC take on Goudy
  Old Style. The spacing seems much too \"open.\" (That is, there's too much white
  space between individual letters.) The words don't hold together as they should.
  This looks clear on screen, but is even more obvious when I see it on paper. In
  short, it seems to me like a very poorly designed font. I wonder, though, if my
  reaction is skewed by the fact that I've been working with the Adobe version for
  so long. That's why I'd like some feedback from the experts here.\r\n\r\nI've attached
  the first four pages of a paper in two different versions. The first uses the Adobe
  font; the second uses the LTC font. Am I right in thinking that the LTC font is
  too widely spaced? (Look particularly at pages 3 and 4.) Or is there something obvious
  I'm missing? Is one of these more true to Goudy's original?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your comments and advice.\r\n\r\nMatty"

  body: "If you like the way that Adobe looks tighter than the LTC why can't you just
    set your tracking to be -10 or so? I mean, is it not possible to do that in the
    program you are using?\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything wrong with doing
    that, just as long as it doesn't get too close to read and then hinder the legibility
    of it.\r\n\r\nI personally like the way the LTC font appears more than the Adobe,
    and I do agree that it's spaced a little far out. That's why I just recommend
    tracking it in a bit and having to potentially kern certain letters for headlines."

  body: "Thanks for that suggestion. I'm using InDesign, and so I can certainly adjust
    the tracking as you suggest. I just want to make sure I'm not making a horrible
    mistake -- butchering a perfectly good typeface. As I said, I'm an amateur, and
    I wanted to consult more experienced hands before adopting such a radical solution.\r\n\r\nIt
    also looks like your suggestion might require quite a bit of work. The numerals,
    for instance, are set quite tightly in the Lanston font, and so I won't be able
    to adjust the tracking across the board. I suppose it wouldn't be that hard to
    format the numerals separately . . .\r\n\r\nMatty"

  body: "Your links above are broken. You\u2019ll need to reattach the sample files
    without spaces in the file names.\r\n\r\nThe spacing which would be \u201Ctrue
    to Goudy\u2019s original\u201D would vary by the size of the original \u2014 generally
    smaller sizes were spaced more openly than larger sizes. So, each of your two
    fonts could be potentially \u201Ctrue\u201D to the original, while being completely
    different, if each was referencing a different size master. \r\n\r\n(Not saying
    they were, just that \u201Ctrue\u201D is an variable target.)\r\n\r\nWithout being
    able to see your samples, it\u2019s hard to comment on specifics."

  body: "Sorry, my mistake. The links are working after all. \r\n\r\nLooking at the
    faces more closely in your examples, I can now say pretty confidently that these
    two fonts are based on different sized masters of Goudy Old Style. If I had to
    guess, I\u2019d say that the Adobe (Monotype) is based on the 12-point original,
    while I think the Lanston was based on a 10-point master.\r\n\r\nThe Lanston is
    not only spaced more loosely, it is overall a little wider in character shapes
    (as would be expected for a smaller size).\r\n\r\nSo, neither is more \u201Ctrue\u201D
    than the other. The Lanston is not necessarily a poorly designed font. It\u2019s
    just not performing the way you want (or have become accustomed to) \u2014 and
    probably was intended originally for use at smaller sizes than you\u2019re using.\r\n\r\nYou
    can try adjusting your H&J settings to compensate for the differences, but to
    some extent, it will always be different than what you\u2019re used to. It\u2019ll
    be up to you to decide whether to forge ahead and make it work in order to get
    the extra characters, or to go back.\r\n"

  body: "That's extremely helpful, Kent. I hadn't thought of that!\r\n\r\nSince the
    main text is set at 12 points, I think I'll continue to use the Monotype version.
    That said, I might use the Lanston fonts for the superscripts. I'll check to see
    how well they sit next to one another.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your input!\r\n\r\nMatty"

    3, it looks to me like the spacing + kerning of the Adobe version is more even.
    It may be unevenness rather than overall looseness or tightness that is bothering
    you. '

  body: "I'm coming to this a bit late, but it's an interesting comparison. For what
    it's worth, the Lanston version seems much easier to read. But then, the Adobe
    version of Goudy Old Style shares the problem of so many text faces that originated
    in metal and got adapted first to phototype and then to digital: they end up looking
    thin and spindly, not at all the way they would have appeared in print when they
    were set in metal and printed by letterpress. Goudy himself liked tight fitting
    \u2013 too tight, I think \u2013 but the letters he was fitting weren't as light
    and airy as these digital versions. In general, the lighter the weight of the
    typeface, the more room it needs between letters, to be comfortably readable.\r\n"
