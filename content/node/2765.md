    I&#39;ve read that CS does support footnotes similar to the way Word does...

  body: Thanks for the reply HD - but its CS I&#39;m using. <BR>ID is new to me, so
    I may well be looking in the wrong place. <BR> <BR>End notes aren&#39;t an option
    - the content dictates that it has to be footnotes.

  body: OK, so if In Design can&#39;t do footnotes, then is there some other software
    I should be using, or does anyone have any advice about how to go about this manually.
    <BR> <BR>I have around 110,000 words, with 850 or so footnotes. The footnotes
    vary from 2 to 250 words.

  body: Oh boy... Ventura was able to do this, but that isn&#39;t an option. The last
    job like this I did -- years ago, mind -- I did in Word. If it is just text and
    a bit of visuals... it&#39;s not all that bad, actually. :-D.  <BR> <BR>You could
    try Sonar Bookends...  <BR><a href="http://www.virginiasystems.com/" target="_blank">http://www.virginiasystems.com/</a>
    <BR> <BR>AdobeFramemaker does support footnotes, but welcome to HELL if you try
    working with that as a designer...

    personal thing, rather than a work thing, so I think the $195 for InFnote might
    be pushing it a bit. &#40;I just need to find a work project with loads of footnotes

    when I get to work as we have a proper connection there, and I&#39;m still on
    56k at home&#42;. <BR>I guess that&#39;s a different one to the one on the CD,
    which is 9mb. <BR> <BR>&#42;Don&#39;t know if this will mean much to anyone outside
    ofthe UK, but today is Hooray day for us as we have finally hit BT&#39;s ludicrous
    trigger level for broadband. Now we just have to wait a month or so to see when
    they&#39;re going to activate our exchange - some that already have activation
    dates will be waiting till september.  <BR>Well, thank Maggie we don&#39;t have
    to put up with a slow , innefficient, expensive owned-by-the-people telephone
    system anymore.

  body: 'HD Schelnack said : Endnotes &#40;which is nicer, imo, anyway <BR> <BR>Ouh
    i don&#39;t think so. How unconfortable is it, when you read a book, to keep the
    endnotes pages marked in any way, and to be obligated going to theses pages when
    you could simply look in the back of the page you read. It&#39;s kind of a torture.'

  body: I certainly prefer footnotes if I&#39;m the reader. <BR>I think end notes
    can be OK if they are purely academic references - all the info you need when
    you read it is in the text, and if you need to look up a source, then you can
    check the endnotes. <BR>&#40;Its really annoying though, when all the notes are
    at the end of the book, rather than the end of each chapter, under headings like
    &#39;Notes for Chapter 6&#39;, and you have check every page from the reference
    back to the chapter start to make sure you have the correct reference&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>In this case, the footnotes include academic references, but also, sometimes,
    asides, qualifications and clarifications as well as detailed discussion of supporting
    evidence. Most of this stuff has to be footnoted in order to keep the momentum
    of the main thrust of the argument going in the text, On the other hand it shouldn&#39;t
    be hidden away, as it includes details which are essential to a more considered
    appreciation of the finer points of the argument. <BR>In this case, as well, I
    think the demands of the content over-rule any kind of typographic judgement.
    <BR>&#40;typography...over-ruled...am I allowed to say that here?&#41;

  body: Yves Perrousseaux even counsels to put the notes the nearer of the text possible,
    like in the margin with that middle age style he likes, and i think it&#39;s not
    a bad idea. It might be very aesthetical if well done.

  body: I find footnotes best if they are short and serve to directly elucidate some
    statement in the text. I find footnotes best if they are longer and involve a
    tangential discussion, e.g. a summary of conflicting opinion on a subject, or
    of prior scholarship. It is possible to conceive of a text that would have both
    footnotes and endnotes.
