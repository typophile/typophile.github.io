  body: Find My Font says it is Avenir Next LT Pro Bold or Avenir Black Bold (Adobe).
    Both look very close if not right on.

  body: "Agree Bojev, Avenir looks pretty close but for the letters only. Numerals
    are clearly not matching. /2 and /3 looks closer to some Akzidenz Grotesk and
    /(1)965 to Futura...\r\n\r\nEDIT: agree now with Jan on numerals"

  body: Apart from the numerals (and some details) being off Adrian Frutiger designed
    Avenir in 1988. So, the sample would have to be from Back to the Future.

  body: As close as I can get on figures is Bernhard Gothic Bold (BQ) but it is not
    perfect either. 6 and 9 are too tall and 1 has slant to it.
