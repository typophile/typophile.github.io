body: Hello Typoguru&#39;s... <BR>A client has asked me to ID two fonts from GQ magazine
  &#40;UK&#41;. I picked them as Glypha light and Fenice ultra - but they&#39;re both
  not quite right. Can anyone here with better eyes and more knowledge of the UK mag
  scene pick these two...? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16866.gif"

    <a href="http://www.daltonmaag.com/fonts/exclusives/lexia.html" target="_blank">
    Lexia</a>, and the modern face is  <BR>a display version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-fenice/ultra/testdrive.html?s=icon%20adam%20faith&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> ITC Fenice Ultra</a> by Aldo  <BR>Novarese &#40;well spotted
    Paul!&#41;. <BR> <BR>GQ Magazine being one of the big ones, it is not  <BR>unthinkable
    that they use customized versions of  <BR>these typefaces.
