  wordmark for an apparel shop. Their consumers are mostly men. However they also
  sell women clothing. I presented some sketches and they liked them but they thought
  they were manly, so I was asked to make it more womanly. I can't figure out what
  they meant typographically thinking. \r\n\r\nWhat would you consider makes a typography
  in this vein more feminine?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PUERTO33-3_4550.jpg]"

  body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nthat\u2019s a very nice looking wordmark. Looks quite good so
    far, but indeed very \u2018manly\u2019. The flat top 3 looks also very masculine,
    aggressive  and strong. A thick/thin contrast would be hard to realize \u2014I
    think\u2014 why not making the wordmark a lil bit thinner at all?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFlorian"

  body: "Hi thank you for all your comments, I've been working on it. I tried to play
    with thick/thin contrast and made it a bit wider. I kind of like the results,
    though there are some thing I'm not quite happy with.\r\n\r\nI feel the \u201CT\u201D
    is not wide enough. Although I like the feel of the \u201CU\u201D and \u201CO\u201D,
    I'm not sure about the \u201CO\u201D shape. Finally, I haven't figured out the
    look of the \"33\" but I'll keep working.\r\n\r\nI'm very happy with the feedback
    provided by this community, I don't know why I hadn't signed in before. You're
    great guys.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Evernote Camera Roll 20130808

  body: "Hey moramedia,\r\n\r\nthat\u2019s looking good so far, much better than your
    initial sketch. There is a certain feel of the \u2018Prada\u2019 logo, very elegant
    but not to fancy. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion the serifs a wee bit too tiny. What about
    making them bigger, especially the serifs of the \u2018T\u2019 stem to small \u2014I
    think.\r\n\r\nApart from that, keep up the good work!"
