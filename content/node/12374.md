  wanted to know what do you think, what's wrong and what can make it better. Sorry
  gifs, aint very good quality. \r\n\r\nThanx. Saludos!"

  body: 'Some thoughts: The spacing in Fraktal is bad in all versions. The biggest
    crime is the KTA, you could drive a truck through those spaces. In #2 I don''t
    like the forced justification of the word design, its just not balanced. In #3
    why not bleed the F from the left hand side of the box and the L from the righthand
    side of the box. Also try loosing the word design all together and make it part
    of a tagline that describes the kind of design business you are creating. In #4
    The mark almost becomes an S. Number 6 is just a forced design. I think you have
    a good start keep going! '

  body: "I second the observations on the kerning problems.\r\n\r\nThe fractal mark
    (the S shape) is interesting, but visually weak. I'd recommend making it stronger/larger/bolder/more
    striking, something. It's meant to be a focus and a unique feature, but many of
    your designs come off as ways to make up for the wiry quality of the mark. However,
    all of those framing elements around it tend to detract or distract from the primary
    focus of the mark. Plus, the internal spirals clot up as they converge, which
    will be   a problem in both print and screen media. Perhaps a <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=op%20art&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&sa=N&tab=wi\">GIS
    for 'op art' will help inspire some stronger fractal-esque images</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    prefer 1 and 6. 6 for the strength of the box (but not of the fractal), and the
    balance of the type. 1 for the simplicity of the overal logo and the contrast
    between the typefaces. However, both need work and refinement (as mentioned above)."

  body: "The image reminds me of a mutated ammonite rather than the recurring shapes
    of a fractal (which as Chris mentioned will always be a compromise in print) while
    you could make an animated logo for screen use (although quite distracting), for
    print you will have to make a cutoff point which allows you to show a fractal's
    nature and allows you to print without creating a mark that contains too many,
    too close repeats. As a starting point to consider http://mumble.net/~jar/visuals/fractal.html.
    The problem you set yourself is that many will have some basic knowledge of a
    fractal's properties, I wonder if it is possible to create this feel with type
    alone?\r\nTim"

  body: it's not a fractal, but a cloned, fusioned ammonite. yes you are right :P
    . I didnt thought of those obvious printing problems. Will try to make it simple
    and give it a more fractal form, even i would like to be not very obvious, and
    i was looking to search those forms in nature, as to put together maths complexity
    reasoning organizing with beauty, sensibility we are able to found in nature for
    example

    your image, however I think the name will provoke a similar reaction to many.
    Ammonites and Nautilii, which I too find most intriguing and beautiful shapes,
    put me more in mind of Fibonacci.\r\nTim"

  body: ' no.5..I like the colour choice of blue..I would justify the two names. The
    "A" is a great font choice..don''t lose that but I would work on the proportions
    of the icon in the middle of the 6/7/(can''t remember the sides..but the unique
    black uneven side shape and make the icon in the middle lager to fill more black
    space.  I think you have all the elements..just need to experiment with more combos..post
    the updates..would like to see...good luck!'
