<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>After converting [[http://www.example.com|PF Beau Sans]] (by Parachute) to outlines in Illustrator CS3, I noticed that it's forms are made up of very many points. Especially the V looks like it could be made with a lot less.
I'm not a font designer, but isn't there a point to using as few points as possible in the design of a font?
And is this an example of using too many points, or is there a reason for doing it this way?
I'm now assuming that converting the font to outlines in illustrator will give approximatley the same points as those in the original design. Please correct me on this if I'm mistaken.

<div class=commentbody>Good to know, Dan.
Still it's kind of weird that the one side of the V has over 9 points while the other has only two. Of course a few more points are needed to get a slight decrease in the width, but not this many.</div>

Are you using a ttf font file or an open type font file?
Maybe this make the difference?

<div class=commentbody>Hi Jorg,
I’m sorry to inform you but this is a hacked ttf copy of PF Beau Sans. Let me explain to you. Shortly after our site went up a few months ago it was hacked and somehow they managed to get several of our fonts but only the ttf versions which are used specifically online for generating the samples in the font test driver section. We acted immediately and now everything is well hidden but the damage was done. I’ve had a hard time managing illegal circulation of our fonts to a minimum. Our opentype fonts which are sold online including PF Beau Sans are optimized and each one of the characters is made up of just a few nodes (postscript bezier curves). On the other hand the ttf versions being truetype contain multiple nodes (as is the case with this one) which were generated when we converted the opentype into truetype simply for online testing. No hard feelings but I would appreciate you buying the font.</div>

What? No, I have never experienced that they change in Illustrator. I did a double check and all the fonts I tested had exact point placements as they have in FontLab. The only difference is the type of nodes (Illustrator cant show the three type of nodes FontLab has).

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the reply, Panos.
I had no idea this was a hacked ttf copy of the font, as I believed it to be bought and licenced by my school. I'll make sure it's deleted, and have it properly purchased if anybody wants to use it.
For the sake of curiosity: If you (or anyone else) with the real version of the font could upload a screenshot of the curves of these letters (A and V), that would be very interesting. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Cubic_DS says:

That’s why I’m asking...
It is important to be very clear in the definition of OpenType. There are too many myths around this format: OpenType is a transparent format that can hold both CFF outlines (compacted PostScript) and TrueType outlines. If the font file is labelled OTF, either outline can be present in the font. A font labelled .TTF is as much of an OT font as a font labelled .OTF. The reason Microsoft decided to stick with .TTF is to provide backward compatibility with older systems, way back to NT4 even. Of course, OT typographic features will not work in these environments.
Again, it is very important to understand that .TTF fonts *ARE* OpenType. They work on both Mac OSX and Win.
My two pennies worth - and yes, the extra points are placed when Illustrator converts a TTF outline.

<div class=commentbody>How tremendous is this. Here we have a guy named Panos complaining about having his fonts hacked and imploring someone to buy his font when his own "Muse" is an obvious ripoff of a much nicer font called "Delicious," created by Jos Buivenga. Come on, Panos. Fess up. A few added "serifs" does not an original font make. That's pretty pathetic if you ask me, and for those who don't believe me, simply check out the pdf from parachute.gr. and compare with Delicious, which is free.</div>
