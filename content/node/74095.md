body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\ni need to make a letter template to go with the logo i
  designed, first i did the entire layout in Indesign but the company also needs editable
  word documents where the employees just have to fill in the fields.\r\n\r\nI did
  determine where everything should come like \"date, department, contact, name...etc\"\r\n\r\nWhat
  i would like to do is that the people whom open the template just have to put there
  cursor in the field and type the date, hit tab and go to the next field, so that
  every letter that is being send out of the office has the exact layout and type
  used. \r\n\r\nsomething like:\r\nDate: \"Type todays date here\"\r\nName: \"Type
  your name here\"\r\nDepartment: \"type the departments name here\"\r\n\r\nAlso whats
  the best format for a logo to be placed in word.\r\n\r\nHope you guys can help me
  out as its actually my first time i'm doing something like this, if someone could
  find the time to tell me how to do this from step one it would really be appreciated.\r\n\r\ni
  did try looking for some kind of tutorial on the net but don't quite know how these
  actions are called\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    about form fields. You'll need to create a protected header section I think.\r\n\r\nFor
    your second question about the file format for the logo, I'd suggest using a png.
    Putting jpegs in Word tends to leave artefacts when printed."

    entry</a> turned up with the exact phrase you asked here.)

  body: You can place your editable fields within a borderless table, so that entries
    don't affect the flow of the rest of the document. Word, at least v.2003 and later,
    allow placement of EPS files within the document.

  body: You can make editable forms in Acrobat. May be more flexible than Word.

  body: EPS works in Word, but sometimes looks strange on-screen. I think EMF (which
    Illustrator can create) is better - prints just as sharp and better on screen.

  body: "Yeah. Here's what to do in Word 2003. Word 2000 will probably be similar.
    Later versions will need as bit more searching for the commands :^) \r\n\r\nDraw
    a table (you will probably want to format it with no borders as Nick says) and
    populate it with form fields for the layout of the templatey bits. Bring up the
    \"Forms\" toolbar for quick access to the text-box and other form fields. After
    the table, insert a section Break (set to \"Continuous\"). Then go to \"Protect
    document...\", and from the \"Editing restrictions\" dropdown, choose \"Filling
    in forms\". Click the \"Select sections...\" option and tick Section 1 but leave
    Section 2 unchecked. Then hit the \"Yes, Start Enforcing Protection\" button.\r\n\r\nAdd
    a password if you want one.\r\n\r\nThen users should be able to type what they
    want in the botton bit (under the table), but only fill in the fields in the top
    bit.\r\n\r\nIs that what you wanted?\r\n\r\n\r\n-Oh, and as Forrest says, EPS
    works for the logo, but may look crap onscreen because it'll only show the low-res
    bitmap header. EMFs are just as good for letterhead purposes..."
