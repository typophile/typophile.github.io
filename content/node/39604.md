  body: "my wife, kids and i were watching the kansas universtity basketball game
    against arizona on sunday. the game was knotted up - a real back-and-forth, when
    i couldn't keep it in any longer. \r\n\r\n\"the letterspacing on the 'KANSAS JAYHAWKS\"
    painted on the hardwood [this is enormous, 3456 pt trajan]  is SO AWFUL...\"\r\n\r\neveryone
    stared at me with a look of incredulous disgust.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fieldhouse_4032.jpg]"

  body: "Haha on a similar note I was telling my mom how proud I was that when you
    google my name the first 2 pages are totally about me. And she asked me what a
    google was.\r\n\r\nMy partner is an art director too so we don't have too many
    conversations that don't incorporate design. I'm way more anal about kerning than
    he is though, so i get yelled at for picking apart his typesetting sometimes.
    :)"
