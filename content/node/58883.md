  \"Machine Script\" that I rather like.  The problem is that I'd prefer one with
  a more \"high quality\" aesthetic.  In short, the machine script font has very wavy
  forms and I'd prefer a typeface that resembles machine script - just with smoother
  lines and less of that wavy thing going on around each letter.  \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?
  \ I'm designing a logo and would love to use a font like machine script...I just
  can't deal with the wavy lines.  :o/  I'm not a typographer, but I'm hoping that
  I explained this in a way that was somewhat understandable.  Thanks again."
