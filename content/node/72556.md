  body: "There's a bit of confusion in the article, but the site is called whatfontis.com,
    and not what<b>the</b>fontis.com. It certainly doesn't appear to have anything
    to do with MyFonts, and I'm having trouble working out exactly who's running it.
    \r\n\r\nI've tried out two font ID's, the first match identified the correct,
    legal, font on both of them (linking to myfonts) and on both the second match
    was a free version of the commercial font in the first match, downloadable directly
    from whatfontis.com. "

  body: Yes, <a href="http://typophile.com/user/60072">Alexandru Cuibari</a>, who
    is a fellow typophile since a couple of months, is the guy behind whatfontis.com
    (and also ffonts.net). He often has linked to that site, or its alias identifyfonts.net,
    in threads on the Type ID Board.
