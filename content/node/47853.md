  The magazine is free and the content ranges from celebrityportraits, drinking habits
  and travelguides.\r\n\r\nSince our targetgroup is quite large and we have a growing
  circulation we need a typeface that as many as possible like that is easy to read,
  but still has an edge that stands out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe types we are currently
  using is Soho Heavy for titles, ITC Officina Serif for text, and Officina Sans for
  all the extras. Quotes and lead are Officina Serif italic. \r\n\r\nThe font we are
  thinking about using is FF Tisa, also featured here at the forum. Is looks good,
  especially in italic, but the specimen is really weak. The only text-sample we can
  find is four lines set in 10/12- or 8/10 pt.\r\n\r\nIs there any way we can get
  a closer look at this font? If any of you have already bought it, is it possible
  to send you a text that you could set with FF Tisa, export as a PDF and send back
  to us? We would be most greatful.\r\n\r\nWe are interested in sans-serifs that goes
  well with FF Tisa. The font used in the [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/download.php?docid=8358|specimens
  from FontShop]] looks good, does any of you know which font this is? Looks like
  a less blurry version of FF Info or something.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if any of you has
  experience or point of views with Tisa, we look forward hearing from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest
  regards\r\n\r\nmod + mod"
