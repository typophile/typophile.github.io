body: "Does anyone know this typeface and can provide a link to the font? I'm restoring
  my old wagon for my daughter and want to use the same vintage logo. I can't find
  it as a decal anywhere and may just recreate it instead of doing a traced stencil.
  But if there is a font out there I can use it will make it much easier.\r\n\r\n\"radio\"
  looks very similar to Bauhaus but there are differences especially with the \"r\"
  and \"i\" and \"flyer\" isn't anywhere close. hopefully the \"18\" is a match as
  well.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/radioFlyer_4049.jpg]"

  body: The rs are way too funky to be anything but custom, probably very loosely
