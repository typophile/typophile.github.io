    FF Info the difference between the various weights (Normal, Book, Medium, Semi-Bold
    and Bold) has been designed to compensate for this effect. For example, white
    text set in Book weight on a black background is optically the same as black text
    set in Medium on a white background. With back-lit signs dark text appears thinner,
    in which case the Semi-Bold weight would be appropriate.\u201D \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/info-display\">FontFont</a>\r\n\r\n\u201CFront

    appears on illuminated signs which are either backlit or lit from the front. These
    variants are also useful for the compensation sometimes required by white text

    a set of two fonts would count as grades, sure, see the Stone families."

    the consistent metrics across the set of fonts are a requirement for the fonts
    to qualify as grades. As such, neither the Guardian series, nor Lexicon, Ruse,
    Info, Transit or Clearview are graded sets in the traditional sense. I\u2019d
    be curious to find more. Until now [[http://kupferschrift.de/cms/2012/05/multi-axes-families/|my

  body: "Ah, you're right - it's not even close. So an interesting question results:
    can grading not be properly applied to positive versus negative setting of text?
    Maybe it can only be properly applied to combat inking variance (like at Font
    Bureau). I wonder because Montalbano (who's known to be technically quite proficient)
    probably would have liked to make Clearview's \"B\" and \"W\" cuts uniwidth, but
    maybe thought the spacing compromise was too great*; but Stone <em>does</em> regularly
    shoot for it**. And Hagmann goes all the way.\r\n\r\n* Although accommodating
    halation might have been a special factor in Clearview.\r\n\r\n** http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/halofontspage.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>the consistent metrics across the set of fonts are a requirement

    it have to be across the whole set? For example in Clearview, if there are <em>pairs</em>
    of fonts (a \"B\" and a \"W\") that are slightly different weights as well as
    being uniwidth**, each pair could be said to form a (minimal) graded system, making
    the typeface as a whole a set of graded fonts.\r\n\r\n* Although of course it's
    not a <em>sufficient</em> condition.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/100708\r\n\r\n**
    BTW, do you think \"uniwidth\" is a good term?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
