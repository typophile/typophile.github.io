body: "Hi everyone...\r\n\r\nI wanted to know which is the use of \"lookups\" in ligatures.\r\nI
  know that allows to group ligature substitutions... \r\n\r\nAlso the use of \"ignore\"
  and \"from\" instead of the \"by\". \r\n(are there other type of instructions of
  this type?)\r\n\r\nIs there any advanced manual for OpenType I can look at?\r\n\r\nThanks
  :)"
