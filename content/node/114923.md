  De Unie in Rotterdam? It was built and designed in the 20s by an architect from
  the DeStijl movement. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cafe_de_unie_2_5905.jpg]"

    Zufunkt which looks to have almost all earmarks you need for this design.\r\nOther
    option but far less close is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova|Mostra

  body: "Totally agree Don and I add pointy /N and /A and /R straight leg to the list.
    That's why I specifically talked about Dessau Zufunkt which has all these features.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_tester_generate_image_4923.png]"

  body: "Yes Ryuk, Dessau Zufunkt  is a good choice for the uppercase letters shown
    in the signage, but the lowercase is awkward. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dessau
    ZufunktInUse_4359.jpg]\r\nIt looks similar to Paul Renner's original design for
    Futura http://sietepecadosdigitales.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/004_paul_renner_theredlist.jpg
    which I consider to be an excess of geometry for the sake of geometry. But then
    again, some people like this stuff.\r\nDon\r\n"
