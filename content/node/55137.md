  printing the sample .pdf and mulling over how this type family looked on the page,
  I began to realize how well it reads. This font has to be among the most legible
  and readable I've come across. I usually don't go in for such softly-curved letterforms
  (save for Kris Sowersby's Feijoa, which I *love*), but Expo's getting to me. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.typeculture.com/foundry/font_collection/font.php?ID=FNT09_03\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts on Expo Serif? I wonder what my typographic betters think of this, so I
  can learn as well. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nChristian."
