  body: "This is funny; I'm looking for sans face I'd say falls in the same broad
    category (see earlier post \"Pre-War Sans\"), but your request is perhaps broader.\r\n\r\nMy
    list for this would probably be:\r\n\r\nUnderground Pro\r\nRelay\r\nVerlag\r\nGotham\r\nEncore
    Sans\r\nProxima Sans/Nova\r\nAvenir\r\nFutura\r\nAvant Garde\r\nFedra Sans\r\nNeue

    I'm looking for something that goes well with a modern serif face like Modern
    216..."

  body: "I think it's absolutely beautiful. Should pair nicely.\r\n\r\nReminds me
    of Freight Sans, which I also have an enduring fondness for, and which also pairs
    beautifully with contrasty serifs (like the other end of the superfamily, no doubt).\r\n\r\n...and
    Encore is something special, but I do find all the Parachute faces to be rather
    pricey, though most of them have so many international features they're quite
    justified...still, 800,00\u20AC always makes me wince a bit."
