body: "Hinglish is what happens when people mix Hindi and English while conversing
  and chatting.\r\n\r\n- Hindi words are substituted for English words in sentences\r\n-
  English words are used in Hindi sentences\r\n- Phrases are added from either language
  for emphasis\r\n- combination words are morphed, by conjugation and verbification
  of nouns\r\n\r\nThis trend has grown significantly and examples are seen in India
  in\r\n- International branding - coke, pepsi, McDonalds etc\r\n- Chatting, conversations,
  radio, TV, soaps, Movies, Coomericials, Posters...\r\n\r\nSo my experiment questions\r\n-
  If a combination can happen on a sentence and word level\r\n- is it possible to
  push the envelope at a character level\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see pictures attached and
  blog - \r\n\r\nhttp://rohiniblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/experimental-hinglish-script.html"

    least in the school where I studied. We use to write things this way as a code
    language. For the fun sake, of course!\r\n\r\nBut yes, this has not been developed
    or digitized as a typeface yet. You can indeed go ahead and do that. With Open
    type technology, it's all possible!\r\n"

    fonts with the visual style of Indic scripts have been around for a while.</a>
    I used some good free ones about ten years ago but I have no clue what the names
    w2ere. The word replacement is just OpenType substitution, there\u2019s documentation
    at Adobe.com."

  body: "James - this idea is different than what you have linked above. In the samples
    Rohini have posted, the base consonats are Latin, but the vowel signs (matras)
    are from devanagari. Here, accents (matras) has not been used just for the style
    sake - they actually change the meaning of the words, just like they do in Hindi.\r\n\r\nAnd
    in order to understand this, one must know Hindi! :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The one shortcoming I see in this kind of Hinglish is that \"aa\" matra can
    look like an [English] \"i\" at a quick glance. So, for instance, Banini instead
    of Banana (which I would have transcribed as Banaana, personally, without the
    final \"aa\").\r\n\r\nThere are other potential confusions between scripts, especially
    with handwriting -- like Mango, where your M looks a little like Devanagari \"la\"
    and your G looks a little like \"da\". I don't know if this is more or less likely
    to be a problem for someone coming more from the Hindi side. \r\n\r\nBut fun!"

    with a 1/2 mile underground track, make Chinglish, Germanji, Frencabic and Cherokeyrilic
    and drive the unicode consortium right over the cliff. :)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: Kent,  you're right there. It can't be a functional writing system as there
    will be so much of confusion. Also, not all the combinations are possible with
    this mixing - but as said, good for fun!

  body: "Hello all, thank you for your comments - \r\n\r\nSatya - I thought this was
    a fun and interesting way of writing too. I agree this idea may not be completely
    unique, but like you said as there is no digitized version typeface i think it
    would be interesting to make one and see how people use it.\r\n\r\nKent - This
    was a quick handwriting test and I ran into some trouble with inconsistency. Also
    I see your point amount the letters being confusing - I'm working on how to figure
    this out in a digital way so these errors can be fixed.\r\n\r\nsome ideas are
    - \r\n1) the Latin characters cannot touch the bar and need to be lower\r\n2)
    The 'matraas' (hindi accents) need to touch the bar\r\n3) need to figure out when
    to use the matra and when not\r\n4) If i can swap more than just matras, maybe
    eliminate English silent characters and make the script meant for completely phonetic
    use\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks Again, I look forward to more comments on the follow up
    post.\r\n\r\n"
