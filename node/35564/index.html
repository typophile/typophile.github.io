<p>So far I have a general which uses an A mark I designed that bleeds off of the right hand side of page and Gotham Rounded for most text and probably Swift or Mercury for longer text applications ( primarily for my personal statement ), and a design for a business card.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think!</p>

<p>I like the large A, but the shadow is kind of weird. The lines on the bottom don&rsquo;t seem evenly distributed, and in the middle of the A, the lines don&rsquo;t match the angle of the cutoff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the squiggly line. What&rsquo;s the reasoning behind it? Watch where it intersects with your name&ndash;it causes visual tension with some letters.</p>
<p>I think you can take your contact info down a few point sizes. Right now your name doesn&rsquo;t stand out because it is the same size as the contact info.</p>
<p>You might want to make P and E italic as well, in order to help them not blend with the info that follows.</p>

I might experiment with different widths between the hash lines on the A shadow. Right now the gaps between the white lines are almost equal to the line widths themselves and it&rsquo;s creating an odd vibration. But maybe that&rsquo;s intended.</p>
<p>(there&rsquo;s the gap width between the black A and the white outlines, and the gap width between the white hash marks, and the width of the white lines&hellip; and they&rsquo;re all very close, but not identical)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the A, but the stroke on the right hand side is a bit too thick, creating a bit of awkwardness. Maybe you might want to try to space out the A a little more, maybe from the top margin? Personally, I&rsquo;d prefer a heavier weight as opposed to italicizing your name. I like both colors; very bold and strong. Gotham is such a pretty font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like the white card&hellip;maybe try swapping the black and red so that the A is the highlighted element in red. At the same time, maybe knock the shadow/3-D back to a 50% black tint.</p>
<p>I agree that the dashed line just seems extraneous. I&rsquo;d skip that.</p>
<p>The only other suggestion is that the A seems a bit in limbo stylistically. Is it meant to be a reminiscent of antique type? If so, maybe go with a more rustic aesthetic like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.archivetype.com/content/view/40/30/">http://www.archivetype.com/content/view/40/30/</a></p>
<p>Otherwise, if it&rsquo;s meant to feel more linear and modern, perhaps push it a bit farther in that direction.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer the white card. Also not a fan of the dashed scribbly line. One thing to note is that the white counter line formed between the &lsquo;A&rsquo; and the red lines is uneven. Possibly you were trying to create some dimension even with this, but I feel it should remain constant, because it is so close to appearing as if it is one thickness.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you guys for your comments. I&rsquo;ve been looking at that A for the last hour or so and I&rsquo;m also starting to see that it&rsquo;s just not so.
Because the overall identity was supposed to be very simple and clean I was depending on that A to be just right so that I could differentiate myself without looking out of place.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be unique but not overly ornate that it felt out of place against a solid or white background with Gotham Rounded, bt right now it sort of looks like a mess. Im going to work on this tonight after to work!</p>
<p>For now I have posted a very early concept sketch of the whole thing. (Where Are You Going/Where Have You Been was what I wanted to use for the theme of my portfolio and personal statement when I was first planning things out)</p>
