body: "I was sent a sample from an old book from the Thirties that turned out to be
  Middleton's Tempo Medium Italic from about 1930. It's a sans typeface (shown in
  the Jaspert Encyclopaedia of Type Faces), but it has baseline serifs on a number
  of letters (a, d, h, i, l, m, n and t) only for this weight and the light weight.\r\n\r\nThe
  only Tempo digitizations I can find that use the name 'Tempo' are the grunged <a
  href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/tempo-rr/\">Tempo Medium</a> from
  Red Rooster, which is the Roman only, and the <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/tempo/\">Heavy
  Condensed</a> version from Monotype/Agfa.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anyone knows of
  a digitized version of the italic in the lighter weights?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n-
  Mike Yanega"

  body: "The Tempo italic is quite distinctive due to the baseline serifs. The person
    who sent the ID request was hoping to locate a digital version. Mark's post on
    the 10490 thread shows this (thanks Riccardo. I had forgotten that thread, which
    I posted in.)  Futura, while similar in other ways does not have that design.\r\n\r\nI
    guess I will accept that it's not (yet) in digital form. Bummer!\r\n\r\n- Mike
