body: "Hi There. First time post.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for the variant of Futura that
  IKEA is currently using. The closest one I have found is Elsner+Flake Futura New
  (which I can't even find for purchase anywhere, but did find on Identifont).\r\n\r\nIt's
  similar to that, and EF Futura 6 Heavy, with some differences. In general, the differences
  that I have noted between most versions of Futura and the IKEA 2005 catalog version
  (Heavy/Bold weight) are:\r\n\r\nIn the IKEA version...\r\n\r\n$ has line through
  entire glyph\r\nS and $ shaped more like S from Avenir\r\nj curved *unlike* E+F
  New, but *like* most editions of Futura\r\n1 has angled serif\r\nM and W have flat
  spurs\r\n, \" are rounded\r\ne has angled tail even in Bold weight\r\nm and n are
  slightly less \"symmetrical\"\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be most appreciated. Thanks!"

  body: Definitely a properity typeface, it's mentioned <a href="http://www.ascendercorp.com/TypeDesigners/robin_nicholas.html">here</a>
    that <a href="http://www.fonts.com/AboutFonts/DesignerProfiles/RobinNicholas.htm">Robin
    Nicholas</a> (Arial) designed "weights of <strong>a geometric sans face</strong>"
    specially for IKEA, I guess that was Futura.

  body: "\"IKEA Sans\" is a corporate typeface that was designed for IKEA by Stockholm
    Design Lab in 2000 to better meet the demands of packaging design and signage,
    than the previously used \"Futura\" typeface. It was later implemented on all
    communication for IKEA. \r\n\r\nType specimens:\r\nhttp://www.stockholmdesignlab.se/#/1112/library/clients/ikea/ikea/\r\n\r\nLars,
