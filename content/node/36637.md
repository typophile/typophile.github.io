    between some of the letters..  like the A and V in LEAVING\r\nand the C in SECTEUR
    is also a give-away.\r\n\r\nhowever..\r\nthere ought to have been some font they
    have had as model when the made it!?!?\r\n\r\n\r\nand the German \"SIE VERLASSEN....\"

    exhibition I am having in Gothenburg, Sweden next week. it starts September 8
    and it is sort of a selfportrait of me as a Berlin Mauer and all these silly walls
    we people set up/upset or build to shut in/out other people..  so I am rebuilding
    Der Mauer...  but my own Mauer. \"I love the wall and the wall loves me\" paraphrasing
    Joseph Beuys.\r\n\r\nso know I need to know if it should be <strong>DEN</strong>
    or <strong>DER</strong> in the German line: \r\n\r\n\r\n<cite><strong>SIE VERLASSEN

    interesting. Post some photos of the exhibition."

  body: "\"Hinterland\" is - from the viewpoint of the center of whatever place -
    what is behind the frontier.\r\nE.g. the \"Hinterland\" of a city is the belt
    of smaller villages around it. They all are in relationship to the center (the
    city), their farmers bring their products to the city's markets and buy whatever
    in the cities.\r\n\r\nMilitary-based \"Hinterland\" is the area behind \"The Front\",
    where e.g. in WW1 all wounded soldiers came first to be taken care of, ammunition-magazines
    and so on.\r\n\r\nIn West-Berlin the problem was, that there was only a \"Hinterland\"
    from the communist site, but not from the West-Berlin site. There was the city
    with the wall around it.\r\nCrazy times... and the communist custums was not joking.
