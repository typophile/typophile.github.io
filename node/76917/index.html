Design competitions are indeed generally frowned on by professional design organizations and by many  designers. Nobody would think of asking a group of doctors or accountants (or most any other professional) to work for free in the hope that 1 person will get paid at the end, and professional designers shouldn't be asked to work that way either.

But with that said, I'd agree with you that not all designers agree with that, especially those just starting their business and those hit hard by the bad economy. I've done it once or twice myself. But it's not good for the profession.

It's accurate. Professional organizations such as the AIGA and GDC don't just frown, they prohibit members from spec work.

I consider all type competitions (including type annuals that request submissions) to be spec work, because they require type designers to create a specimen. And they don't even reimburse winners for the cost of doing that.

I was on Creative Review's mailing list for its new type annual, to which I replied,

"Thank you for your interest in my work.
However, I am not disposed to compete for the privilege of providing
your publication with free content."

...and was subsequently "followed up on" several times with comments such as,

"I am aware that previously there was an issue with the fee for an entry,
therefore if you are interested in submitting a typeface or typefaces we
would be willing to offer you a further discount."

The ethics of not doing spec work can seem out of place in the digital era.

**

To return to the topic, even if a client commits to a custom solution, the first step is often narrowing the focus of the brief by seeing which off-the-shelf designs come close to the desired tone and style. 

I'm having difficulty visualizing a vaulted-cellar bar as being either upscale or contemporary, but suggest you set up "R55" in the text field and search at MyFonts under the keyword "luxury", "upscale", or "contemporary".

But I was wrong.
Apparently in the US prohibiting spec work is considered price fixing, so frowning is all the AIGA can do.
However, as a member of the RGD (Ontario, Canada), I am prohibited from doing spec work.</div>

Interesting; I didn't know that.

However even if AIGA could prohibit it, designers would be under no legal obligation to follow the AIGA's advice. It's not a union or licensing authority.  Their authority just comes from members' respect for their advice. </div>

Because my knowledge of fonts, especially remembering their names, isn't as good as it should be, I started this thread hoping for a little help to get started. 

@Nick: Maybe I'm using the wrong words, but in my opinion luxury, upscale and contemporary can go together. 

I'm thinking a (customized) classic serif font used in a contemporary way.
The attached images show what I mean. Sorry if I'm expressing myself incorrectly.

This is a mischaracterization (and I'm sure you're smart enough -and a good enough businessman- to know that). Although it was indeed a competition (meaning one can lose) it's basically a marketing gambit: pay a small fee for a chance to be seen.

When they approached me, it was a no-brainer (even more so than when they ran their contest in 2006). And I just found out that I'm included! Ergo: I get some superbly placed advertising for dirt cheap.

On the other hand, if I were just-another-Latin-foundry I would have been much more tentative - since my chances of being included would have been much lower. But still, one has to have a pretty low opinion of one's own work to think $70 is too much.

The only competitions that chap my hide are the ones that charge you for winning!  :-/

As a graphic designer, I resent providing that service for free, to be discarded on the whim of someone who is not a client.

One reason I think this approach is elegant is that good type designers are not necessarily good layout designers.

But then you have to pay much more money. If you do the math it becomes clear that your chances of being selected have to be quite low for the gambit to not be worth it.

		<div class="commentbody">These are the specs:

<em>For each typeface you are submitting please provide a full character set. This should at minimum consist of complete upper and lower case alphabets and numerals 0 – 9 but, in the case of extensive Open Type faces, please also submit a representative sample of extra characters. For Arabic or other non-Latin faces where character sets may vary, please exercise discretion and submit what you consider to be a sufficient character set for the judges to be able to make their choice. These should be supplied at 48 point, as should, as a bare minimum, the sample sentence The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Non-Latin entries may substitute a similar or equivalent phrase. We would also encourage entrants to submit additional samples to show their typeface in use. You may include headlines, short or long passages of text, or sample layouts showing the typeface in use in eg advertising or publications. With Display or Bespoke entries where entire upper and lower case alphabets or numeral sets do not exist, please supply all the characters available. If the typeface is to be used to set text, please also submit 200 words of dummy text of your choosing set in the following: 8/10 pt, 10/12pt, 12/14 pt. This applies to all Text entries and may also apply to Bespoke or Non-Latin typefaces. Each entry should be set in 100% black on A3 and be provided as a separate 300 dpi PDF, with a maximum file size of 5mb, with the name of the typeface clearly marked on each page.</em>

Why don't they level the playing field and provide a template?
Because that would be too boring, their book would look like a type catalog.
So this way they can have a bit of a format, but enough variety of creative input to make it slightly more interesting.

These publishers are cheap, they knew enough about me to solicit my entry, but couldn't be bothered to have a look-see if any of my faces, all of which have copious PDF specimens, were suitable for their publication. That would have been too much like work, and they would have had to pay whoever was doing it, e.g. give the selection committee a curation fee, rather then just paying them off with the publicity and kudos of being important enough to pass judgment on their peers.

I can understand that the publishers might think this is the same model as for other creative awards, but for ads and brochures etc., those don't have to be specially made up. 

Typographica has a good plan for its "fonts of the year"; ask each curator to pick one typeface and write a few words about it -- not too onerous a task -- and then ask the chosen foundry to prepare a specimen, with the guarantee of publication.

@Hrant: <em>If you do the math it becomes clear that your chances of being selected have to be quite low for the gambit to not be worth it.</em>

I prefer not to gamble on this sort of thing. Besides, there are other reasons I don't do competitions, apart from value for money.</div>

There's an entry fee per typeface.
Did you want them to choose the ones they liked and bill you?  :-)

> I prefer not to gamble

I never gamble. Gambling is dumb luck. This however is based on the ability to judge the value of one's work in the eyes of others, and to be committed to promoting it.

If someone wants to use my fonts to decorate the pages of a book, they can license them.
If someone wants me to design a page of a book, to a somewhat unimaginative brief, they can ask me for a proposal, but I suspect I would be "too busy".

<em>...the ability to judge the value of one's work in the eyes of others </em>

I would be very disappointed if my work appealed to the arbiters of taste.
That's another reason I don't do competitions.</div>
