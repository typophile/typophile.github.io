body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I am designing Armenian fonts. The glyph names in the unicode standard
  are in the form &#34;ARMENIAN CAPITAL LETTER AYB&#34;. <BR> <BR>Initially I only
  used the last word, which is the name of the character in Armenian, and it was working
  fine, except it did not recognize otf fonts as being Armenian fonts. <BR> <BR>I
  changed the glyph names to the standard name, and now it gives me errors when I
  try to generate fonts. Plus I do not know how to use these names in the OpenType
  features. <BR> <BR>Are the names genreating the problems? Is there some way of addressing
  these glyphs?

    of the document. I believe Adobe products do use names, Microsoft programs use
    the Unicode index. But you &#40;we&#41; need someone like Adam or Thomas for the
    definitive answer. <BR> <BR>In the meantime, try <BR> <BR><a href="http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=3065"

  body: Adam, I read the &#34;Glyph Naming and Encoding&#34; article and now I am
    more confused. According to the article a glyph name should not contain spaces,
    which is good and solves my problem. However, the glyph names defined by the unicode
    standard 4.0 for the armenian characters include spaces. <BR> <BR>Is this a problem
    with the unicode standard? Can I ignore the unicode standard naming scheme to
    have a more compatible and reliable one? Is it possible to ask that they change
    the naming? <BR> <BR>ps. the site <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/glyphlist.txt"
    target="_blank">http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/glyphlist.txt</a>
    has the name &#34;Aybarmenian&#34; instead of &#34;ARMENIAN CAPITAL LETTER AYB&#34;.
    Should I use that name?

  body: Levon, parev! Nice to have a fellow Armenian &#40;and a Beirutsi at that&#41;
    on this forum. <BR> <BR>I wish I could help you to any useful extent, but my only
    experience with making Armenian Unicode fonts is from the Fontographer days -
    I haven&#39;t had a chance to get to grips with how FontLab does it, although
    soon enough I will have to bite the bullet. I expect it&#39;s a lot easier than
    what I had to do with Fontographer though &#40;I remember having to run it through
    Michael Everson for a quick technical quality check&#41;. So I think those who
    have more Unicode experience &#40;even if it&#39;s not Armenian-specific&#41;
    will end up helping you more. <BR> <BR>BTW, I saw your other thread too, but I
    have dozens of Typophile threads flagged for eventual :-/ perusal so it&#39;s
    hard to find the time for everything. Plus I owe Miguel &#40;Sousa&#41; a full
    personal reply on his project first... I hope one day soon I can help, somehow.

  body: Levon,  <BR> <BR>1. The human-readable long names used in the Unicode Standard
    have &#42;nothing&#42; to do with glyph names.  <BR> <BR>2. The article <a href="http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=3065"

    points to an old location of the Adobe Glyph List for New Fonts. Unfortunately,
    the Adobe site incorrectly forwards the URL to <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/glyphlist.txt"
    target="_blank">http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/glyphlist.txt</a>
    <BR> <BR>This URL should &#42;not&#42; be used for devising glyph names. The correct
    URL for the Adobe Glyph List for New Fonts is <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/aglfn13.txt"
    target="_blank">http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/aglfn13.txt</a>  <BR>
    <BR>We will soon post the corrected guidelines.  <BR> <BR>Since the Armenian glyph
    names are not in the AGLFN, please use the uniXXXX names. So for ARMENIAN CAPITAL
    LETTER AYB, you should use the name &#34;uni0531&#34;, just like Charles explained.  <BR>

  body: Thank you guys. <BR> <BR>Is it possible to suggest the glyph names to adobe,
    or whoever is responsible? There are two different dialects &#40;Eastern and Western&#41;
    with their own pronunciation and spelling, but it is possible to find a middle
    ground.

    comes naturally to us Armenians :-&#41; but it sort of goes against the cultural
    ideology at the heart of something like the Unicode Consortium. I myself apply
    such a middle ground &#40;for example when informally transliterating proper names,
    for the benefit of non-Armenians&#41; but I don&#39;t expect that of formal institutions
    &#40;at least not Western ones, not these days&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: The problem is, on those rare occasions when glyph names matter, you need
    applications to recognize those glyph names. There is no technical advantage to
    be gained from adding new glyph names, only incompatibilities. <BR> <BR>This is
    also why the list of glyph names acceptable to be used for new fonts is much much
    shorter than the list of glyph names we suggest applications try to recognize.
    In the first case, we are recommending that font developers use the narrowest,
    most compatible set of names and naming schemes. In the latter case, we are recommending
    that application developers try to recognize glyph names from any of a variety
    of competing standards, including some that conflict with each other &#40;like
    Adobe&#39;s and Apple&#39;s for some names&#41;. <BR> <BR>Currently, we have no
    intention of ever expanding either of those lists again. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

  body: '&#62; Is it possible to suggest the glyph names  <BR>&#62; to adobe, or whoever
    is responsible? <BR> <BR>Levon,  <BR> <BR>there is no need for that. The current
    naming guidelines practically cover all cases, and most importantly, they set
    up a referential scheme to an internationally acknowledged standard &#40;Unicode/ISO
    10646&#41;. I realize that the names &#34;uniXXXX&#34; are not necessarily human-readable
    so using them in production may be cumbersome. This is why some developers are
    using their own &#34;human-readable&#34; glyph names in production and rename
    the glyphs to Adobe/FontLab-compatible names before shipping their fonts.  <BR>
    <BR>For batch glyph renaming, you can use the macro available from  <BR><a href="http://steroids.fontlab.net/"

  body: Personally I am hoping that I can find some way of using FontLab; next week
    I will be at the Unicode conference in Berlin, and I will take the tutorial. I
    have a lot of legacy stuff with legacy names, and have had pretty much terrible
    problems dealing with encoding, names, and so on in FontLab. There&#39;s got to
    be a solution, but it&#39;s not out of the box.

  body: Using the uniXXXX names is not a big problem. However, I would prefer &#34;human-readable&#34;
    names. It will reduce the time I spend on preparing kerning tables, OT features,
    etc. <BR> <BR>Adam, I will try the macro you suggested. If I can work with my
    glyph names to prepare everything, and then change them back to the uniXXXX name,
    it will save me a lot of time, confusion, and errors. But it means that I will
    need to keep 2 copies of each font.

  body: Levon, the way I handle this is to make two FontLab encoding files, one with
    &#39;development name&#39; &#40;i.e. human friendly&#41; and one with the glyphs
    names that will be written to the final font &#40;uniXXXX, AGL, or some combination&#41;.
    Then I use Adam&#39;s macro to switch glyph naming back and forth as I need to.
    Generally, I do all my work with the development name, and only switch to the
    final names when I need to generate a font. I only maintain one FontLab source,
    usually with the development names.
