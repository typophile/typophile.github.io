  Type grew out of the first international type-design competition, the 2001 bukva:raz!,
  whose goal was to promote global cultural pluralism, interaction, and diversity
  in typographic communications. The book lavishly presents the winning entries, along
  with information about each typeface, its language, and its designer. A series of
  essays gives context for the interplay of types and languages in the world today
  \u2014 including the attempt to mesh all existing scripts into a single digital
  encoding system called Unicode. It also delves into the specific issues around developing
  typefaces for the many linguistic cultures in the world, from the various Cyrillic
  letterforms to Vietnam\u2019s ancient ideographic script."
