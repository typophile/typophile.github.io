body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI was wondering this: In a bold the x-height is often
  slightly increased to optically match the x-height of the regular. However, this
  will cause the ascenders to look shorter (compared to what they look like without
  increasing x-height). Shouldn't the descenders be made shorter too, to match the
  acsenders? Any examples/advise is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper"

  body: 'Well, technically the ascenders not only <em>look</em> but actually <em>are</em>
    shorter when you increase just the x-height. So conversely, one might increase
    not just the x-height but also ascender height (and possibly cap height) plus
    descender depth as well, to keep extenders the same length. See for instance Adobe
    Caslon, example image in this thread: http://typophile.com/node/65057 (Shifting
    Vertical Metrics for Darker Weights)'
