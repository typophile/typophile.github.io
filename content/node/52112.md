  body: "Can someone explain to me the difference between justified left and flush
    left? Where did the terms\r\njustified left\r\njustified center\r\n&\r\njustified
    right\r\ncome from?\r\nWhat do they mean.\r\n\r\nJustification was always the
    process of causing a set line to be the width of the measure; originally in machine-set
    type, by space bands that expanded to fill the measure.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I'm seeing
    \"justified\" applied in a way that makes no sense at all.\r\n\r\nAnd, this query
    really confuses me: Roman numerals are individual characters. How can they \"justify\"
    in any fashion at all?\r\n\r\nCurt Akin"

  body: "Left justified means that you justify all lines except for the last one which
    is ragged but left-aligned.\r\nCenter justified means that you justify all lines
    except for the last one which is ragged but center-aligned.\r\nRight justify means
    that you justify all lines except for the last one which is right-aligned.\r\n\r\nBut,
    agreed, the question is confusing.  I presume he means in a list if things should
    appear like:\r\n\r\n<code>I.____\r\nII.___\r\nIII.__\r\nIIII._\r\nV.____\r\nXVIII.\r\n
    \  e</code>\r\nor\r\n<code>____I.\r\n___II.\r\n__III.\r\n_IIII.\r\n____V.\r\nXVIII.</code>\r\nor\r\n<code>__I.__\r\n_II.__\r\n_III._\r\n_IIII.\r\n__V.__\r\nXVIII.</code>\r\n\r\n(okay
    it's hard to center 2-3 characters in monowidth).  Also, off topic, is it possible
    to show whitespace on \xABcode\xBB because, well, it's kind of important for codes.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "I think he means when they are in a column.\r\nFor instance, arabic numerals
    are set flush right, so that corresponding powers of ten line up vertically.\r\nHowever,
    that principle doesn't apply to roman numerals, so having a pair of adjacent columns
    flush right-flush left may seem a bit ungainly, if there is no real need for it."
