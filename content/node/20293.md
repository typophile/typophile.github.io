  site in silence!\r\n\r\ni cant really find anything - i'm wondering if someone can
  give me a rundown on how/why fontlab and illustrator talk to each other (in terms
  of the document size etc).\r\n\r\nis there a standard ill file setup for font design
  that can be used in conjunction with fontlab? \r\n\r\ni hope i'm being clear here.
  thanks"
