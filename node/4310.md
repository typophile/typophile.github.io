body: Hi All. <BR> <BR>I figured I would consult this knowledgeable group with my
  question. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to use the House Gothic 23 font set.  Looking
  at the House Industries website at the typefaces available with House Gothic 23
  &#40;extended, condensed&#41;, I can&#39;t seem to find any of those in the set
  I have -- <BR> <BR>I have ones called Bold 1, Bold 2, Bold 3, Bold 4 <BR>Also Light
  1, 2, 3, 4 <BR> <BR>I know with some House fonts there is a key combination you
  need to do to access some of the styles.  Or am I just missing something?  I see
  14 elements in my HouseGothic 23 folder. <BR> <BR>thanks so much in advance <BR>-sg

    and helpful. And your initial impression is correct: the whole House Gothic family
    is a big one which has been added to at least once since it&#39;s initial release.'
