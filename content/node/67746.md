  vertically, the "MIAMI", and the font in the tagline "OUR FLOWERS MEAN BUSINESS".  If
  anyone knows what any of these are, just one even will help.  Thank you so much!!  '

  body: 'the closest I''ve come to is Trebuchet.  I thought it might be Fruitger,
    but that font has flats on the tops of the "M", and the above doesn''t.  And the
    "R" in Futura is different so that''s out too.  The "E" on Trebuchet though has
    even length top & bottom horizontal lines, where as the "E" above has a slightly
    longer bottom line than the top one.  Uggh, help!  Thanks!  '

  body: okay, i's not Trebuchet either. The lines in the "F" in Flowers are equal
    length in the logo tagline, and the 'F' in Trebuchet has a shorter bottom length
    leg.  Sorry, I don't know the correct terms!
