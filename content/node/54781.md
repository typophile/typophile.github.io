body: I've added small caps to a font that I've already done some class-based kerning
  on. Is there a way I can tell FontLab to generate classes for (or find existing
  classes for) the new small caps glyphs without losing the kerning I've already done?

    the saved .flc file and in the open dialog, enable the Append option. '
