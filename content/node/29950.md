  maybe someone knows anyway:\r\nI registered my copy of CS2, to get my \"free Garamond
  Premier Pro\" as a benefit, but after registering via help --> registration and
  filling out the form, nothing happens.\r\nFurther, I don't find any information
  on the adobe website how to get the font, the only information I can find is that
  der *is* the font as one of some possible bonus (the same information I already
  have printed in my manual addition).\r\n... But no forms, logins, download-links...\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help\r\nSebastian"

    to send you an email after you register your products, but i never got one. i
    filled out a on-line customer service request, and still haven't heard from them.
    maybe Thomas can fill us in..."
