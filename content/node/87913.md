body: I'm having to recreate this logo since the client can't provide us with the
  original file, or even a higher resolution image to use, and I'm having trouble
  with the fonts for the text. I'm almost positive that the font for "Property Management"
  is Rum Sans, but I can't be certain. If it is, does anyone know of a similar font
  that is free? I don't have the budget to purchase fonts at the moment, so I have
  to make do with what I can find. The other font I haven't figured out yet. Thanks
  in advance for any help!

    for a top quality logo,\r\nhe/she must pay the extra cost for the original fonts.\r\n"

    get them to send us a better logo file, but apparently it's just not happening.
    I have let it be known that I can only do so much with what I'm given and I cannot
    work miracles, but there are others above me that have more say in what happens,
    so. I just do what I can. I appreciate the help."
