body: "Afternoon,\r\n\r\nJust wondering what the views here are to an online library/catalog
  where work could be referenced and viewed in relation to it's typeface (maybe by
  tagging in the meta-data), so that you could search for a typeface and see it in
  context as opposed to just as an alphabet list?\r\n\r\nDo you think this would have
  any useful application, possibly for students/academia?\r\n\r\nReally interested
  to see what you think.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nChris\r\n"

  body: "@ David R and Koppa\r\n\r\nThanks for replying, I'm actually looking at it
    as part of my MA research, it's involved with new and effective ways to catalogue
    and preserve type, but has stretched to looking at design in general and provide
    learning resources for students and teachers alike.\r\n\r\nI just want to see
    what sort of reaction the concept gets from the type/design community before I
    launch headlong into it!\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for what you would like to see
    included in such a tool would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nChris."

    freelance designers, smaller studios and students to upload and catalogue work,
    and maintained so that I can hopefully get some of the bigger studios and design
    groups involved. I'm thinking I'd have to carefully monitor it though so as to
    make sure it doesn't end up breaching any copyright.\r\n\r\nThanks for the heads
    up on that one, maybe they'll hold a copy at St Martins, I'll have to give them
    a go next time I'm in."

    I think possibly loses to some extent it's international appeal that an independent

    for feedback, I think possibly having a section like wikicommons for uploading
    of pictures where they can be linked to maybe a wiki article on the typeface itself,
    therefore reinforcing the emphasis on the type?\r\n\r\nThe actual judging of a
    piece and being able to moderate raises all sorts of issues, as I agree, how do
    you say what is good/bad, etc. when design and style is so subjective?\r\n\r\nAnd

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nNot sure which direction you want this to come from: Is it
    about typefaces, and examples of them in use, or is it about graphic design, with
    extra info about typefaces used? The first is a resource I think everyone would
    welcome, and the rights and permissions of that shouldn't be terribly restrictive.
    The second sounds like a portfolio site, with lots of feedback, bickering and
    contention, and also doesn't sound like something people need. I see no need for
    \"judging\" or other ratings or feedback; that sounds like it goes against the
    intention of a resource that helps people understand how typefaces perform. Who
    cares which one is your favorite? I think what people need is a place to see how
    type looks in various settings, and what it can do for them, before they buy it.
    Is that what you're thinking of?\r\n\r\nIf it's about the typefaces rather than
    the products using them, then you do have the challenge of selecting faces to
    feature. Over time, you could have a lot of typefaces in the library. But every
    free, grunge, and rip-off face doesn't need a page of examples. Newer designs
    without a lot of popular exposure could very much benefit from this kind of demonstration/example
    site. People are always asking for specimens, and asking if anyone has used a
    particular face, and how well it works. "

    what I had in mind.\r\n\r\nRegarding \"judging\" and subjectivity...this goes
    back to my previous post. It's not about favorites or style...the proposed star
    ratings would be about \"this is a good (as in the type is approriate and set
    correctly) example\" and this example is \"not as good.\" This would only be necessary
    if it was an open portfolio like Flickr, which would undoubtedly attract posters
    of varying skill, knowledge, and experience, and likely be heavy with lesser experienced
    students and amateurs who cannot wait to see their work posted on the site.\r\n\r\nI'll
    assume that people who know what they're doing wouldn't need this resource and
    wouldn't have much time to dedicate to it.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden this is beginning
    to sound like a train wreck.\r\n\r\nBut maybe if it was typographers rating the
    use of type in work done by designers, there'd be some shared interest among both
    professional communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a trade off. Any community site depends heavily on the community that participates
    on it. The more open you want the community, the more open you have to allow submissions
    to be. The more closed, the more administrative time and effort that would go
    into maintaining it all and filtering the submissions in some objective fashion.\r\n\r\nRemember
    that a rating system is only as good as the knowledge of the raters. ;o)"

  body: "In terms of judging, I think it would be closer to moderating, more of whether
    a piece is a suitable example of that typeface in use as opposed to the personal
    preference of the viewer. If means and time allowing there was a want for it to
    open up to provide extra resource for other disciplines, then that is something
    that I would have to consider.\r\n\r\nThe main idea for now is to have a central
    reference for design, focusing heavily on the typography and how it is used in
    context, not just to help judge the suitability or the usability of a typeface
    you might be considering for a piece, but also as a permanent record of that typeface
    and a research/teaching resource for students and academia (although I could see
    it open to all sorts of 'find this typeface' assignment abuse). I wouldn't want
    it to end up purely as an extended marketing tool for the type foundries, although
    I think if they were interested they could be invaluable to enriching the user
    experience.\r\n\r\nI would like the focus when concerned with submissions to be
    more towards established studios/designers/typographers/etc. but I don't see it
    as unfeasible to have an 'education' section that works with universities to provide
    coverage of their degree shows, this way I would hope that the students might
    use the resource and then be showing, hopefully work that in some way has benefited
    from it. Also bearing in mind that todays students are tomorrows designers and
    with luck they would as they progress add to the library and essentially be giving
    something back to the design community."
