  FF DIN in FontShop Bestsellers-list. I thought that was a mistake, but helpul guys
  from FontShop confirmed it's true.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Happy_5609.png]\r\nI'm
  a happy camper."

    is drawn with mouse on screen, with beziers, and this script touched ink for the
    first time when I took my first test print."

  body: "Not in FontLab. In RoboFog. I still think it's better for glyph design. So
    does Schwartz. It was designed by type designers. FontLab is very clearly made
    by engineers.\r\n\r\nBut yes; I had samples of some Swedish Art Directors hand
    writing, and I went from that. \r\n\r\nGo see my TeeBrush in Linotype. Same thing,
    but with no samples, I just draw that one on screen."

  body: Hmm, sounds like RoboFog could be worth investigating. I hadn't heard of it.

  body: "RoboFog is a brilliant program from LettError. They took \u2013 then redundant
    \u2013 Fontographer 3.5 and re-built it with Python features, and generally tweaked
    it to type designer-friendly way.\r\n\r\nI still have a laptop with OS9 just because
    RoboFog is a Classic program."
