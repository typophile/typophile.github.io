  shows up(!)\r\n[also see the logo \"Sunbelt\" at: http://www.sunbeltsnacks.com/];
  if not, I think that it is <strong>Textile</strong>, an Apple font. Can anyone suggest
  a similar font in a Windows format? The closest I've found so far is called\r\n<strong>Rostrum</strong>
  ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/rostrum/ ). Another somewhat similar one
  is \r\n<strong>Challenge Bold</strong> ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/challenge-bold/
  ). Neither is as close as I'd like. \r\n\r\nI see this font used very often on food
  packaging - cereals, etc - and that's the look I'm after.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much,\r\n- Paul"

    suggestion; thanks!\r\n\r\nIt might well work for me. It's perhaps a bit more
    flourishy (sorry, I'm not well versed in typography vocabulary) than would be
    ideal (<strong>Textile</strong> is quite a bit plainer), so any other suggestions
    would also be appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n- Paul"

  body: "I was going to recommend <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/lucida-cas-d/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Lucida Casual Italic</a>, which has a great deal in common with
    Textile. No coincidence, as both were created by by Kris Holmes. It would have
    required some artificial bolding.\r\n\r\nNever mind that, though. I just happened
    across the recently released <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/lucida-big-casual/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Lucida Big Casual T Demi Italic</a> - which is a veritable match
    for Textile."

    match for textile, which is just what I asked for - Thanks so much!\r\n\r\nBut
    now that you folks have recommended these other great choices, I've got a difficult
    decision to make. Which is great! Thanks!\r\n\r\n[Note to <em>alepaul</em> and

    it was a system font. So, if you want to generate a new brand package ID I suggest
    a new option or maybe a custom work. Best"
