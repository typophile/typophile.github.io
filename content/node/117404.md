    that book but they're too deep in the gara... archives at the moment.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    have it, or they could get it by interlibrary loan, which is usually free. Or
    they might have other sources that give the answer. Talk to someone in the library's
    reference department, they are experts at finding info.\r\n\r\nI'd assume the
    name comes from the resemblance to a real bullet from certain angles. That's also
    what Wikipedia says, although I'd try to verify that from a more reliable source."

  body: When Googling the subject, someone said that the Oxford English Dictionary
    (OED) discusses its history. You can't access it online without a subscription,
    but your library probably has a copy.

  body: A Google search did not turn up much about the history of the bullet point
    itself, but it did turn up facts about the history of its predecessors. Apparently
    the dingbat that was a picture of a pointing hand was the first typographical
    symbol used for this purpose, starting in the 12th century and continuing all
    the way into the 18th century.

  body: Not just "from certain angles." Actual bullets were generally spherical up
    until the American Civil War. The word itself means "little ball".
