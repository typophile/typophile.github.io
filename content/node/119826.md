body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI'm working on updating my site's code from XHTML 1.1 to
  XHTML 5, part of that includes the music player. For years I've used an image for
  the media control characters though now since I'm doing the design update I want
  to make it easy for people who create themes to change the colors of the controls
  hence fonts and hence why I eventually wandered to these forums.\r\n\r\nEither one
  of two goals would work fine for me. First I've spent time browsing and searching
  through Unicode character sheets for existing characters with some success. Then
  after having little-to-no luck decided to mess around with the idea creating a font
  specific to media control characters, at least for now. I've downloaded and installed
  FontForge, created a new font and am having some difficulty determining how to create
  characters beyond #255 (in red at the top-left). If I go this route I don't want
  to use an existing font as I want to ensure what I create is purely free to use
  by others. Alternatively I'd be happy to use an existing purely free font.\r\n\r\nHere
  is an image of the media control characters I'm trying to find or at least create...\r\n\r\n<img
  alt=\"Example Media Control Characters\" src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/m90qr.png\"
  />\r\n\r\nHere are some of the characters I've found though don't seem to be well
  supported by any of the fonts I've tried...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23ee\">Previous
  Track</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23f5\">Play
  Track</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23f8\">Pause
  Track</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23f9\">Stop
  Track</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23ef\">Next
  Track</a>\r\n\r\nFor those having a look there are some inconsistencies between
  the characters (specifically previous and next track symbols).\r\n\r\nSo what are
  my options? Are there any truly free TTF/WOFF fonts with support for these universal
  media control characters? If not how do I create these characters in a new font
  using FontForge or other open source or freeware software?"

    thing. Thanks for your help, I greatly appreciate it!"

  body: "#xf049; etc. are Private Use characters. They are best being avoided, because
    their meaning is not defined, so when the specific web font doesn\u2019t load,
    they can\u2019t be displayed in a fallback font.\r\n\r\nYou had the correct codes
    in your first post, you should definitely continue to use these (#x23ee; ...)\r\n\r\nThe
    FontFont UI Icons collection contains all these symbols, designed to work together,
    but the fonts are not free: https://www.fontfont.com/news/new-release-ff67 (scroll

  body: "Agree with Jens. For a large number of the characters Font Awesome provides
    (e.g. euro, dollar, bank, chart, credit card, checkboxes, refresh, wheelchair...),
    there's no reason valid codepoints couldn't have been used! \r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    the approach that is being advocated by the FA site is that these icons are mere
    adornments meant to enhance the display. If the concept of \"play\", \"pause\",
    etc <em>is</em> your message, these should be conveyed in the content of your
    page, not in the stylesheet. Or as it has [[http://technotes.iangreenleaf.com/posts/font-awesome-not-awesome.html|already
    been said...]]"

  body: "I will admit it is not a perfect solution however I need a basis for the
    long term and it works best for the moment. I'm not sure how to do any of this
    in SVG and on other sites more relevant to that I received no response. Private
    characters, I agree, they can change. The article wasn't written by someone coming
    off as mature, much more opinion based. Seeing as I'm building my own platform
    and making certain completely-free fonts available one of my goals is (as with
    all things I work on) to improve performance and standards; <em>fontawesome.woff</em>
    is 64KB which is simply too much just for <em>just</em> media control characters.
    I'll try to learn to create a standalone woff file and assign the characters to
    the appropriate numeric ids; there aren't enough (at least that I see offhand)
    though it would improve upon the works-already resolution I've come to. Eventually
    I'd love to create my own fonts though such a goal beyond my immediate goal is
    quaternary at best.\r\n\r\nThe most relevant thing I can ask at this point is
    how do I create a minimal font with these characters in FontForge? By default
    it doesn't allow more than 255 characters and excessive poking around hasn't helped
    me to figure out how to define any characters beyond the numeric id of 255 in
    FontForge.\r\n\r\nThere will always be people who take it upon themselves to say,
    \"No, don't do that.\" as if they have some sort of official standing that entitles
    them to dictate beyond having the freedom to share an opinion. If such people
    have a better idea that they are also willing to teach how to implement then great,
    otherwise they've just another naysayer and naysayers are just people that people
    such as myself ignore; there is always an answer even if it's not what you think
    it is."

    body: "I've created fonts with thousands of characters in FontForge. I don't know
      why you're seeing it limited to only 255. Maybe it has to do with the encoding
      you are using. Try Encoding > Reencode > Unicode.\r\n\r\nGranted, the page I
      linked to was rantish. There are plenty of other pages that state the case in
      a better way, but the message is the same. If you are creating a nice \">>\"
      glyph, why not put it in the common codepoint (u+23e9)? Using PUA just recreates
      the old early-1990s problem of using Symbol to type Greek characters - give
      the document to someone that doesn't have that font, and it looks like gibberish."

    only 65536. The basic UI controls are all in the BMP, but if you ever want to
    expand upon that, there are some in Plane 1 too. I don't know of any reason not

  body: "FontForge is crashing at every <em><strong>EVERY</strong></em> opportunity,
    touching the scrollbars, dragging windows from the second screen to the first
    because it's too dumb to remember the window preference, it Macintosh \"maximizes\"
    on my laptop (which means it just resizes the window arbitrarily and about ten
    thousand other different retarded combinations of retardedness) and that was after
    all the fuss on my desktop. All I was trying to do was a very simply cut/paste
    (and I don't copy because when I did it kept pasting the first character even
    though I <em>explicitly</em> copied the second). FontForge is absolutely infuriating
    to work with, I think even Moby -Dick would get bored and go home and check his
    email at this point.\r\n\r\nIn FontAwesome I need the following characters to
    appear on my website from left to right in the following numeric order...\r\n\r\n61,513\r\n61,512\r\n61,514\r\n61,515\r\n61,516\r\n61,518\r\n61,521\r\n61,520\r\n\r\nSince
    there are eight characters but only seven spaces I attempted to start at character
    9192 since overshooting to 9,200 is an alarm clock and apparently the only reference
    to character 9192 was something about ... drunk Japanese people? You know Unicode
    would make a lot more sense if there were <em>numerical</em> indexes that used
    hex as a secondary index reference...\r\n\r\nChristTrekker, I would greatly appreciate
    it seeing as I can't even save more than a single character before the program
    makes the Hindenburg look like an overwhelming success. I'm not sure what the
    characters look like and I'm not sure if all the characters I want are there so
    would it be possible if someone could also please copy/paste from FontAwesome
    like I as attempting <em>just</em> those characters to those numeric positions
    and export to a WOFF format?"
