body: This font is on the tip of my tongue but I just can't quite match it or think
  of what it is called. Hoping someone out there will know it straight away. The giveaways
  are the C, J, S, R and A. Thanks in advance.

  body: Thanks Nick. It is somewhere around a Futura ExtraBold. I think they might
    have modified it because I have tried the several versions of Futura ExtraBold
    that I have and the S and C in particular are not quite there. Again, maybe they
    played with it from the original font.
