  do typographic research? I'm not referring to classes, but rather archives and like
  places where someone could see, hold, and research actual type examples.\r\n\r\nWashington
  University in St. Louis has a great facility for this, but I was wondering if anyone
  here knew about other places.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nChuck"

  body: The Maurice Annenberg Collection of Type Specimen Catalogs at the University
    of Maryland, College Park, is a treasure trove of information and has the added
    advantage of being close to the Library of Congress, which is also an estimable
    research resource.

    the great old books the Library of Congress has no equal. You can come in off
    the street, fill out a few forms, get a library card, and then have the rare books
    librarian set you down at a desk with a dozen Jenson editions. "

    and the [[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/research/info/|Harry Ransom Center]] at U.
    Texas-Austin. Spent a month solid in each place and didn't get through all their
    materials. Both are open to any adult researchers. The Newberry Library in Chicago,
    I have heard, also has an outstanding collection and is likewise open.\r\n\r\nI
    didn't get to the [[http://www.museumofprinting.org/|Museum of Printing]] while
    in Massachusetts, but I sense they may have more of the archival objects you're
    talking about. "

    type itself their big treasure is the library of 300,000 drawings of type from
    the Mergenthaler Linotype company. This isn''t handling the type, but for the
    pantographic punch cut era 1885-1970 roughly it''s the drawings that tell most
    of the story.  '

    This includes the largest collection of Bodoni material outside of Parma, Italy
