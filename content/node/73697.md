  body: Looks like you have started off modifying Gill Sans and its influence is showing.
    But I am not very sure if the x-height, weight and counters are ideal for a text
    font in small sizes. Some letters espacially lowercase y looks out of place.

  body: "I see where a couple Gill Sans features popped into the design in the lowercase
    d and q (they are now a little different in my latest revision). This was not
    intentional, and I certainly was not modifying an existing outline. I tweaked
    the x-height and lowercase y as per your suggestions. Thank you very much for
    the feedback!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/easysans2_6239.png]\r\n\r\nAttached
    is the latest revision.\r\n\r\nFor now, I will be adding glyphs and figuring out
    the whole kerning/metrics process. Any thoughts or suggestions would be welcome."
