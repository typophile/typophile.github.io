body: Is it possible to do the above? If you have a typeface, is there a script or
  trick to write all glyphs in one go (e.g. in Illustrator or another program). Would
  be very handy to test a typeface...

  body: You can print all glyphs from Fontlab, so I'm sure there must be a way to
    print to pdf then open that in Illustrator

  body: 'The problem is, that copy & paste might not work properly for glyphs without
    Unicode value. But the script I linked above uses the GlyphID, so it can access
    really any glyph inside the font. And between Adobe apps like Illustrator and
    InDesign you can easily copy & paste these glyphs. '
