  and/or alternatives. It's has to be different from the vere used \u2013 but great
  \u2013 Glypha, Serifa, Rockwell etc. \r\n\r\nSee it at: http://imgs.zinio.com/magimages/115942081/2007/221437591_toc1.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  like Enclave (http://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/sets/?CID=6) but I'm really not
  so mad about the new Soho that everyone seems to be raving about.  (http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/RecentReleases/2007/Soho.htm)\r\n\r\nThanks"

    (sometimes all you need is a family of 50 styles and you can grab press attention).
    Here is a better modern slab: <a href="http://www.christianschwartz.com/stag.shtml">Stag</a>,
    which could be the basis for the <em>Men''s Health</em> typeface.'

    the same line. http://typographica.org/art/articles/2006/GdnEgypSans.gif\r\n\r\nSo
    since it doesn't look like I can license this \u2013 then what do I use?"

    Contact us for more details.\"\r\n\r\nThere isn't much else in this realm other
    than what you mentioned. Maybe <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Zine%20Slab\">FF
    Zine Slab</a>, but that's heading another direction."

    You can ask Font Bureau about licensing.

  body: "Yeah that's it! Poplar. He makes some nice Slabs! \r\n\r\nI really like the
    extra bold version of FF Zine, but it really lacks a light version, and I think
    the regular feels too condensed. However, for this project I might just buy the
    extra bold or black version of FF Zine.\r\n\r\nI'm figuring that that's a lot
    cheaper than buying Poplar."

  body: "Some great suggestions from Stephen in this thread.\r\nPopular or FF Zine
    look like great options for you, Peter.\r\n\r\nRegarding Soho, which I designed,
    it has been pretty well received \r\nthankfully and people might want to check
    out the bigger pdf at \r\nhttp://www.monotype.co.uk/soho/ to make their own minds
    up.\r\n\r\nIt's a comprehensive pdf showing lots of text settings and \r\nstylistic
    alternatives for InDesign, if a particular letter \r\nor weight is not for you.\r\n\r\nIf
    some people just don't like the overall feel (refined industrial/\r\nmechanical)
    or whatever else, then there's not much I can do about \r\nthat and fair enough.
    I love that aesthetic myself."

    Soho for their recent redesign. It looks great for that kind of magazine and I'm
    sure that a top title like GQ will get Soho even more attentiton."
