    when seeing this was \u2013 freefont.\r\nGo Dafont \u2013 sans serif category
    \u2013 first font listed: Harabara."

    is Helvetica Bold, red is Harabara. I do not believe those points weren't stolen.

    they seem to be hoping to disguise their roots just by lopping off the top left-hand
    corner in a particularly unattractive way.\r\n\r\n"
