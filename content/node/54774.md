  playing with the gutter in my sketchbook did not turn out so well when it came time
  for me to scan it in. Usually we're told to stay away from the gutter, since your
  text and/or imagery can be lost, but I thought I'd explore it a bit with this collage
  assignment. I cut out another batch of C's and put them on the right side of my
  layout to mirror the first set of C's. I thought it would be interesting to have
  the little C's bubbling along the spreads' edges and to juxtapose the imagery popping
  out from the center. But I am quite annoyed with the black line that scars the middle
  of my collage, which is why I gave this blog its name..."

    sketches?"
