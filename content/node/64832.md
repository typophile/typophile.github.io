  body: "If you qualify for it, you should receive something in the mail. If you don't
    receive anything in the mail, you can contact/visit your local government employment
    office to see if you qualify. It is OK to work while on unemployment, you simply
    need to report your wages/earnings and let them figure out what you qualify for.
    Of course, the more you make, the less unemployment you will get.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if you were freelancing, your employer/client might not have been paying for unemployment
    benefits (in which case, you would have no claim)."

  body: "I'm not a lawyer but my understanding is:\r\n\r\nIf your \"employer\"* was
    withholding taxes and you were in-house and they controlled the hours you worked,
    paid you just for showing up (as opposed to for a particular project) and controlled
    how the work was done (among other things) then you were most likely an employee
    by the IRS definition, and probably qualify for unemployment. \r\n\r\nIf not,
    then maybe you were a freelancer by definition, maybe not. If the IRS classifies
    you as an employee but the employer didn't pay all the taxes and benefits (including
    unemployment) that they should have, the employer could face fines and penalties.
    \r\n\r\nThe IRS has good information on their website.\r\n\r\nMy take is (and
    this is only MY OPINION): if you really need the unemployment, contact your state
    labor board or the IRS to ask if you were an employee. (There is a form to file
    if you need to report the company.) If you prefer to keep the client relationship
    and can get by without unemployment, don't.\r\n\r\n*Employees have employers,
    freelancers have clients."

  body: " - it really depends on where you live as to the specific rules\r\n - being
    an independant contractor is usually a detriment in terms of qualifying for unemployment\r\n
    - \"We'll call you\", like in relationships, usually means \"it was fun, but we're
    not going see you again\"\r\n - good luck. It's a tough economy out there. I spent
    a greater portion of this year unemployed as well. The plus, however, was that
    I finally spent some time re-focusing and updating my portfolio (which was a way
    overdue task). \r\n "
