  body: "I think this looks more like Old West than a typewriter font, but tow things
    are not quite typical for the style: There is no serif on top of the A and there
    are full serifs on all corners of the N. The most similar font I could find was
    Sparky Type's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sparkytype/nisswa/plain/|Nisswa Plain]].
    You could add the serifs. The second two letters in your sample look like they
    were squooshed (tm).\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
