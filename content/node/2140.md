body: I&#39;m trying to design a logo for a weight loss clinic, and although i think
  the image is somewhat cliche, it gets the point across i don&#39;t know if this
  is the kind of thing that you would want to add humor too... <BR>

    &#40;or lack of cohesion&#41;. <BR>Something about the arrangement leaves me feeling
    like <BR>it could improved. <BR> <BR>Some things that you might consider: <BR>
    <BR>&#42; a weight change between Connecticut &#40;bold&#41; <BR>and Weight Loss
    Clinic &#40;reg&#41;, pun at random. <BR> <BR>&#42; all caps for Connecticut.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; maybe set the name underneath the state. <BR> <BR>&#42; why not
    try some sketches of some other ideas <BR>or other typefaces. <BR> <BR>also, it&#39;s
    4;30 a.m. so the typo on connecticut <BR>would be easy to overlook. <BR> <BR>good

  body: I think BJs concept of heavy and thin weights in the type is perfect. Lose
    the map and tape measure and create a clever typographical logo. As BJ suggested,
    work the type using bold and light. Maybe it&#39;s a progression &#40;or maybe
    more appropriately regression&#41; from Black to Heavy/Bold to Regular/Roman to
    Thin/Light, etc. Maybe the distinction is within the letters of &#34;Connecticut&#34;
    or maybe it is made from word to word. Or maybe the effect is only present in
    the words &#34;Weight Loss&#34;. Try it and see what you come up with. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: Scott, the Illustration bothered me too, but I couldn&#39;t put my finger
    on it. Having the name Connecticut in the name there is no reason to show the
    state outline, and the tape measure is clich

  body: 'Lund, I have to agree with Scott &amp; bj. It might be better to develop
    a pure typographic logo.  <BR> <BR>Even if you insist to use a pictorial elements,
    than they probably should be more logo-like. &#40;There is a functional point
    as well: imagine this photo on a fax or photocopy&#41;. <BR> <BR>Maybe you should
    also try to make the type more compact. Right now it seems that those letters
    have just been typed, not really &#34;designed&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Maybe the feeling
    of this logo is too &#34;Clinic&#34; and not enough &#34;Weight Loss&#34;. Honestly,
    it is not just about health, is it?'
