  a font recognition site.  I've also tried searching manually.\r\n\r\nThe key factors
  I was using to try and identify this font are the slight right slant, extended crossing
  to the lowercase 't', and how the 'n' is written with spaced out \"humps\".\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appriciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Will\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font3b_4557.JPG]"
