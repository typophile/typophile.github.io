  body: "Probably by an actual typewriter. Faux typewriter sans fonts are fairly rare.
    \ Earmarks for this one are i with a lower serif, two story a, and single story
    g. Very short descenders & ascenders. Wide lowercase  letter forms.\r\nNot a perfect
    match, but a very well executed font. Atlas Typewriter, http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/atlas-typewriter/
    and https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/atlas/typewriter If you want a distressed
    match then some digging of \"free\" fonts might be your best bet. Myfonts did
    not have a match, clean or dirty.\r\nDon"
