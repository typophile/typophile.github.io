    while, but for some reason didn't allow me to do it straight away. i already downloaded
    the new version, but haven't had a chance to install it yet.\r\n\r\nMy version
    (1.0.1. Build 1A029) has given me some grief with some fonts that previously worked
    well under Suitcase, but I'm managing somehow."

    I haven't given it a real workout yet.

  body: "Chris,\r\nI just saw one in the Central Park (more like a big forest really)
    here in Helsinki last week. It was crossing the path deep in the forest. The Central
    Park is a nice big strip of forest that stretches from the country side all the
    way nearly to the centre of Helsinki, and consequently we get elks running about
    in the centre occasionally...\r\n\r\nI'm rather fond of the salamanders. One of
    the best places I've spotted them was near the lake Como in Italy. There was a
    huge amount of them climbing on the side of the mountain and walls. I remember
    seeing a lot of them as a kid at a summer cottage in the Northern Finland, too."
