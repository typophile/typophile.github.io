body: "Hey there, Im in the process of building a portfolio site and identity for
  my design (mostly web) services. Its called \"number eight wired\" based on the
  New Zealand phrase \"Number Eight Wire\". (Im based in the UK though)\r\n\"Number
  Eight Wire is a metaphor for Kiwi ingenuity and enterprise: the ability to achieve
  or build anything out of a piece of number eight wire\"\r\n\r\nSo this is where
  Im at, Im not sure why i have arrived at this point, but Im mostly happy with it
  and am looking for some typographic critique, (not so much conceptual critique).
  \r\nThe N and W are built from Didot and the 8 is based off stencil forms (P22 Albers)
  because that was the only style of 8 that I could match with the stencilish/rectalinear
  nature of the N and W. (the Didot 8 wasnt working at all)\r\n\r\nTheres something
  happening with the 8 when i first look at it that make it feel like its actually
  the negative space of an eight????\r\ncant decide if this is good or bad or if this
  can be worked off.\r\n\r\nthe small text below it is set in Whitney SemiBold SmallCaps
  , which Im currently using sitewide as body text (Im an big HTF fan)\r\n\r\nthanks
  for any comments in advance,\r\ng\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/n8w_3447.jpg]"

  body: "I really like it when names have meaning. This one is especially interesting.
    \r\n\r\nI realize you are aligning the name with the mark, but I personally find
    it too close and in need of aligning with the full width of the mark, or in other
    words, align with the full W.  I think the 8 is a bit too close to the N as well..OR...the
    8 is too far from the W."

  body: "I made a few small adjustments...\r\nI think if the base text goes too much
    further out it \"hangs\" too much... I do like it further out though, kinda lines
    up with the angles of the W.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n8w2_6522.jpg]"

  body: "Great name/concept! \r\n\r\nI like the new weight of the \"base text.\" I
    think the 8 needs attention. \r\n\r\nSuggestions: \r\n-Try increasing 8's size,
    giving it as much importance as the N and W.\r\n-Adjust the shape of 8, making
    it longer, as to match the heights of N and W. \r\n-Shrinking 8 and centering
    it (without it looking like N&W)"

  body: "thanks Keena, \r\nyea more balanced i think, I just thought it fit a little
    more snug the other way:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n8w3_6294.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
    one spaced a little looser:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n8w4_3456.jpg]"

  body: Really nice -- I reckon you've nailed it. Latest versions maybe a bit dark
    for the web, but with a gold/metallic or something in print, it would look awesome.
    Great job.

  body: "thanks Jim I think Im finally happy with it also, Ive been getting that problem
    where you look at something too much and you lose your point of view...\r\n\r\nthe
    colour was going wrong somewhere between doing screen grabs in illustrator then
    moving to photoshop. The final output is a bit lighter.\r\n\r\n\r\nheres a (very
    close to completed) beta of the website if anyones interested: www.n8w.co.uk/beta.html\r\n\r\nI
    need to update the work in there as I have stuff in there from design school which
    Im not so proud of anymore..."
