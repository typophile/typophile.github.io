    but I can't seem to find an exact match.

  body: I think we're looking at <em>two</em> fonts here, and that's why it's confusing.
    Possibly the original designers swapped in a 'g' from Neuzeit or Avenir to combine
    with the other characters from Futura or Avant Garde.

  body: "Do you know where this sample came from?\r\n\r\nIt could be another Herb
    Lubalin - let's make a few changes to Avant Garde and call it a logo. As he did
    with mixing 3 typefaces for Bloomingdales... and the forerunner of Avant Garde
    - L&C Hairline...\r\n\r\nAnd Ben - you photo intrigues me -- \r\nare you familiar
    with Berkley Books? They use to have a Berkley Crime imprint back in the early
    1990s. I remember David Bamford struggling over the logo for the book. What came
    up is basically your moniker..."

  body: Geometric 706 is Bitstream's version of Neuzeit Grotesk (although the descender
    on the g seems to hug closer to the body in 706 as in the sample), looks like
    a match to me, but might help if the sample had more letters.

  body: Now that I look more I see the Gs in 706 and the sample are slightly different

  body: "I wonder if it could be Michael Neugebauer's Litera. I actually cut the first
    font of Litera back in 1977, following Michael's design. In those days done completely
    by hand in Rubylith, of course. Litera was commissioned by a well-known Salzburg
    architect named Garstenauer. Later on Michael developed it in several weights
    and as I remember sold it to Letraset, who had also published his Cirkulus and
    Squire designs. (Could be wrong, though.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, have a gander at this
    and see what you think:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/litera-sb/\r\n\r\nI
    still have the Ulano swivel knife and Rotring compass that I used to make that
    type face, although they have seen precious little use in the last twenty-five
    years . . . "
