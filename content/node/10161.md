  body: This is a nice idea. It&#39;s interesting that arrows are being used as both
    negative and positive shapes. But I think you need to consider working on consistency.  <BR>
    <BR>Some letters seem to have angular serifs, while some have squared serifs.
    Also, the use of the arrows needs to be considered. Some have arrows coming from
    the black, positive areas while others do not. Like, the &#34;E&#34; for example
    does not have an black arrow while the &#34;B&#34; does. Maybe these forms only
    need the negative or only need the positive arrows, perhaps not both.   <BR> <BR>Also,
    the width of the negative white arrows needs attention. Some are wider than others.
    <BR> <BR>Again, good ideas, it just needs a little more work and constant use
    of the shapes.

  body: 'I like the new direction. I also like how in some of your numbers the arrows
    follow the shape: like the 3, 5, &amp; 8. I&#39;d kinda like to see that maybe
    in your letters. Like the arrow could bounce inside the &#34;M&#34; or &#34;Z.&#34;
    Overall great job.'
