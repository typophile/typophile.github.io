  body: "Thanx for the folio comment Stephen :)\r\n\r\nYeah, I know I could contact
    the designer. I just think this should be \u201Eright\u201C from the start, I
    mean, it's difficult enought to get clients to buy fonts so extra cost for the
    eth's would not help us a lot hehe :)\r\n\r\nI know that it's tough character
    that not to many people use and know. I think it's only here in Iceland and Faroe
    Islands. \r\nI've gotten into debates with typedesigners (no names) that insist
    that theyr eth is perfect and in line with the rest of the font.. That's all good
    but when we that use these characters see that it dosn't look right, we don't
    use it. It's just looks and feels wrong.\r\nThere is maybe not a 100% right way
    to draw tham but we see when its done wrong. \r\nSo far this guide from Briem
    is the best guides on eth-drawings I've come across: \r\nhttp://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/2.1.4.eth.htm
    \r\n\r\nI know that Chester (vllg) looked into this guide for Galaxie Polaris
    and Apex New and them font's are quite popular here in Iceland :) Lovely eth's.

  body: "AnalogS, I'm sorry for this 'eth'. I understand why it's not clear. The 'eth'
    in ff Sanuk is probably better. \r\n\r\nWhen we design a face, we make glyphes
    for unknown languages and sometimes, we don't know if the shape is legible or
    weird. In french, we use a lot of diacritics such as acute, grave, circumflex...
    and I think numerous american fonts got approximatives accented vowels.\r\n\r\nSo,
    I'm going to read your guide to improve my next eth, thorn..."

  body: "Yeah. No worries. \r\nI totally understand your dilemma. :) \r\nIt's such
    a small character for other but for us it's quite big and important as it's used
    in just about every other word or so..\r\n\r\nHope this guide will shed some light
    on this eth nonsense :)\r\nI know that there is a new guide in the making Hopefully
    it will be online soon.\r\n\r\nXA, feel free to contact me if you'd like some
    feedback regarding this.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nOscar Bjarna\r\nhttp://analog.sys.is"
