body: I am currently working on a thesis project based upon the interrobang. The project
  revolves around re-introducing the interrobang back into our vernacular. I am having
  issues with finding plentiful information on this subject. If anyone has any information
  about the interrobang or any tid bits of facts. <BR>Some of the questions that I
  am trying to answers are fairly simple. <BR> <BR>Why has the interrobang been included
  in only times new roman as part of the international character palette if it is
  copyrighted, when this is one of the most common typefaces distributed world wide?
  <BR> <BR>How come this quirky piece of punctuation has been over looked by most
  designers? <BR> <BR>How have we forgotten something that is essential to those wonderful
  rhetorical questions? <BR> <BR>So if any one has any ideas or opinions about the
  interrobang i&#39;d like to here what everyone has to say.

    because the client requested it. My approach to the design was, I believe, novel,
    but basically this symbol is utter crap: it was poorly thought out, and it is
    basically impossible to design an interrobang that does not turn into a dark blot
    at small sizes. The construction of the symbol is illogical and counter to the
    organic evolution of written forms. <BR> <BR>The interrobang is not essential
    to rhetorical questions&#39;. It is a grammatically nonsensical mark, of possible
    interest only to someone who doesn&#39;t know the difference between a question
    and an exclamation. A rhetorical question is still a question, and should be terminated
    with a question mark. An exclamation is a statement that begins with an interrogative
    &#40;typically what or how&#41; but does not take the form of a question. The
    interrobang? How foolish!'

    first new puctuation mark to have been introduced in three hundred years and the
    only one invented by an American, is also featured in Americana. The interrobang,
    combining exclamation and question marks, was originated in 1962 by Martin K.
    Speckter, New York advertising executive and printing hobbyist. It was incorporated
    into all versions of Americana &#40;ATF calling it &#39;interabang&#39;&#41;,

    its ungainly form, but its grammatical nonsense. It is a &#39;punctuation mark&#39;
    for people who don&#39;t know how to correctly punctuate. It is entirely telling
    that the English language persisted for hundreds of years without the need for
    such a sign, until some advertising executive -- a breed not known for their finely
    honed grammar -- came up with the idea. Meanwhile, professional copy editors continue
    to correct misuse of question mark and exclamation mark, because they know the
    difference between a question and an exclamation.

    you&#39;ll think I&#39;m less of a &#39;purist&#39; if I acknowledge that it is
    <i>ungrammatically</i> useful? Yes, it is useful to people who do not express
    themselves grammatically. But then so is <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> , and I don&#39;t consider that punctuation. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    afraid there is simply no argument to be made for the interrobang being grammatically
    useful, because grammar distinguishes a question from an exclamation and assigns
    a specific, individual punctuation mark to each. There is no ambiguous case in
    which one cannot determine whether something is a question or an exclamation.
    Most things that are concluded ?! are in fact questions, and should be concluded
    ?.  <BR> <BR>So what does ?! represent? What indeed! It might be the raised eyebrows
    when we question something we can scarcely believe. Or it might be the tone of
    indignation when we question what seems to us wrong. But neither of these are
    <i>grammatical.</i> They belong to a level of textual articulation above the grammatical.
    So, yes, one can say that the interrobang might be ungrammatically useful, or
    even extra-grammatically useful. But this is an argument against the notion of
    the interrobang as a new &#40;and proudly American&#41; <i>punctuation</i> mark.
    It may look like a punctuation mark, it may have hijacked two punctuation marks,
    but it functions as something other than and beyond a punctuation mark. <BR> <BR>The
    interrobang itself is a symptom of ungrammatical usage of the exclamation mark,
    especially beloved of ad-men like Martin Speckter, to express loudness. You know:
    loudness! Since, according to this usage, the exclamation mark can be added to
    <i>any</i> statement, regardless of whether it is grammatically an exclamation
    or not, it is assumed that it can be added to what is grammatically a question.
    Correct use of the exclamation mark is one of the least taught aspects of English
    grammar, even more poorly understood by most people than the semi-colon and apostrophe.'

  body: 'Grammar is the system by which a language operates. The system is extensible,
    but if something is <i>contrary</i> to what is already established in the system,
    it is unlikely to catch on. So people have been asking for years &#39;Why hasn&#39;t
    the interrobang caught on?&#39; And I&#39;m answering: because it is contrary
    to our system of grammar, which makes a clear distinction between a question and
    an exclamation. Language is complex, but it is anything but arbitrary: it is the
    strongest evidence we have of the intensely structured nature of the human brain.
    Yes, languages develop, but they develop along specific lines. Capricious inventions
    by advertising executives are ever unlikely to catch on. The really remarkable
    thing about the interrobang is not that it didn&#39;t catch on -- that should
    have been predictable --, but that all these years later people are still asking
    why it didn&#39;t catch on. <BR> <BR>Changes in pronunciation -- which may be
    based on error or confusion, as in your &#39;expresso&#39; example -- have nothing
    to do with grammar. Pronunciation is conventional and essentially arbitrary. Grammar
    is systematic. <BR> <BR>Here is a more precise analogy. Millions of people use
    semicolons incorrectly; this does not mean that we are developing new usages for
    the semi-colon. There is one grammatical construction -- one grammatical circumstance
    -- in which we need a punctuation mark that does what the semicolon does. Any
    other use of the semicolon is simply pointless: a use of the mark where a different
    mark is appropriate. The same is true of the interrobang. In every situation where
    one might be tempted to use an interrobang, there is another mark -- usually a
    question mark -- that is intended to be used in that circumstance.'

    the same thing. <BR> <BR>The semicolon has fallen out of widespread use simply
    because it is not taught. People don&#39;t know how to use it, so they avoid it.
    But everyone I&#39;ve met who does know how to use a semicolon does use it. Not
    surprisingly, a knowledge of grammar extends the ways in which you can express
    your ideas. This used to be taught; indeed, grammar and rhetoric are the foundation
    of classical education. It isn&#39;t about rules: it&#39;s about tools.'

  body: Does grammar affect our ability to successfully communicate our thoughts?
    Can we think ?! without having a symbol &#40;or multiple symbols combined&#41;
    to express it? The Whorfian Hypothesis suggests that language shapes our understanding
    of the world. If we don&#39;t have language to describe an emotion or a state
    of being, then that emotion or state of being doesn&#39;t exist. <BR>whoa...my
    head hurts... <BR> <BR>If the use of the semi-colon &#40;or lack of it&#41; has
    to do with grammar education &#40;or lack of it&#41;, then access to the interrobang
    &#40;or lack of it&#41; also limits the possibility of its use. Is it possible
    that the semicolon is no longer being taught simply because it holds less and
    less of an important function in our language? I&#39;d argue that language and
    grammar work in a social/politcal-darwinian sense. What sticks around &#40;and
    who decides to keep it around&#41; remains functionable; what develops is based
    on the needs &#40;and those that hold the power&#41; of the language.  <BR> <BR>We
    can compare the interrobang to the evolution of the <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> or the <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0>, the emo-cons. Emo-cons are incorporated into interactive
    programs in order to address the needs of users by expressing specific emotions
    in their online conversations. What if...the interrobang worked like an emo-con
    or an Open Type ligature, where typing ?! would automatically change into an interrobang?
    How would users react?  <BR> <BR>hmmmm.......

  body: '<i>We can compare the interrobang to the evolution of the :-&#41; or the
    :-&#40;, the emo-cons.</i> <BR> <BR>Indeed. That is exactly what we can compare
    it to. I believe the interrobang <i>is</i> what we would now call an emoticon
    &#40;I&#39;m not familiar with the variant emo-con&#41;. That is, it is an extra-grammatical
    sign that provides a cue to emotive articulation of text. This is exactly the
    point I made earlier when I acknowledged that there is an <i>ungrammatical</i>
    use for the interrobang. What I object to is the oft-repeated statement that the
    interrobang is a <i>punctuation</i> mark. It seems to me that this is an assumption
    based solely on the fact that it looks like a punctuation mark, rather than on
    any attempt to analyse the use of the mark. Punctuation marks are a class of signs
    that correspond to the division of utterances into phrases and into classes &#40;statement,
    question, exclamation, etc.&#41; that are products of syntax and morphology. This
    division is grammar, and it is something that happens at a much lower level of
    language than emotive articulation. Some punctuation marks, especially the question
    mark, are particularly useful because of our habit of abbreviation, which can
    make syntactical constructions ambiguous. So, for example, if someone tells us
    &#39;Dinner will be ready soon&#39; we might abbreviate the question &#39;How
    soon will dinner be ready?&#39; to simply &#39;How soon?&#39; In this case, the
    syntax of the utterance &#39;How soon&#39; doesn&#39;t clearly indicate that this
    is a question, so the punctuation mark which performs only a supporting role to
    the full construction &#39;How soon will dinner be ready&#39; becomes essential
    to understanding. This is the sort of thing that punctuation marks do. They do
    not signal emotional articulation. They belong to a different class of signs from
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>
    and <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0>
    etc.. So I maintain that the interrobang is not a punctuation mark and has no
    grammatical function, because its purpose is to articulate something extra-grammatical,
    e.g. questioning suprise or disbelief. <BR> <BR>I think it is very telling that
    of all the many writing systems in the world, none have developed a primary system
    of emotive articulation, while almost all have developed or adopted some level
    of punctuation &#40;beginning with a space or marker to separate words or, in
    the case of written languages like Thai and Burmese, phrases&#41;. But there are
    many <i>secondary</i> systems of emotive articulation, which are not grammatical
    but are used by specific communities as a layer on top of grammar. The point about
    specific communities is very important in this regard because, while all symbols
    are conventional, punctuation marks correspond to describable aspects of the structure
    of language, while things like emoticons correspond to extra-linguistic, social
    conventions and are often identifiers of specific groups or &#39;tribes&#39;.
    The systems of secondary articulation of writing employed by Japanese schoolgirls
    are only partly intuitively understandable by readers outside that community.
    The system of emoticons employed on Typophile and many other forums, along with
    their plain text equivalents, are understood by a much larger and more international
    community, but this does not make them primary signs of any written language.
    They remain a level above grammar. They are also much more subject to fashion
    than punctuation, since they are primarily used in ephemeral utterances, while
    more formal written language is intended to communicate not only among a members
    of a particular community at a particular time, but between writers and readers
    from different communities living hundreds of years apart from each other. Secondary
    systems seldom last that long, while punctuation tends to evolve only very slowly
    and, once a language has developed a consistent system that works, it is more
    likely to solidify than to change. <BR> <BR>An interesting case of secondary articulation
    is the non-vowel markings of the Hebrew Bible. Some of these secondary marks --
    accent or cantillation marks -- have continued to be understood, or at least systematically
    interpreted within specific communities, for many centuries because of their musical
    significance. But there are some secondary marks in ancient Hebrew manuscripts,
    the puncta extraordinaria for instance, whose original meaning is lost and which
    we can only guess at. Hundreds of years from now, scholars might look at the handwritten
    notes of Japanese schoolgirls from the early years of the 21st century and ponder
    what the little hearts and cat faces meant to that community. The same researchers
    will be able to determine what the punctuation marks in the documents mean by
    analysing the structures of the language and how these marks relate to them. This
    is the difference between primary &#40;grammatical&#41; and secondary &#40;extra-grammatical&#41;
    notation of language: the former is tied to the structures of language, while
    the latter applied like a layer and can be easily disassociated. <BR> <BR>So what
    is the interrobang? It looks like a primary mark, because it references the form
    of two primary marks. But one of those two marks, the exclamation mark, is itself
    used by many people as an emotive articulation sign! &#40;as I just did there,
    for emphasis, even though grammatically that was not an exclamation&#41;. Indeed,
    this <i>secondary use</i> of the exclamation mark is much more common today than
    its primary use as a punctuation mark properly understood. So the interrobang
    hijacks this secondary, emotive articulating use of the exclamation mark and marries
    it to the question mark, which is still primarily a punctuation mark and only
    seldom used in a secondary way &#40;usually in isolation, as a kind of abbreviation&#41;.
    So it is neither one thing nor the other, but relies for what functionality it
    does have on a secondary use of the exclamation mark, and there seems to be general
    agreement throughout this thread that it is used to express something about the
    <i>way</i> a question is asked, which indicates to me that it is a kind of emoticon.
    Typically for a secondary mark, it has been subject to fashion. It was briefly
    in fashion in the 1970s, and one could pay to have one&#39;s typewriter modified
    to include it. It may come back into fashion. But it will never be a punctuation
    mark because there is no grammatical construct with which it is associated, which
    is the defining characteristic of all other punctuation marks. It tells us something
    extra-grammatical about an utterance, but even this is doesn&#39;t seem to do
    very clearly or well, especially if you care about a distinction between ?! and
    !? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
