  body: "Well, I just hunted through Parts 11, 12 and 14 of the Script Font ID Guide,
    and found nothing to match it. That tells me it's probably not a widely available
    font, but I know there are plenty of hand-lettered fonts I cannot have collected.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem, as usual, is that this font is hand-printed lettering, which can be made
    so easily and cheaply that this may be a custom font. Or it might be one of thousands
    of home-made fonts that are free all over the Web. (Although the lettering forms
    suggest the hand of a professional to me.)\r\n\r\nIn any case, my closest resemblance
    suggestion is Fonthead's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fonthead/samurai/\">Samurai</a>.\r\n\r\n-

    that for this logo it seems inappropriate. \r\n\r\nThe closest I found was <a
