  body: 'I quite like this concept, altough there&#39;s some issues with the way its
    working technically. <BR> <BR>There are a few characters in the lower case that
    could use tweaking: <BR> <BR>&#34;m&#34; i like, but consider splitting the two
    strokes that make it up &#40;the &#34;r&#34; like shape and the other curve&#41;
    and spacing them a little. At the moment the two are so close we almost lose the
    mid-stem all togther - it&#39;s losing it&#39;s &#34;m&#34;iness. <BR> <BR>&#34;t&#34;
    not working yet. try some other solutions, like the reverse J look -  if you know
    what i mean. &#40;sorry don&#39;t have time to mock-up visual samples&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>&#34;q&#34; seems that the stalk is too short. &#34;w&#34; seems too flat
    and the mid-stem needs to come up higher. <BR> <BR>In the uppercase the C, E,
    F, J, P &amp; R are all significantly skinnier than the other glyphs. I guess
    this was intentional, any reason why these characters? <BR> <BR>Solid effort overall.
    Forgive me everyone for getting my type-anatomy wrong. It&#39;s too late and I&#39;m
    too tired to whip out Bringhurst&#39;s Elements to cross-reference. Please, give
    me some feedback in turn on my sans-serif. <BR> <BR>Cheers.'

  body: 'I agree with Linus.  <BR> <BR>The font looks great when you spell your name
    out in it. Those characters looks good together. For now I will assume that that
    is the flow you want to achive with the rest of the font. <BR> <BR>I would add
    some suggestions.  <BR> <BR>Use more space between the letters so we can see them
    better. They seem squished together in the sample.  <BR> <BR>Caps: Maybe pull
    the ends of the cap C around further fallowing the path of the cap O. The D is
    overly wide. Why not drop the foot of Cap J down below the baseline? The Cap K
    seems like an H. A small adjustment could make a big difference. The cap M seems
    a little wider than it needs to be. Again small change is what I suggest. What
    about Pulling the foot of the R out from the stem farther? Or a Bigger counter
    for both the P &amp; R? Not both probably. How about a straight vertical tail
    on the Q? The W needs work. I can imagine 4-5 ways to change it. The Z is a little
    regular compared to the other interesting letters. Maybe treat it a bit more like
    the S? <BR> <BR>Lowercase: The e needs work. It stands out &amp; doesn&#39;t flow.
    it&#39;s an important character so I would do lots of versions until you get one
    that flows. I like the a. I thing the f most be taller. Otherwise it is a mixed
    lowercase small cap thing which is too wonky for the cool spacy elegance of the
    Caps. I really like the ghij. Same for the k as the f. What about a double mid
    stem for the m? Like two overnapped &#39;n&#39;s? Maybe too wacky also. Just a
    smooth double hump might be good... I think the q needs a decending tail. The
    s feels cluncky to me. Whay not adopt the approach of the elegant Cap S? As Linus
    said the t needs reworking. I would try several ideas &amp; see which ones feel
    closer to the feeling of the caps. Not that they should use the shapes of the
    caps - just the feeling. The w also needs reworking. <BR> <BR>Sweet font!'
