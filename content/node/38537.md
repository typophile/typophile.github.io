  Michael C. Place from Build (ex. Designer Republic) joins with Electric Picnic highlights
  Alan Clarke and David Holmes' graphic collaborator Glenn Leyburn for an extraspecial
  event in Limerick's Trinity Rooms... Free Mickey Finn cocktail reception for early
  arrivers, there'll also be prints too so hopefully see you there. Many thanks to
  Eamon Spelman for helping make this happen...\r\n\r\nhttp://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g124/CandyCulture/SweetTalk30.jpg\r\n\r\nFor
  those of you closer to Dublin don't forget the Design Week special which sees Alan
  again alongside local up-and-coming photographer Richard Gilligan and the UK's finest
  Adrian Shaughnessy (ex. Intro and writer of 'How to be a graphic designer without
  losing your soul') and Amos Toys (James Jarvis and Russell Waterman). Again there'll
  be many cocktails and prints and hopefully it'll be a great end to the Dublin programming
  for 2007... Many thanks to everyone for their continued support... Rockit...\r\n\r\nhttp://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g124/CandyCulture/SweetTalk29.jpg\r\n\r\nKeep
  well, have a great long weekend.\r\n\r\nRichard / CandyCollective.\r\n\r\nSign up
  to our Facebook event list here for more updates. http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5540422633\r\nThanks."
