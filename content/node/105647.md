  in a design I've inherited and have to turn a digital publication around quite quickly.
  Currently it uses a combination of Meta Serif for body and both Gotham and Whitney
  for box outs and folios.\r\n\r\nDo people think the Stag/Meta combination work?
  and do you think Whitney or Gotham should be the preferred sans??\r\n\r\nThink it's
  a case of 'can't see the wood for the trees' - can't see objectively on this...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"
