  body: 'I think the combination of strong &#34;piecemeal&#34; stems &amp; curves
    and wedge serifs is cool. The vertical proportions are great for a text face,
    but since this is more of a display face &#40;at least the weight you&#39;re showing
    here&#41; you might make the ascenders a bit shorter. <BR> <BR>As for the glyphs,
    they all make sense to me so far, so I&#39;d say make the rest and see how it
    goes. The two things I&#39;d note right now are: the foot serif on the &#34;r&#34;
    should be longer; and the curve-ear join on the &#34;g&#34; needs modeling to
    relieve the clotting &#40;like you already have with the &#34;n&#34;&#41;. <BR>

  body: Now that&#39;s more like it! lol. For a minute there I thought my font was
    so bad it didn&#39;t even warrant consideration. Thanks Hrant! I&#39;ll get to
    work on the other glyphs right away. Any more critique? bring it on! <BR> <BR>IM

  body: 'I think it&#39;s very intersting.  <BR>In my opinion there are interestin
    ideas, but I think you should correct the horizontal part of the curves: they
    are optically too much wide &#40;in my opinion&#41;. <BR>I think the upper part
    of e is too large. <BR>I think the upper part of your r is large too. When i look
    it from far, there is a hole beetween r and g.  <BR>The ascender is too high,
    even for a text typeface, in my opinion.'

  body: thanks luciano I will consider your input. even though this is not a text
