body: "Hello friends. I'm looking for an appropriate typeface to pair with Stratum:\r\n\r\nhttp://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/stratum-1-and-2/\r\n\r\nWe'll
  be using Stratum for headlines, most often in the bold weight, all-caps. Are there
  any typefaces that you'd recommend to be used for paragraph text alongside it? I
  haven't quite decided if we'd like to go serif or sans-serif with it, as I'd like
  to try out both. The overall tone we're going for is something modern, geometric,
  no-nonsense and direct. Thanks for any help!"

  body: I should also note that these typefaces will be used for a website design
    first, but then applied to print material later. It would be fantastic to find
    something that's been hinted for web use but that also works well for print.

    than I'm looking for, but I'll add it to the list.

  body: "I thought I'd ask Eric Olsen over at Process about any recommendations. Here's
    a nice response from him for anyone else that might be interested (hope he doesn't
    mind my posting it):\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"Since Stratum is so assertive, it does
    best in the lead role with other typefaces acting as support. I can't offer anything
    specific, pairing typefaces is extremely project specific, but the best pairings
    I've seen track in the opposite direction of Stratum. For instance, Metropolis
    magazine used Stratum for years with slab serifs and Bodoni. The latter pairing
    reveals a bias of mine as well - typographic contrast. Again being so assertive,
    it's best to contrast the loud voice of Stratum with something delicate. But,
    this also makes some assumptions about usage and size that are very project specific.\r\n\r\n\"All
    of that said, my best advice is to avoid something with implied geometry like
    Stratum because the resulting pair can be harsh. I'm always impressed by the pairing
    options designers can come up with - I've enclosed one below with fashion designer
    Paul Smith. I never would have suggested a hand drawn typeface with Stratum, but
    there it is!\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis is the Paul Smith pairing he's referring
    to: http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2016057/Paul_Smith_Giro_2013_Jerseys.jpg\r\n\r\nSo
    it looks like I'll be exploring some options that contrast it more\u2014less geometric
    and more delicate."
