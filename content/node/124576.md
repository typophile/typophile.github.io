body: "Similar to Mattel Intellivision font, and to Intellivised font family, but
  slimmer.\r\nA digital font should exist, I'm pretty sure this logo has not been
  built from the ground up.\r\nNot sure of this, but this could be a mix of capitals,
  minuscules and small caps.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/280_0_2887298_82718_4330.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
