      not a character that most typedeigners use daily so they tend to look at other
      typefaces and see how they 're made. So the \"error\" can go on for several
      typeface-generations :) I can understand that so no worry. It's good to be able
      to step in at this stage and give some pointers.\r\n\r\nThat can be very frustrating
      for us designers in Iceland. Buy a nice typeface then only to discover that
      the eth is all wrong. Thank god for them new online typetesters (the ones that
      work with Icelandic) so we can test these characters insted of only seeing some
      fixed pdfs that don't show our language.\r\n\r\nSo I've encouraged anyone that
      is in doubt with some eth's/Icelandic characters to contact me or any typeloving
      Icelandic designer that they might know for feedback.\r\n\r\nps. that text says

  body: "Chris, putting subtle ligatures (i_s, f_r, etc.) in a roman face is a massive
    idea.\r\nIt's kind of like going back to square one and reactualizing the relationship
    between the archetype of Poggio's <em>scrittura umanistica</em> and the formality
    of movable type -- with the opportunity afforded by the OpenType contextual alternates
    feature to retain a much greater degree of handwriting's connectivity, variety,
    and organic form. Of course, the utmost tact is required to hit the sweet spot
    between outright joined script and discreetly ligatured roman type, but you're
    well on the way. A more \"toney\", classic-looking face, with more contrast, would
    get more critical respect (I'm guessing the book weight will be that way), without
    the ggimmick and \"postcards\". But we love you man.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, cute
    'ol Froggy has retail potency, and should be published pronto!\r\nBut it's a dilemma,
    ennit, between the gimmick and the serious intent of the face as a full family
    with multiple language scripts. But perhaps a fun face can have all those proper
    features too. Why not? Benguiat's faces reflect his wit. (And watch out for Fontesque.otf!)\r\n\r\nOf
    all your designs, I would say this is the one with the most distinctly integrated
    personality, and should be the first you release. You've refined a few of the
    signature design themes you've explored in some other faces, so it has maturity.\r\n\r\nThis
    kind of semi-serif has not been a popular genre, in that it doesn't really fit
    into the conventional categories in which people use and combine type. Because
    of that, I suspect it's been a mistake when semi-serifs have been built on conventional
    architecture. However, it may well be that the Lozos v-form and the subtle OT
    ligaturing are what it takes to open up a whole nother dimension. \r\n"

    lot of work on Leporello etc., but IMO this face is in a different league (my
    taste can be a little quirky, but it's so nice to see an original design that's
    got a concept - the cool ligatures -- and some funky, original forms, amongst
    so much style-filter stuff). So sure release the others, but this one just seems
    like it could be really special, so I would agree with Tiffany to not sell it
    short. Damn it's a lot of work, yer OT typeface. But a 2-weight, 4-font family
    should be enough for a serif face."

  body: "Oliver, Chris tends to get a bit silly, so I was coming on pompous anti-silly
    with the artspeak rationale. I disagree with you on Froggy's originality. The
    letter forms, such as Chris' thing with the asymmetric diagonally stroked letters,
    have a lot of personality. Now that's not high-concept original, and semi-serifs
    are not a new invention, but I think you'll find that Chris' choice of where to
    put the serifs is unique and well-considered. As for the bunch of non-standard
    ligatures: well of course, that too is not original, Zuzana Licko and Jeremy Tankard
    have done that already, to name two recent designers. But the trick is to mix
    all that together in a subtle way, and I think Chris is getting there. Showing
    the bold first, and the gg gimmick, has undermined the import of this face somewhat,
    but hey, it's only Typophile!\r\n\r\nPoggio's writing style was the basis of the
    definitive roman types of Jenson.\r\nWhile the first types of Gutenburg were modeled
    on ecclesiastical blackletter script, in Italy, they modeled their types on the
    humanist script, and Poggio was the man.\r\n\r\nMetal type founders have experimented
    with all kind of ligaturing over the centuries, but it never really worked. I
    have the feeling that OpenType, with massive glyph sets and contextual alternates,
    is different, but so far that's only been exploited to any degree in scripts like
    Zapfino Pro, Caflisch, or in more novel faces like Ed Interlock. At some point,
    type designers are going to apply the effect subtly to roman type, making it more
    cursive like the model on which it was orignally based, the humanist script. So
    any indication of that, I'm fascinated. I would take a crack at it myself, but
    I'm backed up with concepts I haven't realized, and the subtly-ligatured roman
    type will have to wait a couple of years. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, go Chris!"

    The bent/sharp ended semi-serifs and the assymetical bent diagonals give this
    its unique friendly but crisp look. I think if Chris is able to give it a real
    evenness of color and polish, it has a chance at becoming, like these two, part
