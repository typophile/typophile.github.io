body: "I am trying to trace the history of the use of the term \"humanist sans serif.\"
  It seems pretty indisputable that Gill Sans is the first of this kind, but I have
  found that, though from early on Gill Sans is promoted as a sans of a different
  kind to the contemporary geometric sans-serifs from Germany, \"humanist\" doesn't
  seem to have been the word used to name this \"different kind.\" \r\n\r\nA companion
  question (which actually may go pretty far in helping to answer the first) is when
  was \"humanist\" first used to describe specifically ANY lettering (that is, seriffed
  types or script)? B. L. Ullman in 1960 still opines that humanistic script has been
  deplorably neglected in scholarship, but cites Morison's writings of the early 1940s
  as the \"leading treatment.\" Was \"humanist\" used in any of the turn-of-the-twentieth-century
  books? (I have Theodore Low De Vinne's 1900 Practice of Typography here and I don't
  see the term used.)\r\n\r\nSo: what's the earliest you've seen \"humanist\" used
  to refer to a sans-serif type?\r\n\r\nAnd what's the earliest you've seen \"humanist\"
  used to refer to any lettering?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can provide!"

  body: "\"Humanist\" is used to refer to a whole class of letterforms and calligraphic
    style from the 15th-century Italian Renaissance, which were based on 12th-century
    Carolingian style. Granted, this is writing/lettering and not type, per se.\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't be surprised if Johnston (Gill's teacher) were using the term in <cite>Writing
    & Illuminating, & Lettering,</cite> first published in 1906, though I'm sure that's
    not the first use of the term.\r\n\r\nD.B. Updike refers to the Humanist book
    hands in an early chapter of his seminal <cite>Printing Types</cite> (first published
    in 1922). But he doesn't use the term to refer directly to types. When discussing
    the influence of the Humanists on the first Italian types, he uses the term \"Humanistic
    influence.\"\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

  body: ">do you have other information?\r\n\r\nYes, Jaspert's Encyclopedia and also
    Mac McGrew's American Metal Typefaces says that the first foundry type version
    was done in 1922. They both say the Lanston Monotype version was done 1929-1930.
    \r\n\r\nBringhurst says that Goudy Sans is the \"spiritual father\" of \"several
    recent typefaces, including Erik Spiekermann's Meta and Officina.\" Perhaps Erik
    will chime in and let us know if Goudy sans was indeed an influence or inspiration.\r\n\r\nGoudy
    Sans has never been very popular, but I have a feeling that subsequent designers
    of humanist faces have been aware of it. I my guess is that it was path-breaking,
    though is not entirely successful as a design. \r\n\r\n "

    curves and (pen-angled) terminals in the lower case.\r\n\r\nBernhard Gothic, a
    type of similar vintage to Gill Sans, is far more chirographically informed in
    general.\r\nBut Gill's \"a\" and \"g\" really make a statement -- perhaps in contrast
    to the quite geometrically modern (or neoclassical) proportion of the rest of
    its letters.\r\n\r\nRound about 1980, when I was becoming familiar with type,
    there were only two \"humanist\" faces -- Gill and Syntax -- although I don't
    recall them being referred to as that. Even in the mid '80s, when I designed Shinn
    Sans, I thought of it as a calligraphic face, not humanist, and could only really
    add Eras and Shannon to the genre, and possibly Frutiger."

    didn't know what to make of Frutiger, it was transcendent, in a class of its own.
    What perplexed me most was the ease with which it could convincingly present the

    of his letters' use may have been pretty removed. Robin Kinross: \"Johnston's
    Arts & Crafts scruples and his natural diffidence obstructed any collaboration
    with the world of machine production: he never developed the alphabet as a typeface
    (i.e. in a range of sizes, with variant forms) for a typefounder, still less for
    machine composition.\" (<em>Modern Typography</em>, p75)\r\n\r\n"
