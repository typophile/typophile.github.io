  post</a> on the Logos Blog tells the story of creating a new TrueType font for Ugaritic.
  I thought folks on this forum might find it interesting, as it presented a nice
  challenge.\r\n\r\nA Semitic language written in cuneiform, Ugaritic was in use around
  1300 BC in the city of Ugarit in modern Syria. The city and its language was discovered
  by archaeologists in 1928. Ugarit literature bears some resemblance to parts of
  the Hebrew Bible, so it is studied by biblical scholars today.\r\n\r\nLogos Research
  Systems has undertaken to publish digital editions of a dozen Ugaritic texts and
  grammars. Since Ugaritic was originally written using a stylus on clay tablets,
  the font designer had to tackle some thorny questions, such as:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>How
  much do you try to emulate the tablets, and how much do you try to emulate later
  grammars? \r\n<li>What are the standard grammars, and how do they draw certain characters?
  \r\n<li>What shape should the wedges be? \r\n<li>How tall is each character? \r\n<li>Do
  they have a consistent baseline?</li></ul>\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, check out
  the <A href=\"http://blog.logos.com/archives/2006/10/all_in_a_days_work_making_an_u.html\">blog
  post</a> for details of how the font designer dealt with these obstacles and view
  some samples of the final product: Zebul Open."

    body: Glad you liked it. It will be pretty cool to be able to copy and paste Ugaritic
      text from these resources into other apps. Of course, we'll have a keyboard
      for typing it in directly, too.
