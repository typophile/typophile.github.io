body: Working with a clients logo but no one knows what font they used. Someone made
  it 1999 but that is pretty much all i know. I have found somewhat similiar fonts
  with blunt corners like the Fishmonger and Ketchupa Pro, but not this one in particular.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wiptext_logo_rgb_4489.png]

    ITC]] (by Erik Spiekermann and Ole Sch\xE4fer). The only difference is the shortened
    /i top serif."
