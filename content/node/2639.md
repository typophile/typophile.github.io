body: I picked up this amazing little book the other day. It explains how linguistics
  &#40;specifically the frequency of letters&#41; has affected Arabic &#42;calligraphy&#42;.
  It&#39;s in French, so it&#39;ll take me some time to read through, but it appears
  to derive some very interesting conclusions from some seriously quantitative analysis,
  although it&#39;s all tempered with a &#34;big picture&#34; approach. <BR> <BR>The
  author shows wonderful examples of calligraphic art, but couples them to statistical
  graphs! The type of dual-discipline thing you almost never see - highly fascinating.
  And it also contains some great data &#40;like a graph showing the relative letter
  usage of 7 Latinate languages&#41;, plus a killer bibliography. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://mywebpage.netscape.com/atanasiuvlad/frq/"
