  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I recently started work on a financial document that contains some interesting typographic situations. I&#39;m curious what your opinions are on methods for handling them, and whether there&#39;s an accepted way in these cases, or whether they&#39;re just judgement calls. <BR> <BR>Ex 1 <BR>I&#39;m using small caps for acronyms, such as NYSE and NAV, but there&#39;s a proper name which is written &#39;InvestPLUS&#39;. Now, assuming that the &#39;PLUS&#39; is an acronym at the end of a proper name, would you set the name with UC &amp; LC for &#39;Market&#39; and SC for &#39;PLUS&#39;, or would you leave &#39;PLUS&#39; in UC. &#40;I can hear Bringhurst groaning and mumbling about &#34;candy and drugs.&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>Ex 2 <BR>The proper name S&amp;P 500 set in body text. I used OsF to maintain the texture of the page, but is there a compelling argument to use LF to make S&amp;P 500 set more like a unit? Or is this more needless logogram-ery in typography? <BR> <BR>Ex 3 <BR>There&#39;s a term &#39;collateralized mortgage obligations&#39;, which is referred to as &#34;CMO&#34; in the copy. However, the writer pluralized the acronym at one point as &#34;CMOs&#34;. When setting a pluralized acronym, would you use a LC &#39;s&#39; or a SC &#39;s&#39;? I used a LC &#39;s&#39;, but it looks &#60;i&#62;very&#60;i&#62; close to the size of the SC letters in the acronym. Part of me thinks that the pluralizing is just incorrect writing. <BR> <BR>Ex 4 <BR>A bond can be rated with figures such as B, or B&#43; or Ba or Ba1. If you&#39;re setting the rating Ba1 in body text, would you use a LF for the 1 or the OsF? The issue is that the 1 next to the &#39;a&#39; becomes a bit confusing when it&#39;s an OsF, but the LF is, of course, more visually intrusive. Are there any rules for ratings? <BR> <BR>For the initial versions of the document I just made visual and cognitive judgements and then used them consistently, since &#40;I&#39;m told&#41; consistency in typography is more important that correctness used inconsistently. However, I&#39;d really prefer both. <BR> <BR>A related question: any recommendations for a style manual? The one I know of off the top of my head is <i><a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/cmosfaq.html">The Chicago Manual of Style</a></i>. Is this a safe bet? <BR> <BR>PS: The text face I&#39;m using is <a href="http://www.kentlew.com/Type.html">Whitman</a>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As a professional lawyer &#40;and typographic amateur&#41; I come across this sort of problem a lot. I don&#39;t think there is a &#34;right&#34; answer, but I&#39;ll give you my gut instinct, for what it is worth. <BR> <BR>1. InvestPLUS: use whatever looks least bad. How about the P large caps and the &#34;lus&#34; small caps? This really is a one-off decision. <BR> <BR>2. &#43; 4. If you are using OSF, use OSF consistently except in headlines with full caps. If S&amp;P is in small caps, then the OSF 500 will look fine anyway. Even if it isn&#39;t it will look OK. &#40;The problem with X&amp;Y acronyms is when there is not a small-caps height version of the ampersand, but Whitman is such a well-conceived face I bet it has one.&#41; No-one reading it will have any trouble with the OSF, I&#39;m sure. They will read S&amp;P 500 as a unit because they are familiar with it and for them it is obviously a unit. <BR> <BR>I would not, incidentally, put bond or security ratings B or BB&#43; and the like in small caps. I  <BR> <BR>3. Lowercase s definitely. The rule is: how would you set it if you were using large caps. The answer, surely is CMOs. You do the same with small caps. There is no justification for capitalizing the s under any circumstances. &#40;But the writer is at fault, surely if the acronym is plural to start with and then being pluralized again, i.e. if CMO = &#34;collaterlized mortgage obligationS&#34; to start with, it should never be CMOs.&#41; <BR> <BR>Where text has a mass of acronyms I find it often is hard to use small caps for them &#40;though I prefer them&#41;. As soon as an acronym starts a sentence one hits trouble. In those circumstances I find it generally less troublesome to use a font with a low cap-height anyway, rather than small caps. <BR> <BR>On style, I always liked Hart&#39;s Rules--the old little version not the bloated modern OUP style guide. But for US usage I think Chicago is probably the safest thing.</div>
