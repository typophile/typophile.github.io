  a semester here at RISD in Providence, and one of my classes is a typeface design
  class. It\u2019s taught by Cyrus Highsmith of Font Bureau. <BR> <BR>I stumbled upon
  this forum and was impressed by the wealth of knowledge and number of people I recognized
  &#40;Keith Tam teaches at my school, and I met J.F. Porchez. at last year\u2019s
  ATypI in Vancouver&#41;. I figured this was the right place to ask for some advice!
  <BR> <BR>My project and first typeface is a blend of sans-serif and blackletter.
  It\u2019s been tough going so far, but the general idea is to reclaim and simplify
  blackletter in a way that doesn\u2019t bring along negative connotations, and to
  add to the sans-serif some of the interesting features of blackletter type that
  add character and some might say legibility. To do this, I\u2019ve been trying to
  both add blackletter features to sans-serif structures as well as to simplify and
  modernize the blackletter. At the moment, I\u2019m somewhere in the muddy in-between\u2026
  <BR> <BR>Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially in terms of general
  direction or good blackletter typefaces to analyze or base this on. So far, Gotenburg
  B Bold, Deutsch Gotische, and Werbdeutsch Heavy have all seemed promising. <BR>
  <BR>I don&#39;t really want it to be a display type like Orbon, but my limited experience
  may require it to be so. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks very much for your time!"

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I do not have any good suggestions of reduced
    blackletters that you should look at, but I&#39;m sure that some of the other
    typophiles here can suggest a few. <BR> <BR>What you could do is look at a lot
    of cuts of German Type from the 1930s

  body: FWIW One of my early designs, ITC Orbon, was a stripping down of Blackletter
    into a san-serif form. I was watching a Blackletter calligraphy demonstration
    by Ward Dunham, and the idea for the design evolved from there.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.terminaldesign.com/retail.php?ID=3"

    <BR> <BR>And I agree with Dan &#40;although maybe more due to functional concerns
    than stylistic&#41;. Complexity is human and beautiful, and in this case it&#39;s
    what makes blackletter better than roman for readability: <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_fraktur1.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_fraktur1.html</a> <BR> <BR>What
    I would do is, yes, avoid the decorative aspect of blackletter, but only in terms
    of finish. In terms of <i>structure</i> &#40;especially in the ascenders and descenders&#41;
    I would leverage blackletter&#39;s wonderful divergence. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
