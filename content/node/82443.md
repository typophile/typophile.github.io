  her entire name in small caps (anywhere that it appears in writing) is part of her
  brand. This seems somehow 'off' to me, but maybe that's just me?\r\n\r\nThanks for
  weighing in!"

  body: The customer, as ignorant of the finer points of correct style as she may
    be, is always right. Similarly, matters of taste cannot be argued. If you like
    getting paid for your work, choose another battle to fight.

  body: "A brand is any consistent graphical treatment associated with a particular
    entity (whether an individual, company or product). So if your client has established
    or seeks to establish the use of smallcaps for her name as part of a brand, then
    of course it should be done consistently. Of course, brands can backfire, as when
    people come to habitually think \u2018Oh, yes, she's the pretentious one who sets
    her name in smallcaps all the time\u2019."

  body: "Quicksilver for OS X is like that. I've never had this problem, but I've
    always wondered if there might be software out there that doesn't recognize Unicode
    small caps as being the same as regular letters for querying purposes.\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    it's been popular in Asian countries for a long time to get specific about the
    way names and titles are written in branding and other pop culture contexts. And
    there's always e.e. cummings, AFKAP, etc. This doesn't seem that much weirder
    than those examples, but I would personally think twice before getting touchy
    about anything that makes it more difficult for other people to write my name
    \"properly.\""
