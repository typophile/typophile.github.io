  and part of my final submission task is to produce a little font booklet that would
  most accurately inform the reader/viewer about the font that you have been chosen
  to represent. I've been tasked with Times New Roman, be it luck or tragedy. \r\n\r\nPersonally
  i've found Times New Roman to be somewhat a difficult font to place/display in a
  booklet artistically & aesthetically pleasing ( although its known so ubiquitously
  as a book font ) .\r\n\r\nI've decided to divide the book into a few sections, as
  follows : Introduction ( 2 pages ), About the font ( 4 pages ), Variations [ bold,
  italics, etc ] ( 4 pages), Typographic posters ( 4 pages ) and lastly credits. \r\n\r\nIm
  a wit's end due to my lecturer failing my initial sketch/rough print by a single
  mark, and I desperately need to push my grades for this module up ( I hereby blame
  the lecturer ) and would anyone here be kind enough to suggest any ideas that I
  could add in?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if you would to know of any websites that would
  help me understand the font a little bit better, with visual help, please do drop
  a bit of knowledge!"
