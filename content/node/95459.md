    of Century Schoolbook or Century Expanded; this limits the usefulness of its results.\r\n\r\nI
    would also have been very interested to learn where Times Roman ranks in such
    a test.\r\n\r\nBefore looking at the article in the link, though, this reminded
    me of another famous saying... but though I read it in a book, on the web, it
    seems that Tamazight or French are more often given the title of the language
    of free men."

    Baskerville might not have seemed so truthful with a different typespec.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThese
    kind of \u201Cpriming\u201D tests (to use Kahneman\u2019s term) point in an interesting
    direction, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. As graphic designers, we
    work with the full range of typographically expressive means, and to suggest that
    merely choosing a particular font will have speci\uFB01c and predictable neurological
    effects is to banalize our profession."

  body: "The informal study was only among six typefaces, hardly enough variety to
    claim that Baskerville has a lock on projecting authority and credulity. Looking
    at the other faces: : Computer Modern, Georgia, Helvetica, Comic Sans and Trebuchet,
    what the outcome says to me is that tradition is seen to equal truth, i.e. the
    oldest typeface looked the most trustworthy. Let\u2019s see a contest among Baskerville,
    Caslon, Bodoni, Garamond and other pre-20th century faces and then see what happens.
    Let\u2019s change the content to something non-scientific (in this case it was
    an asteriod hitting Earth) and see what happens. Let's change the colour of the
    text, change the size, the leading, the column width, etc. etc. and see what happens.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

    test one\u2019s new type against some old rubbish (MS core Truetype web fonts
    would do in a pinch) in a layout which favors it, then proclaim that science proves
    that one\u2019s new design is the Best Ever."

  body: "Yes, he could have expanded the test, and I agree that different sizes of
    fonts might affect the results; Trebuchet looked nasty on my screen on the size
    used, but much better enlarged a bit. The results are still  interesting.\r\n\r\nSeeing
    that the fonts were rendered by browsers, I wonder if they could find differences
    in results based on the browser used. It might have been better to use images.
    I assume browsers present them more uniformly."
