body: "This is not a direct type ID, but I am hoping I can get some thoughts on an
  existing font that has similar properties.\r\n\r\nI'm working on an identity project
  for a local emerging fashion designer and after having done a cursory evaluation
  of her brand, I'm on the hunt for a font to pair with it. We are going for old Hollywood
  with a modern and fresh twist. Jessica Hische is one of my design idols and I happened
  across a [[http://jessicahische.is/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/magic-hours11.jpg|book
  cover]] she did and the look of it fits perfectly - if only she extrapolated this
  into a font!\r\n\r\nLooks retro\r\nStill very modern and fresh\r\nVery clean\r\nSlightly
  feminine\r\n\r\nPaired with the hand-drawn feel of the dot on the \"i\" along with
  the other illustrative details, it really puts this look spot on for what I'm looking
  for in a font.\r\n\r\nAs a starting point, can anyone think of a nice script font
  with a similar aesthetic? I'm open to non-script suggestions as well as long as
  it has that right mix of modern and retry. So far, I already own [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/almibar/?refby=tb|Almibar
  Pro]], but there's parts of it that I fear might be unusable. "

  body: Thanks, fvilanakis. Those do have an old school vibe. I'm hoping for something
    that has a fresher, more modern feel to it, though.
