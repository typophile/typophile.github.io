body: This image is of a record that my Dad's band made in the 60s. It's the only
  image I have -- sorry about the resolution. I'm recreating the album, and would
  like to know (mainly) what the main body font is for the title of the music. Any
  other fonts on the record would be helpful as well. The second image is a reference
  that's clearer, using the same font.

  body: PS -- it doesn't appear to be Avant Garde, Century Gothic, or Futura. But
    those seem to be in the ballpark...

  body: Indeed -- unfortunately not -- Tempo is a compressed face. This is more in
    the geometric sans family - notice the round Gs. The A and the N have "clipped"
    tips, so that narrows things down quite a bit. In terms of overall shape and weight,
    Century Gothic Bold seems quite close, minus the clipped tips.

  body: "Given the time period, my vote would go to good ol' Futura. There were many
    many variations as every typesetting company came up with their own version. \r\n\r\nFor
    the number 3 and Joker I would start at Bodoni italic."

  body: 'Pre-digital, Tempo was available in uncompressed widths - it was essentially
    one of the variations on Futura that vivicity mentions. There''s more info on
    it posted by Mark Simonson in some old Typophile threads like [[http://www.typophile.com/node/10490|this
    one]]. '

  body: "Could be. Why Twentieth Century over Futura? Where are the differences? There
    are so many Futura versions.\r\nThe tight spacing of \u2018ck\u2019 in Jackson
    possibly suggests a German origin, no? "

  body: Something about the 5 seems Twentieth Centuryish. Then again, the 2 might
    not have the Twentieth Century "overhang".

  body: I would say it's either Futura (if it was hand set), Twentieth Century (if
    it was set on a Monotype caster), or Spartan (if it was set on a Linotype). The
    latter two were near copies of Futura. The differences are small.
