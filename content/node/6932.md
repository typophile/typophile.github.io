    appropriate for firewood, but the execution looks dated to me

  body: Hello, <BR> <BR>Thanks for your views. The logo is to be used for letterheads,
    t-shirts, van advertising. We cut and sell firewood by the van load so we don&#39;t
    have packaging for each bag as such. I was going to keep the logo black and white
    because we are a small business just starting out and this was to try and keep
    costs down. Also I thought black and white is quite bold and distinctive and would
    be easier to see. I don&#39;t have any design background so I&#39;m not sure if
    my thinking is right or not. Not sure I want to have a 70&#39;s or 80&#39;s feel
    to my logo though. Maybe I should I get a logo designed for me as I want the image
    of the company to be proffesional even though we are doing a manual job which
    could be traditionally seen as something that is a bit rough and ready.

  body: '&#34;the&#34; white knockout on the F &#40;or overlay if you prefer&#41;
    pulls too much attention and breaks up the flow. Also move &#34;N&#34; <BR>towards
    &#34;Y&#34; this would make negative space more neutral.  <BR>Recut &#34;C&#34;
    so right side is straight.'

  body: It looks 70s/80s because of the heavy weight and the tight spacing. Try loosening
    it up a little, experiment with some lighter fonts. Also, geometric fonts like
    Futura can seem cold to many people... you&#39;re selling warmth, right? &#40;I&#39;m
    assuming you&#39;re selling the firewood to the consumer&#41; I don&#39;t know
    about what your customers are like, but I personally think of fireplaces and wood
    stoves as a rustic, homey pleasure, so it would make sense to convey that in the
    type. Try a more traditional &#40;i.e. centuries-old&#41; font, or one that has
    some suggestion of hand-cutting, or &#34;rough-hewn&#34; edges. Slab-serif fonts
    can convey the sense of the heavy lifting that you do. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/albertus/mt/testdrive.html?s=FIREWOOD+COMPANY&amp;p=48">Albertus
    </a> comes to mind as one appropriate font choice, if a bit obvious. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rockwell-mt-2/rockwell-extra-bold/testdrive.html?s=FIREWOOD+COMPANY&amp;p=36">Rockwell</a>
    is a good slab-serif. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rosewood/fill/testdrive.html?s=firewood+company&amp;p=48">Rosewood
    Fill</a> has an endearing irregular quality, although that might not be the look
    you&#39;re going for. <BR> <BR>And the logo looks very computer-drawn because
    the line weights are all the same. The double boxes don&#39;t help. Try a solid
    black square with the tree rings drawn more &#34;naturally,&#34; and reversed
    out in white. <BR> <BR>//john

  body: Im not sure about the logo mark; it looks like a generic logo for stereo equipment.
    As for the type, I can understand the boldness of it, but the san-serif, blockiness
    makes it hard to read. I think rockwell would also work. Try something like <a
    href="http://www.homedepot.com" target="_blank">www.homedepot.com</a>, varying
    the words and working in the &#34;the&#34; better into the logo.
