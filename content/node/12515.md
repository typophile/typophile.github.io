body: "I haven't been able to get any support out of Apple or Microsoft so I thought
  I'd try here.  I just upgraded to Tiger  (21 PowerMac G5s with 10.4.1) and now Word
  and other Office applications are reporting that I have a bad font during the \"Optimizing
  Font Menu Performance\" routine. The message actually comes from the operating system
  but is triggered by Office applications.  The system disables the font.  If I reinstall
  the font it works fine in all other applications until I run an Office application.
  \ This is a font I've used for 10 years (its a custom in-house font) from OS 7.1
  through 10.3.9 with all Office applications.  The font verifies correctly in Font
  Book and Font Doctor.  I\u2019ve deleted the Office preferences and cleared font
  caches.  It\u2019s happening on all computers running Tiger.  Any help or suggestions
  are appreciated.\r\n"

  body: Do you absolutely need the font in your Office apps? If you just need it in
    the Adobe CS suite, for example, you could put it in Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts,
    where InDesign, et al, can use it but apps like Entourage and Word won't know
    it's active.
