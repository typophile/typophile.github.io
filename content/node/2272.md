  body: I feel moved and enlighted. Is this what nirvana feels like? <BR> <BR>Seriously,
    Daniel. Once you get the spacing <BR>right this thing is ready to be sold to masses
    <BR>of Beardsley and beauty fans everywhere. <BR> <BR>Like what&#39;s up with
    the &#39;I&#39; &#39;J&#39;? Is that just <BR>so the &#39;I&#39; lines up with
    the &#39;W&#39; for the sample? <BR> <BR>Go ahead and slap this on a shirt for
    the  <BR>Typophile Tee Shirt Contest and win.

  body: very nice Daniel. I have seen a lot of designs going in this direction but
    somehow this looks more historical. I would perhaps try to modify the areas indicated.
    the S has one shorter <BR>stem. the short lines look a bit out of place with everything
    else in my opinion.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2161.jpg"

  body: 'Ok, ok. I&#39;m getting very giddy here at 4 a.m. <BR>thinking about the
    emense possibilities this <BR>font holds. For instance: <BR> <BR>1 - Consider
    making 3 seperate fonts, one as it <BR>is now, one with the heavy &#34;alphabetic&#34;
    lines, <BR>and one with the windy scroll lines. This would <BR>allow the designer
    to combine the fonts and color  <BR>the two elements seperately. Layering is hip.
    <BR> <BR>2 - Create another font in which the windy scroll <BR>lines extend out
    of the letters. Could also be <BR>another layerable font. <BR> <BR>3 - Create
    a bitmap version. You think I&#39;m kidding? <BR>Talk to this guy: <A HREF="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1944.html?"
    TARGET="_top">Miguel Hernandez</A>. He makes <BR>display fonts out of pixels.
    <BR> <BR>About the short lines... I&#39;m beginning to see why <BR>some work and
    some don&#39;t. On the &#39;M&#39; the lines <BR>are a continuation of the flow
    of the lines above <BR>it - they are just crossed by another pair. So <BR>I think
    they work on the &#39;M&#39; and &#39;R&#39;. On the &#39;Q&#39; <BR>and &#39;O&#39;
    they seem to be space fillers rather <BR>than continuations of the lines. This
    makes them <BR>distracting. You see? Or am I dillusional from <BR>lack of sleep?

  body: ' Daniel, you&#39;ve certainly captured that fin-de-siecle decadence of Beardsley
    and Wilde. It&#39;s also strangely reminiscent of some good ol&#39; Letraset stuff,
    ca. early 70s. <BR> <BR>One technical question: It&#39;s hard to tell exactly
    from just a screen rasterization, but did you build any overshoot into all those
    rounds? I can&#39;t see any in the samples, and it&#39;s disturbing the rhythm,
    to my eye. But maybe its just the low resolution of the gifs. '

  body: This <B>IS</B> amazing. And I completely agree with Stephen. I <B>WANT</B>
    to see this on the typophile t-shirt contest! <BR> <BR>Also, Stephen&#39;s idea
    about 3 separate fonts -- Did you mean this &#40;for my visual impairment&#41;
    to be similar to the woodcut fonts that have fills? <BR> <BR>Short lines -- because
    they only appear in such small amounts, this is perhaps why they don&#39;t quite
    jive with the rest &#40;?&#41; <BR> <BR>LOVE -- ABEFGIJNPTUVXY <BR>TWEAK -- C,
    go a little more traditional on the heavy stroke; D, not sure about the tiny little
    corner; H, not loopy enough; K, could the scrolling lines intertwine just as the
    heavy strokes &#40;?&#41;; L, too similar to the J; M, i see an R; O, short lines;
    Q, short lines; R, short lines; S, again a little more traditional on the darker
    stroke <BR>WORK -- MWZ all three are a little too wacky. <BR> <BR>but hey. this
    is amazing and maybe my boring old traditional eyes are wanting too much? as for
    the I &amp; J, what if there was a hanging alternate J ? by the way, i think the
    T rocks!

  body: ' Uh oh - Tiffany has become code happy. &#40;Those bolds!&#41; <BR> <BR>The
    3 fonts... <BR> <BR>Font A - The design as it exists. <BR>Font B - Contains only
    the thick lines - the forms of the letters. <BR>Font C - Contains only the curly,
    scroll lines. <BR> <BR>The idea is to allow the user to seperately <BR>control
    the color of each element. For instance: <BR>if there was a legibility concern,
    the user could <BR>make the alphabetic forms a slightly darker color <BR>than
    the inside ornamentation. The different fonts <BR>would allow this change much
    quicker than tedius <BR>editing in Illustrator. <BR> <BR>If there is room for
    expiramentation with the inside <BR>curls, there is an opportunity for two more
    fonts: <BR> <BR>Font D - Could contain alternate &#40;maybe longer&#41;, scroll
    lines. <BR>Font E - The full design with the alternate scroll lines. '
