  How do I access the characters in some of my fonts?  Usually when I try to use some
  kind of webdings-style font in PS I can't access the characters displayed in the
  font preview in (I use a mac) fontbook.  I've been told these are \"pi\" fonts or
  something and that I can use the International palette thingy to use these fonts
  but the ones I want don't show up in the list.  Can someone please help me here?"
