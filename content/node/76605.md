  body: "Claire, I suggest you ask your client some questions before you start designing
    the wine label. Here are some that came to my mind after a couple of glasses of
    wine:\r\n<li>Is this an expensive wine being marketed to connoisseurs, or an inexpensive
    wine aimed at impulse buyers?</li>\r\n<li>Will the wine be sold mainly in the
    region where it's made, or is it meant for export?</li>\r\n<li>Is the region where
    the wine is made part of the branding strategy? (Think of the kangaroo on the
    label of Yellow Tail wines from Australia.)</li>\r\n<li>Is there something unique
    about the wine that you want to communicate to buyers? (For example, \"Our grapes
    are organically grown\" or \"Our winery has been in the same family since 1810\").</li>\r\nThese
    questions will tell you who the audience is that you're trying to reach, and what
    message your client wants to send to them. Once you know those things, picking
    a font will be much easier."

  body: "Dear Victor,\r\n\r\nBelow you'll wind some background info.\r\n\r\n_One of
    the worlds oldest wines still produced.\r\n\r\n_Currently it's is mainly sold
    in the country of it's origin, with very little export to EU countries. The aim
    is to redesign it, so it's appealing to international markets. \r\n\r\n_It's targeted
    towards the average buyer, client wants it to look expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n*unfortunately
    I can't tell you everything. "
