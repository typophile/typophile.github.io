  overall collection, and I noticed that\u2014given the impact on my personal life\u2014the
  late sixties and early seventies are grossly underrepresented.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  have any suggestions on typefaces particularly evocative of that era? There are
  a number of typefaces in the PLINC library which are original or derivative, but
  House Industries hasn\u2019t gotten around to doing whatever they have to do to
  the source material before the letterforms can be used for their online headline
  service. But, I don\u2019t to step on any toes, so other sources would be appreciated."

    album covers shown are very evocative of the era you're talking about, aren't
    they?\r\nA couple examples that grabbed me: L&C Hairline designed by Herb Lubalin
    & Tom Carnase in 1966 \u2026 \r\nNovel Gothic designed by Morris Fuller Benton
    for ATF in 1928 (but looking so 1969 on that Miles Davis record)."

    line of swash alphabets\u2014based on Cooper, Barnum and Latin\u2014that were
    dynamite: bold, playful and in-yer-face. Very seventies, very cool..."

    because it strongly evokes "early 70s" to me. Much to my surprise, I just found
    it predates the 1970s by about half a century!
