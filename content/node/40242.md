body: "This font is very similar with Times New Roman, Times, Times Ten, Timeless,
  Nimbus, Newton.\r\n\r\nBut I believe none of them is match with above-mentioned
  fonts.\r\n\r\nFor a hint, look at small \u201Cv\u201D letter in Italic and compare
  them.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is available \"fi\" ligature on the font.\r\n\r\nI anyone
  can ID this font, I am very happy because I really like it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font

    characters... how old is this sample?\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    not Nimbus Roman in Italic.\r\n\r\nThe small \"v\" letter in Italic is different
    in shape."

  body: Did a quick search and the only font with "Times" in the name and this round
    'v' is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/times_europa_std_ot_virtual/">Times
    Europa</a>, which is a significantly different typeface overall.

  body: The kerning is very poor. Perhaps switched off?

    Gyre Schola]].\r\nIf not I guarantee you can find it somewhere on that site. In
    my experience, I have only ever seen LaTeX used for math and physics papers or
    books. "

  body: "As the site says, the LaTeX typeface is based on New Century Schoolbook,
    and this is definitely Times-New-Roman-based. However, the 'v' is closer to Century
    than Times (although still not exact).\r\n\r\nRe the 'fi' lig, some versions of
    Times New Roman do contain it.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
