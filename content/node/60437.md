body: "Take a look at this new card, designed by Dimitri Scheblanov ( dimitrischeblanov.com
  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted on Rives BFK 260gsm fine art paper (Arches Mill, France)
  with duotone offset litho for the watercolor wash, type is letterpress from photopolymer
  plates on the Heidelberg Windmill 10x15 (Red ball ca 1960)\r\n\r\nThe design is
  just gorgeous. I was concerned about the tiny type, but I'm always amazed by the
  polymer and the Heidelberg Windmill! \r\n\r\nThere will always some minor variation
  through the print run, as I'm constantly tweaking the press (roller height, ink
  load) to make the best possible impression.\r\n\r\nThe trick with this 'mouse' type
  is to get enough ink on it without losing the definition. You can see below that
  the  [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfraterdeus/3769451684/in/set-72157621758713049/|
  '-'s around 'BASTA SURF' are about three half-tone dots long!]]\r\n\r\nThe ink is
  a very fine litho black with a hint of green added, and stiffened with magnesium
  carbonate. \r\nThe \"mag\" is necessary to 'shorten' the ink. Litho ink is runny
  and would tend to blur the edges of the type. \"Short\" ink is stiffer, and sticks
  to the printing surface with slurring. Of course roller setting is absolutely critical
  in a job of this sort (well, any job really), since the extremely fine details will
  easily be slurred and mushed over by a low roller. The Heidelberg is the pinnacle
  of platen press evolution, and amongst other things, allows for extremely fine control
  over the roller height.\r\n\r\nAlso, a bit of business news:\r\nThanks to the credit
  crunch, we're facing a serious survival test. One of our banks is raising the minimum
  monthly payment from 2% to 5% of our total balance. That's 150% increase in the
  monthly payments. It's literally enough to sink us if something doesn't change,
  and fast!\r\nSo, please keep us in mind for exquisite letterpress printing. Our
  quality/price ratio is about as high as you'll find anywhere in the world these
  days ;-) \r\n\r\n\"Slow Print, High Touch!\"\r\nUse it or lose it ;-)\r\n\r\nBy
  the way, we've been extremely gratified by Typophile.com readers, who have regularly
  spiked the slowprint.com site to 300-400% of our normal daily traffic!\r\nThanks
  for your support and consideration!\r\n\r\nPeter Fraterdeus - peterf@\r\nslowprint.com\r\nsemiotx.com\r\n"

  body: Yeah the small type is starting to fall apart. Bust the design should be done
    with the output in mind. There's some fine examples on the website.
