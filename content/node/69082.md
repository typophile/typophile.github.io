body: "Two fonts opened in FontLab, Alpha and Beta. The only difference between the
  two fonts is, that one glyph is missing in Alpha. And that glyph is the left and
  the right partner of kerning pairs in Beta. Select the glyph from Beta, copy it
  and append (context menu) it to Alpha. And now check the kerning. Only the kerning
  of those pairs is appended, in which the copied and appended glyph is the left partner.
  The other pairs are ignored.\r\n\r\nIf you also want to have the kerning of the
  pairs, in which the copied glyph is the right partner, you have to select the appended
  glyph in Alpha and command \"Paste special\" (Strg+Alt+V) and in the dialog the
  check boxes for pasting the kerning must be activated.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug, isn\u2019t
  it? Is it already documented? I have learned to be careful talking about bugs. This
  time I checked it three times. Can anyone verify, that I am right?\r\n"

  body: "Arno, \r\n\r\nthere are three ways to append some glyphs from one font to
    another: \r\n1. Tools / Merge Fonts\r\n2. Fonts panel / Append Glyphs\r\n3. Font
    Window / Index mode / Paste\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the three ways produce different
    results. \"Append Glyphs\" is an older feature, so I believe it may produce less
    satisfying results. \"Merge Fonts\" is a better way (also has more options that
    control what should happen). "

  body: "@ Adam\r\n\r\nHey, you have a new avatar. It\u2019s the same twardoch as
    in the midday.\r\n\r\nWhen I command \"Merge Fonts\", the fonts will be completely
    merged, but I want to append a few glyphs only. And I don\u2019t want to loose
    control there. If I command \"Merge Fonts\" I had more things to check.\r\n\r\nMy
    problem with the command \"Append Glyphs\" is not, that it produces a different
    result than the other commands, but it copies the \"left half\" of the kerning
    and I think, I have too much trusted in it in the past, that it copies both. Do
    you know, what I mean? You see that the kerning has grown after appending, that
    the pairs were correctly copied, but you don\u2019t ask the question, whether
    all pairs were copied.\r\n\r\n@ Chris and Adam\r\n\r\nYes, the command \"Paste
    Special\" is an alternative, if all checkboxes in the white field are activated
    and additionally the checkbox \"Ignore Destination selection, map glyphs by names\"
    (Otherwise you have to rename the glyphs after the command \"Paste Special\").\r\n\r\nAnd
    in this context I found another bug:\r\n\r\nIf I copy the glyph from Beta and
    paste it via \"Paste Special\" into Alpha, the pasted glyphs are not visible!
    The character counter has grown, but I first have to switch to the index mode
    and back, before they are visible. But at least both parts of the kerning will
    be copied, the right and the left one. So, thank you, Chris.\r\n\r\nAdam, after
    each step I do in FontLab I check, if everything is correct. My problem is, I
    don\u2019t know exactly, what everything is. Because it has happened so often,
    that anything does not work as expected, I don\u2019t trust in the application.
    It even begins, when I drag and drop a vfb file to FontLab. Do you know, how I
    do that?: I position the cursor almost at the top of the Window, because I am
    afraid, that I accidentally select and move characters, when the cursor is on
    top of the glyph window after dropping the vfb file. I handle the app like porcelain,
    because I am always afraid to damage anything, that I recognize five steps later.
    And then it can be hard to undo it.\r\n\r\nI mean, I was a very good Photoshopper
    five or six years ago. Now I am out of practice. But I remember, that I could
    work in it in a way, that my subconsciousness said my hands, what is to do, and
    I did not have to activate my consciousness so often. This breaks inspiration.
    Well, the two applications are not comparable, but I wish, I had not always this
    fear to damage anything.\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, cool. \"Paste Special\" is cool. It kills the hinting of the copied
    glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe command \"Paste Special\" cannot replace the command \"Paste\".
    Genius!\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n1. Copy\r\n2. Append Glyphs\r\n3. Select appended
    glyphs and command \"Paste Special\" for right and left kerning\r\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t
    forget to activate the two check boxes for left and right kerning in the white
    field after each start of FontLab.\r\n\r\nOne more time I lost time. Now I have
    to hint my glyphs again.\r\n\r\nOh, and if you assume, that the option \"Font
    Window / Kerning information is copied with the glyph\" does not work as it should,
    you are damn right, because it is the same as with the appending command: Only
    those pairs are copied, in which the copied glyph is the left partner.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nFLS

  body: "Arno, \r\n\r\nthis is unfortunate, but kerning is stored in FontLab Studio
    that way: kerning is stored with that glyph which is the 1st glyph in a kerning
    pair. I agree however that the copying should behave differently and not rely
    on FontLab's internal object representation -- which should not be the user's
    concern. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
