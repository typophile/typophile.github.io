  body: Try the D from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/baskerville-no2-t/semi-bold/win-t1/138805/character/0044/CP2/1/"
    target="_blank">Baskerville</a>. It may be close to what you&#39;re looking for.

  body: My first thought was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/clarendon/urw-clarendon-t-regular-narrow/testdrive.html?s=D&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Clarendon</a>, but it&#39;s not rounded enough.

  body: baskerville was close but the top of the inside of the D does not match and
    the serifs are too long.
