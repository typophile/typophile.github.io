body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here know what this font is.  I am not sure what
  word you would use to search for similar fonts - Victorian or Western perhaps?  I
  assume the font on the top line has been modified and the squiggle lines at either
  end have been added.  Any help is appreciated. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/end-of-the-line-pub_4050.jpg]"

  body: It is something along that line, however Tuscan fonts appear to usually have
    split ends on the letters.  The centre spurs are similar to some of the Tuscan
    fonts and to Old or Wild West fonts, but the curls on the P, B and E are different.  Now
    I am driven to find out what this font is ;)  It certainly is handsome.
