body: Hello. I need some help identifying a font name which was found when researching
  possibilites for wedding invitations. I am frustrated because the company &#40;regency
  thermographics&#41; only displays the font number &#40;#345&#41;, but no name. It
  seems unique because the lower case letters are just smaller versions of the uppercase.
  Any help is much appreciated!  <BR> <BR>&#40;another question - do stationary companies
  intentionally omit the font name so customers wont <BR>copy? thanks again!&#41;

  body: Using that sample size as a reference, I&#39;m not certain it&#39;s the  <BR>same
    font, but <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=C.2780.4.7&amp;attributes.sampleSize=48&amp;sampleText=Mr.+Brian+A+Fulton&amp;sampleSize=32"
    target="_blank">Classic Roman</a> is close.

  body: Wow! Thanks for the direction. I was thinking copperplate gothic, but I can
    see how the uppercase &#39;A&#39; is much different. Thank you very much!

    target="_blank">Classic Roman Light</a> but hard to tell from such a small sample.

  body: Actually, they are not faux small caps - that is how the font was designed.
    There is no lower case. The weights of the caps and the small caps are consistent,
    unlike what you get with &#34;faux&#34; small caps. <BR> <BR>Trajan is way off,
    look at the M.
