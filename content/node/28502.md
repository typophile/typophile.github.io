  body: "I think you obviously need to kern in the M closer to the o and the o closer
    to the l. Or conversely kern out the l further from the l and the l further from
    the y. All the letterforms should visually have the same amount of white space
    between them. The colored counter will alter that a bit but not by much.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Why the 'tm' is so small and on the bottom ?\r\nBefore adjusting the white
    space as Gerald Lange said, I think you could try to reduce a tad the larger diameter
    of the 'o' keeping the same stroke thickness (I am thinking this because of the
    use of the orange)."

  body: I forgot to say to keep the baseline for the 'o'. Ah, another point, why do
    you present it for critique in such an abundant space ?

  body: The l and the y are too close together. I'd also enlarge the TM slightly and
    tuck it in under the y more - where it is now it gets too much attention.

  body: "Gerald:\r\n\r\nI have done as you suggested. (see pdf)\r\n\r\nAllessandro:\r\n\r\nI
    am affraid I don't quite follow you. Are you saying make the \"o\" glyph smaller!?
    As far as the \"abundant space\"... well, its just a letter sized PDF that I printed
    to. In my experience it has been easier to \"preview\" things on a larger workspace.
    Seems less distracting.\r\n\r\nPatty:\r\n\r\nI have moved the y out a bit from
    the l. My concern was that there was a lot of counter space there. How does this
    look!?\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback all.\r\n\r\nKyle"

    has less space between the l and y.)"

  body: If we really only see the top half of words while we scan, then I'd agree
    that the -y- is too close to the -l-. Tricky kerning challenge. :^)

    of white space (that is to say without other character or words next to it)...
    would the same apply!?"

  body: I don't know. This is tough. Really. I think I might try making the space
    a hair larger. But, even still, on the whole I think it is working. My tendency
    is to, of course, balance the whole, but I tend to see the top more than the bottom
    first.
