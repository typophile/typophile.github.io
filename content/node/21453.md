  body: I doubt this was modified from an existing font. Custom drawn is more likely.
    The suggestions given are the closest I know of.

  body: Actually, to me at least anyway, it seems like a customized and really bold
    version of Baker Signet would nail down that Triumph lettering. I could be wrong
    though.
