    time a TypeCon discussion item came up in an other Typophile thread (I avoided
    all the explicitly TypeCon-related topics), I had to hide under my desk. Now I
    can think about brighter things, like, err\u2026 Brighton, where I will be.\r\n\r\nI
    can't remember the name of the hotel in Brighton where I'll be staying. It is
    near the pier, but it seems that every hotel in Brighton is near the pier. I'll
    be in the UK from the 10th of September, but will be spending the first few days
    in Reading, trying to find an apartment for the next academic year. \r\n\r\nI'll
    eat whatever there is to eat; I'm going to Brighton for the type, and for the
    type types, not for the food. But if anyone can offer up any culinary surprises
    (I mean good surprises), I would be quite happy about those, too.\r\n"

    in my experience, the ATypI conference isn't like that at all. First of all, we
    are all dorks, whether we have released typefaces or not ;-) Secondly, the event
    has always seemed newcomer-friendly. I had a delightful time in 2004, when I didn't
    really know anyone there (at least personally). It has been a blast ever since,
    too. "

    There seems to be a shortage of rooms in the area, the only thing we could find
    was a house 3 miles out of town. I am definatlly up for some indigenous food,
    good or bad.
