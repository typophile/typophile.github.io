body: Can anyone help me suggest me a good pairing with Century for a header? I found
  that Century bold doesn't really work for what I'm working on, so preferably, this
  font should look good bold too. Currently, I'm using Cambria, but I was wondering
  if anyone had any other suggestions.

    titles. I was thinking of something serif for the subsections though.

    for a slab serif, or simply for a version of Century which offers a variety of
    styles."
