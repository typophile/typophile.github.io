body: "I just returned yesterday from a week-long workshop at the press and letterfoundry
  of [[http://www.mwbixler.com|Michael & Winifred Bixler]], through the [[http://www.wells.edu/bkarts/info.htm|Wells
  College Summer Book Arts Institute]]. Mike and Winnie Bixler run what is perhaps
  the last fully functioning commercial Monotype shop in the U.S. They do mainly text
  composition for publishers and have been known to do some very high-profile jobs.
  (At the moment, they're typesetting the Book of Mormon, and I had the pleasure of
  watching Winnie set the lengthly title page text in 9 pt by hand \u2014 several
  times.)\r\n\r\nThe workshop was a really enlightening experience. I learned to set
  text on the Monotype keyboard, cast it with the composition caster, and cast individual
  sorts on the Supercaster. For those who, like me before this week, may not know
  much about Monotype, here's a little summary of how it all works:\r\n\r\nMonotype
  is a typesetting technology that was developed around 1890. It is a brilliantly
  designed system that uses nothing but mechanical engineering (gear ratios, fan belts,
  levers, etc) to do some incredible things. The process begins at the keyboard. The
  monotype keyboard is first fitted with the proper \"key bar\" for the face and size
  in which you are going to set your type. This tells the keyboard the width of each
  character and its position in the matte case for the specific font. The keyboard
  has five alphabets: roman lc, roman caps, italic lc, italic, caps, and small caps.
  (If working in a sans serif face, the \"italic\" keys might be used for bold.) The
  tricky thing about the keyboard is that you need to type every piece of metal that
  would appear on a line if you were composing it by hand: every quad, thin space,
  and so on that is necessary to fill out the line to the end of the measure. Also,
  there are special keys for kerning characters that stick off the left of the type
  body (a, e, o) for using after W, V, Y. Oh, and because W is too wide to fit on
  its body, it's necessary to type a high space before every cap W \u2014 at least
  in the typeface I was working in.\r\n\r\nI was brave and decided to start off by
  keyboarding justified text (which actually turned out to be, in my opinion, easier
  than ragged right). When working in justified mode, the keyboard works something
  like a manual typewriter. At four ems from the end of a line, a bell dings and a
  pointer points to a cell on a justification table. The cell contains two numbers
  that the operator types in, which tell the caster how wide to make the spaces in
  order to justify the line. What is incredible to me is that without using any electronics
  \u2014 without having any kind of \"brain\" or processor \u2014 the keyboard is
  able to do the necessary division to arrive at these numbers. As you type, the mechanism
  adds up the widths (eighteen possible) of the characters and counts the spaces,
  then divided the remaining space by the number of word spaces to arrive at the correct
  size for each word space. It's the genius of nineteenth-century mechanics.\r\n\r\nAs
  an operator, you need to anticipate when you're about to start typing what will
  be the last line in a paragraph, and switch to \"ragged right\" mode (pull the lever)
  before you begin that line. When you come to the end of a ragged right line, a notch
  on a gear will point to a digit, 0 through 9. This is the number of Monotype units
  that your line length is under an even multiple of nine. (The Monotype system divides
  the em into eighteen units. An en is nine units.) If the notch indicates 0, you're
  in luck, and you can just quad out to the end of the line: 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 18
  18. If the notch points to, say, 4, you need to add 4 to 9, to get 13 (the necessary
  number of units) and then type the sum into the keyboard on special \"spacer\" keys.
  Here's where it gets tricky. The only spacer keys are 5, 6, 7, and 9 units. So,
  to type \"13,\" you can't just input \"4, 9,\" because there's no four. So you type
  \"6, 7,\" because 6 + 7 = 13. Now you're at an even multiple of nine, and you can
  quad to the end of the line. If you make a mistake, you can hit a \"kill\" key,
  which will cancel that line.\r\n\r\nAs you're typing, the keyboard mechanism punches
  holes in a paper tape, which the caster will read in the manner of a player piano.
  BUT how will the caster know how large to make the spaces or which lines to kill
  when the justification numbers and kill characters are at the end of the line? Well,
  the casting machine reads the paper tape backwards \u2014 so the first characters
  on every line are either the justification commands for that line or a command to
  ignore the line entirely. The composition caster blows compressed air through the
  paper tape, and where there are holes, the air is able to continue down any one
  of a series of tubes that causes metal pegs to pop up in specific locations and
  halt the motion of two levers. These levers position the matte case (which contains
  the molds of every character in the font) over the spigot that is connected to a
  pot of molten lead (700 degrees \u2014 I burned my thumb.) There are also wedges
  that move to certain positions corresponding to a character to indicate how wide
  to cast the body for that character. The machine casts the text at about one character
  per second, and the characters come out in a neat line. After each line is finished,
  a mechanism pushes it out onto a galley, where the lines form a column of text.\r\n\r\nIt
  was an amazing experience seeing my text pop out of the machine a character at a
  time like that. Of course, inevitably I had made typos, which I had to correct by
  hand in a composing stick. In several cases, I forgot paragraph indents and needed
  to rejustify paragraphs by hand.\r\n\r\nThere's something about working in Monotype
  that is inherently different \u2014 and, I think, more rewarding \u2014 than composing
  type on a computer. First of all, I felt proud about every letter on that page when
  I had finished. When it takes complicated mechanical maneuvers to cast an accented
  character, you feel darn proud of that little \xE9. The other wonderful thing about
  working with Monotype is that things that are now only abstract concepts \u2014
  type size, measure, leading \u2014 are real-world, mechanical considerations. If
  I wanted to change the type size on the Supercaster, I had to spin the metal wheel
  and try my best to spin it accurately. If I wanted to change the measure, I had
  to keyboard the whole text over again. No undo command, no room for guessing, no
  allowance for making up the design as you go.\r\n\r\nIn addition to casting text,
  I cast a font of Hebrew on the Supercaster, which casts one sort at a time. The
  Bixlers had been given a font of Hebrew mattes, but had never had a use for them.
  Since I know some Hebrew, I figured I'd give it a go, and so I ended up being the
  first person to cast and print from this Hebrew font, of which there are apparently
  only two sets of mattes known to exist.\r\n\r\nSo what does it mean to work in Monotype
  in the modern world? Mike estimates that he has about enough paper tapes to last
  another year. What will he do after that? I asked, and he doesn't yet know. But
  this is such a rewarding way of producing typographic work that I want to see it
  stay alive.\r\n\r\nI figured that some Typophiles might be interested in my experiences,
  which is why I found myself writing this lengthy description. Has anyone else here
  worked in Monotype and have stories to share?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bixlers_4446.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bixlers2_5082.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bixlers3_5868.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bixlers4_6189.jpg]\r\n\r\n(I
  ended up with two Tupperware containers of typos:)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bixlers5_4688.jpg]"

    was indeed a brilliant bit of mechanical computing. \r\n\r\nThis is also the crux
    of the reason for unitized widths in Monotype designs, which we often talk about,
    but which I don\u2019t think [young] people realize the rationale behind.\r\n\r\nThe
    Linotype had a completely different method for justifying mechanically (the tapered
    spaceband). And it had it\u2019s own bit of brilliant mechanical computing for
    the sorting and redistribution of the matrices.\r\n\r\nThese two hot-metal composing/casting
    machines really were *amazing* inventions.\r\n\r\nExcellent descriptions, Joshua.
    Congratulations on the whole experience."

  body: Of course, mechanical justification took place in mechanisms far humbler than
    a Monotype caster. Although the unit system was far more crude, yielding results
    that were not acceptable as real typography, the humble Varityper carried out
    this task.
