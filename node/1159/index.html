		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm. Souvenir goes for the 'warm and fuzzy' like Goudy, but isn't as warm. (Designers tend to dislike warm and fuzzy, and the public likes it.) Souvenir has more discipline than Goudy, coming originally from Benton. But Benguiat, the self-named font, and Goudy are trying for similar things, and I think Goudy is definitely the greater face. It has grace where Benguiat is awkward by comparison. I dislike the squashed l.c. 'g' in Goudy, which I think is its only failed letter, but that is another story.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I admire FW Goudy for a good many of his types, mannered or not. Many designers will flat out declare &quot;I like Goudy&quot; or &quot;I hate Goudy&quot;, referring to Goudy Oldstyle, and not knowing that the man did so many more types than the one he is best known for. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The squashed &quot;g&quot; in Goudy Oldstyle was thanks to ATF, whose drawing department head, in hand with the marketing people, ignoring Goudy's vehement protests, deemed that the type would sell better with short descenders. Goudy's original drawings exhibited a much longer descent. Lanston Type Co. of Finland has produced both versions, which you can see on their website. The effect makes it an altogether different type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type and their designers are too subjective a thing to bother getting defensive about, and certainly defending FWG will do him no good now. It's an accomlishment to leave this planet with one good typeface to a person's credit. We can thank Goudy for a good many: University of California Oldstyle (Californian a few years later by Lanston and in the last 15 years a derivative by ITC called Berkeley). Deepdene, Kaatskill, Bertham, Goudy Modern, Forum, Kennerley Oldstyle, Garamont. That a few of these never reached a national market is due to the shortsightedness of the foundries of the day. The designs themselves are solid and wonderfully structured. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One must also consider that the man was making type that would sell in 1925, and didn't have the advantage of being able to extrapolate on designs that hadn't happened yet. Goudy was attempting to break new ground, based mainly on Venetian sources. If he wandered from time to time into an ornamental mood, that, too, was very much in vogue. Look at Robert Weibking's Artcraft (Ludlow, and BB&amp;S). FWG was making new and stylish designs (some perhaps too stylish designs), but he was trying. In addition he did these single-handedly, designing, cutting matrices, and casting fonts for sale. With no other help than that of his wife, he carried on like this for decades, at the same time warding off criticisms of &quot;too commercial, self absorbed, vain and arrogant.&quot; Everyone else was busily making the soulless &quot;moderns&quot; that brought the look of book printing in the pre-twenties to a sorry decline. William Morris railed against the poor quality of book-making, as did Eric Gill. Bruce Rogers (who adored Goudy and his work) had no love for the type that was available to a book, designer in 1915. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Young designers and students have the benefit of the information he left behind with his &quot;Typologia&quot;. Certainly no other foundry at the time was forthcoming with any of the internal secrets of the type-making process. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Goudy was and is accused of repeating himself. I think many designers do that. It's in the personal quality of a human creature's line. You can look it up, because I can't recall who it was in Alan Haley's book, &quot;Hot Designers Make Cool Fonts&quot; who stated that every time he drew an &quot;a&quot; it looked the same as the last one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My God, I've gotten passionate about it. I'll try not to let that happen again. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer</div>

On the other hand, I don't think that those of us who admire Goudy are wrong, anymore than one who despises his work is correct. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe that that is why there are faces in the world as diverse as Montype 49J Gothic, Lutetia, and Fournier; all of which I place an equal value upon, and would use them . . . just not on the same page. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I love it that we are poles apart in our choice of type heroes, but I have to mention that I also admire Goudy's former student, WA Dwiggins. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From another post, I was surprised to hear that Helvetica is now on this capricious world's list of &quot;don't touch with a barge pole&quot; typefaces. I had always thought that Helvetica was superbly drawn, and is as good now as it was when it was released; but then, I was there when it was. If you were designing in 1962, at its release in North America, your choices would have been Metro or Trade Gothic, and I like BOTH of those. It's just that the world was ready for something new. Helvetica would not by my choice for long texts. Back then a lot of careers were established using Helvetica. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We see something too much and it takes on a tiresome complexion. I think it's called fashion, or maybe it's called fickle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I found to my surprise a while that I have two Monotype diecases of Helvetica: 10 and 12 point. Hey, I'm going to run down into the foundry an cast some tomorrow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Goudy's A Half Century of type and Typography makes mention of his (not hostile or arrogant) joust with ATF over the descent of Goudy Oldstyle. And do take a look at the Lanston showing of the long descender version. You don't have to like it. It's just history. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With foundries in the days of metal, is was common for the head of the Drawing Office to make artistic decisions about new faces. That person could do so with absolute authority. A good many prominent designers have suffered the same unpleasant surprise in seeing their design change before their eyes. By all accounts Goudy was firm, but lost the argument. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You said passion was OK, right? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim rimmer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Goudy, an American type designer with an appeal to the American Eye. Go figure. I would know something of that because I sell in both markets. I sell Goudy that is, lots of it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also I do not necessarily see anything wrong with localized taste in typography. Because of my strong believe that type design is, but losing, connections to different mother tongues. I think globalized typography is damaging the roots of language and thought. But this is another matter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;.. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like those years when Bauhaus thought anything with decoration or not severely geometrical was bad&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don't we still suffer from that? I live in Finland. The old is mainly preserved by government restrictions. For instance you can not paint your house any colour you want, you do not buy a house, you buy a yellow house or a pink house. That is what is deeded. So the old always looks like it always did. Some merely newer than others by the freshness of paint. &quot;There are very limited paint colours sold in Finland for exteriors of houses and buildings.&quot; For god sakes, what ever you do, don't buy paint from Sweden. &quot;Those would be Swedish colours&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first &quot;new housing&quot; in a &quot;new housing area&quot; dictates what all houses will forever look. Ugly is sacred.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new is so straight it makes water level arch.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You could not build a beautiful house if you wanted to. If you build a house in a new area it will look like the walls of a train station bathroom, if you build in the country it will look like a barn. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eleil Saarinen would not be able to build the houses and buildings that he is so famous for were he working in Finland today. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This should give warning to us that if distillations of unforgiving opinions of those with dictitorial ilk are allowed to govern typographical taste in the future all typography will look like &quot;Nokia on steroids&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So god bless Goudy and America! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald Giampa</div>
