body: So as not to hijack Ralf&#39;s thread, I decided to start a new one. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
  like to know everyone&#39;s impressions on why Mrs. Eaves has become such a very
  popular font in such a short time and whether or not it maybe just a temporary phase.
  <BR> <BR>Personally, I think the charm of Mrs. Eaves is the fact that it looks modern,
  but has such a wonderful antique feel to it.  Combined with the extra ligatures
  and it&#39;s lovely italic, Mrs. Eaves can be quite whimsical without being very
  &#34;scripty&#34; or novelty. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to think that it will be around
  for a long time, though I&#39;m not sure if it will ever take a place alongside
  the big classics such as Garamond and Caslon.

  body: 'I think there are two reasons: <BR>1&#41; It combines femininity with what
    Bilak calls &#34;synthetic construction&#34;. This is a very rare combination
    in type &#40;usually feminine faces are very chirographic&#41;, and novelty is
    an important force in marketing. One could also add that femininity in society
    in general has been on the decline, and is now missed. <BR>2&#41; There was a
    massive core of Emigre lovers who wanted desperately to set a lot of text in an
    Emigre face. With Mrs Eaves they could finally do it! Except they didn&#39;t know
    enough about the importance of tight/regular spacing to readabilty... <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Mrs. Eaves may be be chique, fancy, fresh, charming, cool, &#34;feminine&#34;,
    beautiful etc etc. <BR> <BR>But it has rarely anything to do with good typography.
    It is superficial, shallow and, in short, an abomination. <BR> <BR>It is a failure
    of ITC Garamond proportions. <BR> <BR>Use it as you wish.  <BR>It may bring you
    luck, it might even bring you typographical insight, but do not set any amount
    of text over ten syllables. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll leave it to the good people of Typophile
    to explain the finer details of the relationship between the x-height and the
    ascenders and so forth, while I, in desperate need for more nuance, go and polish
    my english typographical vocabulary. <BR> <BR>Next time I&#39;ll post as a registered

    <BR> <BR>&#62; the finer details of the relationship between the x-height and
    the ascenders and so forth <BR> <BR>The problem with Mrs Eaves isn&#39;t just
    that the spacing is messy &#40;with only 40-something kerning pairs to patch things
    up&#41; it&#39;s that its overall loose spacing goes against all its other parameters,
    like the tiny x-height, and the lightish color. You can&#39;t use it small, and
    you can&#39;t use it large. Except if you throw InDesign&#39;s optical spacing
    on it, in which case you can use it for about 14-24 point. <BR> <BR>Robin Kinross
    has equated Mrs Eaves with a loose bicycle. I wouldn&#39;t ride it myself, but
    at least it&#39;s very pretty. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR>They should&#39;ve fixed the spacing in the OT version. <BR>&#60;bad_joke&#62;And
    called the new version Mr Richard, Mrs Eaves&#39;s ex-husband.&#60;/bad_joke&#62;

  body: I&#39;ve mainly seen Mrs Eaves used quite large, most strangely in information
    panels at the Doge&#39;s Palace in Venice. The spacing is loose, but it is also
    a strangely wide face, so the spacing is not as bad as it might be for a narrower
    face, but I still would be inclined to respace it and add more kerning pairs if
    I ever had occasion to use the face. <BR> <BR>Bilak is <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/">Peter
    Bilak</a>, who gave my second favourite presentation at TypeCon.

  body: Mrs. Eaves can be condensed a bit to make up for the wideness of it. Not a
    lot mind you, but it can be. I just wish the serifs were a little smaller or shorter.
    <BR> <BR>The way I see it, if a typeface is poorly spaced, but fits the bill for
    your needs, you shouldn&#39;t shy away from the challenge of using it. I do have
    some personal opinions about Mrs. Eaves, but even still I use it because it is
    unique and it does stand out. But, I don&#39;t use it when I need a crystal goblet.

  body: You are right about that plain&#42;clothes. But I still think there is life
    in her yet. But when I&#39;ve used it, it is usually in display or sub-display
    tasks. I&#39;m talking advertising. Yes I know it is everywhere. But what if,
    perchance I can use it in a fresh way? With an unexpected type combination? I&#39;m
    not going to throw it out just because it is everywhere.
