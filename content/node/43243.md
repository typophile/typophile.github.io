body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI created metrics class to copy the RSB (Right Side Bearing)and
  Width of the key glyph to other glyphs of the class. I expected that RSB and Width
  of all class members will be the same and LSB will differ according to outlines
  shape of every glyph. But actually, the Width is copied and both RSB and LSB are
  changed. So what's the right way to get the result I expected?\r\n"
