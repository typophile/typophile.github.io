  body: "Nice!\r\nI like the way you have expanded the family styles, but in a single
    weight and scaling.\r\nThe charming letter proportions strike a nice balance between
    slick contemporary type (e.g. tail on l) and slightly vernacular retro lettering.\r\n\r\nThe
    ogonek should probably be connected, and definitely to the right stroke of the
    \"a\", not centred. And the slash on l-slash angled."

  body: "Nick Shinn, \r\n\r\nThank you for your reply, you are right, the ogonek should
    probably be connected, also Dcaron is not typical or traditional in \"Public Gothic
    Little\". But, There are so many suggestion about scedilla in my country and many
    of them are better than traditional variations. i mean, my Dcaron or Aogonek much
    better than typical variation and i think it is useful. Of course final word of
    this issue should come from the Central european Designers."

    it is useful.</em>\r\n\r\nThey are incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe comparison with scedilla
    is not valid.\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to compare the dcaron to the scedilla
    situation, but only with regards to a choice between the \"apostrophe\" form of
    the accent and the \"acute\" form. Using the v-shaped caron centred above the
    letter is not an option.\r\n"
