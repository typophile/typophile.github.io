body: "This is one of my first fonts. Based on the infamous \"2 Line English Egyptian.\"\r\nI
  thought rather than trying to create lowercase letters, badly, that I would simply
  go the Small Caps route. The Small Caps have been shrunk and the weight was added
  to to get a more similar bar-width? to the uppercase. There have also been a number
  of slight modifications. The O's were slightly enlarged to help offset the optical
  illusion that occurs with all O's I find, that it simply doesn't look as big as
  it actually is, and makes the x height look inconsistent. I also chopped of a good
  bit of the cross bar of the T's, and widened up the J, which looked extremely clumsy
  and almost pathetic IMO.\r\n\r\nAll Criticism appreciated.\r\n\r\nI would also like
  to know if anyone has any opinions on creating numbers for this font. Should it
  even be attempted? Is it sacrilegious, lol? And what is the first sans-serif typeface
  with numbers known?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JupiterSC 11_6136.24.png]"
