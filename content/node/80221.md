  landing 100% on the pixel, but the Quartz rendering still manage to throw them off.
  My em is 1100, all stems are 100 units and all character widths are multiples of
  100. The CSS font size is 11 px. Any idea why this is happening? Also, see \"ploughline\"
  which is all fuzzed up. Am I doing something wrong in the font settings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    in colour bleed. I made a similar test in Windows some months back, and found
    that even when outlines and metrics were snapped to a grid, as in your 'pixel
    font' example, there was a small amount of pale yellow and blue bleed.\r\n\r\nSee

    the light fringing occurring. The feature alignment is definitely going out of
    phase with the grid, so it's either the advance widths, or the composition ignoring
    them for some adjustment..."

  body: Rendering control where hinting has no effect is the whole point here, Thomas.
    Both binary rendering and Quartz rendering works like a charm (with this first
    issue resolved). The troublemaker is actually Cleartype, especially diagonals.

    stems in CT.  It is thin diagonals and thin verticals where it fails miserably.
