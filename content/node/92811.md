  to design glyphs for currencies that are not in use anymore, like pesetas and francs.
  I realize the symbols might still be in use for historical reasons, but in a display
  face, I think it's rather unlikely.\r\n\r\nHow do you guys do? What do you think?"

    support and extensive features, then adding those characters makes sense; for
    everyday display work, it really doesn\u2019t make much sense."

    them out: somebody might end up paying you to add them.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Guaran\xED, Spesmilo (I think) and Kip, repurposed for Galleons, Sickles and Knuts."
