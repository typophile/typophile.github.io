  body: Thanks Mike, Yes I am familiar with Burgues Script which does bare some resemblance
    to this. This script takes on a very upright positioning, which is so hard to
    find with most digitalized versions of calligraphic script hand. Many are heavily
    slanted, and lack in alternate functions.
