body: "Hi fellas\r\nI'm looking for a book (or site) which shows the differences in
  fonts of different vendors. For example: an Adobe Caslon is maybe more true to the
  original than an ITC Caslon but the ITC has maybe a better legibility in smaller
  grades due to an increased x-height and a Berthold Caslon blablabla....\r\n\r\nDoes
  something like this exist or do i have to invent it? ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers and thanx
  for help!\r\n\r\nRoland"

  body: I think this would be fascinating - a comparative study, in rigorously formalist
    terms, of the various revivals of, say, Jenson, Griffo, Garamond, Granjon, Jannon,
    van den Keere, van Dijk, Kis, Caslon, Fleischman, and Fournier.
