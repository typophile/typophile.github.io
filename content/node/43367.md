    there is no dominant language, if you can use two opposing emphasis techniques
    to distinguish but not give one importance it's better.  Say for instance, making
    one bold and one normal, but then making the bold one gray and the normal one
    black so they end up standing out about the same.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es

    :-)\r\n\r\nAS far as I'm concerned, there should either be a space between languages
    or one above the other. This is the only one that they want a slash between languages.
    I was just wondering if \"they\" knew something I don't\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: "Canada is a bad choice. In Quebec, the most bilingual of the bilingual provinces,
    English is not treated equally. French must be larger and (I think) to the right
    or above. In the other bilingual provinces (Ontario, New Brunswick, Manitoba,
    Saskatchewan, I think) English is the dominant language although it gets fair
    treatment with French.\r\n\r\nOur federal government tends to try to make the
    department names similar in both languages, and if not, shows them side by side
    (order can be exchanged, depending on the predominant language where the sign
    will be). See http://www.tc.gc.ca/en/menu.htm and http://www.tc.gc.ca/fr/menu.htm\r\n\r\n"
