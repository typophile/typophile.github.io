    going on?

  body: The "S" is large to make the logo stand out.. and to give it a little majestic
    look. Plus, i made it float.. so to give that we're not bind to traditional methods
    (straight aligned lines..etc). Also, for products check the description, i added
    few lines detailing it.

  body: Yeah, I think if you tighten the space between the C and the A, it would be
    an improvement.

  body: Yes, "A" definitely has too much space around it, also the top of the "C"
    appears optically somewhat lower than the "A", while "A" seems too narrow compared
    to the other letters.

  body: "This is stock Futura light, the URW++ version methinks. It's not custom lettering
    so complaints about letter widths seem inappropriate.\r\n\r\nFutura has proportional
    capitals based on the carefully-worked-out ratios of the Trajan inscription. The
    differing letter widths harmonize in complimentary fashion. They're not designed
    to please people who think every element in a logo or a typeface should be uniform.
    It amazes me how many graphic designers and art directors evidently fail to appreciate
    this. Sure the N looks wide---it's meant to be that way.\r\n\r\nSince the designer
    has chosen this font and not one with even width caps, the best that can be done
    is to optimize the optical density of the composition. So we tighten up the space
    between C and A, and do the same for A and S.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the overall spacing
    makes the uneven density less noticable and adds elegance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/casini1_4364.gif]\r\n\r\n^
    The large S looks unweildy to me too, so I moved it to a dropped position to allow
    A to be brought closer beside it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/casini2_6083.gif]\r\n\r\n^
    I think this works better. A tad more letterspacing makes it a touch more elegant.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/casini3_5113.gif]\r\n\r\n^
    Substantially more spacing gives a more relaxed vibe appropriate to the product(s)
    conducive to a life of refinement.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    have to respectfully disagree, James. The modulating widths in the typeface are
    meant to assist in readability as a text.  A logotype/wordmark has different requirements.
    \ These specific letters need to hold together as a singular unit.  So, I consider
    it necessary to adjust certain letter widths like the N and maybe the A to harmonize
    better.\r\n\r\nThat all said, your examples of additional letterspacing do help
    minimize some of the unevenness.  Therein lies my biggest criticism of Casini's
    latest version: it all feels incredible cramped.  The C and A have a nice space,
    but the S feels a touch too close to the A (some redrawing of the S could probably
    solve this).  And then the INI feels like it's about to get into a fender bender
    and needs to back off.\r\n\r\n\r\n(edited to add italicized quote at top)"

    you are looking at this more from a typographer's point-of-view and I'm from a
    logo designer's POV.  So, I'd understand why you hesitate to change someone else's
    letterform. I don't see an error in alterations if it benefits the logo.  But
    you are free to disagree with me and I with you.  That's life, right?"
