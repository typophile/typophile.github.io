    (maybe not hard enough) - though it was kind of short notice. You were missed.
    We'll meet again soon! \r\n\r\nGreat seeing & meeting those who did come out -
    and thanks Eben for the restaurant recommendation, it was great!"

    dessert (see Zara's or Carl's pictures) was fab. Next time I'm going to get the
    cider. It was good see everyone again and to meet you Eben, Grant and Shu for
    the first time.\r\n\r\nStefan, you were missed. Hopefully I'll get to see you
    before you return home and perhaps Rod could be cajoled into coming out to play
    too. There was talk last night of putting together an east bay typophile gathering
    sometime soon. Anyone want to suggest a date?"
