  us type-novices. Here\u2019s a list of five vague design briefs. Name - off the
  cuff - one or two fonts (body / text?) you\u2019d choose for each. Could be a classic
  or a little-known modern gem, something which obviously fits the brief, or something
  weirder.\r\n\r\n1. A book of contemporary poetry.\r\n2. A poster advertising a left-wing
  demonstration.\r\n3. A minutely detailed, finely illustrated, copiously footnoted
  but slightly quirky miscellany.\r\n4. A world war one strategy boardgame (cover,
  pieces and instructions).\r\n5. The kama sutra, a new translation."

  body: Hrant, I sympathize with the original poster. This is designed to be a learning
    experience, not fun. I, probably like the OP, have spent time on this forum looking
    at lists of font suggestions (for an adventure novel, or a cookbook, or spring-themed
    poetry, whatever) trying to figure out why the suggested fonts are appropriate.
    It's just something you learn a little at a time.  This seems like a useful exercise.

  body: "Not what you asked for, but you\u2019ll learn more this way. Take it with
    a grain of salt.\r\n\r\n1. A book of contemporary poetry:\r\nA serif, not to strict
    (with room for some passion), probably humanist (venetian or old-style), fairly
    low x-height (long extenders) for more leading.\r\n\r\n2. A poster advertising
    a left-wing demonstration:\r\nSans serif, harsh, rough, certainly not delicate
    or \u201Ccorporate\u201D, grotesque and bold (filling as much surface as possible,
    grabbing attention) or geometric (industrial)\r\n\r\n3. A minutely detailed, finely
    illustrated, copiously footnoted but slightly quirky miscellany:\r\nIf it includes
    long texts: A somewhat \u201Cinvisible\u201D serif text face (between old-style
    and transitional) with optical sizes. Optionally a text face with a structurally
    matching sans-serif for notes.\r\nOtherwise: I might also consider a somewhat
    \u201Cinvisible\u201D text sans with optical sizes and/or very close weights (closer
    than most contemporary families).\r\n\r\n4. A world war one strategy boardgame
    (cover, pieces and instructions).\r\nA strict text serif (prob. transitional or
    veering towards modern if still readable), possibly matched with a rough grotesque
    or geometric sans serif for shorter stuff and for contrast. I\u2019d also consider
    throwing in a display face from the time period.\r\n\r\n5. The kama sutra, a new
    translation.\r\nNo idea. \r\n\r\nAdd to that the needs of the content: emphasis,
    language support & other technical challenges."

  body: "I'm disappointed by the left-wing demonstration font choices. I live near
    and work at a university campus in the UK and there are various protest posters
    up all the time - they are always terrible. People with no design sense trying
    to be radically avant garde. The font choices above reflect the same: \"harsh,
    rough ... grotesque and bold (filling as much surface space as possible, grabbing
    attention)\" as frode frank said.\r\n\r\nHere is an example from a campaign currently
    running where they have used this typeface not only for the website/logo but for
    smaller sizes like 20pt with long lists of speakers. Unreadable.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/banner2012v3_4853.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    would use a thick but contemporary, humanist, readable sans serif like Meta Headline.
    The left, at least in the UK, needs to reclaim clarity and implicit humanism from
    the establishment.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.christianschwartz.com/metahead.shtml"

  body: "If you believe your left wing demonstration is all about gentle love for
    the humanity, maybe look at some display faces with a humanist touch? It might
    be mistaken for something else though: The radical left style guide is kinda semented.\r\n\r\nIn
    general, humanist designs are less display-geared.  IMO this is one of the philosophies
    of the modern/grotesque genre: closing up and filling the surface. "

    own reflexive blindness.\r\n\r\n(wondering from Frode Frank, which humanist sans
    are display geared? +Are there soft humanist Impact or poster-font style fonts
