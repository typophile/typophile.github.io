<p>Satya, I had the opportunity to spend an afternoon with him a few years ago. He has great stories to tell. Personally, I&rsquo;d like to know what he thinks about the new avant garde in Swiss graphic design… it is very different from the movement he helped create back in the 1970s. I&rsquo;m talking about teams like Lineto, Büro Destrukt, Optimo, Norm, and all these great students making new (but often illegible) grid- and system-based typefaces.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I found him to be a very good teacher, and visually very perceptive.  He was much more open than I thought he would be.  He is also a lot of fun.  Like any teacher, learn from him what you can in your short time together but don&rsquo;t be afraid to question what he says. He is open to that and the dialogue which follows is a very good thing for both of you.
He is not a type designer, he is a skiiled and creative type user who pushes the boundries of visual syntax purely with type&ndash;and a very limited palette of it.  Think of it like reducing the number of variables in a scientific experiment. It is easier to focus on the manipulated variables if you control as many of the others as possible.</p>

They may not be universally accepted or even appreciated by some others but that should not prevent them from choosing their own path. Weingart has spent his life as a teacher and has been successful at it with the methods he chose.  Others may be successful teachers doing quite the opposite.  That is the beauty of the human mind. It does not have to be confined by the opinions of others. There are plenty of things he has done which I might look at and say &ldquo;that is crazy&rdquo;.

		<div class="commentbody">I had the unbeatable pleasure of studying with Weingart this summer—an amazing teacher and a very generous individual. And he loves being asked questions, is alarmed when students exhibit no curiosity, especially curiosity about the past, about history. So do pose questions. You could ask about his approach to teaching, the years with Armin Hoffman. Also, you could talk about what he sees as the difference between laying out by hand as opposed to laying out on a computer, about the disappearance of manual work in typography. If you really want to get him going, you could ask about his views on grids&hellip;</div>

He feels (or used to feel) quite strongly about it and said helvetica was the epitome of ugliness and that anyone who uses helvetica knows nothing about typefaces&hellip;I thought you could tease him&hellip;
serious: after what Linda said I really envy you! I would organise something, show him around Ahmedabad and buy him a drink or two. Go on, ask him: you&rsquo;ve got nothing to loose!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>sorry all. i was a bit busy in academic issues and thus couldnt reply.</p>
<p>Chris..weingart couldnt recall this crazy Greek guy&rsquo;s name but yeah he told me that he had a short two weeks typography class there.</p>
<p>Linda, i told him abt you and yeah he knows you. he told me to say hi to you :)</p>
<p>Dan, I aslo spoken abt you. He said that he went there at Linotype office but i think it was not one which is in bad hamburger. where did you met him?</p>
<p>While dinner he asked me that how do u I know a lot abt him..as I was the only one who asked maximum questions in the session. I told him that am a member of typophile and we&rsquo;ve already discussed you there. and i think he knows abt this forum.</p>
<p>i really liked him what said in the session. he said we dont need much typefaces now. As he said in his book that only four typefaces can address any typographic problem. He discussed his book..I asked him abt his round compositions.</p>
<p>When I asked him abt his experience with hoffmann and ruder, he showed us a picture taken in NID when he, hoffmann and ruder visited NID in early 60s(sorry I couldn&rsquo;t recall the exact year of visit). he was around 20 at that time.</p>
<p>He made me shut by saying that its a different story when i asked what he thinks abt Helvetica. :)</p>
<p>he discussed hot metal, and he showed some of his works.</p>
<p>For now he has no plan to write any other book..But i told him that plz make it lighter this time( he laughed)..its too heavy to hold;)</p>

<p>You are very lucky man. I am really want to meet Weingart so much.
this is his website  <a href="http://www.weingartarchive.com/">http://www.weingartarchive.com/</a>
he does summer school in Basel. IT suppose to be good.</p>
<p>he had some book published too. If you can find in your libary 
its called Projekte 1. Its very rare book but its so nice.
and its not thick at all :-)</p>
<p>Someone make a film abt swiss typography as well 
you can check this out <a href="http://www.nyfilmvideo.com/2006/lamarch2006/typecast/index.htm">http://www.nyfilmvideo.com/2006/lamarch2006/typecast/index.htm</a>
its far far away from my expectation. :-( 
I am crazy about swiss typography and I wont buy the film</p>
