  body: I&#39;m an Adobe user and with the CS series coming out its more intergrated
    than ever. They made the same type engine for all the products except GoLive.
    The ability to make a page layout in InDesign and use the same elements to create
    web pages in GoLive is cool. Dan

  body: I have always used Adobe software &#40;notably Illustrator since version 1.1&#41;,
    probably much in the same way that I have always been a Mac user. You stick with
    what is comfortable, fits your workstyle, makes functional sense, and continually
    allows you to do your work in an efficient and creative manner. I&#39;m not going
    to go into why Illustrator is better or why Freehand is not - suffice it to say
    that the tools and interface of Illustrator simply work for me better than Freehand
    ever has. I have never been comfortable using Macromedia products probably because
    my workflow has become attuned much more closely with the Adobe interface aesthetic
    &#40;and quirkiness in its own right&#41;. <BR> <BR>And yes, I use Fontographer
    &#40;since version 2.x, back in 1988 as a matter of fact&#41;. This is due to
    no other reasons than force of habit and lack of time to properly acquaint myself
    with FontLab. FontLab is clearly the superior &#40;and supported&#41; tool - but
    the adjustment in order to migrate is daunting.

  body: FontLab all the way. <BR> <BR>For drawing programs, of course I use Illustrator,
    but that&#39;s because I work at Adobe. However, I think I&#39;d go for Illustrator
    CS regardless, since it&#39;s typographic functionality is vastly beyond the competition.

  body: Thomas I use a Mac and the dog Illustrator 10, Illustrator CS can&#39;t come
    out fast enough for me. Doubling the speed means Adobe has been listening to its
    critics. I&#39;m also in love with what they did with the pallets in InDesign
    CS.

  body: I&#39;d love Adobe to make an easy vector editing for Illustrator. Thomas,
    why direct selection selects the &#42;whole&#42; shape?.... :&#39;&#40; Just as
    the black arrow does, and like the white arrow&#43;...  <BR>I find it extremely
    tiring to get the point within 2 pxls... and in case of mistake to deselect and
    try again... Should the app have an easy vector selection &#40;like ALL the other
    vector editing programs&#41;, it would be perfect.

  body: Tim, <BR> <BR>Illustrator and Fontographer for me. <BR> <BR>I made the choice
    about 5-6 years ago to stop swapping between Illustrator and Freehand as it was
    getting confusing. I chose Illustrator because it was the predominant program
    in most the studios I was freelancing at and from my experience still is. <BR>
    <BR>I fell into using Fontographer because I had access to a copy whilst working
    at a studio in London and haven&#39;t had the chance to explore Fontlab although
    it sounds like it might be a better option. <BR> <BR>For page layout our studio
    has made the decision to drop Quark &#40;way too expensive now&#41; and go for
    InDesign so Adobe is proving to be a winner for us.

  body: Massimo, <BR>While the Direct Selection tool &#40;white arrow&#41; works as
    does the Seletion tool &#40;black arrow&#41; when the fill of an object is clicked,
    it selects only that segment or that anchor point on which you click when the
    actual Bezier curve &#40;outside edge&#41; is clicked. As well, if a marquee &#40;rectangle
    shape&#41; is dragged with the Direct Selection tool, only those anchor points
    that are enclosed by the drawn marquee are selected. <BR>I hope that this is of
    some small help. <BR>Dana

  body: Back when I used to work for the <a href="http://www.kinkos.com" target="_blank">
    &#34;McDonalds&#174; of graphic design&#34;</a> I used Freehand. Illustrator was
    available to us, but boy was it confusing to me with it&#39;s many different selection
    tools. I bought FH for home use as Macromedia had one of their early sweet suite
    deals that included Fontographer &#40;and some other products that eventually
    dissapeared ~ Xres anyone?&#41;. Also, back then in my PC-centric days there had
    been no recent upgrade to Illustrator in many a moon. <BR> <BR>Since then I&#39;ve
    figured out Illustrator and eventually switched. it&#39;s nice to check out FH
    once in a while though ~ it has some nice things like multiple pages. But I do
    recall it had it&#39;s own confusing palette problems back in the day that could
    be sort of &#34;unpalettable&#34; to the newbie. <BR> <BR>Remember when three
    upgrades of FH came out in the course of about a year as it switched &#34;owners&#34;
    from Aldus to Altsys to Macromedia?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to switch to FontLab
    but $$$ seems to be an issue these days as I attempt to pay bills during my adventures
    in unemploymentland. I&#39;m also looking forward to speedier Adobe products but
    I think I need a roof over my head more than I need new software. <BR> <BR>Hmmm...
    maybe I could be the graphic designer who lives under the bridge. I can hear it
    now, &#34;He does great work with the latest software as long as you bring some
    gas to help power the generator.&#34;
