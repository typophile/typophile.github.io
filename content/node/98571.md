    There were hundreds of posts by the same poster into multiple topics at exactly
    the same time. This led me to the conclusion that the site has been hacked; someone
    is going directly into the website, accessing the server files directly and loading
    up new content without having to go to each topic separately. I've expressed this
    view to Chris.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    lies in wait targeting other threads, and then hits them all at once. I don\u2019t
    have access to any sort of analytics to help me investigate this theory, or the
    sources, but in the short time I have been helping cleaning up, I have certainly
    noticed some patterns and am actively looking into this. <a href=\"http://readthetype.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Instaspam.jpg\">Best

    not too subtle), or was this added to their name by a mod? I still see posts by
    both.
