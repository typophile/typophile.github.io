body: "I have been excited to see the release of Softmachine ever since Nick was kind
  enough to show it to me a year or so ago. I really like the face's personality which
  is much warmer than VAG rounded or Gotham. Plus It has a <cite>ton</cite> of great
  features including a really great use of one I have advocated for here on Typophile
  - Contextual Alternatives - made not to connect letters in a way that better simulates
  writting ( Nick has done that too in Handsome Pro ) but instead to do something
  even more essential, to get a better fit - or dare I say it? ...A more ideal 'Notan'*!
  This may be the ultimate logo font for Web 2.0! \r\n\r\nCheck it out\r\n\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=SHT0000043\r\n\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/download/pdf/softmachine.pdf
  \r\n\r\n( see page 4 on the PDF )\r\n\r\nCongradulations Nick!\r\n\r\n* I don't
  know if Notan is what he was thinking of at the time, but I think that's what i
  see happening."

    like this and Advert are spaced tightly, and may be designed for tight setting,
    but aren't designed specifically for outlining -- note how the angle of A and
    W are different, and the splayed legs of Advert's M.\r\nRound edges definitely
    help."

    meant for algorithmic outlining, but apparently it is meant to be layered, which
    is closely related, as can be seen in that illustration; and most significantly
    here, it's <cite>spaced</cite> to that end. One might even think that if they
    had OT back then it would have had contextual spacing as well. We <cite>are</cite>
    talking about Letterror - well, half of it, but that's still plenty.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Your point on the affinity of layering and outlining is well made.\r\n\r\nAdvert
    wasn't initially designed for layering, the Rough is a \"product extension\".
    It takes the basic letterforms, grunges them, and revises the metrics. But the
    process doesn't go the next step and revise the letter forms, which could have
    been done without OT. In fact, the combination r_t in the word \"Advert\" is a
    prime candidate for changing to look more consistgently \"outlined\" in layering.
    \r\n\r\nI had thought about a family for Softmachine, but decided that it's OK
    to be single, like Impact."

  body: "> the process doesn\u2019t go the next step and revise the letter forms\r\n\r\nIsn't
    that something any good type designer always does, even for basic designs? I would
    expect JvR to have done that (which of course is not to say it's not possible
    to disagree with his particular decisions). The interesting thing about Softmachine
    is that it makes this basic design principle contextual (which does require OT).
    This is something Eben has been talking about, although it's always nicer to see
    it actually hit the ground.\r\n\r\n> it\u2019s OK to be single\r\n\r\nFonts without
    italics, I actually admire - but a gradation of weights is quite useful in my
    mind - although to some extent Softmachine has that \"built-in\" (even though
    I worry about the effects of \"blind\" tracking to compensate for any weight gain
    via outlining). BTW, a really nice font with weights only is Stone's Silica:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/silica/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
