  body: Actually I must say I can't distinguish Bigg's work from Oliver's because
    I've always seen them as V23, so I wouldn't even know who did what exactly.

  body: V23 had a knack for unearthing obscure scripts and serif faces and combining
    them in such a way that even letterspaced Univers Condensed looked gorgeous. The
    integration of type with image always was very clever and the overall images usually
    of a profound poetic beauty. I see them as illustrators who used type beautifully
    in their work, so I couldn't care less if they broke some rules against kerning
    or letterspacing or alignment or whatever -- you have to judge the work within
    its context.

    typographic covers for the Pet Shop Boys and whose work was often marred by typos,
    double spaces and whatnot. Because his work completely relies on type setting,
    <em>then</em> I feel we are entitled to be extra critical about said typography.

  body: "Ok, after some more reading and consulting with those who were around for
    Oliver's peak, I think I'm gaining a better understanding of what makes him special.
    What I lacked was context. It sounds like his type certainly <em>was</em> original
    at the time and has since been copied by many. Like Yves said, no one used the
    antique scripts and stuff (deemed by a friend \"granny type\") until he did. He
    was doing something new. \r\n\r\nSo I sheepishly retract my notion that his work
    wasn't original. \r\n\r\nBut I still feel the type is lacking. It conveys the
    mood of the music and complements the imagery well, but the setting feels like
    an afterthought. Unrefined. It's clear that his strengths are in art direction
    and illustration. The advice of an experienced typographer might have made the
    work even better.\r\n\r\nI'm reminded of my feelings for Peter Saville, another
    \"mood\" designer. But I feel like Saville's work has a complexity and wit that's
    missing in some of these Oliver pieces."

  body: "Part of the context he was working in was punk. 23v was a graphic reaction
    away from the rough of punk but it wasn't such a clean break that some of the
    DIY spirit wasn't still there lingering. So being less than completely fussy about
    the type may have been natural especially early on. And with music I think looking
    to the immediate impact may be the greater virtue.\r\n\r\nHaving grown up with
    it like Tiff I probably don't see it objectively though either. I did love all
    the variation and expressiveness in the type and in the use of it."
