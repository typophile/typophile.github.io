  <BR>I know this message would probably be better suited in a different section but
  i just wanted to extend a very warm invitation for all of you to see my brand new
  font site. Mine is as far as i&#39;m concerned one of the first digital type foundries
  in my country and this is where i&#39;ll be showing a lifetime of type ideas. I
  would also really appreciate any feedback on my work and any comments.  <BR> <BR>A
  blink and a smile to you all from Mexico City! <BR> <BR>Roxy Fonts <BR>For the love
  of Type <BR><A HREF="http://www.roxyfonts.com" TARGET="_top">www.roxyfonts.com</A>
