  body: "1) I thought I'd try to do a text face influenced by the marks you might
    get with a fat marker pen. I never actually used a marker pen so it's kind of
    an imagined result. All the rounds from stems (b, d, p, q, r, m, n, a) have the
    same straight bit going to a curve.\r\n2) It barely has a roman, but it will have
    an italic at some point. I've got a new script font almost done then I might make
    this the next one I get round to, so it'll probably be in the critique section
    soon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cedion_6679.JPG]\r\nThat e needs
    some work!"

    something similar, but more ink-trap than blackletter (italic is all curves, though)."

  body: Omnibus Type's Chivo and Rosario have a 'u' resembling this if a lot more
    rounded. I think Vollkorn is in that ballpark as well.

  body: Not the exact form, but I'm sure you noted that the tail on Chivo's 'u' looks
    quite like the bottom curve. That's the similarity I saw, oh, and the raised tail
    in the others. ATM I recall none near that harsh form you drew.

    fiddled with the same concept on a number of experimentations in fontstruction)"
