  body: Brandee, <BR>It&#39;s definitely a font, but as we ought to have in a FAQ,
    hand-printed fonts are very easy and cheap to make. This means an advertiser can
    use anyones printing to have a font made, and no one else would be able to duplicate
    it. <BR> <BR>There are probably thousands of freeware fonts like this, for the
    same reason -- anyone can make them, or have them made for less than $10. <BR>
    <BR>ClickArt has a set of 300 Handwritten &#40;HW&#41; fonts &#40;now sold by
    Broderbund&#41;, and most foundries have a small scattering of hand-printed styles.
    <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html" target="_blank">Part 11
    of the Script Font ID Guide</a> shows all the HW fonts, and many of the other
    commercial ones, with a sampling of some of the freeware ones. You can probably
    find something that is at least similar to this, if you are willing to wade through
    about 24 web pages. It&#39;s probably the most complete collection you can see
    in one place, if I say so myself. <BR> <BR>Unless you get very lucky, picking
    something similar is your best bet to avoid spending a lot of time.
