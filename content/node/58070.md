body: "I'm working on some DVD packaging, but I'm sort of at a loss about what typeface
  captures the right spirit in the body text.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it needs to be really
  matter-of-fact, not too fancy but not clean either. Something that isn't going to
  be noticed too much, basically, but has a sort of slapped together, engineer-designed
  feel -- Clarendon came to mind, but I associate this too much with Starbucks & REI,
  and I don't like it for body copy.\r\n\r\nHere's the trailer for the movie -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCv9KUYbLCs\r\n\r\nSuggestions?
  Thanks!"
