  Logo]]\r\nI've searched on this forum, and there is a post long time ago that says
  that logo is handlettered, also searched on Myfonts, the forum says the same thing
  too.. When searched using the font search box, it shows Belinda by Mika Melvas..
  Just wondering if there's a typeface that is exactly or more similar to this logo
  that's available now? Thanks.. :)"
