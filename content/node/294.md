  symbols &#40;hereafter referred to as TM&#41; at the end of a sentence thusly: <BR>
  <BR>&#34;...so make your voice heard: call Acme.TM&#34; &#40;then kern the TM close
  to the period, rather than: <BR> <BR>&#34;...so make your voice heard: call AcmeTM.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>Was I duped? Comments? Is there a reference guide that may discuss this
  vexing issue? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>CP <BR>'

  body: The best reference is your own eye. What looks best? Which <BR>method conveys
    meaning without distraction? I usually <BR>kern the period so the &#34;TM&#34;
    is above the period and still <BR>close to the &#34;Acme&#34;. Crazy dedicated
    typographers do the <BR>same with quotes over periods.

  body: Cordpork -- I think that your way of doing things, all &#34;rules&#34; aside,
    would make for the most visually &#34;copasetic&#34; sentence.

  body: The logical rule would be to never break the symbol from the item for which
    it is the trademark. So perhaps my previous statement shows me as a designer and
    not a communicator. Hmm. So perhaps I&#39;ll modify that last statement.  Otherwise,
    it might look as if the period is part of that which is trademarked. <BR>

  body: 'I think it is incorrect to separate the &#153; from the  <BR>Acme with a
    period intervening. No matter what. The  <BR>implication in your approach &#40;both
    1 and 3 in your  <BR>example&#41; is that the entire sentence &#40;or at least
    the  <BR>clause &#34;call Acme&#34;&#41; is the trademark. <BR> <BR>I would set
    the sentence order as Acme&#153;., then  <BR>kern the period under the &#153;,
    but not so far as  <BR>your #3 example. This way, also, your text is not  <BR>&#34;broken&#34;
    when repurposed into an environment  <BR>without kerning. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    my opinion as a designer, typographer, and editor. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Crazy dedicated
    typographers do the  <BR>same with quotes over periods.</i> <BR> <BR>Crazy dedicated
    typographers who use well crafted  <BR>fonts shouldn&#39;t have to, as the quote-period
    kern pair  <BR>should be present in a good font. I also include kerns  <BR>for
    period-quote in my fonts. I have not, however,  <BR>heretofore built a kern pair
    for trademark-period.  <BR>But perhaps I will include it from here on out. &#40;And,  <BR>I
    suppose, period-trademark as well, just in case.&#41; <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

    of last week. KL, your comment makes me think of web environments, and you were
    probably even thinking the same thing.  <BR>.

  body: I am much less concerned with implying that a period or an entire sentence
    is part of the trademark than I am with that lonely period floating off by itself!  <BR>
    <BR>In general, I would pull the TM much closer to the word Acme than you have
    in any of the examples shown, CP. Then I would tuck the period in so that it would
    match any other e. combination. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m more concerned with the flow
    of the sentence as it is read. The TM is going to be ignored by the reader, so
    I try to make it as inconspicuous as possible while still meeting the legal requirements
    of the corporation. <BR> <BR>JMHO <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

    of building this into  <BR>the font is problematic. Such an extreme kern of the  <BR>period
    under the &#153; will pull the following spaceband  <BR>and subsequent letters
    up tight. This won&#39;t work.  <BR>&#40;Except maybe with an OT contextual table
    or something.&#41; <BR> <BR>I must admit that from a practical standpoint, setting  <BR>the
    period first is more effective. I still don&#39;t like the  <BR>idea of breaking
    the underlying text.  <BR> <BR>And I agree with Kristin, I&#39;d like to see the
    &#153; at  <BR>least as close to the preceding word as the period, so  <BR>that,
    if anything, they seem to occupy the same space,  <BR>with neither character before
    or after the other. <BR> <BR>My revised opinion. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>
