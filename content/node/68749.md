  body: Jenson is a really nice, classy lady. I think there might be a love match
    with muscle bound Meta, which has very beautiful numerals to accompany Jenson
    (if that's what you're looking for on a businesscard).

  body: "Meta is good looking but he's a little too muscular. I was thinking of staying
    on the light side.\r\n\r\nSo if title will be jenson pro light, the contact info
    shouldn't be bolder than the title correct?\r\n"

  body: BTW, I think that a light serif combined with a small, bolder sans can be
    very nice!

    looks like we went backwards and just went with it's own kind and stuck to Jenson
    all around. haha. \r\nSo much for speed dating. \r\n\r\nthanks"
