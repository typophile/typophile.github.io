body: "I'm in process of designing and redesigning glyphs but need some advices how
  to do spacing and kerning properly on non-serif font? Where in a font are a lot
  of letters \"same width\".\r\n\r\nWhat are test words, texts of you experienced
  technical fonts designers for spacing and kerning?\r\nHow to do easiest spacing
  and kerning on my font in Font Lab Studio?\r\nUsing classes? But what classes and
  letters actually in my font(look picture)?\r\n\r\nI tried auto kerning and I don't
  like results. I tried Optical metrics feature in Adobe programs and also not liked
  result. I want to do kerning properly and won't hesitate to do it manually, pair
  by pair. But how? From where to start? I tried by myself to do it but I see that
  moving some values in one part may make problem \"in other part\" of the font. So
  I can circle in that forever.\r\n\r\nBriem guide is for serif fonts I think, so
  Briem not helping here in my case.\r\n\r\n\r\nHelp me to make it right...\r\n\r\nI
  wanna make display, technical, geometrical and cargo font so I would like to see
  advices of font designers of that kind of fonts. I wanna make Latin 1 and Central
  European font for the start. Will add Cyrillic code pages later.\r\n\r\nhttp://i44.tinypic.com/2co1ncg.png\r\n\r\nEDIT:

    Once those are a balanced you can use these (or appx) values for all straights
    and rounds. For letterforms that deviate, try oooxoooxxxoooxnnnxxxnnn (where x
    = your letter).\r\n\r\nDo the same with caps, and small caps: starting with HHHHHHH
    and OOOOOO, but consider how they should relate to each other and the lowercase.\r\n\r\nPunctuation
    adds some other factors, but that\u2019s a huge topic -- too big for a single
    thread.\r\n\r\n"

    typeface. (Squint and compare evenness of grey.)\r\n\r\nAnd another thing: Don\u2019t
    touch the kerning until the spacing is perfect! If the spacing isn\u2019t solid,
    you\u2019ll end up going in circles as you already observed."

  body: "Ok good. thank you... but I wont design Italics (not now for sure), neither
    SmallCAPS. What you think... how would be going if I design Capitals, lowercases,
    special characters, in Regular size and later maybe I decide to add more font
    weights or Small CAPS or to design Italics for example... How would spacing and
    kerning been then? Would I suffer from some... for me as a beginner in font design,
    some \"invisible\" problem or not? Will spacing and kerning would be needed to
    be redone or I can do spacing and kerning for those \"new fonts\" with their design
    based on Regular weight of font?\r\n\r\nIn short, I wanna ask is it better to
    do my font with \"All\" (capitals, lowercases, SmallCAPS, Italics, Specials) or
    can do it separately in phases?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor now of this my font, I want to
    make:\r\n\r\n1 font weight as Regular, \r\nfont with all special characters and\r\nLatin
    1 and CE code pages and Later maybe will do Cyrillic code pages\r\nno italics,
    \r\nno smallCAPS."

    stage in the learning process\u2014if you continue to nurture your interest in
    type\u2014you\u2019ll probably do the spacing and kerning all over again a bunch
    of times anyway. You learn so much as you go in this trade. In any case, a good
    fundament (=even spacing) is much better to build on then a bad one."

    till now. 3 times I had my data crash and 4th time I started from \"zero\" I had
    just 1 saved image of my typefaces and  using that I recreated my font and did
    it for few months in Adobe Illustrator CS. Then I posted here with questions \"how
    to do it?\" and I did Latin1 & 2 sets. My font geometry was easy so I spent less
    time on that, that's true. You can see my forum posts from year or two ago abt
    my font so idk why you upset then.\r\n\r\nFont Lab make metrics and kerning now
    easier to complete and that's really time saving. Already to sell fonts is hard
    and give small profit but I like fonts creating.\r\n\r\nSo how I see contemporary
    trend going on side of easier font creating process. Which is awesome in my opinion.\r\n\r\nGive
    me please, metrics and kerning sets to do Cyrillic letters right. This going offtopic."

    you're not in with the in crowd\u2026which I apparently am not. However, I can
    suggest that you do what I did when I needed some test material for languages
    unknown to me: find some web pages with your target language, then copy and paste
    them into a Word document.\r\n\r\nIf Cyrillic-based languages follow the same
    basic rules as letter distribution in English, this approach should cover a number
    of the more common kerning pairs.\r\n\r\nP.S. \"this guy\" is, IMHO, not unlike
    a hack...but a well-respected one, it would appear. I reworked over 300 of my
    own fonts in less than half the time, but he rules, dude."

    many of us have experienced in person) and that naturally generates goodwill.
    That said, I know it's hard to be nice when things haven't been going one's way.\r\n\r\nNow,
    Branislav actually does seem like a nice guy, but if some people are wary of giving

    based on precedent (a powerful thing).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
