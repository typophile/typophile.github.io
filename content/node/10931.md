body: 'Ive decided I need to set up some sort of testing routine. At the minute Im
  looking at testing on OS9/X/Win98/XP, Flash, Distiller, Postscript print test from
  Quark Xpress. Have you any other suggestions? Also I notice Microsoft have a font
  validator app on their site: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/validator/"
  target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/validator/</a> <BR>
  <BR>Is this reliable enough to skip full Win98/XP testing? Are there any other similar
  utilities out there, or any for Mac OSX?'

  body: The MS Font Validator is an excellent tool for testing TT and OT fonts. I
    recommend using it not only for final font testing but also during production
    to catch little bugs that might otherwise slip by. In particular, I recommend
    running the Font Validator on a test font <i>before hinting</i>. Few things in
    font development are more annoying than finishing hinting a glyph only to discover
    that you have an invisible overlapping stem, correcting which will delete your
    hinting. <BR> <BR>In some respects the Font Validator is better than simply testing
    fonts for normal behaviour in apps, since there are plenty of bugs that may not
    reveal themselves in app behaviour. The Font Validator checks your font against
    the spec. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I still recommend doing an install and print
    test. <BR> <BR>One thing you may find when testing FontLab generated fonts in
    the Font Validator is that you get a lot of error reports for the LTSH, HDMX and
    VDMX tables. This is due to a difference between FontLab&#39;s calculated values
    for these tables and the actual values reported back from the system rasteriser.
    You can fix these problems by downloading Microsoft&#39;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/tools.htm">CacheTT</a>
    and then selecting the FontLab option &#39;Use CacheTT program to generate device
    metrics tables in TT fonts&#39;. This will run your fonts through CacheTT as part
    of the FL font generation, and will overwrite the FL calculated values.

  body: testings with various software is important, because none of them use same
    method to handle namings, display, etc. <BR>Word <BR>Quark <BR>Indesign <BR>Illustrator/Freehand/Photoshop
    <BR>AppleWork <BR>Filemaker <BR>Flash <BR> <BR>then, try some pdf <BR>print on
    Laserprinter with true PS, and emulated PS, <BR>and on jet printers <BR> <BR>Install
    via system <BR>via ATM, Suitcases, FontReserve depending wich platform you are.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure I miss some! <BR> <BR>

  body: I&#39;ve not yet found any functional bugs &#40;i.e. things that prevent the
    fonts from installing, rasterising and printing&#41; if FontLab-generated LTSH,
    HDMX and VDMX errors are not corrected. In fact, in one font I worked on we were
    obliged to maintain the VDMX errors in order to ensure backwards compatibility
    with earlier versions of the font. <BR> <BR>If you do have a chance to fix these
    errors, i.e. if you have not released fonts or do not need to worry about backwards
    compatibility, then I think you should. Although the fonts will work okay with
    these errors, there will be discrepancy, e.g. in default linespacing, between
    fonts with correct and incorrect values. <BR> <BR>Apart from anything else, being
    able to confirm that tables in your font conform to the TT/OT spec can save you
    from a lot of customer support hassles. <BR> <BR>I presume that FontLab on Mac
    makes the same calculation errors, and I&#39;m not sure how to fix the problem
    without CacheTT, which is only available for Windows.

  body: As Im on OS X I cant use CacheTT or MS Font Validator so I will stick with
    manual testing. Jean, when you say emulated PS do you mean using the Virtual Printer
    option in Mac OS or printers that are not true PS? <BR> <BR>As for having other
    people test my fonts, I have considered havng a list of Beta testers, but Im not
    sure if its a good idea or not. Any thoughts?
