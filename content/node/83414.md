  looks a lot like the the free \"Deftones Stylus\" font at first sight, but when
  you look closely it don't. It looks a lot more pro.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "I think you're right that they share a strong resemblance. My thought was
    that Ray Larabie might have modeled his font on the Harley logo, but I don't know
    how old the logo is. The font was designed in 1999. If the font came before the
    logo, the obvious answer is that the logo was a customization of the font, or
    at least inspired by it.\r\n\r\nWe need a Harley fan to tell us when that logo
    appeared.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
