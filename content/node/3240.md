  body: I guess indeed <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/friz-quadrata/bold-italic/testdrive.html?s=KFC&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> this</a> is about the closest you&#39;ll get  <BR>using an existing
    typeface. Logos of big companies  <BR>usually are custom designed, Michelle. It
    prevents  <BR>misappropriation and lends the logo its uniqueness. <BR> <BR>If
    you stretch the characters a bit and insert the  <BR>inline yourself you can approximate
    the logo.
