body: I was just looking for some feedback on a poster l created for a friends music
  night.  The night is called Sprawl, so l created a font based on patterns of urban
  sprawl.  The poster is A3,urrr the font only works for a high point size.

  body: "Kris is right that deserves some positive comment, that font/image reminds
    me of the maps created by tracking ants searching for food that I saw somewhere
    recently, with the bewildered/lone-wolf ants wandering off track. Overall a strong
    poster coupled with an intriguing image.\r\nTim"

    anything about it; the built-up linework stands out and draws you in. I also like
    the treatment of type in tightly ordered bands. Nice one!\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: I don't see the connection to sprawl per se - but the poster is very very
    nice indeed - and matches electronic music quite nicely! Congrats!

    same typeface with different combinations of weights, spaces. Formally, I ask
    how do you get thicks and thins in there? A serif used in the right places could
    be cool. Cheers.. love what you've done."
