  typographic (partly graphic design) project. I need to redesign ugly looking statements
  and invoices. Do books or websites/blogs exist covering this field? Who are the
  big names and experts? Any help is appreciated."

    a voluminous book about the sometimes boring art of designing forms, compiled
    by Borries Schwesinger, called <a href=\"http://www.planb2.de/en/index.htm\">Formulare
    gestalten</a>. Schwesinger has been awarded with several prices for the lovely
    design."

    of the services they are paying the bank for, I'd say no such book exists.

  body: 'I''m not sure about invoices and statements specifically but perhaps you
    could draw some inspiration from a book by Marcia Lausen called "Design for Democracy:Ballot
    and Election Design". She re-designed much of the messed up ballot forms that
    in 2000 could have resulted in a Gore presidency. '

  body: "designing forms and statements is essencially information design. \r\n\r\nRead
    about that. There are big names who do Iformation design. \r\n\r\nHere the functionality
    is more important than the appearance, but at the same time, if you come up with
    a functional (easy to follow, intuitive & readable) form or statement that doesn't
    put people to sleep or have them pulling their hair out, it will, coincidentally,
    be also be attractive, becuase of its tidy simple functionality. \r\n\r\n'least
    that's what I think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
