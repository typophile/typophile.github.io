    emoticon next to my statement about form fitting content... I was joking, and
    I was talking about Led Zeppelin, not Shepard Fairey!\r\n\r\nBut seriously, folks...
    Shepard Fairey has a recognizable visual style... So do a lot of other artists
    and designers. And the band Led Zeppelin have a number of recognizable visual
    tropes: the burning Hindenburg they used on their first album cover, the C.R.
    Mackintosh lettering they started using in 1973, the four symbols they used on
    their so-called \"Zoso\" album... So why wouldn't they use all of this stuff for
    a compilation package?"

    say -- he makes ironic comments but doesn't bother to add a winking emoticon!
    Gets him into trouble sometimes.  :-D\r\n\r\nI've thought some more about the
    cover art... It's kind of surprising that Zeppelin didn't go with their usual
    designer, (ex-Hipgnosis partner) Storm Thorgerson. If I were very cynical I would
    guess that they chose Shepard Fairey as a way to appeal to a younger audience,
    but who knows?"
