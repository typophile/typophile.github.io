  body: "Thanks Jan. Just passed it through and didn't even look at it. Great lowercase
    but uppercase and numbers have some quirks that I don't like.\r\n\r\nAny alternatives?
    Similar typographies?\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nSandro"

    version, Geometric 706</a>, like all Bitstream versions slightly different from,
    eh, other versions. Furthermore you could check <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/\">this

  body: "A fusion of Futura and Akzidenz Grotesk is probably not what Bloemsma had
    in mind when designing Balance.\r\n;-)\r\n\r\nDid you check the list? FF Bau,
    FF Schulbuch or FF Super Grotesk (for that extra touch of Futura) might fit the
    bill."

  body: "Neuzeit S has something like fusion of Futura and Akzidenz Grotesk that I
    really like. \r\nJust that I can't get past that G,J and number 3. \r\n\r\nI think
    that even FF Balance could get into this category just it has more humanist, dutch
    feel.\r\n\r\np.s. I am creating a logotype for construction and engineering company.

  body: "Too much futura in them. Of course that was not Bloemsma intention but in
    proportion, it has certain feel that goes in that direction just in a humanist
    way. \r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nSandro"
