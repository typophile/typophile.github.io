<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>After following the En-Em Dash debates (http://typophile.com/node/30372) I have a question of my own.
<strong>When using the backslash in a sentence, what is the acceptable (English) usage?</strong>
This is a problem that has plagued me for sometime now, but never enough to illicit proper research. Hopefully you fine folks can help.
1. No spacing:
The work around utilized by eRMS operators was to <strong>Reverse/Cancel</strong> Shipping Document…
2. Spacing on both sides of the backslash:
The work around utilized by eRMS operators was to <strong>Reverse / Cancel</strong> Shipping Document…
3. Spacing after the backslash:
The work around utilized by eRMS operators was to <strong>Reverse/ Cancel</strong> Shipping Document…

<div class=commentbody>I was always taught that you don't put any spaces around the slash unless it's separating poetry lines or song lyrics, but I don't have any style manuals handy at the moment.
BTW, this: / - is a slash and this: \ - is a backslash.

<div class=commentbody><em>Chicago</em> refers to it as the solidus (also known as the slash, slant, or virgule) and suggests the same spacing rules apply to it as to the em- and en-dash, i.e., no spacing.
I've been known to bend that one on rare occasions, depending on the font -- setting something in italic with a slash might want one (thin, actually, in retrospect) space after, but it's not usual. Spacing on both sides cancels out the whole purpose of putting the slash there in the first place, because it indicates an alternative choice. My copy of <em>Chicago</em> has several such examples, all set tight.
At least here in North America: elsewhere, mileage/kilometrage varies.... ;-)

<div class=commentbody>(Gawd, I love questions like this!)
Interestingly enough, <em>APA </em>(The American Psychological Association) <em>Manual </em>calls it a "slash, also called a virgule, solidus, or shill" but has some considerable differences in use from <em>Chicago</em>.
<em>APA</em> warns against use in <em>and/or</em> constructions (they want a phrase instead), simple comparisons (they want a hyphen), or "more than once to express compound units" (where they want centered dots and parens).
<em>The New York Public Library of Style</em> has even more names for "slash" -- virgule, cancel, shilling, diagonal, slant bar, stroke, solidus, and (my personal favourite) separatrix.
<em>Words Into Type</em> says that separatrix is used in bibliographical matter to indicate where one line ends and another begins (this is also a function in setting poetry continuously).
And last, but not least, the second edition of <em>Editing Canadian English</em> lists it in the index as "solidus."
Whew! ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just had a gander at <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>, which refers to it simply as a <em>virgule</em>.

<div class=commentbody>Finally, I'm at peace. Thank you all very much.
Not only has my question been answered, but I have been corrected in what type of slash it was <em> (Lex and Conor) </em> also, I thought it was called a backslash because it was tilted towards the rear.

<div class=commentbody>Andrew, I don't know if you have any editorial say in this, but Bryan Garner--a very condensed version of whose <em>Modern American Usage</em> appears in <em>CMS</em> 15/e--would say that if you really mean "or," write "or," or pick one or the other: "reverse" or "cancel." Hence, your virgule/separatrix/etc. problem goes away.
Garner would probably also say that the verb for "to draw out" or "provoke" is <em>elicit</em>, but I recognize the gratuity of my pointing that out.
Also--to make my post even more gratuitous--when people mean "use," why can't they <em>write</em> "use," and not "utilize," a three-syllable word than means nothing more or less than "use"?</div>

???
Is one of those wrong? Are they both wrong?</em>
(putting on my editor hat)
The former is my pick of the two.
That being said, it is awkward to see it written, and is phrased more as a rhetorical question (I keep expecting to see "doesn't there?" at the end). IMHO, it should be rewritten as
"There are many grammar-centric questions on Typophile."
OTOH, I don't have a problem in people writing here as they talk, and certainly the rhetorical question format is much more conversational and colloquial.
And thus endeth the grammar lesson for today.... ;-)
(taking off my editor hat)
There are days when it's useful to have one foot in the typography/design camp and the other in the anal-retentive editor camp, I guess.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Lari, I think I'd define grammar-centric more as "centred around grammar": grammatical means "conforming to the rules of grammar."
I'd like to think we're doing the former while discussing the latter. ;-)</div>

Just so long as it's not one like Oedipus.... ;-)
The practices of "grammar" and "typography" have almost too many similarities: I've always thought of them as being opposite sides of the same street, to skew Tiff's analogy a bit.
(Probably the two most important is that they both require an eagle-eye for detail, and it's essential to know the rules so you can break them when a situation calls for it.)
In the thirty-plus years I've spent working with both, I've often been asked which one I prefer, and the answer's always been "I can't pick just one." I consider myself very lucky that I've always been able to make a (relatively) good living by doing them at the same time.
(And for my next philosophical discourse, we'll look at the jokes of Ludwig Wittgenstein....) ;-)</div>

There do seem to be a lot of grammar-centric questions on Typophile.</cite>
Speaking as an editor, each of those sentences could be correct for a particular meaning: if the "lot" were an actual thing, like in the sense of "the items on sale in the auction were grouped into twenty lots", the singular verb would be correct, but if "a lot of" were used as a synonym for "many" without any implication of the existence of actual lots, then the plural verb would be preferable. I think the latter is what is meant here.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Grot Esqué on this one, and I suppose it is similar to my views on the en-dash as well. No spaces if you are contrasting two words (yes/no) but spaces if you are contrasting phrases (not today / no comment).
Where I tend to use it most is for event listings:
Mon/Tue/Thu
or
4 February / 5 March
And if a grammarwiki was started it would be my number 1 bookmark.

<div class=commentbody>So, if the backslash is on all our keyboards, is there something useful we might do with it? The backslash is slowly losing it's role in file management, and it would be a shame for it to just atrophy. The "|" has some decorative use, I've started on getting the ascii tilde some play, but I'm totally open to getting to 'own' another key on my 'board!

Ricardo, any editor worth their salt carries a range of whips, uh, red pencils, with them for just such a purpose. ;-)
Lari, in a situation like that, and assuming I was visiting both, I'd write <em>I'm going to North America and South America.</em> Sometimes, using a conjunction is a better solution to using a punctuation mark.... ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>In the absense of "either", "or" can be taken to imply the inclusive sense, but "and/or" makes that intent less ambiguous. The exclusive "or", however your preferred programming language puts it, is analogous to a phrase like "either <em>x</em> or <em>y</em>".
