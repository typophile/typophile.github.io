body: "Hi there, I'm new to the forum, and I thought I'd post this question.  I cannot
  seem to find a solution.\r\n\r\nI've created my first font with Fontlab 5 for PC.
  \ It's based off another font and my only goal was to make a grungy version of it
  to test.  \r\n\r\nWhen I try to type with it, it seems fine until I type a lowercase
  \"f\" followed by an \"i\" or an \"l\".  When I do that it deletes all the characters
  that I typed before it.  It's VERY bizzare.  Anyone else have this problem?  \r\n\r\nEdit:
  I tried typing in Wordpad, which everything seems fine.  It's just when I'm typing
  in Illustrator it deletes characters. And in Photoshop the character doesn't show
  up and any following characters I type after the \"fl\" or \"fi\" do not show up
  either.  I'm frustrated.  Can anyone help?"

  body: it sounds like Adobe applications are looking for 'fi' and 'fl' ligatures
    that don't exist in the font, or that DO exist, but have not been designed. a
    simple way to resolve this issue would be 1) to disable auto ligature replacement
    in the application, or 2) add these ligatures to your font.

    body: Ok I added glyphs for "fi" and "fl" but it still has the same problem. How
      do I make them actual ligatures.  I'm not sure how to do that.

    thought font making would be easy, but it's harder than I thought!

    and hundreds of glyphs for broad language support."
