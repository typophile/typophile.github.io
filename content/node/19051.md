body: "i'm trying to generate an open type font file, and fontlab keeps hanging up
  on me. the same file worked fine before i merged all of my contours. so now i have
  nice clean simplified outlines (presumably) but can't make an OT font. i am able
  to generate OT files from other vfb files.\r\n\r\ni also tried to generate a mac
  suitcase, which seems successful. but indesign says the outline is not available
  for the installed font.\r\n\r\nwhat am i missing here? the only thing i can somewhat
  pinpoint is that the paths may be corrupted somehow from when they were 'simplified'. "

  body: Check to see you have no paths where there are two BCPS at the same position
    -- indicated by the point being "open". Squeeze that zit.

  body: 'nick -- thanks for the input. i looked at each glyph and don''t see any stray
    points or unclosed paths. i turned on ''font audit'' which only indicated a few
    flat spots. are there any other tools or methods for checking my outlines? i understand
    that once a path is closed, the shape becomes a black fill, at least with how
    my preferences are set. '

  body: "I'm just passing on a similar problem I had that was solved by replacing
    a corrupt outline.\r\nI discovered it by a process of trial and error, by deleting
    half the glyphs in the font and seeing if it would compile, and so on. Another
    thing you can do is go round each path \"next point\" at a time, and if you click
    and there's no movement, then you know there is a double-point. All this is assuming
    that a corrupt path somewhere is the source of your difficulty, and not something
    else!"

    you do not mention this, you must give your font a name. FontLab  will not warn
    of this and give an error in return...   '

  body: reg, it definitely has all the naming info -- i <i>am</i> able to export a
    few characters, but that is it. nick, i tried your method of deleting characters
    until it exports. the problem is totally random it seems. i have successfuly exported
    up to about 15 glyphs, but i can also export with basically any single glyph left
    in the set. for instance, if i delete everything except the 'a', i can export.
    if i delete everything but the 'b', same deal. it can't be a memory issue -- i
    have over a gig of ram, and have quit all other programs. arg!

    and copy your glyphs in to a new vfb file. See if that works.\r\nThe import the
    metrics.\r\n\r\nOh, and you need more than just the kern feature.\r\n\r\n"
