  try again...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Takashimaya Sample_6125.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  is the logotype from one of the large department stores here in Japan, Takashimaya
  (I am always seeing this one as it is my wife's favourite department store here!
  This one from a bag of rye bread).\r\n\r\nI am curious to know whether it is a font
  or custom lettering?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGrant"

    unless commissioned by head office.\r\nHere is info from \"Changes in logos and
    trademarks in Japan\":\r\n\r\nThe trademark with the Chinese character TAKA in
    a circle, the identical character when seen from the front or behind.\r\n\r\nversion
    of circle-mark shown from 1886\r\n\r\nThe mark registered in 1904. In 1968, the
    prototype of the mark was established to avoid distorted shapes by branches."

  body: "Thanks Userone for that info.\r\n\r\nIt is a great logo and the type works
    really well, I just wish they would use it more. Their website and other print
    materials use a lot of other display fonts none of which are as characteristic
    as the logo.\r\n\r\nWhenever I saw the logo and type it reminded me of Alex Scholing's
    'Engine' & 'Roice' fonts for FontFont. Similar qualities but very different."

  body: "The typeface used looks a lot like a fat version of <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_s/stymie_hairline_full.gif\">ITC
    Stymie Hairline</a>, which had the same single-storey 'a' and serif on the 'y'.
    (I don't think this font is sold any more. I made this sample from an old Image
    Club font.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
