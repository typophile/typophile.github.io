  body: "X/Y size values are scale factors relative to the em. e.g. a value of 700
    on a font that is on a 1000-unit em would result in characters scaled to 7/10
    size.\r\n\r\nY pos values are relative to the baseline; for subscript, positive
    values move *downward* from the baseline.\r\n\r\nNormally leave X pos values at
    zero except for italics, where you generally want to calculate along the italic
    angle.\r\n\r\nMore detailed info on these settings at http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#subxs\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for that.\r\n\r\nI'm still slightly confused as to the factor I should
    use.  I am using a UPM of 1000.  The ascender height of the subscript is 541 and
    the x height is 394\r\n\r\nWhat should this work out to????\r\n"

  body: Since these values only control the "fake" super/subscripts, the easiest thing
    to do is include real super and subscript glyphs and control their behavior with
    some OpenType programming. Then ignore these values (leave them as is as a default).

  body: "While it's true that these control the \"fake\" super/subs, many apps and
    operating systems *still* don't support super/subs via OpenType. So the best thing
    to do is at least take a decent whack at setting these values. At minimum, try
    to test in apps that use them (e.g. MS Word) and verify that the defaults are
    giving reasonable results.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the specifics:\r\nThe X/Y size values
    represent a scale factor. Since X and Y are separated, this allows you to scale
    the width differently than the height, which you might want to do to give more
    weight to the stems, rather than just a straight scale. To figure out the values
    to use, look at your real, designed sups/subs, and calculate what percentage they
    are of the original (i.e. \"zero superior is 65% of the size of the normal zero\",
    use 650 for the size).\r\n\r\nPer the spec: the Y pos (\"offset\") values \"specif[y]
    a font designer's recommended vertical offset from the character baseline to the
    character baseline for subscript characters\". So, work out where you want the
    baseline of the superscripts to be, relative to the normal baseline of the font,
    in em units, and enter that value. For example, if the superscript baseline is
    at 400 units above the normal baseline, enter 400. The only slightly odd thing
    as I mentioned above is that + values mean \"down\" for Y subscript pos...so if
    the subscript baseline is at -300, you'd just use 300 for that value.\r\n\r\nThe
    X pos values are used for italics, to control positioning along the italic angle.
    You can use some simple trigonometry to calculate that (using the Y pos value
    + italic angle).\r\n\r\n"
