But that doesn't mean I can believe there are none. For example, isn't &quot;coding&quot; broad a rule? Sure, it can be broken, but that's true in any field.

But typography is different because of its abstraction - like &quot;default&quot; spacing; while lettering is different because of its contextualization - like doing something special when you have an &quot;LA&quot; sequence (although increasingly typography is engulfing this). And what lettering and calligraphy share (which typography doesn't have) is that the forms are &quot;heuristic&quot;, not predetermined*. Calligraphy and typography share very little. And there's something else: of the three, only typography can be truly immersive, the other two are essentially display-centric (although in some instances -like a well-penned manuscript- it's hard to see that). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* &quot;Random&quot; fonts are deceptive - because of what Johnny von Neumann said. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; do you think a typographer can become better in typography after seeing graffiti? and vice versa?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">But Hrant, all early tyeface designs were based upon calligraphy. I've heard some historians claim that all type had origins in calligraphic forms well up until Bodoni really abstracted the forms toward a new direction of what design has become with the early moderns. Garamond is obviously based upon calligraphic forms. Transitional faces became more intelectualized maybe but the forms still have root in the way one writes a Latin majuscle and all italics of this period are based in humnist miniscule. Surely you can't deny a link, even if we have ventured farther from it as time has gone on.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not only is calligraphy (better: &quot;chirography&quot;) at the source of virtually all historic type designs, it's still the largest &quot;school of thought&quot; in contemporary type design! I'm certainly not denying its relevance (and usefulness in terms of formal analysis), but I do think that in the realm of theory the actual overlap is minimal.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I am sorry to disappoint you. But I wasn't leading you on or anything. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just think that most people benefit more when a person uses his abilities to improve communication between others (like in typography) than when he merely shares his personal expressions (like painting his name on a wall). But if a graffiti artist lends his skills to expressing some important social commentary, then I personally think that's great. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, I do believe that Art is an integral part of life, and no human can or should try to supress his expression, but when that becomes the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->objective<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the world gains very little.

On the other hand, people have different natures, and you can't force somebody to be very useful to many other people, at least not without making him miserable - and misery is contagious. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Legibility does not equal communication.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course.

In fact, it's the opposite of typography! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As many people have pointed out in the thread (Alessandro most  eloquently) they are differsnt &ndash; graffiti is more like WORDMARKS and LOGOs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typographic design is about a system of glyphs that can be combined in different sequences. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Calligraphy has this in common with type: both used for long text.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You would be more accurate to claim that graffiti is a peak in PAINTING's history &ndash; it's more Jackson Pollock than Matthew Carter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, I can imagine that in the future, digital type could enable more fluid, bio-mimetic forms of expression which would bring it closer to graffiti, and allow for that influence.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For instance, Frank Jonen's type with &quot;bit depth&quot;, enabling the tonal variety of calligraphy, fused with some kind of LettError datastream-driven Knuth meta-font, could better capture the vitality of graffiti, which is presently killed by the media at the typographer's disposal.</div>
