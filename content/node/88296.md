  concerned with traditional medial casing: Is it necessary to indicate this somehow?
  Is there a common Irish precedent?\r\n\r\nI'm tending to think it's okay to set
  the whole name in the same small caps, without making any distinctions."

    that the petite caps in FF Ernestine don't exactly line up with the x-line (as
    I've heard some people define petite caps to do) \u2013 they're slightly above.
    Lining them up with the x-line just made them way too tiny. They're basically

    you used to petite caps (a second, smaller set of small caps) is very good and
    help people to understand this still obscure resource.\r\n\r\nHrant, I'm not sure
    if petite caps slight taller than x-height would produce enough distinguishability
    from the lowercase to easily identify a pluralized acronym. Maybe it would achieve
    better results in fonts with small x-height (like Mrs. Eaves) than a project like
    mine \u2013where the somewhat large x-height does not let much room to play with
    petite height ([[http://www.if.pro.br/PC01.png|sample]]).\r\n\r\nAnyway, this
    is a nice approach to reduce the problem of pluralized acronyms. In my professional
    area this is one of the worst issues as there are lots of legal acronyms and many
    admit plural form."

    the petite caps are a little bit taller than the lc, but maybe the difference

  body: "Pluralizing an acronym? I have <em>seen</em> acronyms typeset in small caps,
    but that only in British typesetting, not American.\r\n\r\nPetite caps are an
    interesting idea. If small caps are visibly larger than the x-height, lower case
    could be used when something \"smaller\" has to be mixed with small caps. Although
    I admit that might not produce the desired result. And \"petite caps\" are obviously
    to be preferred over just mixing point sizes.\r\n\r\nBut the thing is, of course,
    that \"petite caps\" are <em>nonstandard</em>. So word processors wouldn't have
    a conventional way to handle them (as if most of them could handle small caps,
    of course, but they <em>should</em>).\r\n\r\nIf I was doing an Irish telephone
    directory, of course, I wouldn't paint myself into a corner by doing the names
    in small caps in the first place. I'd use regular caps (in a smaller size, with
    leading) and then use small caps where the petite would have been used for that
    particular visual effect.\r\n\r\nAnd this suggests a thought. What are small caps
    <em>for</em>? If you need to mix lower-case with small caps, or petite caps with
    small caps, perhaps you shouldn't be using small caps in the first place. If you
    need the full corpus of typographical resources, use a smaller type size - that
    will have a matching lowercase and a matching small caps.\r\n\r\nThe advantage
    of this is due to the fact that small caps are heavier and wider than normal caps
    of the same size. So a corresponding lower case would have to be wide enough to
    have problems, at least with some typefaces. The petite caps presumably would
    be just smaller, not heavier and wider still, only partaking in the heaviness
    and width of the small caps, so they manage well enough.\r\n\r\nThis is starting
    to suggest, if not infinite regress, at least something daunting.\r\n\r\nUpper
    case.\r\nLower case.\r\nSmall capitals.\r\n\r\nReduced upper case (X% of cap height,
    scaled down)\r\nReduced lower case (X% of the size of lower-case)\r\n\r\nPetite
    caps. (X% of small capitals, scaled down)\r\n\r\nSo one can choose to use upper
    case, lower case, and small capitals - with petite caps used within the small
    capitals - <strong>or</strong> one can use upper case, lower case, and reduced
    upper case - with <em>both</em> petite caps and reduced lower case available for
    use with the reduced upper case.\r\n\r\nSo \"X%\" would be the proportion of x-height
    to small cap height from this logic.\r\n\r\nAnd the \"reduced caps\" could still
    be somewhat heavier and wider than caps, rather than being merely scaled down
    - just not so much so as the regular small caps, so that a coherent lower case
    could accompany them."

    Nice. Besides GmbH, the Italian SpA is also a possible use.\r\n\r\nQuadibloc,
    acronyms with plural are quite common. The SUVs example Nina used is almost global

    Set proper names. In some areas and cultures it's usual to detach with UC/SC the
    name of a relevant author. Indexes and bibliographical lists also adopt this with
    some frequency.\r\n\r\n<strong>05</strong>. Achieve another level of subtitle
