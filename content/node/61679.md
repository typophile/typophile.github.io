body: "dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to study at the Reading MATD in a few
  weeks and started my first warmup research-exercise:\r\n\r\nI stated this exercise
  with a quesion of mixing one-storied and two-storied g\u2019s and a\u2019s in one
  font and how this decision can affect the delivered impression. What are the reasons
  and arguments to decide which forms to use and what kinds of problems would you
  associate with this question? In which context does one form make sense and in what
  context the other?\r\n\r\nI know my question is quite general in the moment but
  nevertheless I would appreciate any hint concerning:\r\n\r\n> examples of typefaces
  which provide alternatives (both styles)\r\n> historical background about the one-
  and two-storied forms\r\n> any rules or conventions in which one style should be
  used\r\n> connotations/denotations for the single characters\r\n> ...advices which
  I\u2019m not able to think of by now\r\n\r\nthanks a lot!\r\nnicole\r\n\r\nPS are
  there any serif-fonts with one-storied a or g? Or fonts with double-storied a but
  one-storied g (which is more unusual than the opposite)?\r\n\r\nPPS some examples\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nr1_4646.png]\r\nnumber
  one from darden studio \u2013 the font jubilat offers geometric and traditional
  characters (as they call it). this refers to the understanding I had: two-storied
  letters are more formal and typographic, one-storied letters are more modern and
  constructed on one hand but written on the other, which is a bit paradox ...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nr2_3884.png]\r\nthe
  second example shows an attempt to include both forms of g and a into one font to
  offer solutions for different purposes (e.g. text versus signage). this example
  came with the question in the beginning.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/utility_basic_4055.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/utility_stylisticset1_3875.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/utility_stylisticset2_5726.png]\r\n\r\nand
  these pictures of ff utility (basic forms and two stylistic sets) bring up the question:
  is it going to be standard to offer both/more forms in sans serif fonts ...? or
  is it just to use provided possibilities of layout-programms...\r\n"

    the way, \u2018guidance\u2019 is a good test word for this because it puts the
    d and a next to each other. One of the things I note about single-storey a is
    that the counter and bowl always appear slightly larger than that of d if actually
    the same size. In Gabriola, and in italic fonts, I optically compensate by making
    the a slightly narrower than the d."

  body: "thank you for all those exampes !\r\n\r\nbut may I also ask for your opinion
    (as probably more expierenced type-designer and/or type-user): is it useful to
    have these alternatives? for which kind of effect could it be useful? when do
    you think does it make sense?\r\n\r\nthe explanation of the features of trilby
    calls the single-storied version \u2018schoolbook-version\u2019 (some of your
    other suggestions lead into this direction as well). it covers connotations like
    simpleness and reduction and this fits to the context of this geometric, constructed
    style.\r\n\r\ndo you know about other purposes for which the double- or one-storied
    variants are typical? (like: one-storied for reading from distances, two-storied
    for text-sizes ...just a guess)\r\n\r\nnicole\r\n"

  body: 'Personally, I don''t think these variants are generally useful. In effect,
    they are mixing different styles of lettering within a single typeface, so the
    question should be in what circumstances is this desirable or useful. Gabriola
    is a hybrid typeface by design, intended to be able to support this kind of variation
    by providing a base design that combines elements of formal and cursive lettering,
    such that it can be pushed in either direction by the use of different variant
    sets. But single-storey letters in the context of roman types always seems weird
    to me, like a woman in an evening gown wearing combat boots. There''s nothing
    wrong with combat boots: they just belong with a different style of dressing.'

    single for headings.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Para_3462.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW
