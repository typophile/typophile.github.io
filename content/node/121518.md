  know which Sans Serif types are the ones in question! Best would be something with
  the same large x-height as the numerals, so they work together, Any ideas?\r\n\r\n"

    to substitute a capital |I| for the |1|:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/basic-commercial-lt/\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    not finding any sans serifs of that era with a plain |1| and a |9| in that style...which
    isn\u2019t to say that someone else can\u2019t suggest something.\r\n\r\nAlternate

  body: Thanks kthomps5, I was thinking maybe something in the world of Sackers Gothic
    (but not that), and for CANADA, I think the character that's interesting is the
    almost-closed-up capital C, does anyone have any ideas?

  body: "Edited:\r\nThe almost closed capital _C_ is a feature of a font known simply
    as Grotesque dating from 1832 that was still in use at the time of the 1928 Olympics
    when various weights and sizes were available. There is a close match in the letterforms
    of Stephenson Blake's Grotesque No. 9, which has been digitized, without providence
    information, by URW  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/GrotesqueNo9asCANADA_4624.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/grotesque-no-9/\r\nThe Monotype Corporations's
    Headline Bold, which has also been digitized,  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HeadlineBoldAsCanada_4168.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/headline-mt/ closely follows Stephenson Blake's
    Grotesque No. 9 but is slightly less condensed.\r\nThe lettering is probably a
    lighter weight sister font sold as Montotype Grotesque Condensed No.4. I did not
    spot an exact digital version but  Montotype Grotesque Extra Condensed [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MontotypeGrotesqueExtraCondensedAsCanada_5361.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/grotesque-mt/ might work, despite being a little
    too light. The digital font is based on Monotype's update of it's various Grotesque
    fonts by F.H. Pierpont in 1926. The series has interesting variations in details
    between various weights and widths.\r\nDon"
