  body: "It looks as if they still have the [[http://ephemeralnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/lenoxloungesign.jpg|original
    sign from the '20s or '30s.]] It is quite unusual even within this genre of art
    deco lettering.\r\n\r\nI say not a typeface. Search under art deco on myfonts
    and you might find something that could be tweaked to fit. It could have been
    a custom made sign or they could have been stock letters from a sign company."
