  body: This looks like a photoset face from the 1960s or 1970s. In any event, it's
    probably not Victorian, and it's definitely not Tuscan.

  body: "Agree with Nick.\r\nIt's too swooshy for Victorian. \r\nYou could make something
    similar by using a fat Caslon like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suomi/grumpy/\">Grumpy
    </a> [loosely based on based on <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-grouch/\">ITC
    Grouch</a>  by Tom Carnase] as a base, expanding the width and stretching the
    serifs to a point.\r\nDon"

  body: "This really does put me in mind of something that may have been originally
    done by a sign painter, all those sharp serifs look like they came from a chisel
    brush and that R really does seem to have a brushed quality about it. Although,
    the repeated letters appear just a little too identical, so it may well have been
    digitised later. \r\n\r\nMy feeling is that it's got to have some connection to
    a form of sign writer's Roman, not one that I can immediately find though! \r\n\r\nMmm...
    Delta Spur or Taroca - Nah, maybe not!\r\n\r\nIt may be worth a quick check with:

    of Frank H. Atkinson or Alf R. Becker.\r\n\r\nYou just have to look at the website,
    this \"Stream Rally\" is aimed at people who just love all that nostalgia, gold
    leaf and one shot enamel fairground artwork.\r\n\r\nJust a thought."

  body: Doghouse is right; it is hand-lettered. Careful examination of Don's enhancement
    shows small differences in the leg of the /R, the top serif of the /A and the
    top-left serif of the /N. I wish there was a digital version available; I really
    like it.

    may be right but I guess, even if it's pretty well done, Don's enhanced version
    comes from a cropped/expanded [[http://www.henhamsteamrally.com/userimages/2013_leaflet.png|LD
    (72dpi) 306x643px leaflet cover]] which could explain the small differences that
    actually I can't even see :D\r\nWhatever it is (scan, customization, hand-drawn...),
    I really like this lettering and would like to know more about it..."

    name: George Thomas
  body: The differences are not that small. For instance, the /R in the top line has
    a curve on the leg which stops at the baseline while the /R in the bottom line
    goes below the baseline. It also appears there may be a slight difference in the
    slope of the left side of the leg of the /R. The top serif in the /A in the second
    line has a different shape and slightly different length than the /A in the third
    line (same for the /M). In the word "RALLY" the bottom-right serif on the two
    /L's are different in length plus there is a slight different in the overall width
    of the two /L's.

    and frustrated not to find anything on this lettering that I can't even accept
    what should be definitely evident that I don't know it :D\r\nActually, I'm still
    convinced these (minor and blurry) differences are due to Don's sample reworking
    :D\r\nMay be asking directly via their website would be our last chance to solve
    this mystery..."

    an email and hopefully they will reply with some good information. I would like
    to know the origin of it. I checked my wood type catalogs and it isn't there either."

  body: "Yes the reworking is less than perfect.  There are always tradeoffs in enhancement,
    which in this case is an attempt to make a larger image that conforms to what
    the human eye sees in the small image, rather than the blurry result of a larger
    image produced by simple magnification. \r\nIf one attempts to make the tapered
    ends stand out the letters become too bold and outline detail is lost, such as
    the notch where the leg of R joins the bowl. I chose to try and preserve the outline
    as close as possible to what the human eye sees in the original small image. This
    means that bolding produced during the process must be reduced. This has the side
    effect of truncating the long tapered ends. I restored them by sketching them
    back in as lines by hand. I did not make other changes.\r\nAs for the variation
    among letters, I find it really difficult to decide whether it exists or is a
    result of this process. Anyway, I don't see anything to dispute in Ryuk's summary.\r\nEven
    if the originals are identical this does not mean it is a font.\r\nA hand lettered
    alphabet can be photographed and images collated and repeated as required to make
    words.\r\nNothing new about this.\r\nThe brushwork style on the leg of R and the
    serifs suggests the use of a showcard alphabet. In addition to the Atkinson and
    Becker books there were a lot of printed specimens by other lettering artists.
    Some research might find it.\r\nIt would be an interesting project to use this
    as a basis for a neo-nostalgia font. The missing letters are an exercise for the
    inquiring mind. For example a Q with a tail derived from R.\r\nIn sum, my vote
    based on the information we have so far, is for lettering rather than a font as
    the probable source.  Look forward George to whatever information the organizers
    might be able to give to you.\r\nDon"

    these signs dotted around near southwold and I was going to swipe one, strictly
    for evaluation purposes so to speak, ok to put on my office wall because the font/text
    is so great. Wish I had now, I could have got a better scan up.\r\n\r\nIf it isn't
    a font I'm gutted because I wont it, I've spent most of this week researching
    the sign and probibly know more about the event than the organisers plus I've
    probibly got their search rankings up too.\r\n\r\nI've contacted the organisers
    but no luck yet. If I find out more I'll share it out, if it is a sign-writer
    then I'll approach/commission a full font and digitise it."

    be to know which design studio did the last collaterals and leaflet, contact them
    and ask gently if they could provide the lettering as vector. Other option, would
    be to be commissioned by the rally organisation itself to develop a font.\r\nAdding
