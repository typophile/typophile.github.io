  body: "I just read a book set in MT Garamond (published in 1954).\r\nI love MT Garamond,
    especially the italic.\r\nSpecial for me about it is just that it\u2019s the <em>other</em>
    Garamond."

  body: 'Tiffany, it''s the lower case a. That seems to always be distinctive, and
    all the Garamonds are a little different. I''m not that fond of it, but someone
    who really knows the type told me that its swashes are some of the best. Just
    looking now, I can see what they meant. '

  body: "If you type \"Garamon\" into the search box at the bottom of the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Guide search page]] you get to see 27 Garamond/Garamont versions, more or less
    at once, and for many of them you can compare more complete samples. It shows
    how this 'a' really is not typical in the Monotype version.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
