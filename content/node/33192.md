  few problems which seems so easy in Indesign.\r\n\r\nSuch as:\r\n- How do you change
  the outline of text?\r\n- How can I turn Hyphenation on/off? Went into the H/J dialog
  box but can't seem to turn it off or on. ITS JUST A SIMPLE TICK IN INDESIGN!\r\n-
  And maybe I'm blind/dump but how do I get space between the top of the text-box
  and the text, in version 6.5?\r\n\r\nThese things are so straight forward (at least
  for me) in Indesign, I can't believe it's not so in Quark. Very frustrating.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help. "

    (or tick) auto-hyphenation\r\n3  Modify the text box (cmd+m on a mac) go to the
    text section and change the inset, you can do this for any side of the box\r\n\r\nTim"

    what you're used to.\r\nI've worked with Quark since 1988, and when InDesign came
    out in 2002, and did things differently of course, it took me a while to become
    familiar with it. So try to overcome the resentment and accept that it's just
    a different piece of software with a slightly different design logic."

  body: "Thanks for the replies guys. And Nick, you're right but it's busting my nuts.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the first questions was, as you add the type style \"outline\" (the '0' in the
    measurements box) to the text, how do you change its colour? And thanks for answering
    the other questions. \r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Avoid using those modification boxes for anything you don\u2019t get a true
    outline, italic or bold. If you want outlined text, create it in Illustrator and
    import it, if you must, select the text and apply colour either from the colour
    dialogue box or the style drop down menu.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Isn't the command "Text to Picture"? -- that turns live text into a picture
    box, so you can then apply a stroke value to the outline, and colour it, fill
    it with an image, whatever.

  body: "I haven\u2019t looked at that in recent versions of Quark, when it was introduced
    the quality of the outline was really unimpressive I compared the points in Quark
    to the points in Illustrator there were more in the Quark version and they seemed
    stiff, plus to outline text one needs the rule on the outside of the text and
    for most of my work it is preferable to have the rule on the inside of boxes etc
    and the preference can only be set one way or the other. Maybe I should have another
    look.\r\n\r\nTim"

    not to make judgements on the quality of software, just to reply to the question
    since that <em>is</em> the question. I imagine the frustration of posters asking
    questions about a specific piece of software only to be told that they should
    be using something else, rather like asking for directions and being told, \u2018Oh,
    I wouldn\u2019t start from here\u2019. FWIW I find the interface of Quark less
    cluttered than InDesign and that it is capable of producing fine work.\r\n\r\nTim"

    better off using InD\u2026.</cite>\r\n\r\nFine if you want to limit yourself to
    only one design software, but a lot of companies (at least here in NY) still use
    and require knowledge of Quark. I think it's well worth the effort to be fluent
    in both. Like Nick, I came from a Quark background, and I'm still more comfortable
    in Quark, got annoyed when I had to learn InD to keep up with the Joneses, and
    still get confused a bit when I jump from one to the other in the same day. But
    I'd limit my employement opportunities if I didn't have good working knowledge
    of both programs.\r\n\r\nOutlining type is definitely something InD does better/more
    easily than Quark."

    for years, but that doesn't mean I don't have it floating around on a back-up

    mean that one has to do the DTP equivalent of wearing a hair shirt just to prove
    that one can, either.  ;-)"
