body: "Hey guys, I was reading Gerrit Noordzij's translated \"The Stroke: Theory of
  Writing\" and am trying to get my head around applying the idea of white space to
  all forms of writing,\r\n<!--break-->\r\nas he says:\r\n\r\n\"Writing rests on the
  relative proportions of the white in the word. The various kinds of writing with
  their various constructions and their various strokes can be compared with each
  other only in terms of the white of the word \u2013 every comparison requires a
  vantage point that makes things comparable. The white of the word is the only thing
  all the various kinds of writing have in common. This universal vantage point holds
  for handwriting and typography alike, for ancient writing as well as modern writing,
  for western writing as well as the writing of other cultures, in short, it holds
  for writing.\"\r\n\r\nI'm doing research for my thesis on urban street typography
  in Metro Manila (Philippines). This is the link to the current research online:
  http://www.whoiscarlgraham.com/urbantype/jeepneytypography.htm \r\n\r\nI am fascinated
  how Noordzij says this but am wondering if there's some structured way I can speak
  about the type using the concept of white space. I loved \"The stroke of the pen,\"
  but I'm still trying to fully grasp the concepts covered as I feel they can really
  help me with my thesis."

  body: ">  the relative proportions of the white in the word\r\n\r\nWhat he's talking
    about is \"negative space\", which is the space around an object. It's an important
    concept in graphic design. Sounds like he's focused on the space immediately around
    the characters themselves, rather than the entire page or sign.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    call it \"the white\" because that's only accurate when writing on a white surface.
    If a sign has white type on a red background, for instance, the negative space
    is red.\r\n\r\n> The white of the word is the only thing all the \r\n> various
    kinds of writing have in common.\r\n\r\nI haven't read his writing, but my offhand
    impression is that his comment doesn't seem very useful. The negative space is
    dictated by the shapes of the letters. If the negative spaces have common traits,
    it's because the writing itself has common traits."

    what <strong>you</strong> mean when you use a word in your paper. Not a formal
    declaration of the word\u2019s meaning in every context in every dictionary in
    the world. Just for the purpose of your paper. This prevents potential misinterpretation
    and is standard practice in virtually all writing at a graduate level and beyond.\r\n\r\n7.
    The structure of your current writing is remarkably close to the APA structure
    of a manuscript. I encourage you to move forward in that direction to formalize
    your work. See:\r\n\r\nAmerican Psychological Association, (2009). <em>Publication

    your literature review and remember to stay focused. It feels very daunting at

    were talking about the <em>shape</em> of the white, I'd agree that there are specific
    situations in which the marking of the black determines the shape of the white
    such that the latter must be considered secondary. By the same token, though,
    if one were to manipulate the pen to shape the white in some particular way, that
    would subjugate the black to the white, and I'm not sure the situation is much
    changed if one creates the black/white edges in some independent way: decisions
    about shapes affect adjacent shapes.\r\n\r\nBut Noordzij is <em>not</em> talking
    about the shape of the white, he is talking about 'the relative proportions of
    the white in the word', in the context of comparing different examples of writing.
    His point, and I think it is a sound one, is that if one seeks a single common
    measure by which one can compare <em>any</em> two or more examples -- regardless
    of script, age, style -- then the only measure available is relative proportion
    of the white, because all other aspects of the examples introduce too many variables.
    In particular, note that the stroke itself does not provide such a measure."

  body: Hrant, we're talking about measures of comparison, a basic principle of which
    is that you need to isolate the factors that are unique to the things being compared,
    and identify a common factor or factors. In the case of text, given the particularities
    of writing systems and of individual styles within those writing systems, proportion
    of white isn't the easiest measure available, it is the only common measure. This
    is not to say that there are not other common measures that would apply to some
    particular set of compared examples -- slant is a common measure by which italics
    can be compared, for example, but not romans --, only that when you take all text,
    in toto, the only common basis on which they can <em>all</em> be compared is relative
    proportion of white. And I don't think Noordzij is making this point in order
    to suggest that comparing different examples of writing in this way is a useful
    exercise, but to stress the universality of the proportional role of the white
    in all the world's writing systems.

    type using the concept of white space.\r\n\r\nI see chapter 1 of <em>The Stroke</em>
    as a manifesto about something that eludes \u2018structural\u2019 description,
    and less about the \u2018synergy\u2019 between the \u2018white\u2019 and the \u2018black,\u2019
    than about the centrality of the white.\r\n\r\nIn writing, that is, when it comes
    to readability, it's all about the white. The black of the letter must be close
    enough to conventional forms to be identifiable \u2014 and these vary from type
    to type and script to script \u2014 but when it comes to words and texts (which
    are what writing puts in place) the white is primary. If there is no equi-valence
    between the whites inside the letters  and the whites between the letters, and
    if there is no disruption between the white of the word and the white space between
    words, the word disappears because the word-image as a bounded visual gestalt
    or unitary object-like entity falls apart.\r\n\r\nHowever, while you can get a
    precise or \u2018structural\u2019 description of the black, even when the shapes
    deviate from the strokes of writing in systematic (and unsystematic!) ways, you
    can only gauge the whites of the word according to their comparative \u2018weights\u2019
    or valence.\r\n\r\nI said the white eludes structural description, but it is possible
    to talk about the hierarchy of the whites in typography.\r\n\r\nPeter Enneson"

    and around the black. That is the white, and it has to work with the black in
    a way that is consistent, ordered and rational. It literally controls how the
    black should appear.\r\n\r\nThis too defines spacing/kerning."

    not without the kind of nuance in the interpretation of the words that requires
    quite a lot of explication. I think it is possible to approach type design in
    relationship to written forms in a variety of ways without evoking 'norms' or
    suggesting that some of these ways represent violations. My own approach is to
    recognise that -- presuming one is designing for a cultural script, i.e. one that
    has evolved over time in the literary life of communities with particular histories
    -- almost all scripts have originated in and/or passed through writing, and this
    process has established the shapes of the signs as expressed by particular tools
    and movements. Hence, reference to those tools and movements is a legitimate and
    sensible aspect of typeface design, and what is important here is not that this
    anchors types to 'norms' of letter shape or stroke modulation but that it anchors
    them within the script culture.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that is interesting to
    me about Legato is just how comfortably it sits within the Latin script culture,
    despite doing things that would be considered norm-violations in your analysis.
    I think this comes from the strength of structure -- the sense of a skeleton even
    though the edge relationships plainly demonstrate that none can exist -- and also
    the quality and measure of tension in the \"strokes\", which although being differently
    arrived at is of a similar tenor to that found elsewhere in the line of 'humanist
    sans' derived from more traditional constructions."

    about is the strong sense of structure, and the fact that even though the edges
    do not follow a traditional or tool derived relationship there is no sense of
    structural wobble in Legato. Contrast this with types that attempt a traditional
    edge relationship but fail because of lack of experience or skill of the designer
    (the Typophile critique forums have plenty of examples): they're less a 'norm-violation'
    than Legato, but also less structurally sound because what happens in their edge
    relationships introduces wobble in the perception of the shapes. This is important,
    and I think it is key to the success of Legato's systematic approach to edge relationships:
    even though no writing tool or manipulation can create quite those 'strokes',
    one can impose a hairline skeleton on the Legato letters and see that a) it is
    a strong structural form and b) the relationships of the edges to that skeleton
    are systematic and consistent. <em>They're just not tool based.</em>\r\n\r\nNow
    here is an interesting idea: since the relationship of edges to a structural skeleton
    in Legato do seem to follow a consistent, systematic approach, would it be possible
    to algorithmically expand that skeleton to produce these kinds of relationships?
    That seems to me a practical question that could be practically explored. Why
    would one bother? Well, it would settle the question of how illusory or not the
    perception of a skeletal structure in Legato is. What it wouldn't do it settle
    how important that perception -- illusory or not -- is to the readability of the
    type. I theorise that it is important because what we recognise in reading --
    at text sizes in any case -- is <em>shapes</em> not edge relationships, and hence
    edge relationships need to support the perception of shape not undermine it (which
    is why wobble is a problem)."
