  font used in the title, mainly the roman A, modern, withou the bar... does anyone
  know similar fonts? not so modern, sofisticated and at the same time with roman
  traces...\r\n\r\nThank you very much"

  body: "There are similar fonts, commonly labeled as demi or semi serif.\r\nTo make
    them the designer snips off various serifs, and voila! a new font.\r\nThis one
    may be a custom snip job. The crossbar on A has joined various serifs in the trashcan.
    \r\nCompare the snipped version on the lhs with the one on the rhs, which is probably
    the source font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snip_5615.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "Works for me as a match.\r\nBTW the contours of Gara looked very familiar.\r\nI
    checked and confirmed an exact match with Adobe Garamond LT, regular, except for
    the snipped parts.\r\nTo confirm, check an unmodified letter such as g, or 5,
    in Fontshop.\r\nI suspect that Adobe would see Gara as an infringement. The embedding
    permissions for Adobe Garamond are \"Only printing and previewing of the document

    by Greek *Lambda*.
