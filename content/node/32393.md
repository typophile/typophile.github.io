  together to pool resources and talent. The goals are to create a strong, unifying
  branding element that can be used for communicating with government, private, educational,
  and charitable organizations in health care.\r\n\r\nThe hand is certainly clich\xE9,
  but they really like the idea it conveys. It's automatically humanistic. To the
  client, it represents caring. In this logo, it's also catching those who are falling
  through the cracks.\r\n\r\nThe name is very long and it really can't be abbreviated.
  I am trying to give the type enough visual interest that it could stand on its own
  without the logo.\r\n\r\nI respect all your opinions, so I'd love to hear feedback.
  What do you think of the type choice (Chianti)? The logo? Does the positive shape
  register more strongly than the negative shape? (I don't want the negative shape
  to pop at all... it doesn't represent anything.)\r\n\r\nThanks for your critiques!\r\n\r\n

  body: "I think the hand can work in that level of abstraction. The problem I have
    is with the negative shape creating a fish or a biting shark. Safetynet and trapped
    fish or shark seem to go against ehat you are trying to say. You may want to try
    taking away most of the top black line which completes the circle and letting
    it be open.\r\nThe star sizes and shapes are less successful. Try some other ways
    of drawing them.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    said, I agree with dezcom...it works as an abstract shape just fine. Maybe some

    thing when you pitch it to the client \"wave of the future in helping hand services...\"
    or something like that. ;0)\r\n\r\nIf you do want it to literally be a hand, then
    be a bit more literal. I agree with Quincunx...try removing the top portion of
    the circle and refine the hand shape. \r\n\r\nI don't know if you HAVE to do that,
    though...I like what I see right now."

  body: "I didn't see the \"hand\" until I read your introduction. I saw a silly muppet
    face in the positive, where the stars were eyes and the thumb was a mouth agape.
    \r\n\r\nI'd recommend maybe adding more detail to the hand, maybe indicate more
    of a thumb by adding an upward bend towards the tip (this'll help create a look
    as if the hand was cradling a ball.) Also you might want to add another curve
    to indicate the first fingertip, nothing  elaborate, but enough to break up the
    immediate transition into the circle. \r\n\r\nAnother suggestion would be to flip
    the stars to break up the pattern, thus reducing the appears of \"eyes\". I think
    I see it because the largest star is closest to me, giving perspective to the
    \"face\". \r\n\r\nI do like your type choice, though it does feel a bit tight.
    It's approachable. "

  body: "I saw the hand immediately, but it could be clearer, possibly by defining
    the fingertips better. I'd have to see both options to see what works better.
    The logo also reminds me of a marble.\r\n\r\nAs for the type, try setting the
    bolder type in the darker colour to mirror the dark area of the logo. This may
    unify them better.\r\n\r\nAlso, try aligning the stars along an arc from the wrist
    to the palm, to convey a bigger sense of motion. Pick either a point or the space
    between two points to be the leading edge of the stars. I hope this makes sense.\r\n\r\n

  body: "One more dip into the font of wisdom.... After some more feedback, I tweaked
    the design to arrive at this logo:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WCSNC(3)_4402.jpg]\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The
    kerning has been stabilized. Several of you mentioned the type was fairly tight,
    so I opened it up just a bit (especially the heavy text.) <em>If you see any glaring
    imbalances, let me know!</em></li>\r\n<li>Nodes have been checked and made orthogonal
    as much as possible.</li>\r\n<li>The golden ratio was used to help refine the
    objects' positions in the lockup.</li>\r\n<li>I made a horizontal lockup too,
    but it's not shown here.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nFeedback I got today from the client
    (a very small subset of the decision-making committee) suggested adding more detail
    to the hand, but I disagree with that. The design is intended to be fairly abstract.
    With more detail, it would look too much like the United Way logo. For me, the
    abstraction permits at least a bit of uniqueness to an otherwise very clich\xE9
    concept.\r\n\r\nI also don't want to disrupt the smooth flow out of and back into
    the circle. I really like the pleasing and simple geometry. I might have to work
    to sell them on that concept, but I feel pretty strongly that the hand has just
    enough detail... especially after incorporating suggestions mentioned here which
    helped me clarify the finger and thumb shapes. (I really wanted to keep the finger
    transition I had originally, but I agree that it may have been too subtle and
    abstract to be seen as an open hand.)\r\n\r\nOthers have asked whether stars are
    the right choice. In my first draft sketches, the \"hand\" concept was just one
    of four. It had a star hovering above it for purely arbitrary reasons. It was
    just a sketch. I sent them a list of questions (inspired by the writings of <a
    href=\"http://www.identityworks.com/\">Tony Spaeth</a>) and asked them to \"justify\"
    the star and hand. I wanted them to explain to me why they liked those icons and
    what they meant within the context of their organization and mission so I could
    refine them. I didn't get much input!\r\n\r\nThis is MY interpretation of what
    it could mean for them. These stars are experiencing difficulty. They are patients
    being caught by the safety net. It hints obliquely at the Kansas motto, \"Ad astera
    per aspera.\" After reading Gardner's <a href=\"http://www.logolounge.com/articles/default.asp?Archive=True&ArticleID=414\">\"2005
    Trends\"</a> article, I felt less guilty about relying on such simple iconography.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    pink hearts, yellow moons, green clovers, blue diamonds and purple horseshoes
    didn't work as well. :-)"
