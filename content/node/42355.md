  how time flies, if you are having fun. ;) So this is my tribute to Typophile after
  some 6 years on here. (More ore less frequently.) I still love this place and the
  kindness of a lot of people on here is breathtaking. So with respect and thankfulness
  I celebrate my 6th anniversary. ;)\r\n\r\nDav(id)"

  body: 9 more weeks and it'll be 3 for me! Typophile is definitely a diamond in the
    rough when it comes to web hospitality and overall accepting attitudes. Open arms
    to anyone that loves the letter.
