To be honest, that's one of the things I like about the caps that this fonts was based upon; it has that old woodtype naïveté, well before the idea of light trapping became popular. As such, a lot of old wood types have an uneven color that is part of their charm. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Still, I agree with you that more balanced characters should at least be offered with the font, so I'll likely include those with either the main font or with an alternate set. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the lc &quot;g&quot;, I've been resisting the idea of doing a monocle form, but perhaps that would solve the problem? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On another subject, now that the font has been posted, I've noticed that the daggers are much too heavy&hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(And no comments from Hrant about my ascending lc &quot;2&quot;? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> ) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree that traps aren't really a new design element. My wording was careless in my previous post. The point I intended to make is that some faces are charming without them, and with the resulting uneven color. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New York Times Magazine has used a woodtype-style (more or less) untrapped gothic (the name of which I do not know) with a very uneven color which is extremely inviting to read. Does anyone know the name of the font to which I'm referring? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as numerals go, I'm still not entirely sure about the ascending &quot;2&quot;, although it makes a great alternative to a &quot;2&quot; that would otherwise look unnaturally squished if constrained to the x-height. I'm also finding that the &quot;4&quot; can work equally well ascending or descending, depending on the design, although in most (if not all) of my faces, I have designed it descending. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wonder if a good rule of thumb might be to have the even numerals &quot;2&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;6&quot; and &quot;8&quot; ascend, and have the odd numerals &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;7&quot; and &quot;9&quot; descend, while keeping &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; constrained to the x-height?

		<div class="commentbody">This is tricky stuff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I started writing a mini treatise, but the time and place are both wrong, so let me ask some questions instead: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What are the numerals suppose to do in a text face? I mean beyond the obvious &quot;convey numeric information&quot;. *How* does a numeral string do its job during immersive reading? Why are oldstyle numerals more readable?

Or is also (perhaps more so) that they form better word shapes (just like lc versus UC), in particular in common numerals strings (eg &quot;1968&quot;)? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The answers to these questions will greatly help determine things. Tradition does have a role to play, but especially in the case of numerals a lot less than some old[er] folks would have us believe. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Readers don't consciously care if a &quot;2&quot; is ascending or not. The question is, what does the subconscious -which is largely responsible for immersive reading anyway- really cherish? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, concerning the even distribution of extenderness, note that: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. In running text (even more so than in the Latin alphabet itself), ascenders are much common than descenders. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Numeral frequency is not &quot;flat&quot;: some numerals are much more common than others. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. And another question: should numeral strings perhaps *diverge* to some extent from running text in vertical span/location?&hellip; This is similar to the question: does some degree of -probably- controlled irregularity help readability? I for one think that there is such a thing as too much even color. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chew on that, dudes&hellip;  :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed, it is tricky stuff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of the reasons I have always designed the &quot;4&quot; as descending is that early on in my own experience, I registered that the bars of &quot;2&quot;, &quot;1&quot; (when it has the base serif) and a descending &quot;4&quot; line up attractively and guide my eye as I read. At least to my own perception, this helps form a &quot;better&quot; word shape, although I'm not sure I could put my finger on what makes one word shape &quot;better&quot; (or more readable) than another. Certainly variety of ascenders/descenders plays a part, but the case-by-case design of the letter must be taken into account as well, I think. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You also make some interesting and valid points on &quot;extenderness distribution&quot; ( <!-- raw HTML omitted --> ). However, specifically regarding your third point about vertical span divergence of numerals, two fonts which tried this with the numerals spring to mind: Richard Austin's &quot;Bell,&quot; which gave the numerals three-quarters the height of an otherwise lining-numeral design; and Jan van Krimpen's &quot;Spectrum,&quot; which keeps to the x-height but has very short (about one-third proportion, to my eye) ascenders and descenders. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not sure that either design is really successful as regards the design numerals. Spectrum's ascenders and descenders are too close to the x-height to offer any assistance to the word-shape, while Bell's numerals miss the argument entirely by employing dwarfed lining figures rather than text figures. They don't stand out from the text like full lining figures do, but they create bland, rectangular word shapes that also offer no additional assistance to gestalt comprehension. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In short (no pun necessarily intended), I'm not sure if varying the vertical span for numerals offers any practical net assistance to legibility/readability. Still, I will grant you, it's an idea that is far from having been fully tested. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Chewing away&hellip; and intrigued by the idea nonetheless&hellip;.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's probably a big part of it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And, of course, we can't forget the divergent histories of the alphabet itself, which is the reason we have upper and lower case characters at all; the upper case characters being descendants of the Cretan pictographs via Phoenecian characters via Roman inscriptions, and the lower case diverging at this point and developing through the uncial hand forms via half-uncials into the familiar ascender/descender forms we know today. It was the notion of enhanced legibility of word shapes (and ease of writing), in part, that contributed to the decision to merge the two systems into our current bicameral alphabet. (Tricameral, if one counts the small caps; insert prefix of your choice if one counts the italics as well.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Apologies for restating the condensed history of the alphabet, but it's integral to the discussion, and besides, at least I crammed it all into one paragraph. ;) ) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems that the same considerations of legibility led to the lining and text figure dichotomy of the Arabic script numerals: lining figures seem best suited for titles, tabular settings and other display applications, while text figures seem to be more legible and aesthetically pleasing in text settings. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which came first, the lining figures or the text figures? To be honest, I don't know for sure &ndash; most of the books I have either ignore completely or gloss over the history of the figures. I suspect the original forms were closer to lining figures, and the text figures developed from them (much like the lower case figures derived from the capitals). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->While text figures didn't derive (directly, at least) from the uncial hand, they seem to have been intended to emulate it. This, I think, helps to alleviate the problem that Joe pointed out: a script-based figure set becomes more harmonized with a geometric-based alphabet when it carries visual elements in common, i.e., ascenders and descenders, and the rhythm and gestalt that they create. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Different type designers have achieved this harmony in different ways, designing some figures to ascend and others to descend, or altering the length of the extenders relative to the alphabetic characters, or even doing away with the extenders completely. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Bell's time (mid-eighteenth century), the fashionable solution was the three-quarter-height lining figure, rather than text figures. Many nineteenth and twentieth century type designers attempted to do away with the text figures altogether (as well as the lower case set, in many cases), which helps to explain why there is such a dearth of typefaces with complete lining AND text figure sets today (to say nothing of superiors, inferiors and titling sets). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is only relatively recently that the value of the text figures (and the larger value of word shapes and legibility) has enjoyed a sort of renaissance, which is why we're all here discussing the subject today. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Credit must be given to Robert Bringhurst for most of the above history, and his book, &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; &ndash; it holds a solid place among my favorite typographic references. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Thometz</div>

And back to your original question, I suppose we can't completely rule out the effects of the Bauhaus movement and its call for a unicase alphabet in our discussion as well. The Bauhaus did, in fact, &quot;question the descender on the lower case p,&quot; as well as the entirety of the bicameral alphabet system. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Many of the Bauhaus fonts questioned the lining-/text-figure dichotomy as well, although ironically, many designers still fashioned lining as well as text figures for their fonts from this period. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd be very interested if anyone can offer more history on the Arabic script numerals that we use today. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Anders: Thanks for the interesting references! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It all seems plausible to me except for the bit about the supposed geometric origins of the Arabic numerals proposed by M. Erhayiem. (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.arabicnumerals.cwc.net/">http://www.arabicnumerals.cwc.net/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->)  I must admit that I am skeptical about this &quot;number of angles&quot; theory. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two elements of the theory specifically raise red flags in my mind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, many of the forms that Erhayiem proposes (especially the &quot;7&quot; and the &quot;9&quot;) seem contrived to fit the theory rather than being derived from it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second, these forms don't seem to match what we know about the early development of many of the figures, notably &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;7&quot; and &quot;8&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Review J J O'Connor's and E F Robertson's article at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html">http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rest of it, however, pretty much sustains what I remember from history classes and my own research. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also seem to remember reading somewhere that the Indo-Arabic figures had their basis in cuneiform impressions, and it was curiously similar in many respects to systems used by pre-Columbian civilizations in South and Central America. &quot;1&quot; was represented by a single horizontal line segment, &quot;2&quot; was represented by two stacking horizontal line segments, and &quot;3&quot; was represented by three stacking horizontal line segments. (The system altered from this pattern for numbers above &quot;3&quot;.) A theory suggests that when drawn quickly (at least in left-to-right writing), connecting lines formed between the stacking lines forming characters resembling our current figures &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll see if I can track down some references to this theory. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, where were we&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The true nature of the functionality of the numerals is still beyond my grasp, so I'll have to think about that off-line (even though talking out loud -not to mention listening to others- helps me think better). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there are some things I can bite into: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Why has this come to even be an issue? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; It's not like we ever question the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; descender on the lower case p. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, I try to question everything all of the time, or at least as time and circumstance permit. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->During my Alphabet Reform work one of the things I realized early was that -ideally- some letters should have their very extenderness changed. For example, perhaps the best candidate for this is the lc &quot;e&quot;: making its jaw descend (maybe not all the way down) would really help form more distinctive word shapes, and would provide better vertical balance to text. Part of the reason is that its structure can easily accomodate such a modification, and part of it is that it's the most common letter (maximum impact with minimum application/learning) and another part of it is that the &quot;e&quot; is too similar to the &quot;c&quot; and &quot;o&quot;. However, anticipating stiff resistance (even the best idea is useless if not enough people go for it), I decided to limit it to tweaking the extenders of letter which already had extenders. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Does it all really stem from the fundamentally distinct origins of the Roman alphabet and Arabic numerals? (A more or less geometric alphabet clashing with more or less scripty figures). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as I know, yes. But it's not just a matter of degree of calligraphy. The stress of Arabic is horizontal (as opposed to Latin's vertical), and that's what bugs me the most. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Is there something more to it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Probably. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the upper case characters being descendants of the Cretan pictographs via Phoenecian characters via Roman inscriptions <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just to nitpick: Anything going &quot;back&quot; from the Phoenecians is highly disputed among scholars. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; It was the notion of enhanced legibility of word shapes (and ease of writing), in part, that contributed to the decision to merge the two systems into our current bicameral alphabet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That would have been inspiring, but the earliest known indication of us realizing the importance of word shapes is towards the end of the 19th century (Javal). Not only that, but even today many (perhaps most) designers are in denial about it, or simply don't care. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anders: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Great numeral history! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And killer links too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So, to get back to David's alphabet, I would like to point out that I would like to see another version of the &quot;ß&quot;, which seems to me too marshmallow-y. I know that this a condensed typeface, but it could stand to be a little sprucer, you know, have a bit more juice in its pectorals. Also, I love the detail on the &quot;1&quot;, very distinctive. I would love to see it somewhere else, but I can't think of where as it is obviously the &quot;distinctor&quot; (can you say that?) between the &quot;1&quot; and the lc &quot;l&quot;. Also, I noticed that it is very strong in smaller size, would you consider making an attempt to design it as a screen font? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also: the }{ guys seem wrong to my eye&hellip;too round, too much like a bird's beak. And the $ has a weird optical thing happening, where the stroke seems to tweak the inside arcs in a bad way. I don't know if the solution is to try a broken stroke or to tweak the counter space to make it breath a little bit more. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*L*</div>
