  finally here! The OpenType Basic version, full commercial licence, of Adelle Bold
  and Bold Italic can be downloaded free of charge at TypeTogether's website. \r\n\r\nThe
  award winning Adelle is a dynamic slab serif designed by Veronika Burian and Jos\xE9
  Scaglione. While it is conceived specifically for intensive editorial use, its personality
  and flexibility make it a real multiple-purpose typeface. The intermediate weights
  deliver a very legible and neutral look when used in text sizes, providing the usual
  robustness expected in a newspaper font. The unobstrusive appearance, excellent
  texture and slightly dark color allow it to behave flawlesly in continuous text
  setting, even in the most demanding editorial applications.\r\n\r\nAs it becomes
  larger in print, Adelle shows its personality through a series of meassured particularities
  that make it easy to remember and identify. Its energetic character, so inherent
  to slab serif fonts, becomes evident as the typeface is used for subheadings and
  headlines.\r\n\r\nThe full OpenType Pro version of this font family has 12 styles,
  ranging from light to heavy, with more than 900 characters per font. It provides
  support for many OpenType features such as small caps, stylistic alternates, fractions,
  five sets of figures and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo download the fonts go to the address
