body: Hello all I am currently a high school student, graduating this year, and I
  am trying to make up my mind what I am going to do new year. <BR> <BR>My first choice
  was the Ontario College of Art and Design - Bachelor of Design program. I didnt
  get accepted there because my fine art work was not strong enough because I know
  their program enforces a very strong background in Fine Art, especially after they
  ditched their foundation art year. My high school art programs didnt teach me to
  paint or draw so I had to teach myself. <BR> <BR>So what I planned to do was go
  to George Brown in Toronto for art fundamentals and improve my work and re apply
  to OCAD the next year. <BR> <BR>However today I found out I was accepted into the
  York University and Sheridan College joint program for their Bachelor of Design
  program. I don&#39;t know as much about York/Sheridan as I do about OCAD, and I
  know they have had some pretty good press about their program but I am concerned
  about their academic vs practical teaching in that school. <BR> <BR>Can anyone offer
  me any advice on my decision or know about the two programs? They both offer the
  same degree so I am guessing there may be an oportunity to transfer from York if
  I didnt like it.

  body: York/Sheridan is good - least its a degree rather then a diploma at George
    Brown. But you get the best of both worlds be being linked with the college for
    technical skills.  <BR> <BR>OCAD I find is going downhill for design programs
    - of all the people I know who&#39;ve gone or are familiar with the program they
    say it&#39;s based far too much on theory/thesis and not enough practice. I know
    Industrial Designer&#39;s from there who never even heard of autoCAD - that&#39;s
    a bit scary. Not that I want to push the computer aspect but to be employable
    they are skills that you&#39;re going to have to learn on the side if you were
    at OCAD. And if you were at George Brown you might have too much practice and
    not enough thinking to do.   <BR> <BR>york/sheridan is a good choice - it&#39;s
    a new program &#40;well only a few years old I think&#41; but they have some pretty
    spiffy looking courses. go go go.

  body: Thanks for the info Tanya! <BR> <BR>I wasnt looking to finish ym education
    with George Brown, only to build my fine art portfolio to help me get into OCAD.
    It is a shame to hear that they are lacking in the design program, because of
    my friends who is a graduate from the school said when he went it was mostly practical
    and was concerned that there would not be enough practical experience at York.
    <BR> <BR>I have been thinking about all the options and I think I am going to
    stick with York U/Sheridan for now, and if I really didnt like it then I would
    reapply to OCAD or try to transfer.  <BR> <BR>Nick Shinn was able to give me some
    helpfull information and the typeface design class sounds really interesting.
    <BR> <BR>Anyways I got the official letter from York and a scholarship so I am
    pretty happy today!

  body: 'A few weeks late, but hopefully I can help. <BR> <BR>I attend ocad and I
    find it&#39;s design program excellent. I think there is a good blend of practical
    and theoretical experience. One good thing about ocad is that the assignments
    are quite open, they really become what you make them. ie: It may seem like an
    ordinary assignment, but can turn into a great piece of design if you put a lot
    into it. However If you&#39;re mainly interested in type design I agree with nick,
    york/sheridan is the way to go. <BR> <BR>check out the forums on <a href="http://www.myocad.com"
    target="_blank">www.myocad.com</a> for some good threads in the archive about  OCAD
    vs York &#40;from both ocad and york students&#41; <BR> <BR>oh, and take comments
    from ocad students with a grain of salt; they are a great bunch of people but
    they complain non-stop...'
