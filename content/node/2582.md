body: 'After visiting family on the west coast over the holidays, I returned home
  the long route due to snow in Chicago, &#40;over 24 hrs city hopping on standby&#41;.
  The upside was that I got to gander at several newspapers along the way &#40;New
  York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today, San Jose Mercury News and San Francisco
  Chronicle&#41;. I was too shot to compare from a content standpoint, but it was
  interesting from a design perspective. The SF Chronicle is a lovely looking paper,
  tops of the group in my opinion. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve spent a bit of time researching
  the Chronicle redesign and didn&#39;t find too much &#40;it was Danilo/Black job
  I think, but their site lays claim only to the sunday edition&#41;. Anyone know
  what the type is and who did it &#40;not the condensed sans, the serif headline
  and body&#41;? It is a beautiful combination of fresh character and legibility.
  By contrast, the others looked stale &#40;suprising to me, even Gulliver in USA
  Today seemed blah&#41;. <BR> <BR>The San Jose Merc type is ugliness personified
  &#40;IMHO&#41; despite it&#39;s redesign. <BR> <BR>In the end content is king, but
  a casual design survey was fun. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy '

    &#34;cute&#34; for news headings. Then again, it <i>is</i> USA Today... <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: WRT Gulliver I&#39;ve heard conflicting reports regarding Prof. Unger&#39;s
    opinion of USA Today&#39;s use of the typeface - does anyone have any quotes,
    from the horse&#39;s mouth, so to speak? <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: Funny, Simon, I was wondering the same thing the other day. Unger seems to
    take a pragmatic stance about those things, in that you can&#39;t control what
    the user does with your work &#40;and you should just be happy they bought the
    stuff&#41;. Of course a very good reason not to get nasty is that a past customer
    could be a future customer. <BR> <BR>The type of stuff he says about it is &#34;you
    wouldn&#39;t think it would work but that&#39;s the way their readers seem to
    like it&#34;, etc... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hrant, you&#39;re right I wouldn&#39;t expect him to go on the record with
    his opinion, but he does reference the paper&#39;s use of the font on his site...
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-gulliver.html" target="_blank">http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-gulliver.html</a>  <BR>
    <BR>...which I doubt he would do if he felt the distortions you&#39;re seeing
    had totally ruined the appearance of the type.   <BR> <BR>Si

  body: Thanks for the link. Of interest to me were the comments about using Gulliver
    for text and display. The SF Chronicle also uses the same font for text and headlines
    &#40;alternated with a sans&#41;, though it looks like a special display version.
    At any rate, it looks sharp and unified. Again, anybody know who did the type?
    I&#39;ll post in the ID section too. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: One thing you can do is visit the indispensable newseum.org , go to the &#34;Today&#39;s
    Front Pages&#34; section, see if the paper you want entered that day &#40;it&#39;s
    highly variable&#41;, download the PDF &#40;sometimes a bitmap PDF though&#41;
    and check in the doc info for the font names. Custom faces often have unpublished
    names however, but you can always sic Google on it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    has been really kind to Typographica lately. <BR> <BR>Randy - I answered your

    SF Chron post in the Font ID forum</a>,  <BR>but I am going by memory of a long-standing
    design. Was it <BR>recently redesigned? I haven&#39;t seen it since my last Macworld
    <BR>excursion in January 2002.'
