body: "This is a somewhat absurdly OCD question, but I figure I've come to the right
  place to ask about fonts; I initially posed this question in a guitar forum & got
  nowhere:\r\nBeginning in '74, Pete Townsend of The Who numbered his Les Pauls (guitars)
  1-9 for different tunings etc. Between songs he would take them off & literally
  throw the guitar to a roadie- I remember being very impressed by all this business
  with the numbered guitars when I saw them in the mid-'70s. What font was he (or
  his guitar tech) using?\r\nSee here as I can't seem to get the img tag to work:\r\n[[http://www.feelnumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/76_ptbackstage-tuning1.jpg]]\r\nI
  was thinking about putting a number on a Les Paul I just got, but can't find the
  right font among the bazillions on my Mac or with an online search. \r\nIt's very
  close to the London Underground font aka P22 Johnston in bold variants, but the
  \"8\" among others is off.\r\nCan anyone tell me the right font?\r\nOne clue would
  be whatever fonts were available in Presstype rub-on lettering in 1974 (or, more
  likely, some UK equivalent I've never heard of), as I'd bet that was what was used
  to number the guitars.\r\nMany thanx for any help.\r\n"

    is your mystery font.'

  body: "Thanks for the replies; the guitar guys came through with the fact (from
    a/the Who site) that they are Letraset numbers (so I was right about a UK equivalent
    of Presstype, although one I used a lot in the '70s, but had forgotten- this probably
    explains the maddening familiarity of the font).\r\nLetraset's closest current
    font is Charlotte Book Sans, which is close but no cigar, perhaps because the
    site says it was done in 1992 & thus unlikely to have been very available in 1974.\r\neliason:
    yes, very close & likely you are correct that the designer is \"biting\" (as we
    used to say when we did calligraphy on the MTA) what I'm looking for (as is the
    current Letraset font, which in any case doesn't come in the white 5\" high numerals
    needed).\r\nOne of the guitar guys blew up a pic of one of Townsend's guitars
    to lifesize & traced the number to make one for his guitar, so you can see I'm
    not [entirely] alone in my OCD-ness., "
