  a micro press for publishing small\r\nruns of specialty volumes. The progression
  of ideas was\r\nfrom the top left (gold), top right (silver) and bottom (green).\r\nThe
  name 'newrome' refers to New Rome (Constantinople).\r\nThis micro press' main purpose
  is to publish volumes\r\nin the field of Byzantine Studies / Eastern Orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any feedback.\r\n\r\n(I managed to accidentally delete the original topic while

  body: An initial thought is that the heavy bar underneath seems to oppose the sinuous
    lines of the tree. Another is the typefaces seem earthy while the tree is almost
    ethereal.

  body: "I think the tree-drawing is very sweet. But I wonder how usable it is (how
    will it look when reduced in size?). Could it perhaps be made more stylized or
    'compact' somehow. I also think the version to the right is the one that manages
    to let the tree 'grow' so to speak. The large type on the others seem to diminish
    the illustration. I'd agree that the type + bar are too heavy. What about trying
    with a lighter weight?\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the comments thus far. I am in the process of digesting them!\r\n\r\nMy
    original thought was, re. the heaviness of the bar / the lightness of the\r\ntree,
    the tree / the flower, was the tension between the new and the old, tradition
    vs. innovation, \r\nbut maybe that is lost on the whole thing.\r\n\r\nAs for small
    size reproduction, I had thought of that and have reproduced it in many\r\nsizes.
    It is definitely a issue to consider further.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    flower. Is cool. If you are not satisfied, try other variations of this style.
    I like it.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\"Temet

  body: "Andr\xE9, thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nI did use some clipart for the
    tree (though it has been modified in all versions to a greater or lesser degree)
    -- have I committed some cardinal sin? It seems as though Ratbaggy wants to out
    me! Ha ha. With that in mind, let me also confess that I did not handcut and digitize
    the typefaces either. :)\r\n\r\nMaybe I better go draw my own tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like the silver-and-blue version best. I like the tree graphic very much.
    But I'm having a hard time relating the graphic to: publishing, books, Constantine
    I, Eastern Orthodoxy, the Byzantine Empire, or anything to do with your micro-press.
    \r\n\r\nIf I try to imagine your logo and a undescriptive headline on a book cover
    (something like \"Studies of Historic Turkey\"), my first thought would be of
    the islamic Ottoman Empire and not the Eastern Orthodox Byzantine Empire. "

  body: "It appears to me that the point is having a tree there. Oak Tree? (from the
    wood furniture), or is it a sort of arabesque just so it's mass has whites around
    and is not a massive square or circle.\r\n\r\nIf you insist in this tree, you
    will get it - just need some hours on it. Make variations of color with a result
    you will get, by modifying what you already have. The clipart feel then will then
    puff away. The curve is to be not precise or symmetric, like hand drawn. Well,
    just work on it. The result can be seem at the end, many hours later. :-)"

  body: "KenBessie,\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments. As I had mentioned above, the
    idea is the tension between new / old, tradition / innovation, old growth / new
    growth. The point of the tree is old growth / the flower new (unexpected) growth.
    The use of the tree / flower harkens to much that is familiar with byzantine illuminated
    design, though nothing specific. I was trying to avoid something that would say
    \"byzantine\" too strongly. As for the connection to publishing, well -- you definitely
    have a point. I was again trying to play with the ideas rather than hit you over
    the head with them. Again, maybe it is too vague and undefined. The word PRESS
    is really the only indication.\r\n\r\nAGL,\r\n\r\nThanks as well for the comments.
    As for trying to not be precise / more handrawn look, the silver tree was the
    result of this; the leaves are not round and the curves have been edited freely.
    Not sure how that plays out. The point is the tree and the delicate lines that
    surround it.\r\n\r\nI have played around with the tree quite a bit -- below one
    of the results. It seems totally impractical, but....you tell me. I haven't added
    the flower as of yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tree_Design_052008_6360.jpg]"
