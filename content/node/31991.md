body: "I am considering using Charis SIL, an open source version of Charter, for a
  web site. The semi-slabbed serifs look nice and the Character set and OT features
  are very rich. As importantly, Charis SIL is one of very few Open Font License text
  fonts to come in the four major styles.\r\n\r\nI installed it into my fonts, and
  set it to default in my browser, as an easy \"test drive\" of a variety of text.\r\n\r\nIs
  it a technical problem on my part, or is the font very poorly hinted? I find that
  not only the x-heights, but also stem widths oscillate wildly as it scales from
  the 10-18 pt range.\r\n\r\nFace's background:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charis_(SIL)\r\n\r\nAvailable
  here for those who want to look:\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=CharisSIL_download\r\n\r\nSince
  it is an OFL release, I should be able to simply edit the hinting and rename it.
  But trying to open it directly in FL causes a crash. Opening and resaving in other
  editors fixes this, but probably introduce their own artifacts. The FL autohinting
  after that still creates a rather poor result."

    I've seen what I suppose to have been Charis used for the pronunciations in some
    offset-printed dictionaries, and as far as I remember, it looked pretty good there
    (hinting presumably being irrelevant).\r\n\r\nOlli"

  body: "SIL describes Charis as \"one of the first fonts designed specifically for
    laser printers.\" \r\nIf it was intended for laser printers, not screen display,
    then the hinting should not be expected to be up to the quality of something \"hand-hinted\",
    as Verdana, for example. Even on a 300 dpi laser printer, 11pt is 46 ppm, large
    enough to not worry about exacting manual hinting.\r\n\r\nI briefly looked at
    the hint quality (regular weight only) and the overall color is pretty good, but
    there will be some problems in screen display use. The verical stems are controlled
    fairly well, but many of the horizontal stems and features are left unhinted,
    which is why you'll see some problems with Cap heights and x heights. (e.g., bottom
    of Cap \"F\", top of cap \"H\".) There are other individual issues, \"f\", \"h\"
    are particularly bad, and the combination characters (DZ, Lj, Nj, etc,) show the
    left character hinted, the right char not hinted.\r\n\r\nOverall though, this
    appears to function as I'd expect for a font designed for printing, I'd expect
    the print results should be pretty good overall.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "Jasonb, you caught the same things I did, so I am glad to know it isn't a
    local display problem.The way some characters are fully hinted and some are completely
    ignored was what made me think it might have been a problem on my end, messing
    with it.\r\n\r\nThe issue is certainly irrelevant for print use. The font shines
    there, if you care for it, and I do. The only bummer for me personally is that
    it doesn't shine in screen format. While all fonts have their limits in display
    at small sizes, I would really like to see it up to par with other rich families.\r\n\r\nI
    imagine that SIL has focused on breadth of use while developing their improvements,
    and they claim openly that it is still intended for simple typesetting, only now
    in a wide variety of scripts and languages. Noble goals.\r\n\r\nIt is the only
    exceptionally full font family with a free license. Thanks to this, I can go and
    roll my own version with different hinting, to use or release. Pretty neat stuff.
    If there weren't several thousand glyphs it might not be so intimidating a goal.
    Unfortunately, my hinting skills may never rival the major foundries, as that
    has been less important in my line of type interest. Perhaps I can improve it
    some, and attract others to do likewise.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I think I will
    still use it as the example font for creating images and such where I can anti-alias
    the output in one-off situations. With the OFL license, other site contributors
    can access the font as needed to make their own contributions with a consistent
    look. (I'm working on a wiki.)\r\n\r\nHopefully, some day, an updated version
    would make a great candidate for showcasing the (hypothetical) CSS @font-face
    embedding in web pages. Any year, now."

  body: "I've been looking at Charis SIL myself too.  Rather closely:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.samiam.org/Chortle\r\n\r\nIt's
    a very good font.  The reason why the hinting isn't is because font hinting is
    patented by Apple.  There is more information about the patent problems with hinting
    here:\r\n\r\nhttp://freetype.sourceforge.net/patents.html\r\n\r\nThe way I'm working
    around this patent is by making low-resolution bitmap versions of the font by
    hand using Fontforge.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Charis can be a derivitive of Bitstream
    Charter is that Bitstream Charter (in the basic Roman/Bold/Italic/BoldItalic fonts)
    is a free typeface.  Basically, Bitstream donated Charter to X (a windowing system
    for Unix and Linux) back in 1992 with a copyright that allows free redistribution
    and modification.  In fact, Bitstream Charter is, to the extent of my knowledge,
    the only truly open source font by Matt Carter.\r\n\r\nYou may notice, when compared
    to Charter, that Charis has slightly thicker strokes; it's a little more bold
    (Charter slightly-semi-bold).  Also, the accents are more rounded at the top than
    the accents in Charter proper.\r\n\r\nAlso, Charis isn't the only open-source
    (free to download, modify, and re-distribute) font with Regular/Bold/Italic/BoldItalic
    fonts.  There are a few other attractive open-source typeface with R/G/B/BI support:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bitstream.com/font_rendering/products/dev_fonts/vera.html\r\n\r\nhttp://dejavu.sourceforge.net/
    Vera derivitive with good Unicode support and an oblique version of Vera serif\r\n\r\nhttp://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/~panov/cm-unicode/
    \ TTF/OTF conversions of the fonts that comes with TeX\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ellak.gr/fonts/mgopen/index.en.html
    Some greek fonts with English (but, alas, usually not accented letter) support.\r\n\r\nAnd
    some maybe open-source fonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.greekfontsociety.org/pages/en_typefaces20th.html\r\n\r\nThe
    GFS claims that DidotOT is an OFL font.  However, the actual zipfile doesn't have
    an OFL license in it.\r\n\r\nftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/hmiller/fonts/Thryomanes11.zip\r\n\r\nThis
    font is supposibly GPL, which is a great license for software but a lousy license
    for fonts.  The GPL doesn't answer questions like \"Can I embed parts of the font
    in a non-GPL compatible PDF file\" or \"Can I use the program with a non-GPL compatible
    program like Microsoft Word\", and the source code requirement is a non-issue
    when just about any font can be opened by just about any font editor.\r\n\r\n-

    last fall--but then disappointed when it didn't have small caps or old-style numerals.
    But I guess that's understandable, too, given the primary goals of the font (or
    is there some other reason, perhaps?).\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Matthew Carter himself

    all those years ago, but I wonder if Matthew was aware he was donating the font
    with a license that allow derivitives like Charis to pop up years later.\r\n\r\nInfact,
    it's legal to make a straight up true type version of the bitstream Charter font
    and put it (or even sell it) on a web page.  This may not be what Bitstream had
    in mind when giving Bitstream to X, especially since Bitstream still sells the
    Charter font.\r\n\r\nIf you want small caps and old style numbers, you can buy

  body: "\"It\u2019s a very good font. The reason why the hinting isn\u2019t is because
    font hinting is patented by Apple.\"\r\n\r\nThis isn't entirely true. Apple's
    patent has to do with using delta hints, and as far as I know, it restricts rendering
    systems from processing delta hints, not fonts from containing them.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, though, it's not the lack of delta hints that make this font render
    less than ideally at display sizes. I can see many instances where features and
    strokes are left completely uncontrolled, instead of applying bsaic TrueType instructions.
    These instructions are part of the base TT instruction set, are not patented,
    and do not rely on delta hints.  \r\nThe font doesn't display well at small size
    simply because it wasn't intended to. If you wanted the font to perform better
    at display sizes, you could improve it's display quite a bit, even without using
    delta hints.\r\n\r\nJason C"
