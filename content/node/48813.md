  store. They currently have a logo but are seeking to become more modernized as the
  area around them picked up and is starting to get \"hip\". I've tried all kinds
  of things and cant really come up with anything I like. I do think the words themselves
  are more important than any mark. The name just doesn't feel like it requires a
  mark. Please take a look and give me some feedback!\r\n\r\nold\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cook_remake_5851.gif]\r\n\r\nnew\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mockphile_4451.gif]\r\n"

  body: "i dont get the love your thing, i mean the 2nd mark.\r\n\r\ntype-wise it
    really depends on what you're going.\r\nunderware have \"bello\" and \"sauna\"
    which i think are very friendly/playful.\r\n\r\nif thats not what you're after,
    then finding a good substitute for helvetica shouldn't be too hard. there's so
    much great type happening all over the world at the moment, your biggest challenge
    would be trying to chose the one you like the best.\r\n\r\nalso custom type as
    suggested by Ratbaggy is a great idea but thats if you know what you're doing
    and what you want to achieve.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, Ratbaggy's absolutely right, the
    best way to start is by sketching your ideas on paper without the computer. It
    hurts me to see a lot of designers avoiding that stage and going directly to the
    machine.\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\n\r\nVictor\r\n"

    for the treatment: I think American Apparel already took your intellectual space
    with this one.\r\n\r\nAlso, I remember the old packaging design from the Pathmark
    supermarkets from growing up in New Jersey. The store brand items were in white
    boxes, and the name of the product was in black Helvetica. At the bottom of the
    box were the trademark red and blue stripes of the Pathmark brand, and then in
    black Helvetica the phrase \"no frills.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's nothing
    very epicurean about that.\r\n\r\nPeople who like to cook are passionate about
    sensory experience. I should know; I like to cook. Helvetica doesn't exactly communicate
    gustatory passion.\r\n\r\nThat said, the oven is cute. Overall, I'm not feeling
    this direction, though.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    the new one to be better or vice versa. Neue narrows more in parts, has a higher
    dot on the 'i' and a fatter apostrophe. Why would that make it better? Excuse
    me if I sound ignorant - but I guess I am.\r\n\r\nAs for the treatment - be careful
    of immediate\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_crateandbarrel_4010.gif]\r\n\r\ncomparisons.
    That was the first thing I thought of.\r\n\r\nAnd the stove reference is vague.\r\n\r\nThat
    said the neutralness of a typeface such as Helvetica may convey the modern feel
    you want - then it would all come down to the application. I would research the
    alternates first though."

    kind of liked the idea and wanted to there to be some contrast, hence the simple
