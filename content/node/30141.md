  I'll have to go back to the store and get another copy.\r\nMight even be tempted
  to go searching for the original card packages.\r\nBook + selection of great music
  from 1927-31.\r\nAnd as a bonus, the main type is Caslon's Egyptian by the book's
  designer Miko McGinty.\r\nGoes great with Crumb's lovely bold sans lettering (strangely,
  a lot in common with Dr Seuss...)\r\nI like the way McGinty uses the \"alternate\"
  version of the G, without crossbar, throughout.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crumb_4568.jpg]"
