  culture and arts. Every two years they award two foundations, associations, persons
  or companies for their contribution in local arts and culture.\r\nThe brief was
  to design a poster which needs to stand out amongst other posters in pubs, council
  buildings et cetera.\r\n\r\nAny critique anyone?"

  body: "Overall, I like it.\r\nThe PDF was better suited for a more in deep critique.\r\nMaybe
    in a dimly light pub some of the type could prove too light or with not enough
    contrast.\r\nWhat's the purple stroke under the first word?"

  body: "Thanks Riccardo,\r\nI've added the PDF.\r\n\r\nI see your point about the
    contrast and will think about the colours again.\r\n\r\nThe purple stroke is to
    indicate you have to start reading at that position. Also it is meant to balance
    the (same) colour in the lower right corner. Do you think it's too much? Perhaps
    just colour the first word(s)?"

  body: "Despite the messy layout, which is the clich\xE9 for \"art\", this seems
    off target. \r\nUnless sports are considered cultural, or the prize really is
    the trophy, the image -- raising a trophy -- is wrong, as it signifies sport,
    not art.\r\nIt doesn't relate to the text, having nothing to do with voting, as
    sports are determined by scores, not votes.\r\n\r\nSure, it's a metaphor, but
    it's not been fleshed out, nor handled with any wit.\r\nIn fact, it looks like
    you're apologizing for the metaphor, by making it blurry, hoping viewers won't
    notice it's wrong.\r\n\r\nFurther to the unstructured layout, this is a lazy and
    decorative way to say \"art\", in lieu of a strong idea rendered simply and directly."

  body: "Wow, Nick, strong opinion there, but, this post is here for me to get critique,
    so thanks!\r\n\r\nI myself am not sure about the image too, it was the last thing
    added in the design and it therfore problably got the least attention. Shame on
    me! I'll look into it. You're right ofcourse, it's not about sports...\r\n\r\nAs
    for the messy layout, would the overal design benefit from more background structure
    (like gradients, shading and lines) or would it make just more messy?\r\n\r\nHowever,
    keep in mind that 99% of competing posters in local pubs consist of terrible,
    terrible design, which is really terrible (yes, I said it trice), made with Arial
    and/or Verdana... To stand out of these atrocities to the human eye, I am looking
    for something 'je ne sais quoi' (that being a problem in itself), something 'different'. "

  body: "Glad you appreciate the critique, Jean Paul.\r\nYou're right, the \"non-grid\"
    layout and nicely spaced and placed typography will position the poster well against
    competing media.\r\nStyle, executed with taste, can be very effective.\r\nAnd
    there is something celebratory about the \"explosive\" layout, like a confetti
    canon (at a sports event--why don't they do that at arts awards!).\r\nNonetheless,
    I still think that if you could find an image or concept that was on track (there's
    always champagne), it would give a stronger purpose to the piece, and if not,
    perhaps drop the image or make it totally abstract, pure style."

  body: The trophy metaphor doesn't bother me. Even though it's primarily associated
    with sports, it's also a general symbol for victory/winning. But the champagne
    idea is very good and has the potential to be more dynamic.

  body: "Thanks for your comments guys!\r\n\r\n@ Nick, JamesM: I'll defenitely look
    into a different image. The more I think about it, the less I like the trophy.
    \r\n\r\n@ Igor: Should I change the magenta to orange? (Mind you, the Dutch only
    won because of Brasil's own goal!)\r\n\r\n@ JamesP: Maybe you're right and the
    typography needs to be a little less gimmickry. I do feel I went crazy, but hey,
    I think it's better to go all the way the first time and then tone it down rather
    than the other way around. And when you say I'm creating an atrocity on the other
    end of the spectrum, I've reached my brief halfway I think. Though personally
    I don't see it as an eyesore.\r\n\r\nI spoke two of the three members of the Platform
    yesterday evening and they said they were both very pleasantly surprised, not
    at all what they expected. Makes me want to continue with it anyway...\r\n"

  body: "I have to agree with James and Nick. I think that this is too messy, and
    there is too much going on, with too little contrast and hierarchy. Remember this
    is a poster, not a booklet. Trz to limit the text to the essential, and make a
    clear hierarchy of importance. This must not neccesarily become a gridded poster,
    but try to make the poster feel more logical, less incidental. About the colour
    scheme: to my eyes it feels too... stuffy somehow, not very fresh, and I think
    in low contrast environments it might not stand out as much as you might want.
    See the grey version attached to understand what I mean. Also try to tune down
    the type, there is too much going on and it does not help communicate. The headline
    is a bit too quirky to my taste, with letters jumping up and down from the baseline
    in order to make them stick... It all reminds me a bit of emigr\xE9, in an anarchistic
    kind of way, but not quite there yet in terms of quality. I\"ll give you one thing
    though: it does not look ordinary.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grey_6616.png]"
