  SHADOW. We're a sign making business and have a product line that enhances the shadow
  lines built into the font. I am looking for suggestions for fonts using the same
  or similar shadow effects. \r\n\r\nPicture of an IMPRING MT SHADOW font attached.\r\n\r\nThank

    onto Myfonts.com and search for \"tooled\", \"handtooled\", or \"inline\" to find
    lots."
