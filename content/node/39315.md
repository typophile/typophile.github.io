  separate files along with pertinent graphics files for each chapter. In preparation
  to go to prepress with a PDF, I've had the following questions arise: \r\n\r\n1)
  Must I create one master Indesign file with all of the chapters using the book option
  in Indesign? Or can I create a pdf file for each chapter and then merge all of the
  individual pdf chapters into one master PDF? Are there any potential output snags
  in the latter option?\r\n\r\n2) Do the graphics files that are linked to each chapter
  automatically embed when Indesign prints to PDF?\r\n\r\nThanks, Jim"

    my experience) prefer packaged indesign files set up in reader spreads rather
    than a PDF, just so they can handle (with more flexibility) the setup on the press
    sheet. \r\n\r\nto answer question 2 yes all images and fonts should embed (be
    sure to use the \"Press Quality\" output option)"

    that complicated. If you could get somebody to talk you through the the process,
    and later do a detailed check, that would be ideal. Then next time you could handle
    it on your own. \r\n\r\n\"..can I create a pdf file for each chapter and then
    merge all of the individual pdf chapters\"\r\n\r\nBeyond the production aspect,
    that would give you a sense of how the publication flows. I think you should probably
    do it for that reason."

  body: "I have limited experience with book production, but I do know that printers
    prefer to work with a section at a time, to facilitate their workflow. So your
    designer is right on track with using separate files for each chapter. It's also
    a lot easier on editors and proofreaders.\r\n\r\nAnd then you always have the
    option of putting the chapterfiles in an InDesign Book-file. Just do some reading
    up on the Book-feature\u2026 Information vcan be found under Help/InDesign help\u2026\r\n\r\nBTW:
    The best way to get a sense of flow is to print everything at 100% (spreads!)
    and place or paste or pin them in sequence someplace where you can look everything
    over in peace.\r\nMaking a dummy also works ; )\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

    a quarter of a century ago I did a whole series of computer game books, here in
    the NL's. But that was in the paste up era\u2026\r\nSomehow I got mixed up in
    a different area of design, mostly mags and newsletters and such and only did
    a couple of books in the last decades. But I keep my eyes and ears open and try
    to learn as much as possible.<grin>\r\nAnd if everything goes my way I am going
    to be active in book design next year, after a two year sabbatical.\r\n\r\n. .

  body: Always ask your printer what they want. The book printers I use like the whole
    book as one file--reader spreads if supplied as working files, single pages if
    supplied in pdf. Printers are happy to give you detailed specs as to what pdf
    options to use in jobs supplied to them.

    with Abi... You can use the Preflight and Package features to collect each chapter's
    files for output from within InDesign... That way you will be able to give your
    printer the InDesign files and the image and font files that belong with each
    chapter.\r\n\r\nIf you do choose to go the PDF route, make sure you select Press
    quality, as stated above. If you have any images that bleed off the sides of the
    pages, you will need to check the appropriate boxes for bleeds and printer's marks...
    But in my opinion, it's safer to send them the packaged INDD files."
