body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nJust wanted recommendations for a body-titling pair for
  a Renaissance-themed website: they must be licensable as webfonts. Preferably something
  Venetian.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using Palatino + IM Fell English. Horrible choice,
  I know.\r\n\r\nFor body text, I'm currently looking at Adobe Jenson Pro (Adobe),
  Requiem (H&FJ; not yet a webfont, but I can wait) and Venetian 301 (Bitstream version
  of Centaur). Out of these only Jenson Pro renders as well as a system font (eg Palatino).
  I don't know how the rest will display, but this is very important as well.\r\n\r\nFor
  headings I want something rough like IM Fell English, and it must also have an authentic
  italic like Fell English. I was thinking GLC Garamond.\r\n\r\nAlso: is Garamond
  an actual Renaissance design?\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!"
