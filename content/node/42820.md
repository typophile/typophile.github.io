  body: "Amazingly close, and such that it helps greatly. Thanks!\r\nI've looked through
    all Vivaldi, Vivienne, and Vivacious\r\nfonts available as they are all strikingly
    similar. \r\n\r\nThey all seem to be missing the \"solid\" upper-case G. \r\nNo
    matter, Illustrator to the rescue. \r\n\r\nMany thanks, again."
