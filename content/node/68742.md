    some early psychological evidence for the benefits of good typography and type
    selection.

    [Kevin]\r\n\r\nSo that's why you weathered the font display issues so gracefully.\r\n\r\nKevin,
    I thought the presentation was an excellent summary of your involvement in font
    issues so far.\r\n\r\nWhat science was used to motivate the ClearType spacing
    work? What kind of algorithm is used in the implementation?"

    pain killers;). \r\n\r\nWhat's odd about your presentation's content, from (Dawn
    and the Differentiations, almost to the end), is the insistence of You and the
    Researchers, on telling the subject, (and the audience) \u2014 what they should
    think of the options, and then reinforcement of the \"good\" answers, e.g. \"...and
    there was one crazy person who liked the document on the left\" \u2014\_Kevin.
    Was that 1 Crazy Person the author of the 2000 document on Al Queda? I.E. is there
    no document for any purpose that should have the form of the document on the left?
    Then, the Corsiva vs. Times... whew! I'd like to suggest a differentiation study
    between Corsiva and Times Italic, first;)\r\n\r\nThe big thing is, that there
    is not enough separation in design between the fonts being tested, relative to
    the differentiation being suggested. And then, there is too much difference between
    the \"good\" and \"bad\" documents being suggested, with insufficient context.
    \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "> What science was used to motivate the ClearType spacing work? What kind
    of algorithm is used in the implementation?\r\n\r\nThe ClearType spacing work
    was done not long after the invention of ClearType (before I joined the team),
    but getting it into the operating system required a fundamental change to the
    graphics platform. With the older versions of ClearType every glyph had to start
    and end on a full pixel boundary which limits how well the spacing between letters
    can be controlled. If a glyph naturally wants to use 6.8 horizontal pixels of
    space, then that glyph will use 7 pixels of horizontal space. And most every glyph
    has some sort of rounding error. The new version, which we call sub-pixel positioned
    ClearType, allows us to start and end glyphs on fractional boundaries. A glyph
    that wants 6.8 pixels of space can have 6.83 pixels of space. DirectWrite is the
    new graphics platform that is allowing application to have sub-pixel positioned
    ClearType. Applications have to be written for DirectWrite as the older graphics
    engine (GDI) isn\u2019t going away. Both Firefox and IE have announced plans to
    use DirectWrite in future versions.\r\n\r\nMore info on DirectWrite:\r\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/02/13/advances-in-typography-and-text-rendering-in-windows-7.aspx\r\n"

    can be controlled.</em>\r\n\r\nI would rephrase that. In terms of <em>control,</em>
    full pixel spacing actually provided more control via hinted widths than typical
    subpixel positioning does. What subpixel positioning enables is closer overall
    fidelity to natural glyph spacing -- just as ClearType outline rendering provides
    closer overall fidelity to natural glyph shape -- through increased x-direction
    resolution. The argument for sub-pixel positioning is really that it reduces the
    need for the kind of control required in full-pixel spacing environments (which
    CT without sub-pixel spacing simply broke). The lesson here is that however you
    render shapes should also be the way you render spacing, and I'm glad MS is finally
    doing this.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Verdana and Georgia, typefaces that was designed
    and hinted for both full-pixel shape rendering and full-pixel shaping, continue
    to look better and seem to be more readable in CT with sub-pixel positioning than
    most other fonts should provoke one of those moments in which we all think carefully."

    distances. So whether those are better suited to print or to screen depends on
    the individual font. Leaving aside the wisdom of hiring people to design typefaces
    with the brief \u2018look good on screen <em>and</em> in print\u2019.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS.
    You left out the bit where Peter Karow = Cassandra, prophecies the fall of the
    house of alias before the war even begins, but no one listens.\r\n"
