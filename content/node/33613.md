body: "hi,\r\ni'm working on my first text typeface and after skecthing out the first
  glyphs I've printed out of fontlab a couple of words to have an intial feel and
  see the weight of the characters and figure out the needed adjusments and variations.
  For the same purpose I've generated a font so i could look at it as a paragraph
  in Indesign and the printout looks totally different: bulky, blurred, much thicker
  than the fontlab version.\r\nThen I generated a pdf file from the indesign file,
  print it out and get still another result. This time the typeface is closer to what
  I was expecting but ligther than the fontlab version.\r\n\r\nI've attached a file
  with the scans of the three printouts and a pdf with the actual font imbedded .
  Printer settings and paper are the same in the three situations.\r\n \r\nCan anyone
  help me understand what's going on?"
