  best known for. Started with the top one and ended with bottom. any feedback would
  be appreciate.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about playing adding an AE ligature not sure
  if it will look right though, what you think?"

  body: "I'm not sure how this name is pronounced, but I'm guessing at <em>kie-ah-NET-oh</em>
    or <em>kie-ah-NEAT-oh</em>. Either way, I think the <strong>AE</strong> ligature
    will make it harder to figure out how to say it. \r\nTo me, the real problem is
    the <strong>N</strong>, because it looks like a Greek letter pi. My two cents'
    worth is, use version #2, substitute a more conventional <strong>N</strong>, and
    use the funky-but-legible <strong>A</strong> and <strong>O</strong> from version
    #1."

- body: "It looks like a teenage eighties pop band that calls themselves \"heavy metal\"
    and doesn't wear shirts on stage. They know three chords and refuse to admit they're
    wearing mascara. The lead singer \"Spitfire\" has a lick-on tattoo that he puts
    on every morning and his real name is Chad. He collects toy dragons and has never
    beaten his little sister at chess.\r\n\r\nIn other words - what the heck is this
    logo for? Is my impression the one you want? The odd name and the dagger style
    could work for some applications, but it doesn't work at all if it's not communicating
    visually the thing you want it to.\r\n\r\nIs it a video game? A band? A comic
    book hero? A medieval costume designer? A Harry Potter villain?  Because I really
    have no idea. IMHO, this is a much bigger problem than ligatures. If you walk
    through the kids books in Borders, you'll see tons of covers with this style in
    the young boys section. Is that your target market? If so, you've done well. \r\n\r\nCan
    you give us any information to figure out what you're trying to achieve?"

  body: "yeah, well its a clothing line for gamers. kind of like roxy is for girl
    surfers. the fon't is already sort of well established, but I gave enough push
    to get a make over on it. I don't want to give it a 360 makeover because that
    would be to much of a shell shock to marketing. this is the dilemma. not going
    to far, but far enough to make it look good.\r\n\r\nwww.kiaeneto.com is the website
    if that helps.\r\nsite is getting an overhaul too since it looks like its from
    the 90's hah ;["

  body: "I think you should focus on keeping the dot \"i\" star and inside \"O\" star.
    The N is awfull you should change it to someting more readable. I'm not shure
    about the A, i'm not a fan of the original One, but maybe changing it like you
    do is going too far, as for the change of the T, i also don't like the original
    one, but i think you change it too much.\r\nAnother thing, if you decide to change
    the A for a more classic form like you did - wich i'm not sure is a good idea,
    classic look for gamers teenager.... - you should also correct the E to match
    the style of the A\r\nthat's for my two cents advices: keep the star - you might
    try versions that focus on it - , correct the N and try to slightly enhance the
    typo.\r\n\r\n good luck with this project."
