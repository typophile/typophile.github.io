  name for the pilcrow... I am looking for a good name for my book design company
  that I am about to establish; I've had lots of ideas, unfortunately, as it is common
  with ideas - many people have them, and the choice is not so satisfactory.\r\n\r\nEh,
  anyway, could anyone help me with this? I am getting a bit desperate.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nprzemek debowski"

  body: "I didn't know that \"calderon\" is the Spanish one, in Italian if we say
    \"calderone\" it means \"a group of messed up things\", \"putting together ideas
    in a confused way\"; if we say \"to put everything in the same 'calderone'\" then
    it means \"to consider/mistake different discordant things in the same way\".
    \ What about \"Dostaa\" ?  I loved Chimera restaurant in Krakow.\r\n\r\nSzczescie,\r\nAS"
