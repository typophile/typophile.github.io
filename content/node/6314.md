body: Hello again <BR> <BR>Just came back from holidays and a lot of work is waiting.  <BR>One
  of them it is about a freelancer whose subject is &#34;space sculpting&#34;.  <BR>Actually
  she is making the work of an interior designer but she also  <BR>works for public
  places as squares and monuments.  <BR>So she is arranging the space in an artistic
  and functional way, let&#39;s say.  <BR> <BR>As you see I have two solutions.  <BR>In
  Aii the idea is to use the 5 colours you see and each time to apply one of them
  as a background colour of the media.  <BR>The sequence of the colours remains the
  same but the &#34;colour-bar&#34; moves as one of the colours becomes the same with
  background. <BR> <BR>I am looking forward to read your comments. <BR> <BR>christos

  body: Your solutions on the top left convery the idea of space better than the other
    two. Top right looks like a graphic designer or web designer&#39;s identity. The
    bottom solutions talk more about architecture, engineering, or drafting &#40;but
    not so successfully, in my opinion&#41; <BR> <BR>In your top right designs, you
    use Gill Sans &#40;?&#41;. I think that this is a much better type treatment than
    the Helvetica in the top left. <BR> <BR>So, I&#39;d like to see the top left with
    Gill Sans, and more airyness or space somehow

  body: 'Hi Dan. I think you are right about the choice of types. Gills work better,
    and sure the most conveying solution to the subject is the top left one.  <BR>
    <BR>Furthermore i see now that i should add this information to my introduction:
    The customer has a special system to approach the customer&#39;s needs. She is
    letting them making a wide variety of generic choices such as favorite colour,
    book, place etc. so then she can accustom her work depending on the character
    of the customer. The 2nd solution is inspired from this process &#40;maybe in
    a complicated way -so not suxessfuly&#41;. <BR> <BR>christos'
