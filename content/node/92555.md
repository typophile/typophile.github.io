body: "Hi. I'm looking to see if anyone can help me ID the font used here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.semanticarecords.com/\r\n\r\nIt
  doesn't look like a default web font due to its modular composition, and the fact
  that the page source code's only CSS class with font settings are like so:\r\n\r\n.Estilo5
  {font-size: 10px}\r\n\r\n..which is not a web font. Seems to be part of a custom
  font markup tool. I've also looked all over the web for a typeface with any variation
  of \"estilo5\", and nothing comes close to looking like it.\r\n\r\nAny pointers
  would be greatly appreciated!"

    \u201Cestilo\u201D means \u201Cstyle\u201D in Spanish, what you see in the CSS
    is the name of some classes which set the size of whatever font is being specified
    before."

      of the page, but thanks for the link - 'bitmap' was the keyword I hadn't thought
      of."
