  body: "You've just hit one of my projects, so I'm going to go on a bit, and probably
    ramble. Hope the information is worth that.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nWe need to know
    if these are *manuscripts* or not, Your use of the term \"double spaced\" suggests
    the are. If so, the most important consideration is \"Are all the needed characters
    available?\" And that means \"Charter\" as exemplified by the SIL font family
    Charis. It may not be as pretty as Yoga or Guardian -- though I can argue that,
    too. (In case you didn't know it, Charter was designed by Matthew Carter, and
    it is hard not to gush about his work.)\r\n\r\nHere is an analogy. If you're a
    typesetter, you might do beautiful work. But if you make typos, you are unemployed.
    The first requirement is to get the words spelled right. If you can't clear that
    hurdle, all other skills are meaningless. It is similar with a typeface: if it
    doesn't have the character sets you need, dump it.\r\n\r\nFF as a foundry now
    has a policy that you can't modify their fonts, which includes adding characters.
    They want to do the work and charge you for it. SIL Charis is open source. We
    recommend it to university press editorial departments, where the editor works
    on the author's files, preparing them for composition. To date (except for manuscripts
    having Greek), the only characters lacking were some vowels for Comanche. \r\n\r\nIt
    gets a little more complicated if these are finished pieces, as opposed to \"manuscript
    files.\" I've made up a Charis roman and italic for print, adding old-style numbers,
    a lot of kerning, redrawing ligatures, adding OT features, etc. Nice fonts, we've
    now used them for two books. Charis prints a bit better than Charter (which wasn't
    designed when computer-to-plate offset was the norm).  But the hinting is lacking,
    and I haven't the skill to do that work. That means PDFs as a final, distributable
    product (one kind of ebook) may not show as well as with some other fonts. I'm
    trying to get somebody in the AAUP to volunteer to learn hinting. If we can get
    that, we'll have a very good looking, free, open source font family.\r\n\r\nI'd
    suggest you download Charis and see for yourself. If for some reason you want
    a copy of my version, that would be fine. Bear in mind that as a typesetter, I
    do work on fonts as needed, so \"our\" Charis is a work in progress."

  body: "frode frank - I like the way they look on screen and in print from office
    printers -- somewhat modern but not too distinctive.  Although in the case of
    Guardian Egyptian I've only used PDF specimens from the vendor. For Yoga it's
    a PDF from the vendor plus I have a book set in Yoga that looks great, and came
    with a letter from the publisher in Yoga that wasn't printed very well and looks
    good too.\r\n\r\ncharles_e - ITC Charter has all the characters I need. This scares
    me: \"That means PDFs as a final, distributable product (one kind of ebook) may
    not show as well as with some other fonts\" since I'm giving my some teachers
    PDFs of some of my stuff and don't know if they print them or look at them on
    screen."

    they look? What tone should it have? What needs should the typeface help solve?
    How is the hierarchy organized? What's the topic of the paper?

  body: "Usually about two levels of heading, plus a title page. Maybe one or three
    levels rarely. Occassionally tables, for which I could use the same type or a
    sans face. Fairly serious but (ideally) not boring. Some numbers but no math formulas.
    Typeface is supposed to be \"Times New Roman\" or something similar but a good
    text serif should be OK. It can't draw attention to itself but I hope it looks
    pretty. \r\n\r\nOften printed on an office laser printer or viewed on a screen.
    Possibly printed on an inkjet printer.\r\n\r\nTypically double spaced. I've been
    using Plantin 11pts with 28pt leading usually, but my version of Plantin requires
    switching fonts for certain things, so I'm looking to get new Open Type font where
    I can set it to treat numbers a certain way. In my case, the topic is libraries
    and information science.\r\n\r\nI'd like the feeling to similar to what you'd
    get in a business magazine or news paper - say the Economist or something like
    that.  Though the type in that magazine is too small.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Aha. Nick made a point in [[http://typophile.com/node/71559|this recent thread]]
    that news faces should be dispassionate and authoritative, due to the nature of
    the content. You\u2019re not doing news design, but I think the same need for
    authority applies. \r\n\r\nLooking at Yoga, I personally feel it has a bit to
    much character for your purpose. Guardian Egyptian looks like a better choice
    \u2014 it\u2019s more neutral \u2014 and the various versions (headline, sans,
    agate) makes it very versatile family.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a huge gap between
    Guardian Egyptian and Plantin, and the latter is definitely closer to Times New
    Roman. Check out [[http://klim.co.nz/galcop_samples.php|this]] for an Opentype
    version of Plantin, btw! \r\n\r\n"

  body: "When I design books in the social sciences, I often use Charter or Charis.
    Arnhem Blond would be another choice -- Rich Hendel uses it. I can't get it to
    work. That happens often to designers, they can get certain types to work for
    them, but not others. Presuming the typefaces are appropriate to the subject,
    a different designer can have just the opposite experience. \r\n\r\nYou will not
    like my thinking about typefaces for the social sciences. The stereotypical social
    sciences book is Times with Helvetica display. Stereotypical because circa 1970-80,
    that's what was used. And for the reasons you gave. No, not all books of course.
    Moral: It became comfortable to that audience. Now Times/Helvetica have become
    such a stereotype that this has sunk in, even to an audience not accustomed to
    thinking in terms of type. So translate what was comfortable in 1970 to 2010,
    an you get your answer.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of offending about 90 percent of the
    people who read this, book interiors -- academic papers -- are not a matter of
    Graphic Design. They are a matter of presenting the author's arguments to a readership.
    Go check Beatrice Warde. \"Pretty\" is not a factor, at worst, it is distracting,
    at best, neutral. Now if you are in the commercial world, getting someone to buy
    the book is a concern. But that isn't you. You sound like a student. If you can
    borrow some authority for your arguments by selecting a typeface familiar to those
    in your field, that's a good thing. And if you're trying to sell academic monographs,
    remember they aren't displayed at the bookstore. There are few *graphic* elements
    in these books -- papers --that can affect sales. \"Disgustingly ugly\" would
    be one, but that judgment would have to come from an audience not particularly
    attuned to \"graphic design\" and the latest trendy typefaces."

  body: "Charles, my feeling is that no roman type at text sizes is really \"pretty\",
    including Jensen. The beauty of individual glyphs are only really seen at larger
    sizes, generally over 12 point. What is seen at text sizes, though, is the texture
    on the page, and the look of words, and that has an aesthetic impact and carries
    a lot of feelings subliminally that I think you have given short shrift in your
    comment. Feelings such as of authority of the text are not a matter of familiarity
    alone, but also design. \r\n\r\nForrest, I would caution you against making decisions
    only on the basis of viewing type on line. The beauty of large type on the screen
    is a really deceptive guide to how it will look in text sizes on the page. You'd
    best look at books you admire to know what your setting will look like. When working
    on my own Caslon revival, I felt I had to constantly resist the temptation to
    make it look more elegant on the screen (by increasing contrast) because I think
    that would have affected both readability and the aesthetic I wanted at small
    sizes. "

    the AAUP community for the times a Caslon is right. In fact, I already have.\r\n\r\n*
    * *\r\n\r\nI view interior design similar to set design. Audience counts for a
    lot. But in the case of books, the presentation isn't as crucial an element as
    in a theater set (you don't have an actor searching vainly for the door the script
    tells him he is suppose to be exiting), and the designer should take less upon
    themselves, certainly if their is no author involvement.\r\n\r\nAs to Jensen in
    <cite>The Pacific,</cite> a second grumble is the quote marks. Frequently closer
    to the preceding word than to the word beginning the quote. I'll allow it colored
    my judgment. On the other hand, I was having lunch with Rich Hendel and mentioned
    the book was set in Jenson. He is not a dramatic fellow; the water spewed on the
    table cloth was a genuine reaction. On reflection, it is best not to make such
    design comments when someone is eating or drinking.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nFor at
    least one example of Charter in a social sciences book, see <cite>Behind the Backlash:
    White Working-Class Politics in Baltimore, 1940-1980.</cite> "
