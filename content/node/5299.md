body: <i>First of all, sorry, if this may not be suitable for a public forum, but
  anyway.:</i> <BR> <BR>So, Ive signed up for FontShops KeyWording Project, a few
  weeks ago; Ive keyworded <BR>around 51 Fonts, to try the whole keywording system,
  and then I contacted FontShop <BR>&#40; Two times, by now &#41; to ask for my &#39;Reward&#39;,
  a single FontFont, free of charge, <BR>like they state, wherever they advertise
  and &#39;recruit&#39; for their project, and, Nothing.. <BR>No response, no reaction,
  and, certainly, no reward.. <BR><i>&#40; Maybe it just takes some time, for them,
  but no reaction, at all, within the last weeks, <BR>is not quite what I expected..
  &#41;</i> <BR> <BR>Anybody else experienced any problems with keywording typefaces
  for FontShop, <BR>and / or &#39;exchanging&#39; their services for FontFonts.? <BR>
  <BR><i>&#40; If any Typophile Admin has a problem with me posting this in here,
  please feel free to delete / move / remove this thread.. Thanks, and, Hmm, Sorry..

    the program is still active and they do want to respond to all  <BR>email they
    receive. If there is ever a lapse in communication they  <BR>urge keyworders to
    call their toll-free number: 1'
