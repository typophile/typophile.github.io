body: "This is a rubbing off a cemetery marker. I need to match it to add the date
  of death (this is what I do for a living). There are only a handful of standard
  typefaces used in the cemetery monument industry, and interestingly, the most commonly
  used ones have no clear relationship to any of the most commonly used, or \"historic\"
  faces in the print industry. That's another topic all together.\r\n\r\nBig open
  counters, strong contrast in weight of horizontal and vertical strokes, exceptionally
  high crossbar on lower case e, and a very strange and ugly contrast in character
  width...all appear condensed unless they are round, in which case they are perfectly
  round.\r\n\r\nThis particular face cannot be matched by any of the current CAD systems
  at the monument companies in our area, so I'm hoping that in this case, it's an
  identifiable font from the print industry that I can find and copy or purchase or
  reproduce by hand.\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated. Thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/johnston-rubbing_5738.jpg]"

  body: Thank you and yes, it's a bit of a thankless job. Not only does the real customer
    ever really see it (as far as we know), but even the family members who visit
    generally have more on the mind than how well the lettering guy did his job. So
    appreciate my own work, and that's about where it ends.
