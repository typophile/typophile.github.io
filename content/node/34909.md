    name=\"Q_16\"><strong>And logos of sports teams?</strong></a>\r\nThere you have
    to keep in mind that sports merchandising -- everything from baseball caps to
    soccer jerseys -- is big business, so the popular sports teams have every reason
    to make their logo as difficult to imitate as possible. Most of them are custom
    designed or use heavily customized existing fonts."

    learnt that so many jersey typefaces are based heavily on existing fonts. so I
