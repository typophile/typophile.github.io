  old.\r\n\r\nI originally received this font, Boxie, about 1990-1991. I cannot locate
  any information as to who made it who owns it or anything else. Nor can I locate
  a clean copy of it -At some point I attempted to edit the font and damaged it. It
  does not work under OSX. It will work, mostly, under OS9 but has weird artifacts
  and behaviours. \r\nI would like to find out who made it and what the ownership
  is as well as obtain an unmodified copy of it.\r\nI am attaching screenshots from
  Keycaps in OS9.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\r\nThank you."

  body: "Tiffany's idea of using a more modern equivalent is a good one -- it will
    help you avoid those OS glitches -- but I think I've seen some fonts when I was
    doing keywording for FontShop that looked almost identical to your sample. I can't
    recall which foundry they were from, but they looked just like this sort of square
    dot-matrix printer typefaces from the 80's, but not made up of dots -- just like
    this sample you posted.\r\n\r\nMaybe if Stephen is around he can help remind me
    where this came from?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Stephen, but no, that's not it -- I didn't work on E+F fonts. I've
    been trying to look over the foundries that I did the keywording for, and I've
    looked at the samples for most of them since starting to work on this thread,
    but I haven't come across it. It's making me a little crazy, because I'm sure
    I saw a family of fonts that remind me a lot of this font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
