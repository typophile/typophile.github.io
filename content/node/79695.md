  body: As for the older design, I believe the sans is Akzidenz Grotesk. You'll have
    to provide a larger scan of the body text for help on that score.

  body: "Thank you so much for your responses. Here are higher-res images of the body
    texts (before and after redesign) - although I think you guys have solved the
    redesigned type. I had to crop them in order to get them under 3MB for posting
