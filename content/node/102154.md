body: "I'm working on a project in which I have almost two complete sets of A through
  Z in upper and lower case. I can probably come up with number alternates also. They
  are all viable glyphs. So, is it better to go with two fonts or one font with an
  alternate range - through the miracle of open type. Which is preferable to the type
  and font using community?\r\n"

  body: "Well, here's one way to think about it, from a potential user's perspective.
    If the glyphs are intended to interact, they should be in one font, so kerning
    is possible. If not, two fonts is easier.\r\n\r\nWhen, early on, Adobe put out
    \"Adobe Garamond\" with the titling glyphs in the font, & you were suppose to
    turn them on with an OT feature, I took them out & made a separate font. You would
    not want the two to interact, and accidents happen when setting type..."

    font?

  body: "@bbg: Not all software applications recognize opentype features - sign specific
    and some CAD software for instance. There are a lot of users who can't afford
    the huge cost of upgrades to opentype friendly software. Some people simply don't
    want the hassle of applying said features. \r\n\r\nThe glyphs themselves have
    no opinion. "

    a single font, no one has the choice.

  body: Where there is never more than one alternate, another (if rather labour-intensive)
    way would be to make two fonts where one font's regular set is the other's alternate
    set.

  body: "@T\xE9 Rowan\r\nThat is an interesting solution. \r\n\r\n@bbg\r\nLimited
    choices limit your market. The question is are there enough older and CAD only
    systems to justify the inclusion of more choice.\r\n\r\nMy apologies for my grammar.
    I think I slipped a gear somewhere."
