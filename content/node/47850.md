body: "Hi there.\r\n\r\nI took a look at the install chapter on robofab's web page
  but didn't helped me that much. I've never used this kind of aplications and I don't
  have much experience using macros or scripts, so any easy aproach on how to install/use
  them would be greatlly apreciated.\r\n\r\nI'm running FL5 with Python v.2.4.4, on
  Windows Vista,\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nRegards"

    you install RoboFab? When do you get this error message?\r\n\r\n\r\n-Paul\r\n\r\nwww.type-invaders.com"

  body: "Hi, and thanks for reply\r\n\r\nAfter opening the zip folder containing robofab
    86, I have just tried to run the install.py file, and moved the folders to the
    macro folder in fontlab installation location.\r\nI've also installed Numpy 1.1.0
    for python 2.4 and TTX font tools.\r\n\r\nThis error message apears in the output
    window in FL.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: "Make sure you'll do the following:\r\n- Download the latest version from
    robofab.org (Robofab + FontTools + DialogKit)\r\n- After unzipping, place the
    RoboFab folder somewhere on your harddrive. I've put mine in my applications folder\r\n-
    Run install_zip.py\r\n- Copy *only* the folder named 'Scripts' to your FontLab
    macro folder\r\n\r\nIf you move the folder with the Robofab data to another location
    you need to run the install script again.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n-Paul\r\n\r\nwww.type-invaders.com"

    else find it useful:\r\n- I ended up with 2 version of Python installed: 2.4 and
    2.6\r\n- FontLab, for some reason, is using Python2.4\r\n- The latest version
    of Numpy1.5.1 uses Pyhton2.6, FontLab ignores it.\r\n- To install Numpy for Python2.4,
    I used and old Numpy1.2.1 release. "
