body: "So, i was thinking about maybe studying graphic design in England, and figuring
  out everything i need to know seems a herculean task at the moment...so i figured
  that the super-nice and knowledgeable people on Typophile might be able to help.
  :-)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, about me: i'm interested in most all areas of graphic design
  but currently typography is top of the heap, followed by illustration. Right now
  i'm working in the design department at a printer, which has been awesome for learning
  all the technical bits of the industry, but a bit lacking in creative nourishment.\r\n\r\nOk,\r\nQuestion
  1:\r\nWhich schools do you recommend? So far Reading and Central St. Martins seems
  most interesting, as both seem pretty \u201Cdesign-focused\u201D. Any others that
  take pride in their design programmes?\r\n\r\nQ2:\r\nWould it be a disadvantage
  to attend undergrad/postgrad at different schools? \r\n\r\nQ3:\r\nWhat are the application
  deadline for international, non-EU students (specifically norwegians)? I found some
  different answers to this around the web. \r\n\r\nI suppose that's good for a start...if
  there is anything else you think might help, lay it on me!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! "
