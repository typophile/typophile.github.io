body: Hey, I'm a new user to the site, looking for a little advice. I'm working on
  a website to take advantage of the amazing SIFR, setting all headings in  <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=434325&grab_id=0&page_id=27386&query=antenna&SCOPE=Fonts">Antenna
  Compressed Regular</a>. Any idea what would make a nice complement? Something to
  use for subheads and text. And out of the web fonts (Verdana, Tahoma, Georgia, Times)
  what would look best next to it?

    supposed to be embedding Font Bureau's fonts in this way. If you do have an extended
    license can I ask how much it cost?
