body: "what do we think of how the word 'craft' is rendered?\r\nis it brilliant or
  a little too much?\r\nthe entire word is almost a ligature, which made me wonder
  if there are any other good examples of words consisting of letters connected in
  such a way to form a ligature.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5937.jpg]"

  body: It would work better if the word the designer was setting was supposed to
    be "craf't" with an apostrophe.

  body: I really like how it flows. The negative and positive shapes work nicely together,
    and it's not often I see a whole ligatured word.
