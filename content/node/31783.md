  body: "@ Stephen\r\n\r\nWhy do you think Sassoon is \"a typeface for children\",
    and not e.g. Bembo for example?\r\n\r\n>6-12 \r\nis a very wide range because
    (this) 6 years show extreme differences in the development of children."

    it \"was designed to be used in children's books. It was designed for Linotype
    in 1988 by Adrian Williams and calligrapher Rosemary Sassoon.\" *\r\n\r\n* From
    Addison-Wesley's <em>The Postscript Font Handbook, Revised Edition</em>, 1992."

  body: "Everyone can claim that ;) \u2013 does it mean a soft and curvy (scriptlike)
    and \"simplistic\" sans is a better read for small children (which are beginners)?
    Or is a proofed antiqua like Bembo, the better way to go? \r\nThat was my question."

    collected Brooke Bond tea cards when I was a child (although I didn't drink tea...)\r\nThis

    in Monocle, BTW. "

  body: Nice Nick! And there's also a <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=M.9230.0.0">Schoolbook</a>
    version of Plantin which <a href="http://typographi.com/000490.php">Wallpaper</a>
    used quite affectively a few years ago.

    Weiss, Veljovic, NC Schoolbook, and Palatino. Usually in big sizes.\r\n\r\nTo
    be honest, he doesn't care about the typeface."
