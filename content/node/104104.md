  thinner vertical strokes. I especially love how the M is constructed, and I'm dying
  to find out what the font is so I can use it in a logo for a company that begins
  with M.\r\n\r\nThe signs have clearly been around for a while, possibly going back
  to the 1970s; to my untrained eye it looks like something from the heyday of Peignot
  and Helvetica.\r\n\r\nWhatTheFont recommended <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/ultimate-serial/\">Ultimate
  Serial Bold</a>, which is very similar but it's from 2010 and the M is not quite
  as good. I don't know if I will be able to get a good suggestion from WTF because
  every photo I take will be at a slight upward angle, since the signs hang from the
  ceiling.\r\n\r\nTherefore I'm asking here. I really appreciate the help!"

    \u2026 ?!?"
