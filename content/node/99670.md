body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a rough draft for an event poster, but
  have no idea what to do about font. This is for a fashion show and I'm hoping to
  make the font a bit more modern just so the poster doesn't read too dated or overly
  feminine yet I'm having a lot of trouble pinning something down so was hoping for
  some advice, ideas, brainstorming, etc. \r\n\r\nBasically, what I want is 3 lines
  of text and at least 2 different fonts so the text goes like this:\r\n\r\n[ORGANIZATION
  NAME] - much larger\r\n[EVENT NAME]\r\n[ LOCATION \u25CF DATE]\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/poster_5291.jpg]"
