    they used to!\r\n\r\nNick, I encourage you to include more mentions of physical
    arousal in your future promotional efforts."

    with the ladies back in the sixties! Batteries not needed... just whip out a broadside
    and hear them swoon.\r\n\r\nDid you know that Bradbury Thompson was well known
    by the Rat Pack? Joe Namath always referred to his little black specimen book
    for hot dates and Hugh Hefner considered adding new type fold-outs to Playboy
    ;^)"

  body: I don't think there was a version of this for companies that were thinking
    of placing an ad in <em>Playboy,</em> which at the time had a circulation of 6
    million. But it wouldn't have required much adapting. Slap. Flip. Flip. Slap.
    More pages wander by. Then it happens.
