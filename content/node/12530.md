  body: "Toronto Subway is *a version* of the indigenous TTC typeface. The TTC believes
    it has its own outline-font version. I have a few reservations about Toronto Subway;
    we may need a few more iterations before we arrive at a really accurate outline-font
    version, particularly given the fact that there is no model for the lower case.\r\n\r\n\u2014
