  body: Pieter,  <BR> <BR>I think you are exactly right that it is Myriad with a white
    added stroke around it. This sample was made with Myriad Bold with a 1.2pt white
    stroke added &#40;note how the k &amp; w are distorted, just like the sample&#41;
    for the top word, and Myriad Regular with a 2pt white stroke added for Publishing.

  body: What an ID! I had some thoughts about Myriad regarding this ID, but I wasn&#39;t
    bright enough to come up with the revolutionary &#34;stroke theory&#34; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
