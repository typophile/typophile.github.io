    \r\nLooking at number of glyphs is a good indication, if they are western fonts
    and have around 650+ chars they're likely WGL4 fonts, if they are Pro OT fonts
    then look for around 1000 chars to indicate possible WGL4 + alternates, ligs etc.,
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    optional characters. There are quite a lot of fonts with all the required characters,
    but not so many with the full complement including e.g. linedraw and boxdraw characters.
    If you want the latter, Helvetica Linotype is a good option (and you get the added
    benefit of Arabic and Hebrew).'

    seems difficult to find them.
