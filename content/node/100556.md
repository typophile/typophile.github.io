body: "Prumo is a new type system by DSType. With 92 fonts, Prumo is based on a unique
  skeleton that flows, like a pendulum, from high contrast to low contrast fonts,
  is a sort of typographic journey, from the eighteen century typefaces to the nineteen
  century slab serif typefaces, gathering information from the scotch roman fonts
  on it\u2019s journey. Prumo is a type family with classic proportions, that takes
  advantage of the recent type production technology while looking carefully at the
  most important historical references. Prumo Poster contains 4 styles that can be
  used as layers. Check it at www.dstype.com"
