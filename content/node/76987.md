  wich sells solar panels and other sustainable energy systems. \r\nThe logo must
  convey the message that we're talking about ENERGY. As you can see down, the logo
  has a hidden \"energy spine\".\r\nThe problem is that the company name is ECO, but
  in the logo with the switched \"C\" position to create the hidden spine you read
  \"EDO\".\r\n\r\nhttp://img508.imageshack.us/img508/9362/ecologo.png\r\n\r\nHow could
  I solve this legibility problem, make it more clear that it's a reversed \"C\" and
  not a \"D\"?  I tried them all and I'm quite stucked now on this one\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much,\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

    some clumsy letters just to keep the plug so obvious. The middle bar of E is too
    heavy & even if that C was the right way round it needs a closer relationship
    with the O.\r\n\r\nTry versions where the C itself is the body of the plug, rather
    than just the counter. You might then be able to do that with the C the right
    way round.\r\n\r\nAnother thought is have the C the right way round but with two
    slices through the left so C's counter is the plug and E is the socket. It might
    be going a bit too far with the imagery, but you could have something sun-like
    going on with O's counter, a little slice through its left side to be a cable
    going to C.\r\n"

    a plug, while very clever, has been already used in a number of really well-known
    logos. Have a look at the comments in <a href=\"http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/47306\">this
    thread</a> and you will see what I mean.\r\n"

    Busorama later if it appeals.\r\n\r\nOr maybe... a sparky E overprinted with a
    scripty CO?"

    now based on the suggestions you all gave me.\r\n\r\nSee you soon\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

    I'm not sure what to make of this."
