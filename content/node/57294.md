  in Fontlab? I've read the guide on: http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&cat_id=FontDesignTools
  \ and I'm also studying the Fontlab Manual, and I have seen some other sites on
  the matter, but I'm looking for something refreshing that will shed new light on
  the subject.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to find a tutorial or book that will guide you through
  the TrueType hinting process in a step-by-step manner that will keep me awake and
  off the coffee :P\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows of such a tutorial/book, or knows if there's
  one coming, please let me know :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nRudy"

  body: "Your welcome Typedog.\r\n\r\nI was realy hoping there would be people who
    knew of more tutorials/books about TrueType hinting in FontLab, but I guess there
    just aren't any more. I think most people don't have enough time to create one
    or just don't have the know-how.\r\n\r\nI've read in a book somewhere that there
    are only about 10 TrueType hinting professionals in the world and that some others
    come close, but are no professionals.\r\nIf this is true, I think more education
    on TrueType hinting must come to enlarge the number of professionals. They in
    their turn can teach others, so there will finaly be more tutorials and books
    about the subject.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

  body: I started to try to teach myself about it and I got some good results but
    I never felt that I had a comprehensive understanding. The other thing is you
    can semi-OK hinting with automated methods. And the rendering environments that
    TT hinting is made for may or may not be ones your project needs to worry about.
    So before you invest the time I would look carefully at why you need to know about
    this. Once you have a clear context it maybe a great idea to learn about but it
    may just as easily be a waste of time. And finally my understanding is that Pros
    use special in house tools you cannot buy. I would be interested in any info that
    contradicts this last point.

  body: 'If you are just getting started then my suggestion ( I am paraphrasing what
    I have been told this by many designers I respect) is that you not worry about
    TT hinting for a good long while and concentrate on other aspects of type design
    that are going to stay relevant in a way that a narrow technical aspect which
    is really just for screen may not. You may also want to look at PS hints and blue
    zones because they are much simpler.   '

  body: "I learned some basic TT hinting from the FontLab manual, just enough to tweak
    some characters. \r\nIt still bugs me though that I don't have a comprehensive
    understanding of TT hinting. I'm silently hoping an in-house tool of the \"Pros\"
    will go public or that an easier TT hinting method will come in the next upgrade
    of FontLab.\r\n\r\nI realise now that Type 1 hinting (and maybe a conversion from
    Type 1 to TT) looks good enough for most fonts.\r\n\r\nP.S. thanks for your help
    Eben, I was writing this comment when you post yours, so I couldn't comment on
    that.\r\n\r\nRudy"

  body: "Thanks gferreira. But I must say that Visual TrueType looks as complex as
    normal TT hinting in FontLab. And after reading this:\r\n\r\nIs Visual TrueType
    an appropriate tool for you? \r\n\r\nAlthough the graphical user-interface of
    VTT dramatically simplifies the task of font hinting, the tool is not for the
    novice. The learning curve is fairly steep, simply because hinting requires professional
    skills regardless of the tools. Even accomplished type designers who have been
    using Fontographer and FontLab for years to design fonts have evaluated VTT and
    decided that professional hinting is not for them. In a way, this is similar to
    desktop publishing programs, as they make it easier for the professional typesetter
    to cut-and-paste, but they don't make the rest of us professional typographers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    don't think this is the solution to make TT hinting easier. But thanks anyways,
    it's better than nothing ;)\r\n\r\nRudy"

    hinting. Avoid TrueType and stick to OpenType CFF or Type 1 with its vastly simpler
    hinting model.\r\n\r\nBack in the day, I did manual TT hinting with VTT, and it
    was a whole bunch o' work. Interesting, and sorta fun for me, but lots to learn.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    Type 1 to TT when generating the font?\r\n\r\nRudy"

  body: "\r\nRudy, \r\n\r\nFor the Type 1 hinting model the essential steps to do
    is: \r\n\r\n1. Font Info / Hinting Settings / Auto Zones. \r\n2. Tools / Action
    / Hints and Guidelines / Autohint (with Apply to entire font enabled). \r\n3.
    Font Info / Hinting Settings / Standard stems / Auto stems. \r\n\r\nOnce this
    is done, you can let FontLab Studio do the conversion when generating the TT font,
    or you can take the separate step to convert your outlines to TrueType outlines
    and then convert hints to TT instructions using Tools / Action Set. This will
    have exactly the same result. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you do the conversion in a separate
    step, you'll be able to open the TrueType Hinting tool before generating the font
    and review the hinting results glyph by glyph. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

  body: "Thanks Adam,\r\n\r\nI did a separate conversion from Type 1 to TT before
    generating a TT font. I noticed that the stem widths are very important if you
    don't want to spend to much time adjusting the TT hints afterwards.\r\n\r\nI'm
    now manually (TT)hinting every character, I still don't know exactly what I'm
    doing but I'm getting a better result than when I only do a T1 to TT conversion.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Adam, I've read your comments on choosing encodings and generating fonts in Learn
    Fontlab Fast (from Leslie Cabarga). A good book for learning Type 1 hinting, it's
    easy reading. Sadly there is almost nothing about TT hinting in it.\r\n\r\nRudy"

  body: Creating satisfactory TrueType hints requires a lot of manual fine tuning
    and the willingness to use some mathematics to reach that *perfect* delta hint
    value. If you don't wish to fall down that rabbit hole, I suggest going with Adam
    & Thomas's above advice and just staying with Type 1 hints
