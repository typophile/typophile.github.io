  body: "Good Jan! The general characteristics match Gotham, but you are right when
    I look at the details more closely. The G horizontal is shorter than Gotham and
    the arms of the T and E are shorter than Gotham too. There is even a slight angle
    to the terminals of the T and E, which I didn't realize at first.\r\n\r\nI didn't
    know Drescher Grotesk before, either.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
