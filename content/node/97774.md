  body: "If she wants a bit of tension making the backslant mismatch its adjacent
    diagonals is actually a good idea - it just needs to be a bit more obvious so
    it doesn't look like just a mistake. But if she wants a \"calmer\" logo (which
    is what that light Myriad is shooting for, at least to me) then making the backslant
    match the adjacent diagonals is better (probably clearly extending above and below
    though*, lest it blend in <em>too</em> much - making the logo too bland, and harder
    to read).\r\n\r\n* Note that as it stands it's doing the latter more than the
    former (and not enough in either case).\r\n\r\nBTW, I took a closer look and -no
    surprise- the \"facing\" diagonals of the \"A\" and \"W\" are not exactly parallel
    either (although they're very close). So if she does go for calm it might be worth
    tweaking those - but be careful, a lot can go wrong when messing with a font,
    especially a high-quality one!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
