    Roy Preston was at one time working on a huge family &#40;his <i>magnum opus,</i>
    you might say&#41; called Preference, which has fraction fonts, in several weights,
    that compose wonderful, complex nut fractions. I don&#39;t know if he ever completed
    the whole family. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: What&#39;s a nut fraction? Is that when the superior figure is directly above
    the inferior, and the &#34;virgule&#34; is horizontal?

  body: 'Yes, Nick, that&#39;s it. So called because it is typically an en width.
    1&#41; There are two practical drawbacks to nut fractions: the numerator and denominator
    are typically smaller than in regular fractions, often too small for use at the
    littler sizes. For example, here is a comparison from Palatino Linotype: <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/25200.gif" alt="Fraction comparison">
    <BR>2. There is easy way to make arbitrary fractions, because the bar has to stretch
    over the denominators. To do this sort of thing you need a mathematical layout
    tool, whereas regular fractions of any size can be fairly easily made, with the
    right components, in any page layout or word processing application. Nut fractions
    are only good for a limited number of &#39;standard&#39; fractions.'

  body: 'Hmm. I learned it the other way around: that &#34;em&#34; and &#34;en&#34;
    came first. But in a noisy print shop, especially if there were Linotypes or Monotypes
    clattering away, these two sounded too similar and nicknames like &#34;mutton&#34;
    and &#34;nut&#34; were used to make them more distinct. &#40;Sort of like the

  body: Hi <BR> <BR>Thanks to everyone that provided an answer here and off-list.
    The availability of a number of typefaces with this style of fraction will help
    us argue for their support in the XAML mark-up language.  <BR> <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/core/overviews/about%20xaml.aspx"

  body: "If any style of fraction is to be called \"Vulgar,\" it'd be those ones I
    see in mss all the time, with all 3 elements on the baseline. As in: 1/2 or 17/32.
    Now that's Vulgar.\r\n\r\nI think the \"standard fraction\" Tiffany asked about
    has generally in typography/typesetting been called a \"case fraction,\" for once
    upon a time they were common enough that they could be found in a many typecases
    for use by hand comps.\r\n\r\nPiece fractions had several manifestations in metal
    type, both machine-set and hand-set. Take a look at these pages to see what a
    Linotypist had to do to compose some piece fractions.\r\n\r\nLinotype horizontal-stroke
    piece fracs:\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=XxcPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=%22piece+fractions%22&source=bl&ots=I6q75-c90O&sig=Jq682MH1a-YAH70PrqX88ctVQRQ&hl=en&ei=vkcLStwlkoKZB8ecmQw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPA171,M1\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=eTJ8khmZie0C&pg=PA617&lpg=PA617&dq=%22piece+fractions%22&source=bl&ots=g5Fh_ZQrx0&sig=hrlpDJIJ6lIl_nUwwkyL5CmU5YI&hl=en&ei=vkcLStwlkoKZB8ecmQw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#PPA617,M1\r\n\r\nI
    seem to recall that in hand-set type there were numerator sorts that carried the
    number plus half the virgule and denominator sorts that carried the number plus
    the other virgule half. Then there were fraction superior sorts for 2-digit numerators
    or denominators. These had none of the virgule, and were placed left or right
    of the other digit as needed. It was complex work back then.\r\n\r\npowers"
