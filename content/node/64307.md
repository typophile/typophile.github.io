body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI'm looking to redo the following logo and I was wondering
  if anyone can confirm the font used in the word 'superstars'? \r\n\r\nIt appears
  to be Franklin Gothic Heavy Italic , if you look beyond the extruded text and star
  cutout. I'm just not sure though. I tried matching it up , but I'm coming in a little
  short.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the bottom though , 'of wrestling' is the Compacta
  font. \r\n\r\nCan anyone confirm either of these?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/superstars_6142.jpg]"

    Heavy Italic]]. This comes from QBF which was known for renamed versions of familiar
    fonts in a wider range of weights than the originals. FontBank also had many of
    the heaviest weights in their Expresiv Classic collection, where this was called
    Tempest Heavy Italic.\r\n\r\nI think you're right about Compacta for the lower
    line.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
