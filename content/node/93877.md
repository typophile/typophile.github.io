  body: Some good thinks in this. At first glance I find the /f,t,y/ terminal too
    short. The spin of the /Ss/ is too squeeze in the middle, the horizontal of the
    /2,7/ is too thick and probably the stem of the /1,4/ too also too thick. the
    /m,n/ should be copy from the /h/ where the stem meet the curve. I prefer the
    shoulder of the /h/ compare to the the /m,n/. /bdgpq/ seems too wide compare to
    the /o,e,c/. Finally, compare the terminal of the /c,e/ it should be in the same
    way. Keep going.

  body: It's really amazing how you can look at something for so long and then someone
    points out an obvious flaw that's been there all along and you think "how could
    I have missed that?" Thanks again, Sim for the feedback - some of the items you
    pointed out really made me redo quite a few letters and I like it better. Would
    love any other comments big or small - very helpful. Here's the updated font.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/holt-specimen2_5309.jpg]

  body: "You still have some wildly inconsistent stroke widths. For instance, the
    thick parts of the round strokes as in |o| are much lighter than the thick parts
    of straight strokes as in |l|. Also compare the diagonals in your |V W X Y| \u2014
    they all look different.\r\n\r\nCheck this out: http://66.147.242.192/~operinan/2/2.3.2a/2.3.2.05.verticals.htm"
