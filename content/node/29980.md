  sans serif or script - either in to differrent cuts (alternative styles)  or as
  an Opentype font with alternates. Handwritten type often gets \"stereotype\" so
  i need to make it more alive.\r\n\r\nI hope anyone can help.\r\n\r\nBenjamin"

    has been given the OpenType treatment! Now, contextual alternates (which work
    automatically in the latest versions of Adobe software) make typesetting with
    Handsome look even more like real writing. Not only that, but the range of \u201Cpens\u201D
    has been extended to six styles, with Thin (much like a \u201CFineliner\u201D)
    and Extra Bold (rather like \u201CSpeedball Fat\u201D) versions at either end
    of the weight spectrum, Classic (a super-elegant version of Nib) and Rough, which
    simulates the effect of a rollerball or fine-tipped felt-nib pen on ordinary paper,
    with a subtle \u201Cbleed\u201D."

  body: our very own [[Randy Jones]] is very good at doing hand-lettered fonts that
    straddle the line between formal & informal. I know he has some projects he's
    developing, you might contact him and see if he has anything that you would fine
    useful. Or, check out [[Christian Robertson]]'s [[Dear Sarah]].
