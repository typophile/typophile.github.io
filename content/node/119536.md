  time. While I have had graphic design training, most of my typography and design
  know-how is self-taught and this site has often times served as a valuable resource.
  With that said, I'd appreciate feedback on this logo for a metal/rock band that
  I've been working on. I have included sketches and snapshots of the design process:\r\n\r\n[[http://i.imgur.com/ZnQyU7f.jpg]]\r\n"
