  It's my third typeface design and the first more \"serious\" one. Since I have no
  formal type design education, it's always a great deal of work to figure things
  out. Hope you enjoy it. Hope you buy it. Hope. :)\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/estudiocrop/riff/\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time. Feedback's apreciated.\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nDado\r\nwww.dadoqueiroz.com\r\nwww.flickr.com/dadoqueiroz[img:sites/default/files/old-images/riff-flickr_4190.png]"

  body: "Congratulations!\r\n\r\nI liked the typeface, It has a great feel to it.
    \r\nThough the lowercase \"t\" doesn't work for me - It looks more of like a distorted
    \"i\" or \"1\"."
