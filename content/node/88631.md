body: 'Given that the tracker, at the moment, shows about 60 updated blogs--all SPAM,
  perhaps it''s time to consider moving the blog updates out of the main tracker log?
  I have no idea if that''s an easy task to accomplish, so perhaps it''s not a realistic
  suggestion, but if it is, it may make for reading updates a lot easier/nicer for
  those that use the tracker. '

  body: "Short answer: no.\r\nLonger one: yes, spam is bad and sometimes it seems
    worse, ruining the peaceful perusal of the forum.\r\nBut when spammers attack,
    they comment on forum topics as well as blog entries.\r\nAnd, most important,
    the tracker is a tracker, it need to show everything.\r\nThe fact that some users
    (myself included) use it as the primary starting point to access the site means
    either that they choose to \u201Cdrink directly from the faucet\u201D or that
    other means of access have proven less satisfactory (namely the home page and
    http://typophile.com/forums) (again, in my case, both are true). Other users have
    asked something like \u201Cgive me all but the Type ID Board\u201D.\r\n\u201CCensoring\u201C
    the tracker will not solve the spam problem, nor the access point one."

  body: "You may be right about equal amounts of Spam hitting both discussions and
    blogs, but, at least for blogs, they seem to be 80% spam posts these days, so
    it clutters the tracker quite a bit.\r\n\r\nI agree, though. It won't solve the
    SPAM problem, that's a whole other issue. \r\n\r\n"
