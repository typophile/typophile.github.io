  body: I just fired up ID CS3, opened a file and selected Mangal as the body copy.
    It displayed just fine, and the Hindi characters showed up in the Glyph palette...

    add-on like ScribeDoor\r\n\r\nhttp://www.winsoft-international.com/en/products/scribedoor-for-creative-suite.html\r\n\r\nOtherwise
    the required vowel reorderings and complex consonant ligatures (conjuncts) will
    not be produced."

    plug-in (Windows only):\r\n[[http://metadesignsolutions.com/indicPlus]]\r\n\r\nFor
    CS4 or CS5 there are several other options, including ScribeDoor and World Tools."

  body: "Nick \u2014 To truly display Indic scripts properly, the text engine needs
    to be able to process several Indic-specific OpenType features for vowel positioning
    and compound consonant conjuncts (as Tom mentions). So, even though the typefaces
    show up and the characters are all there in the glyph palette, that\u2019s not
    quite the same as being able to use them, practically speaking."

title: Is it possible to use Open Type Mangal ( Hindi ) and Shruti ( Gujarati ) fonts
  with Indesign CS3?
