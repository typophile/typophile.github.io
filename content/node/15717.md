  or Interstate. Open, reliable, convincing but friendly, for both body text and Headlines.
  Din M. is OK but a bit worn-out. Any Ideas?"

  body: I wouldn't say frustrating. Just different from MyFonts, with which many are
    more familiar. Village's site lets you get to many showings more quickly, and
    the sampler is interactive - see the results as you type.

    No PC/Windows. I'm not sure what I had open that time, but I couldn't see the
    fonts which is why I put that other link on there. No biggie.\r\n\r\nOn another
    note, do you think we'll ever get back to the days when the jpeg appeared directly
    in the thread, not requiring a link? That was so nice.... and I still think the
    font is too big in the original post. Looks like it's for the visually impaired
    which we will all be if we keep staring at fonts online."

    but in a less ubiquitous font. As this list shows there is no shortage of Din-alikes
    to choose from.
