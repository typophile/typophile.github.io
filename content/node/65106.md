  design/visual information of one of the Polish pilgrimage centres. I'd like to ask
  you a favour: I'd appreciate any pictures and/or links related to communication
  design/visual information of monuments, especially the religious ones, around the
  world. \r\n\r\nThx in advance!"

    \u2013 can you define a bit more precisely what you are looking for? Things like
    guides/maps to monuments/centers? Websites? Signage at sites of interest?"

  body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nSorry for not responding for some time.\r\n\r\n<strong>riccard0</strong>\r\nI
    use google and I found a lot of wayfinding systems. But the problem is with finding
    communication design in pilgrim centers.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for maps/plans, signs,
    pictograms etc. in pilgrim centers like Vatican, F\xE1tima and more (not necessarily
    Christian). I'm not interested in the whole city of Rome or Vatican wayfinding
    system, but only in the pilgrim destination itself.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has pictures
    that might be of use in my project and wouldn't mind my using them, I'd be grateful.
    \r\n"
