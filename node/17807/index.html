  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">sometimes, when i'm logged on to this forum, i wonder what all of you are doing out there as you are typophiling. right now, we're all logged in and yet, we are in different parts of the world, at different times of the day, doing different things. 

i'll go ahead and assume that most of us are near a computer, but where? you could be sitting at a coffee shop with a laptop, or in the comfort of your own home. some of you might be the principle of your studio in the corner suite, others may be huddled in a cubicle, sneaking a peak at your recent posts.

is your spouse getting a little jelous or are you almost late for work?

the sun went down 30 minutes ago. my boss and co-workers are gone. it's nice and quiet in the studio. i'm staying a little late, trying to get this project done, realizing that i've just spent way too much time crafting this post. what about you?

Before that I was on the couch in our living room working on my laptop, listening to some <a href="http://www.lamb.tv/home.html">Lamb</a> and tinkering away at a suite of 3 co-ordinated logos till 2 am while my wife and kids were sound asleep upstairs.

Even before that I did a sweep of the Type ID Board and cleaned a whole bunch of threads. After I e-mailed the logos to the client I couldn't resist checking in on <a href="http://pvponline.com/">PVP</a>.

Right now I'd better get busy giving the kids their breakfast. :^) Laters.</div>

1) business parter to turn up, 
2) Client to reply to my email telling them that we will not work for the shitty rates they propose beacause "this project presents an exciting opportunity to develop and expose your book work." BEWARE of these statements. 
3) Inspiration
4) Motivation to finish a billion typefaces
While I listen to My Bloody Valentine, following a good, loud play of Nirvana "Silver" out-takes and contemplating that last episode of Six Feet Under that aired here last night.

Soon, I will call my daughter in Pittsburgh, she is a senior at Carnegie Mellon University.

		<div class="commentbody">It's 5pm now, here in Central Europe. I'm at home drinking coffee. Saturdays give me time to work on what I want to work on… today I'm working on two display typefaces, one bigger one for Linotype, and a smaller one that isn't.

I usually have Typophile on at work, but try to keep my reading and posting time there to a minimum. I'll post links to Linotype faces, or answer questions. Otherwise, I should stay away from it :-D

At work, I always have Vienna on in the background to keep tabs on every other type site  (especially Jürgen Siebert's <a href="http://www.fontblog.de">Fontblog</a>) via their RSS-feeds, but that only shows me new the new Typophile threads, not the new posts :(

My girlfriend began working on her graduate thesis on Monday, so my weekends are now all working weekends, too. Hopefully, this'll be productive, and I'll be able to bring some things to market by the summer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My wife and daughter are taking a nap at the moment, so things are unusually quiet. It's two pm here in Seattle. I'm sitting at the dining room table with my laptop, sitting in an Aeron chair, and occasionally glancing out one of the windows to admire the trees. We're just outside Seattle proper, so there are tons of tall trees. The room has a lot of eight-foot windows, and some skylights. I'm sipping ice water from a huge acrylic tumbler that could hold one of those convenience store drinks. Next to me are: what's left of the pile of mail I just sorted through, a biography of the Beatles, and some just-arrived items: the book "Real World InDesign CS2," and CDs by Biff Rose and Ry Cooder. Maybe I'll put one on to listen to.

We just got back into town late last night, and this morning I read an email that said a friend needed help moving. I called him up, but he now has plenty of help and suggested that I take it easy. So I am catching up on remaining email, and in a minute I will take a break from that and continue working - either on a typeface or on a DTP revival of an antique out-of-print board game.

Cheers,
