body: "I need some alternatives to paair with this mark.\r\nIt needs to be itallic
  to go along with the italic nature of the mark.\r\nWe would tweak the axis of the
  mark to match the axis of the type.\r\nIt needs to have a similar feel to this.
  A similar weight and color.\r\nI have used the bold italic small caps from Klavika
  here.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? ;)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: It looks mathematically correct now - I think the bottom stroke of the C and
    the area occupied by the type is slightly too big.

  body: The C of the monogram. I would also slice a little bit the sharp part of the
    N.

  body: Are you saying to carry the negative space on the N further inward?
