  film \"stars\" a computer operating system of the future.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for
  a font that we can use for subtitles etc,  that gives the right feel - futuristic
  and computery, and that is also easy to read as there will be quite a lot of text.
  \r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend a font please?\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from
  you.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nNeil\r\n"

  body: "The problem with fonts that look futuristic and computery is they almost
    instantly look dated as well. Consider other fashion trends in your film: what
    are the characters wearing? what is the architecture like? You will likely see
    those trends reflected in the industrial and graphic designs too, and the computers
    and the OS running on them especially. Look into the speculative sci-fi of the
    past, consider what predictions they got wrong, since the present was the future
    in the past.\r\n\r\nGraphic trends often have a cycle of rebellion and conservative
    backlash, followed by innovation, then getting really weird, followed by rebellion
    in the form of conservative backlash. Or something like that. Perhaps in your
    speculative era extraneous ornamet will come back into fashion, and we'll see
    some double-serifed blackletter hybrid on the computer screens. Of course it would
    still have to be legible on the viewing technology of today, seeing as that is
    what you and your audience have available."

  body: Perhaps the most futuristic thing to do is use something that wasn't <em>designed</em>.
    Some completely simple programmer font, like Verdana or Monaco, would be the most
    futuristic thing you could do. Maybe I'm thinking too much. :^)

    is set? I'd say humanist sans are going to be the norm for the next 15 years,
    so if that meets your criteria stick with one of them - Myriad would be a safe
    bet.  \r\n\r\n  "

    the actual standard for the next hundred years, but it should look right for today's
    audience, which is what you need. Clean and sophisticated geometry, not the...
    traditional concept of a futuristic look, based on brutish screen fonts of yesteryear
    (I believe this paradox is also what Cuttlefish had in mind)."

    of a sufficient resolution that make the need for 'computery' typefaces obsolete.\r\n\r\nI
    like the Kontrapunkt typeface mentioned. You could go with the angle that in the
    future, world culture will be increasingly influenced by the far east Japanese
    and Chinese cultures and, as such, pick up some of that style."

    any doubt: their homepage mentions Tokyo, but the font is Danish, and its cool
    and clean lines are quite in keeping with design traditions from that part of
    the world: just think of 1960s Danish furniture.'
