body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI need to design a cover for a corporate publication following
  their brand guidelines which required the design to use Garamond 3. Unfortunately,
  I don\u2019t have Garamond 3 (this is actually the first time I heard about Garamond
  3). I do have ITC Garamond, Adobe Garamond and Stempel Garamond. So I am thinking
  to replace Garamond 3 with the other Garamond which I already have. Although, I
  have realized their slight differences. Do you have any suggestion which Garamond
  fit best to replace Garamond 3? Or is it too obvious if I replaced them? (I am hoping
  my client won\u2019t notice it, since it will only appear on the cover)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance.\r\n\r\n"

    is set in Frutiger. I don''t actually working on the internal publications, they
    actually organize this with somebody else. '

  body: "Garamond No. 3 is one of the <em>Jannon</em> \"Garamonds,\" based on type
    cut by the Huguenot printer Jean Jannon, who was thrown in the slammer for printing
    Protestant tracts. His type was impounded, too. When they released the fonts after
    a number of years, some French flatfoot said \"It's Garamond.\" He was wrong.\r\n\r\nThe
    other fonts you mention are not \"Jannon Garamonds.\" Monotype Garamond is also
    based on Jannon's fonts, and in many ways, is a better one."

  body: 'Buy Garamond 3 (you might only need the roman) and bill the client. They
    can''t expect you to have every Garamond on the planet. Or print out the text
    in the Garamonds you have and compare it with the same text set in Garamond 3
    at MyFonts or other retailer''s type-tester. One of them may be close enough.
    Depends partly on what letters are in the text. But I can echo Paul: don''t use
    ITC Garamond.'

  body: "Use Adobe Garamond. The client will probably not notice. Stempel Garamond
    is too quirky and ITC is too fugly.\r\n\r\nHowever, if it's corporate they should
    pony up for a Garamond 3 license if they require you to use it."

  body: "Pattyfab and Gary Long \u2014 I totally agree, I might just need to ask my
    client to buy the Garamond 3. I only need one weight and it doesn't cost that
    much. It safest that way.\r\n\r\nCharles_e \u2014 Thanks for the information,
    I wouldn't have known. (I agree too, Monotype Garamond has the most sophisticated
    look than the other Garamond.)\r\n\r\nThank you guys for the help. This experience
    has given me a better understanding of the different types of Garamond. "
