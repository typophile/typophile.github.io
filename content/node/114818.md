  appear next to a font name in design software such as Illustrator. What does the
  diamond, exclamation, quotation and hash tag marks marks represent? \r\nI grabbed
  the attached image from the innerwebs and is apparently a screen grab of  Illy on
  a Mac. I only use MS products and I can't seem to replicate these marks at all on
  any my machines."
