  the flock letters found on this old cycling jersey? Thanks in advance.

  body: I too considered Fountain's Mayo. <a href="http://www.emigre.com/FontText/PBasF.gif"
    title="Sample of Base Nine from Emigre">Base Nine</a> from Emigre features similar
    characteristics&mdash;most notably in the uppercase set. While the cycling jersey
    pictured predates any of the type choices mentioned here, Houschka Black would
    certainly seem to be a competant substitution. Unless of course I decide to create
    something custom&hellip;Thanks for your suggestions!
