  her stunning bas relief work and as a result designs her share of coins, medals
  and plaques involving type as well as portraits in which the subject's name is a
  critical typographic element. She's asked me to collaborate with her on a project.
  \r\n\r\nThe client requested Caslon as close to the 18th Century version as possible.
  The debates here and elsewhere about the \"real\" Caslon \r\n\r\nThere's a great
  conversation here: http://typophile.com/node/30941  but I can't seem to find a straight
  answer. Does anyone have a new take on this age old question? \r\n\r\nMy second
  question is about typography and coin design, of which I've found scant little in
  googling \"coin design numismatic typography\" and similar phrases.  Surely a typophile
  out there has done a study on the subject. A straight search came up with little,
  but an image search http://bit.ly/eyBQHc scored some beautiful results.\r\n\r\nAny
  typophiles have a special interest in the topic?  Thanks in advance.  And check
  out Amy's work. It's great stuff. \r\n\r\nPatrick\r\n\r\nTypographyShop\r\n"

  body: "On Caslon, the reason you didn't find a \"straight answer\" is because there
    isn't one universal answer. If you print sloppily inked letterpress on soft, damp
    paper using foundry type that closely approximates Caslon's, you will get a result
    that looks like typical eighteenth-century printing. If you use a different technology,
    you have to make choices about which qualities you will emulate. Founder's Caslon
    is the closest digital design to the outlines of Caslon's own foundry type, but
    it's \"cleaner\" than the normal eighteenth-century ink spread or the texture
    of the paper, both of which Caslon may have allowed for in designing his type.
    Is that \"real\" or not? That depends on you.\r\n\r\nAs for coin design, I don't
    know what your question is. The letter and number punches formerly used in making
    coin dies were certainly similar in nature to the punches used in making type
    matrices - I expect it would be interesting to know whether they were ever made
    by the same people. Medals are different, after the invention of the Janvier lathe
    - the lettering is often modeled rather than cut."
