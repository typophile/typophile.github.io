  body: Adelle, after you post here you get an error message about half the time.
    Don&#39;t repost, believe me it went through. What I do to check is go to topics
    and I see my name as the most recent post and I know it went through. <BR>As for
    Schweppes, isn&#39;t it an old brand? It might have been hand drawn. See if you
    can find any information about when the logo was created.
