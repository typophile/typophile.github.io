body: "FontShop.com recently introduced our <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/gallery/\">Gallery</a>
  page, showcasing additional specimens and examples of type in use found on the Web.
  When an image is added, it appears on both the <a href=\u201Chttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/gallery/\">Latest
  Gallery</a> page as well as on any font or package page from the type family in
  use. Congrats to Klavika, the current frontrunner with <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/process_type_foundry/klavika_basic_ot/?t=g\">18
  gallery images</a> added so far! \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve now made it easy for anyone
  to submit type samples, with our public <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/blog/?p=1585\">FontShop
  Gallery Bookmarklet</a>. You can find and install the bookmarklet at the bottom
  of any FontShop.com product page, as well at the top of the Latest Gallery page
  linked above \u2014 just click \"Submit images to the Gallery\" and go from there.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re
  hoping that this is a mutually beneficial feature, for designers and for FontShop.
  Type designers can submit specimens of their own, which link back to their site;
  graphic designers can submit work from their portfolios; and FontShop will have
  a richer diversity of specimens to show off. \r\n\r\nGive it a try and let us know
  what you think!\r\n\r\n-Ivan B"

    you should be taking advantage of <a href=\"http://typedia.com/blog/post/machine-tags-for-type/\"
    title=\"As inaugurated by Typedia\">the recent <code>type:face=<cite>NAME</cite></code>
    machine-tag microformat</a>. (There\u2019s also <code>classification</code>, <code>style</code>,
    and a few other descriptors.) Ideally you would release an API that allows gallery
    photographs to be aggregated elsewhere, exactly as Flickr does. You can already
    use the Flickr API to haul in photos thus tagged \u2013 several thousand from
    my stream alone."

  body: I'm a big fan of that Flickr machine tag, but FontShop's goal for this gallery
    is not quantity but quality, a hand-picked selection of the most interesting design.
    We're selecting things one at a time for now, either on our own or via submissions.
    That said, we'll definitely look at ways to let users submit in bulk via their
    Flickr collection in the future.

    and write an API (involved)."
