body: "I would like to ask some questions about bell gothic. This is a very good sans-serif
  font to me, but I am quite stuck by the problem of the capital letter \"I\", cause
  it is strangely a serif while the whole set is sans serif. Does anyone know why
  is this? Is there any modified font which only correct the sans serif I into serif
  so the whole set of font could be more applicable and consistent? \r\n\r\nLook at
  this album:\r\nhttp://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B0009OU2M8.02.LZZZZZZZ.jpg\r\nDo
  you think HARD-Fi's \"i\" being changed to small case because of the serif of capital
  letter \"I\"? :)\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know the font in this cover?\r\nhttp://996andme.dproj.or.jp/image/leanings/joy.jpg\r\nThe
  right side 'joy' is bell gothic black?\r\nand how about the left font? I can figure
  out the \"K\" is not bell gothic family...\r\n\r\nthx a lot..."

  body: "First, the HARD-Fi album is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_din_ot_bold/&sample_text=HARD-Fi%20FI&sample_size=60\">FF
    DIN</a>, not Bell Gothic. \r\n\r\nOn <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/bell_gothic_virtual/&sample_text=HARD%20Fi%20FI&sample_size=74\">Bell's
    cap 'I'</a>, it certainly is an awkward thing. But sometimes a little quirk is
    appropriate depending on the use.\r\n\r\n"

    Engschrift</a>, but not quite. Maybe another DIN.'

  body: I take that back. "joy" looks closest to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_din_ot_condensed_bold/&sample_text=joy&sample_size=144">FF
    DIN Condensed</a>.

  body: YUKI is likely <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_din_ot_bold/&sample_text=YUKI&sample_size=144">FF
    DIN Bold</a> with the left side (bottom of letters) distorted in the scan.

  body: "OH, thanks for your great help. Now i just found the font I've seen and loved
    for long is FF Din!\r\nIn fact, I still think there should be some modified font
    of Bell gothic specifically changed the I into sans. Please look at this, I closely
    inspected each letter and only found only the I is different from Bell gothic
    black...\r\n"

    I do think it is FF DIN not Fette Engschrift, concerning the 'O'. It is curved
    on both side horizontally. Well done."
