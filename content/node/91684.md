  Gothic]] , the new type family by Veronika Burian and Jos\xE9 Scaglione. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TG_release2_3422.png]\r\n\r\nGraphic
  designers of any nationality and background know very well that the art of composing
  titles correctly is not easy, Especially when it comes to periodical publications
  where there is need for both flexibility and graphic coherence. [[http://www.type-together.com/Tablet%20Gothic|Tablet
  Gothic]] was originally engineered as a titling type family, meant to help designers
  working on publications that require output as hard copies and a variety of digital
  platforms at the same time. As such, it is a grotesque sans serif that looks to
  the future of publishing with a clear understanding of its history, and reminiscences
  that go back to nineteenth century Britain and Germany.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[[http://www.type-together.com/Tablet%20Gothic|Tablet
  Gothic]] delivers the sturdy, straightforward and clean appearance expected from
  a grotesque, but it allows itself a good measure of personality to make it stand
  out on the page. Its 42 styles \u2013six series of condensation and seven weights
  in each series\u2013 guarantee that, whatever the publication format is, there's
  a [[http://www.type-together.com/Tablet%20Gothic|Tablet Gothic]] font that will
  do the job and perform well both technically and aesthetically. Furthermore, the
  rounder styles, Tablet Gothic Wide, Normal and Narrow achieved amazing results at
  very small sizes, producing  a beautiful texture and highly readable text blocks.\r\nKerning
  by Radek Sidun.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tablet Gothic fonts can be purchased individually,
  by series or as a complete bundle (best value: just \u20AC12 per font!).</strong>\r\n\r\nmore
