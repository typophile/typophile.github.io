  body: "This topic is somewhat moldy Chris (as Googling \"Cheese or Font Typophile\"
    would reveal).\r\nAnd the game is inaccurate.\r\nI let him know a year ago that
    Beaufort is not only a cheese but also a font (as Googling \"Beaufort Font\" would
    reveal), but he hasn't bothered fixing the error."
