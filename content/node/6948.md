  body: The top &#40;and bottom one--looks like you backslanted it to make it upright&#41;
    is almost certainly <b>not</b> a font, but a custom design just for the logo.  <BR>
    <BR>The middle one may have started out as a font, but has been heavily redrawn
    for the distorted effect. In this case, it&#39;s not done very well, so I would
    guess that this is not the original, but someone&#39;s attempt to redo it in Illustrator
    or something.  <BR> <BR>By the way, there are no fonts that do that distortion
    thing on their own. There are filters for Illustrator and other programs that
    can do that effect, but to get it to look right, you have to do a lot of tweaking.

  body: Yeah, I was hoping you wouldn&#39;t say that, thank you anyway. I did skew
    the bottom lettering, just to see what a font would look like without beind italicized.
    The top and middle I got from Brandsoftheworld.com as decals. I need to put a
    border around it, but that will take some work.
