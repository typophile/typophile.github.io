  body: "In general: no. Think of it as a standard commercial font which just happens
    to have a price of $0,00. \r\nIt has a typical license agreement (EULA) of a commercial
    font, which would not allow distribution/resale. \r\n\r\nBut you can simply ask
    the designer if he is willing to allow the use you are interested in. "
