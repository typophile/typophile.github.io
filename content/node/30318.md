  on www.kfc.com (the \"Kentucky Fried\" and \"Chicken\" typefaces). I'm thinking
  they may be custom fonts, but if they look familiar to any of you, please let me
  know. Thank you! :)\r\n\r\n~megan"

    a little. I think I found a spoof font of their \"Kentucky Fried\" logo as well,
    that's about as close as I can get.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help all! :)"
