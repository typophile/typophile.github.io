  the support and knowledge given, although this is my first post I've been consulting
  the site on a regular basis and has been always a great help.\r\n\r\nI was trying
  to create a typeface of my own based on early geometric fonts like Kabel or Futura
  with a contemporary look to work as a display typeface with alternate glyphs and
  features for titling, but the project has become a monster itself and I'm getting
  stuck in the way and I'm a bit desperate for a second opinion.\r\n\r\nOpen type
  programming and kerning have become a pain and I am aware of some inconsistency
  across some glyphs and symbols, curves are far from perfect and the are more problems
  for sure.. so I feel it may need a close analysis from someone outside to get to
  the critical points and have a real feel about the project.\r\n\r\nI have attached
  a PDF with the basic chart, alternate caps, small caps and diacritics. Please ask
  for more if you think you need closer details or anything that could help.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nRafa"

  body: "Hello Rafa,\r\n\r\nI found myself in this very same situation as I think
    a lot of people taking on a typeface for the first time found themselves. \r\n\r\nI'm
    by no means an expert in typeface design but I have tackled a few typeface projects
    already!\r\n\r\nCheck my work here if you like: http://www.behance.net/jonathanmartin\r\n\r\nFirstly
    I would recommend getting the book 'Designing Type' by Karen Cheng. This book
    is recommended by many professional typeface designers and it's a really excellent
    reference book - well worth the \xA320!\r\n\r\nI really like your design to begin
    with, some really interesting forms coming through! I started with a geometric
    for my first typeface design (Fassade) but the lowercase is the really challenge
    as I'm sure you may have already found.\r\n\r\nI think you need to be made aware
    of 'optical balancing' in typefaces. Although geometric typefaces give the impression
    all the strokes are the same weight this is not actually the case, certainly not
    in Futura's case.\r\nSo all the strokes will need adjusting slightly: the horizontal
    strokes are slightly thinner than the vertical strokes. If you where to look at
    futura close up and analyse the strokes you will see that their is a slight stroke
    weight variation. This stroke contrast becomes even greater in the bolder weights.
    \ \r\n(this is carefully examined and explained in 'Designing Type' book.)\r\n\r\nSecondly
    the other thing that needs attention is with the lowercase letters that contain
    a curved stroke meeting a straight stroke b, d, p, q for example. In Futura these
    are not just a circle bolted onto a straight stroke. As you will see if you were
    to closely examine Futura's b, p, q etc. the curved stroke tappers into the straight
    stroke. This is to  reducing the visual weight at the joint. Remember that typefaces
    are not mathematical structures (even geometrics) they have to prove themselves
    to the eye and rarely does this happen if they are made to strict mathematical
    shapes and grids. - Paul Renner's understanding of optics is what makes Futura
    such a brilliant design \r\n\r\nI strongly recommend that you get a hold of a
    copy of 'Designing Type', as it explains these details in typefaces much better
    than I ever could on this forum. \r\n\r\nYour design looks good at the moment
    it just requires some slight adjustments. I hope this has been useful. \r\n\r\nJonathan
    \r\n\r\n"

    body: "@JM Type Design\r\n\r\nHi Jonathan,\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply! I am already
      familiar with your work on behance and your types, I have to say Fassade project
      is really close to my approach, but maybe mine is a bit more radical in embracing
      geometry and the alternative forms  are a bit more experimental.\r\n\r\nI am
      also familiar with the optical balance made on Futura and other geometric types,
      and already got the Karen Cheng's book! A very helpful manual on typedesign
      on my opinion as well. The point is that I was trying to make those adjustments
      not so obvious to get a more radical look, as the font is intended to work as
      a display typeface I was trying to avoid the tapering of the stroke more subtle.
      \ For a bold font like this maybe those joints need more attention and I will
      need to taper them a bit more to reduce some weight. \r\n\r\nIf you think you
      can get into more detailed issues in the font or into concrete glyphs problems
      feel free to say whatever you think, it will sure be useful for me as I was
      looking for a second pair of eyes or more.   ;)"

  body: "This typeface really seems to combine the features of many typeface released
    at around the same time as Futura. Erbar Grotesk, Elegant Grotesk, Kabel, and
    the lowered waist on the R reminds me of architectural lettering like Neutraface.
    \r\n\r\nI think it might be a case of just getting the consistency right. There
    a lot of ideas going on at once, maybe try and refine these forms abit. For example
    see what happens if you lower the waists on the E, F, A etc like you have done
    with the R? On the other hand the features you all ready have will give each letter
    a unique voice, especially at display sizes. \r\n\r\nIt's a very careful balancing
    act. I think you defiantly need to find more of a balance so it becomes more of
    a functional tool and not just an experimental display face. I really like the
    E, the M, the Q has a really nice tail I think the only glyph that doesn't quite
    work is the C.\r\n\r\nJust keep plugging away looks great so far!"

  body: "Hi Jon, \r\n\r\nI've been thinking these days on doing just the opposite
    with the R glyph, and maybe rise their waist a bit to see if matches other glyphs
    like E, F, G and H... \r\n\r\nKnow the horizontal strokes of A, P and R have almost
    the same distance from the baseline and i think it could allow the trick so i
    can leave A, E, F like they are right now, and have their waist lowered only for
    the alternate caps which are also more expanded as you can see on the PDF.\r\n\r\nAnother
    major issue you could be right is about the C... I liked the look it gives to
    the font but perhaps it is just too much, maybe I can have this as an alternative
    form by using stylistic sets or having this on the alternate caps, and make the
    font a more functional tool as you say.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid these are busy days
    for me but I'll try to make those adjustments and upload the results asap.\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks for your help!"
