body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI'm just finishing up a font for a friend of mine called Ballet
  Mechanique. When I type text in Freehand the font renders onscreen out as a pixeled
  kinda block font (see attachement).\r\nI use most of my fonts in Freehand and they
  seem to be fine. I can't find a difference in the settings in FontLab 4.6. Is there
  something I'm overlooking? What is missing that this font will not look normal onscreen?\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n*** www.characters.nl  { Typography to express yourself

  body: "Ren\xE9, is it a Type 1 font? \r\nAnd is the name of the Font's suitcase
    \"BalletMechanique\"?\r\nIf this is the case, FreeHand doesn't know where to look
    for what, so it is having a devil of a time rendering the font on-screen.\r\nRename
    your suitcase to \"BalletMechanique.suit\" or .bmap or something."

    in this deal.

  body: Dan, didn't mean to make you feel bad. I think it's a funny idea. It's like
    Boeing buying Ford...

  body: "Thanks Chester. Generating an OpenType-CFF worked for me.\r\nI still don't
    know what the original problem was, but at least my worries are over.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone still might know the answer to my original question, please post it here.
    I'm very interested to find out what it might be.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n***
