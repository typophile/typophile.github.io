  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey fellow typophiles,

I just wrote an article on the premise that typography and hand-lettering are, in fact, very different disciplines (*gasp*), in order to clarify the definition because of the rampant misuse of terminology (we've all seen plenty of "35 Samples of Great Hand-Lettered Typography" articles). However, one of the reviewers was disturbed by this claim and demanded sources from "prominent typographers both contemporary and historical."

Does anyone know of sources that may satisfy this reviewer? I have a few quotes from books that I own that I can use, as well as Jessica Hische's talk at the Frontend 2011 conference (http://www.frontend2011.com/video/jessica-hische.html), but she is in fact a lettering artist and not a typographer, and I'd love to see if there are any serious typographers who'd have quotes on this. Thanks so much!</div>

In fact, even quotes from letterers would do, since I think the reviewer is persisting in using "typographer" to mean anyone having anything to do with letters.</div>

BTW, if you go to Noordzij you're opening a can of worms - remember he's the guy who claims "there's no essential difference between printing and handwriting" or some such codswallop.

This is exactly the reason why I quoted Noordzij in the first place : once you’ve got your head around this “can of worms” (I love that image, by the way), everything seems much easier to articulate. Well, it worked for me, that’s for sure.</div>

BTW in my view pretty much anything Noordzij has said is valid in proportion to its <em>distance</em> from type.

Haha, that is a good point about Noordzij! I looked up his site and it seems that what he is saying is simply that they're both a graphic representation of a spoken language, but there are major practical differences.

The premise of the article is that with the resurgence of mainstream popularity of type and lettering there has been a lot of confusion of terms among those who haven't put much study into it. It explains the basic definitions of typography and lettering, highlighting why we shouldn't use "typography" to mean lettering as is so commonly done, and gives a historical background of the development of each. Not much to argue with. The other reviewers were very positive.</div>

Which is of course more codswallop.

BTW can you get a hold of Erik Spiekermann? I'm sure he could put the nail in the coffin for you.
