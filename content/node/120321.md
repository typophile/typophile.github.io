  out roofing jobs, make sure your business is covered with the right insurance. Many
  homeowners and building owners will not even consider hiring your business if you
  do not have at least $1,000,000 in general liability insurance. In order to get
  roofing jobs, and in order to protect your business from potential lawsuits, you
  need to have insurance.<p><p>\r\n\r\nroofers insurance: Make Sure You Have A General
  Liability Insurance Policy<p><p>\r\n\r\nYou can make a bid without having general
  liability insurance; however, most <a href=\"http://contractorsliabilityinfo.wordpress.com/2014/10/07/why-roofing-contractors-should-maintain-liability-insurance/\">umbrella
  insurance</a> and business owners will not let you work on their roofs if you do
  not have at least $1,000,000 in general liability insurance coverage. Depending
  on where you are working, the local government may require you to carry a certain
  amount of liability coverage. It is important both for your customers and yourself
  that you have the right coverage.<p><p>\r\n\r\nWhat General Liability Insurance
  Covers<p><p>\r\n\r\nMost general liability insurance plans will offer you five basic
  coverage categories.<p><p>\r\n\r\nBodily Injury: If anyone is harmed at either your
  place of business, or if one of your employee's injured at a work site, your policy
  will cover their bills.<p><p>\r\n\r\nComplete Operations/Product Liability: This
  portion of your policy will cover any losses your business experiences after completing
  work for a customer.<p><p>\r\n\r\nPersonal Injury: This portion of your policy will
  pay for any damages to the either the reputation or rights of a person or business.
  This covers such issue as slander, copyright infringement, libel, invasion of privacy,
  etc.<p><p>\r\n\r\nAdvertising Injury: This will cover any losses that are caused
  due to advertising techniques that you employ.<p><p>\r\n\r\nIndependent Contractors
  Liability: This covers any damage from any independent contractor you hire<p><p>\r\n\r\nSub-contractors
  liability Coverage<p><p>\r\n\r\nIf you own a construction company and sub-contract
  out the roofing work, you need to have a special policy in place to protect your
  business. You need to have a sub contractors liability coverage policy. This policy
  will cover aspects that your general liability policy will not cover. If you are
  ever sued based on word done by a subcontractor, your general liability insurance
  will not cover the suit because it is not work done by your company, it is work
  done by another company. That is why you need sub-contractors liability coverage,
  so you can protect yourself and your business from any potential lawsuits stemming
  from work someone you sub-contracted out to preformed.<p><p>\r\n\r\nMake sure that
  your protect your roofing business from potential lawsuits and losses by having
  the right level of general liability insurance. If you sub-contract out jobs for
  your construction company, make sure you also have a sub-contractors liability policy
  in place.<p><p>"
