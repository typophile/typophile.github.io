body: "<strong>Question #1:</strong>\r\nWell, I am looking for something similar to
  Bryant by Process type foundry. Either similar in the fact that it has rounded terminals,
  or similar in the fact that it is friendly; the more weights, the better.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question
  #2:</strong>\r\nOnce I have this font (which may end up being Bryant if I can't
  find something out there more suiting) I would like suggestions of a text face to
  pair with it. Actually Microsoft\u2019s new Calibri really has that same type of
  vibe, and would work as a text face. If it wasn\u2019t the fact that it will be
  available on all the new windows system, it might be perfect candidate.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for helping my out with these types of questions. Typophile really is a valuable
  resource.\r\n"

    - each of these are available in a number of weights.

  body: Oops, sorry, misread... thought you wanted like Bryant w/out rounded terminals.
    How about Cholla from Emigre? Very friendly and readable.
