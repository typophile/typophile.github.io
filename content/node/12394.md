  advise against it: we own a license for Interstate which covers the corresponding
  weights she needs.\r\n\r\nShe insists.\r\n\r\nI tell her I fail to see the reason,
  and explain Blue Highway is a poor digitisation of exactly the same model.\r\n\r\nNo
  she won't have it, she will accept no substitute.\r\n\r\nExasperated, I ask her
  why we should spend money on an inferior design when we have the real deal!?\r\n\r\nShe
  says it looks a bit different, and she wants that exact look.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nSome
  days, authoritarian rule inexplicably sounds very appealing."

    character in the old TV show was a pretty witch who, with the wave of a finger,
    could make anything disappear (perhaps a client or two or just that portion of
    their brain that makes logical thought impossible).\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: ehehe. Yeah. It was with a wiggle/twitch of her nose and that little syncopated
    noise and things would happen. I remember wanting that power when I was little.

  body: OH. .... Yves. You bother because sometimes you can make a difference. If
    you gave up you wouldn't ever have the opportunity to grow. Education is something
    that is continuous and never-ending. Even and especially for ourselves.
