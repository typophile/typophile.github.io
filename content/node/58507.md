body: "I recently downloaded a font, [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/RockoFLF|RockoFLF]],
  and have been loving it, except that I've noticed one small problem with it.\r\n\r\nBasically,
  when using the font in Illustrator CS4 (PC), I notice that sometimes the counters
  of the \"a\" and other letters go a bit crazy, and it makes the weight vary in some
  point sizes. But then the effect disappears in other point sizes. The screenshot
  below shows you what I'm talking about. The letters in black are how they should
  be, but the ones in pink show the errors. And the funny thing is it all corrects
  itself if I convert the text to paths.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if this is a hinting
  problem with the font, and if it's possible to correct something like this in a
  free program like Fontforge?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rocko_4566.png]"

  body: Yes, bad TrueType hinting. Should be fixable in FontForge (but I have never
    used FF for hinting).

  body: "Daydream, \r\n\r\nif you want to use a free tool, you could either use FontForge
    to regenerate the TrueType hinting, or you could do something else: use Adobe
    FDK for OpenType to convert the font into OpenType PS (.otf) and autohint it at
    the same time. After installing the Adobe FDK for OpenType from http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/
    just type in Terminal/commandline the two lines one by one: \r\n\r\n<code>makeotf
    -f RockoFLF.ttf\r\nautohint -nb RockoFLF.otf</code>\r\n\r\nand use the final RockoFLF.otf.
    The PostScript hinting model used in OpenType PS fonts tend to be more robust
    and less prone to \"strange errors\" caused by automatic hinting. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
