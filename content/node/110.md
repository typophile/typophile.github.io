  with myself to stop design work early on fridays to start up a font ideas. So, this
  last friday I started in on a grotesque &#40;purely for the name of course&#41;.
  Just making one little design decision after another I arrived at what follows.
  About 20 glyphs into it realized I&#39;d just drawn helvetica. Lame. <BR> <BR>At
  that point obvious differences were the: a, k,  s and y. So I started working on
  variants some of which are included in the gif &#40;really the only successful one
  is the two story g which is rough when you get up close&#41;. So I guess I&#39;m
  looking for feedback of two kinds, 1&#41; how could what I have be better drawn
  technically, and 2&#41; any other ideas on how this could change. We need something
  like this about as badly as we need another humanist sans. I thought  about turning
  it into a slab serif? Thoughts? <BR> <BR>BTW, this is the first time I have ever
  made it all the way through a lower case so if only for that reason it was worth
  it :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR>Randy <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10695.gif"

  body: Actually, even though I think there are other genres more worthy of effort,
    to me a good, relatively readable Grotesque isn&#39;t nearly as cliche as a humanist
    sans. If you resist making it cloyingly grot &#40;which however is somewhat fashionable
    now&#41; and keep readability in mind, you might end up with a new workhorse.
    That binocular &#34;g&#34;, the &#34;k&#34;, and those angled stems for example
    make me think you&#39;re on the right track. What I might do differently is making
    it slightly narrower, and pulling in the descenders a bit. And keep an eye on
    Franklin Gothic, both for inspiration and to avoid coming too close to it. <BR>

    as cliche as a humanist sans.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll disagree, I think that&#39;s
    the opposite. Imho, the grotesque style is  <BR>almost a cliche in itself. Minimum
    stroke-contrast, closed shapes,  <BR>horizontal terminals, all these characteristics
    from grotesque typefaces  <BR>restrain the rising of &#42;new&#42; grotesques.
    In the other hand, you can  <BR>experiment more with humanist sans and achieve
    much more useful  <BR>results. Open and cursive shapes allow that.  <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Excellent! Don&#39;t know why but this design makes me smile. <BR> <BR>Stuff
    I dig: <BR>- Double-story g. <BR>- Alternate j. &#40;I&#39;m not so brave&#41;
    <BR>- Alternate i and j in text. Especially in the word little. <BR>- Slanted
    ends on the c, e, s. &#40;Maybe make them parallel?&#41; <BR>- The k &#40;Star
    of the set&#41; <BR> <BR>Stuff to notice: <BR>- I think the tail on the a works
    ok. Maybe it should be a bit <BR>bigger. It extends ok to the b and d, but it
    feels out of <BR>place up top on the p and q, and a little less weird on n <BR>and
    m. Hmm... what am I saying. Make the bigger every- <BR>where. Helvetica needs
    all the help it can get. <BR>- The arm of the a bulges near the end. I think the
    arm on <BR>that BCP needs to be slanted to the right a bit instead <BR>of pointing
    straight up. <BR>- The y really does look like it got stepped on. It looks ok
    <BR>in the text sample though, but I suspect it&#39;s because it <BR>sits next
    to the g. <BR>- Speaking of the g, neither version descends as far as the <BR>rest
    of the descenders. Here&#39;s a chance to open things up <BR>a bit more if that&#39;s
    your wish. <BR>- The outer curves of some characters, o, e, c, look a bit <BR>square.
    This makes the strokes at 45 degrees seem too <BR>thick. I like to call this the
    square marker effect since you <BR>get this sort of stroke modulation from drawing
    with a fat <BR>square sharpie&#41; <BR>- The v, w, and x look like they&#39;re
    falling to the left and <BR>they&#39;re a bit dark. <BR> <BR>I dig this design
    on the whole. I called my second list stuff <BR>to notice because I have a natural
    inclination to turn any <BR>design into its closest relative, in this case helvetica,
    so <BR>ignore any advice that might have this effect. <BR> <BR>The beziers on
    the s look right on. The lower curve at the <BR>left end of the spine is a bit
    too square compared to the <BR>its sibling.'

  body: 'Thanks again for the input. I dropped all the glyphs into fontographer to
    set some text. I hit auto space and auto bitmaps so it kinda stinks. Anyone have
    advise for strategies on this &#40;perhaps a new thread&#41;. Particularly in
    getting decent bitmaps so you can make intelligent design decisions. I haven&#39;t
    the first clue about hinting.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve made some changes based on your
    feedback: <BR> <BR>- Adjusted the tails. They are truely spurs now, but not high
    heels &#40; a turnoff in Franklin Gothic&#41; <BR>- Adjusted the bulging &#34;a&#34;
    <BR>- Lightened and hopefully corrected the v, w, x <BR>- Narrowed the &#34;y.&#34;
    I wanted to avoid the standard tail, but hopefully it doesn&#39;t look to stomped
    anymore. <BR>- Re-drew the binocular g. The curves are much better now, but the
    bottom is light - grrrr. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t got a laser printer at the home

    changing them over and over until  <BR>you get satisfied. <BR>Anyway, try removing
    &#40;merge in fog&#41; the blue points. You <BR>won&#39;t need them, imho. And
    then, try changing the red  <BR>points as I sketched above. <BR> <BR>Good luck

    <BR> <BR>Your weight is dark, and your &#40;overall&#41; spacing matches it well.
    But -for text- such a dark weight works best at smaller sizes, for which you&#39;d
