  a bit; I'm looking for the sort of Latin with the bouncy baseline.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getsmart_6222.gif]"

  body: I think your best option is to get a font like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/latin_bold/&sample_text=GET%20SMART&sample_size=36">Latin
    Bold</a> and bounce the baseline yourself. A few curve tweaks and you're there.
