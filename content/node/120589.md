  body: The |R| differences appears to me to be just caused by different weight and
    poor image quality.

  body: "For the words THOR HEYERDAHL consider a condensed version of Trend Sans One
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrendSansOneAsThor_3974.gif] https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/trend/
    This is all lowercase, except for _A_.\r\nI note that the _R_. which appears twice
    in this phrase, is different from the _R_ on PIONEER.  So PIONEER appears to be
    a different font. \r\nThe unusual _N_ in PIONEER is the same as the _N_ in COGNAC
    so they are presumably the same font. I have seen the unusual _G_ in COGNAC somewhere...\r\nDon"

    a _G_ I digitized from the end credits of King Kong, 2005 version. Still looking
