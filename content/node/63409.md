body: "The latest entry in the developing web font ecosystem: Peter Bi\u013Eak's new
  web font service, offering served web licensed versions of all Typotheque fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/webfonts\r\n\r\nLike
  services such as Typekit and Kernest, the fonts are served by the font provider
  not directly from the users own servers. But in this case, the font provider is
  the foundry rather than a third party. The license cost is a one-time fee, not a
  subscription. The number of URLs is not limited. Perhaps most interesting from a
  typographic point of view, Typotheque's service is able to provide richer layout
  support by serving appropriate glyphs for e.g. smallcaps to browsers that do not
  natively support OpenType Layout."

  body: Thanks, Miguel. I don't follow the Release board, so hadn't noticed that thread.
    I still think it is worthwhile bringing attention to this service in the general
    discussion area, though, as a contribution to the ongoing discussion of web font
    formats and services.
