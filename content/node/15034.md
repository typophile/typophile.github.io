  body: "Nope... not Helvetica Inserat. That \"W\" is very unique to only a few faces.
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/univers/59-ultra-condensed/testdrive.html?s=VA+NIEUW&p=60\">Univers</a>
    for one.  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger/67-bold-condensed/testdrive.html?s=VA+NIEUW&p=60\">Frutiger</a>
    for another. And <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/antique-olive-sb/con/testdrive.html?s=VA+NIEUW&p=60\">Antique
    Olive</a> for yet another. \r\n\r\nBut none seem to fit a squeezed and compressed
    version.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nYes, I'm old, but
    I'm back in style!"

  body: I notice the cap N is not at the same angle as the rest of the lowercase text
    (look at the negative space). This leads me to believe its another case of artificially
    slanting and possibly condensing of a perfectly good typeface.
