  competition for a new program they're going to start.  I don't know much abowt it
  but all I know is you can win an Adobe CS3 Suite.  That's it. I think the website
  is www.fordscholars.com.....or it could be www.fordscholars.org...I'm drawing a
  blank right now...sorry...\r\n\r\nThat's it...\r\n\r\n"

    you do any work...if you're a non-US resident.

  body: "Funny. The rules *say* fordscholars.com, but the text links to [[http://www.fordscholars.org/]].\r\n\r\n\"This
    United States based logo competition is open to all legal residents of the fifty
    (50) United States (including District of Columbia). Competition is open to amateur
    and professional designers. Ford Motor Company Fund and Ford Motor Company Fund
    employees or retirees, or immediate family members of a Ford Motor Company Fund
    or Ford Motor Company Fund employee or retiree are not eligible to participate.
    Participation can only take place in a private personal capacity.\"\r\n\r\nI always
    have mixed feelings about corporate logo/design contests. They're usually just
    a way to get good work with no budget. On the flip side, some contests\u2013this
    one included\u2013open up a fairly high profile project to students and young
    designers.\r\n\r\nI agree with Sharon that FMC ought to be able to come up with
    more dough. However, this is probably a project within the company that wasn't
    budgeted much by the higher ups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Shame on Ford for exploiting graphic designers. Would they hold a contest
    for engineers to design a new suspension system? Would they hold a contest for
    lawyers to come up with new wording for their warranty? For-profit companies should
    hire professionals and pay market rates for whatever they need.

    really should just fess up and call it 'plea for a logo donation...'"

  body: "So the contest is for a logo for \"Ford Blue Oval Scholars\"?\r\n\r\nI could
    understand if it was a design competition to redesign the Ford logo.  A company
    as big as Ford would want new ideas from outside an agency.  Agencies can be such
    a pain to deal with sometimes.\r\n\r\nBut, this seems like an insignificant logo
    and Ford is just looking for design on the cheap.  Shame on you Ford.  We have
    to make a living too.  They should have just posted the logo design on elance.com
    for a russian or indian to make one for $5 (kidding)\r\n\r\nHEY FORD! Visit here:\r\nhttp://www.no-spec.com/\r\n"

  body: yeah, i understand the "over 18" age requirement, but what's up with the "under
    29"? that just seems weird...

  body: on the broader subject, this is not a major corporate logo; it's for a small
    side project. i don't think it's particularly bad for ford to open the logo up
    to designers (especially those in their specific desired demographic)... it gives
    the promotion a lot more exposure (would we even be talking about here otherwise,
    or would we have to just react to the studio-designed logo after it was unveiled?)
    AND could potentially give some great-idea but under exposed designer good ink.

  body: Matt9302323...that's how all logo contests work. The best work never wins.
    If you must enter design contests, be sure to submit only half-assed work, as
    that's the only ones that ever win. ;o)
