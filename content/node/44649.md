  body: Veer.com has an enormous library of script typefaces such as  Kitti or Hucklebuck,
    but they are notoriously expensive. I guess they are around the same as the suggestion
    Chris gave you.

  body: "First, neither of these are typefaces. This wonderful mark was hand lettered.\r\n\r\nI
    strongly advise against using a typefaces here \u2014\_especially for the script.
    I love type and I could recommend a few fonts that we sell, but this sort of logo
    was meant to be drawn by hand on a circle and that's nearly impossible to achieve
    well with a font. Get a [[lettering]] artist like <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/letteringdesign.html\">Mark
    Simonson</a>  to assist you. Your client will appreciate a unique, handcrafted
    mark with letters that no one else can replicate."

  body: Hand lettering is always the best choice, but doing a friend a favor may not
    have the biggest budget. If it's in the budget scope for the job,  have the ability
    yourself, or have the resources to do so, then by all means go with Stephen's
    suggestion.

  body: My worst fears are true. This business has been around for 100 years but only
    has old photocopies or small scanned low res digital files of this logo. I wish
    hand lettering was an option but this is a favor for a friend. Is there any font
    out there that is similar to the "salt water taffy" bit. I'm probably going to
    make everyone cringe with then next statement but my last resort will be to scan
    and enlarge an old copy enough to attempt to recreate it in illustrator. Thanks
    for all the comments so far, I really appreciate it![img:sites/default/files/old-images/dolles2_6408.jpg]

  body: I agree about the hand lettering but  [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/|Letterhead
    Fonts]] has some talented font designers and a nice gallery of vintage-style signs.

  body: "I see a lot of printed pieces on Dolle's website including boxes and wrappers.
    Have you tried contacting them or their printer? I think I'm a little unclear
    as to whether this is for Dolle's itself or an \"unofficial\" use for a friend
    (or even a logo that simply looks like Dolle's).\r\n\r\nFor others:\r\nhttp://www.dolles.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=details&prodID=26\r\n"

  body: The design work is for Dolles (the original in Ocean City) and will be official.
    I've been getting the runaround from the printer which supposedly only has a .jpg,
    so that is why I am trying to recreate it. The web designer only has the small
    image I posted at the beginning. Thank you all for your time and comments.
