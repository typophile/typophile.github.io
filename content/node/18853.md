  of Credit</em>: I saw a pile of paperback copies of it at St. Mark's Bookshop this
  weekend, going for 9 dollars (there is a remainders table in the back of the store).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
  their remaindered books are not offered on <a href=\"http://www.stmarksbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp\">their
  website</a>. :-("
