  body: "I do not recall a thick and thin sans with ball terminals on y and r.\r\nIf
    it does not turn up the letters may have been made by clipping serifs off an old
    style typeface [note the angled bowl on the p] with ball terminals. Look for example
    at the very common Times New Roman Medium:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TimesNewRomanMed_5499.jpg]\r\nWith
    a slight stretching of width of the lowercase and shrinkage of the capitals,  this
    seems like an almost perfect fit.\r\nDon"

  body: Hmmm! Thanks so much you guy's. Times is what I kept coming up with in searching,
    but the serifs were throwing me off. I was on the right track, just not smart
    enough to think of cutting the serifs off.  ;)
