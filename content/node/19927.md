body: "Good evening!\r\n\r\nThis font is based from memory off of a poster that my
  grandparents in West Virginia have; I haven't actually seen the poster for a few
  years because each time I'm there I forget to look at it. It's some interesting
  geometric art, including the text \r\n\r\nyoshiko\r\nmcgaw editions\r\n\r\nin this
  lettering. (It also has an alternate, much thinner c and s that I will make soon.)
  I discovered that \"McGaw Editions\" is a company that makes posters, but when I
  emailed them to ask if they could tell me about that particular one, they couldn't
  find it in their database. (I assume it's just old, and predates their digital age.)
  I think it was probably hand-drawn because (1) it's old and (2) I haven't been able
  to find anything similar, except for one that was similar but not it (I can't find
  it again or remember its name). Anyways, tell me what you think. "

    contrast between the thin characters and the wider ones is huge, it adds a lot
    of character.\r\nNot very easily read, but cool none the less."

  body: "Frankly I'm not sure why, but I think this has potential.\r\nSomething about
    the... terminals maybe, is making it special.\r\n\r\nf: no good.\r\ni/j: make
    dots round? In any case, align tops of dots with ascenders.\r\nr: beak needs help.\r\ns:
    some people will tell you to make the stroke weight distribution conventional;
    I suggest you smile and ignore them. But do make the bottom-right curve smoother.\r\np/q:
    it might actually make sense to make their descenders shorter than the others.
    Maybe the \"j\"'s too (although maybe not as short).\r\nt: weak.\r\nv: good idea,
    but a bit too full.\r\n\r\nA: a bit TOO wide.\r\nI: consider serifs.\r\nJ: flatten
    terminal shear.\r\nL/T: too narrow.\r\nQ: come on, live a little!  :-)\r\nS/V:
    same as in lc.\r\nY: unsure; maybe try using your \"v\" structure.\r\n\r\nnumerals:
    rationalist. niiice. The \"one\" is bril.\r\n\r\nPilcrow: dump the little bar
    in the middle of the stems. And you need more heft, somewhere - that's how a pilcrow
    works.\r\n%: the bar is cool, but flatten it.\r\n&: thmooooz.\r\n#: I can dig
    it.\r\n[/]: longer bars, probably.\r\n(/): wishful thinking - too much like square
    brackets.\r\nguillemets: make more angular.\r\ncedilla: out of character.\r\naccents:
    the ring is bril, the diaeresis is OK, the rest are out of character.\r\n$: nice.\r\nYen:
    I'd use one bar; if not, lower them.\r\nBP: not working. Try a smaller top.\r\neszet:
    squashed head. Let it be what it needs to be.\r\n\r\nSpacing: too tight; the stem-stems
    are bunching.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "my personal feelings:\r\nthe spacing is toooooooooooo tight. it could be
    loosened, if even just a tad.\r\nthe ascenders are toooooooooooo short. even a
    slight bit of adjustment would help readability. i kept reading the d as an a."

  body: too loose and it will lose its charm. this could never be a text-face or even
    a subhead-face, but as a display-face it has some retro promise.

  body: "I think Paul is right about the ascenders. Tiffany is quite right, too, but
    a little more unevenness would make it more lively. Hrant is right about the numerals
    as well: their style is a counterpoint to most of the letters' one.\r\n\r\nMy
    idea: heighten the ascenders a little, differentiate a bit some forms to get rid
    of an excessive homogeneous quality. Don't know how to do it without loosing the
    general feeling, anyway."
