body: 'This may be old news to many, but I finally got around to reading the article
  in the current issue of <i>Print</i> on the development of Clearview. <BR> <BR>Clearview
  first came to my attention in the TDC newsletter a couple years back. It was quite
  a while before I learned that James had originally developed it as a highway signage
  type.  <BR> <BR>Last fall, when I was driving through Pennsylvania, I got a kick
  out of seeing some of the more recent signs set in Clearview. Of course, I had to
  point them all out to my wife, who was not nearly as amused. <BR> <BR>Most of the
  article&#39;s subject matter was covered in James&#39;s highly entertaining presentation
  at last year&#39;s TypeCon. <i>&#40;Note to Tamye: This year, don&#39;t schedule
  James first thing Sunday morning -- he deserves a primetime slot.&#41;</i> <BR>
  <BR>But it was fascinating to hear again about the long, molasses-swimming process
  of designing a project like this. For a general article in a design magazine, I
  thought it did a decent job of making this somewhat unglamorous aspect of the craft
  interesting for the average reader. And I commend the author for tackling the topic.
  It was a refreshing change from the glorified portfolio fluff that is so common.
