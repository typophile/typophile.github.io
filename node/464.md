body: 'Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently working on some Cyrillic fonts, my
  first. I&#39;m just getting a feel for the forms right now. <BR> <BR>I have a font
  that has regular Latin upper/lower case and small caps, and I&#39;m now filling
  out the character set with Cyrillic letters. Should I be using the small cap height
  for the Cyrillic x-height? Since there are many lower case Cyrillic letters that
  look basically the same as a Latin small cap, this would simplify things. Then again,
  some Cyrillic lower case look like Latin lower case as well. <BR> <BR>But beyond
  that, it&#39;s an issue of color: should the Cyrillic lower case have the same weight
  as a Latin set of small caps? Or should they go more with the Latin lower case &#40;very
  slightly lighter&#41;, and also use its smaller x-height? But some of the Cyrillic
  lower case letters seem to demand more space, due to their being based directly
  off of the upper case &#40;such as Yah, which looks like a backwards small cap R&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Since it would be a rare situation in which Cyrillic lower case are standing
  next to Latin characters &#40;small caps or lower case&#41;, I imagine that maintaining
  a level of consistency with regard to x-height is probably not a big deal. <BR>
  <BR>Lastly, is there such a thing as Cyrillic small caps? It seems almost redundant,
  but I could see the possibility of them existing &#40;I&#39;ve just never seen any
  before&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Alan'

    I have been spending a lot of time looking at and evaluating how scripts [should]
    behave when mixed. <BR> <BR>&#62; Should I be using the small cap height for the
    Cyrillic x-height? <BR> <BR>Which smallcaps? Aren&#39;t you the guy who makes
    7 sizes of smallcaps?  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously, my view &#40;which stems from
    some informal linguistic analysis&#41; is that a smallcaps height which is notably
    taller than the x-height is indeed the best guide for the Cyrillic &#34;x-height&#34;.
    You can see the necessity for this as soon as you look at some text using the
    same guide for the x-heights of both Cyrillic and Latin: the former looks secondary,
    in apparent size. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, you should know that this stance
    is somewhat anti-establishment. People like John Hudson &#40;who I admit design
    aesthetically very solid Cyrillic fonts&#41; are in the majority when they say
    that the x-heights should be the same. But they&#39;re wrong. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;
    maintaining a level of consistency with regard to x-height is probably not a big
    deal. <BR> <BR>In fact that&#39;s a clue as to the boundary between immersive
    versus deliberative reading: in the former &#40;like setting a book&#41; you need
    overall balance of texture/size more, while in the latter &#40;like setting a
    poster&#41; you need &#40;or at least might prefer&#41; visual alignment. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I personally go even further and state that characters that
    seem to have identical structures in both scripts should actually have <i>different</i>
    renderings! The reason is two-fold: emphasizing &#40;even exagerating&#41; cultural
    authenticity; and improving differentiation. For example look at the &#34;Getty&#34;
    sample on my link above: if it weren&#39;t for those parentheses, the reader would
    be seriously thrown off. <BR> <BR>As an example of what I&#39;m talking about
    in real life, check out the Cyrillic of Quadraat. John doesn&#39;t like it - I
    love it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    differences by drawing &#40;visually&#41; common letters separately. This is exactly
    what I plan to do. <BR> <BR>About the small caps: yeah, I&#39;m all about quantity.
    It&#39;s actually not that family that I&#39;m working on, but another. I think
    I will plod along with a Cyrillic x-height matching the Latin small caps, slightly
    higher than the Latin lower case. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s been a while since I looked

  body: 'BTW, another reason to vary the rendering of [superficially] identical characters
    is notan &#40;the balance of black and white&#41;: if one script likes its letterspacing
    looser than the other &#40;for example as a result of a greater proportion of
    vertical stems versus rounds, like in Armenian&#41;, that would act to increase
    the internal white as well - and vice versa. <BR> <BR>The tricky thing, however,
    is how to make the differentiation non-hoaky. I think it was John who said/claimed
    that Quadraat-Cyrillic&#42; isn&#39;t just &#34;divergent&#34;, it&#39;s inauthentic.
    I might have to take his word for that, but I can&#39;t help but remember a standard
    disclaimer of mine: what most type designers consider inauthentic might be just
    fine in the eyes of the reader. In any case, it clearly takes a greater-than-otherwise
    cultural sensitivity - when you opt not to copy the establishment, you&#39;re
    deeper in the forest. <BR> <BR>&#42; <BR>Here&#39;s an image I used during my

  body: The Cyrillic may look so much smaller, partly due to the lack of ascenders.
    And to my non-Russian eyes, some of those letters look awfully snug. <BR> <BR>But
    then how about the same writing system for a different language, like Ukranian
    or Serbian? They use Cyrillic characters, but add a few letters that have ascenders
    &#40;or dots&#41; that fill some of the space above the lower case. <BR> <BR>The
    Quadraat Cyrillic Italic does look a bit affected in places. I think the gaps
    in letters like the zhe and kah are distracting for a lower case, and the descending
    zeh?! Is that what that is? Looks like it was just borrowed from the old-style
    three? <BR> <BR>If John Hudson is around to chime in, that would be great. <IMG

  body: 'I can&#39;t comment on the individual letter issues you mention &#40;I&#39;m
    simply not familiar with them&#41;, but in terms of relative apparent size, it
    is in fact the proportion of extenders &#40;mostly ascenders, yes&#41; that causes
    the difference, assuming the color is equivalent. Interestingly, any difference
    in width &#40;noting that the Cyrillic letters have much greater average width&#41;
    seems not to matter - and I think I know why: lines are set horizonally, and line
    breaks &#34;absorb&#34; the width difference. But the Cyrillic text will generally
    run longer &#40;especially since English is a very terse language&#41;, and you
    could say that&#39;s where the greater width makes itself felt. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    also interesting to note that the Ukranian/Serbian factor affects Latin as well,
    in fact more so! I once did a study of the relative vertical span of 6 Latinate
    languages, and the two extremes &#40;English and Polish&#41; were pretty far apart.
    Ergo: Polish needs to be a set a little bit smaller than any parallel English!
    But to do this sort of thing you need to look closely at letter frequencies, not
    just the alphabet. The Greek alphabet for example has a greater proportion of
    extending characters than English, but in real text it&#39;s even more confined
    to the x-height! <BR> <BR>BTW, Maxim Zhukov &amp; George Sadek&#39;s &#34;Typographia
    polyglotta&#34; is a great resource for developing some linguistic sensitivity
    towards mixed typesetting. Just try not to squirm when you read the last paragraph
    on page xvi... to me it almost ruins the whole point of the book! But that slip

    <BR>The sample Polish text on Omniglot doesn&#39;t look too riddled with extenders,

    written in the Latin alphabet! For some reason I had always thought that Vietnamese
    had no written language until it was forced upon them in a Latin form, but clearly
    I was wrong. But given the complicated accents, you could see how one could assume
    that the written form was an afterthought. But that&#39;s an entirely different

    <BR> <BR>In general, you can notice that the &#34;Bulgarian style&#34; of Cyrillic
    letters usually involves more ascenders and descenders than the &#34;Russian style&#34;,
    e.g. in &#34;ve&#34;, &#34;zhe&#34;, &#34;ka&#34; or &#34;yu&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Also,
    the upright letterforms &#34;ge&#34;, &#34;de&#34;, &#34;te&#34; or &#34;sha&#34;
    often have the same styllistic features as the corresponding italic forms.  <BR>
    <BR>Some experts disagree that these &#34;Bulgarian variants&#34; really are representative.
    My suspicion is that Russian-style Cyrillic is perfectly acceptable to Bulgarian
    readers just as the Bulgarian-style forms, while the opposite isn&#39;t true:
    the Russian-style forms are the only ones acceptable for Russian readers.  <BR>
    <BR>Serbian-style Cyrillic:  <BR> <BR>Similarly, there are some particular letterforms
    that are distinct in Serbian-style Cyrillic -- especially in italic style. These
    include &#34;ge&#34;, &#34;de&#34;, &#34;pe&#34; and &#34;te&#34; that tend to
    be more influenced by calligraphy than in the Russian-style Cyrillic. Helvetica
    Linotype implements this in the OpenType &#34;locl&#34; feature.  <BR> <BR>Please
    note that, for example, Jovica Veljovic&#39;s Cyrillic designs tend to be slightly
    more of Serbian style than of Russian style.  <BR> <BR>There are good samples
    of Cyrillic and Western character sets of fonts designed or adapted by ParaType
    designers and other Russian designers &#40;especially the work by Vladimir Yefimov
    and Tagir Safayev is worth checking&#41;.  <BR> <BR>For example, check out Vladimir

    <BR>I consider Matthew Carter, John Hudson and Gary Munch as the designers who
    are most successful among non-natives in designing Cyrillic letterforms. Carter&#39;s
    Georgia and Verdana, Hudson&#39;s Sylfaen and Helvetica Linotype, and Munch&#39;s
    Really are exceptionally well-designed Cyrillics. I also think Robert Slimbach&#39;s
    &#40;and Carol Twombly&#39;s&#41; designs for Minion and Myriad are well done.  <BR>
    <BR>Finally, I&#39;d recommend contacting experienced and highly valued experts
    who could express some critique on your letterforms. I think contacting Maxim
    Zhukov, Vladimir Yefimov and Jovica Veljovic would be best choice.  <BR> <BR>Best

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>Hrant, <BR>i am sorry. if you looking for ideal
    cyrillic, look on Minion, Myriad or Georgia <BR> <BR>Alan, <BR>can you show any
    samples? i am very interested. <BR>x-height is same like latin lower case. cyrillic
    small caps burn a discussion, but generally not availaible. but SC not the same
    as LC anyway <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    as we seemed to have arrived atr in this thread, it rarely <i>should</i> be, because
    that makes the Latin text look bigger &#40;= more important&#41; than the Cyrillic.

  body: 'Hi! I&#39;ve run into this discussion by chance, and obviously, too late.
    A few things got mixed up here.  <BR> <BR>1. That the small caps <i>exist</i>
    in Cyrillic, is an indisputable fact, impossible to deny. Good typography is hardly
    possible without small caps, either in Western languages, or in Russian, or other
    languages using Cyrillic. Just have a look at the digital fonts offered by ParaType
    that feature &#39;SCOSF&#39; character sets. <BR> <BR>2. That in multilingual
    typefaces that cover both Latin and Cyrillic scripts <i>the same x-height</i>
    is used, is another fact. One can theorise ad infinitum whether this is the best
    solution but that&#39;s the way it is &#40;challenging this practice has nothing
    to do with being &#39;anti-establishment&#39;: this is pure <i>coquetterie</i>&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>3. In designing multilingual typefaces that cover both Latin and Cyrillic
    scripts it is standard to use <i>identical shapes</i> for different characters
    in both sets: for example, the capital A, B, C, E, H, I, J, [K], M, O, P, S, T,
    X, and the lower-case a, c, e, i, j, o, p, s, x, and y &#40;in roman, and more
    in italic&#41;.  <BR> <BR>4. Yes, Russian text <i>looks different</i> from English
    when set in the same point size, on the same leading, track, with the same horizontal
    scale, etc. Of course, in the same typographic format English text looks different
    from Italian, Spanish text looks different from Danish, etc., despite they all
    use Latin script.  <BR> <BR>5. Adam, I never told you that Cyrillic lowercase
    should be <i>designed</i> with slightly larger x-height than Latin. What I shared
    with you was a <i>typesetting</i>, not a type design, tip. Manipulating the point
    size and the tracking is sometimes necessary for better visual balance of the
    Russian text with the text in English, or in any other language using Latin script.
    <BR> <BR>6. The design of <b>Quadraat</b> Cyrillic I find pretty amateurish, and
    the typeface unusable. As to <b>Minion</b>, that was the very first digital Cyrillic
    with a good pedigree, and one of the first typefaces the young Robert Slimbach
    did for Adobe; however, I am certain that to-day he could come up with a much
    better design.'

    <BR> <BR>Yes, it looks smaller, no? Doesn&#39;t that convey &#34;less important&#34;?
    <BR> <BR>&#62; What I shared with you was a typesetting, not a type design, tip.
    <BR> <BR>But why not translate that to the type itself, instead of assuming the
    typographer is an expert? Aren&#39;t &#34;smart&#34; fonts good? The recent Whitman
    comes to mind: in the elaboration in Kent&#39;s PDF there are descriptions of
    many &#34;tricks&#34; he&#39;s incorporated that work <i>in spite</i> of the typographer.
    <BR> <BR>In fact, I see a good reason to move that feature &#40;differing x-heights&#41;
    &#34;deeper&#34;, to the type design itself: if you take a font with Latin and
    Cyrillic components &#40;where the color has been matched for the same point size,
    as it will always be if it&#39;s any good&#41; and scale one slightly larger,
    it will look darker too. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not disputing what the standards are,
    I&#39;m just pointing out functional problems with them. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>I am very sorry that I incorrectly remembered your advice you gave me some

    enlarged x-height, but rather to give some extra horizontal space by slightly
    increasing the sidebearings of the Cyrillic glyphs as compared to Latin. I&#39;ve
    mixed these things up, for what I&#39;m sorry.  <BR> <BR>BTW: I just returned

  body: Alan,  <BR> <BR>the Ukrainians &#40;and Russians, I think&#41; like to put
    mayonnaise in their salads, so one needs to be sparse with them. The strongest
    side of the local cuisine are fish and sea fruits. You can get salmon in numerous
    incarnations. Also, since the Tatars and Armenians were and are present on Crimea,
    you get tasteful shasliks and other meat dishes mainly involving lamb. You also
    get various ravioli-like specialties such as pelmeni or vareniki. Crimea has fine
    wines and Champagne-like sparling wines. And, of course, you get caviar that is
    incredibly affordable &#40;less than $50 per 100g&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Of course, I
    couldn&#39;t resist making some photos of the lettering, but I tried to restrain
    myself. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    guess the reason for it is that Cyrillic has more straight stems than rounds compared
    to Latin. <BR> <BR>When I was designing Nour&amp;Patria it became clear that even
    cognate forms &#40;like vo/&#34;n&#34;&#41; have to be spaced differently &#40;looser
    for the Armenian&#41; because of the exact same issue &#40;although probably not
    as pronounced&#41;. <BR> <BR>Where this becomes even more interesting is this:
    if you accept that a glyph&#39;s black shape depends on the white &#40;both inside
    and outside&#41;, then you realize that looser spacing means the black shape has
    to change too! <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Adam, did you see the ghost of Khrimian Hayrig?
    ;-&#41; <BR>He was a famous Armenian priest from that peninsula. After seeing
    Armenian issues get demoted from 16th to 61st priority during two subsequent post-WWI
    conferences, he gave us this cherished proverb: &#34;To drink from the soup of
    the world, you must have an iron ladle.&#34; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
