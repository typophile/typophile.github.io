  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>When I hear the term <cite>Modern</cite> in the context of a typeface design, a very clear image of what that looks like comes to mind. I also associate it with its own history, geography, etc.</p>
<p>The same goes for the term <cite>Scotch</cite>.</p>
<p>However – undoubtedly because the latter evolved partially from the former – there are many typefaces which I might term either way. In my head there is this kind of scale between Modern and Scotch that looks something like this:
|Modern&mdash;&mdash;|&ndash;overlap&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;Scotch|</p>
<p>So, my question (lightly aimed at Nick Shinn) is this: What are the lines between Scotch and Modern? Are all Scotches (Scotts?) necessarily Moderns? At what point is a typeface beyond-a-doubt Scotch or non-Scotch?</p>
<p>Knowing a typeface&rsquo;s origins and design history tends to bias my distinction on a case-by-case basis, so I&rsquo;d be curious to get more of an understanding from a purely formal approach. Specific examples would help a lot too.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is an issue that can&rsquo;t be nailed down with 100% precision, but if it could, I&rsquo;m sure it would happen here.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The characteristics of the Modern (Didone) style are:</p>
<p>High contrast
Vertical stress
Unbracketed serifs</p>
<p>The class of Scotch types meets the first two criteria, but its adherence to the third varies.</p>
<p>The Scotch has bracketed serifs.</p>
<p>There are two ways of looking at this&ndash;strictly taxonomic (i.e. what the physical features are), or philogenic (how they evolved).</p>
<p>So we have the Panose system, with</p>
<p>cove
obtuse cove
obtuse square cove
square cove
square</p>
<p>which are taxonomic</p>
<p>and IBM with</p>
<p>transitional
modern (didone)
clarendon
slab</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Some wrinkles:</p>
<p>The Century styles are Scotch, but in headline faces they tend towards modern, and in text, towards slab.
Times Roman has Scotch capitals, but not lower case&ndash;except in the bold. Bit of a mash-up.
Press gain on letterpress text gives the impression of subtle bracketing.</p>
<p>When Richard Austin, inventor of the Scotch, started his own foundry, he addressed the problem of easily damaged type by coming up with what I term the Scotch Modern &ndash; the style with huge, fine serifs and tiny aperture. The brackets are so attentuated that they thin out, becoming didone-like. It was that style of type which was first termed &ldquo;modern&rdquo; in the late 19th century, not Bodoni, which had yet to be revived, and which is probably now considered most typically &ldquo;modern&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, as the distinction between Modern and Scotch rests on the degree of bracketing, the degree of &ldquo;Scotchness&rdquo; of a particular typeface may vary with both its optical size, and the foundry that produced it.</p>
<p>For instance, consider these four faces. Pretty similar, eh?
Yet De Vinne is generally considered a Modern, Georgia and Century Scotch, and Clarendon a slab serif.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting… so then it&rsquo;s all about the bracket?</p>
<p>Would that make [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-modern/|Monotype Modern]] technically not a strict Modern but a Scotch Modern?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because over time, my hyper-simplified technique was to just look at the cap R, and depending on the upstroke at the end of its leg, I would make my distinction. Anything with an extreme flip (à la [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/|De Vinne]]) I labeled as Scotch and reserved <cite>Modern</cite> for the earlier French originals. I think perhaps my assumption of what was typically Scotch was what you refer to more as Scotch Modern… those exaggerated Austin-esque versions which just scream <cite>Victorian</cite>. For whatever reason, I was lumping those faces in with the sturdier, less exaggerated Scotches like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/|Miller]].</p>
<p>Perhaps my scale should look something more this this:
|Didone&mdash;-|&ndash;Modern&ndash;|&ndash;Scotch Modern&ndash;|&mdash;-Scotch|</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Is it appropriate to separate Didone from Modern?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also be curious to know where you would place something like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/zooth/|Zooth]] (for lack of a better example) – the Moderns with ridiculously large (but still unbracketed) serifs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Would that make Monotype Modern technically not a strict Modern but a Scotch Modern?</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my view, and I do think the nature of the Scotch is open to interpretation.
19th century typography generally hasn&rsquo;t been given critical respect or attention, so there is still much to be discussed and theorized.</p>
<p>Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones, in the blurb for their <a href="http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032">Chronicle,</a> consider the Scotch to be Transitional.</p>
<p>What then does that make typefaces like Century or De Vinne, with their enormous serifs and pot-hooks on a and R?
They&rsquo;re not modern, in the sense that they don&rsquo;t have the Modern&rsquo;s openness and reductive simplicity.
Aesthetically, they are between Oldstyle and Modern, but they are not transitional, as we understand that as meaning &ldquo;on the way to&rdquo;.
They follow on from the first Modern types of Didot and Bodoni, but we can&rsquo;t call them Post-Modern &ndash; too 20th century.
So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve suggested Scotch Modern as a term for this genre.</p>
