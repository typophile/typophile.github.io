  believe this typetester is really a big step forward in the right direction, it
  gives the users a whole lot more control and opportunities to test the fonts before
  purchase.\r\n\r\nOf course it wont be as sharp as a regular PDF, since the fonts
  are rasterized as images in 300 dpi, but still \u2013 finally something new in this
  area.\r\n\r\nGreat development!"

  body: "Thanks. \r\nCurrently there is a technical raeason which doesn't allow us
    to control the linespacing separately, but as soon as we work it out, we will
    include it. We would be also happy to offer really hi-res images (600 or 1200dpi)
    but it just takes too long to generate a PDF then.\r\n\r\nSo there is still a
    lot of work for us, to make it faster, to offer access to OpenType GSUB GPOS features
    and more. This is only version 1.0, as Stephen correctly points.\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n
