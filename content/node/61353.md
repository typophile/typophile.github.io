  design. The author gives it for free at his website:\r\nhttp://www.ericolebedenco.com/yellowmag.htm\r\n\r\nDownloading
  the font and looking into, I can clearly see the Times figures there. Then, for
  this limited charset and lack of proper figures, I would think that this is a student/beginner/free
  font work. But a few pointers are leading me to think that this was based on someone
  else's work. For example, the right serif on F top is slightly bigger than on E
  - to compensate the bigger counter space - but hey, no dummy would know that...\r\n\r\nCan
  you think of anything that could be the source of this?\r\n\r\nThks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture4_4128.png]"

    junk around based upon existing designs - it's extremely amateurish and poorly
    executed, and he/she's giving it away so is not going to profit from it anyway.\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "Grrrrr.\r\n\r\nI was referring to the fact that it's based upon Times, of
    course I'd be annoyed if somebody modified one of my typefaces and sold it.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact somebody did modify Gizmo and use it for Ribena packaging. Although Gizmo
    was obviously used as the basis for the new type, as it was significantly different,
    there wasn't a thing I could do about it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gizripoff_6321.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

    never even purchased one license?\r\n\r\nThey really went out of their way. The
    dirtbag illustrator actually did a decent job but GSK already knew that... he
    or she must be the in-house person in the art department used to get around site
    license fees by customizing fonts from PDFs specimens or some junk.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\r\nNick, do you really think Juicy Fresh is a modified Gizmo? To me it clearly
    doesn't look like it. They may have taken Gizmo as a model and copied the look
    and feel but it looks like it's been created from scratch, not as a modification
    of your font."

    thought 'Oh good, they've used Gizmo for that packaging' it's only on a close
    inspection comparison that the differences become apparent. But as you say the
    look and feel are similar, and it's too close for my liking.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
