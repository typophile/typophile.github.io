  project. He evaluated viewers\u2019 responses to eight fonts \u2013 four [[sans
  serif|sans]] and four [[serif|serifs]] \u2013 at simulated road sign distances.
  The font size was chosen to be just legible for the average person at ten feet,
  the test distance.\r\n\r\nThe results \u2013 from most to least legible: [[Highway
  Gothic]], [[P22 Underground]], [[Verdana]], then [[Arial]], [[Times New Roman]],
  \ and [[Georgia]]  - all roughly equal, then [[Palatino]], and last was [[Goudy
  Oldstyle]].\r\n\r\n[[point size|Point sizes]] were adjusted so that [[cap height|cap
  heights]] of the different faces were equal. Test text (half all caps, half sentence
  case) was a shortened version of the \u201CJaded zombies\u201D [[pangram]] with
  some numbers added.\r\n\r\nHis conclusions \u2013 sign makers know what they are
  doing, sans is best for signage, [[x-height]] is important. Hardly groundbreaking,
  but his methods apparently were sound. Yeah, I helped."

      a little much to hope that typographic education will ever become general. \r\n\r\nAn
      aside: My wife's an English teacher. I wonder sometimes if her students who
      have limited interest in reading or slight learning disabilities might be harmed
      by poor typography - can bad type and arrangement make an already difficult
      task almost impossible for them?"

  body: That's really cool. It's important that these things be constantly tested,
    because they could, or can, or do, change. Is Highway Gothic most legible because
    that's what people are used to? Great stuff.

  body: With regards to the british road sign system, I'm sure in the process that
    lead up to the choice of a sans font, a serif actually came out marginally ahead
    in the various tests. The serif was designed by david kingersley (sp?) -- an apprentice
    of eric gill

  body: it never hit the road, apart from in test situations -- ie cars approaching
    at varying speeds, with varying point sizes etc. I'm pretty sure it was well tested.
    It had as I remember it a few interesting little features that distinguished certain
    similar characters from one another. It was quite charming actually in a quirky
    kind of way -- quirky not being very road friendly!

    it seems like they made the right decision. the kindersley design feels very dated,
    but considering the prominence of signage in our visual landscape, I may be conditioned
    by this to think that. the prominence of the chosen sans did make me question
    what would have happened had they gone with the serif... these things have such
    a large knock on effect '

    Kindersley's design being so) can't in fact do more good than harm.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    tests. It might be hard to get a large enough control group, there are lots of
    interesting tests you could perform with varying fonts and texts. Personally,
    I think get a bit irritated if things aren't legible, so that might be part of
    it. "

    long periods of time. Sub-optimal design might not\r\npresent an obvious and immediate
    impediment to reading, but it slowly\r\nwears away at a reader's stamina and patience;
    and once in a while,\r\nthere will be a <cite>snap</cite> - and then yes, you
