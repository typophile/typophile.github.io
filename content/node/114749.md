  body: 'Couldn''t find a font that matches perfectly all earmarks at the same time
    (digits, /M centre vertex pointy and above baseline, blunt corners /O and /R,
    counters with blunt corners and /R vertical leg). Don''s suggestion of Industry
    might the easiest to customize. I''d like to add [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/gaz|Gaz]],
    possibly the closest without matching perfectly. More: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/rodchenko-constructed-ml|Rodchenko

  body: "I like the term \"stovepipe sign lettering style\" used by Typodermic to
    describe Gaz and and Letterhead to describe Union Thug. Good category for grouping
    similar fonts.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/45DegreeElbow_4747.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/90DegreeElbow_4135.jpg]\r\nLettertype
