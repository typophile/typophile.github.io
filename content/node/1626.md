  <BR> <BR>I kind of like it... I like the squareish loopy bits on the capitals, and
  the chunky bowls on the lowercase letters, and the triangular ends of the c and
  k. <BR> <BR>Can anyone tell me if whoever did this did it on purpose, or if it&#39;s
  just an old font back from when you couldn&#39;t do so much with them? <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
  just called ScriptC on my computer, and there&#39;s not much interesting information
  if I open it up in my Fonts control panel. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Brian'
