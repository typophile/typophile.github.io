  logos for Quantum skateboard bearings. The logo should reflect the technological
  breakthroughs in bearing design that my pseudo company is making. The one on the
  left has some centering problems, but i am still happier with that one. I like the
  concept of the one on the right, but somethings off. Critiques PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo1-typofile_5107.jpg]"

  body: "The \"um\" ligature does not work for me at all.\r\n\r\nI like the mark on
    the left, although something seems off in the centre. Maybe it's the way the white
    circle is just \"punched out\" of the 'q's. I'd like to see something that flows
    a little nicer in the centre of the symbol.\r\n\r\nI'd also make the type in the
    left logo much larger - it looks too small in proportion to the darkness of the
    mark. Maybe bring the mark down to the left of the type.\r\n\r\nWatch your curves
    in the right-hand logo where the base of the 'q' becomes the 'b'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "In the left mark you've got a q form that looks much more like a 6 or a 9.
    Also, repeating and rotating a character has been done so often, that it looks
    like an obvious and uninteresting choice. (Sure, you could talk me into a bearing
    company being the most logical company where you could pursue that... but here
    it's lost its spark.)\r\n\r\nIn the right mark, you've got a letterform with a
    traditional cut (the cuts where the circlular shape meets the stem of the q) mashed
    up with a modern cut (a b with a very uniform bowl). That's why it's not working,
    in addition to the other reason mentioned. Despite the problems, I think the one
    on the right has more potential to be interesting, because of its asymmetry. Just
    decide if it's going to lose or hang on to recognizable and traditional letter
    shapes or whether it's going to be more modern. \r\n\r\nAnd Ratbaggy, you have
    the coolest avatar icon I've seen in a long time. Nice."

  body: "You lost the asymmetry on the far right. I like how the middle is saying
    skateboard wheel and bearing, with its circuler-ness. Have you played with a UC
    Q reversed out?      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething beautiful and something ugly almost
    always works."

    Q, inside the black \"Wheel\" Actually I might just go with that and leave the
    b out of it altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething beautiful and something ugly

  body: i tried the uppercase Q like that already and all i heard from the class was
    how much it looked like the target logo. i didn't have the Futura xbd but i tried
    to recreate it. thanks you so much for all the help so far. your thoughts on these?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2-typophile_5639.jpg]

  body: "In the top right example, make the center black circle a black hex with no
    white circle reversed and your outer black circle 20-25% heavier and that will
    make it feel more like a skateboard wheel and less like a target logo done. I
    think that will be a beautifully simple solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething beautiful
    and something ugly almost always works."

    brand and think like it was mentioned before, in the Top the right one, and in
    the middle the one in the middle are the ones i would keep working on. But the
    logotype is definitely on a good way..."
