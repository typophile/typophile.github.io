  prime marks. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anyone has made a list of serif fonts with
  decent prime marks?\r\n\r\nSo far I've tried Californian Pro, Palatino, Times...
  even Sim Hei Regular. Nothing seems to complement Electra. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n

  body: "Have you looked at Pi fonts such as Universal News with Commercial Pi or
    Universal Greek with Math Pi which were originally from Linotype? Both have standardized
    prime marks such as you seek. During the days of commercial typesetting they were
    the standard that just about every commercial shop used with every different type
    style.\r\n\r\nYou may already have either of those or a similar Pi font which
    has prime marks on your system. Check them out."

  body: "Thanks! I did look at some of the pi fonts, but ones like you mention and
    ones like Symbol have prime marks that really don't fit well with a transitional
    roman... at least not Electra.  \r\n\r\nI've managed to find TWO fonts that may
    work, neither of which I own, Arno Pro and Lapis Pro. \r\n\r\nI'll have to keep
    looking... "
