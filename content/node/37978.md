  if it is a custom typeface? I'm thinking it is similar to engraver's gothic? \r\n\r\nIf
  you know, is there anywhere I can get it, or something similar without costs? Or
  if not, where to purchase it for a decent price? \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nCat "

    Gothic</a>, Cat.\r\n\r\nAs for your other questions, I think that 24 bucks is
    a pretty decent price for a good typeface."
