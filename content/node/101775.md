body: "Hi everybody,\r\nI'm currently struggling with the following problem - I have
  ultra light, regular and ultra bold and want to interpolate them in Fontlab  MM
  space, so I could create an extensive family. As it seems, Fontlab MM space does
  not allow for the use of intermediate design (Normal) to be place between the two
  masters - ultra light + ultra black. (or am I mistaken?) \r\n\r\nSo that leaves
  me with two choices:\r\n1) to keep two MM files with light - normal and normal -
  black interpolations and constantly troubling about consistency\r\nor 2) use two
  weight axis in same MM font and do mind-bending slider-switching so I could achieve
  tri-master interpolation in four-master space ?!?\r\n\r\nThe discussed type family
  is still in design stage and  I have developed a habit to work/design in MM space,
  so what should I do... anyone wiling to share some experience, workaround or ..
  call it trick... how tri-master interpolation could be made possible in Fontlab?\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!\r\n"

  body: You can use four masters and ignore one of them, being careful to only interpolate
    along a single axis at a time between light and regular, and regular and bold.
    Tricky, but it works. This is why things like Superpolator were created, which
    can handle masters placed arbitrarily in a design space. Glyphs also has some
    ability to handle intermediate masters.

  body: Blend fonts is a one shot deal, working from two source fonts. You need to
    re-blend whenever you make a change to one of the source fonts to see what effect
    it has. The MM facility in FL is "live" so you can see what happens with the interpolation
    while you're editing your masters. It's more interactive.
