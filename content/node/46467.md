  my record label.\r\n\r\nI find it surprisingly difficult to find a run down of printing
  techniques online...\r\n\r\nany help on the best possible way to print a few hundreds
  of A2(roughly - that could change) sized poster ?\r\n\r\n\r\nthe actual poster would
  be a full color image with blocks of type.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For full color on a poster of that size you basically have two options, offset
    litho (printing press) and inkjet prints.  Offset printing presses are huge machines
    transfer wet opaque inks onto paper via an etched metal plate.  They require a
    great degree of skill to setup and run, thus tend to be expensive for low quantities.
    \ There are thousands of 4-color offset printers out there, so you just need to
    call around and get prices.  Keep in mind the factors that go into an offset job:
    \ paper, print quality, and finish (they can varnish the pages to provide a better
    finish and UV protection) when you are shopping around.  Several of the low cost
    printing websites tend to restrict you to lower quality options in order to provide
    the minimum price.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf offset printing is not practical, for a poster
    of that size you have one other option, oversize inkjet prints. These printers
    are basically sheet fed versions of what you use at home.  Just like your home
    printer the prints from these machines will be expensive, especially considering
    that they normally must be trimmed by hand.   If you are printing more than 10
    posters, it is probably going to get expensive fast.\r\n"
