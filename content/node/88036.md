  body: "\"I just need help supporting my choice\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, stating \"some
    people on the internet liked X\" probably isn't going to win over the stakeholders.\r\n\r\nIn
    general, designers want it smaller, marketing wants it bigger. Given the very
    limited amount of info, I'd say if the cover, overall, emphasizes the visual brand,
    go smaller. If it's generic and the logo is the only thing to identify the company,
    bigger might be the only option. "

  body: "I understand the desire to maintain your client's privacy, but you can't
    judge the best size for a logo by looking a generic placeholder. Logos vary considerably
    in their proportions, boldness, etc. \r\n\r\nBut as a general comment, it's usually
    not a good idea to put a logo over a patterned background, like in layouts C and
    D.  In fact most corporate identity manuals specifically prohibit it. "
