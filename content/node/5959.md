  <BR> <BR>Specifically &#34;Pearl River Delta&#34;. I&#39;ve seen it around but not
  enough to figure it out.

    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-conduit/conduit-itc-bold">ITC
    Conduit</a>. Not sure yet about &#34;Pearl River Delta.&#34; The two seem different
    to me.

  body: I know why you love Cachet, Hrant. It&#39;s the genius of  <BR>Dave Farey,
    and woefully underpromoted. <BR> <BR>BTW, I was working. I do that sometimes ...
    kind of.

  body: Yep, Cachet is it. Underrated and not promoted for sure. Why don&#39;t more
    people use this face? Oh wait, because they can&#39;t find it! I own the book
    in question and I&#39;ve always admired the face. Thanks for the speedy detective
    work.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen J. Abbot Miller use this face before but couldn&#39;t
    figure it out. Of the New York hot shots, his type tastes are a little more evolved
    than most. He did after all design the premiere issue of the ill fated ONE using
    all Eureka. He&#39;s scores a few points for that.

    thought its readability is low, but they -stupidly- didn&#39;t realize that it&#39;s
    just the loose letterspacing: negative-track it a bit, and it becomes the solid
    text face it was intended to be. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    fall in love with it, they are frusterated by its lack of  <BR>italics and small
    caps. Someone close to Mr. Ferry please  <BR>encourage him to finish this fine
