  body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nThis is a new one from SIL- to me anyways.\r\n\r\nI would
    pass on that one. Andika, tho well intentioned, is not ready for the production
    environment. \r\n\r\nAnd besides its a sans which might not be the best choice
    for a book. Century School is my all time favorite for this... it\u2019s old,
    I know.\r\n\r\nThere are fonts just for younger readers... I don\u2019t very much
    about this genre tho. Hopefully someone else will chime in.\r\n\r\nIf you like
    the mood of Andika, Miramonte from Ascender has a similar feel but it does not
    have Andika\u2019s special features. Miramonte does have a two-story a which increases
    cognition.\r\n\r\nYou can get it here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontmarketplace.com/font/miramonte-pro-family.aspx/292\r\n\r\nMikey

    it!\r\n\r\nMike, I wonder why you say Andika is not ready for a production environment?"

  body: "Kerning and a general lack of polish. Also, it looks too dificult to program
    to get all those nice features it has in one sentance. D Series for the two storey
    a and g, then if you want a defined q that's another series. Not fun to work with
    in a book.\r\n\r\nBut like what is saying\u2014if you like\u2014go for it.\r\n\r\nMikey
    :-)\r\n\r\nPS... Paul what are infant types? ... are these for young readers?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=438582&grab_id=0&page_id=46149&query=infant&SCOPE=Fonts\r\n\r\n\r\n"
