body: Pistilli Roman was digitalised by Castcraft in their OPTI font range as OPTI
  Pirogi Roman which is now difficult to find. More recently, I have found a moderately
  good example of this font in the GST &#40;GreenStreet&#41; 500 Elegant Fonts range
  hiding under the name Galeere. It&#39;s not perfect and it doesn&#39;t have the
  alt flowery ampersand. Shame.

  body: '&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62;Well, as a new member to your postings I was interested
    to see that, like &#62;me, a couple of your members were searching for a digitalised
    version of &#62;Pistilli Roman. As they obviously had not been able to find a
    copy, I &#62;thought that my two references might be helpful. <BR> <BR>Do I detect
    a note of aggression in your &#34;And&#34;?'

  body: I created a digital Pistilli Roman for Glamour magazine years ago &#40;with
    the classic ampersand&#41;. I know of at least one other designer who has also
    created a digital version of the font &#40;custom for a particular client&#41;.
    I&#39;ve tried, years ago, to contact Pistilli but to no avail. I wonder if he
    is still alive.

  body: In 1969, Phil Martin &#40;Alphabet Innovations&#41; did a Pistilli Roman look-alike
    with tons of swash and alternate characters called Didoni. <a href="http://www.roostertypes.com/view_fullfont.asp?catalogid=3192&amp;issingle=yes"
    target="_blank">Didoni is available from Red Rooster</a>, but, unfortunately,
    when it was digitized, the extra characters &#40;including the fancy ampersand&#41;
    were left out.
