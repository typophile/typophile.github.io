  body: "great. thanks. :)\r\n\r\nfor anyone who is interested, there is a version
    closer to the bitmap (called MPW) that is \"essentially a straight conversion
    of the bitmap font into an outline font with the addition of some of the same
    disambiguation features as were added to the TrueType Monaco.\" (wikipedia)\r\n\r\nlink
    for download via apple.com is <a href=\"ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./Miscellaneous/MPW_Font.sit.hqx\">here</a>\r\n\r\nit
    is a little heavier though than the sample earlier in thread.\r\n\r\n\r\nX___c_coy____"
