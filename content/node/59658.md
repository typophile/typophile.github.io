body: I am fairly new to digital printing. I have been getting by with an old tower
  with Windows XP and Microsoft Word 2003. But I have some money saved up and am looking
  to buy a laptop, that would possibly come equipped with what Id need to make books.
  I do not know much about Macs but I would be willing to try it. I am unfamiliar
  with publishing programs, and was also wondering if there are any computer packages
  available out there that come equipped with the best software for publishing and
  design. I can spend about $3000. Thank you all for any help you can give.

  body: '"Book making" seems an odd phrase. Are you a writer, an editor or a book
    designer? And what type of books?'

  body: "Books that are less text-heavy (cookery books, travel guides, etc) are often
    designed with either a \"Desktop Publishing\" (DTP) layout program, like <a href=\"http://www.scribus.net\">Scribus</a>
    (free, and zero price) or InDesign or Quark (proprietary, and expensive).\r\n\r\nBooks
    that are very text-heavy (novels, academic texts) are also designed with a \"typesetting\"
    program, like <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX\">LaTeX</a> (or its
    less book-focused cousin, <a href=\"http://wiki.contextgarden.net/What_is_ConTeXt\">ConTeXt</a>.)
    LaTeX is especially good at typesetting mathematics and other scientific literature.\r\n\r\nThe
    excellent <a href=\"http://www.withouthotair.com/\">Without Hot Air</a> book (available
    to download in full at no cost) was designed by the author with LaTeX and nicely
    shows off what it can do."

  body: For bookbinding you'll need at the minimum a saddle stapler. I have a very
    small Bostitch B8SB. I suppose I could use it on my lap but it would be much more
    comfortable on a desktop.

  body: "I've been working on Macs using DTP setups since 1984, and I love my current
    setup. While they've changed the MacBook Pro configuration to the point that I
    don't think I'd like the newer models being offered, I have a 15\" MacBookPro2,2,
    Intel Duo Core. It only came with 1 gig of RAM, but I doubled that for $30 USD
    (including shipping). I'm running CS3, use FontExplorer for font management, and
    among many other things have Parallels running Windows XP.\r\n\r\nIt's a very
    steep learning curve if you haven't used it, but Adobe CS3 is the gold standard
    for DTP work \u2014 InDesign for page layout with Photoshop for image editing
    and Illustrator for vector tweaking. Well worth the investment in the long run
    for anyone in the DTP business.\r\n\r\nAlso, and very importantly, I rarely use
    my laptop as a laptop. I use it with a mouse, and external keyboard and monitor,
    meaning I use it the way a tower is used. From what I've seen this is the current
    trend since the price and expandability of laptops has gotten much better. It
    offers the best of both worlds. I use is as a desktop computer, but can unplug
    it and be free of my desk any time I want."
