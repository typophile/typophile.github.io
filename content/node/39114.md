  Nacional Digital</a> page today. What's so interesting about it? Check out the <a
  href=\"http://purl.pt/index/geral/news/PT/indexOD.html\">list of recent digitized
  books</a>, and I'm quite sure you'll be as hyped as I am now. I mean, look at these
  beauties <a href=\"http://purl.pt/index/geral/date/PT/1685.html\">from 1685</a>,
  for example. And this stuff seems to be available for free download in PDF format
  or <a href=\"http://purl.pt/170/1/P52.html\">JPG files</a>!!!\r\n\r\nHere's another
  pearl: <a href=\"http://purl.pt/107\">Nova Escola para aprender a ler, escrever,
  e contar</a>. This book is where [[Dino dos Santos]] got his inspiration for <a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/andrade-pro/\">Andrade</a>.\r\n\r\nI
  hope the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafra_National_Palace#Library\">Library
  of Mafra National Palace</a> decides to digitize its contents as well..."

    Right now I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t speak Portugese; otherwise I might not sleep
    for a week!"

  body: This is the sort of work that is inspiring. I think it is well worth it to
    digitally archive these books and manuscripts as time is destroying them. Add
    to that, that not all of us are lucky enough to get over there to begin with.
    That said, when we were at Mafra the library was amazing and it was sad that we
    couldn't walk down the great hall. (I'll have to post a picture to Flickr now.)
