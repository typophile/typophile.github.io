  body: "Hi. \r\n\r\nPreliminary response.\r\n\r\nI like the bug. Not sure what you
    want critiqued? Type? Layout? Really hard to read the text from the pic so I'm
    not sure what this is about. A bit important if you are looking for design suggestions.\r\n\r\nSort
    of a detective novel?\r\n\r\nLayout is basically ok. The title page is quite weak.
    Stick with the Myriad that you have running through the rest of it rather than
    that stick-like type, somewhat off. Oh, and dump the chick and put your photo
    there instead, wow.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    body: "The \"stick\" type is from the cover. I'll post a sample of that here so
      you can see why I used that.\r\nHere's how the book is being promoted on our
      website at the moment:\r\n\"John Gilmore's CRAZY STREAK is the most controversial
      novel to appear on the American literary scene since Nabokov's LOLITA. Here
      is a twisted\r\nexcursion into seething sexuality, desperate alienation, incest
      and\r\nconscienceless violence, plunging the reader way, way over the edge.\"\r\n\r\nCrap..
      I can't attatch images to comments? And no HTML for images?!?\r\n\r\nWell, check
      out http://www.scapegoatpublishing.com/johngilmore.htm for a cover.\r\n"

  body: Kevin loose the justified type. Make it all rag right. Its just easier to
    read and since you have a lot of conversation it lends itself to rag right type
    anyway. Also it would read better if you could increase the leading by a point.
    All the text seems to be running into each other. The purpose of the typesetting
    should be that it isn't noticed, only the content of the work.

  body: "The size decreasing type on the chapter beginning has a very open spacing
    between words in the big sizes, use hypentation or ragged paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a clean setting, but maybe the face is a bit dull.\r\n\r\nOverall it's fine.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "I'd like to congratulate you for hanging the double quotes at the start of
    a line, but you will need to carefully check that it is all done \u2013 on 0002
    line 7 I spotted one that wasn't, for example. Have you seen your bugs printed
    using the same process as the rest of the book I suspect they will fill in, they
    also aren't sitting comfortably in their space. The chapter numbers are too heavy.
    The decreasing point size will need a careful approach that ultimately might not
    be worth the effort. I have to agree with H\xE9ctor that the font might be too
    dull.\r\nSorry to be mostly negative.\r\nTim"

    the 'protocol' for hanging quotes? a couple of my tutors were emphatic that all
    quote marks at the beginning of lines should be hanging, whereas the technicians
    in the print room were rather dubious and said it looked bloody awful. not to
    menion the fact that inDesign seems to have no automatic function for turning
    them on and off?\r\nI had a look through some of my books and none of them seemed
    to have hanging quotes..."

  body: "I suppose the best answer to that is to say try it, select a passage that
    combines speech with non-speech and see what you think. If you are doing your
    setting using style sheets then instead of creating one that has the indent you
    have chosen create two one with the standard indent and one with slightly less
    to compensate for the width of a double quote, if you decide that the hanging
    doesn't work it is easy enough to edit the style sheet.\r\nThe reason I congratulated
    the poster is that I find the ragged indent caused by double quotes is distracting
    when I read. You might decide that you prefer it without. Technicians, if they
    are like the ones I had at college, often have their views because that is the
    way they have been doing things since their apprentice days that doesn't necessarily
    mean they are wrong but it could be that the technology didn't exist (or was more
    difficult to implement) when the views were formed.\r\nTim"

    already. I'd made a few changes based on early comments, but most of the comments
    came too late.\r\nI'll post revisions if anyone is interested."
