body: "This project is just in the beginning stages. It's for my brother in law so
  it's not anything that's on a time limit, it's just something I've began and I'm
  having fun with.\r\n\r\nHe's a commercial real estate appraiser who works for himself.
  Basically this logo would only be for letterhead, business cards and a cover sheet
  for the actual appraisals themselves. \r\n\r\nHis initials are e and g. He said
  he'd like to keep his name in it instead of adding an abstract shape. So I'm playing
  with his initials to create a shape. I like the way the lower case e and upper case
  G were essentially the same shape when mirrored. \r\n\r\nObviously number 1 is just
  getting the letters on there and the rest were taken from there.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  have any thoughts? \r\n\r\nA tagline will be added below with the full company name,
  but I'm not there yet. "

    good. But the rest seem forced. Have you tried a serif font? You might get some
    interesting interaction between letter forms. '

    first thing I thought of was to look at using the tail from a double storey g
    and attach it to the e to make a ligature."

    really thinking the best thing for this isn't going to be capital sans-serifs,
    but lowercase old-style letters, like garamond or caslon, but play with them a
    little bit\u2026"

  body: '"E" and "G". You sketch #1 you have a e and G. Why not try two Gs, one of
    them flipped horizontally, it would look like a E. Just a thought.'

  body: "Yes, I immediately thought Chanel when I looked at these.  These treatments
    feel too \"luxe\" to me, and don't seem to fit \"commercial real estate appraiser.\"
    \ I'm just playing free-association and throwing out some concepts I would like
    to see expressed in a new direction: business, confident, informed, value, industrial,
    serious, etc.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Thanks everyone. Like I said these were just beginning. I appreciate it.
    \r\n\r\nI haven't had time, or needed to go back to these because my sister and
    he just had a baby. \r\n\r\nI still feel like I have something with number 5.
    I feel like it's the most structured. You're right Nick about some of them not
    feeling like \u201Ccommercial real estate appraiser.\u201D \r\n\r\n\r\n"
