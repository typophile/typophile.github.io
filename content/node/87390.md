  some similarities to the Mostra font family but it definitely isn't Mostra itself.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nImage here: \r\n\r\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/1058/fotosy.jpg"

  body: Given the age of the sample and the differences between the 2 As and 2 Ds
    I'd say hand-lettered.

    as it is quite a recent \"remake\" of the original art nouveau font, it's a bit
    skewed because of my cellphone's camera, here's the original photograph:\r\n\r\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/9195/foto2pcv.jpg\r\n\r\n@ryuk:
    the A's certainly seem to match up.\r\n\r\ncould it also be a mixture of fonts?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: Ah, when you wrote 1920/30s Cinema Font I assumed that referred to the age
    of the sample.

  body: the cinema is from the 20/30s and I think they definitely got the inspiration
    from the original logo, sorry for the missunderstanding.

    sans), I\u2019d say it\u2019s a custom logo job."

  body: '@riccard0 thanks for the hint, I''m leaning towards this assumption as well,
    especially because some of these letters seem to be from different fonts... the
    S looks very much like Mostra Two, whereas others like the A are certainly not
    from the same family...'

    is no longer a required skill for designers now that we have 3 zillion fonts to
    choose from, but there are still some folks who are good at it. The fact that
    something was created recently doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of
    its being handlettered."
