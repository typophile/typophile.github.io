    contemporary sans faces, for the most part, pay even less allegiance, only a passing
    nod, to the Trajan models. IMHO\r\n\r\nIn your eg. above there is definitely little
    semblance to the Trajan. Well, the \"I\" is spot on.\r\n\r\nPreparing for the

  body: "Hi Michael\r\n\r\nI neglected to include a reference to my [[http://typophile.com/node/49471|earlier
    blog post]] which explained the context a little more - this was an experiment
    following the geometry of the boundaries of those classical letters as measured
    by Tom Perkins in the article I mentioned there. As an example, he's convinced
    that one of the main geometries determining classical letter widths is the root
    five rectangle, (1:sqrt(5)). The B fits into one, the C into two, etc. So I created
    some guides along those lines and then drew a basic sans letter within them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Interesting. I think it can be seen that the Trajan & Appian inscriptions
    were freely brushed onto the stone before carving which would result in some accidentals
    and that the carving would add other accidentals to the letter shapes and proportions.
    However it is also clear that some form of detailed panning and marking out would
    have/did take place. Sign writers and letter carvers today who remain true to
    their craft do likewise and mark out their layouts using chalk or pencil to establish
    guides as to letter widths and spacing before freely brushing the letter forms.
    Some variants in letter shape and proportion must occur.\r\nMy thoughts tend to
    favour that these inspriptions were carried out my competent craftsmen who were
    well versed in the tools, history and disciplines of their trade. A competent
    letterer does not need or use geometry in application for the intrinsic characteristics
    of shape and proportion are ingrained and felt rather than measured.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said this I do think that the proportions of classic roman letters can be shown
    to have some reference to mathematics & geometry. However I don't think that the
    inscriptions sited above were drawn with geometry before carving, these are letters
    constructed by craftsmen and not by mathematicians.\r\nI for one would be interested
    in the detail of your study into the geometry of these inscriptions because classical
    roman letter forms remain very much a passion of mine.\r\n\r\nI agree with Michael
    the sample shown has little semblance to the Trajan or the Appian inscription,
    but it is too small to really tell."

    however it is also important to consider his conclusions and also his reference
    to Rudolph Arnheim - very important.

  body: "\"Hey Graham, who is Arnheim, \"\r\n\r\nHe was a professor of phycology as
    you probably have found out by now, who was into the arts and the creative thinking
    process. Perkins makes reference to his essay titled \"A Review of Proportion\"
    in which he agues that proportion is relevant and appears in the things that display
    or show it. He identifies the proportions that make an ideal oak leaf which are
    not exemplified in any single oak leaf but every oak leaf contains elements of
    the ideal. I believe Perkins is saying that although it is widely accepted that
    the Trajan and Appian Way inscriptions represent the \"ideal\" roman letter the
    ideal proportions are nor exemplified in a single inscription nor in a single
    example, but rather demonstrated and contained in a variety of examples. Trajan
    and Appian show broad ranging changes to the \"ideal\" within themselves and you
    can see these changes as you look carefully at each line of text. Subtle and not
    so subtle changes appear in each line and from left to right as the craftsman
    makes changes to shape and proportions to fit the letters into the inscription.
    \r\nMy thoughts are that the ideal proportion of the letter forms in these inscriptions
    were not demonstrated in any geometric drawing but rather are the result of knowledge
    gained from familiarity and knowledge acquired through doing and making. A simple
    example much loved by philosophers is the smell of coffee. The only way one gets
    to know what coffee smells like is to smell it. No amount of description or scientific
    mathematics can give someone and understanding of what it is to experience the
    smell of roast coffee. Similarly the only way to gain the knowledge of what is
    ideal proportion for lettering is to make letters in a practical application.
    \r\nAny references to the underlying geometrical proportion of the ideal form
    are long forgotten by the skilled letterer as they become ingrained as a part
    of the process of making good letters and arranging them well.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for sending the PDF Graham. I will read it today. And for the heads
    up on Arnheim.\r\n\r\nCraig... I think one reason the P and R looked odd is that
    the interior of the bowl should align with the edge of the grid. Instead in the
    work above the whole bowl falls inside making the letters too narrow. There are
    several other characters that need to be nuanced width wise. You will notice in
    Tom's eg. the M violates the width by almost a whole stroke width... etc.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "You're right about the P and R bowl - thanks for pointing me to that mistake.\r\n\r\nThanks
    to both of you for the comments, too.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I maybe should repeat
    that this is just an exercise I see as a starting point for thinking about cap
    proportions. It has already been useful for me in realizing the variation of those
    classical cap widths. But I'm not under the impression that those exact geometric
    rules (whether or not you believe in their determination of the old inscribed
    examples) will have a special rightness for a monoline sans letter anyway.\r\n\r\nI
    got the Perkins article, by the way, from the book entitled <em>Font</em> featuring
    Sumner Stone and published by the Ditchling Museum in 2000. It's the same as the
    pdf that google turns up, but there's an additional page that shows two letters
    of a typeface under development based on the Appian letters and the geometry traced
    in the article. And it ends like this: \r\n\r\n\"One last curious fact. Catich
    gives the size of the piece of marble on which the Trajan inscription is incised
    as 4 feet 5 3/4 inches high by 10 feet wide. This turns out to be a root five
    rectangle. Can this be purely coincidental?\""

  body: Its looking better Craig. You may need to adjust the L as well, its a little
    narrow compared to the inscriptions. Mono line sans or not, it is looking better
    than most sans already. Keep working on it. You may also find you will have to
    play with spacing. Good work.
