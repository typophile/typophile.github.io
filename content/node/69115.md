  body: 'You haven''t been forgotten: it''s just likely that this is not a standard
    typeface, but simply something someone at Austin-Healey hand-cut for silkscreening
    on the gauge. When I saw it, I immediately thought of Radiant, manually expanded,
    but it''s not nearly close enough a match...'
