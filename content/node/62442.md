  tends to be quite narrow compared with the arts.\r\n\r\nIn that field, I observed
  that when arts professionals were confronted with papers written by scientists,
  they would squint and the page and then reject it without finishing a sentence.
  I thought artists were just stupid and unable to analyse either abstract or concrete
  subject matter.\r\n\r\nHowever, when my career switched the arts a few years ago,
  and I experienced the inverse difficulty and its not the content. Rather, it is
  a fault of the type.\r\n\r\nFor example, [[http://blog.graydesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/semiotics_paper_rev2.pdf|this
  paper]] on graphic design has huge line spacing and its nearly impossible for me
  to read. Specifically, as my eyes scan across the words, my line of sight drops
  into the void below the text. This creates a pause at random intervals along the
  lines.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when I reach the end of one line and attempt the read
  the start of the next line - my eyes instinctively search the empty space between
  these wide separated lines!\r\n\r\nI conjecture that all of the difficulties described
  above stem from learned convention rather than any disability of artists or scientists.\r\n\r\nMy
  career now spans the domains of art and science, and line spacing in my own work
  has become a serious concern because my audience may include both scientists and
  artists. Does typography offer a clever solution to a ridiculous situation?\r\n\r\nPercy
  Snow, author of Two Cultures, would be laughing."

  body: "This is interesting. One question, though: are you talking about <em>manuscripts</em>
    or <em>any kind</em> of publication, such as journal articles? \r\n\r\nThis, because
    I'm surprised that your Arts readers would be repelled by single spacing, since
    it's what you find in all printed publications, including newspapers, magazines
    and almost all books, as well as on computers, whether in emails or on the web.
    \r\n\r\nIn my field, linguistics, anything in print will always be single spaced,
    whether it appears in a book or a journal article. However, there is some variation
    in manuscripts. It's true that most recently, word-processed manuscripts tend
    to be single-spaced; however, in the days of typewriter manuscripts and the early
    days of computer-printed manuscripts up to the mid- and late-1980s, double spacing
    tended to improve legibility and for that reason was preferred. Many old typescripts
    and published theses I have from that era are double-spaced. However, this is
    no longer the case for those from the digital word processing era. \r\n\r\nOne
    more thing about manuscripts: most editors I have dealt with require manuscripts
    to be submitted with double spacing for practical reasons: the extra space simplifies
    the job of mark-up for reviewers and proof-readers and for those down the line
    who need to read the mark-up and make the specified changes. "

  body: "Kiwehtin,\r\n\r\nThank you for highlighting the historical context! :) My
    example regards internal publications (and collaborative drafts) at some of the
    older institutions. I wonder if their current rules on formatting are retained
    for posterity, or if they are a necessity stemming from learned convention. For
    example, I assume that someone reads an institution's archived knowledge.\r\n\r\nAs
    you rightly point out, how do they read public works? To be frank, I do not think
    they can as at least one professor argues \"they are all the same\" :)\r\n\r\nPublishingMojo,\r\n\r\nAs
    it happens, (art/humanities) undergraduate and postgraduate dissertations lose
    marks for using single space. Those submissions will be published in the previously
    mentioned archives - thereby presenting the problem to the next generation of
    arts academics :)"

    agree but that does not stop those in control of university thesis regulations

    University which had a similar very open spacing requirement. I was in the Visual
    Communication Department and it drove us all crazy. The official bound copy for
    the library submission had to be triple spaced! Several design graduate students
    made 2 different copies--one was the \"official\" one that went to the dean and
    all the bureaucrats and the other was designed in a much more visually respectable
    manner. The 2nd one was the one everyone else preferred :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Many non-fiction publishers require that manuscripts be submitted in a specific
    format -- APA or MLA -- and a specific font. By these means, manuscript page count
    can easily be used to gauge formatted output. I recall the first publication I
    worked for had all the in-house typewriters locked down with a 42 character column
    and triple space so the editor could grab a handful of MS sheets and say, 'this
    is a half-column over, cut it.'\r\n"

    However, that was not my concern.\r\n\r\nSubmission guidelines in the Arts are
    not dictated by an instructor. They are define by school regulations, and are
    typically double spaced or more. There are two reasons why this cannot be for
    the purposes of hand written corrections. First, similar rules require that instructors
    write on a separate sheet. Second, the submission is retained for published archives
    that must not be written on. The spacing requirement is equal to a border requirement.\r\n\r\nIn
    contrast, university submission guidelines in the Sciences typically require less
    spacing. However, I dug out my first degree dissertation and the total border
    is equal to the total line length. In that case, the layout was dictated by my
    university's LaTeX template."
