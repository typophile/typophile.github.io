body: I am doing a book on david hockney and am in the process of selecting a text
  face. What faces would help me compliment his art and at the same time be readable?
  Thanks. <BR> <BR>So far im playing with proforma, eldeticneo, serifa, and scala
  sans.

  body: What is David Hockney about? <BR>What is the target demographic/usage of the
    book? <BR>What&#39;s the format? Length, page size, paper stock, illustration
    ratio, etc. <BR>How important is readability versus aesthetic expression? <BR>
    <BR>BTW, of those four Serifa and Scala Sans have inadequate readability &#40;for
    book-length work&#41;; Proforma could work if the point size is big enough or
    the paper a bit rough; and Eidetic is mannered but functional. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'the book is basically a retrospective on the work of hockney... one of the
    most famous pop artists. the book will be square.. 8.75&#34; in each direction.
    About 64 pages and the illustraion to text ratio will be about 30% tops favoring
    text.  <BR> <BR>well i originally wanted to go sans serif.. but maybe serif will
    be better in the long run and allow me to match it up with a nice sans for the
    headers etc.  this is a school project that i will probably be putting in my portfolio
    and will be output on an inkjet so the face will have to be a bit forgiving. Would
    proforma do well for this book as a text face? So far it is the face I am leaning
    to. It will be used at 8, maybe 9 point. Also, what would you recommend for a
    face that will work well with it for headers? '

  body: Jason, I would lean towards a serif face to contrast with the pop art. Try
    to go at least 9pt and please have good leading and lots of white space. Art books
    are for looking at the art, not the art of the type.

  body: Daniel.. i agree.. the only thing is... this is for a class called &#34;book
    typography&#34; so I chose to make the book less about his art and more about
    his life so that I would have a little more wiggle room with type, thats why im
    pushing really hard to select some really good faces that might not be as well
    known as what the other kids are using &#40;garamond, univers, gill sans etc.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m thinking I should crack open my Indie Fonts books and find something
    to use for chapter openings/headers.

    work.

  body: It seems there isn&#39;t a huge amount of text. This means you have more leeway
    in terms of sacrificing a bit of readability. So a sans -a good one- might be
    fine, although it&#39;s not easy to find a texty sans with enough character to
    &#34;carry&#34; a book about a pop artist. Look at Quadraat Sans, or maybe some
    of Storm&#39;s fonts. <BR> <BR>Proforma will not be very happy when set small,
    since it&#39;s a bit narrow and has a modest x-height. But it&#39;s actually the
    kind of font that can support a 5% width increase, and if you choose a darkish
    weight and track it looser it might work out very well. For a companion, look
    at FB&#39;s Amplitude. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: ahh quadraat sans sets quite nicely... i just ran some tests with it. I&#39;m
    having a bit of a problem pairing it with a display face... would amplitude work
    with this one? Any other alternatives? Maybe just a bolder version of the font?
    or the serif version? I think I am overwhelming myself with possibilities, I have
    a hard time narrowing down my decisions. I love this site, Ive been spending waaaay
    too much time here <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I don&#39;t think Amplitude would work with Quadraat - you need something
    more &#34;lyrical&#34;. <BR>What about Quadraat Headliner? Its gargantuan x-height
    gives it a unique look. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
