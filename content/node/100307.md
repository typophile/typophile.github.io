  place to post this, or even if it's allowed, but I'm trying to identify a font.
  Does anyone know what font this is and/or where I could purchase it? I've looked
  at several Display and Bodoni fonts, but can't seem to match the \"i\". It's from
  the Ralph Lauren site: [[http://global.ralphlauren.com/en-us/rlmagazine/editorial/hol12/Pages/KiernanShipka.aspx?ab=int_010313_BABYLP_WIDGET_RLMAGAZINE_MEETKIERNANSHIPKA_EXPLORENOW]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much for any help.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/RLpic_5559.jpg]"
