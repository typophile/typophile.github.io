  body: It could be a separate font with its own name, but it's essentially <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frankfurter/">Frankfurter</a>
    with extra weight added.

    understand that. Me, I wish I could find a free version of the new iPhone. Or
    even better, a MacBook Pro! Wouldn't that be neat? :^P"

    creating the letterforms one bezier curve at a time, then hinting, spacing, and
    kerning them.\r\n\r\nOh, wait...\r\n\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    new to me. i am a student. who is extremely excited by the possibilities of text.
    i'm sorry that i stepped on some toes here by considering free fonts. i will do
    better. "

  body: "Hey Brent, you <em>are</em> welcome.\r\nYou just hit the sore point, I\u2019m
    afraid. There are a lot of type designers here on Typophile, and they\u2019re
    quite allergic to free fonts, you certainly can relate to that.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    there <em>are</em> free fonts \u2013 unlike free iPhones and MacBooks. Hell, there
    are a lot of Typophile type designers who give away (some of) their fonts for
    free. And there\u2019s even a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14652?\">FAQ
    on free fonts</a> in the Typophile wiki.\r\n\r\nSo \u2013 additionally considering
    that an adipose Frankfurter is not something like a genuine textface that would
    be considered as labour-intensive, requiring extensive kerning an whatsoever,
    but quite on the contrary rather a face that typically would reside in the realm
    of free fonts \u2013 I cannot understand the harsh reaction. "

    ring any bell? No need to be sorry, I just wanted to put what you said into perspective.
    What is it with those oversensitive Americans? Talking about stepping on someone's
    toes\u2026 :^D\r\n\r\nBTW I'm not at all allergic to free fonts, just to rip-offs
    of commercial fonts or stolen ones. If you are a student, maybe the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/38901\">Introductions
    to Type Design</a> on <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be\">Unzipped</a> might be
    a good start at understanding why good quality typefaces rarely are free. ;^)"
