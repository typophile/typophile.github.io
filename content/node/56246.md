  have come up with various designs that I hope will represent the software. Attached
  are samples of the logo that I have designed. I would like to get your opinions
  on what you think of them. \r\n\r\nThank you."

    choice looks ok for the type of client. Could also be greenish, since our eyes
    easiest perceive green colour.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "I agree with litera. \r\n\r\nThe one at the bottom looks most promising to
    me. Perhaps consider styling C into an iris .. though it may come out cheesy.
    I would certainly drop the reflection and use same, sans serif type for both lines.
    Also the bottom line is kerned way too tight and it looks discomforting. Also
    3 shades of blue in the way you have them is a one too many."
