  make occupational health and safety tracking software, Omni is their product. There
  will also be variations of the Omni software packages - Omni Health, Omni Safe etc.
  which will need to be dealt with.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know what you think of them
  technically, and how you think they will work as we expand the identity online and
  in print. They will be predominantly used online.\r\n\r\nThanks, I appreciate your
  help.\r\n\r\nJulian\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: To me the kerning in the Obsidium logo needs work. Obviously it is tight intentionally
    but I feel that it could be cleaned up in a few areas. For example the spacing
    before and after the last lowercase "i" should be evened out in my opinion. It
    is just so slightly off that it looks neglected. I would also do something with
    the dot on the "i" so that it either interacts more or less with the "d," the
    way it just grazes it ever so slightly bothers me. Finally, I would reconsider
    the "um" at the end, I feel the way that they overlap rather than but up next
    to one another makes it look a little awkward.

  body: "Firstly, the master brand, I'm not too sure about the selection of a typeface
    like futura for a tightly kerned logo like this. The ascenders feel unnecessarily
    tall and the round dots on the i\u2019s seem to work against what the tight kerning
    is trying to achieve. Tight kerning tends to work better with very strong and
    easily identified letter forms but to be honest I\u2019m not sure whether it works
    in the context of oh&s software. Also, considering that \u2018obsidium\u2019 is
    most likely a latin word and not one used by most people in any kind of daily
    context, I think it makes the legibility of this logo vital in the consideration
    of it\u2019s design. The fact that this logo is intended to be predominantly used
    online, makes me more concerned that the very, very tight gaps around the second
    \u2018i\u2019 will most likely blur and further reduce the legibility of this
    logo.\r\n\r\nNow to \u2018omni\u2019. The relationship between the \u2018o\u2019
    and the \u2018m\u2019 is interesting but personally I found it quite distracting,
    it looks as though it might be trying to illustrate something. Either way, it
    really places the focus on the \u2018om\u2019 and the \u2018ni\u2019 appears almost
    secondary. The kerning through the logo is once again a little uncomfortable.
    The fact that as a brand they seem to bear no real resemblance to each other raises
    some real questions, I\u2019m wondering if this is intentional?\r\n\r\nIt would
    be good to see some more development to see how the sub brands would behave in
    the overall brand structure."

  body: "OBSIDIUM:\r\nThe kerning is definitely out of wack here. Needs a lot of work.
    Good luck with the d & i! Stop stealing concepts off hair salons and vodka bottles!\r\n\r\nOMNI:\r\nIt
    looks good, 10 years ago.\r\nThis style feels a little over done these days. Remember,
    this logo is meant to last them another 5-10 years! I don't think the concept
    of joining the o & m suits this product either. Plus it's too heavy on the left
    of the logo. \r\n\r\nSorry.I like the colour though..."
