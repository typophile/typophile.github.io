  body: On page 397 of my copy of The Encyclopedia of Type Faces, by Jaspert, Berry,
    and Johnson, third edition, this is shown as Rondo Bold. It was designed by Stefan
    Schlesinger and Dick Dooijies and issued in 1948. <BR>There is a larger flourish
    on the left side of A; the artist who did the logo must have redrawn that letter.
    It&#39;s been reduced, too.
