  body: There are some symbol font locations for certain arrows which may give you
    some consistency. If you look at some of the pi and symbol encodings in FontLab,
    you can see some positioning.

  body: "Ah ha, very clever. (thanks!)\r\n\r\nBut no fair resorting to the appropriate
    unicode block.  :o) (where's the imagination?)\r\n\r\nI have noticed in a number
    of fonts designed for signage, arrows are placed in arbitrary locations, which
    normally contain glyphs that are very unlikely to be needed on a sign. I'll try
    the unicode 2190 arrows block and see how it works out but, I had always assumed
    there was a reason for replacing other glyphes with arrows instead of using the
    appropriate unicode block. \r\n\r\nin my experience, sign shops and many sign
    designers aren't all that type-savvy, and software they use can be limiting where
    type is concerned, except when it comes to fancy new ways to distort it. I want
    to place arrows where they can be found easily on any type pallet or with a simple
    key stroke combination. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    if you are targeting your arrows at signwriters, ask them what they use."

    that are in use in many sign shops. If you're targeting that market, it may be
    wise to check the requirements of those applications.\r\n\r\nFine programs that
    they are (the drawing environment of Flexi could be a successor for those who
    liked Freehand) they are very expensive and not worth the investment unless you
    need them to operate the specialized equipment that sign shops use."

  body: "Generally, I would say that using <- for the leftwards-pointing and -> for
    the rightwards-pointing arrows is a standard. For the verticals, either |^ or
    -^ makes sense. It is a matter of mnemonic. It also depends on the scope of arrows
    the font  is going to support. If you want to cover significantly more than the
    basic four or eight directions and possibly allow for smooth combination and lengthening
    of the arrows (this is something Skolar does), you need to think hard. E.g. I
    like the /^ sequence for diagonals, but I could not use it because I wanted to
    support harps (-/ sequence). Etc.\r\n\r\nOn the website mentioned above is a cheat
    sheet in PDF describing what combinations are used. It is by no means a standard,
    but as far as I know it has the widest coverage around. Best thing to let designers
    know about these things is to put it in a specimen.\r\n\r\nAlso, these features
    are usually placed in stylistic set (any you choose) and/or discretionary ligatures
    (dlig). The latter is to allow support in Illustrator which did not support stylistic
    sets in CS\u2013CS3."

    At least for games. But seriously, unicode is your frieeend.
