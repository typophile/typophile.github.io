body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to add pieces to my portfolio but I don't really have
  any idea. I'd like to edit a small book with images to show my illustration, design
  and typography capabilities but I just have no idea what to work on. If any of you
  have any idea of texts that would be nice to edit I'd be very interested.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot,\r\n\r\nPierre-Luc"

  body: Pierre, try working with a work that is in Public Domain. I suggest Alice's
    Adventures in Wonderland. Its abstract enough for you to go wild with your creative
    imagination and create a new spin on an old look.

  body: "You might even try a long poem such as T.S. Eliot's \"The Love Song of J.
    Alfred Prufock,\" or a series of shorter, concise poems like hiakus or something.
    If it's portfolio work, you probably don't have to choose something in public
    domain, but the comment above is a good one. If you plan to reproduce the work,
    publish it on the internet or sell the work in any way, be very careful of copyright
    laws. You might read <a href=\"http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html\">
