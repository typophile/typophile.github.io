  body: "Hi Angie.\r\nBeen a while.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the US will not allow copyright
    of fonts. They will, however, cover the digital data or software part. \r\n\r\nSo
    what that means is: if somebody redistributes the digital file and you can prove
    so you have a case. I think even if they alter it slightly and rename. If, however,
    somebody scans images of your letters and redigitizes it\u2026 the law will not
    cover it. That being said I've managed to stop that end of it as well. Most foundries
    will drop fonts that are from questionable sources. People selling fonts that
    are not theirs don't want to be publicly embarrassed at being exposed. \r\n\r\nSome
    foundries add digital watermarks to help track pirated versions, but its very
    hard to stop. My last P22 font was being pirated 2 days after release.\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: "We are in the process of registering copyrights on all of our font software
    with the USPTO. As I understand our lawyer's explanation, doing so allows one
    to sue for damages and costs. Without the formal registration, one can only sue
    for damages.\r\n\r\nAs more font makers allow some sort of web embedding to their
    EULA. (We plan on updating our license to allow EOT) registering the copyright
    will become more important.\r\n\r\nOne cannot stop font piracy, but with registered
    copyrights it can be viewed as a potential revenue stream, depending, of course,
    on who is the pirate.\r\n\r\nJames"
