body: "I just had a talk with an old friend, and remembered I once made a font in
  just three hours and four minutes. It was for AtypI 05. I'd promised to the House
  guys that (after they almost managed their Font Sprint in Vancouver) that I'd try
  to make a full character Western character set in under five hours. I used an old
  RoboFog for character design and kerning pairs, and FontLab for OT features. I'd
  made a file ready with guides, so I didn't start absolutelyfrom  scratch.\r\nThis
  took me 3 hours and 4 minutes from start to PDF sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mara_4489.png]\r\nI
  think it's ugly as f**k, but it works as a font. What do you think?"

    this sort of exercise might cheapen the craft. The good news is it makes you look
    good in terms of producing something not horrible in an extremely short time,
    illustrating the role of talent and skill to newbies who make an attempt and fail
    at making something decent even though they spend much more time (and often even
    start from somebody else's outlines).\r\n\r\nAnd the \"a\" is actually quite nice.

  body: "The application of the words \"sprint\" and \"marathon\" to non-running activities
    has always confused me. I'll be attending a life-drawing marathon tomorrow that
    goes for about 6 hours, and in a couple weeks a documentation sprint that takes
    place over 6 days, to use the names by which their respective organizers call
    them. I suppose they're both tests of speed and endurance, but not in any other
    way similar to any sort of athletic competition.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, that's a pretty
    admirable font you made there, all things considered. I'm capable of banging out
    as many glyphs in a similar amount of time, but they usually don't look that good
    when I do."
