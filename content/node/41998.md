  body: "Suggestion: use the search method described <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/12436\">here</a>
    and type in \"typograf\". This will lead you to several talks about this nice
    font management software for PCs. In case that's not what your looking for, there
    will be several other opportunities talked about within the same nodes, because
    typograf is only one possible solution.\r\n\r\nOr could you share some more information
    what exactly you're looking for?"

  body: "Thanks, Tina -- it appears that I did not search well enough...\r\n\r\nPreviously
    on a Mac, I had become accustomed to Font Explorer. Now that I'm on Windows Vista,
    I've been using Bitstream Font Navigator, but it just doesn't cut it. I really
    liked the fact that Font Explorer made this nice, clean database of my fonts when
    installed -- it did all of the organizing for me.\r\n\r\nI've tinkered a bit with
    [[http://www.high-logic.com/maintype.html|MainType]], but I honestly haven't devoted
    enough time to it to make a decision. I had never heard of Typograf, so I'll have
    to give it a try.\r\n\r\nCall me lazy, but I really just wanted a few people to
    say \"I love X software\", and move on. ;)"

  body: In two decades I evaluated almost all of them and clearly the best are Bitstream
    Font Navigator, Typograf (both already mentioned) and OT1 Font Manager (jmberthier.com).
    (Extensis Suitcase seemed quite promising but I found it buggy.) But each suits
    a very different purpose. Typograf is best for previewing fonts (and allows fonts
    "loading", i. e. temporary installation until next restart or manual unloading).
    OT1 Font Manager provides best options for printing the specimens and Font Navigator
    is best for routine installing/uninstalling fonts and managing groups of fonts.
    You could also try ThumbsPlus that is actually a picture manager, but supports
    all formats of fonts. Allows creating font thumbnails with custom text, installing
    fonts and all standard file operations with thumbnails so you can actually visually
    organize fonts by moving thumbnails into various subfolders you create. You can
    also print contact sheets, the same way as you would do with photos.

  body: "I have Typograf and love it. The interface isn't very elegant, but once you
    get used to it, it works very well. One window allows previewing, comparing and
    searching and another window has your font groups. It loads the font groups at
    start up unactivated. You just click on the icon in your system tray and select
    the group you want to load or install and it's that easy. You get full screen
    character maps also which I love. It also has general info screens, metric data
    and kerning pairs. It doesn't auto activate in Indesign but it is easy to make
    a font group of your project and activate that way.\r\n\r\nOne disclaimer, I'm
    not a type designer and there may be things you want in the software that I don't
    know about. I'd be happy to provide screenshots if you need them but it seems
    like they have some on the web site. \r\n\r\nI have used Suitcase, Font Agent
    Pro for Windows (caused my XP pro machine problems) and Fontexplorer from Linotype
    (which caused serious system font problems) and Font Navigator. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.neuber.com/typograph|Typograf]]\r\n\r\nHope
    this helped,\r\n\r\nSharon\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi guys... I hope I haven't busted on to your topic too late to attract attention!\r\n\r\nMy
    query is to be honest slightly off topic, but only slightly!\r\n\r\nI've been
    impressed with the way that Ubuntu (Linux) on my friends machine handles fonts
    in the regular Explorer-style filesystem, showing actual thumbnails of \"Aa\"
    for each font to give an at-a-glance representation.\r\n\r\nI've been searching
    for hours for some kind of plugin to do this in Windows XP explorer, but have
    found nothing and just hoped one of you guys might know of something that can
    do it, or at least put me out of my misery by telling me it definitely won't be
    found!\r\n\r\nJust to confirm, I'm not talking about a program, I want to be able
    to view live thumbnails of my .ttf files while I'm looking at the folder through
    the regular explorer set up. I hope it's not too much to ask!\r\n\r\nTo contribute
    back on topic... it's ironic really I've not used anything other than akFontExplorer
    for years upon years, I must admit its use for me is nothing more than occasional
    - when I'm looking for a font to use for a title or menu on a website I'm creating
    I'll load it up and see what looks good for the phrase/button/title in question.\r\n\r\nFrom
    the links you've posted, and bearing in mind the little use I would get out of/am
    looking for in a font management program, I have the luxury of pretty much being
    able to choose any package as the difference in advanced features is almost irrelevant
    to me when I'm only looking for previews.\r\n\r\nBased on that, and checking out
    manufacturer's websites and screenshots:\r\n - Typograf - I simply couldn't use
    this because of the Windows 3.1-looking GUI... i'm a such a ponce when it comes
    to things like this, but like I said when I'm only looking for simple functionality,
    I can afford to be choosy. The temporary installation thing would definitely be
    a potential pull though if I was to start using fonts more heavily\r\n - Extensis
    Suitcase - looks good but seems to be too interweaved with Adobe software rather
    than an independent tool\r\n - BitStream FontNavigator - despite finding the Bitstream
    homepage I couldn't find their page on FontNavigator - has it been discontinued?\r\n
    - MainType - looks very nice, will be trying this one myself\r\n\r\nAnd a couple
    of new ideas for you:\r\n - FontExpert 2007 (http://www.proximasoftware.com/fontexpert/screenshots.htm)
    - this one looks pretty good, think I'll give it a try\r\n - FontExplorer X (http://www.linotype.com/2629/fontexplorerxfeatures.html)
    - also looks pretty good and a FREE download... BUT... the PC version is in between
    beta and release candidates and as such doesnt' seem to be available anywhere
    at the moment! :-(\r\n\r\nNot sure how this turned into an essay but it did. Hope
    to get some kind of response from someone somewhen!!"

    site but not directly linked to:\r\n\r\nhttp://fex.linotype.com/download/pc/FontExplorerX-0.9.1.2250.exe\r\n\r\nquotes:\r\n\r\n\"It
    IS very glitchy. Not totally useless but you have to get over the fact that it
    totally messes up any directory of fonts. So make a seperate folder for the fonts
    you want to import into the program as it will delete those fonts from the original
    folder. Also make a backup copy of your windows fonts folder just in case it decides
    to remove the fonts from there too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hopefully they'll work out those
    kinks on the next release. The Mac version is the best font management software
    I've ever used.\"\r\n\r\n\"just yesterday after installing a font (not through
    lino type but through windows font folder) all fonts mysteriously turned to dots.
    Had to do system restore.\"\r\n\r\n\"the current version of suitcase is pants,
    and FontExplorer's definitely the best thing currently available.\"\r\n\r\n...so
    a pretty mixed response... a true shame as i was a bit excited about seeing this
    one, but on those warnings above I'm not going to be installing it til an RC is
    available.\r\n\r\n...also found a lot of people mentioning \"ATM Deluxe\" which
    turned out to be (I didn't know) Adobe Type Manager Deluxe... and although it
    seems well loved, it's old (very) and no longer available."

    options and MainType is by far the best. It's fast and easy to use, but very powerful.\r\nThe
    main thing I like about it is that it doesn't try to 'organise' your fonts for
    you. If your fonts are already organised how you like, it will work with this.\r\nYou
    can browse your active fonts or fonts in folders elsewhere on your computer. You
    get to see a sample preview which you can easily type over or revert to a number
    of presets, plus a full character map. You also get a choice between activating
    and permanently installing fonts.\r\nHope this helps.\r\nbtw I don't work for
    them, just seems that people have a lot of trouble finding decent, stable font
    managers for Windows!"
