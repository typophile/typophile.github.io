  in Word and other wordly mysteries\"</A> about how Windows Vista will have a native,
  low-level [[OpenType]] support, somebody mentioned that Mr. Simon Daniels (sii)
  might know something about enabling OpenType right in Notepad and Wordpad in Windows
  XP.\r\n\r\nOut of sheer curiosity, does anyone have any idea on how to do this?"

    - Control Panel - Regional and Language Options - Languages - Install files for
    complex script support... \r\n\r\nBasically this option forces NotePad to use
    the \"Uniscribe\" component. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "> Would that put more weight on the system?\r\n\r\nShort answer is yes, but
    this is the default in Vista, where every ounce of performance is critical, so
    the over all effect is not great.  \r\n"

  body: "Interesting. So that means OpenType support, both on Mac and Windows alike,
    doesn't have to be implemented deep in the code?\r\n\r\nI would suppose that there
    is no reason, then, to not have this support in newer programs like Office 2007
    -- because all you have to do is insert one .DLL file."
