  suitable for headings and identities. Haven't got a full set as of yet, but working
  on it! Just wanna see if people think I'm in the right direction. All comments appreciated.
  \r\n\r\n[edit] Updated with more letters :)"

  body: once you have a standard build for every letter, the font will not be so hard
    for you to make, i like it and once its out, i will use it :)

  body: the q still needs help. maybe just a little bar going from the inside to the
    lower right corner? Or a verical line inside of the bowl?

  body: Haha, hey Drew! It's font design, yeah, hah! It's quite enjoyable! Tho he
    said I should try to make it look a little more original cos it looks a bit like
    other fonts out there, suggesting a slab seriff. I mean, slab seriffs are nasty,
    I wanna do a font I can use later for headers, identity etc.

    in the stduio brief we got atm....\r\n\r\ni was gonna do font design, but i thought
    bugger it, i already got alot of type in my folio... so doing illustraion as design
    instead... you done it?\r\n\r\nyou could turn this into a serif without that to
    much hassel, the C would look ace as a serif... do you have to do a lower case
    as well? or are you just doing a uni case?"

  body: "Yep, I'm doing a full character set, woop! \r\n\r\nAh, yeah I did illustration
    last semester, I didn't like it too much, didn't feel like i got stuff i could
    use for my folio, might've changed for this semester tho. But I'm happy with my
    font design class, i wanna learn how to use the font software and stuff too so
    i can turn them into *actually* working fonts. "

  body: I recomend you design these in black on a white background, if you want these
    to be the most usable later on. Having different colored backgrounds can cause
    the letters to look slightly different, depending on the contrast.

  body: "What about a PDF? :)\r\nI think most of the lowercase letters are a bit too
    wide, they look stretched.:)\r\nParticularly visible in the 'u' and 'y'. I see
    that a lot of them are just as wide as the UC, or mono-width. If that is what
    you intended to do, I do think most of the LC characters need some work. It doesn't
    look right at the moment.\r\nThe UC chars look quite alright now."
