body: "I am considering Storm Open Library for purchase and was looking through their
  character sets, as no font is of any use to me unless it has characters with Baltic
  diacriticals. It surprised me to see that the sample of Jannon character set @ http://www.pismolijna.cz/pdf/JBWset.pdf
  (page 17) included characters with almost any diacriticals, except Z with the \"upside
  down roof\" (sorry, I have no idea for the correct term in English, but it looks
  like \\/ over the character), which is quite common even in simple font sets. Is
  it a mistake or it really isn't there (I really need that char, so it would blow
  away all my true drooling over the CD :D) ?\r\n Edit: other character sets presented
  there don't have the aforementioned char as well."

  body: "mncz, the accent you refer to is the \"caron\", and the Scaron and Zcaron
    (upper- and lowercase) are standard in the ISO 8859-1 character set, although
    many Western European and American designers didn't design these glyphs - and
    the Lslash, Thorn, and Eth - because they were inaccessible with English-langauge
    keyboards.\r\n\r\nAll of which to say: it could be that Mr \u0160torm has indeed
    included these basic characters in his fonts, but there was an oversight - aka
    \"mistake\" - when generating the glyph tables for the \u0160tormtype site.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I second Fav's suggestion that you contact Mr \u0160torm directly.  From the site:\r\n\r\n\xA9

    Sebastian, Serapion, Regent and Walbaum, and they all have it too.
