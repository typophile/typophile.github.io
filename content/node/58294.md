body: "Packard was designed by Oz Cooper and patented in 1915 (# 47641).\r\nIt's based
  on a lettering he did for Packard automobile advertising.  I am publishing a book
  on Packard and would like to use the face for chapter headings.  Any idea where
  I can find it for sale.  I have seen it in a recently published children's book
  so it's out there someplace.  Any help much appreciated.  \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nArthur\r\n\r\n"

    Patrician NF</a> maybe the one you're looking for? It looks like it was released
    by BB&S as a metal face, so it's entirely plausible it's the one you saw in the
    children's book.\r\n\r\nAs always, it would help greatly if you posted a sample
    of what you were looking for."
