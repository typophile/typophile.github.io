body: "I want to import kerning from one 4-master vfb to another. I use paste special.
  I must select 'ignore destination selection' because otherwise I get a transposition,
  even though encoding is identical.\r\n\r\nBut now something worse occurs. 1400 pairs
  in the original, and only 800 in the copy. Strange things like all kern pairs between
  y and eacute are missing. \r\n\r\nIn other words, the program simply isn't doing
  what it is supposed to do, and every last step has to be checked. Most laboriously!
  \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe how anyone could reliably use this program as
  a production tool as is, and I imagine that those who do this on a large scale basis
  have various scripts, perhaps outside of Fontlab, that accomplish these operations
  in a reliable manner. \r\n\r\nWe've been slagging Fog a lot lately, but I never
  remember it being quite so unreliable in so many unexpected ways. However, there's
  no turning back! \r\n\r\n"

    don\u2019t disagree with you there. Every time Fontlab crashes because I used
    a keyboard chord to enter an accented character into the metrics window I think
    that we should start doing annual fund raisers for Fontforge. Fontlab is very
    good for some stuff, but it\u2019s drawbacks can really eat up a lot of time when
    one is working on projects solo. I got Fontforge working on Friday night and I\u2019m
    going to be reading the tutorials over the next week."

    program. \r\n\r\nI should have known better after all these years! \r\n\r\nThanks
    also for being so prompt. I would have gone nuts in another five minutes, wondering
    what to do next.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to know how you get on with Fontforge.
    But doesn't it only do TT outlines? "

    It handles Type 1 as well and can output OpenType. I just find the interface less
    easy to use than FontLab. "

  body: "Bill, if you remember, Fontographer had all sorts of bugs. I use to keep
    a separate kerning file for every font, because Fontographer always messed up
    anything over decimal 255 . . .\r\n\r\nWhen FontLab first came out, I kept using
    Fontographer because it was what I knew. Except at the end, I added the step of
    running the font through FL, to get rid of those Fontographer bugs.\r\n\r\nOld
    habit die hard. Even using FL, I still write all OT features in a text editor
    & import them (& save them as a text file).\r\n\r\nMy current grumble with FL
    is it doesn't support mark and mkmk. Waiting for version 6.0, I guess. "

  body: "A couple of warnings re. using AFMs to export/import kerning.\r\n\r\nAFMs
    have a presumed UPM of 1000, which means that if your font has a different UPM
    you will get rounding errors in kern pair values.\r\n\r\nFontLab, historically
    at any rate, had problems with importing AFM kern data over a certain size: pairs
    would be dropped.\r\n\r\nThe real answer to this is Python scripts, which can
    very easily write lists of kern pairs for any UPM and import the same cleanly.
    Karsten Luecke wrote mine for me."
