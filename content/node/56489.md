  body: "Thanks Mike! I had a slight feeling it was a freefont.\r\nThere are some
    things that I don't like about it,...\r\nIt might sound strange but I prefer commercial
    fonts, \r\nbecause of many reasons such as kerning and spacing.\r\nSo I hope someone
    could say which fonts are good alternative(s).\r\nThanks again, Ilse."

  body: "That doesn't sound strange at all. Those are just some of the reasons why
    commercial foundries can charge money for their fonts.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of
    <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chaletcomprime\" target=\"_blank\">Chalet
    Comprim\xE9</a>, although it's not as narrow, yet it's squarer and rounder than
    regular Chalet.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
