    there is nothing to install, since I never owned the app. \r\n\r\nBut this is

    on Windows the bundled fonts are not installed in the fonts folder, but remain

    that\", it didn't. Employees made those decisions.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, there's
    one thing we can agree on. Generally, *somebody* makes a decision.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    actually there are also cases where there's never or rarely a conscious decision,
    just a cumulative effect of lots of little decisions (either independently, or
    building on top of each other).\r\n\r\nI don't see bundling of fonts by OS or
    app vendors as any of those things Nick mentioned. However, I do largely agree
    with the argument that such bundling tends to drive down the perceived value of
    fonts in the minds of end users, which is the concern underlying Nick's harsh
    verbiage.\r\n\r\nIf the company either has a retail font business (like Adobe,
    even if it is tiny compared to their app business), or has a strategic interest
    in there being a healthy marketplace for fonts (Adobe, Apple and arguably Microsoft),
    then they need to think hard about how many and which fonts they bundle.\r\n\r\nOne
    part of font bundling that makes particular sense for Adobe is fonts as registration
    incentives. Those fonts get far more publicity/mileage and attention then the
    other bundled fonts, and they encourage product registration which is of special
    value to the company. They are actually perceived and marketed as added value
    in a way that the \"everyday\" bundled fonts are not so much.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    one can never know if the success of a bundled typeface is a result of merit or
    a lack of cost.\r\nIt must be reassuring to know that Arno worked well as a registration
    incentive. \r\nThere are bundled typefaces that have been vilified for their popularity,
    Comic Sans and Papyrus of course.\r\nImpact is another face which IMO doesn't

    just saying that one can make a good business case (for at least some companies)
