  body: Yes, but I wouldn't say that it is super common. Oftentimes there is a small
    cap %. That might work better than a "cap" one. But you'd have to be using a font
    that has it, I guess!

    in one typeface, Oneleigh OT. \r\nThat has a small x-height and the lining figures
    are cap height, so there is quite a disparity in the size of lining and oldstyle
    figures.\r\nOtherwise I think the standard percentage sign works fine for both
    lining and oldstyle figures--and the \"small caps\" percentage symbol doesn't

  body: "Here is how I chose to handle the % sign in the two figure sets of Whitman.
    It may not be obvious, but the \"8-height\" of the OsF is smaller than that of
    LF (which is cap height). So, the two %s have slightly different heights as well
    as zero shapes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Whitman-percents3_3917.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nI
    think a \"small cap\" % would only make sense in the context of small cap figures
    -- i.e., lining figures at SC height. In running text with U&lc and OsF, it is
    too small and distracting, as James noted."

  body: "<cite>Always space before percent-sign in Norwegian, Frode. I recommend thin
    space.</cite>\r\n\r\nEntering the discussion late, and maybe off-topic. Sigh.
    The question is, are there any circumstances when you would not thin-space the
    percentage sign? If not, the extra space should be in the (left) sidebearing.
    Of course, that might screw up people who had learned to use always use a thinspace.
    Alternatively, you could have a kern -- a class kern -- which would properly space
    the percent sign when no space was used, but would not be applied when any sort
    of space intervened between [0-9] and percent.\r\n\r\nI feel the same thinking
    applies to the hashmark (aka numbersign). There is often a fair bit of kerning/sidebearing
    adjustment needed with marks that appear with numbers. When those marks can also
    appear with letters, kerning is all you have. For the rest, why not adjust the
    sidebearing?\r\n\r\nBTW, I usually make up an oldstyle hashmark. Typically, they
    are too broad, and sit too high. Sometimes they seem to be drawn too broad for
    even the lining figures.\r\n"

    figures.</cite>\r\n\r\nThink about this: The majority of lowercase letters occupy
    primarily the x-height region, but does that mean a question mark would work better
    at only x-height tall? Does the presence of descending, as well as ascending,
    letters mean that the question mark should descend if it's going to also reach
    to the ascender or cap height? How well does the question mark \"work\" with a
    word like gypsy? "
