  I can afford to go over the top. I&#39;m trying to find resources on hand done binding
  but I cant really find any. I saw something Chris Moorby did - it was all magenta
  and was in CR a year or so ago i was looking for something like that? Any Ideas?

    <BR> <BR>This might be of interest. Not as involved as other hand-binding methods.
