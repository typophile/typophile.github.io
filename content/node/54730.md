  might? Anyone out there know IF original Issues of U&lc -- are valuable? ...collectible?

  body: "I don't know whether they are valuable or not, but they might be rare. For
    example, on eBay I always see both Emigre magazines and books. However, when I
    search for U&lc, I just get the book; no issues of the magazine. Maybe the owners
    don't want to part with their copies?\r\n\r\nIn case you're interested, there
    was a recent thread about old issues of Emigre here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/53176\r\n"

  body: Thanks for both, the info and the 52967 link. I DID try the search field,
    but it didn't work at all. (?) I'm new to Typophile and maybe I don't know the
    "trick" to it.

    engine. ;-)

  body: "My friendly local bookseller recently flogged me 16 copies of U&lc from the
    early/mid '80s... she had them marked at NZ$5 a pop, but we came to an arrangement
    on a lesser price for the job lot. I bought them because they reminded me of my
    undergraduate days at Middlesex Poly, where they were used as case studies for
    a lecture on grid construction.\r\n\r\nI don't think they're valuable, but as
    Ricardo says, they will be rare and/or collectable \u2013 if only because they
    are deteriorating faster than my (almost as old) copies of Baseline and Emigre
    magazines \u2013 which I still use for teaching purposes. \r\n\r\nJohn D. Berry's
    so right about all that crumbling newsprint in designers' attics..."

  body: With magazines like <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em> scanning
    their entire back catalogue, page by page, and putting them on DVDs, I wonder
    if the same could be done for <em>U&lc</em>... Just a thought that flashed through
    my head while reading ben's comment.
