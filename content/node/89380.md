  my computer, or does their computer change into something else? Any other related

  body: "The message will be rendered using the default font used by the e-mail software.\r\nIn
    case of HTML e-mail, CSS font-family \"stack\" priority should apply."

  body: In that case, it seems one would want to send emails in a font that is very
    likely to be in the possession of the recipient, to eliminate change to the structure
    of the email from rendering into something else. Does this make sense?

    used in email. Most email clients do not yet support @font-face, which would allow
    for arbitrary fonts in HTML email.\r\n"

    not a problem of e-mail per se, but of rendering engines used by e-mail software
    (for example, Outlook is using Word\u2019s HTML rendering because they couldn\u2019t
    afford to license IE\u2019s one \u2013 I\u2019m not kidding). Since most e-mail
    clients can display images hosted on remote servers, there\u2019s no reason why
    they couldn\u2019t do the same with remotely hosted fonts."

  body: "You know, that's a great point that email in browsers could be generally
    @font-face enabled. Sweet!\r\n\r\nIn my case, I get my work email in Outlook,
    but my personal email in gmail, usually in Chrome. (And both sometimes in my iPhone's
    Mail app, which also supports @font-face.) So my personal email may always support
    @font-face, I suppose. Assuming that gmail passes through the inline CSS to the
    browser or viewing app, mind you.\r\n\r\nOne complication for @font-face in email
    even in the future will be that it presumably won't play well with anybody who
    doesn't want other people leaching their bandwidth. Folks generally do that via
    checking the referrer string in the get request. To make this work with email,
    I think the font hoster would have to allow \"localhost\" as a referrer, but that
    would enable *anybody* to borrow the code and use the same font in email (though
    not for external web sites), with the original host footing the bill for the bandwidth.
    Leastways that's what it seems like at first thought.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing
    something, but it seems to me that because of this, web fonts for email would
    be pretty much be restricted to Google Web Fonts.\r\n\r\nT"
