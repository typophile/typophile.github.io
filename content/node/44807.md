  body: "Hi Patrick,\r\n\r\nnever seen this \u2026 What\u2019s the source?\r\nWhile
    I like the \u2018p\u2019, I find the \u2018a\u2019 rather \u2026\_unusual, and
    the \u2018t\u2019 downright ugly.\r\nThe only typeface that comes to my mind is
    [[David Quay]]\u2019s irregular script <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/coptek/?sample_text=past&sample_size=96\">Coptek</a>
    \u2013 I am not saying that it is anywhere close, though.\r\nF"

    (oh the nostalgia). Was just trying to match the typefaces they used in their
    logo. Here is said logo.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chamberlogoc4_4279.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty
    sure \"Parowan\" is Anna and \"Chamber of Commerce\" is copperplate, but just
    can't find anything for the top text.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Patrick"
