body: "I've been struggling with a logo for a long, long time. It's for a natural
  foods grocery store. I presented a much earlier version and received helpful advice,
  though this version does not neccessarily include that. \r\nIn order to maintain
  a certain handmade feel, and to create a sense of history, I'd love to utilize type
  that relates to the hand painted windows and signs of day gone by. I'm interested
  primarily in type that either stem from long enough ago that they smack of history,
  or that comes from the mid-seventies, when the store was founded. Currently, I have
  three logo consepts in progress. One that feels way back, using Brothers by John
  Downer, another that should feel a little groovy, but still contemporary (hopefully
  I'll find something just right--maybe a rounded serif Didone?) and the attached.
  I'd like this to feel very contemporary, but I don't want to give up the history.
  It's Century Gothic, but I'd love to hear if anyone knows of a more interesting
  geometric gothic with some roots in brush lettering.\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    from Font Bureau. It is nice and geometric but has more of a hand painted feel
    than Century.

    goping to look over eagle anyway, but there are two econofoods within 100 miles
    of us. In my defense, I've not been to either, but I certainly can't say for certain
    that I've never seen one before.\r\nI've been trying to draw out stuff from Letterhead
    fonts for about a week. We can't buy anything until we're committed, so I'm working
    with a brush and pen for now. As far as that goes, you'll notice I haven't posted
    any of that concept yet. Heart's in the right place, the hand with the pen in
    it, however, is not."

    gives you a better idea of where to go. I feel like your example is too rigid
    and geometric for what a 'natural' oriented crowd this store would bring in."
