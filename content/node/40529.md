  body: "If you look at the letter \"x\" in Bauhaus, you'll see that it isnt Bauhaus.
    \r\nBauhaus has the traditional straight lined x, whereas this has more curvature
    to it.\r\nHas me completely stomped."

    two others you could add that look similar:\r\n[[http://www.fontfiles.com/Fonts/Detailed/961.html|Cupertino]]\r\n[[http://www.eff.co.uk/M/Page/MrJones.htm|Mr

  body: "Thanks Ben. I am reluctant to add those, partly because those sources are
    not ones where you can be sure the names are the real ones, if you know what I
    mean. In most cases I have tried to use the original names of the font designs
    in my Guides, if I have a way to confirm them. Usually if I know the name of the
    designer, or get it from an actual foundry, or see it in a font book, then I feel
    confident about the authenticity of the font name.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Indeed, Mike. Cupertino is a digitization of <a href="http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fsample.asp?scode=SU_MTT&lang=en"
    target="_blank">Motter Tektura</a>. The other looks familiar (VGC?), but I don't
    know.

  body: ":) Yes, Motter Tektura is the proper one! It's a hard thing to know what's
    what sometimes. There's a lot of dubious fonts out there. Those unfortunate caps
    in Cupertino should have warned me! The other I believe is original.\r\nThanks
    for your list all the same. "

    the closest typeface i can find is decker.I realise this sample is somewhat customised,
    but it in addition to the angles \"A\", it doesn't really have the same impact.
    Anyone got any ideas?\r\nCheers!\r\n[e]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.erickelleher.com/downloads/typetest.jpg"
