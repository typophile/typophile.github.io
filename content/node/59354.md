body: "Hi\r\nWe are rebranding our (training) company and our logo uses Bryant font
  from Process. I'm wondering if anyone has paired Bryant with a serif font for immersive
  reading. So far the suggestions have been Officina Serif, Minion and Georgia. To
  me these don't quite work and I've had a look at Meta Serif, Utopia, Melior and
  Fedra Serif B. I might licence the first two of these to see which looks nicest
  and post some samples for crit here, but first of all wondered if anyone had a combination
  they thought was really successful.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'm finding Bryant a bit
  difficult to use as there's so much space between the letters and the wide rounded
  tone feels a bit too cartoony next to very sober fonts (it looked very strange next
  to Garamond, Minion and New Baskerville!)\r\n\r\n(Actually I thought that Myriad
  looked neat with Bryant, they do contrast quite well despite both being sans serif
  designs. Obviously there's the tension between humanist and geometric, rounded and
  flat terminals, so maybe that explains it. But our creative director said they didn't
  work too well together.)"

    like Officina Serif is too busy (too many corners) and too narrow and too quirky
    for immersive reading. And it's also been around a few years. Does anyone disagree
    that Meta Serif works well as a companion to Bryant?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bryant-Companions_6007.gif]"

    is very hard answer such questions until you look at the intended layout. '

  body: Hi, thanks William. I'm not exactly wanting to match characteristics because
    I think the wide proportions of Bryant won't allow enough text on the page for
    extended body copy. I'm creating a brochure with Bryant for headings, subheadings
    and quotes, then need something to give details and descriptions of services.
    I need something space-efficient, readable and harmonising (so contrasting rather
    than matching I guess). I thought the square forms and terminals of Meta Serif
    would balance out the almost overpowering roundness of Bryant, whilst the vertical
    stress seems to relate to the geometric and monolinear structure of Bryant in
    a way that something like Garamond, Sabon or Minion didn't. And it's lower contrast
    than New Baskerville.

  body: "Kent, that's really interesting as I tried Bodoni and Joanna along the way.
    I think Modern serif fonts fit well with Bryant, so Whitman would be a good companion.
    It looks nice and elegant. \r\n\r\nFor my brochure though, I think I'm looking
    for something more humanist (meaning that Officina Sans and Meta Sans strike me
    as humanist, and their Serif siblings are built from the same bones). I worry
    that there's a bit too much roundness in Bryant, so I'm after something where
    the curves and counters are a bit less round looking.\r\n\r\nJos, thanks for posting
    this; as you know I'm quite excited by Calluna, and especially the italic (vwxyz
    are enviable). I'm not sure if you're looking for critique and this isn't the
    right thread anyway. As for my brochure, I think it has the right tone but to
    me the oldstyle stress doesn't sit very comfortably with Bryant's unsophisticated
    geometry.\r\n\r\nIt'll be interesting to see what others think of these combinations."

    pops into my mind. Which is strange because I've never worked with Scala. But
    looking at samples, maybe it could work quite well. \r\n\r\nI think Whitman might
    be great too. A bit more \"literary\" than Scala maybe? It looks \"harder\" next
    to the utter roundness of Bryant than Scala does, too.\r\nI think Calluna is not
    a bad match either, but next to Bryant it looks *very* old-style. Not sure if
    that's the intended tone?"

    now than the titles; I think the whole thing still looks a bit unbalanced. Actually,
    if you can't make them sing together, I think I'd let go of the idea that the
