<div class=commentbody>I have went through every preference in Illustrator. I am wondering if this is some strange OSX thing. <br> <br>Cept, I don't see it in other programs. I have deciphered why it is there (I think). When you shift-click and move an object it shows the boundries you can move before the object snaps onto the next coordinate. But, I don't need to know that. <br> <br>Grr. Where's that Adobe guy?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Illustrator CS is much improved. They new type engine (or whatever that is called) is sooooo much faster. It makes me smile more with every use. The opentype panel is cool too. The 3D stuff (although I've only tinkered) is nice. I keep the links palette and the navigation palette closed and that seems to help speed it up. Although, it is still much faster than AI10. I'm a speed freak, so I would always be happier with faster software. <br> <br>[Sidenote: I still find InDesign CS (compared to InDesign 2) very slow. In my mind it seems it should be able to be as fast as quark. Why isn't it? Maybe a new thread topic.]</div>

<div class=commentbody>>>In my mind it seems it should be able to be as fast as quark. Why isn't it? <br> <br>This isn't really my field, so I could be talking nonsense, but the thing that springs to mind is that you are probably doing much more with InD, than you did with Quark - even if you don't realise it. <br>For example, if your Quark experience is pre-version 6, then you were working without multiple undo. Think of all the available options that make you want to use InD, rather than Quark. Now, even if you're not using them, you might be, so InD has to check to see if you are, and it has to leave the door open in case you want to in the future, and then it has to leave a route back to anywhere in your session, incase you want to undo your way all the way back to lunchtime. <br>This is why we all have to keep buying new hardware - because the software does so many new things (which we all take for granted after about 15 seconds). <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Myself, I have found InD CS slightly faster than 2.0, although it is still slower than QuarkXPress. OTOH, QXP 6 is considerably slower than previous versions of QXP.... <br> <br>Steve's right that many of the standard features of InDesign will slow it down. For example: <br>- hi-res graphics previews <br>- paragraph composer <br>- unlimited undo <br> <br>If performance is an issue, one can adjust some of these (and other options) to improve performance, at a cost of features. I believe there is a standard tech note on improving InD performance on the Adobe Web site. <br> <br>(BTW, no clue on the grey box in Illustrator. Sorry.) <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>> This is why we all have to keep buying new hardware - because the software does so many new things <br> <br>Naaah. I think the real reason is that inefficient code is good for this perception-driven economy (as long as all the big players are about equally inefficient). Fontographer 3.1 does most of what 4 does, and it's magnitudes leaner and faster - I used to run it in 512 RAM with one floppy drive... under Mac emulation! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
