body: "Has anyone ever heard of a font called SimpleType? It\u2019s a san serif condensed
  font that one of my coworkers got as freeware. Now the art director want to use
  something that looks exactly like it but that we can buy and have a license for.
  Does anyone know a similar font? See attachment. This font was sold as freeware
  by Swfte International.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\ndiane t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simple_type_5252.png]"
