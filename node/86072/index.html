  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm currently designing a product catalog that contains a lot of tables. I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how fractions should be vertically aligned within a table. I've always tended to gravitate towards right-justification for numerals, but I'm wondering if it might be more effective/look better to align fractions to the slash.

</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Depending on the typeface you're using, there may be specifically-designed fractions, which may solve the alignment issue - if you're using an OpenType, it may be worth a hunt through the glyphs.

As far as I know, there's nothing in Bringhurst or Hart's about aligning fractions against the solidus, however Hart's does have a useful section on tables that discusses when to align numerals against the column heading or also with the final digit or decimal point (when the data is related or not). Using that rule of aligning decimal points, it could be reasoned that the same would apply with aligning against the solidus in large numbers (no pun intended) of fractions, preserving the vertical flow.

Hope that helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for your help JDL - much appreciated. Bringhurst was (and tends to always be) my first reference. going to have to get a hold of Hunt's book. could I get a title for that?

I attached an image of one of the tables I've constructed - perhaps this will help visualize what my words can't. 

I am using the fraction formatting specific to the typeface. maybe the larger issue is how to align the five sub-columns within the "DIMENSIONS" column (the three dimensions and the two "x" that go between them). as you can see, some of the figures really vary in length, which makes it really challenging to develop any sort of alignment parameters for controlling these variables.

It is all about organizing information so that it can be quickly understood. If someone is looking through a big list for parts that are 10" long or longer, numbers that have been pushed a whole figure width to the left will be unwelcome distractions.</div>

Align them to where the decimal point would be, because the first "at a glance" categorization that is most relevant to the reader is between figures that are integers and those that are part of fractions. 
The way you have it now is like flush righting 1.3 and 1.03

Also, you should stick to either old style or lining throughout—those prices in osf are too precious.</div>

That's no different than aligning on "where the decimal point would be", as you're using tab figures.

Another detail: I'm impressed that you aren't using dumb quotes for inch marks, but what you have look more like Hungarian umlauts than inch marks. Are there proper inch marks in the font?

What does –11/–24 refer to? Shouldn't there be more space before the dash?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Nick. The glyphs for this typeface are pretty extensive. And to be completely honest, I'm not entirely sure if these are the proper inch marks or not. All I know is that they aren't the quote marks.

I think you're also right about the space before the dash. That dimension refers to the thread size on the hub of these wheels. This format is apparently the standard for the industry.

		<div class="commentbody">David - I agree completely. Initially what I had done was bumped the numerators and denominators up to the next weight in order to make the overall optical weight of the fractions more harmonious with the other figures. However, what I found when doing a test print was that the fractions became TOO weighty due to ink bleed. 

Honestly, it was a great reminder to trust in the decisions of the type designer. </div>

Obviously, looking at these on screen is not the best way of gauging legibility for print - but take a look and tell me what you think.

ROW 2: medium weight numerators and denominators

I don't feel qualified to judge legibility for print based on over-sized screen renderings. I was commenting on the overall density of the fractions vs the figs. I'm sure you've solved it as best as possible by now. 

Good luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I worked in a small agency in the 1980s and designed a few product catalogs for tools companies, which contained tables like this with fractions and inch marks. That gave me an appreciation for this kind of "technical" typography.

It's not the sort of thing that gets much respect in the design community, but it's the real deal.

Based on that experience as a typographer, I've been putting a Fractions feature in all my fonts since OpenType, but have only put proper inch marks in the Modern Suite fonts. Frankly, it doesn't seem worth the effort—primarily because they're so hard to locate in the glyph palette that I doubt people would use them. For serifed fonts, it's easier to get them from the Symbol font. 

I did briefly entertain the idea of rendering all my dumb quotes (quotedbl) angled, so they would perform both as inch marks, and as an admonition to typographers to set proper curly quotes—but realized that wouldn't be very user-friendly.</div>
