<p>This seems to be reflected in Typophile memberships too. When you read an interesting post and want to know the author&rsquo;s profile, something like 3 out of 5 times, it&rsquo;s somebody in Canada!</p>
<p>Is there a background to this? Does Canada indeed have a particularly strong typographic tradition? If yes, how did it come about?</p>
<p>While one reads so much about typography and the Netherlands, I really haven&rsquo;t seen much about Canada. Would love to know more.</p>
<p>If this ground has been covered already in an earlier thread, I&rsquo;d be grateful if anybody can point me to it.</p>

<p>If cold climate was the only reason for having a rich typographic life, Scandinavia should be well up there, too. I know there&rsquo;s some life in Sweden, and even budding typelife in Finland, where the art has been almost non-existant until fairly recently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering about the Canadian angle, too. The Canadians here have definately made me more interested in their country.</p>

<p>And I suspect that one reason there are so many of us on Typophile is that, on a per capita basis, Canada has one of the highest populations with good internet service. Whether that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re hibernating from the weather in winter or we&rsquo;re technically literate (or both, I guess) is moot.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the various reasons one might begin an interest in typography, but for my part a big influence and source of inspiration is the community here in western Canada, and how generous and enthusiastic that community is (despite the fact that I rarely see any/many of these folks in person). In British Columbia, for instance, there&rsquo;s a handful of people who have had a major impact on my work and interests, including Jan &amp; Crispin Elsted (of Barbarian Press in Mission, BC - likely one of the finest letterpress printer/publishers out there), Bringhurst in the Gulf Islands, Jim Rimmer and Robert Reid in Vancouver, and then there&rsquo;s the Alcuin Society in Vancouver as well, which puts on Canada&rsquo;s national book design awards along with various other book-related events such as the Wayzgoose fine-press book fair which just happened on November 17th at the Vancouver Public Library. There are also a lot of small, fine-press publishers around here who have formed a fairly tight sense of community, largely over the wire, but it keeps things interesting to swap stories with others wrestling with font choice and tricky Vandercooks.</p>
<p>And as for the crack about the CBC, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that CBC Radio 2 is a contributing factor to much of the book work coming out of Canada: almost everyone I know who makes books has that station on in the background 18 hours a day.</p>
<p>And the weather probably does play a certain role: here in the Okanagan it&rsquo;s 40 degrees in the summer, so all you can do is sit in the shade and read in the afternoons, and in the winter it&rsquo;s minus 30, so you&rsquo;d best find a cozy chair and a good book in the evenings.</p>
<p>Aside from that, maybe we can haul up the stereotypes and talk about our (self-perceived) reserved and quiet temperaments, combined with a romantic taste for the simple and understated: typography certainly fits the bill.</p>

<p>James,
What makes you think they don&rsquo;t? We have done it many many times. Sometimes you win and sometimes you don&rsquo;t. Sometimes the client says &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my money, not yours so we are using Papyrus&rdquo;.  Sometimes a VP for marketing is trying to show the boss he is worth his 6-figure salary and has to &ldquo;save the day&rdquo; by changing the typeface to something with more &ldquo;pizzaz&rdquo;.  This is the real world where most designers struggle to do good work despite the overlord&rsquo;s need for control.</p>

<p>Toronto is neither eastern Canada or a real coast. And if you&rsquo;re referring to NB/NS/PEI/NFLD, you really ought to spend more time there. Halifax is one of my top 5 places in the world I love.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Canada has a tradition in the graphic arts, especially in Montreal and Toronto, back into the 19th century.
But no type design until 1967 (Cartier, by Carl Dair.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;had MacDonald chosen to turn his talents to typography he might have made a name for himself in Canada comparable to that of Frederick W. Goudy or T.M. Cleland in the United States&rdquo; &ndash; art critic William Colgate, 1940.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s referring to graphic designer J.E.H. MacDonald, better known as a painter and founder of the Group of Seven. MacDonald&rsquo;s iconic landscapes now sell in the multi-millions, but in the days before the Canada Council supported artists, in a small country like Canada, the Group of Seven worked as graphic designers, at studio Grip Ltd. Among his many talents, MacDonald was an accomplished lettering artist, and had there been any type foundries in Canada in the early 20th century, no doubt he would have designed some typefaces that would be well-known today.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t so much that he didn&rsquo;t chose typography, but type design wasn&rsquo;t really an option available to him.</p>

<p>Yes, I debated mentioning that in my first post, but decided it wasn&rsquo;t important.
However, on reflection, and considering the work of SIL up to the present day, it may be considered a significant part of the big picture, which isn&rsquo;t only about the commercial world of typography.</p>

<p>True enough, except that to get there, they beat the team where I live (I hate the Stamps), my fave team (lifelong Lions fan), and the city of my birth. On the bright side, an old friend used to coach the &lsquo;Riders defensive backs, so I&rsquo;ll take some small pleasure in that.</p>

<p>I was really pulling for Winnipeg Sunday, then the end of the 2nd quarter went downhill, fast, for them.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To counter the sports talk, let me make a really important comment about Canada.</p>
<p>I was in Vancouver in June 04 and Halifax in July 05 during their jazz festivals. This was pure chance, dependent solely on the timing of meetings. I stayed up so late so many nights that I was not really worth a damn at the conferences I was supposed to be attending. The quality and adventure shown by the &ldquo;avant&rdquo; bands, both local and those from far away was quite astounding. Both festivals made good use of fine musicians who live in those regions.</p>
<p>Would that the jazz festivals here in the midwest were anywhere near that good. I don&rsquo;t think I could have heard that much of that sort of jazz anywhere except the really big jazz cities, and I don&rsquo;t care to travel to them. &amp; I found both cities to be comfortable for walking back to my hotels in the early morning, both in terms of weather and personal safety.</p>
<p>If this level of support for adventurous music is any indicator, then Canada [or at least those two cities] sets the culture bar very high.</p>

<p>I honestly think people would have complained no matter what they were though.
