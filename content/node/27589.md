  could find was<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11004.8.4&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Gnostech&sampleSize=48\">
  FF Transit Back Positive Italic</a>. Then I suggested graphic widening to get closer,
  but I know how we all hate those answers, so I was hoping someone might recognize
  the font. \r\n\r\nThanks,  - Mike"
