body: "This post is kinda a follower of this post:  http://typophile.com/node/58334\r\n\r\nWe
  recently agreed with DFi that they need a font for their lines of product. A first
  attempt of this project was made 10 years ago;\r\nI've made drafts of some logos,
  but have to step back the project. One logo was made from these drafts i made, but
  not finalised by me.\r\nhere it is:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/old-Safe-Mail_4061.jpg]\r\nThis
  logo had a great success through DFi customers, and they were know for that technology
  and that logo (... :-/ )\r\nSo the font MUST look like that logo and match the style.\r\n\r\nAfter
  somes trial, we also agreed that one black font was too heavy to be used alone and
  must be tempered with a lighter font.\r\nOn basis of trials made with Myriad italic,
  they choose the Black/Standard mix. I tempered thas choice by making a semi-black
  (or extra-bold, i don't know how to call this) and a slighty bolder standard.\r\n\r\nhere
  is the draft of the new SafeMail Logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/safemail03_5599.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've
  just finished the last letter of the extra-bold font, as it is my first work  of
  this amplitude, i need all the help i can find!\r\nhave all the letter the same
  boldness, have all the letter the same angle, is the style consistent enough, or
  whatever looks wrong or unbalanced.\r\nDon't forget that the style of the font is
  predetermined by the old logo SafeMail.\r\n\r\nI join a PDF in file attachment of
  the extra-bold (or semi-black...) font. The standard font will come soon to join
  it.\r\nAny help, any comments are warmly welcomed.\r\n\r\nEDIT02: i've just uploaded
  2 new pdf where i've made some change to the G, J, L and Q in extrabold and reported
  these changes in the standard.\r\n\r\nEDIT03: i've tempered a bit the waveness\r\n\r\nEDIT04:
  i've removed the angles\r\n\r\nEDIT06: for the black font, i've have standardized
  the ascendant of letter, remake the K, modify the Q\r\n"

    whenever I look at them. The idea is nice, but I think it needs to be toned down
    quite a bit before it'll be useable.\r\n\r\npenn"

    a lot of ship race, and are involved in a lot of water sport, it's their thing.\r\n\r\ni
    don't know the importance of the information i give in the first post, these font
    will for now used only in their line of product logo, they want it to look like
    these drafts\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typodraft_6295.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    i know i've been to 'generous' with the curves and i've tried to correct it a
    bit in the V03. Is it enough or still too much wavy (i'm affraid of tempering
    too much because the bold letters have to get into each other and if i temper
    it too much i will not have materiel to get into the next letter. In a other way
    the font could be used for small titling and without the bold so i have to correct
    it anyway)\r\n\r\nit could help me to tell me wich letters are the worse and (if
    any) wich letter is okay"

  body: "There is just too much awkwardness where the curves meet the straight edges
    (for example the top of the right leg of your \"M\") on top of the mostly strange
    cuts in each of the characters (your \"O\"s for example) for the waviness to succeed.
    I think if you solve those first two awkward features, the curve of the characters
    might be acceptable.\r\n\r\nAlso, there's a weird mix of upper and lowercase characters.
    Why always a lowercase \"e\" and \"a\" with everything else uppercase? It makes
    them look huge. \r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "thanks for you comment penn, i have posted a new version (V04)  where i have
    deleted all the awkward angle. \r\ni had keep them because their was in the original
    SafeMail logo and was not sure how far i could from it. the 'a' and 'e' are lowercase
    because of the same thing, and i know for this point that the client want to keep
    it this way."

  body: "So you mean, this type was based on Myriad typeface, and your client want
    to turn it in to wavy typeface?\r\n\r\nI have hard time to connect the wavy water
    sport typeface, email, and the umbrella logo. They are a technology email host,
    and they support water sport, and they want their logo, typeface wavy like water?
    I think it's better to focus on either technology or water.\r\n\r\nI think the
    typeface so far is great, very watery and wavy. Your client like it, sound like
    a good thing."

  body: "Thanks for you comment anh,\r\n\r\nNo, i mean right now the client use a
    combination of Black/Standard Myriad in place of the typo i am in charge to design.\r\n\r\nSafeMail
    (the logo with umbrella) is a elaborate anti-spam & anti-virus system (that's
    why they wanted a special logo 10 years ago, logo who turns now into a typeface
    for all their products)\r\n\r\nFor watersport, DFi is just a sponsor (as you can
    see on their home page http://www.dfi.ch ) for local ships competition. They want
    their image to reflect that. At the time i made research for the first logo SafeMail,
    wavy form sounded original."

    the last version of the font in PDF, up there in the first post.\r\n\r\nI would
    love to have some critics that could help me enhance/improve the font. I have
    made a lot of changes in this lastest version of the standard italic that i have

    there is not much criticism because it is a very different kind of font. So most
    of us would not know what to say. I am not sure how helpful this will be:\r\nU
    looks too large and FT too narrow, no?\r\nG does not work: the horizontal bar
    is too high and too large, no?\r\nVW: why do they have one straight side?\r\na&e
    are very different! why?\r\nThere is something strange in the groin of your X,
    I fear!\r\n\r\nHTH, please let me know if it does not (& why)"

  body: "hey, hi, thanks for the post :)\r\nThings have moved a lot since my last
    post. A friend of mine who has a serious background in graphic design told me
    that my font was too wacky and too unbalanced in general, but the idea was good
    and original. So he spends some time to explaine me why and some grid technics.
    i had so many corrections to do, so i decided to start over and be less fantasy
    this time.\r\nIn the good news section, i convinced the client to forget about
    linking the typo of the bold font (hurray!!)\r\nso there is the new version of
    the typo, my friend tells me it's look a looot better.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo-V0_13_3695.jpg]\r\nwhat
    do you think?"
