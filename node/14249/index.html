Every forum has a few provocative people. Hrant is head and shoulders above the standard, he knows his stuff and he's one of the few willing to consistently post in the critique section. True, he picks fights with other strong personalities such as Nick, but so what? Leaving just means the voices you don't like will grow stronger. And ditto what Norbert said. You've been a regular member for nearly 3 years and this is your fourth post, why even bother announcing you are leaving? Why not just email the admins and ask them to nix your account?

This is not a "so what" scenario. It sucks and Hrant knows it.

You, Jared and everybody else here are enablers of a great community. Be proud of that. Nobody should get angry because they can't control the nature of the beast - that just weakens <strong>you</strong>. Control is over-rated.

What the f*ck does that even mean?

The question is who contributes more to this community than Mr. Papazian? For the life of me I really can't understand why people are so bothered by Hrant. Is it insecurity, or what?

If you don't like it, leave. It's that simple. I have enjoyed Hrants commentary, as well as Nick's comments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In reading fontsoldat's (Mathias') critique thread, I wonder if there's a misunderstanding caused by a language barrier. If so, it's an unfortunate misunderstanding since Hrant and Norbert both give positive encouragement for an interesting set of dingbats. 

Mathias, if you're reading this, you should know that Hrant and Norbert's compliments are sincere. I don't question Hrant's sincerity, even though I sometimes question his approach.

Hrant, don't be surprised that I mentioned you by name. I'm responding to Mathias' grief and grod's reply. Of course you are not the whole community, but it's an easy mistake since you're the most outspoken.

This in turn implies that we need to all get along or it isn't going to work. If someone wants to leave, as sad as it might be, we need to allow them that option without being rude about it. Be the bigger person. How can we possibly know everything? I've noticed that communicating online (ichat, email) removes the most important part of communication -- body language.
