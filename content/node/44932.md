  body: "You can't actually create a custom glyph. Rather, you move pieces closer
    together with kerning, perhaps with a spot of re-sizing and moving the baseline
    up and down. Done that a zillion times, for special accents and the odd math :-(\r\n\r\nYou
    can store most settings in Character styles; also (always mention your CS version!),
    in CS3 you can replace anything by the Clipboard contents. That's proven to be
    quite useful when there's lots of the same stuff in your doc."

  body: "Ah yes, CS3.\r\n\r\nI was searching all around for the answer and it wasn't
    looking good but I thought I would give it a shot. However this Clipboard contents
    may help, this is a large doc with a lot of occurences. Dang typeface with limited
    palette! Would love to change for utility purposes however . . . beauty/originality
    v. utility--the debate continues.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt answer."
