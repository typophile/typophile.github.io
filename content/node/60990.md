body: "If I have a font that has [[swsh|swash features]] that differ at the beginning
  and ending of words, how should I set it up in FontLab? I see that InDesign has
  swash as an OpenType option; should I use that and use some coding trickery to try
  to deduce whether a given letter is at the beginning or ending of a word? When a
  graphic designer chooses \"swash,\" does he or she do so with a single letter selected,
  or with whole words selected, expecting the font to know which letters should be
  ornamented?\r\n\r\nOr should I use two different stylistic sets, one for beginnings
  and one for endings? Or some other setup?"

  body: I would just use the Swash feature for global application to text, and the
    trick with the "ignore" coding to activate beginning and end glyphs.

  body: "My experience with fonts that have open type features such as these is that
    it's up to the designer to decide which type of swash or character to use on their
    own (by selecting individual characters). I have utilized the feature most often
    in Illustrator where there is an open type window with separate buttons for each
    of the kinds of alternates (contextual ligatures, swashes, alternate character,
    etc.) Fonts like Affair and Burgues by Sudtipos are set up this way.\r\n\r\npenn"

    along the way.
