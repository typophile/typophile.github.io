body: "If you ask a typographer about Old Style he will tell you something about Aldus
  Manutius and Claude Garamond and maybe something about humanistic handwriting and
  the italic. But you would not consider the following serif as classic oldstyle.
  \r\nIt is based on a tyoeface Giovanni Francesco Cresci wrote with a pen with an
  x-height of 8 mm. It was published in his book \xBBIl perfetto Scrittore\xAB in
  1570. You can also see it in Tschicholds \xBBMeisterbuch der Schrift\xAB.\r\nThe
  upper case letters are almost like the Capitalis Monumentalis. The lower case seem
  almost neoclassic and are very elegant. I only took the lowercase as a basis for
  Perfetto and wanted to keep the elegance and make a modern useful Serif. I started
  with the display version with thin hairlines and created the text version later.
  The display version has 9 weights with italics up to extrabold and ultrabold. The
  text version has only 7 weights, because extrabold and ultrabold make no sence in
  text.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming Pro version will have small caps, different sets of figures,
  some ligatures, Latin 2, turkish and baltic letters.\r\n\r\nwww.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/serif/Perfetto/\r\nwww.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/serif/PerfettoDis/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NewWassPerfetto_5322.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Perfettoweights_4306.jpg]"

  body: "Wonderful. I'd wish there were just the basic roman+italic+small caps.\r\nIt's
    a face I could really use, but I am constantly put off by big familes of more
    than 3 weights (or 6 variants)."
