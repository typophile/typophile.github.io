<p>First post in the design section, I feel WAY out of my league :).</p>
<p>Here' my brand new logo:</p>

<p>Which font would be best to use in a text that accompany this logo?</p>
<p>Thanks all</p>

<p>Your logo looks sort of techie and futuristic. Klavika, with its slightly angular lines, might be a good choice of typeface.</p>
<p>What sort of applications would you mostly have?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice, indeed Klavika looks likes a great choice.</p>
<p>What I meant by feeling out of my league is that I usually use the TypeID sub-forum, mostly for my clients, they are clueless when it comes to typography. I deal with communications through audio-video (video production) so fonts and typefaces are not usually of daily concerns.</p>
<p>When you say &ldquo;What sort of applications would you mostly have?&rdquo; I think you mean how will I use it? Well it will mostly be for official short contract or business offers documents that I will create and type myself, that is until I can afford a secretary :)</p>
<p>Do you think Klavika would be appropriate?</p>
<p>Thanks you very much for your time.</p>
<p>Phil</p>
<p>ps. Any thoughts you may have on the logo itself well be apprecited :)</p>

<p>By applications I meant things on which the logo would appear - a brochure, a website, a poster etc.</p>
<p>For business corresondence there&rsquo;s no reason why Klavika shouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>However, if you need to make a lot of powerpoint or html pages, then there probably is some wisdom in choosing a typeface that comes default with Windows. For instance, Trebuchet.</p>
<p>This is because such applications typically may have to be viewed in computers other than your&rsquo;s where something like Klavika may not be installed.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It will be used for business correspondence only. I already made the mistake of using a less common typeface (rage italic, my favorite) on my website and quickly found out that not a lot of visitors weren&rsquo;t able to view it correctly.</p>
<p>Any comments on my logo by the way, I read a few critics that you made in other posts and found them quite constructive. I won&rsquo;t take it personnal.</p>
<p>This design was inspired by the old movie countdown.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;d be happy to comment on the logo, but I think I&rsquo;m quite removed from your context. I&rsquo;ll just point out a few things that are not very clear to me looking at your logo.</p>
<p>At first look, the language and composition of the logo look rather like a radio station. Is that intentional?  In spite of all that we say about thinking out-of-the-box, in my experience, most categories of business have fairly well defined looks. It could be a little disorientating for your audiences if it is very diferent from the visual language of others in this category.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what FPS mean (Film Production Services?). Again unless its universally known in your line of work, I&rsquo;d prefer to have a clearer descriptor. Also what exactly is teh name of your business: is it Production 24, FPS or Production 24 FPS?</p>
<p>Is Countdown the one on the moon mission? If yes, is that reference relevant to what you want to communicate?</p>
<p>The metallic effect is quite well-rendered. But if you&rsquo;re going to do most of your printing on your office printer, then better substitute it with flat tones. Unless again, it has a key resonance that I&rsquo;m not seeing.</p>
<p>Will the logo always have the same blue background in exactly the same proportions, or have you also created a straight version (on white background)?  On a letterhead, for instance, the latter may carry greater impact.</p>
<p>The background colour itself looks a little muddy, at least on my not-so-state-of-art monitor. Try taking a print and check whether you want to tweak the CMYK values to make it a cleaner, crisper blue. I think cutting down on the Yellow would make it better.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s enough for now; I hope you&rsquo;ve learnt your lesson not to ask strangers to nitpick on your work ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Fellas,</p>
<p>Indeed that is what &ldquo;fps&rdquo; means. It is a cinema term, I understand when you say it could lead to some confusion but in the two years I had my company I think I never met anybody who didn&rsquo;t have a big question mark above their heads once I introduce myself and my company name.</p>
<p>The good thing is that it allows me to quickly teach them something, a real ice breaker. The question mark is usually replaced by a smile.</p>
<p>I do have the logo on a white background, it is this one that I use in my documents. Here it is:</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/logo blanc_5441.JPG)</p>
<p>Mind you this is not final, obviously some outlines will have to be added as the word &ldquo;production&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really stick out.</p>
<p>As for the muddy effect I don&rsquo;t think is has anything to do with your monitor, it is probably the low-res jpeg version I use to upload in this post.</p>
<p>When I say the inspiration was the old countdown I meant this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/countdown_5343.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t learn any lesson Arun I think everything you said was pertinent and well-founded. It is not my work but my designer&rsquo;s. I deal with moving images not stills :)</p>
<p>Anything you want to add feel free to do so, by the way a link to some of your work would interest me very much.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>Phil</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really good if your logo is a conversation starter. In that case you probably have a strong case to make 24 and FPS in the same size. I think it&rsquo;ll more readily evoke that initial curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I say the inspiration was the old countdown I meant this:&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel that reference is a little hidden. If you want countdown to be your concept then the cues perhaps need to be a little clearer. Probably just have the number within the circle device and have the rest of the text clearly outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you want to add feel free to do so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just spent a few minutes playing around with type, Do take a look:</p>
