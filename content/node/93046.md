body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm currently looking to purchase a complete family of Goudy
  Old Style including small caps and old style figures, and having had a look at what's
  on offer I'm going to plump for the Adobe versions. Browsing around fonts.com turned
  up two packages that on the face of it seem to offer the same thing, only their
  naming differs:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=215395\">Goudy
  Oldstyle Complete Family Pack</a>\r\nwhose fonts are named 'GoudyStd...' or\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=215392\">Goudy 1 Volume</a>\r\nwhose
  fonts are named 'Goudy Old Style...'\r\n\r\nSame price, format, number of fonts
  and features as far as I can make out. Am I missing something fundamental or is
  there no practical difference other than what names I'll be seeing in the font menu?
  I'd be curious to hear the backstory if there are any Adobe folk who could illuminate
  me.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n"

  body: "There is no difference between your two selections, the presence of both
    is indicative of some confusion in the way in which families and foundries are
    grouped on that version of Monotype's web site. You could try the beta version
    of their [[http://new.fonts.com/|new web site]], which is an improvement, or you
    could go through [[http://www.adobe.com/type/|Adobe's web site]] which is clearer.
    Alternatively, MyFonts lists these and several other takes on Goudy.\r\n\r\nYou
    could also consider the Goudy revival, [[http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sorts-mill-goudy|Sorts
    Mill Goudy]] released through the League of Moveable Type under the SIL Open Font
    License."

  body: "Karl, I did look at the Sorts Mill Goudy but the lack of a bold ruled it
    out for my intended use.\r\n\r\nJuergen, the Lanston package seems like good value
    next to the Adobe offering, and it has the long descender versions included. From
    looking at <a href=\"http://imap.typophile.com/node/85635\">this thread comparing
    the two</a> it seems that the LTC version is based on a smaller master than the
    Adobe one which would be more in line with the size I plan on using it at. It's
    also got lining, old style, proportional and tabular numerals.\r\n\r\nDecisions,
    decisions...\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to hear opinions from anyone who's used
    both."

  body: "Chris - The two groups you cite do not contain the same fonts. One contains
    a 'Standard' set and the other contains the 'Pro' set. \r\n\r\nFollowing is a
    quote from Tom Phinney on an Adobe Forum:\r\n\r\n\"All Adobe Standard fonts support
    the following languages: Afrikaans, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English,
    Finnish, French, Gaelic, German, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Norwegian,
    Portuguese, Sami, Spanish, Swahili and Swedish.\r\n\r\nAdobe Pro fonts support
    those languages, plus AT LEAST: Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian,
    Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian (Latin), Slovak, Slovenian and Turkish.
    Some Pro fonts have more language support than this, such as Greek and/or Cyrillic,
    and additional extended Latin.\"\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The P22 license says, \"The font may be modified if properly licensed for
    non-commercial or in-house use. The modified font software may not be sold or
    distributed.\" Which appears to be functionally the same as Adobe.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
    two groups you cite do not contain the same fonts. One contains a 'Standard' set
    and the other contains the 'Pro' set. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe two packages both
    have the Std character repertoire. Perhaps they represent two different OpenType
    conversions of the same set of Type 1 fonts, one by Adobe and the other by Monotype?"

  body: 'Well, aside from issues of economy (it always smarts a little paying Adobe''s
    European pricing), and the nice option of having the descenders as originally
    intended, the overall impression on the page was a bit more open with the Lanston
    version and, to my eyes at least, it has a bit more character. '
