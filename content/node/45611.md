body: "Any thoughts on Requiem for a wedding invitation?\r\n\r\nI'm just beginning
  to brainstorm for this project but I'm open to recommendations for sans serifs that
  might work well with Requiem. I'm a bit concerned that this font might be a bit
  too formal/elegant as a standalone font family for this project. Requiem is simply
  gorgeous and I'd be thrilled if I can pair it with a modern/contemporary sans to
  tone it down a bit. Any ideas? I'm trying to stay away from flourishes and scripts
  but am looking for something clean, modern and elegant. Maybe a sans?\r\n\r\nA separate
  thought is something along the lines of Aviano without Requiem. Clean, modern, sophisticated.
  I'm also very much drawn to Jana Thork but am not sure about the uncial approach
  for this project.\r\n\r\nI recently purchased Ministry Script for my own wedding
  invites and am thrilled with the results.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help that you can
  offer.\r\n\r\nJosh"

    know for sure, have to see. Throw in a sketch.
