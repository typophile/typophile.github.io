    to an O.\r\n\r\nDo you have any other letters?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    actually have the whole alphabet. I drew this as a companion for Futura.\r\nI
    just needed some direction on the lowercase. So I was wondering if it looks similar
    to something that's out there. I definitely had Luc De Groot's Antiqua in the
    back of my head as I was drawing this but I'm not sure if it even shows.\r\n\r\nI
    was being sneaky in posting this here. It definitely belongs to the Design or
    the Critique forums. Oh, thanks for the feedback on the Q. It put a smile on my
    face and some ideas in my brains.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, anything close or similar you
    guys can think of?"

  body: "I used my [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]] to look for the upper case key letters (EJKUMRW) and based on
    those your font is not a match for anything else in almost 1800 catalogued families.
    If you start dropping our less distinctive letters you begin to get some choices.
    One that was interesting was Artifex, by Gabriel Maeve, at Kimera Type.\r\n\r\n-

    looked at the typefaces much.\r\nThe g is very interesting. Maybe I should play
    on the original Renner g.\r\nThanks."
