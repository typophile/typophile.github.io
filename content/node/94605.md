  body: "Rainier: Completely off-topic question -\r\n  I went to glukfonts and download
    two zip files of the ZnikomitNo24 font - one for Mac and one for PC. They appear
    to contain the same otf font files, except that those in the Mac foler are only
    about 25%  of the size of the PC fonts. They have identical Open Type tables,
    identical hinting, and nothing I see that would differentiate them. Do you, or
    anybody else, have any idea about why there such different file sizes?\r\n\r\n
