  the font here - I thought it might be FUTURA LT BOLD OBLIQUE but it has a straight
  M's and a different lowercase 'a'. Then tried MUNDO but same deal, not the right
  lowercase 'a'. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.hollerforamarshall.com.au/StyleSheets/img/marshall-batteries-logo.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nGlenn"

  body: This is two different fonts. For "Batteries", you want Univers Black Condensed
    Oblique. For MARSHALL, I think that must be Futura Extra Bold Oblique, like you
    thought, but with a customized M.
