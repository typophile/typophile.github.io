  body: This appears to be a one-off monogram, not made using a font. You could make
    something that looks like this by modifying characters from a monoline Tuscan-style
    font with "fishtail" serifs, such as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/hessian/|Hessian]].

  body: "I agree with Victor that this can be made from a monoline Tuscan.\r\nThere
    is no perfect choice for the M. Hessian requires making a fishtail at the top
    of the strokes, adding a fishtail at the vertex,   clipping the medial spurs,
    and reducing the weight. \r\nIf I was using a font to make the monogram, I would
    choose \r\n1. Yuma Regular http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/otto-maurer/yuma/  It
    virtually identical fishtail curled back serifs to the monogram. All that is needed
    for a good match is to clip off the medial spurs, make the side strokes vertical
    and reduce the weight. Or\r\n2.  Lynchburg http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/lynchburg/
    \ It has virtually identical curled back fishtail serifs to the monogram. The
    main things needed are to add a fishtail at the vertex and reduce the thickness
    of the rhs vertical stroke and the lhs diagonal to match the rhs diagonal. Lynchburg
    is a much more precisely crafted font than Yuma.\r\nTwo other candidates:  \r\n1.
    Figgins Tuscan http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/figgins-tuscan/alternate_cuts.
    The main things needed are to add a fishtail at the vertex and reduce the thickness
    of the vertical strokes and the lhs diagonal to match the rhs diagonal. \r\n2.
    Old Vic http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/old-vic/ requires cutting off the
    terminal balls, flaring the vertex etc. \r\nMy comments on M also generally apply
    to the other letters.\r\nDon"

  body: "Most probably custom and by [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/50-Logos-Volume-3/13740025|Anagrama]].
    Too much geometric/symmetric/structured/adjusted to be a font as it to me and
    not the hardest style to reproduce actually as it's only made with straight strokes,
    circles and ellipses adding 'mustache' tuscan serifs. Another way to recreate
    it would be to start with some rather geometric like [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/copperplate|Copperplate]]
    (which looks not so far for this job) or [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/engravers+gothic/|Engravers
    Gothic]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/blair/|Blair]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/sackers+gothic/|Sackers
    Gothic]] mainly reworking terminals into tuscan serifs.\r\nInteresting substitute:
