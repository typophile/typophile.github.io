body: "Greetings, all -\r\nDoing a redesign of some corporate collateral, and looking
  for a nice Humanist sans with a full family of weights (especially condensed).  In
  the past, Myriad has been used, but I'd like to find something different.  In the
  design process so far, we're considering Meta Serif as our body text (that too,
  is open to suggestion), but are not quite sold on pairing that with it's Sans brethren.\r\n\r\nYour
  thoughts most appreciated... "

  body: I think you need to commit to one (be it sans or serif) before any useful
    consideration can be given to it's complement
