  for a book of poetry and also my fist try at it. I've filled in the recto page with
  some placeholder text just to get a feel for the actual text-block, since the poems
  themselves are centered. I wouldn't choose Perpetua for prose, but I think it really
  does let poetry breathe.\r\n\r\nPlease, do tell me what you all think.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAndrej"

    for poetry set up so the outer margin is, as is usual, the largest? I''m aware
    of an example mentioned by Bringhurst where this is not the case, but there''s
    unsifficient information regarding the actual way the poetry was set there. For
    if I set it centered as in my example above, the margins are in fact only imaginary
    (unless the lines were so long they would actually touch them on both sides).
    I was wondering whether larger outer margins were thus in fact causing a slight
    visual distraction, since they force the centered content to be visibly off-center
    with regards to the page as a whole.'

    books. And to that question I would have to say no; I usually make the pages the
    same. I.e. left page largest margin on the outside, right page largest margin
    on the inside. I do this because poems only have a straight left edge. Personally
    I think it looks best this way.  \r\n\r\nIn your example, I don't really like
    the fact that the poem is centered. I would probably make the left margin something
    like 30 to 35 mm. I just think it sits on the page more naturally that way.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    about the right page text block, is the book going to contain both text blocks
    like that <em>and</em> poetry? "

  body: "No, only poetry; I included the recto just to get a feel for the textblock.
    As for the centering, I've always been a fan of that. What I dislike the most
    are pages that are empty in a bad way -- like a single line of text in the upper
    left corner that just doesn't make any sense. There is, in my oppinion, a difference
    between emptiness and breathing space. I was trying to achieve a balance between
    the two. \r\n\r\nThank you for your input!"

  body: "If you are going to center the poem titles, they need to be indiviudally,
    optically centered over each poem. Finding the optical center from some poems
    (especially ones that have only one or two lines longer than the others) can be
    a challenge. Setting the poem title flush left with the poen text obviously avoids
    the extra work.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When
