  for a while and happily stayed in my comfort zone using Helvetica, Futura and other
  essential fonts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm now trying to design a corporate look and would
  like to really utilize typography to get it right.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIt's an IT
  company with a creative side so I'd like the types to reflect that, but not be too
  \"designery\" since they are still rooted in hardcore systems design.\r\n\r\nThe
  challenge is to find fonts that would work both in print/PDF and web (using font
  face). At the moment I'm leaning towards using PF Din Display Pro for headlines,
  most likely a light weight, and PF Centro Serif Pro for body text. My reasoning
  being that Centro is quite peaceful and sort of fades to the background while still
  being modern and fresh enough and DIN just looks nice as a headline font and is
  not Helvetica since I think I've overused it lately :)\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? My biggest
  fear is that the combination of DIN and Centro won't have enough tension, which
  would make the designs fall flat. Sorry I don't have any example pictures for you
  but I'm still in the early stages of wireframing and doing really basic design tasks
  but I'd like to get typography sorted early on in the design process.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nP"

    doesn't look that interesting to me. And I'm not sure how well it would go with
    Din. It would seem to go better with something like, well, Centro Sans. However,
    the combination might work very well.\r\n\r\nEven so, neither of these faces say
    \"creative\" or \"IT\" to me.\r\n\r\nHave you considered one of the bolder weights
    of [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100042|Ideal
    Sans]], which is solid but a bit quirky, with maybe something like [[(http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/warnock/|Warnock]]
    for text?\r\n\r\nA couple other suggestions for text:\r\nQuadraat\r\nScala\r\nSkolar\r\n\r\nSome
    suggestions for display:\r\nForza\r\nPossibly good old Myriad?\r\nQuadraat sans\r\nScala
    sans\r\nSeria sans"
