  one? Sure it looks custom-made. I'm not really looking for this one, but for typefaces
  that have that same script, bold and somehow, friendly look. Some starting point
  would be nice.\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

    to draw the 'connectors' yourself. I don't think these are very well executed
    in your sample, but nonetheless a nice idea.</em>"
