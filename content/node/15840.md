body: I have a client who still uses Quark (go figure) and says that my font is causing
  line breaks after two or three characters. There is no extra space between the letters,
  however. The cursor is moving out way ahead of the characters. Of course, the font
  works great everywhere else. Any ideas?

  body: "Christian,\r\nI thought that Quark was not yet Opentype compliant.\r\n\r\nBe
    sure you have exactly the same number in the sub list as the original list.  I
    don't know if it matters but you may need to put a dot between the letter and
    \"small as in \"A.small\" (I use A.smcp to match the feature name). Perhaps this
    helps the parsing asign \"a\" to \"A.small\"? \r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: On second look, I don't think that the OT stuff is causing the Quark problem.
    The hardest part is that I can't break it on my end. Everything works perfectly
    in Quark and everywhere else. Aargh. Any ideas why that code would cause FontBook
    to raise a flag?

  body: With an OT font, I think you have to do a kern feature. (I could be wrong
    about this though.) In the Preferences, under OpenType Export, try checking the
    box where it says "Generate kern feature if it is not defined". I don't know if
    this affects TT-flavored OT fonts and CFF OT fonts or just CFF OT fonts because
    I haven't done any TT-flavored OT fonts.
