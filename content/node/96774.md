    was active in comp.fonts and other discussion forums, he was very outspoken in
    opposition to intellectual property protection for type design, so rubbed a lot
    of designers the wrong way. It wasn't just the opinions that pissed people off,
    but the fact that they came from a tenured academic who can do and say pretty
    much whatever he wants without any consequences. It seemed too easy, from such
    a position, to make pronouncements about things that other people perceive as
    affecting their livelihoods.\r\n\r\nAs for his site, I've never found it very
    useful for the things that interest me, despite or perhaps because of its unselective

    to live, either.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, the wording of the poster you quoted began
    the process of confusing things.\r\n\r\nThe statement \"Artists deserve to be
    paid for their work\" (which I will refer to as X) has more than one meaning.\r\n\r\nTo
    say:\r\n\r\nP: <em>Artists should not have their work appropriated without compensation.</em>\r\n\r\nis
    <em>not</em> to say\r\n\r\nQ: <em>Artists are entitled to compensation for their
    creative work irrespective of whether or not there is any market demand for that
    work.</em>\r\n\r\nSo when someone makes the ambiguous statement X in a context
    where it is clear that person is asserting P, for someone to say that, no, X is
    false, because <strong>Q</strong> is false... begins the process of creating confusion.\r\n\r\nI
    think, though, that your post <em>continued</em> the process of getting things
    thoroughly confused.\r\n\r\nAn example of an opinion that avoids confusion might
    be:\r\n\r\nArtists do deserve to live, <em>and</em>, like everyone else, they
    deserve to be free from interference in their efforts to live.\r\n\r\nThus, on
    the one hand, they do deserve protection from having their work appropriated without
    compensation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if their work is not of interest to the
    market, the best they should expect from their right to live is to get welfare
    like anyone else, not to have the government support their art with tax dollars.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not saying one has to agree with that opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some Libertarians
    strongly support copyright laws, while followers of related political beliefs
    question where the authority to enact a copyright or patent law could come from
    (on the assumption that without a natural law right as its basis, such a law would
    be a government tax decree, not a protection against force or fraud).\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, non-Libertarians might see government patronage of the arts (but
    hopefully with <em>some</em> judgment of the quality of what is supported) as
    essential to a civilized society.\r\n\r\nI'm not even claiming the opinion given
    as an example as my opinion; I'm just noting that here is how one can debate these
    issues while keeping them sorted from each other."

    cannot be determined until they exist and are products in the market, then it

    of copies, and hence of income to the author. The reduction in capital expense
    that you describe affects who may publish and how, which is a good thing, and

    this business model would result in grossly inadequate compensation for creators,
    it is not quite as totally unworkable as your questions suggest.\r\n\r\nAfter
    all, people do get paid for, say, preparing the masters for printing ruled ledger
    paper, despite the fact that anyone can do it, so one could imagine novelists
    being paid on the same basis.\r\n\r\nThus, a society that saw novels as merely
    a way to promote the sale of newsprint, and which was content to have only as
    many works of real artistic merit as people might, as an amateur pursuit, make
    and give away for free, might feel entirely content to have no copyright laws.\r\n\r\nIn
    Canada, once upon a time, while music could be copyrighted, musical works weren't
    eligible for royalties until something like ten or twenty years after they were
    first published. Thus, while composers of works of enduring merit would be rewarded,
    those who composed ditties that were mere passing fads would not be.\r\n\r\nOne
    could easily imagine the United States, at some time in the 1950s, deciding  to
    adopt such a rule so as to destroy the music industry (this, of course, is before
    the RIAA had its lobbyists firmly in place) in order to save the nation's youth
    from the pernicious influences of that musical genre known as \"rock and roll\".\r\n\r\nSadly,
    artists and creators are not universally loved. But while musicians and composers
    are sometimes hated, the fate of type designers is more likely to be ignored and
    forgotten."

    in the way that you intended.\r\n\r\nOriginally, copyright was maintained by royalty
    to prevent the spread of seditious ideas.\r\nThat monopoly, lack of competition,
    and small runs of dull books, kept prices high.\r\nWhen copyright was redistributed
    to publishers in the 18th century, it created a boom in books by the early 19th
    century, with lower prices and mass readership.\r\n\r\nSee St Clair:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Reading-Nation-Romantic-Period/dp/052181006X
    \r\n\r\nHowever, that was within countries. Internationally, there was no copyright!\r\nThe
    work of Charles Dickens, for instance, while protected in the UK, was pirated
    in the US, prior to the international agreements mid 19th century.\r\n\r\nSo the
    argument that the pre-digital international copyright paradigm established in
    the mid 19th century was favored because of the large investment required in authorship
    and publishing doesn\u2019t make sense; it was political, driven by a sense of
    fair play. And Dickens\u2019 celebrity advocacy.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, Dickens\u2019
    tour of the US was like a rock star today; he was making no money from book sales,
    although they had created his fame. He was selling tickets to speaking performances
    of his works, which he delivered with great drama.\r\n\r\n"

    let alone what is just or fair, seems to me problematic, and certainly not grounds
    for just 'moving on'. I'm not wedded to intellectual property laws as they currently
    stand in particular jurisdictions or international agreements, but I am wedded
    to the idea that creative and intellectual works should materially benefit the
    people who create them, that this benefit should reflect the value generated by
    the work, and that this value should not be exploited by others without paying
    the creator. So there is no 'moving on', until there is a place to move to within
    which those considerations are substantively addressed. Until that happens, I
    expect we will see more, not less, heavy handed use of existing laws and, as a
    result, more concentration of intellectual property in the hands of corporations
    instead of individual creators, since it is the corporations that have the financial
    resources to take legal action against infringers.\r\n\r\nSimply stating that
    the business model of generating income from creative works will shift from the
    selling of copies to production doesn't cut it, and I say that as someone whose
    income is almost entirely generated from production already. The particular business
    model under which Tiro operates works for a particular kind of product and a particular
    kind of client, and I see no reason to assume that it is scalable to the font
    business as a whole, let alone to other kinds of creative works. Are corporations

    not be used to run illegitimate software aimed at circumventing copy protection
    technology.\r\n\r\nAnd the idea that enforceability can affect what laws should
    be enacted is an old one.\r\n\r\nThus, Blackstone's <em>Commentaries</em> gives
    an example of how armed robbery had the death penalty in France, but a lesser
    penalty in England - and, as a result, highwaymen were actually deterred from
    killing their victims in order to make themselves harder to identify in England.\r\n\r\nThe

    is unfair, but it is still enforcement; see my comment re. intellectual property
    being concentrated in the hands of those able to pay for enforcement).\r\n\r\nWhat
    I have noticed in the 15+ years in which I have observed and engaged in debate
    on intellectual property, is that the people who argue that everything should
    be free tend also to want particular things, i.e. that they value certain things
    more than others, hence their insistence on the freedom of everything becomes
    simply the cheapest way to obtain the particular things that they want. Linking
    the payment for a thing to the purchasing of copies of a thing, or of licenses
    to use a copy of a thing, has long enabled monetisation of the actual value of
    creative works in the market, monetisation of how many people want them and how
    much. And this is what seems to me missing from the everything free model: the
    ability to capture value and monetise it for the creator."

    that it doesn't change the fact that a worker has the right to the fruits of his

    not the only thing; the fact that enforcement becomes more difficult does have
    to be considered as meaning that aggressive copyright enforcement could have a
    potential for intruding on our liberties.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean, though, that
    I agree that the Internet means copyright is dead - I just don't side with either
    extreme position on this issue, but instead I think both sides have a point.\r\n\r\nWhen
    it comes to the other old issue - labor versus capital - the reason why there
    is a popular demand to bring in welfare measures, in my opinion, is because we
    live in a crowded world where people who can't find jobs on the terms set by employers
    no longer have the option of going out somewhere and homesteading. This is also

    I do believe there are natural law rights to one's property.\r\n\r\nAfter all,
    without a right to property, it would be permissible to kill or enslave people,
    by taking away what they have prepared to sustain their lives, or the fruits of
    their labors.\r\n\r\nViolations of intellectual property rights, though, don't
    involve taking, only copying. They don't directly make the victim poorer.\r\n\r\nSo
    if I hear an interesting story, telling that story to someone else does not injure
    the original storyteller (plagiarism being a separate issue). If  I see my neighbor
    employing a better way to thatch his hut, doing likewise does not injure my neighbor.\r\n\r\nThe
    acts of copying which constitute copyright and patent infringement only become
    wrong when someone has expended the effort to innovate in whole or in part because
    of a prior agreement to reward innovation through letters patent or rights of
    copying. Because copyright and patent laws have been enacted, violating them becomes
    essentially a form of the natural law crime of fraud.\r\n\r\nBut if nobody has
    given people promises that their clever new ideas won't be copied, then they would
    have to initiate force to stop others from copying them.\r\n\r\nWhat does this
    mean?\r\n\r\nSince we <em>do</em> have copyright laws, it doesn't mean that piracy
    is not wrong.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Big Content refers to piracy as 'stealing'
    -\r\n\r\nthat's OK when they're talking to the general public for the purpose
    of telling them not to engage in piracy,\r\n\r\nbut it's genuinely misleading
    when they're talking to Congress for the purpose of <em>having the copyright laws
    changed</em> to provide more and better protection to content.\r\n\r\nIf copyright
    laws are an agreement by society to reward creators in return for more creations
    - then enacting them was a <em>discretionary act</em> by society, and there's
    no inherent moral obligation to extend those laws further (to make a longer term
    for copyright, to add new restrictions on things like tampering with your DVD
    player) if the costs of such measures are felt by society to exceed their benefits
    (in increasing or maintaining the flow of new creations).\r\n\r\nThe world doesn't
    owe artists a living for bad art - but it also doesn't even owe good artists a
    living: society at large isn't obligated morally to regard artistic creation,
    or technological innovation, as important or worth encouraging.\r\n\r\nWhile the
    obligation isn't a <em>moral</em> one, though, there's a very strong case for
    a <strong>practical</strong> obligation to do so, particularly in the case of
    technological innovation. (Or, if you prefer, an indirect moral obligation - one
    owed to the beneficiaries of innovation, not the innovators.)\r\n\r\n<cite>And
    please, if accusing 'John' of having his head up his arse, please clarify which
    John.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, I was the only one who referred to his 'wording'. So

    This seems to me the point that you are missing: the demand, even when expressed

    didn't say anything about government per se. Insofar as particular laws represent
    the social contracts by which people choose to conduct their life together in
    society, how those laws are arrived at  -- by government as most people commonly
    understand it, as an entity of state, or by mutual consensus or by dictat -- is
    mostly irrelevant to the discussion. We have laws, however arrived at, and the
    best of these laws seek to reflect, however imperfectly, what we communally sense
    to be our moral obligations to each other, and to balance the sometimes competing
    rights of different individuals, groups and society as a whole. The worst of our
    laws are expressions of arbitrary power, and serve as an indication that something
    is wrong with our polity, and <em>that</em> is where the matter of how the laws
    are arrived at become relevant.\r\n\r\nOne could frame the current discussion,
    as it relates to what is happening in the field of intellectual property law,
    as being about whether copyright legislation is (still) a reflection of a moral
    obligation to recognise and respect creative works as belonging to their creators
    -- and note that UK copyright law includes rights that are specifically identified
    as moral --, or threatens to become an expression of arbitrary power of what John
    calls 'Big Content' in collusion with a bought-and-sold polity."

    451 notwithstanding, though, how does using TrueType instead of bitmap fonts -
    bitmap fonts being used on systems with less processing power available, but now
    even tablets and cell phones have enough power that this doesn't apply to them

    thumbs is a design flaw? What an odd conclusion to draw\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb\r\n\r\nAwhile
    back, I undertook an experiment to establish a relationship with one particular
    squirrel. As an incentive to cooperation, I provided treats which the squirrel
    was not likely to encounter\u2014in this case, Turkish pistachios at ten dollars
    a pound. After a week, when I was fairly confident that the squirrel knew that
    I was his benefactor, I entreated him\u2014through various hand gestures\u2014to
    amaze me. Well, one gesture I tried\u2014I am not absolutely certain which\u2014encouraged
    him to do just that: amaze me. \r\nHe was in a crape myrtle tree with fourteen
    separate trunks, none more than a meter or so from its polar opposite. The squirrel
    proceeded to ricochet off the branches, with absolute precision, and at a very
    snappy\u2014and accelerating\u2014 pace.\r\n\r\nI normally do not use this expression,
    because it is so sorely abused, but this display was <strong>F*CKING AWESOME!!!</strong>
    After five or six times around, the squirrel paused for my reaction. Quite naturally,
    I bowed to the Master: Ninja Squirrel rules. I am fairly confident that any dog,
    witnessing this display, would give paws (ouch!) to the notion of ever again chasing
    a squirrel. OTOH, I would LOVE to have the squirrel repeat the performance with
    <strong>me inside the tree</strong>\u2014not bloody likely (s0 far), but a breathtakingly
    spectacular prospect.\r\n\r\nI might add, as a footnote, that my bow appears to
    have affected the larger squirrel population. My local squirrels no longer run
    away furiously when they see dogs on leashes; rather, they gambol off playfully\u2014perhaps
    to taunt the poor dogs. At least one of the local dogs has sussed out that I may
    be the responsible party: she has taken to barking at me from time to time\u2014which
    is unusual, because I speak Dog rather fluently, and generally enjoy a quite friendly
    relationship with them\u2026"

    right.\r\n\r\nAs if the war in Afghanistan wasn't about bringing Osama bin Laden
    to justice for 9/11, and continues because it's about stamping out the Taliban
    to protect the Afghan people from them. No, it's all about becoming able to exploit
    their copper and other minerals.\r\n\r\nAs if the war in Iraq wasn't about how
    that country's regime, which was allowed to continue after being defeated in the
    war it started to invade Kuwait, hadn't defied the conditions of the peace treaty
    by hampering UN weapons inspectors seeking to prevent that rogue nation from gaining
    weapons of mass destruction - and continues because terrorists are menacing the
    ordinary Iraqi people. No, it's all about stealing their oil.\r\n\r\nAfter 9/11,
    any radical Muslim - by this I mean one that is willing to use force, not in self
    defense, but to impose either his brand of Islam, or subservience towards those
    who practise it, on others, instead of living side by side with them in peace
    and tolerance - should consider his days are numbered. So, just as Pearl Harbor
    was good news for the British, 9/11 was good news for the Coptic Christians and
    other minorities - as well as for Israel.\r\n\r\nIt's about ending an ideology
    that has proven itself a menace to the lives of Americans peacefully going about
    their daily lives, not about oil.\r\n\r\nAlso, your use of the word \"capitalist\"
    makes me wonder if you are confused about the horrors of the Soviet totalitarian
    regime - and how, therefore, the Arab oil embargo of 1973, inspired by that part
    of the world's petty quarrel with Israel, coming as it did <em>during</em> the
    Cold War, constituted treason against humanity.\r\n\r\nIsrael only expanded after
    the Arab world tried to throw it into the sea, and it was only founded - instead
    of Jews simply living as citizens of Palestine - because of violent attacks against
    Jews in Palestine. But in 1967, and again in 1973, the Arab world, instead of
    accepting the consequences of its wrongdoing, and leaving well enough alone, dug
    itself in deeper.\r\n\r\n<cite>The U.S. will, of course, lose this war, too: ask
    the British and the Russians\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's not as if the U.S. is trying
    to impose things on the Afghan people; it's fighting a very small band of terrorists.
    The <em>war</em> is already over, the Taliban have been defeated, and Hamid Karzai
    now governs Afghanistan; the U.S. is simply assisting the new state in dealing
    with a menace to order in its midst.\r\n\r\nPakistan might be the Taliban's Cambodia,
    but they don't <em>have</em> a North Vietnam."

    John F. Kennedy, America had a President who was what a President <em>should</em>
    be: on the one hand, someone who stood for the rights of minorities and women
    to equality, and who recognized the economic interests of the ordinary working
    man as vital to the nation, and on the other hand, someone who was a strong champion
    of liberty against the dictatorships which were hostile to the Free World.\r\n\r\nCompare
    that to the 2008 election.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Bush's statesmanlike and responsible
    response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (he didn't go and nuke
    Afghanistan, like <em>some</em> people were advocating; he didn't even convert
    the Islamic world to Christianity at gunpoint as someone else advocated, possibly
    in jest) was met with howls of outrage by the Democratic Party. Bush had to be
    defeated, or the world was doomed!\r\n\r\nAnd so the Democratic Party, leading
    up to 2008, had a primary process in which the leading candidates were an African-American
    and a woman.\r\n\r\nIt's critical to defeat the Republicans, in order to prevent
    World War III, and instead of choosing a safe, electable candidate, you're going
    to indulge yourself in a long-shot attempt to make history?\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed,
    once chosen, Obama promised to irresponsibly pull America out of Afghanistan and
    Iraq regardless of whether or not that would lead to the terrorists taking control
    of those countries.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Afghanistan, though, he was honest enough
    to relent <em>before</em> the election.\r\n\r\nMcCain was narrowly ahead; some
    commentators speculated on the \"unthinkable\" - if another 9/11 happened before
    the election, he would win in a landslide instead of squeaking through.\r\n\r\nWell,
    it happened - just in the other way. The stock market crashed.\r\n\r\nThis pushed
    voters towards the Democratic party, the party of FDR - the party that cares about
    whether working-class Americans have jobs.\r\n\r\n<em>And then McCain was so out
    of touch that he did a Herbert Hoover impression in response to the crash...</em>
    noting that the fundamentals of the economy were sound.\r\n\r\nAmerica wasn't
    ready for a black President - but the perfect storm happened.\r\n\r\nBut that
    election was just an extreme example of what had been true in just about every
    election - Humphrey versus Nixon, Mondale versus Reagan - the voters are presented
    with a Hobson's choice between someone who will neglect national security and
    someone who will neglect the economy and the less fortunate."

    you have been fortunate enough not to receive any undue attention from the Department
    of Homeland Security, or any of its above-the-law operatives. Eights glorious
    days in a brainwashing facility\u2014patterned after those employed by the Chinese
    during the Korean War\u2014might change your mind on the subject. For me, the
    experience merely confirmed a few hypotheses which I had developed\u2026"

    am saying that an Independent Contractor\u2014masquerading as a police officer
    and working for person or persons unknown\u2014coaxed my apartment manager into
    filing three bogus charges against me, which resulted in my being arrested, brutalized
    twice, knocked on the noggin hard enough to cause my brain to bleed, then tossed
    into the Restricted Issue division of the Fairfax County Jail, with the intent
    of intimidating me, and, I suppose, to \u201Cchange my attitude\u201D\u2014precisely
    why, I am not certain, but the most likely reason is the <strong>major flaw</strong>
    in the ACH check-processing system which I accidentally stumbled upon, and then
    announced to the world. Well, okay, not the world: here and on Craigslist. Or,
    maybe, people just find me annoying: I don\u2019t know. In the process, my common-law
    rights were violated and my civil rights were violated. I will spare you the gruesome
    details.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court ruled that Independent Contractors working abroad
    are, essentially, above the law. Call me paranoid if you wish, but my experiences
    lead me to believe that some contractors working in this country operate as if
    the same were true on American soil. So, DHS is the most likely culprit\u2026IMHO.\r\n\r\n"

    league civil rights defendant litigating firms that would take on your case pro
    bono no probs. So, I'm sure you're going to tell us that you've retained a civil
    rights lawyer.\r\n\r\nAnd ain't it a little ironic - you talking about the rights
    of the Individual. Exactly what I've been talking about all along!!\r\n\r\n\r\nn."
