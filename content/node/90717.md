  body: Short for 11 point type on 14 point body. From the days of metal type, you
    could cast a character at a certain size on a body (base) of a different size.
    Then came to be used even when referring to leading added between lines cast on
    normal bodies.

  body: I worked recently in a Monotype shop where they were doing a project that
    required 1 pt of leading between lines. In metal type, there's no such thing as
    1 pt strips of lead, so they cast 10 pt type on a 9 pt body, and used 2 pt strips
    of lead. Yes, that means the characters slightly hung off the edge of the body.

    Do you mean, perhaps, that they didn\u2019t have any in your shop, or that they
    couldn\u2019t be used with Monotype (for some reason I don\u2019t know about)?\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s
    the relevant page from the 1923 ATF catalog offering 1 point leads in assorted

    not possible with Linotype, only Monotype (and foundry, I suppose, but I would
    think it rare to be cast with vertical kerns)."

    type metal (although a softer alloy, I think, so you could more easily trim to

    metal type faces did not usually have extenders that reached to the very top or

    (Hrant has chosen to coin a special term for this extra space.)\r\n\r\nFor the
    Linotype machine, this extra space had a prescribed minimum. I don\u2019t know
    if foundries or Monotype had their own standards for this.\r\n\r\nIn digital type,
    there is a virtual corollary to the body, but there is no physical constraint
    or requirement to keep parts within the bounds of the body. Different type designers
    take different approaches.\r\n\r\nAlso, since we're no longer stacking little
    metal blocks upon one another, the virtual body has come to have less and less
    technical significance. In Postscript Type 1 fonts, it was still pretty explicit
    (in the Ascent and Descent values). But with TrueType and OpenType, there are
    multiple values describing various vertical metrics, all used by different platforms
    and applications to determine vertical relationships.\r\n\r\nSo, these days, setting
    text without any explicit linespacing measurement is not necessarily the same
    thing as setting metal type solid and you may or may not get a value equivalent
    to the point size, depending upon the platform, software, and preference settings.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, if you explicitly specify 11 pt linespacing (or leading \u2014 however
    the app chooses to call it), then your application should definitely set it with
    a baseline-to-baseline measure of 11 points.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    point remains: anyone who attempts to use it in conversation with professional
    type designers will most likely find himself faced with blank stares.\r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t dispute the value of the overall concept within a consideration of
    general parameters. I\u2019ve just always engaged it from the other way around,
    such that there\u2019s little point to referring to that space directly.\r\n\r\nThe
    concept that I\u2019ve always used to approach this aspect of vertical metrics,
    and the one which corresponds to my historical meanderings, is \u201Csize on the
    body.\u201D That\u2019s how I\u2019ve encountered it referred to historically.
    That\u2019s how I think of it.\r\n\r\nSo, my approach to a new design idea is
    to think about the interrelationship of x-height, cap-height, ascender-height,
    descender-height, and overall size on the body (i.e., the sum of the ascender
    + descender and it\u2019s relation to the em).\r\n\r\nIt seems really simple and
    straightforward to me \u2014 how do I want to fit my design in the em? How much
    clearance do I want between ascenders & descenders when set solid? Which is usually
    also a function of what I consider to be the target size of my design.\r\n\r\nSince
    I usually also consider how I want to split this between the head space and the
    foot space (also terms I\u2019ve seen used occasionally, btw), a single new term
    derived from Latin for \u2018ankle\u2019 just seems silly to me.\r\n\r\n"

    where I got it, but I'm pretty sure it was from a \u201Cprofessional type designer\u201D
    :-/ sort of book. It might have been DeVinne.\u2019\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a normal
    French word, and I think the text was more likely one by a man called Fournier
    (his <em>Manuel typographique</em>, 1764), someone who could be called a \u2018professional
    type designer\u2019. <em>Talus</em> is the French for \u2018slope\u2019 or \u2018angle\u2019.
    He is writing about punches and matrices and metal type.\r\n\r\n\u2018Le Graveur
    a encore une chose essentielle \xE0 observer; c\u2019est de ne point donner trop
    de <em>talus</em> aux lettres, soit dans l\u2019int\xE9rieur par le Contrepoin\xE7ons,

    \xE0 mesure qu\u2019il s\u2019use, un \xE9paisissement desagr\xE9able.\r\n\r\nIn
    his English translation of Fournier Harry Carter makes this:\r\n\r\n\u2018There
    is another thing against which the punchcutter should guard, that is giving too
    much <em>shoulder</em> to the letter, either with his counter-punch or outside
    with his file. this defect gives the character an unsightly thickening as it wears
    down.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Shoulder\u2019 is Joseph Moxon\u2019s English word for
    the sloping profile of the punch.\r\n\r\nThe punch must have a sloping profile
    or you would never be able to get it out of the copper after striking it to make
    the matrix, nor would the type cast freely from the matrix. (But as Fournier says,
    if the angle is too obtuse, the type thickens up as it wears.) This profile naturally
    creates a slight distance between the face and the edge of the body of the metal
    type, and unless it is allowed to project outside the body in casting and is rubbed
    away (something that was often done laterally with round letters like o, which
    would otherwise have too wide a \u2018set\u2019) it makes a natural distance between,
    for example, the descenders of one line and the ascenders of the line that follows.
    Which is generally what the designer needs to allow for in order to avoid the
    clashing of descenders and ascenders.\r\n\r\n<em>Talus</em> is just the word French
    professional punchcutters like Nelly Gable use today for \u2018slope\u2019 when
    they talk about their work.\r\n"

    which can contribute a certain clearance between descenders and ascenders in two

    the term to be a bit of a stretch.\r\n\r\nOne might just as well describe the
    little bit of space between two v\u2019s set side by side as their talus, since
    this same slope would have also contributed to those sidebearings.\r\n\r\nBut,
    I suppose that in a day when <em>leading</em> no longer means the space between
    lines, but is now used to refer to full distance from baseline to baseline; and
    when <em>kern</em> no longer refers to parts extending beyond the boundary, nor

    problematic.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from Fournier\u2019s context, and from your further

    the difference between the two being the \u201Cdepth of drive\u201D (i.e., how

    as \"flat surface below letter; sometimes called SHOULDER\". He defines 'drive'

    that even in the days of metal type the usage of terms was not consistent.  \r\n\r\nMy
    French dictionary defines TALUS as \"slope\" or \"embankment\". (The shoulder
    of one's body is \xE9paule).  \r\n\r\nNow that the physical shank of the piece
    of type is gone, and the 'body' isn't privileged by being a physical thing, it
    seems hopeless to give the various dimensions one agreed-upon name. For example,
    in some circumstances, you might want to know the x-height in relation to the
    em. In others, the distance from the ascender to descender line, in relation to
    the em. In others the distance from the top black in the font (often an accent)

    edge of the face to the front edge of the shank\u201D.  A beard and a shoulder
    are different things, or so I should hope. \u2018Beard\u2019 was used in the period
    of the hand press for the projecting square edge of the type which could pick
    up ink and spoil the impression. So the projection was often trimmed or \u2018bearded\u2019.
    Later, with machine printing, \u2018bearding\u2019 no longer made much sense,
    so the square projection was given the name \u2018shoulder\u2019 (perhaps mistakenly,
    but just possibly because it was a name with typographical associations that was
    no longer in current use).\r\n\r\n\u2018Shoulder\u2019 in Moxon\u2019s original
    sense, which is how Carter was using it (and although Fournier had a word in French,
    he was clearly puzzled to find an English one for it), applied only to the sloping
    profile of the punch and had little (though still something) to do with the detail
    of the cast type. <em>Talus</em> may seem to be an archaic survival today in typographical
    terms, but I know that it is still current among punchcutters because I have often
    heard it used by Nelly Gable when she talks about her work, and her predecessor
    Christian Paput used it too. The word puzzled me and drove me to try to find out
    what it was that they were referring to. I was delighted to find that it meant
    something to Hrant and was therefore in a kind of current usage, even (via this

    the \"Manuel typographique\"\r\n(at the incomparable Clark library) I've only
    read it in Carter's translation*,\r\nwhere I presume the word \"talus\" does not

    unease* expressed\r\nby Kent, especially concerning the translation. To be fair,
    this is an expected\r\nbyproduct of the \"translation\" from 3D to 2D (as well
    the \"translation\" from\r\nthe movement -and necessary subsequent extraction-
    of a punch to a static\r\nvolume/shape) so we can't expect an immaculate mapping
    of terms across\r\nthree centuries. As Kent points out, looking at the Legros
    & Grant diagram**\r\none can see that \"talus\" might best be translated as \"neck\"
    (or \"beard\") while\r\nthe \"shoulder\" is not really produced by the punch;
    it's nice to consider how\r\nthe talus of the punch gets \"inverted\" by being
    \"subtracted\" from the matrix,\r\nessentially maintaining its shape*** but it
    might very well be that Moxon's\r\n\"talus\" could not have meant what we're talking
    about... On the other hand,\r\nsince \"talus\" no longer has a meaning in digital
    type, and we remain without\r\na good term for the internal blank space, I personally
    have no problem mildly\r\nrepurposing it.\r\n\r\n* Not that I value terminological

    Kent, do I remember correctly that we had a very similar talus/beard\r\ndiscussion
    a while back? I think I agreed with you back then as well, but we\r\nstill did
    not arrive at a usable term - which to me is the whole point. I do like\r\nyour
    \"clearance\" though (even if it does not enjoy the classiness of \"talus\" :-).\r\n\r\nOn
    a side note:\r\nIt's very interesting to realize that -in the metal days- a talus*
    seems to\r\nhave been needed only because of the neck (basically you needed some\r\nextra
    room from the face to the edge) while today the main reasons for\r\na talus are:
    following the metal precedents for expected size-on-body;\r\nand accommodating
    cap accents, a character range no longer optional\r\nin professional type design
    (while in the metal days those could simply**\r\nbe \"patched\" in, eating into
    the leading space, and only when needed,\r\ndepending on the language).\r\n\r\n*
    Here I'm using it in the/my digital-era sense.\r\n\r\n** Although not elegantly.\r\n\r\nDon:
    I do remember Gerald teaching us about paper spaces - I might\r\nhave even used
    some once when feeling particularly picky! But those\r\nwere used between sorts,
    not between lines. BTW, something else he\r\ntaught me was to put -very thin-
    sheets of paper <em>under</em> the type to\r\nelevate it slightly for a better
    impression*, for example when you have\r\na wide range of sizes in a single forme
    and the larger type needs a bit\r\nof help looking sufficiently solid.\r\n\r\n*

    In particular, there is an \"equation\"\r\n\r\n  corps (body) = talus de t\xEAte
    + oeil + talus de pied\r\n\r\nSince the \"interline spacing\"* (here the \"14\"
    in \"11 on 14\") is equal to body+leading, and since the \"talus\" are basically
    the slopes at the top and the bottom of the character in lead (where you can put
    ascenders and descenders, as is being said in the article), I must confess it
    is hard for me to equate \"talus\" with \"body+leading\". \r\n\r\n*(edit) Maybe
    I should have written \"baseline skip\" (<a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/TeX/baselineskip\">TeX
    baselineskip</a>) since it is the distance between two baselines, and not the
    distance between two lines of text of non zero width.\r\n\r\n"

    Meaning 1) of the Wiki article, which indeed stresses the obliqueness of the \"talus\",
    specifies that it is between the eye and \"\xE9paule\" (which is said to be the
    upper border of the character). Should we understand that with meaning 1),  \"talus\"
    corresponds only to  \"talus de t\xEAte\"? I find it unlikely, but I can't say
    more. Definition 2) at least gives the equality \"corps (body) = talus de t\xEAte

  body: "I just looked in Bringhurst and, on page 37, he writes\r\n<blockquote>\r\nEleven-point
    type set <em>solid</em> is described as 11/11. The theoretical face of the type
    is 11 point high (from the top of the <em>d</em> to the bottom of the <em>p</em>,
    if the type is full on the body), and the distance from the baseline of line one
    to the baseline of line two is also 11 points. Add two points of lead (interlinear
    space), and the type is set 11/13. [...]\r\n\r\nThe text of the book you are reading,
    to take an example, is set 10/12 \u2715 21. This means that the type size is 10
    pt, the added lead is 2 pt, giving a total leading of 12 pt, and the line length
    is 21 picas.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nSo, according to Bringhurst, the leading is not
    just the thickness of the lead strip added between the lines in lead type (as
    I measured it above) but it also counts the height of the lead characters themselves.\r\n\r\nHe
    goes on in his glossary, on page 327\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<em>Lead</em> [rhyming
    with <em>red</em>]  Originally a strip of soft metal (type metal or brass) used
    for vertical spacing between lines of type. Now meaning the vertical distance
    from the baseline of one line to the baseline of the next. Also called <em>leading</em>.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nFor
    me, 10/12 is still \"two points lead\"...\r\n"

    body: "Just to make sure I understand: \r\n\r\n1. Bringshurst's remarks imply
      that if no added leading is interposed between lines, and the type is \"full
      on the body\", then it would be possible for the ink of a descender to run into
      the ink of an ascender on the next line down.  So for full on the body type,
      either leading should be added, or typesetting must be done carefully to avoid
      connected ascenders/descenders, or you just live with such connections.\r\n\r\n2.
      Quineau's diagram displays a font that's not full on the body, since the \"vuide\"
      is present outside of the descenders/ascenders.\r\n\r\n3. Michael Boyer's remark
      about TeX baselineskip clarifies something I'd been wondering about from the
      beginning.  Therefore if I wanted to typeset 11 on 14 in LaTeX, I would set
      baselineskip to 14/11 = 1.2727 using 11 point type?\r\n\r\n(I started this thread

    by S\xE9bastien Truchet for the <em>romain du roi</em>. The heading to the plate
    reads \u2018Calibres de toutes les sortes et grandeurs de Lettres\u2019, meaning
    something like \u2018measurements of all type body sizes\u2019. The detail, maybe
    the first time anyone ever tried to show such a thing, gives you a diagrammatic
    view of a single piece of type, showing the \u2018\u0153il\u2019 or x-height of
    the letter, the length of an ascender and a descender, both of which, of equal
    length, are called the \u2018queue\u2019 or \u2018tail\u2019, and then, above
    and below the letter, a small \u2018empty space\u2019 or \u2018vuide\u2019 (modern
    French \u2018vide\u2019) which was left on the face of the cast type in order

    part of it got rubbed away when the type was dressed. Seems strange, since he

  body: "Michel, you put the 'talus de pied' as the distance from the bottom of the
    A to the bottom of the type body. If so 'talus de pied' will be different for
    an \"A\" and a \"g\", and thus is not one fixed number for a font. \r\n\r\nSo
    'talus' as you interpret it isn't very clear for what Hrant wants to use it for.
    Also James Mosley above refers to talus as a characterizing a *punch* and not
    a piece of lead type, if I understand him rightly. \r\n\r\nIt is also not clear
    to me whether 'vide' will be one number either, because often the lower case ascenders
    are taller than the caps. \r\n\r\nAs I said, all in all, I don't see the point
    of using traditional terminology that wasn't that clear in the first place. In
    digital fonts, what is clear and precise is that all fonts have a defined baseline
    and a defined 'em'. And if the software allows you to do one em of vertical space
    between lines, the space from baseline to baseline on paper will physically be
    the point size specified by the software. In a specification such as 12/14 the
    first number is the scale of the em to be printed, and the second the distance
    between baselines, end of story. \r\n\r\nIt does make sense to speak of a design
    being 'small on the body', giving a general and imprecise indication of how it
    fits on the em. But if you want to be precise, then you have to specify ascenders,
    descenders, x-height, caps, overshoots, accents, etc. etc. "

    for relentlessly chasing terms that happen to have survived from metal type into
    the different world that this thread is mostly concerned with. I won\u2019t go
    on with it for ever. But I originally contributed because I was fascinated to
    find that traditional terms like Nelly Gable\u2019s <em>talus</em>, which I hear
    her use when she cuts a punch in steel, are still in use. And yes \u2013 to answer
    your query \u2013 the <em>talus</em> is indeed seen right through the process,
    from the punch and the matrix into the cast type, and it normally produces a <em>vide</em>
    that makes for a slight inter-linear spacing in metal type.\r\n\r\nIn traditional
    typefounding, in which the steel punch is struck into copper to make a matrix,
    the strike naturally has the same <em>talus</em> or slope. Since the cast type
    has a sloping profile that exactly reflects the shape of the punch, it has a \u2018space\u2019
    above and below the face which gives it the slight built-in leading which seems
    to be the subject of the current debate. (In many traditional designs, the tops
    of ascenders and capitals align, but admittedly many current designers have gone
    back to the reduced caps of the <em>De Aetna</em>, etc., which provide some extra
    spacing between lines.) You can get rid of the slope in lead type if you want
    to by using a mould that puts the face at the edge of the body and rubbing away
    any surplus sloping metal from the casting. But that\u2019s a chore that\u2019s
    best avoided. As I said before, you do this laterally when casting letters like
    o to get them to fit well, but see what trouble Fournier made for himself \u2013
    in the example I gave \u2013 by doing this clumsily in the vertical dimension.\r\n\r\n"

    means 'slope', then that would naturally apply on the type itself only to the
    slope leading from the printing surface to the non-printing top of the piece of
    type. But there is often space between the bottom of that slope and the edge of
    the body of the type. The distance between the top of the face and the vertical
    sides would be the talus + the distance along the flat non-printing surface to
    the side of the body. And that would vary with the particular character. So I
    don't see a natural way to adopt the old terminology for *one* number characterizing
    the type face.  "
