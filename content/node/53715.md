  body: "In Czech, the h\xE1\u010Dek (caron) softents the pronounciation of a consonant:
    so 'c' is (roughly, I am no phoneticist) pronounced as 'ts', while '\u010D' sounds
    more like 'ch', 's' becomes 'sh', etc.\r\n\r\nFor sake of everyone's sanity, let's
    ignore what happens to 'r', it's a certain way to discover a non-native Czech
    speaker :-)\r\n\r\nprgr"

  body: "If I remember correctly, the Jan Hus's reform of the written Czech language
    in the 15th century concerned (among others) replacing multiple-letter combinations
    with diacritics. So 'cz' became '\u010D', 'sz' became '\u0161', etc.\r\n\r\nIn
    spite of his endeavour, we can still manage to string together four consonants
    in a row, as in a popular tongue-twister 'str\u010D prst skrz krk' (which, sadly,
    means 'insert finger through neck'). Very frustrating to foreigners ... would
    anyone care to elaborate on the number of possible successive consonants in Polish?\r\n\r\nprgr"

  body: "I remember reading that one motivation for reforming the Czech orthography
    so that digraphs like cz, rz, and sz were replaced with \u010D, \u0159, and \u0161
    was to visually distinguish Czech from Polish. I do like the h\xE1\u010Dek solution
    as it readily applies to other letters like d, n, t, z, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom the tongue-twister
    example above, I can see that it is indeed helpful to distinguish the combination
    <em>rz</em> as in <em>skrz</em> from <em>\u0159</em>.\r\n\r\nThat said, I might
    have the facts wrong. Can anyone confirm that <em>\u0159</em> was historically
    represented by the digraph <em>rz</em> as in Polish? Yes, I do know that in the
    current Czech and Polish pronunciations they are completely different.\r\n\r\nStrictly
    speaking, I think Jan Hus used dots above the letters, not the h\xE1\u010Dek.
    The current h\xE1\u010Dek form was introduced later."
