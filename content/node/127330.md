body: I discovered this font in 1996 in an old Macintosh eworld forum. I used it to
  produce newsletters until about 2000. I had it saved on my old Mac as a Truetype
  font. I was unable to transfer it to another machine, and I've been trying to find
  it ever since. It was then known as "XPSchooner." I am aware that there is a script
  font nowadays known by that name.
