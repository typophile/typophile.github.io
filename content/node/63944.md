  make banquet table cards in a 1919 style of lettering. I volunteered cause I knew
  if someone else did it, we'd end up with Comic Sans and it would irritate me all
  evening. \r\n\r\nWhat would a suitable 1919 font be? I thought of Belwe, Bolton,
  Bernhard Modern, or Windsor. Am I right? \r\n\r\nI also thought of a Rennie MacIntosh
  style, but the members might not recognize that at all. \r\n\r\nIt has to be very
  legible cause the lights may be dimmed, and some of the old-timers are past 80,
  so their eyes aren't what they used to be.  \r\n\r\nTHANKS in advance!"

  body: "Thanks, I love the Hill House. But most of the people at this event would
    likely have no idea it's a famous early 20th century style - they might see it
    as a bizarre science fiction sort of thing. \r\n\r\nI'd like to use something
    anyone would recognize as quaint American type. Maybe Saturday Morning Toast by
    Nick, which he says is based on the old Saturday Evening Post logo. But that is
    more 20s."

  body: Try Bembo, its historically accurate (a revival designed in 1929) but I think
    it will have a nice period feel and will be closer to 1919 than comic sans...

  body: It depends on the look you are after. But if you want to be true to the period
    (unless it's '70s or '80s), steer clear of the ITC revivals.

    - I'm not too worried about authenticity. The guests (who are not designers) will
    notice \"It looks quaint\" or reminds them of materials they've seen from the
    WWI era - they'll like it. \r\n\r\nNow if we were doing the 1940s, yeah, they
    might actually be familiar with that era.\r\n"
