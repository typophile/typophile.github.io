body: This is the first results of my screen font project. I've based my letters on
  a 14pt pixel grid to make the look well on a screen at a text size without any hinting.
  All suggestions will be very appreciated.

  body: It looks really nice & very legible in small sizes, but I'd like to see some
    text set in the font.

  body: "Do you mean it's base on a 14ppm pixel grid? a pixel grid can't be point
    based, since the pixel grid is determined using the point size in relation to
    the device resolution. (i.e, at 72ppi, 14point=14ppm, but at 96ppi, 14point =
    19ppm)\r\n\r\nCould you list the ppm sizes displayed in the gif image for reference?\r\n
    interesting work!\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "Yeah, you're right! I was talking about 14pt on a 72dpi screen.\r\nThe sizes
    displayed in the gif image are : 96pt, 72pt, 60pt, 48pt, 36pt, 30pt, 24pt, 18pt
    and 14pt.\r\n\r\nHere are two msn text samples at 14pt & 12pt :\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/14pt_5965.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12pt_5635.png]\r\n\r\nI
    think that the line height sucks but I don't know how to change it : s"

  body: "Very nice design so far.  I think it's quite readable---the idea of basing
    it off a grid is quite clever.  Adding some basic Postscript-style hints would
    make the stems cripser at sizes other than 14pt.  Of course, your sample makes
    it look like you don't need it, but since auto-generating such hints is pretty
    painless, it's worth trying it.\r\n\r\nI would suggest posting a pdf file.  How
    much of the design is tuned to the Mac rendering model?\r\n\r\nThe s looks like
    it's falling backward ever so slightly.\r\n\r\nIn your anobe picture, what are
    the blue letters?"

  body: "If it's optimized for 14ppem why are the stems not crisp or consistent \r\n(look
    at an \"em\") and why is there any subpixel action going on?\r\n\r\nBTW, a pixelfont
    (even in the looser sense of the term where the outlines are\r\nintended to look
    decent in print) shouldn't have any talus (internal leading).\r\nIn your 14 point
    sample the ascender-descender span is 13 pixels.\r\n\r\nSomething's not exactly
    snapping into place.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The main idea is to use no hinting at all. The font is just a school project
    and don't have to be perfect but just to have a leading concept. The blue letters
    in the anobe picture are the default fontlab backgrounds, they are not linked
    to the font itself and I just forgot to hide them while printing my screen. And
    finally this is not a pixel font but a pixel based way to draw letters, I'm trying
    to make it look decent at big and small size just by the way I'm drawing it. Anyway
    can someone help about the line height ?

    is\r\nnot as expected.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "for the line height, look at the values of the OS2>WinAscent and OS2>WinDescent,
    and also hhea>ascender and hhea>descender. One or more of these values may be
    set too small. Depending on the app you're using,  the value in OS2>sTypoLinegap
    may need to be adjusted also. \r\n\r\nAnother question though, (and I might be
    way off on this one...) If OSX  uses oversampling to generate graymaps for the
    screen, then drawing on a 14pixel grid might not work exactly, correct? I'd imaging
    there may be cases where the larger oversample size rounds differently then the
    base 14pixel grid drawing? I am thinking this might be why you're seeing some
    of the strangeness that Hrant mentioned. As I said, I might be wrong about that,
    I certainly haven't tested it myself. \r\n\r\nJason C"
