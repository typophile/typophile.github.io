<p>The posting message is relevant for those &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; where I posted because you could have font designer using a sub-forum at &ldquo;Critique&rdquo; forum using font software and interested in pro bono work.  There is not any &ldquo;room&rdquo; on this forum for hiring a designer and thus the posting was at the most frequented &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; where there were more messages.  Some messages posted get a nil response and even at a &ldquo;room&rdquo; where based on the forum name you expect responses.  Those postings thus should not have been deleted by the moderators based on the postings as a &ldquo;Service&rdquo; point.</p>
<p>How can anyone post the idea that a non-profit project / pro bono project is either (i) illegal (ii) illegal if new and not yet incorporated as an organisation (iii) illegal if abroad (iv) illegal if an organisation abroad and has different incorporation method not same as the system you have in the United States? (v) illegal if it is said that a project is a non-profit project / pro bono project?</p>

If you are claiming to be a non-profit, you’d better be prepared to prove legal 501c3 status. Claiming to be a non-profit when you’re not is illegal. Very few people will do pro-bono work for an organization without knowing what that organization does or even what it is is called.

<p>I take it you live in the United States. Not everybody does, you know. But 501(c)3 status is a specifically American thing. Many of the non-profit organizations in the world don&rsquo;t have that status, because they are based outside the USA.</p>
