  body: "Yes, sort of. When you are in the store, fonts viewed in the list have character
    set features displayed next to their names. Here an example of Adobe's Kepler
    to show you what I mean:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FEX-Kepler-Feature-Icons.png]\r\n\r\nKepler
    Std Light Italic Caption has the following OT Features\r\n1. An Adobe ISO 2 character
    set\r\n2. Ligatures\r\n3. Euro sign\r\n4. Small Caps\r\n5. Oldstyle Figures\r\n6.
    Fractions\r\n7. Ordinals\r\n8. Swashes\r\n9. Alternates\r\n\r\nIf you double click
    on the font's name, you can click on \"characters\" and look at glyphs by Unicode
    range. In the Private Use Range, you'll see (if you scroll) that the font even
    includes ornaments inside it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FEX-Private
    Use Area Glyph Table.png]\r\n\r\nYour fonts (i.e., when you are looking at fonts
    inside your Library and not inside the store) will not have have character set
    icons, of course, but you can still look through the fonts character sets and
    see if there are extra glyphs.\r\n\r\nYou will not if your font has Contextual
    Alternates that work almost automatically (like Zapfino Extra or Bickham Script
    Pro) unless the foundry has included such info inside the font's description field.
    If this is the case, however, then you can the font in question's description,
    or do a search or create a Smart Set, etc."

  body: There is however, unlike is a program like FontLab Studio 5, no "OpenType
    Preview Window" where you take type text, and click certain features on and off
    to see how they look.
