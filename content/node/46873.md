  body: "Hello, I have many letters that were hand-written in German with the Sutterlin
    font. These date from the early 1930s. Since this was the time when Hitler came
    into power, they would contain interesting historical information. Therefore,
    I would like to translate them, but I cannot read this script. This is also so
    because of variations in the handwritings.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.herobooks.com|\u201CHeroes from the Attic:

    in German speaking countries. However, they often also offer translation into
