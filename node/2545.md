body: Hi Typophiles, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m designing a logo for a downhill bicycle tour
  company. After much consideration, I chose Leviathan Black Italic for the typeface.
  Currently I&#39;m playing around with typesetting and could use some inspiration
  and feedback. Still in Black&amp;White/Gray scale and have yet to introduce shape
  elements until thoroughly exploring type layout possibilities. <BR> <BR>In terms
  of adding a brand mark -- the idea that keeps coming to me is some sort of triangle
  &#40;either isosceles with a wide base or equilateral&#41; which would represent
  the mountain as well as the company&#39;s stability in the industry. With the possible
  addition of a s-like bezier which connotes the winding roads and switchbacks riders
  enjoy throughout the ride.Other possible elements are a bicycle and/or sun icon,
  but I&#39;m leaning more toward the mountain only to keep it simple. The many iterations
  of the company&#39;s current logo&#40;s&#41; are all over designed and visually
  disorienting. I&#39;m still &#34;sitting for ideas&#34; in terms of marks, but could
  use all your excellent opinions and ideas about the typesetting at this point. Have
  yet to present  roughs to client. <BR> <BR>Thanks everyone! <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23114.jpg"

  body: Of the options offered here, I&#39;d have to go with the second from the top.
    I think the lowercase italics has more of a Hawaiian flavor. The word spacing
    needs to be tightened between the &#34;n&#34; and &#34;C&#34;. The caps also seem
    to be a little too bold in relationship to the lowercase letters. You might want
    to try lightening them up a hair. <BR> <BR>As far as illustative elements go,
    I guess the most obvious &#40;perhaps too obvious&#41; relationship is between
    the &#34;M&#34;s and mountains. A capital &#34;M&#34; looks like two mountain
    peaks. I would rather see something happen with the &#34;C&#34;. It looks like
    an arial view of a rider

    here is a possible direction implementing the &#34;C-rider&#34; using the current

    &#40;i.e. motion marks, angled road lines, curvy road, etc.&#41; it might work
    nicely. I rotated the &#34;C&#34; upwards because it implies climbing &#40;up
    a mountain&#41;. I&#39;m sure you can come up with dozens of similar concepts,

  body: Here&#39;s a few directions. Have at them. I&#39;m having trouble in general
    with this logo I think perhaps because the company name has SO long. Ultimately,
    it will need to work across media -- from a 250px web to 4&#34;-8&#34; lettering
    for vehicles and signage.  <BR> <BR>Scott - not having much luck with your clever
    &#34;C-rider&#34; concept. I can&#39;t seem to make it recognizable to viewers
    and maintain legibilty. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m searching for an elegant type solution,
    but have fears that the client might &#39;demand&#39; that there be a bicycle
    in the mix &#40;sigh&#41;. How to elegantly integrate such a complex shape still
    has not come to the overworked little gray cells. I can &#39;see&#39; the rear
    triangle of a bike frame in the top right example, but add the rest of the parts
    and the name becomes obscured. <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s the choice of typeface?
    I feel Leviathan is a good fit in terms of personality, but perhaps I need a condensed/compressed
    font to deal with the length/cross media issues. Don&#39;t make me use Hel Neue
    107 Cond Oblique! <BR> <BR>I implore the typoracle and fellow typophiles to come

    road, through dozens of switchbacks and hundreds of turns WITHOUT peddling at

    interest in the type treatment and there are balance issues. There is a great
    design lurking in this job. I&#39;ve seen the vans full of tourists dressed in
    blue and yellow space slickers sliding on to cruisers as the sun rises over Haleakala.
    Quite a sight &#40;the sunrise that is&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s my suggestion:
    <BR>I think the reason you like laviathan italic is because it has a nice &#42;bike
    logo&#42; feel. I think you might continue to push Maui and Mountain in a mountain/bikelogo
    direction, and contrast cruisers with a flowing hairline script. That will set
    up a nice contrast and provide interest. Something like this: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23646.jpg"

  body: ' <BR>Those are my top choices as well. Why? Not to oversimplify, but they
    look the best. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been partial to the lowercase Leviathan Black
    Italic &#40;#2&#41; letterformss from the very beginning. As Scott said earlier,
    they have the most &#34;Hawaiian flavor.&#34; The forms of the lowercase italics
    &#40;rounded &#34;i&#34; dot, one story &#34;a&#34; and rounded tails&#41; fit
    the personality of the brand and client: fun, friendly, professional yet casual.
    <BR> <BR>The same is true of Fariplex Narrow Black Italic. When I saw the lowercase
    forms, browsing through the Emigre specimen book the other night -- they hit me
    like a ton of bricks. They also fit the brand&#39;s personality very well ,perhaps
    even more so, in that they have a slightly more quirky less formal feel. Fairplex
    has that Hawaii &#34;Upcountry&#34; style, which is about country living and true
    aloha spirit with a pinch of old western flavor for good measure. <BR> <BR>More
    generally, both 1 &amp; 2 pair better with the script than the others because
    they provide more contrast and visual interest. Also, I do like how Fairplex leans
    a bit less than Leviathan. <BR> <BR>The question now is: does one let the client
    decide which face they prefer? Or do I decide, develop a few directions and then
    let them decide which of <i>those</i> they like best? <BR> <BR> -t <BR> <BR>Okay
    Scott, why 2 over 1 &#40;assuming 1 was you 2nd choice?&#41;? <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'That was my &#34;snap judgement&#34; &#40;my immediate reaction&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Taking more time to think about it, I definitely like the italic type better
    than the others, but the combination of italic and serif in Fairplex seems to
    compete a little with the character of the script. Leviathan offers just the right
    amount of contrast without competing. After reading your reasoning, however, there
    is some justification for the Fairplex serif, as it has a little more of a country
    feel compared to Leviathan. <BR> <BR>RE: Client Empowerment - I usually work with
    the client to define the problem &#40;project&#41;, then I develop the solution
    with as little client intervention as possible. This sends two very important
    messages to your client: &#40;1&#41; project completion is simple with you on
    the job because you get it done without requiring much from them, and &#40;2&#41;
    you are the expert and they can come to you for the answers, not the other way
    around. As always, there are numerous exceptions to this school of thought, so
    being that you are the only one who knows your client, you&#39;ll have to make
    a judgement call. My ignorant recommendation is to consider the problem as you
    know it, then make the font selection. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: Don&#39;t you think the two stacked words, with the Ms lining up is too distracting?
    Wouldn&#39;t it be more interesting to shift the words? Wouldn&#39;t it be nicer
    to use all caps in for MAUI MOUNTAINEERS since you are using a script UC/lc treatment
    for Cruisers? As the script is already so full of motion, should you use an italic
    for the MM? <BR> <BR>3 and 5 seem to be the best starts from where I sit.

  body: The reason I suggest 3 and 5 ... disagreeing with Scott&#39;s suggestion for
    an italic ... more contrast. By using a roman with a script, it allows the script
    to be even more dynamic.

  body: Scott - thank you for the diplomacy coaching! Sometimes it&#39;s just a confidence
    issue. Especially when it&#39;s the first project for a particular client and
    you&#39;r not sure how &#34;difficult&#34; they are. <BR> <BR>Tiffany, you make
    a <i>very</i> valid point about the roman providing more contrast and hence allowing
    the script to pop more. In regards to the stacked &#34;M&#34;s, I&#39;m going
    to play around with alignment and also using one large &#34;M&#34; for both words
    or stacked uppercase &#34;M&#34;s which are more interwoven &#40;ala Randy&#39;s
    sketch - see above&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a bit torn on this at the moment. I&#39;m
    going back and forth between the italic vs. roman at the moment. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    like Randy to chime in, as this direction is based on his concept -- which &#40;by
    the way&#41; favors uppercase roman &#40;i think&#41;. But then again he did suggest
    Fairplex Narrow Black Italic once I brought that face to the table. <BR> <BR>

    pushes that contrast even more. I think you will also be wanting &uuml;bertight
    kerning. Keep it simple. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy
