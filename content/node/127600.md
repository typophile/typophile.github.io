  body: 'I was momentarily shocked, and then, thinking about it, saddened but not
    actually surprised. After all, everyday experience tells us that people in general
    are often unable to spell simple words that they must read every day. Also we
    all know people who can''t draw an ampersand correctly even though everybody sees
    those every day. So it''s not that much different that they should be unable to
    draw a double-storey g even though they see those everywhere too. '
