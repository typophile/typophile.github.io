  can't afford to higher one), hence I'm keeping it simple. The name of the company
  is Good Winter. No matter what I do I can't seem to get the full word winter out
  and keep it uniform. So I might just keep it like this, It's only for the web and
  anyone going to my sight knows the name of my company. I really have no idea how
  I feel about this logo. Feedback, advice, critique, all are welcome. Thanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Good-Winter-Logo_5035.png]"

  body: I think what you are missing is a vision of what you want the logo to do for
    you.  Why have a logo anyway?  What will it add to what you are already doing
    (and what is that anyway, I can't even guess with what you've posted)?  Once you
    have a clear idea of what the logo will accomplish, then you can define how it
    will accomplish that and start making choices about how to design it.  This is
    actually one of the more important parts of a designers job, to create a brief,
    a document that outlines what the goals of the project are, what needs it will
    fulfill and what messages it is communicating.

  body: "Good call. That's probably why I have no feelings towards it at all. I sell
    mens clothing. I work with designers from the local universities, so a bit high
    fashion, but please don't let that imply pompous, haha anything but. The reason
    I would like a logo is to strengthen the brand image, and honestly just for the
    top of the website when it launches. It'll be a stand in until I can afford to
    higher a designer. I'm not completely foreign to design, but never done graphic
    design. I'm fluent in fashion design and photography. Anyway all and any feed
    back is much appreciated. \r\n"

  body: "I think you need to simplify your intentions for this logo. Don't think of
    it as something that will instantly give your business an image and a voice. You
    do that yourself with the way your brand talks and how you display and choose
    the clothes you sell. Especially since you aren't well versed in graphic design,
    I'd say you'll be better off creating a simple logotype that clearly communicates
    your brand name and hints at the style you're aiming for\u2014even something as
    simple as typing out the whole name \"good winter\" in the same typeface that
    you have \"good\" set in up there. \r\n\r\nThe best thing you can do for yourself
    is maintain consistency in everything you create. Keep things simple and in line
    with your vision. Once you can afford to hire a designer, you can work with them
    to create more of a complex voice and image for your brand\u2014one that will
    probably have developed since your company has had time to grow and find its niche.\r\n\r\nBrand
    strategy aside, the mark you have isn't a bad start. The weight of the 'W' is
    too thick compared to 'GOOD' (or vice versa). I'm not sure, though, that abbreviating
    only the 'W' makes much sense. I would probably either use both the 'G' and 'W'
    to form some kind of monogram mark, with 'Good Winter' spelled out as a separate
    logotype, or simply only use the logotype.\r\n\r\nHope that helps, and interested
    to see how things turn out."

  body: "Thank you Penn. Excellent advice, very good points. I know the companies
    image is strong. That's what I'm going to do, I'll chose a type face that I feel
    is consistent with my brand and put it at the top of the site.\r\n\r\nI've discovered
    threw years of practice the most detrimental thing I can do is let myself get
    bogged down by irrelevant details, especially when it comes to my business. My
    business has excellent customer service, and the image around the company is actually
    fairly established simply because I learned early on if I'm going to run a respectable
    business I need to keep my OCD tendencies in check, the only time my obsession
    serves me well is during clothing design time. \r\n\r\nNow as I'm taking my company
    online I'm forgetting my golden rule. Maybe it's cause I've recently found a LOVE
    for type and web design. Anyway thanks again for reminding me of good methods.
    If you'd like to check on the progression of my page, logo, etc, your more then
    welcome to at www.goodwinterclothing.com. Right now the sites under construction,
    my projected launch date is beginning to mid april. \r\n\r\nK, now that I got
    my little rant out of the way I have another question. How much does it cost to
    higher a graphic designer to design a company logo? I know, I know, this question
    is ridiculously vayge (no idea how to spell that word, auto correct isn't even
    trying, VAY-GUH), but any sort of ball park for a professional with credentials
    would be appreciated. "

    a student) to several thousand (an experienced pro) to tens of thousands (a large
    design studio). The bad economy has impacted the businesses of many designers,
    though, and that might work in your favor.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the services
    you receive can vary tremendously. Someone with a low price may spend an hour
    coming up with a few top-of-the-head ideas, and then email you final art as a
    JPEG, and that's it.  \r\n\r\nA more expensive designer may meet personally with
    you (if they are local) several times, spend lots of time coming up with concepts
    and refining them based on your feedback, design your letterhead and business
    card and get printing estimates and review the printer's proofs, maybe help design
    your website, and in general do a much more thorough and professional job.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're on a tight budget, hrant's idea of barter or a student might be a good
    idea.  "

    cost around $50, wouldn't it? From what I've seen few hundred dollars typically
    buys few concepts, several iterations over a selected concept and a vector deliverable.
    What you described would be an output of an Indian \"24 hour logo service\" outlet
    that's hardly even worth classifying as a graphics design."
