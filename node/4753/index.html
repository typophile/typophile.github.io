		<div class="commentbody">hector:  I <BR> <BR> think it may be unclear to the reader right now because the last line which you cant read at this size explains that Urban Voice can provides technical and social skills to people.  i think the size of the text should probably be bumped up! thnx for looking out <BR> <BR>I can agree andrew that the We Can! is small. I  tried every location and size and this seems to balance the piece, which was a beginning issue.  But I never thought to blow it up real big like you said. I tried it and actually like it. Sorry about the jaggies i was to lazy to open up ai.  Anyways, i know it could be improved but since its white my only question is.....will people be able to see it? <BR> <BR>also what do the rest of yall think.... <BR> <BR>Number 1 or 2</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gregory, I liked the headline small and black. First of all the top building is pointing to it. Did you ever get a drop of ink on a white shirt? Its the only place your eye is drawn. Its the same principle here, lots of light gray sky frames the headline. My only comment is why are you burying the point of the poster, for people in need to make the call. That line should be more prominate.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gregory, look at the shadow of th lower building it points at WE CAN! The same can be said for the top building. Its very effective. Can you try one more thing? Since you made the important contact info larger, could you increase the &#34;wall&#34; so you can create more white space between Bridge the gap and Urban Voice. You don&#39;t need all that building to make the point. </div>

Is he wearing a hood?  <BR> <BR>How about putting the &#34;We can help you...&#34; line in lowercase. If this were posted in a NJ Transit train &#40;which is where I do most of my poster viewing these days&#41;, the last line would look like IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII from your seat. And I agree with Daniel that there needs to be more white &#40;gray&#41; space at the bottom, not only between the Bridge the gap and Urban Voice, but between the contact line and the bottom &#40;especially if this gets put in holder of some sort&#41;. That&#39;s the most important part of the whole poster. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">hey all, <BR> <BR>I honestly have started to dislike this piece. I cant nail it for some reason. Its weird how when you come up with an idea early in the  process that sometimes its the hardest to finish.  Anyways, I do appreciate all the help.   <BR> <BR>I decided after all the feedback to tighten the peice more, I cropped it and put more of the wall that was suggested. thnx Daniel for the tip.  I feel that by increasing the size of the other images and text it kinda it helped the issue of &#34;we can&#34; being to small from a distance.   I also put the lower text in lower case so that it wouldnt get lost from far away. thnx Peter for the suggestion. as for the person its just a shot of a guy i took in the city.  I wanted the person to be ambigious . If I had time I would probably reshoot the whole thing and have him looking at the we can but I dont have the time.   <BR> <BR>I appreciate everyone&#39;s help. I am going to pring the poster tomorrow. Its due by 6 pm tomorrow. Iam still open to a crit. Id like to put this piece in my porfolio.  Do yall think its strong enough ? <BR> <BR>-Greg <BR> <BR>btw i need to check my margins on the lower text  they look a bit off. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36066.jpg" alt=""></div>

They generally relate to a specific environment or community &#40;usually wherever he&#39;s showing or is on residency&#41; and are distributed within that context. <BR> <BR>You can see some more by doing a Google image search. <BR> <BR>R <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Daniel. I still think  Ican do more to this. I  got an extension so I will try out some more things. My teacher disliked the placement of the &#34;we can&#34;. I tried to justify the location to her , but i dont know. Do you feel i even need the we can in between the buildings?She also suggested to tighten up the bottom text .  Iam sick of this piece.........I cant finish it. <BR> <BR>robert:  I checked out Jakob Kolding&#39;s work I really dig it. I was even more excited to see some skateboarders in some of his pieces. I all ways thought skateboarding was a major urban playground and this is  a message I got from one of his works.. Thanks for sharing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gregory try this, make the copy more proactive. Head: Bridge the gap in your life. Sub: Build your social and technical skills, call: 510.208.7360. The idea is the poster is talking to the reader, think of the famous Uncle Sam poster. &#34;I want you for the U.S. army.&#34; What my suggestion does is makes only two pieces of copy and you can separate the logo. I do have a problem with the person image, now you have time find a stock image that looks empowering not a victim. The idea is by making the phone call they can take control of their lives&#40;A group?&#41;. Once you have the new photo you should feel fresh about this project. Loose the &#34;WE CAN&#34; copy, that line is fine for a delivery service like UPS, but an organization like your client can&#39;t make that promise. Just some thoughts </div>
