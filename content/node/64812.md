  it Rapture this is also a university brief, the logo takes the colour from natural
  phenomenon like the Aurora Borealis, Green Flash, Supernova etc. let me know what
  you think :)\r\n\r\nOh there are 4 logos for the one company each logo has a different
  building in the world, since its an international channel i thought this would be
  an appropriate thing to do.\r\n\r\nTopleft\u2013 London (This logo will appear in
  GB, Ireland, Europe)\r\nTopright\u2013New York (This logo will appear in North America
