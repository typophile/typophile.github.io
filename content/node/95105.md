    on top that later got incorporated into the now Pgh Post-Gazette I believe is
    a custom Blackletter, and that goes back to before Times Roman.

    of the first companies that began to experiment in this way was Mergenthaler Linotype

    clarendon/ionic model from the 1850s. The name of the typeface was Ionic No. 5.
    \u2014 Ionic No. 5 was completed under the direction of Chauncey H. Griffith in

    based on an oldstyle model, postdated Times Roman.\r\n\r\nAnd that the faces such
    as Ionic No. 5, Ideal, Paragon, Corona, and so on, while designed specifically
    for <em>newspapers</em> by Linotype and Intertype, weren't made for just one particular
    newspaper.\r\n\r\nGiven the great expense of having a set of custom matrices made,
    it is not impossible that Times Roman was the first face made specifically for
    the body copy of one particular newspaper - even though I am far from confident
    that this is so.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, <em>magazines</em>, being printed on
    better paper, placed a higher value on their typographic appearance, newspapers
    being disposable. Thus, for example, Century Magazine commissioned the typeface
    \"Century\", which is important because it was the ancestor of Century Expanded,
    Century Schoolbook, and Century Oldstyle, all three of which are still in fairly
    common use at the present day (the last as a substitute for Alexander Phemister's
    oldstyle)."

    reason, I did not include the precise citation information with the file. If memory
    serves: I\u2019m pretty confident that this was written by Robert Nicholson for
    <cite>Linotype News</cite> (or some other Linotype house publication), circa 1950s.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a relevant excerpt:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Why is it that out of the thousands
    of type faces available, most newspapers are set in one of the five legibility
    faces?\r\n\r\nIt all began in the Governor\u2019s suite of New York\u2019s Roosevelt
    Hotel, early in the summer of 1923. The occupant of the suite, then a former governor,
    was Martin H. Glynn, publisher of the Albany (N. Y.) <cite>Times-Union</cite>
    from 1905 to 1924. His guest was C. H. Griffith of the Linotype company. [&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;]\r\n\r\nGovernor
    Glynn was one of the first American publishers to become interested in the physical
    improvement of the newspaper. He realized that at that time newspaper readability
    had reached an all-time low and he hoped to enlist the aid of the Linotype company
    in doing something about it.\r\n\r\n[&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <em>historical interlude
    about developments in newspaper printing technology and consequent decline of
    typeface performance</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;]\r\n\r\nIt was at the depth of
    this condition, in the early \u201920s, that Governor Glynn and C. H. Griffith
    sat down to discuss a remedy. The governor envisioned the necessity of getting
    away from the small body types then in vogue, and developing a new face of such
    merit that publishers would not hesitate to sacrifice spatial economy for something
    easier to read and more attractive to the eye. He suggested a type of darker texture
    and less contrast in thick and thin lines.\r\n\r\n[&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <em>discussion
    of subsequent exploration and development of Ionic No. 5</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;]\r\n\r\nBefore
    the new face was fully developed, Governor Glynn died. Nevertheless, the groundwork
    for a revolutionary movement, which was destined to sweep over the newspaper world,
    had been established through his initiative and wise counsel.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    in March, 1926, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company announced the introduction of
    Ionic. [&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;] Almost as soon as the first advance proofs
    of Ionic were shown, the Newark (N. J.) <cite>Evening News</cite> adopted it,
    becoming the first newspaper to use the new face. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t
    know if this meets your criteria for \u201Ccommissioned\u201D or \u201Ccustom.\u201D"

  body: "Hrant, re. Ensched\xE9: you are misreading the chart. The chart details the
    types held by Ensched\xE9 in 1908, but not necessarily originated by them, and
    the 'customer' column as you call it actually identifies the original foundry
    for whom the types were cut. Ensched\xE9 purchased the punches and/or matrices,
    sometimes many decades after the types were originally cut, often after they had
    already passed through other hands. So, for instance, Hermanus Uytwerf was a bookseller
    and typefounder who hired Fleischmann to cut types between 1729 and 1732. Fleischmann
    was Uytwerf's employee, being paid a weekly wage. For a period starting in in
    1732, Fleischmann went into business for himself -- lui-m\xEAme --, but then sold
    his business includes these types to another type founder, the Wetsteins, for
    whom he then cut a number of other types. Ensched\xE9 then purchased the Wetstein
    types in 1743, and much later in 1799 bought the earlier types that Fleischmann
    had cut for Uytwerf (which in the meantime had been owned by Ploos van Amstel).
    Directly for Ensched\xE9, Fleischmann cut two types in the mid-1740s and four
    quite late in his career in the early 1760s. Most of his types were cut for the
    Wetstein foundry. His name is associated with Ensched\xE9 because they ended up
    owning pretty much everything he ever made, but during his life he cut types for
    at least eight different foundries, plus his own. This is what is recorded in
    the chart in the big Ensched\xE9 book, not commissioning customers.\r\n\r\n[I've
    only checked the details on Fleischmann's roman types; there were also blackletter
    types produced under similar circumstances for various foundries.]\r\n\r\n"
