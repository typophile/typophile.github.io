    should be legit, I think.\r\n\r\nps. I just opened the font and it is the same
    copyright."

  body: According do Luc Devoye's page on <a href="http://luc.devroye.org/25001.html"><strong>Dieter
    Steffmann</strong></a>, his foundry was  called FontShop. I have a few fonts from
    him with "Copyright (c) FontShop".

  body: "Originally, Gabriele, Hans M\xF6hring, 1938 or 1947 (references differ) for
    W\xF6llmer Type Foundry.\r\n\r\nYves - Years after joyfully discovering the delightful
    font offerings of Steffmann, I and a more respected source have come to the conclusion
    - looking at points and curves -  that many, if not most, of his fonts were digital
    improvements to Opti fonts. Per the Devroye link that Michel provides, Steffmann
    himself states that, \"I am not a designer but I add missing letters to public
    domain fonts in order to get a complete character set and I hint the fonts and
    create new weigths ... \"\r\n\r\nOpti created nothing original, either. They were
    simply the first to digitize lots of pre-digital faces. And they're long gone
    as a business.\r\n\r\nNothing is ever black and white in this font realm, eh?
    Nevertheless, Steffmann's Gabrielle is the only digital version I'm aware of for
    this face and likely as 'legitimate' as you're going to get."
