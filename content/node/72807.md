body: "Hi folks-\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate some help identifying this distinctive serif,
  used on the artwork and liner notes for School of Seven Bells' \"Alpinisms\". It
  shares many similarities with LT's Kalix, but the A has a left cusp and the B has
  a gap between the vertical and the centre bar that Kalix does not.\r\n\r\nThere's
  also a \"ch\" ligature here, but it's possible that it has been customised.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Nick\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3586.jpg]"
