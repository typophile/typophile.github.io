body: I was wondering if anyone had any knowledge or experience with "apple garamond".  From
  what I have read it seems to not have been released publicly and a quality revival
  is no where to be found. It was something that I was looking to pursue, but didnt
  want to go full steam ahead, only to be abruptly stopped by a quality revival or
  even the existing typeface existing digitally already...

  body: "This is from Wikipedia, so the usual cautions about accuracy would apply:\r\n\r\n\"Upon
    the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, Apple adopted a new corporate font
    called Apple Garamond. It was a variation of the classic Garamond typeface, both
    narrower and having a taller x-height. Specifically, ITC Garamond (created by
    Tony Stan in 1977) was condensed to 80% of its normal width. Presumably, Apple
    felt that the existing ITC Garamond Condensed, at 64%, was too narrow. Bitstream
    condensed the font and subtly adjusted the stroke widths and performed the hinting
    required to create a font that was then delivered to Apple as Postscript font
    \"apgaram.\"\r\n\r\n\"In cases when the Apple logo was accompanied by text, it
    was always set in Apple Garamond. Aside from the company name, most of Apple's
    advertising and marketing slogans such as \"Think different.\" used the font as
    well.\r\n\r\n\"This typeface was virtually synonymous with Apple for almost two
    decades and formed a large part of Apple's brand recognition. It was not only
    used in conjunction with the logo, but also in manuals, ads, and to label products
    with model names.\r\n\r\n\"Apple has not released the true Apple Garamond font.
    ITC briefly sold ITC Garamond Narrow\u2014Apple Garamond without the custom hinting\u2014as
    part of its Apple Font Pack in the 1990s. A version of the font was also included
    under a different name in some versions of Mac OS X prior to 10.3 as it was used
    by the Setup Assistant installation program.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography_of_Apple_Inc."
