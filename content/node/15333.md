  i began taking Russian language classes in the 8th grade. I just love the culture:
  it is truly something that samples the best from its neigbors on the east as well
  as those from the west. I've been a typophile since right around the same time.
  I remember my mother purchasing a pack of fonts with (not our first) computer back
  about the same time I began taking Russian classes. I was fascinated with the little
  catalog of fonts and i've been inflicted with fontlust ever since.\r\nIt's no wonder
  that these two loves should intersect, but i'm afraid i've only been able to skim
  the surface of Russian type design. This is kind of funny to me because my full-on
  font design obsession was kick-started when my little bro asked me to write him
  a letter in Russian for a friend to translate for him and I started looking at [[cyrillic]]
  fonts. However, i was just looking at some free stuff.\r\nRecently, I've been trying
  to work on some Cyrillics myself and looking for Russian stuff and being blown out
  of the water by what I have been able to find. Firstly, [[Richard Kegler|Rich]]
  brought home a disk of Ukrainian lettering from [[ATypI]]. If you got that disc,
  be sure to take a look at it, some very intersting stuff on that one... Then I started
  searching the net and among other things I found the website of <a href=\"http://andrij.berdyansk.net/type/\">Andrij
  Shevchenko</a>, who long ago posted his own <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/3823\">Andrij
  Hand</a> to our critique forums here. Unfortunately, I can't find where to purchase
  this beauty, or I'd eat it up! Then again today I was searching and I came across
  a website for a Russian foundry: <a href=\"http://www.jtf.ru\">Jakolev Type Foundry</a>,
  which features a beautiful sans, a luxurious script, and a Paperback-esque revival
  of an old cyrillic type called Gnosis. <em>\u041A\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043E, \u0432\u043E\u043E\u0431\u0449\u0435!</em>\r\nAnyhow,
  so I'm scraping the surface... If you are aware of any other cool Russian type links,
  post them here!"

    AZ of all places, who knew?) and in college. I love Cyrilic and I'm fascinated
    by it. My first foray into it was a Cyrillic bitmap (you can find in the Typophile
    critique if you dig for it).\r\n\r\nWhen I left home at age 19 I left a collection
    of Russian posters -- pro Lenin posters, 1980s era anti-alcolhol public service
    posters, etc. Not any great Rodchenko posters or anything, but a nice sampling...
    Well, my mom was worried that I was going to go pinko and she threw them away!
    That still stings."

  body: well if you use the term "speak" loosely, heh. i can get by (i think) but
    when reading more complicated stuff i need to have my handy pocket dictionary
    in my hand. Yeah, took 2 yrs in jr high/high school and 3 years at BYU including
    3 months in St. Petersburg. I need to get back there some day. I like to think
    i have a bit of the Russian soul in me... i hope that's not to pretentious of
    me to say so.

    that I feel an affinity toward, even though, to my knowledge I don't have any
    Russian ancestry and I've never been there (sad, to admit it.)\r\n\r\nHrant, it's
    something I've added to my list of \"things not to do, now that I'm a parent\".

    live somewhere as opposed to being a tourist, then you become partly of that place.
    Your three months, coupled with your interest in their culture, was most probably
    enough, no matter what any \"native\" might say.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    it show up for Windows/IE users?

  body: Joe, i think your new blog software supports unicode, right? I'm such a slavo/typophile
    I have the Russian keyboard installed on my WinXP machine, so all I have to do
    is toggle and type. But what I actually did here was use the character map to
    select the charaters i wanted, copy and paste. (that was just as easy as hunting
    and pecking for me). I guess i should get a diagram of the Russian keyboard pasted
    to the wall in front of me so i can get that engrained in my brain.
