    code for it</a> on Github shortly.\r\n\r\n(Among other things - adding a single-symbol
    fallback font implemented as a Data URI internal to the page, that will make it
    easy to see characters that are specified in the test page's source but missing
    in the font that's currently displayed by the browser. A \"notdef\" fallback font
    I guess you could call it. Similar to the one built into this <a href=\"http://readableweb.com/latest-version-8-2-of-drag-n-drop-pangram-font-tester/\">pangram
    testing page</a>. (The font's name is declared as \"backdrop\" in the @font-face
    rule. It has too limited a character set and I'm not fond of the symbol it's using
    to indicate a notdef character. Soon to be upgraded.)\r\n\r\nBut I'm digressing
    before I even begin....\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to say was that, in my experience,
    the sample text for webfonts in HTML test pages should ideally use Unicode points,
    not keyed-in characters.\r\n\r\nWhy? Well, here is what happens when  the browser
    tries to interpret the page with the Central European character set:\r\n\r\nMenu
    selection:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CentralEur-inFFmenu_4705.png]\r\n\r\nMessed
    up output:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CentralEur-messup_4272.png]\r\n\r\nJust
    flagging a potential problem. \r\n\r\nAnd also - talkin' 'bout Diacritics - take
    into account the special handling required for the S/s commaaccent/cedilla, T/t
    commaaccent/cedilla. Uni points: 015E, 015F, 0218, 0219, 0162, 0163, 021A, 021B\r\nThere's
    a thread about that here on Typophile I believe. \r\n\r\nrich"

  body: ">Just use UTF8 :)\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. No page complete without specifying
    charset UTF-8 in the head.\r\nBut....\r\nMy understanding is that regardless of
    the charset specified, if it just doesn't seem to fit the content, the browser
    will take a guess at the codepage to use based on that content. I've seen it happen
    with my own eyes.\r\n(I've actually seen an alternate code page triggered by a
    web font - don't ask me how but I've got the screen shots to prove it.\r\nA Google
    font titled Atomic Age (which was recently re-done so the problem is gone.)\r\n\r\nThe
    only way I know to prevent either human error or an unwanted intervention by the
    browser, is to use Unicode.\r\n\r\nBut hey, that's just me. I'm picky that way.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the additional links.  Nice.\r\n\r\nrich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    overrides the document charset.\r\n\r\nAll great tips. (Although T&eacute;, isn't
    what you are describing the same problem as Pablo's 'b' listing, or no?)\r\n\r\nOne
    downside I see with taking this approach - what if you are distributing the page
    to others who don't have that kind of control over their servers and/or the technical
    expertise?  \r\n\r\nAnyway, to sum up:\r\n\r\nyou can take, if possible,  all
    the steps listed above,\r\n\r\nor.......\r\n\r\nyou can write the test text as
    HTML Unicode points using either the decimal or hex syntax. (Example: &amp;#21512;
    versus &amp;#x5408;)\r\n\r\nFor test pages where all browsers need to process
    exactly the same characters and testers all need to see exactly the same text,
    I think, in this instance, the principle of \"defensive coding\" favors the Unicode
    points. You only have to remember one thing - convert the test text to Uni.  Take
    that one simple precaution and after that, it can't go wrong - the browser can
    be set to use any old codepage and the test text will still render predictably.\r\n\r\nI
    rest my case.\r\n\r\n(BTW - I've had this kind of argument before and it's really
    rare that I change anybody's mind.* It seems to be very much philosophical. Everybody's
    got their own inner sense of what's important and even if they acknowledge the
    logic behind what you say, they still do what they've always done. Perhaps that's
    out of a feeling of \"the way I usually do it is good enough\", I don't know.
    Not an end of the world event,  )\r\n\r\n* However, I did convince web designer
    and author <a href=\"http://zomigi.com/publications/\">Zoe Mickley Gillenwater</a>
    - with words written right here on Typophile - that using the \"local\" descriptor
    in a @font-face declaration is poor practice!\r\n\r\nI take solace in the little
    things.....\r\n"

  body: Same or similar; I'm not sure. Remains a fact, though, that if the document
    header says "charset=utf-8" but the HTTP header says "charset=iso-8859-1", the
    browser will render the document as iso-8859-1 (aka Latin-1) unless somehow spiked
    to do otherwise. Caused me quite some scratching of head to find out why so many
    things looked wrong all of sudden coming from the bedroom LAN server.
