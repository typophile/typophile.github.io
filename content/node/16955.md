  some of you might even know it. it needs some refining, and i was wondering what
  you all think where to start.\r\n\r\nany comments on the type? readability? what
  sort of connotations does it have for you all?\r\n\r\nwhere would you head: going
  way retro? just cleaning up things?\r\n\r\nlooking forward to receiving your opinion,\r\ncheers\r\n\r\ncurtze"

    does it represent? What is the company? You gotta know what the problem is before
    you can solve it.

  body: I know the company so it isn't fair ( maybe ) for me the spill the beans.
    But Ithink it's a good logo for the kind of company it is. Could it be better?
    Sure. But it fits. Anybody object to my saying what the company does or what I
    think the logo suggests?

    a square around the circle?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid"

  body: "i know it's not easy talking about a logo without knowing what it represents,
    but i think it's still valid to find FORMAL flaws, such as the somewhat confusing
    initial letter. (thanks david)\r\n\r\nactually, it's a company producing power
    tools, with a long tradition, even claiming for themselves to be the inventor
    of the handheld power drill!"

  body: David is right it looks like two F's you need to connect the vertical stroke
    to the horizontal to make one F. Good power tool colors. The tagline is a throw
    away. Your competitors can say the same thing. Try to find a tag line that is
    clearly your clients advantage in the market (If you can)

    suggest taking only one\r\nbasic form. either the circle OR the square.\r\ntaking
    both makes them weaker as using\r\nonly one of them.\r\n\r\nhope it helps\r\n\r\nderya"

  body: "I'm not so bothered by the circle and the square thing, but if this was all
    in a cicular format it would probably be stronger.\r\n\r\nI agree on the F, I
    saw two F's in one, but I really like how the \"bigger F\" interacts with the
    circle.  \r\n\r\nI think this would look nice as an italic script, with some relationship
    between the stroke of the script and the circle.\r\n\r\nThis to me as a nice historical
    nod to it, like something CSA would make.\r\n\r\nThe challenge will be how to
    work in that tagline.  But focus on the logotype first.\r\n\r\nRecommend checking
    out some old hardware/tool/maybe even camera logos.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "hi all,\r\n\r\ni posted a pdf with preliminary tests for a rework of the
    logo. any thoughts are welcome.\r\n\r\nas of now, i would try to keep both the
    square and the circle, because i think they are very typical for it. also the
    horizontal top line of the F can hardly be left out. other than that, i feel it
    needs a modern edge without losing its heritage. check it out.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.simultanismus.de/logo_fein_1.pdf"

  body: "It may sound slightly harsh, but I dont think ANY of these type choices is
    any better.. <em>( In the end it just looks like a word set in a circle, set in
    a rounded square.. )</em>\r\n\r\nI think this may well be a niiice opportunity
    for hand lettering.. :) Maybe you should rather improve / slightly adjust and
    redraw / 'reletter' the original logotype lettering instead of choosing 'just'
    another typeface to replace it.?\r\n\r\n<em>( As of now, I would still prefer
    the original one over those others shown.. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

    body: "thanks dav - i very much agree with you so far, it's not getting any better
      yet.\r\n\r\ni think the circle/square thing can be improved by enlarging the
      circle or finding a different negativ/positive combination.\r\n\r\ndon't know
      about the hand lettering - i kind of like the vespa-retro type and i feel it
      could work in that direction with adjustments made."
