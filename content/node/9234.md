  both Adobe and Linotype versions and the problem exists in both. <BR> <BR>First
  of all, it&#39;s related to Flash, but I&#39;ve noticed something else... <BR> <BR>These
  fonts are always fine for print projects - no problems.  On screen, and I&#39;ve
  noticed this in Fireworks, there is extra space added to the kerning behind A, W
  and T.  If I turn on the auto-kern setting the problem goes away.  Simple enough...
  <BR> <BR>However, in Flash the problem doesn&#39;t go away.  I can not use Trade
  Gothic in a Flash movie - the kerning, as described above, is off on a few characters.  I
  can&#39;t alter any settings...and pretty much all my other billion fonts work just
  fine. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a font or Flash issue actually...I think
  it&#39;s my computer.  How...what...is there something I can do to try to get at
  this problem? <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;m currently running OSX 10.3.7 if it matters -
  the problem did exist long before this version. <BR> <BR>Thanks, v <BR> <BR>PS:
  we got the last two spots at bolditalic in Gent to see Karel Martens speak - whoo!'

    really Trade Gothic.
