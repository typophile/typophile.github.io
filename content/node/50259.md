  I don't want to use my name because it's difficult to spell. So far the best I've
  come up with is \"flourish\". I chose it for it's double meaning. \r\n\r\nHere's
  my first attempts at a logo. Is it too obvious a choice? \r\nI wanted to try using
  Emigre's Tribute font because it looks like there's some nice ligatures in there
  but I can't cough up the money for it now. Does anyone know of similar fonts families?
  I've gone with Mrs Eaves for now.\r\n\r\nFirst impressions of name and logo? Any
  suggestions for improvement?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flourish2_6654.gif]"

  body: "I like what you're on to so far. What I would say though, is that I think
    you should be a bit more subtle with the flourishes/flourish. The borders you
    have, I think, are just a bit too obvious. Try just the text, with maybe a subtle,
    unexpected flourish on one of the characters (as the ligatures alone may not be
    enough to carry the design).\r\n\r\npenn"

    you are going to use flourishes, use them in an organic fashion. Have them as
    an integral part of your key word. Make it a cartouche (sp?) as opposed to a disassociated
    (although pretty) bookplate.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? Good luck.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "So I've given these comments much thought. I agree that using flourishes
    with the word is a bit obvious. It seems difficult not to go there though. Maybe
    I should try designing it upside down so I stop reading the words and designing
    by association. As far as Michael and Paul's comments, I think you're making a
    valid point. My only problem is that I don't want to go completely organic or
    scripty. I also thought of bookplates with my former designs, and although I like
    them, it doesn't make much sense unless I solely did book designs. It's feeling
    a little too crafty.\r\n\r\nSo here's the problem. This word is just not lending
    itself to meshing in some flourish elements, unless of course I move to a font
    that lends itself better. But I just don't want to go in that direction...it seems
    too \"wedding invite\" or \"floral design\". \r\n\r\nHere's my one poor attempt.
    Unless somebody says otherwise I think I'm going back to the drawing board and
    choosing a new name. I'm actually starting to read it flour-ish at this point.
    Ugh! I hate designing for myself...it's impossible.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flourish3_6536.gif]"

  body: 'I quite like the direction this is taking. The "o" doesn''t seem to fit the
    rest of the design. It looks like it''s being hugged. The flourish you added to
    the "h" is simple and elegant. I believe that is what Penn, Michael and Paul were
    suggesting - having the flourish graphic as part of the logotype - not as a separate
    element surrounding it. Will you be adding any other text like "graphic design"
    or "design services" to your word mark? If so you should start incorporating that
    now. '

  body: "That last one looks like it was done with a couple generic flourish brushes.
    And Baskerville is, by nature, not a font that lends itself well to flourishing.
    \r\n\r\nI do think that your idea about starting over is probably best. If you
    can\u2019t actually flourish by hand, it\u2019s probably a bad name for a business.
    And the baroque/victorian flourishing trend is already on its deathbed, so you\u2019ll
    just end up needing a new name/identity in a year or two with this one."

  body: "James- Thanks for your input. The flourishing trend is exactly why I wanted
    to stay away from flourishes at all. But like I said in my above comment, it was
    hard to not go in that direction. The name was chosen mainly for its alternate
    meaning, to succeed, to grow. As in \"if you use me for design services your business
    will succeed.\" The embellishment meaning was secondary and more of a nod toward
    the design meaning of the word. \r\n\r\nBut, I think  you're right, I can't get
    it to go in the direction I want it to, so it's time for a new idea. It's coming
    off too dainty and crafty. I wanted to give it one last shot taken in the suggestions
    of others before I gave up.\r\n\r\nfyi- I was using Mrs Eaves (not that it makes
    too much difference), and I wasn't using a flourish brush.\r\n\r\n@everyone. Thanks
    for your help and comments. I'll post once again when I come up with something
    else."

  body: "\"the baroque/victorian flourishing trend is already on its deathbed,\"\r\n\r\nProperly
    applied to the \"correct\" product  any sort of flourishing will out live you
    and me James. One of the reasons devices such as flourishes come in and out of
    fashion is that they are overused or improperly used to excess. In this case,
    I think, it is ill advised and adds nothing to the product except a frame. First
    off, the elephant in the room is the OBVIOUS. Flourish on \"flourish\" is redundant
    and lends nothing to his desired (meaning) intent of the chosen word.\r\n\r\nPeter
    Thornton a British calligrapher one said... \"if you cannot flourish, do not prove
    it.\" I say, if the shoe does not fit, do not wear it!\r\n\r\nBefore we dismiss
    flourishing in the future I think we should take a hard look at the popularity
    of Zapfino and all the similar spinoffs! Nuf said?\r\n\r\nMichael"
