  but am wondering if it would be viable to do for night reading. maybe 14pt or so
  in short passages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards"

    or backlight signage. Guessing I can consider typefaces of this vein.\r\n\r\nLet
    me know your thoughts."

    my observations I think that, while possible, and not all that expensive, the
    effect is a very soft glow that tends to blur the edges of letters so that any
    extended reading becomes be difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: It might make more sense to simply lay down an area of phosphorescent ink,
    then print black letters on top of this area; alternately, print on black paper
    and reverse out the type, which should definitely be as simple as sans as possible...

  body: "The problem is that since radiation dangers have been recognized, except
    for using tritium in sealed vials, the phosphorescent substances used on clock
    faces now only glow for a short period of time after exposure to light recharges
    them.\r\n\r\nThe old-style radioactive phosphorescent substances were used in
    writing messages to secret agents during World War II, I vaguely recall reading
    somewhere."

  body: "thanks for the help everybody\r\n\r\nsorry i should have clarified that this
    is for a short run of children's books meant to be read without a nightlight\r\n\r\nbeen
    looking at sans faces that would bridge the gap between being readable for a child
    and also suitable as glow in the dark type. \r\n\r\nI was looking at this http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aviation/fiendstar/\r\n\r\nany
    other hints as to what might be a suitable face? I may modify one with the right
    EULA\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "The problem might be that the glow-in-the-dark ink will need to be exposed
    to light in order to glow. Might not work well in a book: how could all the pages
    be exposed to light at once? Will it glow long enough to make it through the whole
    book, reading in the dark?\r\n\r\nFWIW, my son had a \"creatures that glow\" book.
    The book was meant to be read in regular light, but it came with a poster of illustrations
    printed with glow-in-the-dark ink."

  body: 'Wonder if there is some way to have a clear front and back cover, and some
    type of tracing paper with glow in the dark ink for print? The ink can be activated
    by light with the transparent paper. The only issue will be blocking out the other
    pages text. Just thinking out loud... '
