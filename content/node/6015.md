  Norther, California area. Specifically in Arcata and the surrounding areas. Any
  information would be appreciated. Thanks! <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Hrant, I have a sneaking suspicion it has to do with  <BR>either a teaching
    position or a man. =&#41; <BR> <BR>All I know is they have beautiful trees up
    yonder.

  body: Or teaching positions to a man. <BR>&#40;Sorry, Tiffany, I&#39;m really sorry
    - I just had to.&#41; <BR> <BR>Stephen, you knew that Eureka is the biggest soft
    drug hub on the east edge of the Pacific, didn&#39;t you? BTW, for the highest
    offer-per-hour rate, try the steps of Daam square in Amsterdam. Ridiculous. <BR>

    about the area. '

  body: 'Hi Tiffany: <BR> <BR>I was working the Graphic Artists Guild booth at Macworld
    last week and we had several conversations over the course of an afternoon with
    graphic designers from the far northern reaches of California. I think the college
    in Arcata tends to foster better design sense than you might expect from a small
    city. I know some folks who&#39;ve finished design degrees at Humboldt State as
    well. It may be a place to start. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR>also in northern CA, but not

  body: Thanks Joe, <BR> <BR>Humboldt U was, in fact, hiring last summer. However,
    it was a tech/design position. Anyone who knows me, knows that I&#39;d rather
    get locked into a library over night than a computer store.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep looking though. Thanks again.
