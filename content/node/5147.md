body: Here&#39;s the entry from wikipedia&#39;s article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_design"
  target="_blank"> type design</a>. I thought it was pretty bare. Maybe anyone interested
  in here could help these guys out.

  body: 'minimal on the graphics is just fine. but i think it&#39;s a bit too minimal
    on info. if i knew what i was talkin about i&#39;d add sommat. maybe i will just
    so someone can go back and correct what i write. <BR>maybe some don&#39;t know
    what the wikipedia is. it&#39;s kinda like these forums, but others can go back
    and edit/expand what has been written. as it says at the end of the page that
    i&#39;ve linked to above, this article on type design is only a stub... it wants
    someone to add some more info. <BR>i&#39;m thinking a bit of history, maybe some
    different methods. I think this&#39;d be a great resourse, if only people would
    utilize it. '
