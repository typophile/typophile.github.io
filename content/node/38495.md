    perhaps the demographic has changed, and they are no longer interested in tourists

    That is not the point. The point is that the new logo rises only to the level
    of effectiveness typical of small to mid size asian business with limited interest
    in effectively communicating with an American audience. \r\n\r\nAn effective re-brand
    will resonate with customers and when it's a well recognized brand it often needs
    to be an extension of previous branding efforts. The best you can say is that
    the new logo wipes the slate clean an creates the opportunity to create new associations.
    But if thats what you want you are better of re-naming the business as well. This
    ID is neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree feel free to chime in."

    of its customer base is either too young to have taken a road trip in the family
    station wagon or not American and therefore wouldn't get the visual references,
    hence the decision to \"upgrade\".\r\n\r\nI wish they had found a way to work
    the original \"H\" into the new logo. I pass a Holiday Inn on my way to my beach
    house and I always smile at the logo. I'll drive straight by this sign and not
    even notice it's a Holiday Inn. "

  body: Another aspect of the old design is the color. The old Green ( not shown in
    this post) is a very Starbucks looking color - by today's associations anyway.
    Holiday inn may have decided that they needed to get out from under Starbuck's
    massive marketing machine's color space and colonize a new color space. 'Green'
    as in 'eco' may have been something they were attempting to imply too since it
    is fashionable to be seen as 'green' now irrespective of any reality.

    It just always looked tacky. The thing is, when you go to a Holiday Inn, the brand

    made, it is just a room. The new logo does not improve either the image or the
    product. It is fear branding. They are running scared and doing something in hopes
    things will improve. The economy is more the problem than the logo. The new logo
    sucks big time though. It is a non-brand and like a water soluble tattoo, will
    fade from memory with the wash. Pass them a green bar of Irish Spring Soap to

  body: "\"The thing is, when you go to a Holiday Inn, the brand reflects the product
    accurately. What you see is what you get. There are no promises made, it is just
    a room.\"\r\n\r\nThat's the opposite of what the original logo stood for. In the
    USA of the '50s there were no expressways, only highways. And there was no consistency
    for lodging on any of the routes. A very hardworking and smart man from my corner
    of the globe got frustrated after a long car trip with his family by this lack
    of reliable, consistent delivery of lodging services. So he created Holiday Inns.
    \r\n\r\nThe man was Kemmons Wilson and his Holiday Inns delivered a consistent
    promise. A person could travel from coast to coast or border to border and know
    exactly what they could expect with a stay at a Holiday Inns hotel. It was a new
    idea and the right thing at the right time. Car travel was beginning to grow exponentially
    and the national expressway system was just on the horizon. \r\n\r\nThe company
    did very well under Wilson's leadership. But he retired in 1979 and the company
    and its logo started getting mucked up since then. That's when the promise started
    to die. Since the mid-80s the company has been under the control of various big
    investment groups. This most recent tweak of the logo removes the last bit of
    that emotional connection that the brand represented. I honestly don't know why
    they bothered to keep the name because there is nothing of the original company
    or brand promise left.\r\n\r\nAs to the original sign, based on my casual interest
    in it over the years, I've asked many questions and heard that the founders wife,
    Dorothy, sketched it out and took it to one of the local sign shops for refinement.
    These signs were discontinued because of the big expense in maintaining them.
    That's a classic, yet stupid, \"it-looks-good-on-paper\" decision. The signs were
    far less expensive and a better branding investment than all of the TV and print
    advertising the company buys.\r\n\r\nAwkward and tacky? The logo and sign are
    classic 1950s Americana. So maybe it is awkward and tacky, but it's a fine and
    beautiful representation of the era it came from. Maybe it's like another awkward
    and tacky brand from around here during the 1950s, a guy named Elvis Presley. "

    Now I'd say it looks amateurish, which apparently it was. You can have a great
    company with a bad logo, but it's still a bad logo. There are great 50's designs
    of all kinds, including type and logos, but to this old pair of eyes, the Holiday
    Inn logo isn't one of them.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the fact the Chris and I grew
    up in the '50 probably means we are less impressed by the 'retro' vibe of the
    design. It ain't retro to us, just old. "

    awkward, tacky, amateurish. But I have to disagree with it being a bad logo. It
    was unique, distinctive and had lots of character. I've been traveling a lot lately
    and have gotten lost twice trying to find the hotel where I was due to stay. The
    new hotel signs are boring, bland and blend in with every other sign on the road.
    But you couldn't miss those Holiday Inn signs, just like you couldn't miss the
    big McDonalds arches or the Shoney's Big Boy. They worked. They worked very well
    for what they were intended to do.\r\n\r\nThis new version is much more refined.
    But it might as well be a logo for a soap, a soft drink, a landscape company or
    nearly anything else. It's boring, not unique, looks just like a million others,
    and therefore a very well drafted yet bad logo. It does smell good though."

    This new logo would work well in such places, once it gets engrained into our
