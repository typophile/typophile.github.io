body: I need a regular proportionally spaced roman typeface (not decorative) that
  when used to spell Black Institute on two lines flush left yields the most amount
  of space between the length of Black and the length of Institute. In the sample,
  because the word Institute has a number of narrow letters, that remaining space
  (A) is greater relative to Institute (B) using Courier rather than Times Roman.
  For instance, I'm thinking (hoping) there might be a face with the cap I and the
  lower case T designed somewhat wider that normal -- without the face looking monospaced.

    you a result without hunting for another face  '

    body: If I mess with tracking, the "color" of the two words won't match. I had
      actually though of letter modifications using a program like Illustrator to
      keep the integrity of the letterforms. (Widening the letters in InDesign would
      thicken the verticals.) But I thought I'd try for an existing typeface first.

  body: Before I suggested messing with tracking and letter width I played with it
    and if you are careful it does not create too much of a "color" problem. Less
    is more but it will give you a result if you watch out for too much difference
    - Illustrator is a good thought too - convert to paths and then only woden the
    parts needed to get you width.

  body: "Black\r\nInstitute\r\n\r\nGeorgia already creates a bigger gap than TNR.\r\nThe
    typeface you seek need to be a serif? There are some sans serif typefaces, for
    example, that have a slab-serifed |I|, which should widen the \u201CInstitute\u201D
    part."

    in the example merely to illustrate the point. The face I seek doesn't need to
    mimic TNR.\r\n"

  body: The Times sample you show has some bad kerning on the /t. Fix that and perhaps
    it will help a bit. Very few of the serif fonts I looked at differ much relative
    to Times without some manipulation. You may find it helpful to go to bolder weights
    too.
