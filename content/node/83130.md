  body: "I did some looking for this when it was first posted, and normally triangular
    serifs says \"Latin\", but I found nothing that seemed close to this.\r\n\r\nDo
    you have any more samples showing other letters?\r\n\r\nFrankly, the serifs seem
    like they might have been added on, including the serifs on the 'a', 'g' and 'r'.
    It looks like identical triangles may have been added to re-shape the letters.
    If this is possibly how these letters were modified, then finding the underlying
    font would mean trying to identify it from the counters, and general letter shapes,
    ignoring the serifs.\r\n\r\nI think that is beyond my skill, but it looks like
    a display face was used, considering the 'e' and the counter of the 'd'. I think
    I would look at heavy weight Bodoni's. The small upper g counter supports Bodoni,
    I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"

  body: I concur with Mike. What The Font suggests Ionic Bold as a possible starting

  body: "I think you're right Mike, I just put the sample through WhatFontIs and News
    706 came up, which is based on Aurora (for some reason that isn't available anymore),
    and the next closest was Corona. The counters and widths are pretty spot on for
    Corona!\r\n\r\nI don't have any more samples, it is from the book \"Art & Agenda\"
    by Gestalten."

  body: "I did a little test to see how it matches up, I think we could safely say
    this is an edited version of Corona.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5821.jpg]The
    Blue is the original specimen, the red is Corona, and the black is the overlap
    (I have stretched the g from Corona to match the heigh of the original typeface
    however)"
