body: "Hi all-\r\n\r\nI'm trying to decipher this font from a client's save the date
  card who wants to match it for the wedding. Not sure why they aren't sticking with
  the first designer, but whatever. I thought that the main font here was in the Bickham
  Script family but I'm not sure about the letters \"M\" \"J\" and lowercase \"y\".
  Actually, the more I look at it, the less certain I get. What's with the letter
  \"h\" at the end of \"Meredith\"?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be terrific! Thanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontID-1_5628.jpg]\r\n\r\nerin
