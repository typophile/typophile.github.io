body: Hello all. I&#39;m trying to identify the font that is used on the face of Bicycle
  playing card. I&#39;m assuming this is a custom font made by Bicycle. There&#39;s
  a free verison of it here... <a href="http://members.aol.com/fontner/cardchars.html"
  target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/fontner/cardchars.html</a> that is unfortunately
  not very good. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a another image for you to look at too... <BR>

  body: The card artwork is done by hand... Similar type? Look for slab serifs like
    Glypha, Rockwell etcetera. Start with a Condensed. Modify as required.
