  the FHA Eccentric French font form the Fontry...\r\n\r\nThe curves are vintage and
  the serifs are big. They're so big that for years I never had the courage to tackle
  this intimidating font. But when fellow signmaker Frank Smith laid the groundwork
  for this intriguing typeface by Frank H. Atkinson, I couldn't pass on the opportunity
  to take it from paper to keyboard. After all, at over 100 years old, I felt this
  alphabet had never been given a proper, digital treatment. More\u2026\r\n\r\nSo
  how did this face survive the last century? Well, for those who don't know the history,
  it survived in Atkinson\u2019s ubiquitous book, Sign Painting, published first in
  1908, the generational standard for anyone interested in sign-related type design.
  The layouts and lettering treatments in this book have influenced countless designers
  for more than a hundred years, but most haunting to me was this strange face with
  the big serifs.\r\n\r\nWell, I'm haunted no more. The work is done, the kerning
  is complete, and nothing but a mouse-click separates a very old idea from the modern
  world.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s wide, it\u2019s big, and with those crazy serifs, it is
  definitely eccentric-!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable from Myfonts [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontry/fha-eccentric-french/|
