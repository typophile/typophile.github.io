  <BR>Thanks //jb'

  body: This sure brings back memories. A few years ago I knocked together a set of
    heavy titling caps inspired by the FGK uppercase. I only used them once, and never
    extended the character set beyond the basic alphabet.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7698.gif"

    has done in his bitmap font.

    shear in there. <BR>The &#34;S&#34; rules. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Jared, you&#39;ve gone mad! But I do like the color this creates.  <BR>  <BR>Miguel
    may be right about the size, but then I think, much   <BR>larger and a bitmap
    is pretty useless anyway. Then again,   <BR>are you thinking about utility with
    this exercise anyway?
