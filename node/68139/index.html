I don't mean to nag, but I know there are a lot of really talented fontographers here. And I know that they occasionally apply their expertise toward constructive advice... And I've tried to be a part of this community, writing several lengthy critiques of others' work. So, what I'm asking is: I can has critique now please?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah yes. I knew someone would bring up Museo. I was going to nip it in the bud but I forgot :P

I discovered Museo 3/4 of the way into designing this font (Shocking, I know, since I now can't seem to escape it). I was kind of sad at first because the U A V, etc. are similar, but my font (really wish I had something else to call it) is a serious slab serif, whereas Museo is a Sans that bends into serif-like bits occasionally. Also, Museo uses geometric circles in its round characters (or close to) and has a much higher x-height.

I'd like some non-Museo oriented critique, but I think I will make a comparison chart...</div>

Biggest change was the Cap height, which I lowered by about the height of the serifs. Not a major change, but I think it made a major improvement.

The /M/ was altered a bit beyond that, making the slopes less pronounced. riccard0 probably still won't like it, but I had another friend urging me to keep it the same.

Numerous other small adjustments, mostly optical compensation, and added characters.</div>

Indeed, Albu<strong>r</strong>querque has been misspelt in the US ever since (according to urban legend) that station master put it up wrong on the station sign.

More seriously, I like it, though the <em>q</em> bothers me.  The point would normally go higher, but to parallel the <em>g</em>, you've placed it in the middle.  This makes it stick out like a thorn.  What about doing a stub on the descender?  It's quite common in Spanish to write the <em>q</em> with a crossed descender.

I agree with aliason about <em>h</em>, <em>n</em>, and <em>u</em>: but I think just be condensing the letters some you should be okay.  The serifs aren't creating any extra space on the outside, just there's still a bit too much negative space on the inside.

I'd probably also make the <em>A</em>'s spurs a bit bigger, in the smaller text they're practically invisible.  The only other thing is I'm not sure those punctuation marks quote fit the style, but I'd need to see some more complex quoting action to know for sure how I feel about it.</div>
