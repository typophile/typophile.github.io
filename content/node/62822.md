  or does bold text in most fonts become\r\n   more readable if some spacing is added?\r\n\r\n\r\n[^1]:
  I have a problem with peripheral vision so it might\r\n      very well be just me.
  \ However since my field of vision\r\n      is narrow I typically want blocks of
  text to be narrower,\r\n      not wider.\r\n/BP\r\n\r\n"
