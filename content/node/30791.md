    ONLY want to run Windows, then you might as well shop around as you're going to
    have more options with Dell and the like.\r\n\r\n"

    technically not legal to buy a laptop in the US and bring it into the UK without
    paying the import duty, but sometimes I order photography gear from B&H in NYC
    and pay the shipping and import duty and it still is cheaper. Boy B&H has grown
    since I last physically shopped there. "

    because I generally prefer Macs. So, you've seen it in action? Is it really comparable?
    I build my own Windows machines specifically for gaming, so I'm looking for real
    heavy duty horsepower. I gather the price difference is still steep and the advancements
    in card tech for Macs are a bit behind. If I can see Parallels and BootCamp working
    well, I may take the hit anyway. But I'm always interested in hearing about hands-on
    experience."

    my rig less relevant.{/geek talk}</em>\r\n\r\nI run all of that via DVI to my
    Apple 20\" monitor, which is a glorious way to game, let me tell you. I may never
    stop, as building the PC is a big part of the fun for me, and it keeps me up to
    date on the latest tech. However, if I could run HL2 on a macbook...oh, man would
    I ever love that. Also, my wife would love less computers in the house, but that's

    was for the case w/ power supply, RAM, processor, motherboard, graphics card...and
    possibly the wireless card, but I'm not sure. The rest I carried over from my
    old machine. Like you, I didn't keep close track. The first time I did it was
    quite some time ago. I think it was $600 or so, but without the case or wireless
    card. I try to build machines that have solid benchmarks and long-term performance,
    but are still below the insane premiums you pay for the absolute latest tech (like
    $500 graphics cards). Reading up on benchmarks has really helped me find just
    the right graphics cards to balance cost and performance.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/guides/buyer.ars\">Ars
