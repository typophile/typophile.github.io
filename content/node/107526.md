  railway flyer, probably from around the 50s/60s.\r\nNaturally I'd now love to find
  out the typefaces used in it.. \r\n\r\nAll I know is that the headline \"Simplon
  Express\" is set in [[http://www.linotype.com/109/Banco-family.html| 'Banco']] (designed
  by Roger Excoffon in 1951).\r\n I think \"GARE DE LYON\" and the other small cities'
  names are all in the same typeface \u2013 which looks a little bit like 'Vendome',
  only in sans-serif of course;\r\n\"BEOGRAD\" reminds me of 'Futura' or 'Neuzeit
  Grotesk', except in a more condensed version, and with a very peculiar \"R\".\r\n\"PARIS\"
  seems to be yet another typeface than the rest;\r\n\r\nAny suggestions from the
  experts? ; )\r\nThanks in advance for any hints!\r\nJulie\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simplon-express_s_6022.jpg]"

  body: "Same image considered in previous thread:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/105462\r\nAs
    you noted top line is Banco, designed by French graphic and poster designer Roger
    Excoffon and released in 1952 by the Fonderie Olive.\r\n\"Gare De Lyon\" and Dijon,
    Vallorbe e.t.c. match Chambord Condensed, also by Roger Excoffon 1945-51 and released
    in several weights and Italic by the Fonderie Olive. As far as I know Chambord
    has not been digitized. For a full alphabet specimen see Jaspert's Encylopedia
    of Type faces, 1970, at p. 259.\r\n\"Beograd\" is some version of Futura.\r\nI
    am not certain about \"Paris.\" Probably not digitized.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
