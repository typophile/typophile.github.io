  body: dr dre -- are you re-creating this poster? as this was hand-drawn we'll be
    hard-pressed to find a match. if you are re-creating you might just re-draw those
    few characters. Hoefler&Frere-Jones' Gotham Condensed could work if you raised
    the middle bars of the E. Hmm. Still,  not quite bold enough.

  body: "thank you for your help. a good match is actually enough, it's not to exactely
    rebuild the poster, but to create something similar. i search quite a bit for
    myself and found out that the 'E' and the 'M' never appear in the same font like
    on the poster... either the E is a good match or the M... nevermind, i can live
    with that =)\r\n\r\n"
