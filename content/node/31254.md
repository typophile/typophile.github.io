  and on there website, I suppose it could be handrawn? Feel free to suggest alternatives.
  Thanks in advance.

    discussion</a> at WTF. \r\n\r\nEDIT: As I see now, there ARE differences between
    Liana and Mr. Lackboughs. Sorry for that. \r\nEDIT2: Ah, Mike Y has also <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/9942\">valuable
    background information</a> on this font. So roostertypes has it as <a href=\"http://www.roostertypes.com/view_fullfont.asp?catalogid=19848&issingle=yes\">Lady
    Dawn</a>."
