  body: "There is a common misconception that logotypes are derived directly from
    typefaces. Many are custom-drawn by lettering artists, others are only loosely
    based on one\u2014or more\u2014typefaces. This is particularly true in the realm
    of consumer packaged goods.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone else will see a similarity
    to another typeface, but there may not be a match.\r\n\r\n"

    of crowd-sourcing is that someone else may have another, better suggestion for
