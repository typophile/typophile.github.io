<div class=commentbody>Me, Hrant? No -- it's an old Internet alias of mine, from another fandom. I created it when I was about twelve, in a fandom where such names were the style. I never meant to keep using it, but it blurred with icons, which blurred with typography. <br> <br>I'm a bit embarrassed at my presumption whenever I think of the supposed surname, so I tend to go by just Liana. Problem is, as soon as I register with that, about a dozen more Lianas pop up -- it's not a dreadfully uncommon name. <br> <br>I'm reluctant to relinquish the Goldenquill, though -- I suppose it does tend to stick in one's head, and I'd hate to start over again with a new name now. <br> <br>-- Liana</div>

<div class=commentbody>So how many semesters of typography does your design study program has? How are they oriented?(history, edition, design, etc) <br> <br>Mine has none, we studied type on the fifth semester, as part of the "Editorial Design" course. Very dissapointing of course.</div>

<div class=commentbody>We have a 3 year degree. We have, in all, 4 semesters <br>of "typography". It is taught in a bizarre manner. We <br>only have one (final) semester of "type design", but that <br>also includes type history and classification. In one <br>whole 16 week semester, including holidays. Up until <br>then it is just learning composition. I think it is a silly <br>way of teaching, because to learn the history, <br>classification, and design in one semester is too late <br>and not enough. It isn't really enough to foster a <br>broad, cohesive knowledge of type and typography. <br>And our tutors seem to actively encourage font piracy, <br>and get quite shirty when I ask whether they paid for <br>their fonts. <br> <br>Does anyone have any tutors who encourage ethics <br>in type? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Many people at my school are uneducated about type ethics, and there's a good ammont of font piracy that goes on behind the scenes. My professor's don't LIKE it, but they don't really make it a point to discourage it, they just seem to pretend it doesn't exist. <br> <br>Most people I know "do not see the value" (their words, not mine) in paying $150 for a font file that's less than 1mb. In most cases, there's no advantage in paying for a font licence opposed to just copying a file off a computer. Ethics? These people do not CARE about ethics, most of them are broke and are just trying to get through school. <br> <br>If you think about it, there really isn't any kind of reward for purchasing fonts legimately. <br> <br>Fonts not copy protected, and have no serial numbers/keys (like when buying photoshop, quark, etc). Many younger students in the program don't even realize fonts/font licences have to be PURCHASED. <br> <br>Typographers complain about font piracy, but foundaries have done little to stop it, or promote ethical behavior. <br> <br>That's my opinion anyway.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, I worded that a little awkwardly. <br> <br>What i mean is, for students, there's no positive renforcement for purchasing font licences vs. piracy. <br> <br>If i buy illustrator or freehand legitimately, I get a manual, installation CDs, etc. I can use my serial number to register and recieve updates, techincal support, etc. People who have pirated copies don't get these materials. <br> <br>Granted, purchasing a type family is different than purchasing software . . . hmm, now that i think about it that statement of mine IS really ambiguous.
