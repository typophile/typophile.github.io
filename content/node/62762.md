  was wondering if I could get some critique on the composition of the logo; particularly
  the kerning.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBen\r\n\r\n[[http://ctrlshift.com.au/topshelf.png]]"

    look good near with the openness between p's descender and l's ascender. The serif
    on the p descender also seems jarring within the overhead space of Shelf, to my
    eye.\r\n\r\nThis logo makes me hungry for [[http://www.americangoodies.nl/catalog/images/StoveTop.jpg|instant

  body: "I immediately thought of the [[http://www.tollbrothers.com|Toll Brothers]]
    logo (which made me think of Toll House Cookies - now I'm hungry!). Here is their
    custom font: [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontDev/tollbros.html]]\r\n\r\nI guess
    it was just the swashes and the capital \"T\" that made the connection in my head.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you can customize the swashes and/or the way things overlap more so everything
    is more integrated. Right now I am +1 for what eliason said - word positioning
    is not quite right.\r\n\r\nHere is a thread that I came across that has a well
    integrated swash-style logo. I kind of like the heavy weight they used: [[http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/189400/|Vanilla

  body: "Thanks guys, I'm not so much concerned with the similarity as I am with the
    composition. The branding (how I use the mark) will create the point of difference.
    I'm also from Australia, and have never seen those brands before in my life :).\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the feedback. Will keep experimenting."

    and not just because Thanksgiving is approaching. \r\n\r\nI like your lettering
    better, but it's just not different enough to be a new brand. I think you need
    a whole new direction, sorry.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/topshelf_6495.jpg]"

    have alike logos especially since one is for materials and the other food.\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    it looks good, very balanced. And I get the whole.. \"Top\" on top of \"Shelf\"
    thing.\r\n"

  body: I tend to disagree with the comparison with Stove Top. As I've mentioned before,
    I've never seen this logo/product before (I'm in Australia, and I'm pretty sure
    it's not on our shelves), and as MrKikkoman has mentioned, they exist in two completely
    different markets. Thanks for pointing this out to me, but I think it's time to
    move on :). The branding (utilisation of the mark) is where the difference is
    created, and going from the concepts I am working with at the moment, this isn't
    going to be an issue whatsoever.

- body: "Ah. I misunderstood. When you said you were \"from Australia\" I didn't assume
    you were still there. I took that to mean you were in the USA now and because
    you were raised elsewhere you'd never seen Stove Top Stuffing. My mistake.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    \"they exist in two completely different markets\" is not a valid argument, in
    my opinion. That's like saying people who work in the print industry have never
    been to the supermarket and therefore wouldn't notice. People who write/read/print/sell
    books don't eat, right? \r\n\r\nIt's not like you can make a logo for a bookbinder
    out of the Coca Cola script and not expect people to associate the two.\r\n\r\nI
    do concede that the Stove Top association is irrelevant in a country without Stove
    Top, but that doesn't mean it looks like a mark for a fine bookmaker. It looks
    like a food logo, as several people in this thread alone have seen - it reminds
    people of cookies, supermarkets, <em> <strong>and</strong></em> stuffing.\r\n\r\nIf
    this is solely a US reaction, obviously, you're ok. But I think it's worth asking
    some local designers before you submit it to the client....\r\n"
