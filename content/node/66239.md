  by swedish designer John Melin.\r\n\r\nOf course it looks and probably is some condensed
  futura, but there are details that don't support that as the whole explanation,
  for example the circle-o and some letters not being condensed.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n/Tomas\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/lunds_1.jpg]]"

  body: Thanks - but that code worked before (it's a known MediaWiki code), and if
    you have a look at the instructions below the input box below, it's still listed
    there as a valid input method.
