  body: "WhatTheFont says, ITC Golden Type is very close.\r\nP22 Morris is more rugged,
    but both do not have round i/j dots (while otoh in both the i dot is slightly
    off-center, too). Your K is  more like the P22 font. "

  body: 'It''s a bit similar but the dot over the i is too elliptic in the golden
    type. The closest font i''ve found is the 1470 Jenson Latin Normal or jensen Eusebiu.
    The Q is the hardest part  to match and also that the dot over the i isn''t centered. '

    by Red Rooster is based on a late-nineteeth century American copy of Morris, but
    doesnt't match your example either.\r\nWhere does your photograph come from ?"

    really understand the reasoning behind this assignment. Handing out print-outs

    a lazy teaching method."

    type designer for you to study. Below is the website of Olsson Fonts.\r\nhttp://home.swipnet.se/~w-10011/Tobbe/Tobbe.html\r\n\r\nYou

  body: "It was more of an assignment where you should look at the classifications
    of typefaces as a way of identifying them, I guess most of us used what the font
    instead(me Typophile). \r\n\r\nThe largest part of the assignment wasn't to identify
    the font but to look at how it can be used, different weights and how to get a
    hold of it and then present this on a a3 print out. This on the other hand will
    be very difficult because I can't get hold of any real information on this type
    and I don't even know how to get a hold of it. I guess I have to email Olsson
    and ask. I can't even use the font in my print out. \r\n\r\nThe only information
    i have found is in the two links above. It would have been easier if I could use
    the font and try it myself I guess.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows where to buy it or
    any information about the font I would be glad!"
