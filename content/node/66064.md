  with e-book experience who would be willing to take some time to talk with me about
  their experience?\r\n\r\n2. Can <em>anyone</em> recommend information, sites, readings
  &c regarding e-books that could help get me started.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    hardware.\r\nSeems like you're mixing the two.\r\nThis seems to be the year of
    the E-Reader. The Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas is chock full of devices.\r\nStart
    there. Seems like the quickest way to bring yourself up to speed.\r\nA slideshow

  body: "After doing a bit of looking around I'm starting to get some focus. Thanks
    to Richard's comment I now understand the difference between e-book readers (hardware)
    and e-book's (software). This may not be the correct nomenclature but the distinction
    is the same. To be more specific, I am interested in talking to typophiles who
    have: \r\n\r\na) Worked for publishing companies or as freelance book designers
    doing the design, layout and/or production of electronic documents designed to
    be read on e-book readers, be they iPhone or Kindle, to help me understand design
    and production pragmatics.\r\n\r\nb) Worked with companies that produce the physical
    devices themselves, to help me understand various technical capabilities."
