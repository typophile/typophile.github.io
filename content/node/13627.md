  and I'm looking for a good typeface to be used as a reading text. Very often 'Times-look
  a like's' are used, but we are looking for something with a bit more personality.
  The novel will be around 250 pages, so the typeface has to be very legible and comfortable
  for the eye to read.\r\n\r\nIt will be used in combination with my <strong>Nordic
  Narrow</strong> (www.characters.nl). This willl be the typeface used for headlines
  and the cover of the book. So if it would fit to that, it would be more than great.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have a good suggestion?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n<strong>Also

    appreciate the merit of the clever way it forms nice ligatures with b, h, f, i,

    it would create a big wordspace after every f-terminated word, which would look
    like a mistake.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you need that kind of OT ability to solve the
    problem, why not just have a contextual alternate \"f\", with less of a flair?\r\n\r\nThis
    kind of use of contextual alternates to improve clour and lessen confusion is

    facilitator of immersive reading. Our reading mechanism has no problem skipping

    its only real drawbacks are: when the leading is extra tight (a bad idea anyway)
    the wordspace can overpower the line separation, leading to the reading of a word
    on the following line by mistake; and it uses up the retina's acuity faster than
    necessary. \"Look like a mistake?\" There's no time for such conscious sensitivity
    during immersion.\r\n\r\nAnd don't forget: there is after all such a thing as
    too much even color; evenness is ideal for display, but can -and by display face
    designers, usually is- taken too far, like a luxury car that insulates you too
    much from the driving environment. By the logic of totally even color, one would

  body: "On further reflection, I think the difficulty with Quadraat I'm seeing in
    the LRB is caused by the justification settings: there is probably a \"minimun
    wordspace\" value of 85 or 90% which very occasionally results in tightset lines
    such as...\r\n\r\nEnoch Powell's rivers of blood speech, and\r\n\r\n...where the
    f gets a bit too close to the b. Obviously, due to the rare occurence of this
    kind of thing, it's not a big deal. Perhaps the only reason I notice it is because
    I'm aware of the \"faux ligature\" structure of the f, as it's something I did
    in Goodchild, another small x-height oldstyle. However, that too was designed
    for publication setting where there isn't even the luxury of a simple f_i or f_l
    ligature, so the structure of the f is crucial.\r\n\r\nPutting in an [f_space]
    positive kern to solve this rare circumstance would be a mistake, as it would
    damage the spacing in the majority of situations, where [f_space] is not followed
    by a tall glyph. \r\n\r\nAs the topic of this thread is a font for a novel, there's
    nothing wrong with Quadraat there, as the difficulty is caused by magazine-column
    justification.\r\n\r\nThe reason I mentioned Quadraat's tiny \"flaw\" is because
    it conerns an intriguing design problem.\r\n"

    the two low-tech solutions of an \"f\"-space kern or simply neutering the \"f\",
    it's obvious that the occasional slightly-too-wide space is less bad than damaging
    any bouma with an \"f\" in it (especially ones that end in an \"f\"). Unless of
    course you have a \"belief imbalance\" between boumas and even color; but in that

    talking about the problem of the generous ear in oldstyle faces, and the difficulty
    it causes when followed by tall glyphs. If one tries to solve it by making the
    ear of the f extra wide, wide enough to form faux ligatures, it can create an
    occasional problem, which seems to be most apparent when the face has a small
    x-height (like Quadraat) and when the justification setting includes a reduced
    wordspace value.\r\n\r\nTwo solutions, by glyph shape, rather than kerning, are:
    (1) a face like Galliard, where the ear has more of a ball on it: this seems to
    deter unwanted horizontal movement. (2) Palatino, where the ear is drastically
    narrowed.\r\n\r\nI'm pondering a third solution, hypothetical, which would be
    to use contextual alternates of the f. This is not much different than having
    ligatures anyway, because if you look at the f ligatures of most fonts, you will
    see that the ear is much wider in the ligatures than in the single f. So in effect,
    fonts with ligatures already have two widths of f in them.\r\n\r\n>it\u2019s obvious
