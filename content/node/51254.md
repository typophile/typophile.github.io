  not answering my question.\r\n\r\nOn my fonts Fontlab added the [[aalt]] feature,
  I never added it. Fine everything seems to work but what I've noticed is some programs
  seem to have aalt turned on by default making it so all calt's slashed zeros thing
  like that to be the default symbol even if you don't want them.\r\n\r\nWhat am I
  missing? Is it suppose to be on by default? Seems kind of pointless to be turned
  on by default."

  body: Check the glyph order. I remember I had the same issue. When an alternative
    form of a glyph precedes the basic form, some applications used the alternative
    form automatically. The improvement of glyph order (basic glyphs first, alternative
    then) solved this.

  body: "About glyph order, yes, I had this too once.\r\nAbout aalt -- actually FLS
    does not add an aalt feature when generating fonts. An aalt feature is added when
    <em>importing</em> a font back into FLS. You could use ttx or any other tool and
    search for \"aalt\" to find it's not there unless you added one manually before
    generating the font ..."

  body: "No I never added it. So maybe it's not there. There is no default substitution.
    After all it's default. My font order is Windows Code page. The alternates are
    way down at the bottom of the font. The defaults are not mentioned in the Open
    Type features at all really.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly the problem is swash glyphs are
    being used instead of the default glyph. Now I use Calt to apply the swashes and
    it works flawlessly in Adobe's\r\n programs like expected.\r\n\r\nNow that might
    not even be the problem. There might not be anything wrong with my font period
    but it seems from what I'm hearing is that the calt rules are not being applied
    properly in some applications. What applications I don't know. Everything I've
    tested it in it works like it's suppose to. Could be Mac applications.\r\n\r\nSome
    applications seem to be ignoring the substitution rules."

  body: "Calt is on by default in InDesign. You should use the \"swsh\" feature for
    your swashes and the \"zero\" feature for your slashed zeros as these should be
    turned on manually. Calt means contextual alternatives, and I would put perhaps
    a feature like this there:\r\n\r\nsub g j' by j.calt\r\n\r\nwhere the j.calt is
    a normal j but with a little smaller tail in order to be replaced ONLy when it
    meets a g on the left side."

  body: "That is the way I have it set up. It's a script font so there is beginning
    and ending swashes for words. There is even singles. It works as expected in every
    program I've tested it in. I also used swash but for more elaborate swashes.\r\n\r\nI'm
    using Calts ' feature to pick apart the words so only the correct letters get
    subbed, I'm also using ignore subs. Like it's working like it's suppose to actually
    he did give me the name of the program with the problem. Hang on I'll go find
    it.\r\n\r\nHe noticed the problem with this program:\r\nOSX 10.5 using the TextEdit
    app\r\n\r\nI never tested my font on a Mac. I don't have a Mac available to test
    it on. I never said my font would work on a Mac. It should but it's untested.\r\n\r\n"

    it, I guess.\r\n\r\nIs it working everywhere except in TextEdit on a Mac?\r\nIs
    that the issue?\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Adam\r\n\r\n\"Processing of \u201Ccalt\u201D in Mac OS X 10.5 is
    broken.\"\r\n\r\nThat is exactly the answer I was looking for. I was sure that
    there is nothing wrong with my font. Like it works on everything I tested it on.
    Seemed kind of odd that there is a few programs out there that I didn't test it
    on that are having problems with it when the vast majority of the programs, Even
    High end programs are having no problem what so ever. I never made a system up
    to get my swashes working I used documented examples to make it work correctly."
