body: "I wanted to create an elegant thin grotesque typeface for my own use and a
  collaborative project I'll be working on with a friend. I found some inspiration
  in Helvetica Ultra Light, Gotham, and Museo. I did try to combine the influences
  to create something with it's own unique characteristics hopefully (mostly in lowercase
  characters a,b,d,g,l,p,q,w).\r\n\r\nI've noticed that some of the diacritics have
  rendered really poorly, but I haven't quite been able to figure out why (they are
  barely visible in the PDF, some not at all in the screenshot below, but they show
  up fine in FontLab)\r\n\r\nI plan on expanding it to a  book, bold, and black weight,
  I just want work out the kinks in this weight first and fix the kerning (right now
  I've been manually adjusting in Illustrator)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thinweight_5442.png]\r\n[[http://bit.ly/qnKsE|PDF

    to me:\r\n- in @, there a lot of space above the \"a\" and very little beneth
    it... This could be a problem in small sizes.\r\n- lowercase q - I don't think
    it needs this sherif, it looks really weird to me. But that's just me:)\r\nKeep
    up the good work!\r\n- Filip \u0141ysyszyn"

  body: "I suppose the hook is used in order to avoid that p and q look mirrored.\r\nBut
    now b & q and p & d have the same shape (albeit rotated). \r\nHave you tried to
    place the hook at bottom of the p and at top of the q (which should create a nece
    pseudo ligature qu)?\r\nVery nice work, by the way."

  body: "You've got this geometric thing going on with the caps, and it works well
    there. The uppercase reminds me vaguely of Neutraface. However, the lowercases
    are of two minds. Some of them are based off of what looks like a perfect ellipse
    (most of the round letters). Others, though, have a humanist feel in the round
    parts (ahmnu, and to a lesser extent fjltr). I think the letters would work better
    with each other if they all had the same feeling. If you go with the elliptical
    idea, I think the round parts could be slightly more square. The humanist curves
    seem, to me, to work better with the serifs you have on abdglpqt, but perhaps
    not as well with your caps, which are more geometric.\r\n\r\nThere are also some
    curves that look a bit rough to me: BJPRSU, stu, and possibly a (depending on
    which way you go). For the B, P, and R, I would suggest making your horizontal
    straightaways a little longer. The J and U need longer vertical straightaways.\r\n\r\nI
    think it's fine that b & q and p & d have the same shape when rotated. They do
    in lots of fonts."

  body: "I was suggesting that the bowl of the g should look more like the bowl of
    the d--in your d, the stem stops the ellipse shape and makes it incomplete, and
    the g is the only letter where that ellipse is complete. \r\n\r\nI like the new
    serif structure in your latest set of letters, although I personally would leave
    the g with no serif (since all the other serifs are on the top left or bottom
    right of a letter). In the bowl shapes, though, I still see the clash that I was
    talking about before. If you drop a line from the top to the bottom extremum in
    your \"o\", it'll run vertically straight through your letter. If you stacked
    an \"n\" on top of a \"u\", though, and did the same thing, the line would run
    diagonal. That's what I'm trying to talk about.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the m and n I
    prefer the serif on the top left. I don't think the t needs a top serif."
