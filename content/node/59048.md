  quite similar to Perpetua \u2013 some of the key differences: bowl doesn't meet
  the vertical in the cap R and P; the cap U is stemmed.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    which does have a stemmed U. The only obvious modification is the gap that was
    added to the P and R stem join.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike:\r\n\r\nThanks for your response.  I also thought it might be a modified
    Perpetua, but I tried several different versions directly on top of the logo art
    and, while some were pretty close, none were exact matches: serifs were sized
    a little differently, stroke and stem weights didn't quite match, bowl shapes
    were a little different.  The search goes on..."

  body: "Clive, The resemblances to Perpetua are too close (I think), and the differences
    you describe are so minor, that I still believe this is a customized version of
    Perpetua. Maybe 'customized' isn't how the vendor would describe it, because they
    want to represent it as a new typeface, but the changes from Perpetua are very
    easy for anyone with font design tools.\r\n\r\nI also considered that it's another
    Eric Gill design, since some designers tend to have a letterform vocabulary they
    like, but [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/aries/roman/|Aries]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pilgrim-lt/roman/|Pilgrim]]
    are his most similar serifs and not as close to your samples as Perpetua, in my
    estimation.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    yet, I'm beginning to think you're onto something.
