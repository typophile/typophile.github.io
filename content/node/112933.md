  is modern, the  exhibits obviously are not. I am looking for a flexible, contemporary
  type family that can carry some of that historic/vintage flavor without looking
  old fashioned. A contemporary and fresh look with some subtle reference to type/letters/history
  of writing. Not an easy task. Your ideas are most welcome."

    use actual typewriter type from an old typewriter enlarged, at least for headlines
    (maybe text in a contrasting typeset font), giving it much more character with
    the subtle variations in weight, slight imperfections, monospacing, etc. For a
    more contemporary feel you could use graphic techniques like reversing it out
    of a background, colors, etc."

  body: "Hi James, I like your idea. There is a web world of typewriter aficionados
    who hunt down old typewriters -- google \"typosphere\" -- and publish the results
    of their typing on them -- google \"typecast.\" \r\nA fascinating alternative
    to using modern fonts would be to contact some of these people and ask if they
    would type text for the museum on their vintage machines. It could then be scanned
    and the result -- complete with variations in darkness, alignment etc. -- would
    be a true homage to the typewriter. I suspect that most of these people would
    be prepared to work for almost nothing or even for free. Extreme dedication to
    promoting public awareness and appreciation of typewriters is their vocation.\r\nDon"

    Rowan \xBBan exhibit focusing on type rather than typewriters\xAB Misunderstanding.
    My fault. The focus on type refers to my approach \u2014 not the museum\u2019s.
    Typewriters (and the type they produce) are the core content of the museum. Pictures,
    including details and closeups of both old typewriters and their output (scans
    as suggested) are already used profusely in all the advertising materials. What
    I am looking for now is a consistent form of presentation (print, screen, web)
    in which type (descriptions, articles, basically all types of editorial stuff)
    will have a prominent role.\r\nApologies again for my poor english."

    digitized a personal-use face from one of IBM's proportionally-spaced Executive
