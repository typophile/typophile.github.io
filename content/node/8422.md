body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Can anyone help me? I am looking for a font/s to be used to brand
  sexy items and adult toys. I am thinking on the lines of something naughty, devilish
  &#40;I am also looking for a nice image, drawing or caracature of a devil holding
  a trident&#41; Has anyone got any suggestions even  or know of any useful links?
  <BR> <BR>Many thanks and a Happy New Year to you all from England. <BR> <BR>Regards,
  <BR> <BR>Paul
