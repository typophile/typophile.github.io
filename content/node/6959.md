  body: I don&#39;t know about who owns the trademark for Roslyn Gothic. It may be
    like Garamond. Nobody really owns it, because I think it&#39;s a very old design.
    Letterperfect, Panache &amp; Mecanorma all have versions of it. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    the other font is <a href="http://www.unifonts.com/p_pages/pompeiabold.htm" target="_blank">Unifonts
    Pompeia</a>.
