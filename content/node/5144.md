body: 'There&#39;s something that I used to use a lot in Quark, but haven&#39;t been
  able to figure out how to do it in InDesign yet: <BR> <BR>Say you have a block of
  text that has a mixture of leading values, or a mixture of tracking values. <BR>
  <BR>If you select the whole block, the &#34;nudge&#34; arrows become inactive. Is
  there a way around this?'

    and right for tracking, up and down for leading&#41;. <BR> <BR>R

    control, option, command, etc. keys with arrow keys&#41; on my Mac.
