body: Hey all - Hopefully this will be an easy one for the experts here... I went
  through identifont.com and it came back with 30 possibilities, but only one of the
  30 seemed even close... some sort of black oblique version of Diamanti. Do you guys
  agree or might it be something else? Thanks much in advance for any assistance.
