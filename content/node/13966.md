body: Ligatures are fun, everyone knows this is true and yet there is very little
  application for them outside of display uses like advertising, book covers, greeting-cards,
  and the like. OK, so there are plenty of uses. But for the most part we see the
  same fi fl ff ffi ffl fj and increasingly Th. The ct and st ligatures look old,
  but we've got them too. There are 953234362662886047744000000 two-letter combinations
  possible, ignoring case and allowing for same-letter pairs like "ff." Very few text
  fonts (<a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=142" title="Mrs. Eaves Ligatures">Mrs
  Eaves</a> springs to mind) go beyond the basic five or six ligatures. What would
  make an attractive though non-essential ligature varies by face. My question, what
  are you favorite strange, unusual, totally unnecessary ligatures and what fonts
  have you seen them in? Second, what ligatures would you (be you a type user or type
  designer or a 12-year-old with a pirated copy of Adobe Font Folio and a type fetish)
  love to see available just for the hell of it? Please, no scripts. This is limited
  to serif and sans whether for display or text. It's a slow day and I'm curious.

  body: With both LA and OO I can see at least two attractive solutions, overlapped
    or just joined. OO could join like OE, for example. What did you have in mind?

  body: "The other day I realized that it would be nice to have a \"kk\" ligature
    in an italic (or more accurately, cursive) face. Some word with a \"kk\" in it
    triggered this, but now I don't remember what the word was... But anyway I think
    Scandinavian languages have that a lot no?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
