body: "My client is selling merchandise to outdoorsy/extreme-sports-playing girls
  (4-wheelers, jeeps, kayaks, snowboards, skateboards, etc). Her values are strength
  & femininity; her message is that girls can be strong without sacrificing being
  girls. She's not looking for sexy or \"girl power,\" but a feminine, powerful willingness
  to roll up the sleeves and do what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nI love the sort of typography
  this suggests... my mind instantly goes to some kind of strong sans (probably set
  in italic?) with great attention to detail and subtle flourishes; but I don't have
  any specific font in mind. \r\n\r\nTypeface ideas? Either matches for the above
  or different typographical approaches would be very much appreciated."

  body: "Oh, thanks, Riccard0 ... my bad for not including that.\r\n\r\nRight now
    I'm working on the logo; so display fonts rather than text fonts are called for
    here, I think. \r\n\r\nI'd give the name of the company if I could, but I don't
    have permission for that. Let's just call it \"It's Us Girls\" ...which is not
    as cool as their actual name, but a fair approximation for the purpose of setting
    imaginary type."

    featured face, Condor?"

  body: "You may have more success mixing contrasting qualities typographically, rather
    than in a single face.\r\nFor instance, two contrasting types in one name, or
    a butch type in a femme colour."

  body: Kari Pro with FontFabric's Null? Or maybe go way out there and mix Dimestore
    Hooker with HI Luxury Diamond?

    they both mix slab serifs and grots with flowing scripts. Works well."

  body: One of the heavier weights of Karmina Sans, if you decide to go for one font
    that has both feminity and strength.
