		<div class="commentbody"><p>Technically, an Open Type font can contain either Postscript outlines or True Type outlines.</p>
<p>From a standpoint of practicality, any True Type font that is able to load on a Windows PC can also be loaded on a modern Mac running OSX -provided there&rsquo;s nothing really wrong with the generation of the font.</p>
<p>Postscript Type 1 and Type 1 Multiple Master fonts are very platform dependent.</p>
<p>Even still, some fonts that are sold as True Type are still sold for separate Mac and PC platforms. I recall this when I purchased a license for Clearview Highway at Terminal Design&rsquo;s website. I received a folder of True Type fonts, but they were also called &ldquo;Open Type&rdquo; for some reason on the website. The site insisted that PC and Mac users download their purchases from the specific Mac and PC links. Perhaps there is something that gets lost in platform shifts concerning letter spacing and other properties in the fonts.</p>

<p>Paul,
There is <em>some</em> truth in that, but things are not as straight forward as you make them sound (or might just be an incorrect interpretation of your words on my part). Nonetheless, you can&rsquo;t assume that everyone to know the true half of this topic.</p>
<p>Anyway, OpenType is an extension of the TrueType format. That means TrueType is a subset of the OpenType format. One could say that an OpenType font is a TrueType font, since an OT font can have everything a TT font can have, but the opposite isn&rsquo;t quite true (unless I&rsquo;m forgetting something&hellip;).</p>
<p>Why would Microsoft and Adobe would go to the troubles of developing the OT format if they (especially MS) could do it with TT?</p>

<p>This is interesting. When would a &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; TT font not be an OpenType font?
At any rate, I find it interesting that FontLab doesn&rsquo;t differentiate between TrueType flavored OpenType and Windows TrueType.</p>

<p>Not really. There was a period a long time ago when a lot of Poscript RIPs had problems handling the then relatively new TT format, so they got a bad reputation in the graphics business. But I&rsquo;ve been using TT and PS fonts side-by-side for a long time now, and have not encountered any problems with TT in RIPs since the mid-90s.</p>

<p>Todays quality TrueType fonts work just fine in print design. Any propbems you encounter with a TrueType font are not a problem with the format at all. The problems are with the individual quality of the actual individual font.  This is true of all font formats so you don&rsquo;t have to shy away from Truetype as a format anymore.</p>
<p>There have been instances where people have made conversions from type 1 to truetype and done a bad job of it but all the quality foundries large and small do excellent work. Buy the type you need based on quality in ether OTF or TT and you will be fine.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Individual font quality is indeed the real key regardless of format.</p>
<p>I deal with a lot of customer-provided artwork, which sometimes involves really wierd off-the-wall freebie type fonts gained from sites like DaFont and others.</p>
<p>Even from the early 1990s it was easy for anyone to tell not all fonts are created equal. Buy some little &ldquo;Key Fonts&rdquo; disc for chump change and then try to use them. Convert the type to outlines and see all the errant control points all over the place -as if the type were scanned and auto-traced. Then compare it to the good type you had at the time, such as a Garamond BE weight bundled in with Illustrator 4.0. Wow. It has a lot less anchor points and more smooth, gradual curves. When I rout it out of a 4' X 8' sheet of aluminum I have no bumps or divits on it from poorly placed nodes! Egads!</p>
<p>TTF, T1, T1 MM or OTF in TT and T1 flavors -people can generate really good or really terrible quality fonts in any of those formats. Observation of quality really does need to proceed in a case by case basis.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Laugh if you like. However, badly digitized type can be a real pain involving sign applications like neon-illuminated channel letters.</p>
<p>The seemingly insignificant little divit at the start/end point of a letter will be amplified to a much larger size for outdoor use. Complicate that further by all the parts which must be joined in a channel letter: a routed aluminum back, notched aluminum returns, an acrylic face which is often trim-capped. It&rsquo;s not easy to bond 1&quot; plastic Jewelite trim-cap to some acrylic face if there&rsquo;s lots of irregular bumps and other digital garbage in the routed form. Very clean artwork makes life easier in a manufacturing environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll usually not let bumpy artwork get so far into the production line that others in the fabrication shop are having to deal with it. They know my vehicle and can vandalize it as will!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a trim cap work in progress on a letter face. This was from a Taco Bueno channel letter building sign.
<img src="/images/old-images/TrimCap-Work_4152.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I have some better photos of our work back at the shop, but I found a few decent ones on my notebook:
<img src="/images/old-images/PicJoseppisLitA500_3986.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/RivieraChnnlLttrs_3952.jpg" alt="">
This &ldquo;Riviera&rdquo; sign featured a compromise. I had to apply a path offset around the actual jagged letter forms (ITC Humana Serif). This was done to provide a wide enough stroke to hold neon. The offset path was also edited to be more smooth so the trim cap process wouldn&rsquo;t be so difficult. The letter faces were decorated with translucent vinyl to preserve the shape of the original letters.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/PicLadyAmericanaSign500_6137.jpg" alt="">
Some may recall this picture from another thread.</p>

<p>The ClearviewHwy fonts have a few OpenType features (numerator, denominator, arbitrary fractions) with TrueType outlines. Since they do not contain digital signatures, they technically are not OpenType fonts, but they function as OpenType fonts. The reason there are Mac and PC versions of the font and that we ask users to download their appropriate flavor is that when all of this went up a few years ago there were still several issues with Windows PC running on Macs (OSX was not as common then).</p>
<p>When asked now, we recommend our Mac OSX users to download the Windows TrueType versions of the fonts. There are, however, a lot of sign shops out there running some pretty old software both on Mac and PC. More than once we&rsquo;ve had to provide PS Type1 versions of the font software to clients who were still running Illustrator 8 on OS 9.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One advantage of Type 1 fonts that no one ever discusses &ndash; mostly because it affects very few of us &ndash; is that Type 1 outlines are much easier to edit.</p>
<p>I know, TrueType outlines can be converted to Postscript-style vectors. They do change a bit when this is done. For this reason I always use a Type 1 version of a font. Hinting is easier to edit too. I edit most fonts I use, but I&rsquo;m one of a few. T1 and TT look the same on paper, and if that&rsquo;s all that matters to you, either format will do.</p>
<p>The only advantage of TT fonts is that they can look a lot better on a computer screen, if the designer has taken the trouble to hint them thoroughly. This is not always the case, and I&rsquo;ve seen some TT fonts look bad on-screen as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah, I really like her work. She did a nifty poster for School of Visual Arts not too long ago. I wish I would have taken a class with her when I attended, but I was an illustration major.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another sign picture. I don&rsquo;t have any photos of the sign installed on the building yet since it is down in Wichita Falls. I hand drew and digitized the script, deriving it from lettering on a cover illustration on their menu.

<p>Microsoft Office applications only let you bundle True Type fonts, not even Opentype. I think this is about to change but it is good to remember when buying fonts for the client.</p>
