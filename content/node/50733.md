  \ (The original sign designer has moved on.)  I'd really like to match that font
  precisely for use in promotional materials.  Please give a hand?\r\n\r\nThanks so

  body: "Florian, Litterbox is similar but not the same. \r\nJohn, I'm sorry but I
    can't identify it. Look for any pdf containing the logo or something written in
    that font, then look in the document properties and see if the font is listed.\r\n\r\nmomo\r\n\u2013\u2013\r\nAll

  body: "Giacomo, I forgot to mention that the original awning designer had tweaked
    the letterforms a bit from the base font.  So you're absolutely correct that it's
    not the same -- but looking at the considerable similarities between Litterbox
    and our sample, I'm convinced Litterbox was the original source.  (The m, a, f,
    and e are virtually identical, as is the u with a little tilt.)\r\n\r\nThanks
    so much to both of you for your contributions.  As someone who can identify maybe
    30 fonts off the top of my head, the breadth of your knowledge amazes me.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJohn"
