<p>Above is an example from something I am working on.
Though both sizes are more than one, and hence plural, it would seem grammatically correct to say <!-- raw HTML omitted -->points<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.
I prefer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->point<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as it seems more modern and can exist with out the superfluous s on the end.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->but<!-- raw HTML omitted --> why does it feel natural to use both in the same sentence. I could have just gone with one of the two options above but I thought I would see if anyone had an opinion on this.</p>
<p>So, I am proposing a style where in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first instance the singular<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is used and for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last instance in a sentence plural<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
BTW when I refer to points as a size of a type the number is a figure.</p>
<p>here is another example:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d think this distinction would also apply to type sizes.</p>
<p>The first size in your example, &ldquo;4.5 point&rdquo;, is a specific size. The next, &ldquo;21 points&rdquo; is more of a general description than an exact dimension.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a matter of nominal vs. adjectival forms. In adjectival forms with units of measure, you use the singular (e.g., &ldquo;20-dollar bill&rdquo;). When used as a noun, the unit of measure takes the plural with numbers other than one (e.g., &ldquo;it costs 20 dollars&rdquo;). So <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A series of seventeen Didot fonts sized between 4.5 point and 21 points <!-- raw HTML omitted --> is not correct, because both instances are functioning as nouns rather than adjectives, whereas <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A ‘9 on 12 point body’ describes a type usual to a 9 point body which is cast onto a body three points larger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is correct, because it uses singular where the number plus unit function as an adjective modifying a noun, and plural where the unit is used as a noun.</p>
<p>It might be different sometimes in a language that has plural adjectives, assuming it allowed such constructions.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Almost there. The shift to singular happens when the measure is part of a compound adjective that modifies a noun. Compound adjectives should also be hyphenated: a 3-inch nail, an 80-year-old man, 12-point type.</p>
<p>The measure stays plural if it&rsquo;s in a phrase on the other side of a verb. Then it&rsquo;s modifying an adjective. The actual adjective of the phrase is sometimes missing but implied: &ldquo;The race is ten miles&rdquo; really means &ldquo;The race is ten miles <!-- raw HTML omitted -->long.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, some fudging occurs when people start to think of a compound adjective as one that can be used where any other adjective can. Arguably, you can say &ldquo;The type is 12-point&rdquo; as easily as the &ldquo;The type is black.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s an unusual way to say things in most situations; we don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;The race is ten-mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at your example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A series of fonts sized between 4.5 points and 21 points was founded.&rdquo;
(&ldquo;was&rdquo;, not &ldquo;were&rdquo;, because the subject is &ldquo;A series&rdquo;.) I would argue that the word &ldquo;sized&rdquo; demands this form. &ldquo;This font is sized to 21 points&rdquo; is like &ldquo;This building was built 21 floors tall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that use of &ldquo;sized&rdquo; is awkward anyway. I would say:
&ldquo;A series of fonts between 4.5 points and 21 points in size was founded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You could also say:
&ldquo;A series of fonts from 4.5-point to 21-point was founded.&rdquo;
This treatment of adjectives is similar to that in such phrases as &ldquo;all creatures great and small&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Above all, measurements listed together as the same part of speech should be in a consistent form, no matter how much more &ldquo;specific&rdquo; you think one number is than the other!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If developing a &lsquo;house-style&rsquo; for usage do you think it would be good to differentiate between size (as dimension) and physical state?</p>
<p>[Updated from top] So far when referring to points as a &lsquo;physical state&rsquo; of a (metal) type the number is a figure. [i.e. 7-point type]. (Is referred to in singular, and is hyphenated)</p>
<p>So with the convention of writing out numbers as words in running text helps identify a size (as dimension) [i.e. three points larger] clearly differentiating from the &lsquo;physical state&rsquo; which uses a figure [i.e. 7-point type].</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A ‘9 on 12-point body’ describes a type usual to a 9-point body which is cast onto a body three points larger.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Concerning sizes (as a dimension of scale)
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;investigating features considered extraordinary or specific to the design of a typeface concerned with reproduction and legibility at sizes less than 7 points.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->becomes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip; and legibility at sizes less than seven points.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So taking two quotes (that I won&rsquo;t change in the text (as they are are quotes) but will apply the &lsquo;house-style&rsquo; rules here for clarity are as follows:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quote<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The process was reversed for the large sizes, 18 points and larger, where legibility was not a problem and an aesthetic motive could apply.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  [Walter Tracy]
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->would become<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip; for the large sizes, 18-point and larger, where legibility was not a problem and an aesthetic motive could apply. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quote<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shorted descending and ascending strokes are unforgivable on bodies over 18 points. It is quite legitimate to shorten the tails of the small fonts [lowercase] to increase legibility and to lengthen them in the display size of the same face for the sake of elegance.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  [Harry Carter] 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->would become<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;on bodies over 18-point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (as is descriptive of the physical body of type)</p>
<p>So far so good?</p>
