body: "i was wondering who designed all the other type classifications from the original
  font of Garamond, Times, Bodoni, Baskerville etc. Who designed the extras i.e Baskerville
  Regular, Baskerville Regular Old Face, Baskerville Italic etc and the extras for
  the ones mentioned above. How does the process work? how were they able to use someone
  elses design and expand it? dont you need some kind of *permission* (not possible
  if the original designer is not alive lol :D   ) but there must be some rules and
  regulations and anyway, how and when were they developed through out the yrs. are
  they still expanding? please explain. i dont understand.\r\n\r\nPS is Georgia a
  classical font too? what era is it catogorised under: the classical period, the
  Revival, Modern?"
