  body: Can you show us the entire poster? This is from a movie poster, French I am
    guessing. If we knew the movie we would know the date and we could, perhaps, help
    more.

  body: "I just checked the filmography of <a href=\"http://filmos.actricesdefrance.net/R/Catherine_Rouvel_ActFra.html\"
    target=\"new\">Catherine Rouvel</a> (well known French actress) and I couldn't
    find a movie that she appeared in with all the cast listed in your poster (not
    that the filmography is totally complete).\r\n\r\nShe did star along with Daneille
    Darc in the famous 1970 film <em>Borsalino</em>, and the 1974 sequel <em>Borsalino
    and co</em>.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that the movie titles were constructed from
    actual neon signs, therefore not a font at all, but derived from actual neon tubing.
    \r\n\r\nIs the poster in color? Are they actually neon lights?\r\nLest not we
    forget that many typefaces were actually \"inspired\" by handpainted signs and
    letterforms, architecturally sculpted forms, and yes, bright lights and neon!\r\n\r\nThroughout
    the ages, type designers have inspired sign crafters and vice versa... mutual
    love for letterforms and invention."

    of lettering obtained by using a pen and a plastic 'sjablone', the kind that architects
    used for lettering. I still have some of these lying around (DIN-type). My Rotring-pens
    are all clogged up, so making a sample is out of the question ; )."
