  body: I don&#39;t think it is overused. Usually when it is used, it&#39;s done badly.
    Your sample shows that eagle can be used with class and sophistication. <BR> <BR>I
    dont care much for the lower case which were reverse engineered since the original
    eagle was a caps only font. I always wished the G was more like the one from your
    sample, because IMHO the one that Morris Fuller Benton designed is too quirky.

  body: I love it, but the reason I don&#39;t use it more is that my successor at
    the theater company I used to work at changed their logo to it. It&#39;s now too
    uncomfortably close to me to be able to use it freely. Fortunately, there are
    other beautiful typefish in the sea.

  body: I used to use Eagle all of the time. But, certain characters started rubbing
    me the wrong way. The book and light weights work very well, accept for the uppercase
    G. The black weight is a lot of fun, but only used sparingly. I find that the
    counters are a little too small for most situations. Ironically, the uppercase
    G in the black weight works, and in looking at it I also have to say the the Bold
    weight is probably .... ah all this waffling ... If you can get someone to fix
    the uppercase G &#40;all weights&#41;, the off-center counter in the uppercase
    B in the black weight ... the v and the w seem to sit to high on the baseline
    too. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: I was at the El Paso Airport a few years ago, and all the signs were done
    in Eagle. Somehow in that setting it looked Mexican! <BR> <BR>So I wouldn&#39;t
    be too stuck on how it originated. It&#39;s how you use it. If it is sparingly
    used, it might be great. Also Fontbureau&#39;s version has a range of weights.  <BR>
