  font.\r\n\r\nThe font I'm trying to identify is on [[http://www.benfrankphotography.com|this
  page]], and is used on the name \"benfrank\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it
  was souvenir, but the letters aren't exactly the same.\r\n\r\nAnyway, any help pointing
  me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Mace"

    for an answer to what this font is, but there is always something off.\r\n\r\nthe
    f, b and k are usually the main differences in the fonts I keep coming up with,
    always clsose, but still no cigar."
