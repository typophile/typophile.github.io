  quite frankly, I have no idea what or where that info is. I'm recently self-employed
  so I decided to register with my new digs. To the question...\r\n\r\nI ran across
  this on the House Ind. blog/news and wonder if anyone knows this family name or
  is it something custom? I've cruised around their site and even did 'what the font'
  and 'identafont'. No results yet. Thanks."
