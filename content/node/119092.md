  body: 'I am not asking for anyone to complete the design. I am asking for comments
    on ideas about grid systems. I have a basic idea about width and height being
    symmetery . Which makes design functional and   astetically pleasing to the eye.
    .. This is guesswork at the moment i would like to take these ideas to a completed
    design '

  body: In my opinion you don't need a grid system (other than alignment) for a small,
    simple layout like you're showing, just make it visually attractive and functional.

    mostly aimed at larger, complex project.\r\nHowever, one that could be of interest
    for typophiles as well is Type & Grids: http://www.typeandgrids.com"

  body: I would like to ask another question. It is in releation to the size of the
    gutters. If my body text is Helvetica size 10 pt is the leading.. Is good practice
    to use the gutters width the same  size as the body text leading .

  body: "If you're talking about the space between those squares of color, 12 or 13
    pts might work fine. But I'd use more for the outer margins, and I'd normally
    like to see more between columns of text.\r\n\r\nGrids are fine, but as Riccardo
    mentioned they are more for larger projects, like pages of text or several documents
    that need to look similar. For a small project like this I'd just space things
    to look attractive."

    color squares looks pretty tiny. "

  body: " After the advice i now understand the size of this project didnt require
    a complicated grid system.\r\nI will later post my cv which does require grid
    sytem in the near future. I will open this post  again . tank you for the commen
    on the 960 grid sytem , i have better understanding now the 960 grid is not onlya
    about layout but also the how efficient it downloads the pages\r\n\r\nafter the
    advice i left the design simple as it was only to dowload some textures . Just
    usd a baseline grid \r\nhttp://fav.me/d7xnz3u"

  body: "In print, underlying grids serve as an invisible framework against which
    elements can be positioned to impart unity and cohesiveness to the design.\r\n\r\nIn
    web design, the 960 and other similar grids do much the same thing, but they also
    serve a different purpose. In essence, they're prebuilt frameworks where the CSS
    is already thought through and can be applied to a grid structure that can reconfigure
    itself in response to various display resolutions.\r\n\r\nHow this is relevant
    to the sketch you posted, I'm not quite sure."

  body: "I can't speak for James, but I think what he might be saying is that it appears
    to be a mistake because the gray and the black are so close in value. You might
    try lightening up the gray just a bit so that it looks intentionally different
    from black.\r\n\r\nThere's a greater distinction between the values on the 3dtotal.com
    site because of its use of lighter grays, diagonal lines and the even lighter
    gray lines separating the different gray/black areas, which makes the subtle differences
    appear intentional."

  body: "> the gray and the black are so close in value\r\n\r\nExactly. When two colors
    are very close but don't quite match, it looks like a mistake. Either make them
    the same or definitely different.\r\n\r\nSame thing when 2 objects almost align
    but not quite, or 2 lines of adjacent type are just a tiny bit different in size.
    There are exceptions, but in general it looks like a mistake.  "

    for learning to work with grid systems.
