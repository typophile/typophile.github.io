  know what font this is? Whatthefont failed miserably.\r\n\r\n(If it's a custom design,
  it's likely a custom font, as they've used it on more text than the one in the supplied
  screenshot.)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nm."

    But Insignia has got too many eccentric characters for me to be able to use it,
    so I would really like to find the \"cleaner version\" instead.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nm."

    for example ;-)\r\nI don\u2019t think the different lenght crossbars on the \u2018F\u2019
    and the \u2018E\u2019 are likely to happen in one typeface."

    be a custom design, but the F and E discrepancy is repeated in the full \"logo\"
    (above)."

    him -- the resemblance is too much for coincidence.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
