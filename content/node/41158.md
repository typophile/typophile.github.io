  and I'm wondering whether to buy any of them. I figured the exalted company of Typophile
  would know way more than I do:\r\n\r\n1) Designing with Type: A Basic Course in
  Typography (Bevington/Craig). ISBN: 0823013472\r\n\r\n2) Type Design (Teal Triggs).
  ISBN: 0060567597\r\n\r\n3) Rookledge's International Typefinder. ISBN: 1856694062\r\n\r\n4)
  The Complete Guide to Digital Type (Andy Ellison). ISBN: 0060727926\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\nAlex"

    are the most useful. \r\n\r\n(Of course, if the price is reasonable, it's probably
    worth getting anyway.) :-)"

  body: Not sure, I think it's a couple years old though. It's in a clearance-type
    sale.

  body: Well, I got my copy of Rookledge. What a great resource! All sorts of stuff
    you just don't see every day. It was only $10 for the 2004 printing. Also picked
    up a copy of Teal Triggs' Type Design and a book called Signs. I think it was
    $40 for the works.

  body: "WELL: a new edition of Rookledge? I was unaware of this. My copy is 25 years
    old, 1st USA edition, 1st printing. I reviewed it for \"Fine Print\" in 1983.
    I do indeed use some of its principles of looking at types when I'm at work and
    when I'm in the classroom.\r\n\r\nSo, seeing Alex's original post here, I became
    very interested in getting a new edition, as a help to IDing faces, and to see
    how well it had integrated new faces into the old format. Then I went to Amazon
    and read a customer review [I should say I rarely read book reviews of any kind,
    and I do not necessarily trust \"crowd wisdom\" to help guide my reading habits]:\r\n\r\nThe
    reader/customer wrote: \"While there is slightly more content, I think that the
    poor quality sample typography scans (assumedly from the original book) cause
    me to wonder if I should just keep using my original edition. It appears that
    even the linework and sample names have been rescanned.\"\r\n\r\nSO . . . just
    how much new content is there in this 2004 Rookledge edition? Are this new edition's
    problems as bad as the reviewer suggested? Has anyone here got both books and
    made a comparison? I'm not sure I'll find this in bookstores around here, but
    I shall look.\r\n\r\nI hope someone can help me. Thanks.\r\n\r\npowers "

  body: The 2004 edition is just a reprint of the 1990 edition (which certainly is
    an update on the original, adding about 15 typefaces to the book and with a forward
    by Frutiger), and, as such, is missing many of the major recent faces; there's
    no Jenson or Myriad or Minion or Scala or ... the list goes on. It's not as useful
    as it could be for that reason. The edition I have doesn't look 'rescanned'. But
    I suppose, not having an original to compare from, I wouldn't know any better.
