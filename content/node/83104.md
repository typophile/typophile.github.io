  body: "Spaceship Bullet is a similar freebie. The R is the biggest difference and
    could be customized (or made from a P) to look like this one.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.dafont.com/spaceship-bullet.font?fpp=50&text=CIPRO+cipro\r\n\r\n-

    Spaceship-bullet (thanks Mike Yanega), youthanasia and Bio-disc thin. \r\nThese
    were the most similar."
