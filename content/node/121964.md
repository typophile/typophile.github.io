body: The font really can't be that old. I has to be recent because some people use
  it a lot. The bottoms of the Caps have arks in them and notice the C how it has
  two serifs. The A has two bumps on the top as it angels down to the left. The W
  in the middle crosses over. The T's have slanted serifs that are raised above the
  letter. Notice the G, how round it is at the bottom as it has a smooth curve as
  it goes up from the right side.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot 2014-12-10
