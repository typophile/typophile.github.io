  I'm a new member on this site. I've tried to read as much as I can so I'm not doing
  something wrong when posting a font identification request. So bare me if I've messed
  something up. \r\n\r\nI'm working on  video game localization and run on this specific
  font which is not supported on cyrillic. To be more accurate... there are cinematic
  movies which are using this font. My goal is to find this font's location in game's
  configuration files and replace it with default font subtitles. \r\n\r\n<strong>Thanks
  in advance!</strong>"
