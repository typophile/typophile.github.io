body: 'I''m redesigning a journal with two sections: the first rather magazine-y (three
  columns, plenty of images, dense), the second somewhat bookish (two columns, more
  leading, calm and sober). Weights/styles: regular and italic, and perhaps also a
  medium. Grades would sure come in handy with the difference in density between the
  two sections, but I''d like your suggestions even if it doesn''t have them. I''m
  looking for a humanist serif with a contemporary feel to it -- more chunky (I guess)
  than a typical book face, but not all slabby and stuff. Suggestions? I have some
  options listed, but I want to keep an open mind. '

  body: Not sure if it fits exactly but I'm keen to explore what Kris Sowersby's Tiempos
    Text could be used for...IIRC the concept was to re-explore Plantin from a newsy/restrained
    angle, and it's definitely contemporary.

  body: Chronicle is not a humanist, and Clifford has a very specific old/ancient
    feel to it. I need something that feels more up to date, but still sober. The
    latter two are unfortunaltely beyond my budget at the moment, but I really like
    them both very much. I'm afraid Tiempos is too newsy.

  body: 'My [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|Williams Caslon
    Text]] has been used for text in both magazines and books. You could eg use it
    at 10 point in narrower magazine columns and at 11 point in wider book columns.
    I''ve also seen it recently used well at 10 point in a small paperback, like the
    old Penguin pocket books (column measure 19 picas). The bold weight is really
    a semi-bold, if that''s what you''re looking for. You would want something else
    in display; it''s been paired with Caslon 540 and Big Caslon, as well as Knockout
    and Archer.    '

  body: "The Janson/Kis typeface is one of the most beautiful old-style faces, at
    least Tschichold thought this way. Interview Magazine is using it for example,
    and it is a commonly used book typeface. The regularly used version is Janson
    Text, however recently a complete rework of the typeface was released, called
    Kis Antiqua Now. \r\n\r\nKis Antiqua Now has 4 weights and two display cuts. The
    reinterpretation turned out great in my opinion, the capitals are now in a more
    contemporary size relation compared to the lower case characters. On the page
    it looks great, not as monotonous as some recent typefaces. \r\nhttp://www.fonts4ever.com/portrait_typeface.php?language=en&id=5\r\n\r\n\r\n"
