  body: "I believe that was drawn up by Tal Leming as a custom variation of the font.
    I don\u2019t think you can get there with any fancy filter tricks, if that\u2019s
    what you mean.\r\n\r\nDidn\u2019t you borrow that image from the <a href=\"http://fontsinuse.com/fortune-magazine-500-issue-2011/\">Fonts
    In Use</a> blog?\r\n\r\nThe caption there says: <cite>\u201CFortune\u2019s section
    heads, using a modified and shaded MVB Solano Gothic, were created by Tal Leming.\u201D</cite>\r\n\r\n"

    something similar. Tal's work is stunning.\r\n\r\n"

    instructions on how to do old-fashioned lettering treatments like this digitally.

  body: I would start with the 'extrude and bevel' tool in illustrator and use the
    result of that to mask a series of lines created either by hand (snapping to grid,
    and copy paste) or with the blend tool.  Then add the little details by hand.  Hope
    that helps.

  body: What I've always done was to copy the text and paste it in a new layer and
    move that new layer to where I want the "shadow effect"to end. This layer is treated
    as a guide so my lines follow the forms of the letters

  body: I haven't tested it but couldn't you take some parts of the outline and apply
    a brush to it for the small lines?

  body: "It's a great effect, due in part to the intricate detail. I'm sure you could
    do this using PhotoShop, but I would be using Illustrator and creating a series
    of vectors you can reuse. This is time consuming, but you'll get the best result
    as you can exercise a lot more control over the shadows and line work.\r\n\r\nYou
    can import these into PhotoShop and add textures later.\r\n\r\nThis tut doesn't
    show you exactly how to achieve this effect, but may help:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/designing/create-a-variety-of-3d-lettering-effects-for-poster-design/\">http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/designing/create-a-variety-of-3d-lettering-effects-for-poster-design/</a>"

    enough to reply with a picture:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Thanks! It's a bunch of layered
    clipping paths in Illustrator. It looks messy in AI but it works.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AbARDLpCEAAMWnb_4205.jpg]\r\n\r\nGuess
    that answers that, then! :)"

  body: "I know the answer's already there, but I was just thinking: \r\n\r\nas to
    making the \u201Cextrusion\u201D behind the letters, you could use the 3D Filter
    in illustrator, keeping only the faces you need. Give the text a relatively thick
    outward outline. Then use an Expand-ed version of the text outlines to punch the
    space between the letters and their extrusions. And then follow with the clipping
    paths.."
