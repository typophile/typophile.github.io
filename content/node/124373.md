  everyone, thanks for looking at this. I'm translating this book and hope to keep
  the style and structure as original as possible, identifing this would really help
  as I have spent the last few hours trying to identify it myself with online tools
  but to no avail.\r\n\r\nThere are more headings that I can add if needed."

      However just by looking at 'Prologue' the 'P', 'r' (especially) and 'g' do not
      match."

  body: "ashecorven, not all metal typefaces (if your book was printed circa 1950,
    it was set in metal type) have been translated into digital forms that perfectly
    match their metal counterparts. Foundries picked and chose which metal versions
    to digitize, and the digital versions were often edited and \u201Ccleaned up\u201D
    to reflect the tastes of the era in which they were digitized.\r\n\r\nType foundries
    were also known to copy the work of other foundries and issue their versions under
    different names. You may be dealing here with a French foundry\u2019s copy of
    Ariston (designed in 1933), one that varies just enough from the original to skirt
    copyright laws. It may never have been digitized."

    you know of any fonts that are similar in style but have the same 'r'? It's the
    only letter that I've seen that is extremely different."
