    Very NON-web 2.0\"\r\n\r\nSure, but the Digg logo is more like Web 1.0, when designers
    were first discovering GIF optimization and pixels."

  body: "Reasons to like the current logo:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Boxy appearance makes it
    work very effectively if you think of \"text as user interface\", i.e., a call
    to action button. In fact, I would say that Digg does a poor job of capitalizing
    on that fact by NOT using the logo on the myriad \"Digg this\" buttons on the
    interwebs.</li>\r\n<li>There are no shadows, gradients, reflections, swooshes,
    spheres, whitsits or whatsits</li>\r\n<li>The logo reproduces well on ALL mediums,
    works as a single color, and works positive or reversed</li>\r\n<li>The overt
    technical connotations of the bitmap-esque letterforms are appropriate to the
    concept of \"repository of web resources\"</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nWhat they should
    replace is that stupid icon of the dude with a shovel, which is barely recognizable
    even at large scale.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/about-diggguy_5406.gif]"

    hate what they have, but I do feel that it needs help. I also feel that it is
    important to see the logo in its actual size, which is small. Hope you like,\r\n\r\nhigh
