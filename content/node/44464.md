body: So, I finally upgraded from TypeTool to FontLab. And it has all these handy
  little indicators that are trying to tell me... something. I've worked out that
  a red name/code bar in the font window means the name is not standard, and that
  a little blue square in the upper left corner means a glyph is being used at two
  codepoints. But I don't know what a little red hyphen underneath means, or why certain
  glyphs appear navy in the metrics window, or why certain kerning values are red,
  or why there's a little periwinkle rectangle next to certain characters in the kerning
  table... And it's really hard to find these things mentioned in the manual. It seems
  at least half of them must indicate something I need to do something about. Is there
  a key somewhere?

    means it's the master glyph in a kerning class.\r\nNavy glyphs in the Metrics
    window are non-master glyphs of a kerning class.\r\nRed kerning pairs are defined
    exceptions in class kerning.\r\n\r\nYou should read the Class Kerning section
    of the manual, which covers all this comprehensively.\r\n\r\nI myself haven't
    figured out under what circumstance a hinting symbol is displayed under a glyph
    in the font window. Sometimes they're green, sometimes red. They only appear if
    there are overlapping hints, but I haven't yet figured out the colours.\r\n\r\nI
    should probably re-read the Hinting section of the manual I guess!\r\n"

    H means you have enabled <em>hint replacement</em> to compensate for the overlapping
    hints. You don't want to have red H's--they should only be green. You can usually
    fix it by choosing Tools > Hints & Guides > Autoreplacing, but not always.\r\n\r\nRe-reading
    the hinting section would also be a good idea. :-)"
