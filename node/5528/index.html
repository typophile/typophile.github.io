  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Sorry, everybody, if this is to some degree redundant. I've combed through the most recent threads on this and related subjects, but haven't found anything specific to my situation. <BR> <BR>I've been contacted by a multinational brand producting everything from scientific gear to cameras to printers. They'd like to see a copy of my terms/licensing agreement that would allow them to license 10 fonts that can be 1) embedded in one of their software applications as well as 2) be rendered as graphics. <BR> <BR>My fonts? pixel fonts(!) Licensing terms for this sort of usage? I have no idea! Fair price? Royalty-based or flat fee? Again, no idea! <BR> <BR>The letter was sent by a Legal and Intellectual Property Officer in the interest of the company's UI Design team, so I'm thinking they have budgets for this sort of thing. <BR> <BR>My question: how the heck should I price my fonts, considering pixel fonts commonly come in one optimized size (at least mine do). They're not nearly as complex as traditional typography. <BR> <BR>I want my rates to be competetive, but I'm still pretty inexperienced, and have nothing to measure myself against. <BR> <BR>Anyone have any tips on how to put together an embedding license agreement? Should I ask them what kind of application they plan on using the fonts in, or how widely the app will be distributed? Or should I just stick to a generic rate?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; <BR> <BR>License fees vary a lot. I was in a similar circumstance recently. 3-15% of sales are license fees have been charged. It could be quite a lot of money. Don't get nervous! Talk with a IP Lawyer that understands license and contracts. If you want to contact me off list, we can discuss this further. <BR> <BR></div>
