  a typeface. After discussing concept and sketches it was approved and I am finally
  working on its creation on Adobe Illustrator. I am having a hard time since it's
  not a bitmap font unlike our old projects. I have read articles on typeface modules;
  unfortunately I haven't found any that could help me with this design. I would appreciate
  any tip regarding this project and I am looking forward for comments on my design.
  Please note it is based on the retro fonts used in old movie posters as well as
  those flashy arcade fonts. Find below some of the letters I am using as the foundation
  to my modules.\r\nThanks! \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo1_5865.jpg]"

  body: "The basic idea of a modular design is to draw a series of key letter shapes,
    then cut and paste sections of them to make up the rest of your character shapes.
    For example, if you first design an I, that basic shape can define the vertical
    stroke for the rest of your caps that have vertical strokes, as well as the standard
    terminal shape (serif or not).\r\n\r\nThere are of course other modular methods.
    Here is a simple example of a grid module method:\r\n\r\n[[http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.01.exercise1.htm]]"

  body: "Thank you for your reply cuttlefish I have already checked this website before
    starting my project the only ``problem\" I am facing is how to handle curves,
    and specifically their angles since this design is a funky one. http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.03.curve.htm
    handles a more geometrical shape. Any tips on that specific matter? Any comments
    regarding the typeface design?\r\n\r\nAgain, Thanks"
