  was a great help to me as I've been trying to figure out just what all it takes

    finally, my whole trip I was looking for an example in graffiti. Never found one.
    About a week after I left, my friend was excited to send me this picture-\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ogonek-graffitti_5051.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo,
    lots of people thought I was crazy (and a couple people thought I must be a criminal,
    taking pictures of letters, I must be up to no good). But... well, I can;t think
    of any buts, I guess I am a little crazy..."

  body: "Thanks for this. I had a long conversation with another type designer yesterday
    about supporting central and eastern European languages. We were debating whether
    American designers are better off devoting more time to drawing better letters
    instead of creating extended character sets to support languages we don\u2019t
    know based on the advice of a handful of people on the internet. Seeing how much
    more there is to just this one mark is really making me wonder if I should just
    stick to what I really know and leave support for these languages up to native
    typographers."

  body: This is a great compilation, thanks. James, why not cater to these extra (potential)
    customers for your fonts (they can always pick someone else's ogonek if they wish)?
