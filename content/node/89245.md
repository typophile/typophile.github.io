body: "I'm designing and typesetting a new series of first reader (and/or easy reader)
  books in Norwegian. One of the first thing on the list is choosing a typeface. I
  thought I should ask for your opinion. I divide my questions into two:\r\n\r\n1.
  Any typeface suggestions?\r\nAfter a few rounds we are close to settling on a candidate:
  [[http://typographica.org/2009/typeface-reviews/comenia|Comenia]]. Both Comenia
  Serif and Sans are lovely typefaces. I'm especially in love with Comenia Serif:
  natural and unassuming but if you really look at it, it has fantastically elegant
  strokes, fx the foxtail on the lowercase r, and and the much used norwegian glyph
  \xE6 is simply a stroke of genius (excuse the intended pun, see attachment). I'm
  a great fan of many of Franti\u0161ek \u0160torm's typefaces, which makes me all
  the more confident. The only negative I have heard from others is that because of
  its relatively thick strokes it can look a tad dark on the page, despite the fact
  that it has quite open counters. But this is not necessarily a problem, and of course
  also has to do with size and spacing. \r\nI'm still absolutely open for suggestions.
  Some keywords that I had in mind, the typeface should\r\n- be easy to read\r\n-
  have a friendly look, easy on the eyes, not quirky\r\n- be a good workhorse for
  both longer and shorter texts\r\n- work well in all sizes between about 11 and 21
  points\r\n- work well occasionally in white on colored surfaces (illustrations)\r\n-
  have a tall x height, but not too tall\r\nRegarding content the emphasis is on stories,
  i.e. they are literary books for youngsters. They are divided into different levels,
  with different amounts of text, but we wanted one font that works for all. Preferably
  it should be a seriffed face, but it doesn't hurt if there is a humanistic sans
  to go with it. The reasons for choosing a serif could turn into a lengthy discussion
  on readability, but beside the fact that I happen to believe that a good roman serif
  font works best for longer reading, it's also a good thing if the reader is given
  the feeling that he/she is reading a \"real\" book.\r\n\r\n2. The question about
  g and a:  When looking at the field of easy reader books in general they have really
  awful typography, to but it bluntly. One of the reasons for this, is the requirement
  that the letters a and g should look like the letters that the pupils learn to write.
  This means that the editors and designers have gone searching for fonts that have
  one-story a's and g's, and have found fonts like Futura, Neutraface, Sassoon Primary,
  and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Garamond_Infant.jpg|Garamond Infant]]. I
  wanted to avoid that route. Instead I wanted to something that works well in all
  regards, and if in the end my editor and her advisors insist that the a and g must
  have one-story forms, I will find a solution, maybe working with the font designer.
  \r\n\r\nWhat are your opinions on this? Is it important for inexperienced readers
  that the letters should resemble the letters that they learn to write? And if the
  answer isn't absolutely no to this: Why don't more roman fonts include an alternative
  a and g glyph?\r\n\r\nMy opinion would be that it doesn't take that long for young
  readers to understand that handwriting is different from printed letters, and that
  the differences between these letterforms are easily learned. But the dilemma stands,
  because when choosing a typeface for this kind of books we are faced with the following
  double requirement:\r\n- The texts must be easy to read for young inexperienced
  readers\r\n- The texts must be perceived as easy to read by the parents and teachers
  that are going to take part in choosing and recommending the books\r\n\r\nIn an
  ideal world there wouldn't be any opposition between these two. But as it is we
  have to think about it, and in such a way that the readers and parents on their
  part won't give it a thought."

  body: "Comenia Serif looks very good. Although, the f leaves me a little bit wondering,
    why is the crossbar thinner than the serif?? For me this is no logic.\r\nWhat
    should be peculiar about the \xE6?\r\n\r\nAnother typeface with a relaxed feel
    (similar to Comenia) is Novel, Sans and Serif.\r\n\r\nAs for the much debated
    single-storey a and g, those are certainly not the guilty parts if typography
    for youngsters turns bad. Futura has a single-storey a and a single-storey g and
    no one complains about that.\r\nI have made \u201Cinfant\u201D variant fonts of
    Andron with this alternate glyphs because there is some request for it. As for
    legibility, I\u2019d say its the same as with the usual glyphs, even for children."

    chirographic forms, which the readers will not understand.\r\nFor instance, why
    is there no serif at the top left of \u201Ca\u201D or on the right leg of \u201Ck\u201D?\r\nAnd
    what about all the f ligatures?\r\nThe virtue of Century Schoolbook was that it
    was a simplified, or naive, almost pop-art version of the typical modern text
    face of its era, and had an easy to understand thematic serif structure."

  body: Unfortunately overused, but I'd consider both Dolly and Sauna from Underware.
    The former leaning more towards book typography, the latter I could easily see
    as a text face for short paragraphs at around 20 points and it also has plenty
    of punch for titling work. Dolly's Bold likewise -- it's begging to be used for
    a childrens book.

    the monocular \"a\"/\"g\", the two questions are:\r\nWhat's the intent, learning
    to read, or reading to learn?\r\nAnd at what age does your school system want
    the children\r\nto learn the binocular forms? For example if you're setting\r\ntext
    for a book about geography for very young kids, you\r\nshould use the mono forms.
    In any case, don't use Futura as\r\na reference - it's a caricature of a font.
    (Although I'm not a\r\nlittle kid, I enjoy calling it Fartura. :-)\r\n\r\nBTW,
    in Comenia the \"e\" in the aesc is too much wider than the \"a\".\r\nThis is

    include modifying basic character shapes, just a slight increase in size (by scaling
    only), and adding a lot of new characters.\r\n\r\nBTW, Charter was designed by
    Matthew Carter."

  body: "Thanks for all the great comments! I see I went a bit over board about Comenia.
    It happens sometimes.\r\n\r\n@Nick: I see your points. But using the f-ligatures
    in the sample was a fault on my part. The typeface works very nicely without them.
    \r\n\r\n@Andreas St\xF6tzner: Novel Serif and Sans are awesome. So far I have
    only played with the demo version, but it's certainly something I will consider
    for other projects. The roman is indeed very similar to Comenia. The italic versions
    might have a bit too much character. I also quite like Andron, but haven't had
    time to try it extensively yet. Demo versions are great, the only way to really
    try out a font before buying.\r\n\r\n@Frode Frank: I considered Dolly, it's a
    favorite of mine, but the italic isn't straightforward enough, and the font lacks
    lining figures, as far as I can tell. About Sauna: Its charm doesn't quite work
    on me, I think. To me it just looks kind of square and geometric (without actually
    being either). Would maybe work for shorter texts set large. \r\n\r\n@Hrant: It's
    only on the first level (out of four) that we consider using the monocular a and
    g. To be clear, the only reason I mentioned Futura was the fact that some easy
    reader books use fonts like that. I could say: we're not aiming for cool (that's
    the illustrator's job), but for warm. \r\n\r\n@charles_e @T\xE9 Rowan: Charter/Charis
    is another favorite, and we we almost picked it. But so far we're still with the
    rather more rounded shapes in Comenia. \r\n\r\nWhich isn't to say that I'm ignoring
    all the good advice from these forums. For the beginner's books we're still trying
    to figure it out. One alternative is to pick something like [[http://www.linotype.com/6258/mantikainformal.html?PHPSESSID=6374ef1f344de88bb3c79717e8918b7c|Mantika
    informal]]\r\n\r\nAbout that \xE6: I made a little comparison with some of the
    other fonts that either were or could have been in consideration, and to my eyes
    Comenia is the more elegant, though it's pretty meaningless to look at this one
    glyph in isolation. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ae3_6138.jpg]"

  body: "The question of the simpler versus more complicated forms for a and g is
    a complicated one that I have spent some serious time on. In short:\r\n\r\n- teachers
    and book designers/producers seem to mostly prefer the simpler forms for theoretical
    reasons with no support from actual science.\r\n- young readers in first and second
    grade prefer the more complex forms (according to research by Sue Walker)\r\n-
    cognitive psychology theory suggests that the more complex forms are also more
    clearly distinctive and hence should be easier to learn and easier to distinguish
    (my own analysis, supported by Kevin Larson)\r\n\r\nThe idea that we *must* use
    the simpler forms for written works aimed at beginning readers assumes in part
    that they can and will be shielded from the more complicated forms. I believe
    this argument is obviously nonsense. It would require control not only of all
    lettering in the schools, but also of the home environment and everywhere the
    children go. They are exposed to the more complicated forms, and trying to avoid
    teaching them is just kind of silly, IMO.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
