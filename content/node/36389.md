  I just got handed my first project that will be build from scratch; so I pretty
  much have full control over it (instead of modify previous work).\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  for a nice clean font that would speak to the \"big wigs\" of large companies.\r\n\r\nThe
  project is going to be a recruitment piece that will highlight our companies new
  program we are starting. Most of the copy will be set rather large, in a small format
  booklet - if that helps at all in your recommendations.\r\n\r\nJust thought I would
  get a post going as I'll be starting this project in the next few days, I'm open
  to any ideas/thoughts/questions, etc..."
