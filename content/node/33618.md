body: "Following up on an idea from the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33531\">Spiro
  0.01 release thread</a>, I would like to pose a curve-drawing challenge to all interested
  typophiles. The following image is a 1200 dpi scan of the 60pt lowercase 's' from
  ATF Bakerville, page 20 of their 1941 specimen book. That resolution works out to
  1000 pixels / em, so if it's traced actual size, it'll be exactly right for Type1
  flavored outlines.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bask_s_60_5664.png]\r\n\r\nYour
  challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to draw an outline using the tools
  of your choice: FontLab, Illustrator, Ikarus, whatever. Also feel free to use either
  cubic or quadratic Beziers (I'd love to have examples of both). Try for the highest
  quality you can. The scan is pretty clean, but I'm pretty sure the flat patch on
  the bottom right is a flaw in the ATF work (the uppercase S doesn't show that, so
  I'll hold that in reserve if I have to run this again).\r\n\r\nWhen you're done,
  post a screenshot of your work, ideally at the same scale as the above image. In
  your post, include details of the tool(s) used, amount of time taken for drawing,
  and how many hours experience you have with that tool. Also, if you would, please
  send a vector version (PDF, TTF, PFB, whatever) to raph.levien@gmail. (Add a .com
  to the end to make that address work).\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, I will use the results
  posted in my thesis, as part of a comparison between my Spiro tools and existing
  Bezier-based approaches. I will also post my own screenshots after I see a few results
  here, but right now I don't want to influence people's choices of where to put the
  Bezier control points.\r\n\r\nMay the best outline win!\r\n"

    which I (still) feel most at home in, and I spent ~20 minutes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/S_5191.gif]"
