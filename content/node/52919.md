  body: "There are a few distinguishing features which might be helpful , but so far
    haven't helped me much ;-) One is the shape of the D counter, which is more rounded
    on the bottom than the top; another is the very flat, but bracketed serifs; the
    third is the Century-like y, with the ball terminal. The first of those rules
    out Modern or Walbaum, the second rules out Bodonis and Didots (which also fail
    the first criterion). At first I thought [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bell/|Bell]]
    was close, because it met the first two, but the y was wrong. (BTW, I am assuming
    that the ampersand may be custom or borrowed from another font). There was a typeface
    called Benton, shown in the Phil's Photo \"Homage to the Alphabet\" book, but
    the serifs weren't quite as flat.\r\n\r\nIt's a mystery to me. If it's custom,
    it could well be a wild goose chase.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
