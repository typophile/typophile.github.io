body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nJust joined Typophile and enjoying the various forum discussions.\r\n\r\nI
  set up a magazine at my University last year and have printed two issues. I do the
  editing and design but am just a hobbyist designer and still have a lot to learn.\r\n\r\nThe
  look of the magazine has been complimented by a lot of \"lay\" readers but I'd be
  keen to get any suggestions for ways to improve it for the forthcoming issue from
  people with a more discerning eye. The main typefaces are Caecilia and Arno. I don't
  want to change either of them as I think they help establish a visual consistency
  in the publication. I would be happy to hear more suggestions on grid layouts, combining
  type with images, supplementary information (there are some grey boxes with extra
  info in some articles) and contents page design. I'm wondering whether the article
  titles should be more interesting as well. I used different typefaces for these
  in Issue 1, but stuck to Caecilia for Issue 2.\r\n\r\nIssues 1 and 2 can be viewed
  on the \"Issues\" page of the website: <a href=\"http://www.sophiamagazine.co.uk\">www.sophiamagazine.co.uk</a>\r\n\r\nI
  think I'm fairly thick-skinned so don't hold back too much but bear in mind it's
  an amateur magazine edited and designed by volunteers.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nEd"

  body: "Hi Ed,\r\n\r\nCongrats on your magazines, and welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nOn
    first glance, the overall appearance of this magazine is quite nice, especially
    considering its \"amateur\" nature, as you say.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Consider
    avoiding hyphenation on short, ragged-egde paragraphs (e.g. p.2 of each issue
    and much of your \"Further reading\" sections). You may also wish to consider
    avoiding hyphenating proper nouns. This is often a matter of personal preference,
    but I encourage practicing it.</li>\r\n<li>Something about the narrow gutter width
    distracts me, but I can't put my finger on it. Perhaps someone else can help me
    define it.</li>\r\n<li>The folio numbers look oversized to me, but again, maybe
    that's a matter of personal preference, too.</li>\r\n<li>Not type-related, but
    I thought the muted red of issue one contributed a better vibe throughout the
    magazine compared to the vibrant red of the second.</li>\r\n<li>Good correction
    of consistent type families for the second issue. I found the variation extremely
    distracting in the first; to the point that I wondered if one of them was an ad.</li>\r\n<li>PDF
    versions: After creating your PDF, you have the option for the viewer to see it
    like a magazine, with a cover and subsequent spreads. When the PDF finishes exporting,
    open it, press Command-D, go to \"Initial View\" and choose \"Two-up (Cover page)\"
    and then choose \"Fit Page.\" Voila! A digital magazine! (<em>I should specify
    that it will probably only open in the customized view with Adobe Acrobat/Reader,
    not Preview. Not sure about other third-party PDFers...</em>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nOkay.
    I'm done boring you with nitpicky things that the others may find unnecessary.
    ; ) \r\n\r\nNice stuff, and good luck!\r\n\r\nRay"

  body: "Hi Ray,\r\n\r\nThanks for the quick response. Hyphenation is something I
    was planning to look at for the next issue. I'd like to keep the main body justified,
    so hyphens are kind of unavoidable there, but I will definitely try and keep them
    out of all of the ragged text next time. Certainly wouldn't hurt to set the \"Further
    reading\" ragged.\r\n\r\nI liked the muted red on-screen as well, but the brighter
    one works much better in print. Although we print a small number and otherwise
    distribute by PDF, I'm more worried about the paper version looking nice than
    the electronic one. By \"folio number\" do you mean the numbering in the contents
    or at the bottom of the page? Either of them could drop a size probably to match
    the text in the \"Team\" section or \"Further reading\" bits.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks
    again: it's great to have some input. I am just going on the advice of Bringhurst
    at the moment!"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThe magazine looks pretty great for an amateur one! One suggestion
    would be that if you want to run the type on the logo and other department heads
    off the top you might not want to cut it off on the sides. The reason being you
    never want those kind of things to seem like they might have been a printing mistake
    or not thought out. I do like the type running off the top however. Maybe you
    could bleed the box off the right but leave more space between the edge of the
    page and the right of the word.\r\n\r\ngood luck!"

  body: Which bit gets cut off at the side? The front cover title in Issue 1? Yeah,
    I think I might use text with no box for the future issues, and could certainly
    bring the title further onto the page. The "s" motif at the top of the pages does
    print in pretty variable positions but I'm happy enough with it as it is. Maybe
    the text with the article titles next to it could use some extra space before
    the "s" though.

    sure where to ask: are the red square badges on the corners of people's avatars
    a sign of something or just a nod to the Typophile icon that they've added themselves?"

    at www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucbpeal/sophia/issue3-web.pdf . Nothing particularly avant garde
