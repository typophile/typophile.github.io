    Does anyone have any information about the SpeakUp and Veer logotypes? Who did

  body: Looks like the Speak Up logo info is missing in their <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/colophon.html">colophon</a>,
    but it's probably a font and maybe a <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=search/results.aspx?keyword=Koziupa">Paul/Koziupa</a>
    joint.

  body: "Yup... Michael Clark did our logo. A pleasure to work with I might add. I
    think I basically said \"I want something that looks like this (Underware's logo)
    and this (Veer's logo)\". Sometimes it's not necessary to reinvent the wheel when
    someone has already figured out how to make it turn.\r\n\r\nAnd I think Veer's
    logo was drawn by Sheldon Popiel, Veer's Creative Director."

    see some lettering samples. I've only seen the fonts.\r\n\r\nSimple navigation
    suggestion: make it so the user can click the image to move to the next, that
    way they don't have to hunt and peck the next tiny number."
