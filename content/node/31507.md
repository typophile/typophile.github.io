body: I am looking for something similar to Helvetica Neue Std. Lt. 53 Extended, but
  with Tabular Lining Figures. I am setting numbers for a calendar and cannot resolve
  kerning issues with pairs such as (01/11) vs. (08/08). I have been working this
  for a few weeks now, and exhausted from my attempts to find an alternate. Suggestions
  would be GREATLY appreciated.

  body: "Have you tried looking at the similar weights of other sans neogrot faces,
    perhaps News Gothic, Unica, Univers (original and redrawn versions). Maybe even
    geometric (Futura) or humanistic sans (Frutiger) could fit the bill too. You should
    have no trouble finding a workable alternative for what you need.\r\n\r\nSome
    years ago ;) all type had lining figures that actually lined up, obliging us to
    resort to kerning tricks to make the figure 1 behave nicely in text.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck"
