  body: By the way - to me this marks reads either as 4P or HR, but not as HP.

  body: If the bottom left stem of the H wasn't broken I'd see HP alright. The break
    makes the P look like an R with a break too. Also the broken H makes all the negative
    space very busy and distracting for what are actually very solid, sturdy letters.
