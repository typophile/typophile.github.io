  body: "My old eyes aren't sharp enough to see whether the <strong>a</strong>'s,
    <strong>e</strong>'s, and <strong>l</strong>'s are identical, but the capitals
    make me suspect that this isn't a font at all, but very skilled handlettering.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, there are fonts that look like this. One example is Spencerian Palmer
