  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Trying to round up options for printing [[http://swapped.cc/stuff/tmp/card.pdf|this business card]]. I am quite new to this, so I would appreciate some guidance.</p>
<p>First, the paper is [[http://www.fibermark.com/details.php?productID=189|Touche]] from Fibermark. Amazing, suede-like texture. Somewhat similar to Plike, but bolder.</p>
<p>I want to preserve the texture of course, so the inverted printing is not an option. So white needs to be printed on black.</p>
<p>The four options I have arrived at are:</p>
<ul>
<li> Metallic foil pressing. Non-metallic foil allegedly flakes and doesn't look sharp enough when finer details are present. An example is [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/fusedesign/3024737502/|here]].
<li> Letterpress in metallic ink. An example is [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/themandatepress/3021655187/in/pool-artofthebusinesscard/|here]].
<li> Engraving. An example is [[http://www.beastpieces.com/2009/02/art-of-the-business-card-black-paper/|here]].
<li> Silkscreening. An absolutely amazing example is [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/zwoelf/2900054462/sizes/l/|here]].
</ul>
<p>I would rather not do the metallic ink if possible as I need to get flat white for the type. No shimmer and such.</p>
<p>I would rather not do pressing or engraving as these leave the imprint on the back. Though I guess this can be remedied by duplexing or using thicker stock.</p>
<p>Engraving guys said the white is not a problem, but opaque yellow ink is a special order, which takes a while and costs a lot (yellow is used for the middle stroke between two E&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>I am inclining towards the silk-screened version, but I absolutely cannot find anyone who can do it. Leave alone with very tight registration in two colors. Tried emailing the owner of Flickr photo, got no response. Does anyone know if there are any printers that could do this ?</p>
<p>Also the sharpness of small type on that Flickr photo looks very impressive, but I suspect it is very hard to achieve. Am I right ?</p>
<p>Thermography is another option, but local guys are saying that their white inks are not opaque enough to work on black. So I was wondering if doing termography <em>over a foil</em> would work - any thoughts on this ?</p>
<p>Thanks for any pointers and/or comments. I could really use some :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is unlikely that your <em>thermography over foil</em> idea could be done. Thermography works by dusting a powder over wet ink, and then heating the paper so that the power fuses to the ink and swells. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to print an ink onto foil, not to mention that the heat from the process would probably damage the foil.</p>
<p>Also, thermography is generally looked down on as a poor imitation of engraving.</p>
<p>Unless you can find a silk screener who can do the fine detail and the close registration your yellow ink requires, your best, and most expensive, option is with engraving.</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for taking the time to provide all the links in your original posting. It really saves time for the rest of us, and allows for better, more informed opinions.

<p>AtoZ, good point re: foil idea. I should&rsquo;ve thought it through a bit better before posting.</p>
<p>paragraph, AGL - thanks for the comments.</p>
<p>Talked to the engraving guys today, looked at some of their work and it is <em>really</em> impressive. So I will go with the engraving (which actually works out to be cheaper than foil stamping, go figure) on a thinner stock and then will have it duplexed to conceal the engraving imprint on the back. Then a bit of custom die cutting and it&rsquo;ll be a beauty :-)</p>

<p>My local engraver ran a proof of white Plastitone ink on black Touche and it didn&rsquo;t work ! The first sheet was fine, but then the ink started to adhere poorly to the paper on finer details. Which is quite weird, because Fibermark explicitly states that Touche is THE best choice for engraving. Perhaps the problem lies with the ink (not tacky enough ?).</p>
<p>In any case let&rsquo;s see what Mosaic has to say on the subject.</p>

<p>Engraved in white ink on black Plike ([[http://www.westernengraving.ca|these guys]]), laminated to Touche, and then die cut with 1mm round corners.</p>
<p>Unfortunately die cutters did a sub par job. The corners are not as sharp and defined as I wanted them to be, there&rsquo;s lots of glue smudges and jagged edges. Some registration problems too.</p>
<p>But even these things considered cards came out pretty awesome. Having two textures and the engraving really adds a tactile wow factor.</p>
