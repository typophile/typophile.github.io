body: With the help of some knowledgeable typophiles, I recently identified a typeface
  that I need to purchase for a project. I want to make sure I buy the legitimate,
  licensed version but the problem is that it was identified under three different
  names. How do you determine which is the original and not a knockoff? In this particular
  case, the three contenders are named Shango, Bauer Text Initials, or Schneidler
  Text Initials. All three look nearly identical; one included alternate characters
  which makes me lean towards that version. In general, are there any guidelines to
  follow to make sure you're buying the original typographer's design?

  body: "Technically speaking, only the metal version of Schneidler\u2019s font is
    the \"original\", so any digital version you buy will be an interpretation of
    the original design. In most cases the originating foundry creates the most accurate
    digitization and pay royalties to the source, but that's not always true. Your
    task as a consumer is to examine all your options carefully and see which fonts
    are of the highest quality, don't cut corners, come from a foundry with a good
    reputation, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you link me to your options I can give my take. I know
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango/?refby=typographica\">Sh\xE0ng\xF3</a>,
    but haven't heard of Bauer Text and Schneidler Text."
