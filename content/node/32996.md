  gum wrapper for a friend.\r\nMy guess is that I won't find the specific type, with
  it's quirky spirals, but if you can point me toward the root font of this face I'd
  appreciate it. \r\n\r\n* http://www.victoryseeds.com/candystore/images/adams/blackjack_70s.JPG\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for the main \"Black Jack\" face, not the sans serif, though that is a really
  nice one too.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help.\r\n\r\n-JB"

    a digital font like this. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/edison-swirl-sg/?refby=typographica\">Edison</a>
    has your swirls, but it's a very different style of face."

    if you added the swirls, would be close because of the bouncy baseline, but I
    think it's closer to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/bodoni-rr-campanile/\">Bodoni
    Poster</a>. I linked to the Red Rooster version, but there's one from pretty much
    any foundry that has done a Bodoni.\r\n\r\nI'm sure a revival of this style is
    coming very soon, and then you will be drowning in alternatives.\r\n\r\nSean Glenn\r\nArt
