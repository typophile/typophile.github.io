  secondary styles. now i am looking for hebrew type designs that create a set of
  styles (through structural change and within the same weight). i know about ismar
  david\u2019s david (and linotype\u2019s david hadash), henri friedlaender\u2019s
  (unreleased) attempt of hadassah cursive and ben nathan\u2019s days and nights.
  does one of you happen to know other examples / attempts that try to create a complementing
  style for highlighting within texts for continuous reading ?\r\nmany thanks in advance,
  nicole"
