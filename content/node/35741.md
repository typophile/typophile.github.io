body: "I am close to having to decide what face to use for an upcoming book project.
  The project has one or two unique requirements. It is about 85,000 words, and will
  also contain about 25% illustrations/photos/designs--i.e. text will be broken up
  and it will be unusual to have more than 3 pages in a row consisting solely of text.
  It will be printed on a book printing web offset press (as opposed to standard web)
  on high-quality book paper.\r\n\r\nAbout 35-40% of the text will be printed in a
  dark-red ink like Pantone 186 or 193 (the rest in black). Because of this I want
  a font that is low in contrast, and dark, as I am trying to minimize the 'pinking'
  of the red ink on thinner letterforms.\r\n\r\nI am also looking for a tone that
  is contemporary and cold (or perhaps more appropriately, austere). I also prefer
  a fully expanded OT font, simply for utility and ease of layout in InDesign. I will
  be setting at around 10/12.\r\n\r\nRight now my current choice is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_absara_ot/\">FF
  Absara</a>, but I have some concerns, and their rather extremely limited specimen
  PDF is worthless. Has anyone used this to set a large work of text? I am concerned
  about it being just a bit too busy for such a long work. I am also concerned about
  readability, though I have read some opinions that say this is not a concern. It
  also seems to be an extra wide font, but it's hard to tell without being able to
  actually use it. I'd love to hear from people with experience setting Absara.\r\n\r\nI
  considered <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=roman\">Dolly</a>,
  but in the end decided it was too warm for this book, and lacking an OT format.
  I am still considering <a href=\"http://type-together.com/font_karmina_home.php\">Karmina</a>
  from Typetogether as a possibility.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please, please recommend some
  similar faces and/or share the experiences and opinions about these fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much for your help,\r\n\r\nPaul"

    magazine.

    and Freight Micro is too playful and the italics are just too . . . wacky.

  body: I would suggest that Pantone 186 is a bit too bright for text, if they are
    printing on white stock. Tell them to go to the 193. Bright type will wear the
    eye our quickly. The darker the better.

    consequences when using type. The easier it is to read, the more successful the
    sell. Understand easy and readable type when doing a lot of it. Just look at the
    books you have around your house.\r\n\r\nYou may change your mind. "

  body: "Eyehawk, thanks for the input about the color, i was leaning towards 193
    for that very reason and you have helped push me even further in that direction.
    I will actually be flying half-way across the country to do a press-check JUST
    to make sure that the red looks right before printing 6,000 books. And yes, I
    agree easily readable type is hugely important, hence my post here and all my
    questions about Absara.\r\n\r\nMHSmith, thanks for the suggestions! Charter has
    a little too much contrast for this job but Oranda certainly looks like a good
    possibility. SAdly they don't have an OT version, so thats a strike against it.\r\n\r\nthanks!

  body: 'I''ve used Filosofia from Emigre in a number of books where I wanted a cooler
    rather than warmer look. It''s based on Bodoni. I liked the result on coated stock.
    It is relatively low contrast and is available in OT. The italic is very readable
    too. Drawback: Emigre''s refusal to allow embedding in pdf''s.'

    the \"F\" but it depends on how small it is printed and on what kind of paper.
    \r\nSubjectiv \u2013 i adore it, it's a strong one.\r\nCaecilia is a good, relatively

  body: Mendoza is certainly "austere", if that's what you're looking for. Presumably
    you have Bringhurst's Elements? Look at p.108 (vers 3.1) for a nice sample of
    10/13 Mendoza. Another low contrast possibility is Scala.

  body: Tyfa has the same effect. I guess I'd call it muscular too. It sits straight
    up on the paper and remains crisp. (I've been using it for a book series and the
    client finally told me they don't know if they like it anymore. But we'll see.)

  body: Absara looks like very small potatoes next to FF Scala, a real star that works
    superbly everywhere. Also, Bitstream Iowan, now available with oldstyle figures
    in a separate bundle, very warm and yet very clear, and not yet discovered. Quadraat
    and Eric Gill's Aries are worth considering. In the Adobe OpenType collection,
    take a look at Chaparral, Dante, Electra, and Giovanni. And though it offers higher
    contrast, Warnock is a really distinguished new option for all of us.
