    is the same book. If so, I wouldn''t pay full-price for it. This book is for hardcore
    collectors and helvetica-fetishists. I was given a copy so the collector in me
    was blessedly satiated without having to hurt my pocketbook. '

  body: "It's by Hideakai Otani, a web/graphic designer from Tokyo. The target audience
    seems to be graphic designers -- MdN is the publisher of a popular Japanese graphic
    design magazine.\r\nIt has 128 pages, half in color. To me it looks great.\r\n\r\nContents\r\nVisual
    prologue - Essay on Helvetica typography by Hiroshi (?) Sato, based on material
    from Haas, with designs by the author.\r\n1. Information about Miedinger and Linotype's
    Helvetica.\r\n2. History of sans serif. Features a digital redrawing of Haas Unica
    by the author.\r\n3. Comparison of Helvetica, Univers, and Akzidenz Grotesk.\r\n4.
    Tips and tricks from Japanese designers.\r\n\r\nThe author also designs fonts.
    One of them is <a href=\"http://fontgraphic.jp/2004/pdf/fgm_1.pdf\">here</a>.
    I like the [at] mark. The person who was asking recently about 3-sided [at] marks
    might want to look at it.\r\n"

    noticed that. :)\r\nWell, he's a designer, and that's why the book is in Japanese.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    looking around his site I stumbled across <a href=\"http://media.k10k.net/issues/issue022/index.html\">this</a>.
    Amazing. In my real life I do documentation for video kit, and I just <em>gotta</em>
    show this to the engineers.\r\n\r\nYou can click the little green buttons for
    font samples (although the links in the popups don't work anymore).\r\n"
