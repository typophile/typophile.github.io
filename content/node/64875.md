body: "I am working on a website for a service that wants to cater to a design/creative
  community. For this reason I was playing with an idea of adding an Intro page to
  the site that would be shown once, the first time someone visits the site. Just
  to set the stage and sort of help shaping the impression of the site <em>before</em>
  a visitor gets to the main page.\r\n\r\nFor one, I am not 100% sure that this will
  not come across as forced and/or cheesy. For two, I am not sure if I am overdoing
  it. For three, not sure if it looks stylistically correct to mix the small caps
  and lowercase italics. \r\n\r\nThat's why I wanted to get some quick opinions on
  the matter.\r\n\r\nHere are three versions of that page, black/black, black/white,
  white/black and also varying in a type size a bit. The typeface is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/hightower/|High
  Tower]].\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> [[http://certtime.com/sketches/splash-3.html|Version
  1]] </li>\r\n<li> [[http://certtime.com/sketches/splash-1.html|Version 2]] </li>\r\n<li>
  [[http://certtime.com/sketches/splash-2.html|Version 3]] </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAnd
  just to get an idea of the website's style, [[http://certtime.com/sketches/better-1.html|here]]
  is a sketch of site's bare frame.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or comments are greatly appreciated.
  Thick skin is provided.\r\n"

    school. (Enter?)\r\n\r\n2.\r\nThe intro pages don\u2019t look like they\u2019re
    in any way connected to what follows (or the other way round). Completely different
    style."

    I asked :)\r\n\r\n> <em>Any page that offers no link other than \u201CEnter\u201D
    annoys me.</em>\r\n\r\nWell, it will be shown only once per lifetime of a visitor
    (or rather visitor's cookie). I was more wondering about stylistical discontinuity,
    and whether this page may help with adding of a bit of Wow effect to the initial
    impression of the site. You know how they say that the first impression lasts.
    That's the intent."

    \ Why don't you use High Tower at all in the main website?\r\n\r\nI find 1 and
    2 a bit easier to read, but 3 a bit friendlier.  In 3, maybe you could make the
    gray a bit darker?"

  body: "I agree with Jan and hamiltro. Don't do an intro page. The site should be
    self-explanatory without the need for an intro page. People tend to view intro
    pages as unnecessary barriers to the content. If you include one, you'll risk
    losing a chunk of your audience to frustration. \r\n\r\nInstead, focus on making
    whatever service you're offering as obvious as possible. Start with a tag line.
    Not sure if \"Digital proof of existence\" is the tag line, but if it is, I recommend
    finding something much more to the point. And put it where people are used to
    seeing it: below or near the logo. \r\n\r\nThe barebones frame looks classy and
    functional. And the color palette works well. Excellent work.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't
    already read it, I'd recommend \"<a href=\"http://www.sensible.com/buythebook.html\">Don't
    Make me Think</a>,\" By Steve Krug. "

  body: "Thanks for the comments, fellas.\r\n\r\n@aric, I tried High Tower for the
    main site headers and such, and it doesn't really work. It has too much character
    to it if you will and just unbalances the whole page. \r\n\r\nWith regards darker
    shade of gray - do you mean the center piece or the borders ?\r\n\r\n@seventy7,
    I have the book, mostly obvious stuff. Too many pages, too little content, it
    should've really be printed as a pamphlet or a blog post :) I fully understand
    the hurdles/friction/etc concept of the user interaction and I was contemplating
    the splash page only because it might've brought more in terms of a Wow effect
    than it would've subtracted in terms of the usability and an extra click.\r\n\r\nThe
    tag line content is temporary. I will change it to something more specific...
    though it's kind of hard to have it both specific <em>and</em> short. \r\n\r\nWith
    regards to the tag line placement - it is still TBD. Placing it under the logo
    expands the header by another 20-40px vertically, and adds more dark emptiness
    at the top of the page. Putting it next to the logo is better, but makes the header
    look somewhat cluttered and busy. In its current position it is going to be shown
    only when the user is not logged in. Otherwise the right menu will expand to the
    left with more items and there will remain no space for the tag line.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for compliments, I'm glad you liked what you liked :)"

  body: "I agree about the book. I only mentioned it because to me including a gate
    page is kinda breaking an old rule. To me, the intro pages you've presented do
    not add a wow factor. The site is looking awesome. Let it speak for itself. One
    thing you might want to consider is including a pop-over page, triggered via javascript
    when people attempt to close out of the site. This could be set up to only trigger
    once per user as well.\r\n\r\nI think the tag line could work well in either of
    these two places...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/certTime1_5764.jpg]\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/certTime2_3478.jpg]"

  body: "Ditto on an entry page. Absolutely do not use one, unless it is a Flash site.\r\n\r\nThe
    site sketch is looking good! Definitely, you want the tagline next to the logo,
    probably to the right with a divider, as you mentioned to save vertical space.\r\n\r\nYou
    will find that, as you add content, the space between the header and the target
    area bg will be redundant empty space. Take a look at how others have solved this
    problem of connecting two bgs.\r\n\r\nBut yo... it's looking sharp! Keep us posted."

  body: "Okay, I just figured out that the numbers in the link text don't agree with
    the corresponding URLs--\"Version 1\" goes to \"splash-3\", etc.  For clarity,
    the version I find friendlier is the one with the white background; I would like
    to see the logo and the words \"the\", \"for\", and \"ENTER\" made a bit darker.
    \ In the versions with the dark background the contrast is fine.\r\n\r\nEven aside
    from the fonts, the splash screen and main site are really dissimilar.  I imagine
    most website visitors won't mind the difference (most probably won't notice),
    but by making the two pages so different, I think you risk diluting the identity
    message you're trying to convey.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if you decide to keep the
    intro page, go to great lengths to get visitors beyond it.  Set everything up
    as a link, so that if the user clicks anywhere (not just on the word \"enter\"),
    it takes them to the main page.  And set up an automatic redirect so that after
    some sane number of seconds their browser will take them there by default."

  body: "Ok, thanks, everyone. The entry page is no more. I had my doubts (that's
    why I asked), just needed a confirmation.\r\n\r\n@seventy7 - The second option
    has never occurred to me, and I quite like it. Thanks.\r\n\r\n@miro - The idea
    to use the text as a content of the main page is excellent. I even know the exact
    way to do it without committing to a specific Serif and still using only Sans
    throughout the site. Just make it a part of a screenshot.\r\n\r\n@dirtcastle -
    It's not obvious from the sketch, but the empty break is actually used for displaying
    descriptions of the menu items as the mouse is hovered over and (eventually) for
    the submenus.\r\n\r\n@aric - Thanks for the follow-up, everyone's gamma is different
    I guess :)\r\n\r\n"
