  isn't that common and I've been told that it has to be \"converted\" into an image
  in Photoshop or else one won't be able to see it in most computers. (?!) Is this
  true and how do I go about doing that? This might be completely obvious to most
  people but I am new to this so I don't have a clue.  :-)\r\n\r\nCharlotta"

    pc systems. If you're looking for something outside of verdana, arial, etc. you'll
    need to make it a gif or jpeg.\r\n\r\nYou could also try something like <a href=\"http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr/\">sIFR</a>"

      a lot of it...  Lherrou - I wish I were good enough to try the CSS thing - if
      it'll look better in the end - but that might be too advanced for me, like you
      said. \r\n"

    if the end-user has them installed, that's what they'll see, but if they don't,
    they won't necessarily see the same font you see.\r\n\r\nSo, yea, if you want
    to be absolutely sure that your font is seen by the end user, you either need
    to make it an image or use flash.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Charlotta,\r\n\r\nTo \u201Cconvert\u201D text into an image in Photoshop,
    simply make an image of the text as you want it, and then \"Save for web\". This
    usually works best as a .GIF image. Then, in your web design, replace the text
    with your new image. This works best when replacing Headings, etc, rather than
    blocks of text - it also makes the text you replace unreadable for screen readers
    and search engines (since it's now an image).\r\n\r\nA more advanced technique
    is to create your text as an image, but also place the text in your website with
    HTML, and style it using CSS, then substitute the image for the text. This allows
    greater accessibility for search engines and screen readers."

    you what can be accomplished with this technique (not to mention that it's a fun
    site to wander through).\r\n\r\nDoing the CSS part is not too difficult, but can
    be a bit tricky the first time. I'd be happy to help you walk through it.\r\n"

  body: Thank you - Todd - for the kind offer to help me. I don't question your motives.  :-)  But
    just so you know, at this point I have no knowledge at all about what CSS is -
    do you still think I can do it?
