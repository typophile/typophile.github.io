  As part of my training I am setting a poster with 'found' sorts of wooden type on
  a Vandercook press. One of 3 layers is complete, and I am moving on with the second.
  \r\n\r\nAlthough I am unable to identify many of the fonts I have at my disposal
  in the shop - 'Annex Press.'\r\n\r\n     Please, can anyone identify any of the
  type faces printed in GOLD; the lines marked 1 - 4. Thanks for your effort and time!\r\n\r\n

  body: "Gerald,\r\n\r\n    Thanks so much for the advice, I went to the Dartmouth
    Library in Hanover and found the book! Amazingly they had it and I was able to
    locate it amongst the thousands of books there. I am not even a Dartmouth student,
    but I was able to just walk right in and make photocopies. They had a signed copy
    in storage, which I was unable to see without a school ID. But I am sure that
    would have been an even better treat!\r\n\r\n    The book was a treasure trove
    in information and contained many of the typefaces I have been working with, I
    am prepared now to complete the final, third layer of my poster. I will post the
    finished version for all to see. Hopefully you can check it out!\r\n\r\n    I
    will most likely finish the poster next friday, the 12th of August. So look for
    it next weekend! Thanks again without your help I would be less informed.\r\n\r\n~
    Rusty"
