  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Let me begin by saying that I am a grad student in epidemiology with no formal training in design, so please forgive me if my questions are a bit amateurish! I am simply taking great pleasure in learning about the history of type, and I am making an effort to apply principles of good typography to my master&rsquo;s thesis.</p>
<p>Since my thesis is somewhat technical, there are frequent parenthetical or bracketed strings of numbers or acronyms. To my untrained eye, the full-sized parentheses seem out of proportion amidst oldstyle figures and small cap acronyms. So, my questions:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are oldstyle figures still appropriate for scientific text? Typophiles seem to be quite fond of them, but none of the major medical journals appear to use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I consider setting parentheses and brackets in semibold at a smaller point size and/or shifting the baseline to bring them in proportion with surrounding text?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arno Pro and Kepler Std are top contenders for use in my thesis. The former might be a little too calligraphic for the subject, so I’m leaning towards Kepler. However, Arno does have oldstyle &amp; small cap variants for parentheses and brackets that I think look much better among oldstyle figures and small cap acronyms. Would these be appropriate uses for these alternates? Thoughts? Suggestions?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance for your comments.</p>

<p>Not sure. Ideally they would have been appropriate for every kind of text, but since they&rsquo;re not, I&rsquo;d hesitate to introduce them myself. Typography is much about what we&rsquo;re used to.</p>

<p>Even if you manage to make it look good, which isn&rsquo;t trivial at all, don&rsquo;t do it unless you can set your typesetting system to take care of it automatically. It would be hell if you had to take care of it every time you changed the content of your text.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what they&rsquo;re for! :-)</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve been given some excellent advise &ndash; typography IS much about what we&rsquo;re use to. The usual comparison of graphic design is to architecture, but I&rsquo;d say set design for the theater is maybe a better analogy. Architecture can have an element of removing itself from an audience &ndash; in the fine arts, if you don&rsquo;t like something, it can be taken as YOUR problem. Good set design always has one eye toward audience. Your thesis is to be read, not hung on the wall.</p>
<p>A second thing to remember is that as a group, old style numbers have ascenders - 6 and 8, and decenders 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9, along with the x-height numbers 1 and 2. Anything you come up with will have to accommodate all numbers. Curiously, lower-case letters also have ascenders, decenders, and x-height letters. Do the parens bother you with text? If not, but they do bother you with numbers, you may have answered your question about audience. (They don&rsquo;t bother me with numbers . . .)</p>
<p>You also want to be careful using small caps in a scientific setting. Again, do what is customary.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One reason you might want to avoid OSF in technical work is that the descending figures may confuse readers with subscripts, which get common in Chemistry and some Sciences.</p>
<p>(To preempt messages from typophiles pointing out how different a subscript looks from an OSF, I know this, and agree. But scientists don&rsquo;t, and some will complain. I suspect this is why OSF are not used in most journals. When tried, there would be a raft of complaints.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I put together my PhD thesis (Genetics), I used Arno Pro because it has small parentheses and brackets that went well with the oldstyle figures. Acronyms were in small caps, too. I liked the &ldquo;calligraphic&rdquo; feel of Arno, as my thesis addressed some longstanding questions in the field, and several of my citations were from the 19th century.</p>
<p>Of those who read it, nobody commented on the typography. You could take that to indicate that the readers only focused on the subject matter, which is likely since they were mostly my committee members. Or it could be interpreted to mean that my typographical choices were invisible, or at least not obtrusive or countereffective.</p>
<p>Eliason, that thread was helpful. For the next printing I&rsquo;ll put all of my citations in small caps.</p>
