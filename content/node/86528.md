  anyone help me identify this font? The building this font appears on was built in
  1944.  I need to find its match, if one exists.  None of the other letters, symbols,
  or the lower case is available to me, so I've had trouble trying to identify it
  through more basic font identifiers.    \r\n\r\nThank you!"
