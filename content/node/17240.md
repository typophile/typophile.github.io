  \r\nIt is a free noncommercial font on their site but says to license as commercial
  to contact them. I have tried but no-one responds via email. (I emailed these emails:
  general@cape-arcona.com, king@cape-arcona.com, president@cape-arcona.com)\r\n\r\nAnyone
  here know them? \r\n\r\nPlease send them my way. Thanks kindly.\r\n"
