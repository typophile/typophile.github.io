  and would like to hire a font expert to help us. Can someone please make a recommendation?
  \r\n\r\nWe've run into many issues in the past getting web fonts to work across
  our 64 markets, and we'd like to find a solution before we start programming the
  new website. Example issues include specifying font-alternates across regions, defining
  what will work well across browsers, accessibility, etc...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nSasha"

    you might want to work directly with the foundry or a webfont services like Typekit
    for specific solutions for your website. \r\n\r\nI would probably be able to help,
    but as Nick already said, you should provide some more information about this
    offer. \r\n\r\nRalf\r\nwebfonts.info\r\n\r\n"
