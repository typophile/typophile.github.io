  body: "There are a number of \"architectural\" fonts intended to simulate the careful
    hand-lettering on documents such as you mentioned.  They include:\r\n\r\nTekton
    (Adobe)\r\nGraphite (Linotype)\r\nSchema (Fonthead Design)\r\nArchitect (many
    different with the same name from diffeent sources)\r\nTechnical (Corel/Bitstream)\r\n\r\nNot
    sure why I couldn't ID your sample - it may be a vertically compressed instance
    of one of those mentioned, or could be yet another. There are innumerable free
    similar fonts as well.\r\n\r\n"
