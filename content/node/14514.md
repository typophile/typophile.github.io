    hand, there are probably enough typophile members having a NYT issue at their
    hands...\r\n\r\nThis is only marginally related to your ID request, but worth
    a look anyway: www.typography.com/press/pr_04_09_02.html"

  body: The Times uses a mix of standard and custom faces - the Cheltenham they use
    for their headlines was drawn for them. But the stock indices look like Helvetica.
    The larger heads in that section might be Franklin Gothic, have to look again.

  body: "That doesn't match the font in the paper. It may be used in the slightly
    larger heads.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the Times font is custom but it's awfully
    close to Helvetica, look at the cap R."
