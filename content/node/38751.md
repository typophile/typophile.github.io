body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nThis is something I played around with a while ago.
  A rough modern serif for headlines. It\u2019s still in the early stages and a few
  letters are missing. I hope you like it so far and you could give me a few tipps.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings:
  Steven"

  body: "I just made a new PDF (Modern-Serif-Test-002-comparison) to show the differences
    to other similar fonts. All fonts were scaled to the same cap-height. So please
    take a look and tell me what you think about it.\r\n\r\nThank you: Steven"

  body: "It\u2019s hard to say much\u2014it\u2019s definitely a modern font in a very
    rough early state, but why? Aside from making a headline font, what are you trying
    to achieve so that we have more to talk about?"

  body: "I was bored of the most existing modern serif fonts. Most are a too clean
    and smooth. I just wanted to make a font that looks like done with hot type. With
    some mistakes in it, pulpy strokeendings and with an inconstant baseline. \r\n\r\nMost
    modern serif fonts like Bodoni and Didot looks a little bit too royal for my taste.
    Especially on the lowercase letters I tried to achieve a more friendly/naturally
    design. \r\n"

  body: "\"rough modern serif\" is really an oxymoron, since the point of modern typefaces
    is to be as clean, smooth and straightforward as possible.\r\n\r\nwith that said,
    I think you've got an interesting idea, but it needs to be pushed further, I think
    your intention is getting lost and the mistakes really do just look like mistakes.
    you can keep the idea of \"modernism\" alive in your typeface if you do focus
    on clarity, making it clear to the viewer that you're intentionally breaking rules
    and stretching the limitations on other \"royal\" fonts.\r\n\r\nhappy typeface-making!\r\n\r\nNiki"
