  body: It's Arial, but definitely use Helvetica instead. Also, try not to "stretch
    or mangle the type" when you redo this. The top Crimestoppers is extended and
    the bottom is condensed (Arial doesn't have an extended or condensed version.)

  body: "Not to argue with you Jan, but if you're going to pay for a condensed version
    of Arial, why not spring for the real thing and get the proper condensed version
    of Helvetica?\r\n\r\nWhy proliferate the use of a \"copy\" when the original is
    best suited for the work? "

    version of Arial.\r\nI didn\u2019t mean to say that it\u2019s beautiful ;-)"

  body: It's all good... I feel it's kinda part of my duty to first identify the font
    in question, and then second make sure that the right font for the job is used.
    We might not be able to stop bad design, but we can at least help ensure good
    typographic choices. a little pay-it-forward typophile style, if you will.
