  body: "1. The placement of the word \"the\" and also the tagline both seem arbitrary
    and look out of place in some of your logos.\r\n2. I would stray away from putting
    the graphic element around or behind the \"e\" (the house reads as \"the e nergy
    pros to me).  There are better ways to tie the graphic part of the logo in (i.e
    with color or placement that is not on or under the type)\r\n3. Maybe I'm old
    school but I would stick to using solid colors.\r\n\r\nIt's a good start, but
    I would work more on developing the graphic and keeping the type simple."

  body: "All 3 give a feeling of kindness and friendliness, which in this instance
    is good as the company is all about being kind to the environment.\r\n\r\nI have
    a few problems with the 'the' in Logo 7 and 3 as it seems to be disconnected to
    the rest of the logo and floating around a little too much. Also, the green grass/flame
    imagery looks like a custom shape from photoshop, which doesn't mean you shouldn't
    use it, but be aware that many other people will have access to this shape too,
    so it may seem a little too familiar or be used in other logos. Why not draw the
    exact shapes you require in illustrator?\r\n\r\nDave"

  body: "Emma,\r\n\r\nYou have chosen the font Nueva that is best used as a stand-alone
    display font. It distracts from any illustration because it is so intricate and
    full of life. I wouldn't use fake small caps like you did in logo3. Here are some
    fonts I would consider purchasing for this job:\r\n\r\nLisboa\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000080\r\n\r\nCronos\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cronos/\r\n\r\nAs
    far as logo7, I don't think the brush-drawn house is enough. Try combining the
    house with another element. It looks real estate.\r\n\r\nLogo 4 is the best of
    the three so far. I like the friendliness of it. I would work on the plant illustration
    and make it more interesting. Do research and look at some plants on stock photography
    websites like corbis or veer. Keep the illustration 1-color so it could be cut
    out of vinyl.\r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing what you come up with next.\r\n\r\n-Tom\r\n"

    for a tagline - even though I agree in concept, it feels too much like a bumper
    sticker on a veggie-car.     \r\n\r\nI also agree that Dan's post isn't constructively
    worded, but I'd like to believe perhaps Dan is a bit over-caffeinated (I'm fairly
    sure he doesn't want us to give him a \"beak\") and meant nothing aggressive or
    negative in his tone. "

    can understand the rationale behind the tagline but I don't belive it \"works\".
    You can do better in my opinion. You really should try harder. Perhaps something
    like \"Teach, Build and Live Green\" or take green out and stick with \"Teach
    Build Live\". Just throwing out some ideas. Which is what I feel you need to do.
    You seem \"married\" to an idea and that is a big mistake as a designer in my
    opinion. "

    am given the freedom from my customers to change an existing tagline. She posted
    the logo for critique, but she has not stated that she needs help with the name
    or tagline.

  body: "Of the three ideas you've posted so far, I think # 4 works best. But I wouldn't
    use Nueva (I think Tom's comment is right on the mark) and I would try to simplify
    the whole thing a little. My suggestion is that you keep \"unity\" in mind when
    working on subsequent drafts: all the different elements (image + the + energy
    pros + tag line, or whatever combination you choose) need to be connected and
    feel like a visual unit.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to learn a little more
    about your project: what image exactly your client wants to project; the core
    values of the \"Energy Pros\" brand (if they've gone so far as to define their
    market positioning, which a surprising number of clients don't seem to give much
    thought to before trying to create or change their visual identity); etc."

    a logo that uses one, I chuckle because it shows less creativity. However, not
    to demean your efforts - I know how hard it is to create a logo that's not cliche
    from scratch.\r\n\r\nI really like satya's approach... It combines green and architecture
    - but not hippie or hoakey."

    that the mark doesn't bring anything unique to the table as far as eco friendly
    housing - there's more to it than plants.\r\n\r\nI believe you may have chosen
    the original font to give it a more 'approachable' feel, but it really misses
    the mark, coming across as approachable, but home business-like and not overly
    professional - which becomes confusing cause by including the word \"Pros\" in
    the name ... well if they are Pros they wouldn't need to tell you that.\r\n\r\nI
    agree with comments made about the tag line. It doesn't really suit their business,
    I don't know that they'd be 'teaching green' much. Seems like it may have been
    a bit quick to jump on the \"green bandwagon\" surely there is something more
    unique about what they TRULY do then the catch of \"green\" is healthy/friendly.\r\n\r\nWould

  body: "<em>The customer may have picked the tagline and it isn\u2019t her decision.</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    may very well be the case. But from the way she worded it seemed it was her idea.
    My apologies if it came out harsh in any way, that was not my intent:). I just
    feel the logo can be much better despite of it's name and tagline.\r\n\r\n<em>She
    posted the logo for critique, but she has not stated that she needs help with
    the name or tagline.</em>\r\n\r\nTrue, but isn't the tagline part of the logo?
    Will it ever be apart from the logo? If not then the tagline should be part of
    the consideration, no? I understand that sometimes we don't have the option of
    changing certain things. But I feel as designers we have to be parental, in a
    sense, with our clients. Like an inexpirienced child (client) who doesn't know
    what's best for them, it's up to the parent(designer) to guide them in the right
    direction. Besides, my suggestion and the suggestions of other are modification
    of the exsisting tagline, not it's elimination.\r\n\r\nIM"

  body: "The other thing to consider is the real 'shape' of the brief. How much time
    is there to work on it give the agreed fee? And How strongly does the designer
    feel about it? \r\n\r\nOne problem with designing for this kind of message is
    that there are a Ton of visual cliches now because there are many many business'
    in the space. I encourage you to think it terms of how do you distinguish yourself
    from competition 1st & foremost. And that might mean screwing with the tagline.
    It might even mean a different name. Sure the client might say no, but respect
    yourself and ask for what you need to do the job.\r\n\r\n'Energy Pros' is such
    an 80's way of thinking about green. Not that it isn't important. But you can
    be quite efficient and quite toxic ( & un-green) at once. If you do get them to
    change the name CHARGE them for it! And charge them again if you manage to come
    up with a replacement - or participate in the process.\r\n\r\nI think taglines
    are dumb 99% of the time. Unless you have a huge advert budget and are selling
    a product - they don't work and signal an identity that is half baked and needs
    proping up. \r\n\r\nWow. I am coming off a bit harsh I think. I don't mean to.
    Good Luck."
