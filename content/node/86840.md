  body: "It's probably not a typeface really, but something like [[http://www.identifont.com/show?O3|Kabel]]
    or [[http://www.identifont.com/show?3RV|Scala Sans]] will get you close to the
    mark. (These aren't perfect matches. The C in Kabel lacks the angled terminals
    on the C\u2014probably because it was designed by a German designer\u2014but Scala
    isn't quite geometric enough.)"

  body: Considering the width of C and S, I'd say that's not a W at all, but a pair
    of Vs - which IS a W obviously ;-)
