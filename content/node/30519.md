  I am trying to find out which type it is. Its quite narrow , I like the proportions,
  especially of the capital letters. Has anyone an idea what it could be? The title
  of the books \"Jeremias\" by Stefan Zweig and was published by Insel-Verlag.\r\nludwig"

    especially of the \xDF-form. Maybe this leads you in the right direction. \r\nPS
    Do you like the font? Me not."

    out there. The closed P seems popular in some Dutch types, but even some American
    types in the early 20th century had it. We may not get this one unless someone
    has some good old German type books.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    But it just looks like Stempel Garamond to me, pure and simple."

    of Stempel Garamond (that square bottom on the a), that face was only published
    around 1924/25. If the book is, indeed, from 1919, then I spoke too quickly. As
    always."

  body: "yes, i had already the same idea, garamond, platin, janson, granjon, van
    dijck, then garamond again or at least a garamonish type, but somehow there is
    always something different or the time does not fit. at the moment I think its
    a revival from an 17th century typeface, or end 16th century. garamond or dutch
    leads the right way, I think, but I am not sure. Thanks for your help anyway.\r\nLudwig"

  body: "Ludwig, I own a couple of \xABInsel\xBB-books of that time. In some of them,
    as well as in the mighty tome \xABDeutsche Buchkunst 1890 bis 1960\xBB, the type
    is simply referred to as <strong>Janson Antiqua</strong>. I\u2019d imagine that
    it\u2019s an otherwise unknown (and in my opinion quite ugly) version from the
    late 19th century. Have you already asked the <a href=\"http://www.bleisetzer.de\">Bleisetzer</a>
    Georg Kraus? He might give you further advise."

  body: Florian, I think the typeface has indeed some similarity to the Janson Antiqua,
    but then some letterforms look more close to forms of the renaissance, like the
    capitel R or the M. Unfortunately I don't have a comprehensive specimen of the
    Janson. I will contact the Bleisetzer. Thanks for your help.

    Georg Kraus mentioned in <a href="http://www.typografie.info/typoforum/viewtopic.php?t=2123&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=&sid=b549565c9fca8949b181fb864f76fa1a">typoforum</a>
    that the typeface came originally from Deberny & Cie.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Elzevir-Antiqua_5335.jpg]
