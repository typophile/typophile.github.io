  body: Neville Brody, who designed Insignia, also designed a similar family of fonts
    for FontShop called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-typeface-6-and-7/"
    target="_blank">FF Typeface 6&amp;7</a> that comes in 3 weights. <BR> <BR>As for
    italics, you can always make an oblique &#40;slanted&#41; version using your style
    menu, or  the &#39;shear&#39; function in a graphics application, like Illustrator.
