<div class=commentbody>Thanks! Does anybody has more models to recommend? I am having problems getting real postcript laser printers in Amsterdam. I went to Mediamark (probably the best place in the area for electric appliances) and they only have a good range of economic laser printers with emulated postcript (mostly HP and 'Brother' printers). :(</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ricoh makes some good ones - I have the Aficio AP610N and it's very good. Prints up to 11 x 17 but I'm sure there are smaller models too. Xante has some too. Don't go with emulated postscript, you'll have problems.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The HP laser I'm using has serious issues with postscript. Photoshop files placed within the document either show a darkened overlay with boundary hairlines or do not display on the printed page at all. Some illustrations of mine which have complex blends or gradient mesh will not always print correctly either. Colors are always off & calibration is an effort in futility. I'm going to check into Xerox & Ricoh models myself.</div>

<div class=commentbody>No, unfortunately you will not get accurate results at all that way. :(
I've never bought a laser printer myself, so I can't personally make any good suggestions on where to go shopping. Maybe you can order one on the Internet?</div>

<div class=commentbody>You aren't really saying what you are looking for. Great quality, cheapness, black & white only, etc.

When I needed a good replacement for my imagesetter years ago, because a few clients still liked pasteups - I couldn't find anything better than the 1200 dpi black & white printer from HP. I bought it a special paper, and those blacks were solid and crisp enough for a large camera that still shot for film to plates to pick up clearly.
When I first looked for a color laser printer, they were almost all equal and not of very good quality. Two years ago, I splurged and bought a 1200 dpi Okidata (spent a fortune). I find it expense to own (you must buy 4 individual drums and 4 individual toners) but the quality is excellent. I tend to print out many an 11x17 poster for local shows with it -- and even the professional printers cannot get over the quality of the machine. (One even said it was as good as what came off his company's press, and he was in shock that it done off of someone's small business machine.)
Laser printers have changed so much over the years - it is one area where the technology has paid off. Back in 1989, you could buy an Apple Laser printer with a whole 300 dpi for $2700. Today, you can go to your local Staples/Office Depot shop, and pick up a superior machine for under $200.
Don't forget to look at all your expenses. I have a small HP color laser. It does a nice job - allows me to use different DPI which does save on toner - but the toner is expensive and doesn't last that long.
Sorry to be rambling, but it really seems you have a lot more homework to do, before anyone can give you a suggestion for what it is you are looking for.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Get a laser printer with at least 1200 x 1200 dpi.
Also, the costs upfront for the printer and the toner will be offset by how many pages you get from each toner cartridge. I've had my Ricoh two years and only changed the cartridge once. It spits out 20 ppm which is pretty amazing. Inkjet printers on the other hand will really run you on the supplies. Laser printers last longer too.</div>

Hi Jackie T,
Well, I am looking for an affordable B/W postcript laserprinter. More or less in the range of 500 euros. I will use it for testing font outlines so I want something that can print acceptable contours (if I can get it with that money).</div>

<div class=commentbody>The Aficio model AP410N runs about $500 US dollars which should translate to less in Euros. Check out Ricoh's Netherlands site - it was slow to load for me.

<div class=commentbody>Then patty has steered you in a correct direction. 1200 x 1200 is sharp (My LaserJest 5000 from HP was as good as any film/photographic paper typesetting equipment out there for a fraction of their cost.)
My only Ricoh experience was about 20 years ago with a copier machine -and it was great. They had use real glass grinded lenses rather than go the route Canon did putting plastic lenses in.
Patty - toner is funny. I had one machine, like your, toner lasted for years. And then after the first change in toner, it just never lasted that long again.
Ramino - you are correct in getting a laser printer instead of inkjet. I recently (a year ago) went looking for a little new color laser printer -- and was amazed at all the machines available now. I was in a store named Staples, and was able to get samples from each machine I was interested in. The machines ranged from $99 dollars up to about $699. I don't know if you have the equivalent or even a Staples store where you are, but it's worth going to an office store and seeing what it available in person.
I am partial to HP - because of low maintenance and high performance. But I seem to be using an Okidata as a work horse. We all like the machines we have, and you are very fortunate, there are many out there that can do the job, in all sorts of price ranges.
My best bargain - was a poster printer I bought at an on-line auction. Nope, not ebay. If I can find it again, I'll let you know - they only auctioned office equipment. Most of the printers were refurbished and warranteed -- made it worthwhile and good!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, I've found a Nashua P7026N. It has real 1200 DPI, A3 format, Abobe Postscript 3 and it is less than 500 euros. Fine.
Thanks a lot for the recommendations.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I got an HP LaserJet 5200, and it is total rubbish for proofing type. It prints way to light. But it was fast & easy to set up, so I imagine it would be great for graphic design. The University that I teach at has an A3 Xerox Phaser, and that is great for proofing type! But expensive, so…
