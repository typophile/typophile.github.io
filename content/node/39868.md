body: "It started out as a sketch of a man with an unruly dog and a shopping bag (Or
  is that a man-purse?). The Bad curve replaced the dog as an inspiration from my
  \"bad curve\" question. I don't like the bag. Maybe I'll either give him some drawing
  implements or a poop-and-scoop doo-dad.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Graphic1_6268_3590.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  case anyone asks, the font I used is Isoctuer, which I can't find out anything about,
  but I think came with AutoCAD. The rest in the suit are single stroke fonts. "

    type, but the type that you might need, when making sure you had a clean dog walk.\r\nI'd
    hope the curve isn't so bad you'd need that sort of bag."

    mechanical lettering templates</a>. The \"iso\" in both names sort of suggests
    a drafting/engineering connection. I know that Isoctuer is a standard font on
    AutoCAD, which is why it's on my PC and it's been there since... forever. \r\n\r\n
