body: "\"Normandie\" is a new Art Deco / industrial sans font I've designed, named
  after the 1930's French ocean liner SS Normandie. I currently have nine weights
  done, though next I'm planning on adding a set of italics as well as perhaps a condensed
  variant.\r\n\r\nSince Normandie is really only designed to work at display sizes,
  I've also designed a \"companion\", called \"Normandie Text\". I've toned down some
  of the more eccentric pieces of the original Normandie design, enlarged the x-height,
  slightly condensed the uppercase and altered the forms slightly to make it less
  \"geometric\". The hope is that this will read well at text sizes while still acting
  as a \"little brother\" to Normandie.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/normandie_6145.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/normandie_text_4411.jpg]"

  body: "Any thoughts on either of these? I'd love to get some feedback on the design.
    I'm starting to think about reworking the design slightly -- the original intent
    was to do a blend of French Art Deco and American Industrial, though I think the
    American aspect of the design comes through a lot more than the French (as much
    as I love Gotham I am a little uncomfortable about how similar the caps is in
    some cases).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of some good resources (online or otherwise)
    for looking at French art deco typography?"

    has briefly be seen here (http://www.typophile.com/node/60626) ;-)\r\n\r\nI like
    it overall, and, while I understand your concerns about the similarities with
    Gotham (and Neutra), I think it retains a distinct charme.\r\n\r\nBut, for better
    judging it, I think you should give some sample of text other than \"The quick
    brown fox\" (that's for Normandie sans-text).\r\n\r\nAs for the text version,
    I think the caps are still a little too wide compared to the lower case. Also,
    x and maybe r and s too are a bit wide, while o seems narrow. Poor e seems suffering
    a bit of overbite ;-)"

    think it is not fortunate to name Your work similar. Not to mention misleading
    and impolite to old masters. (the last is a matter for another discussion and
    my opinion only)"

  body: "Thank you both! I've made a few (minor) changes to the letterforms and it
    seems to be working a bit better...I'll post a new version of both in a week or
    so.\r\n\r\nI will definitely look into the naming...I certainly don't want to
    invite confusion (my other font up on these boards, \"Roster\", was originally
    \"Roster Gothic\" until I discovered Mark Simonson's \"Raster Gothic\"). I really
    wanted to name this font after the ship (I'm a devoted ocean liner nerd) but I'll
    run through some other possible names, too. Perhaps \"Pugnet\" after the ship's
    first captain, or \"Villar\" after Henri Villar, the Normandie's purser who was
    very popular with passengers.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I'll hopefully post a new version
    soon with some fixes. If anybody else has recommendations let me know!"
