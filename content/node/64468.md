  \"free fonts\" either:\r\n\r\n1) Do not permit modifications, or\r\n2) Require one

  font services like TypeKit and Kernest, which offer such fonts? Do we choose to
  believe that an EOT wrapper is not a modification? What about subsetting?\r\n\r\nI'll
  note that fonts embedded in PDF are usually subsetted, but most fonts actually used
  in the world do not permit modifications in their license terms.\r\n\r\nComments
  welcome. I'm especially interested in the opinions of people who are licensing \"free
  fonts\" under such conditions.\r\n\r\nT"

    Spalinger, co-author of the SIL OFL, is that EOT conversion is seen a ''modified
    version of the file'' and therefore requires renaming; a subsetted font file is
    also seen as a modified version. '

    was, \"More talk about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.\"\r\nLicenses.
    Legal bull. Sick of it.\r\n\r\nBut now I'm trying to wrap my head around the same
    things.\r\nNo choice. Last night I was reading the SIL OFL.\r\nThanks for the
    info, abattis.\r\n\r\nWith Typekit, I have no way of knowing if their EULA agreement
    is the same as is being offered to me when I buy the font. Right?\r\nBut anyway,
    I think that the bottom line for Typekit, Kernest - or anybody for that matter
    - is the \"Am I In The Clear?\" question. Does it seem like the intent of the
    creators is that I can do the particular thing I'm looking to do without a take-down
    notice arriving at my ISP. I've got enough problems, thank you. <strong>And</strong>
    I want to do the right thing by the font's creators and anybody who downloads
    it and plays around with it. If it's a sub-set, it should say so.\r\n\r\nIs it
    unwise to say that, as a rule of thumb, if you are modifying the original file
    in any way you should, at least, modify the name and/or make a notation in the
    version string?\r\n\r\nDon't know. Anybody?\r\n(And then of course, making a notation
    that you've modified the file is, in itself, a modification. I would speculate
    that at least 400 angels can fit on the head of a pin. Maybe as many as 500. :-)

    anyway.\r\n\r\nTP is referring, I think, to the way @font-face works in CSS. The
    font file is given a font-family name, an alias of sorts, which doesn't need to
    reference anything within the font file.\r\nThe web author can choose any font-family
    alias for the file the service company is providing. Kernest, for example, suggests
    a default font-family alias, but you're not bound to it.\r\n\r\nrich\r\n"

  body: "@TP\r\n\r\n>it might actually matter\r\nYes, of course it does. If and when
    you try to enforce the provisions. If Typekit or Kernest are violating EULA's
    the licensors do have remedies they can pursue. A EULA is a private contract and
    enforcement is, and rightfully should be, a private matter.\r\nYou can try until
    the end of time to explain to average folks that the software product they are
    buying is not the product itself, it's only the license to use it, subject to
    a list of restrictions, and they will still not understand that because it is
    so counter-intuitive. I, being quite average, have trouble understanding it on
    an emotional level, myself. If I can't use the software in a manner that makes
    sense to me, as defined by me, why are you offering to sell it to me?\r\nIn patent
    law there is the concept of patent exhaustion - once you've paid money for a patented
    thing, there is an implied license and you can do what you want with it. Perfectly
    intuitive. Once I pay money for something, I own it. Done.\r\n\r\nI'm being flip
    because EULA's <em>can</em> be quite comical. The iTunes EULA says, in capital
    letters, too, that the software:\r\nIS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN THE OPERATION OF
    NUCLEAR FACILITIES\r\nTry wrapping your head around that one. iTunes, this is.\r\nThere's
    so damned much convolution I don't think there's any possibility of unscrambling
    it without Federal legislation. A EULA is a contract and a contract can say anything
    you want. And it's a one-way negotiation.\r\n\r\nRegards, Rich"

  body: "I'm not really following this. Typekit or whatever similar service still
    has to sign an agreement with the owner of the \"free font,\" don't they? Well,
    let me put it this way: If the free font license doesn't allow something that
    a font subscription service does, then the font subscription service has to make
    an agreement with the font owner before serving the font, otherwise they are very
    simply violating the license.\r\n\r\nI don't know what Typekit or Kernest or anyone
    else is doing, legal-wise, but I think it would be wise to get explicit permission
    from a font owner to serve their font, regardless of how permissive their standard
    license seems to be."
