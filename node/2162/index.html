  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, new here but have just spent about an hour and a half looking through loads of threads, some of the ideas here are amazing! <BR>Anyway, I&#39;m in the process of designing a portfolio site for myself to bring some of the work I&#39;ve done together to try to push for a new job. The site is called optonica &#40;does not mean anything, just like the word!&#41;. So far what I&#39;ve got I&#39;m not really happy with, I just think its a bit boring. I think the word optonica really lends itself to something special, it feels like a very &#39;designey&#39; word if you know what I mean.  <BR>So, below is what I got &#40;the bigger one is just to give you an idea of context and colours&#41;, please can I have some thoughts. Thanks in advance ;&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20958.gif" alt="logo1"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20959.gif" alt="incontext"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike: <BR> <BR>I think &#34;optonica&#34; is a great word. Especially if you&#39;re dealing with a lot of photography. I think the style of the type goes well with the title, but it does need more work &#40;BTW, I like the unicase &#34;A&#34;&#41;.

		<div class="commentbody">I like those new proposals, Mike, but I am afraid the sign &#40;OP I guess&#41; is too heavy for that very fragile font below it. No.3 makes me think - maybe you could put just a name Optonica as it is designed in that No.3 suggestion. Even more, the number 3 which you have put there just to mark the suggestion number actually works great with a word. Maybe you could rename your site into &#34;3optonica&#34; It could have a nice pronountiation. Or maybe you could replace 3 by something else keeping this kind of composition. <BR> <BR>In case you would like to continue development on OP sign, you should reconsider the position of P in that elipse. The relationship between the two elements works too disturbing for my eye. There must be something wrong with P&#39;s left upper corner and its relationship to the bypassing curve. Another disturbing section might be the end of the O curve under P&#39;s on the right side. For me the curve at this point gets too thick comparing to how much thinner it is at the top of the sign.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Dragnim, <BR> <BR>v. 1-10: I&#39;m seeing the Minolta effect myself, but it&#39;s not necessarily bothering me. The whole series does have kind of a &#39;70s roller rink feel to it, tho. 6-10, with the &#39;o&#39; connected to the &#39;t&#39; at the bottom, don&#39;t read. The &#39;ot&#39; ligature looks like a &#39;d&#39;. Also, the &#39;t&#39; seems way too tall on all of them. Of these, 3 is my favorite. The interior circles on the &#39;o&#39;s are producing some interesting closure, and they&#39;re light enough not to create blotches like they do when they&#39;re solid. <BR> <BR>On the last group I think you may be off on the wrong track. I&#39;m not sure why &#39;op&#39; should be emphasized--it doesn&#39;t serve as initials or anything. As well, it makes me think of the OP &#40;Ocean Pacific&#41; sportswear brand that was oh-so-hip in the U.S. in the mid-&#39;80s. Dunno if that brand made it over to the UK, tho, so you may not have to worry about that association. As well, that particular teal/green/whatever doesn&#39;t work for me with the greys. Too similar in value, not enough saturation. <BR> <BR>I think Matjaz may be on to something with his recommendation that you use just the &#39;optonica&#39; type from the last round. It has stark sort of feel to it that I&#39;m liking. <BR> <BR>As a general matter, given that you&#39;re using a made-up word you should probably try to keep the type fairly legible. With &#39;real&#39; words, you can sometimes get away with funkier character shapes because people already know what the character should be from context. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m probably long overdue, but in your Nov 26 post you gave a bunch of iterations and some of the horizontal lines seemed to give a blur or haze. I&#39;m assuming this is intentional, but I think you can represent this by slightly blurring the left and right sides of the dot in the lc &#34;i&#34;. The screen resolution already makes the dot blurry, hence the idea.</div>
