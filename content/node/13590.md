  it's strongly bound-up with the Quranic revelation in two ways. Firstly, God's word
  in the form of the Quran represents unique evidence of divine revelation, which
  was actually conveyed orally to Muhammad, but was then recorded in writing by his
  companions and circulated. Secondly, this revelation is described in the Quran as
  an \"elegantly proportioned script,\" which is preserved with God on \"spotless
  sheets of paper,\" and which is \"beautiful\" & \"unsurpassable.\"\r\n\r\nThat's
  from:\r\nhttp://www.islamicarchitecture.org/art/islamic-calligraphy.html\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know the whole and complete translation of this particular revelation?"

    its entirety. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0940368323/ref=pd_sxp_f/002-5486206-0981646"

    ones.

    the complete passage in which the Qur'an is described in terms of 'elegantly proportioned
    script' etc. I'm afraid I don't know the text well enough to be able to identify
    where this passage occurs, but it shouldn't be difficult to find a reference and
    check it in any of the various English translations.\r\n\r\nOn a similar theme,
    there is a Jewish tradition that Torah -- the Law --, preceding creation, was
    written by God on white fire in letters of black fire."

  body: "In the Jewish classic Pirkei Avot, there is a passage where the sages try
    to reconcile the miracles in the Bible with the Greek concept of natural law.
    \r\n\r\nThe way they reconcile it is by saying that all the miraculous stuff that
    goes against nature, such as Moses' staff, was specially created by God in the
    last moments of creation. One of the things that was created was the Ten Commandments,
    ready for Moses to receive. But to do this God also had to create \"the script,
    the stylus, the tablets\" (Avot 5:9). \r\n\r\nThus according to the sages, God
    invented script, and so was the first designer of letters. As a typophile, I had
    to smile when I read this; it is somehow fitting that those who almost worshiped
    written language--and were often scribes--were comfortable with the idea that
    God invented writing.  \r\n\r\n(ps John, 'Law' is not an accurate translation
    of 'Torah'. Some of the mystics thought that God first wrote the Torah, with the
    account of creation in Genesis, and then used it as a blueprint to create the
    world.) "

    expounds on the \"dark side\" of writing. We should never forget that, since even
    in this day the written word serves as an excuse to some to blow up and/or enslave
    their fellow man.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "David, I checked some of the very few religious references I have, and didn't
    find anything specific to the script or the paper, but did note the following:\r\n\r\n1)
    The \"terrestrial\" Qur'aan is a copy of the original that resides with Allah.\r\n\r\n2)
    There is mention of Arabic being the divine language of the Qur'aan. But I guess
    it is possible to equate the script with the language in this context.\r\n\r\n3)
    There is a hadeeth (which I think is basically external -but \"official\"- commentary)
    by Al-Baaqillaani that mentions something seemingly related to composition, if
    not the script or paper per se. In explaining the miraculous nature of the Qur'aan,
    he writes that \"it is wonderfully arranged, and marvelously composed, and so
    exalted in its literary elegance as to be beyond what any mere creature could
    attain.\"\r\n\r\n4) Muhammad was essentially illiterate before having the Qur'aan
    abruptly revealed to him.\r\n\r\n5) The Qur'aan -although revealed as a book-
    is fundamentally phonetic. They way it's written, euphonically, it is claimed
    causes it to only be understood when sounded out (or least voiced internally).
    And this is why many people think you have to know Arabic to understand Islam.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    with god than most, so  when I read this partial translation that seems to say,
    \"preserved with God on \u201Cspotless sheets of paper,\u201D...\" I became very
    curious at the mixing of the concept of the script in God's hands, and... in a
    particular technology, even. . .  ya know, paper was pretty new then."

  body: 'I suspect that Hrant is right about it being not part of the Koran, but of
    the Hadith. (If it is indeed accurate.) I believe the Hadith is supposed to be
    things that Muhammed said to his followers, not as revelations from God, but as
    his own comments. These of course have authority with devout Muslims. There is
    a contact e-mail address on the site you link to, so I guess that would be the
    best bet to get an answer.  '

  body: "To my knowledge, the Quraan never stated that the Arabic script is a divine
    or holly one. But the Arabic language was mentioned in many \"Surahs\", or Quaan
    chapters, as the language of Quraan without even adding any special status of
    Arabic other that its is the language of prophet Muhammad. Here is a link to some
    of them:  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.quraan.com/Index.aspx?abindex=7&tabid=45&qst=2&query=Arabic\r\n\r\nQuestionable
    restrictions were placed later on direct translations but never on the script
    used for writing the Arabic text of the Quraan.  This why was transliterated in
    many scripts. \r\n\r\nAs of Hadith, Hrant is right.  I have even read a \"supposedly\"
    Hadith proclaiming the \"lam-Alif\" ligature as a holly or chosen one.  But not
    all hadith is authentic stuff.  This is why the Quraan was there.\r\n\r\nSo back
    to David's question, I do not think the \"Islamic Architecture\" site was right.
    Quotes from the Quraan are always referring to a \"Surah\" and \"Ayah\".  What
    was theirs?\r\n"
