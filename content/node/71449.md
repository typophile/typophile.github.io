  was wondering if you all could recommend some visually inspiring books I can purchase.
  I just need some inspiration on how to combine various typefaces, as well as some
  ideas on creating cool badges or seals to embellish titles or whatnot. I see rock
  poster designers use them quite a bit and they look pretty sharp in the right context
  (think: National Park Servic signs/badges). I think the typography from that era
  looks really good and thought I'd see if anyone had some recommendations of source
  materials.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\na"

    you won't go wrong just using one.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIf you are seriously interested
    in history, dabble in it first hand: don't (just) read other people's opinions
    on what they identify as meaningful, but keep an eye open for ephemera from the
    era, and collect it -- the image above is from a 1950s Danish furniture catalogue
    that a friend gave me, because she knew I cherish such artefacts.\r\n"
