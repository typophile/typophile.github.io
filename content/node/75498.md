    of this article, \u201CSimon Garfield wrote this article in Georgia regular.\u201D
    ... which should be followed by \u201C...but we at the BBC chose to publish it
    on our website in Arial/Helvetica.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnyone want to write an article
    called \"What\u2019s so wrong with straight apostrophes in headlines?\"\r\n\r\nOh,
    and ANY font will look horrible in multi-coloured fully-justified letterspaced
    lowercase on a yellow background, surely?"

  body: "Comic Sans is not a <em>bad</em> typeface. It is suitable for use as an informal
    script typeface for materials that can use a bright and cheerful touch, especially
    if they're associated with children.\r\n\r\nBut because it's a standard face that
    comes with Windows, it's often used, because nothing else is at hand that comes
    close, for purposes to which it isn't suitable.\r\n\r\nFor example, it might be
    used to simulate hand lettering - such as in word balloons in a comic. Or it might
    be used where Papyrus, or Hobo, or even Dom Casual might be called for.\r\n\r\nIf
    people use Georgia when they really wanted to use Caledonia or Baskerville or
    Garamond, little harm is done - all these faces are nice standard text faces,
    suitable for book use, which don't happen to be Times Roman. But when it comes
    to display faces, there are many different display faces which have different
    purposes. You wouldn't think that Bifur, Peignot Bold, and Avant Garde were interchangeable.\r\n\r\nComic
    Sans, because it's handy, gets used beyond its range of applicability. And often
    by people who don't know or don't care about typography - and in bright, clashing
    colors - so good results are not to be expected."
