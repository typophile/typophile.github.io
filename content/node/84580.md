  in a logo, and am trying to find a good sans-serif companion for letterhead, business
  cards, presentation copy, etc. Turnpike matches well with some of Font Diner's retro
  scripts, but I am taking the logo in a more modern direction and I want to find
  a clean sans-serif companion that has a little bit of spunk. Some options I'm looking
  at are Typotheque's Jigsaw, HJF's Ideal Sans, and HVD's Brandon Grotesque. \r\n\r\nMy
  problem is, I like all of these faces alone but none of them were chosen based on
  how they pair with Turnpike. My usual rules for pairing are to find contrast or
  keep it withing the same \"family\", but I'm floundering a little with sans-on-sans.
  I can't tell if I should use something that matches' Turnpike's wideness, or go
  thin and narrow; if I should stay with something geometric and straight-edged, or
  go more rounded or organic. Any general rules you guys use for making these kinds
  of parings or even specific suggestions?\r\n\r\nI know the best option is just to
  type them out together and stare at them for a few hours, but since I haven't actually
  purchased any of them except Turnpike, that process is a little cumbersome.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nHeather\r\n"

    It's tightly fitted with a big x-height, so will set a strong text block to hold
    its own against Turnpike. \r\nBeing slightly condensed, it will contrast in that
    respect with the wide Turnpike. And the reductive Futura-plan l.c. letter shapes
    are somewhat in harmony with Turnpike. Sorry, no small caps, but there are alternate
    figure styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
