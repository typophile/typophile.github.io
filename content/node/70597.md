    things happen\u2026 'Quick Test As' has never worked\u2026 ever\u2026 and at times
    in the past has crashed the program, also the Metric Commands Toolbar dropdown
    options fail to work\u2026 so when I come across bugs I report them and then move
    on to avoid frustration\u2026 occasionally I trash the preferences to get the
    Metric Commands Toolbar back in order\u2026 hopefully some of these things will
    be resolved in the next version. Maybe it's an OS X / Mac thing?"
