  body: "The cover of single-DVD release of the movie also uses Futura.\r\n\r\nBut
    strangely, the cover of the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD uses a completely different
    typeface: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/konvexist/alternate-oblique/\">Konvexist-Alternate
    Oblique</a>.\r\n\r\n(See them both <a href=\"http://www.superherohype.com/news/vforvendettanews.php?id=4237\">here</a>).\r\n\r\nStrange."

  body: 'It isn''t just the DVD cover.  Futura is pervasive throughout the film (i
    believe intentionally so).  Everything from the ending credits to the propaganda
    posters displayed on London''s streets, from the curfew notices to the headlines
    and body copy of newspapers--every bit of type in the film is Futura.  '
