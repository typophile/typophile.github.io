  body: "Small print... \r\n\r\nAugust 1 is Swiss National Day, and we\u2019re celebrating
    in style! SOTA is proud to present the Seattle premiere of Helvetica, Gary Hustwit\u2019s
    indie film about a typeface.\r\n\r\nHelvetica will be screened Wednesday, August
    1, at 7 pm at Kane Hall on the University of Washington campus. A discussion with
    the director and Matthew Carter, one of the designers featured in the film, will
    take place after the show.\r\n\r\nThe screening is free and open to the public.
    Tickets for the general public are now available on a first-come, first-served
    basis. TypeCon2007 attendees and SOTA members guaranteed seating.\r\n\r\nThis
    critically-acclaimed festival favorite is a Swiss Dots production, in association
    with Veer. This special evening is sponsored by Veer and hosted by the College
    of Arts and Sciences at the University of Washington. Register now to get a ticket
    to this fantastic free event. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Unlike Dan I've only been to one screening, the one in Thessaloniki and it
    was all quite civilized - Gary wore both an 'I Love Helvetica' and a 'I Hate Helvetica'
    pin badge. The only potential fight was when we realized that they'd be no cocktails
    at the cocktail reception. That was easily remedied by heading to the closest
    bar.\r\n\r\nSee Gary's blog for an idea as to what to expect atmosphere-wise.

  body: I'm seeing some decidedly non-designer company names listed in the Helvetica
    film registrations... as well as the assorted relatives and loved ones of creative
    types. Guess they want to try and understand what drives us. I predict a sellout
    of the Seattle screening shortly.

    from SF to see it. I wouldn't be surprised if we get people come in from various
    places up and down the west coast just to see it.

  body: Update - the delightful Otmar Hoefer will be joining us in Seattle for the
    Q and A with Matthew and Gary after the screening. John Downer will be demonstrating
    his sign painting prowess with a live demo of Helvetica letter painting during
    the festivities. It's going to be quite fun. We are almost out of the public pool
    of tickets, but have a block left for as-yet-to-be-registered TypeCon attendees.
    Designers are coming out in droves, and they are bringing their sweeties, sisters,
    roommates, and, yes, parents!
