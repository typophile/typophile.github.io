cuttlefish: It reads "second" not "two" and is from a list of music pieces. The first number does not refer to it's place in the list.</div>

Not quite right -- or not quite complete. Lining figures were designed to be used with all cap settings, as in 

FRESH MILK $1.39 A GALLON.

Except for a few poets & some typophilers, the rest of the world always throws in a few capitals here & there, even when generally setting "lower case".

There are times, in a cap & l.c. setting, when you would use lining figures, as with newspaper sections, e.g., C1 -- unless you set the "C" in small caps.

But it is the immediate paring without any intervening word space that seems the most determinate factor. I would find it odd (and certainly expensive) to use lining figures to begin a sentence. Do you also use full caps for an acronym that begins a sentence, if the same acronym is set in small caps when it falls in the middle of a sentence? If so, maybe the some stylistic logic would also have you set lining figures at the beginning of a sentence. I doubt it would result in serious jail time.</div>

I'm not asking specifically for my situation. (I was allowed to write it out differently, which I'll prefer doing the next time a number ends up there as well.) Just wanted your opinion on the matter.</div>
