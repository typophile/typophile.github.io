  body: "Hmm, hard to tell from this sample, but some \"details\" remind me of <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-kabel/ultra/\">Kabel Ultra</a>.
    \r\n\r\nEDIT: Ha, same minute. Well, just wanted to link to fontshop.com. Is it
    possible that fontshop has NO (in words zero) kabel-typefaces available? Well,
    at least when I search for \"kabel\" the search brings nothing, nichts, nada,
    rien. For me. Hmm. Can't believe that. What did I do wrong?\r\n\r\nEDIT2: Hmm,
    seems I have difficulties to search at fontshop.com. Is that just me? At <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.at/fontdetailc.php3?ns=&sns=&co=&co2=&id=fp-C68-g0102\">fontshop.at</a>
    everything\u2019s fine, but no wonder different site \u2026"
