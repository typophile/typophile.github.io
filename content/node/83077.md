body: "I'm looking for a font similar to the one used for the logo of http://www.vimeo.com.
  \ I've seen the font before but Can't remember where.  As an example if you look
  at the letter \"i\" in the word Vimeo at the top it curves to the left and at the
  bottom it curves to the right.. I'm just looking for a similar font that looks neater
  than this one\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Are there any fonts where the "i" is straight but has the curves on the upper
    left and lower right? '
