body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nLong time admirer of Typophile and first time posting. I'm hoping
  someone may be able to help identify this font.\r\n\r\nFound in the London College
  of Communication letterpress room. It is a wonderfully shadowed woodcut face that
  is stamped with the makers mark Bonnewell & Co. London. Research has lead me to
  the cutter William Henry Bonnewell, whom I believe published it under Caxton Letter
  Works, Holborn, London c.1950.\r\n\r\nThere's rumour about an 'inner' cut as well,
  and I'd love to know the name of it.\r\n\r\nI've printed most of the alphabet, and
  have today drawn a vector of 'E' for the identity I intend to use it for. This may
  be of help to you.\r\n\r\nBest of luck, let me know if there's anything more I can
  do.\r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\n\r\nMather\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/woodcut-type_2_5296.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen-shot-2011-06-22-at-18_5095.39.jpg]"
