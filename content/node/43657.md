  taxes for free (TurboTax is 30,000 or less).\r\nhttp://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=118986,00.html\r\n\r\nand
  if you live in California and you made less than 155,416 you can file your state
  taxes for free.\r\nhttp://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/calfile/qualifications.shtml\r\n\r\nOf
  course you still have to pay the government but at least you don\u2019t have to
  pay to file.\r\n\r\nHeck, Buy some fonts with the you\u2019ve money saved by filing
  yourself.\r\n\r\nHope this helps some of guys and gals out there,\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    taxes?\r\n\r\nI just spent several hours over Easter to fill in our tax forms
    (the business one + a personal one for both my husband and I), and expect to hear
    from the taxman around september if we're paying more or getting something back."

    through commercial filing services. It\u2019s free to file electronically now,
    but the filing services have bribed our crooked government to ensure that if you
    have money, it\u2019s enough of a pain that you\u2019ll pay someone else to do
    it. Although most people with money just have accountants doing it all anyway."
