    textura blackletter style is the closest I could find (and the |a| isn\u2019t
    a match):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nonpareille/hans/\r\n\r\nOther, mostly

  body: "We recently had a couple of threads on this kind of beer-label-simplified-National-like-engentled-blackletters.
    It turns out that, while it\u2019s a quite common style of lettering, it appears

    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/brauhaus/\r\nStretch Brauhaus horizontally
