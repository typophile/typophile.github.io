  this year? (Well, you almost managed. You'd think with the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/calendar/\">updated
  calendar</a> it wouldn't have gone by at all!)\r\n\r\nWishing for you the happiest
  belated birthday!!"

  body: "Paul, for sure. Everybody else, thank you!\r\n\r\nI was in the UK last week,
    and had a delightful time.\r\n\r\nA lot of type designers seem to share birthdays,
    Alessandro. December 4th is also Jean-Fran\xE7ois Porchez's birthday (Joyeux anniversaire,
    JFP!). And Nadine Chahine and Hermann Zapf also share the same birthday (which
    is in early November\u2026). Plus, we just learned that Richard Kegler and Rudolf
    Koch were born on the same day."

    seeing as how she works for Linotype!\r\nBTW, I was born hours after Cassandre
    killed himself.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
