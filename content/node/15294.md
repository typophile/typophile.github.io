    & the site is fun, too. Mostly display, pi & fun fonts. You have to love someone
    who calls one of his fonts \"Wild Monkeys\".\r\n\r\nhttp://www.astigmatic.com/"

    style and quality. If you think these are too pricy, I guess you're in trouble?!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fountain.nu\r\nhttp://www.psyops.com\r\nhttp://www.stormtype.com\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: Wow, that's a big chunk of typefaces for just 99 "bucks". Even if some of
    them are hard to find us for in "normal" production. Still a very good offer.

  body: "A \u201Cmodest price\u201D is quite a relative definition, I agree with you
    on that Kyle. I meant to ask \u2014what's the latest type you've seen that you
    thought was a good deal?\u2014 It can be any price as long as you don't have to
    morgage your house.\r\n\r\nThanks to all for your links."

  body: "Any thoughts and recommendations?\r\n\r\nOne of my favourite faces is Weiss.
    Its hugely elegant and legible, a great '20's feel - not surprising as was designed
    then. But it never seems to figure on anyone's list of favourites, and I wonder
    why not?\r\nIs it just me?\r\n\r\nAnother face, but one I covet as it is expensive,
    is Sabon Next. I have seen it in pdf and in a book and think it is great. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    has anyone a recommendation for a good old workhorse, much preferable to Times,
    namely Plantin? I have it with WordPerfect , but wonder if anyone has a particular
    interpretation they like.\r\nThanks"

    Font Set</a>. 527 fonts for $952. It doesn't include the latest Storm fonts, but
    I think it's still a great deal.\r\n\r\n"

  body: i think all of [[Storm Type Foundry|Storm]]'s packages are all tremendous
    bargains, esp since i think their library is THE top of the line. I've been eyeing
    the <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/SOL.html">Storm Open Library</a>, as it's
    a good solid mix of styles all in OT format with all the bells and whistles including
    [[small caps]], [[oldstyle figures]], &c.

    This <a href=http://www.fontworks2.type.co.uk/fw/shop/catalog?action=zoom&rt=012889000>Linotype
    essentials</a> looks like a good deal for only \xA3349 (US$ 619 or \u20AC514).
    What do you think about their offers in general?"
