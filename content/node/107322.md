body: "Hello,\r\nI would like to hear an opinion about a logo that I designed for
  my laboratory, which is a Physics laboratory in which we use ion beams to analyze
  materials.\r\nI am not a professional designer, I just like to tinker a bit with
  graphics, so any suggestion or critic will be appreciated.\r\nBy the way I was not
  appointed to design it, I am just doing it for fun and I will probably not even
  show it to the director.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the logo is that a beam of particles,
  that are represented by the dots, comes from left, passes behind the first letters,
  and hits the left 'l.' The hit then scatters the particles in other directions.
  The colors are the colors of the university in which I am working.\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

    access recently.\r\n\r\nI like your concept. You might experiment with making
    the dots vary in shade (ones on the left light, ones on the right becoming darker)
    to create a feeling of motion. Don't know if that will help or not, but you might
    try it.  "

    on paper i really like animated logos like this one: http://wims.unice.fr/~wims/en_tool~linear~matmult.html
    (see the hypocycloid on the top left). if it''s for particles why don''t use something
    close to an old bubble chamber picture? <img src="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/bubblechamber/bubblePRN.jpg">

    dots [vertically] similar to the space between the letters... If that makes sense!\r\n\r\nJ"
