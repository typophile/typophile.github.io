body: I bought a book this morning and really like the typeface used in the titles.
  Unfortunately, What the Font has fallen short and I haven't had any luck elsewhere.
  Any help would be appreciated.. Most typefaces I find in similar styles have 'a's
  that I'm not fond of (don't like the 'circle with a straight stick' look).

  body: Wow that was quick.. Typ1451 appears to be it. It's a shame it's so expensive
    - a little much for use in a portfolio like I was pondering. Thanks for the help.
