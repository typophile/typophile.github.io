  assignment: use one of Bruce Mau's statements written down in his Incomplete Manifesto
  for Growth (http://www.brucemaudesign.com/manifesto.html) into a poster.\r\nIt should
  be all based on typography, so no use of images.\r\n\r\nAfter some sketchwork (scissors&paper),
  I tried to work things out in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nDoes it work, do you think? And
  if so, what about position of the shapes, colour, size? Is there anything I could
  improve?"

  body: "just two quick things:\r\nThe space between the 3rd and the 4th seems to
    be smaller than the first few. The same goes for the space above the red text.\r\nAlso,
    you might want to move the \"cut\" a bit up/down for the first/last line so the
    \"e\" gets cut over right under/over the horizontal line. \r\nOtherwise I think
    it looks good!"
