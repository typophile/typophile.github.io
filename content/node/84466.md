  create a typface  with the same flow as Infinity but with a more square feel. I
  have also given a link to the typeface at the bottom of my message. Any critique
  would be highly appreciated. Thanks for your time everyone :) \r\n  \r\nhttp://freetypography.com/2011/04/04/free-font-infinity/

    but start from scratch your own typeface, instead of doing a variation of another
    one."
