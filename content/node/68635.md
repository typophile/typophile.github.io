  was conceived as non-connected, high-contrast and ultra heavy script, as best exemplified
  by the Black weight. However, it was too much of a temptation to design a hairline
  variant, and this exploration gave the family\u2019s lighter weights an elegant,
  graceful feel. The script was modified further to use connected letterforms as the
  primary glyphs. With its unique swirled ball terminals, this versatile script draws
  immediate attention. The face glides and flows across the page and the swirling
  ball terminals provide an interesting diversion to the flow. The lighter weights
  have an almost spencerian look.\r\nSildetas includes six weights and is a very unique
  script face. Lighter weights can be used for elegant invitiations. Sildetas can
  get the job done for many unique design tasks.\r\n\r\nSildetas includes many useful
  OpenType features, including a set of non-connecting and titling alternates, ligatures,
  and two types of end swashes. Opentype features include simplified swashed stylistic
  alternates without ball terminals, swash endings, ending contextual alternates,
  discretionary ligatures, ligatures and five different stylistic sets filled with
  alternates. In total, there are over 60 alternate letterforms.\r\n\r\nOpenType-capable
  applications such as Quark or the Adobe suite can take full advantage of the automatically
  replacing ligatures and alternates. This family also includes the glyphs to support
  a wide range of languages.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/sildetas/|Sildetas
