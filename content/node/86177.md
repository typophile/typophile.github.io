  body: "Very interesting.  In English, the comma usually (but not always) goes inside
    the quotation marks, <cite> Lady,\" </cite> not <cite> Lady\", </cite> but there
    are exceptions, so it's probably necessary to kern both ways round.\r\nI had no
    idea that those 'low-9' quotation marks went before the text. I'll have to remember
    that!\r\nMaybe I'll just stick everything in classes and kern every eventuality
    just in case."

  body: Comma placement also depends on the audience. Hacker types are sensitive to
    this, since punctuation in the wrong place can foul up a computer manual quite
    badly. See [[http://www.catb.org/jargon/|the Jargon File]] for more.
