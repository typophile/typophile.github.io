  body: "<cite>OK, I thought that the name of this font was Commercial Gothic.</cite>\r\nThere
    is a freeware font calling itself [[http://www.dafont.com/media-gothic.font|Media
    Gothic]] which looks like a copy of Engravers Gothic given a slightly heavier
    weight. They haven't even bothered to give it numerals.\r\n\r\nDid you find this
    old thread when searching \"commercial gothic\"?\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/16092]]"

  body: Media Gothic is similar, but not the same. Look at the diagonals of the M,
    for example.
