  body: I very much doubt that this is a font; it's almost certainly hand-lettered.
    If you want an exact copy of it, you'll have to use Illustrator or FontLab to
    trace it, or create a high-res version in Photoshop. You might be able to find
    some script fonts that are reminiscent of it, though. Off the top of my head,
    <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000173>Whomp</a>
    from Sudtipos has a similar feel, although it's a bit quirkier than your logo.
