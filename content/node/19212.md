  it a lot. One thing that upsets me though is the oldstyle zero, which looks kind
  of unfinished to me. It looks like a perfect circle, with no 'shape' or modulation.
  Does it look odd to anyone else? The first time I saw it in print I thought it was
  a mistake.\r\n\r\nI've tried to attach a scan, but I'm not convinced it's going
  to show up. You can also find one here:\r\n\r\nhttp://store.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/garamond/garamond.html\r\n\r\nToby"

    Check out Carter's Big Caslon. The design reflects earlier attitudes about the
    number zero itself. Western mathematics was not comfortable with the concept of
    zero for some time, and felt that it was not a number in the usual sense.\r\n\r\nYou
    can always substitute a lc \"o\"."

  body: "It's a sophisticated form.\r\nIt makes aesthetic sense in faces such as Garamond
    that have long thin stems in various characters, such as the upper case M and
    N, and the em dash, and especially the 4 and 7, where the long thin stem has no
    finial. Because of these other instances, it is not an isolated quirk, but shares
    an element of the face's graphic language."

    is 15th century, so the issue of the acceptance of zero is unlikely to be involved
    in the circular old style zero. I think it is for typographic reasons, to prevent
    confusion with the cap, small cap and lc 'o'. It is generally not, in fact, a
    perfect circle, though it is more circular than any of the o's. "

    to consider that Indian numerals changed the whole concept of mathematics (especially
    for more complex mathematics than adding and subtracting). Taking into account
    resistance to Fibonacci's <em>upstart</em> system and the generations that would
    need to pass before enough teachers were able to teach the system to enough pupils
    to make the system widely understood and accepted. Added to that would be the
    clergy wishing to retain reading as their skill.\r\nTim\r\nbtw William, your link

  body: The ring zero is one of the ways in which type designers at different times
    have tried to resolve the problem of confusion of lowercase o and oldstyle zero.
    It is a problem that has never been really adequately resolved, and we rely heavily
    on context to distinguish these two characters. In historic revival projects such
    as Garamond Pro, the designer has to ask 'Should I follow the approach of the
    original to this problem, or should I try to come up with my own solution'. The
    answer in most revivals seems to be to follow the original; after all, the selling
    point of the design is that it is a revival of something e.g. cut by Claude Garamond
    in the 16th century.

    don't have to \"resolve\" anything to simply make the situation less bad.\r\n\r\n>
    the selling point of the design is that it is a revival of something\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, it's an interesting question whether the user (generally\r\na
    layman) bases his opinions on that micro level of detail. Certainly some\r\nusers
    do, but I think they're rare. Much more common I think is the user who\r\nwill
    say it's ugly/wrong when (more likely, if) it's brought to his attention.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I am one of those rare users, but I'd think now that we have OT we should
    be able to have more than that 0 for use. I'm all for historical accuracy, but
    this 0 is not attractive. Unless I'm shooting for some sort of pretention I don't
    find it to be a useful glyph. A single flaw in an otherwise gorgeous family. I
    do realize that there are lining figures to be used, but an alternate old style
    0 would be wonderful.
