  body: "Berthold Garamond. But the italic is a little too dark. Today I\u2019d rather
    prefer Adobe Garamond or Garamond Premier (because of the optical sizes). Amongst
    German typographers, Sabon was long considered as the \u2018better German Garamond\u2019.
    Probably because Tschichold touched it with his aura. I never got this, because
    even in the days of phototypesetting neither Stempel, nor Linotype or Monotype
    cared to restore the italic. It had always been far too wide in order to fit it
    on the same widths as the roman due to Linotype\u2019s duplex matrices. Even today
    one can easily pee through the holes on the lines as caused by the \u2018o\u2019
    being far too wide. So in the end, maybe Sabon Next is now the better \u2018European\u2019
    Garamond?\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI think Sabon Next deserves a Sans companion, based on
    Tschicholds Uhertype and/or the sketches he once made for Stempel."

  body: "Sabon was an interesting attempt to provide a common typeface that could
    be used on Monotype and Linotype machines. Of course, in being both unitized and
    having the same widths for different weights, Sabon was similar to all the typefaces
    designed specifically to be used with the IBM Selectric Composer.\r\n\r\nThey,
    of course, didn't have the magical aura of Jan Tschichold, although while Press
    Roman and Theme, for example, were just copies of Times Roman and Optima, it did
    have an officially licensed Univers, adjusted for the Selectric Composer by Adrian
    Fruitger himself IIRC.\r\n\r\nJournal Roman was IBM's take on Garamond.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JournalRoman_Italic_3732.jpg]\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the word \"of\" in the italic, it apparently is considerably worse than Sabon
    in this particular respect.\r\n\r\nActually, the problem with Journal Roman is
    visible in any word containg an o. In Sabon, on the other hand, the o is simply
    made large and round, to fill the space assigned to it, instead of being only
    partly widened and left to have extra space around it, in order to somewhat resemble
    the narrow o of the real Garamond italic, as was done in Journal Roman."

    is especially strange because Stempel used to have an extra design of Sabon italic
    for the larger sizes of their hand setting version (24 points and larger if I

    I\u2019ve seen that, but to me it does not qualify as Sabon (Next) Sans. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>The

    true! The j is not much better \u2026\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Maybe... because all

    it is the other way round. Stempel Garamond (1924) is much older that Berthold
    Garamond (1972). ITC Garamond from 1977, but its italic is far too wide too."

      just saying that before, when I was still a novice playing with Times New Roman

      Sabon and Lyon?"
