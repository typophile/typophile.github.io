  asked a question, \"What role do we as designers play in our society?\" I was reading
  a similar blog on this website and there were well informed and very useful comments
  that were insightful. Then there was a lot of bla bla bla about junk. The point
  of me asking this question is to engage designers in asking themselves this question.
  We can all be cynical and say that you work in books because you would be selling
  your soul in advertising. But as a student I feel like most of what I am reading
  I feel is jaded.\r\n\r\n Please feel free to post something in responce, to help
  a student gain insight into this wounderful field."

  body: "Yes, to design things. Not more, not less.\r\n\r\nBut what is the reasoning
    behind it? I would say: to make things needed as good as possible, in order to
    benefit those who need them / use them."

  body: "@SaveGirl101: Who asked you this question and to what end? Is this a personal
    or academic project?\r\n\r\nTry looking at:\r\n\r\nBerman, D. B. (2009). <em><a
    href=\"http://www.davidberman.com/social/dogood.php\">Do good design. How designers
    can change the world.</a></em> Berkely, California: Peachpit.\r\n\r\nIn addition,
    you\u2019ll find you get a better response to broad questions like this if you
    provide specific examples of what you\u2019ve come so far, where you\u2019ve looked,
    and why you are asking the question. A straight out question from a profile that\u2019s
    hours old has the potential to come across as a little bit of \u201Cdo my homework.\u201D"

  body: SaveGirl101, you mention "leadership" in your subject title but don't mention
    it again in your question. Are you asking if designers should be leaders in society?
    And what type of designers are you referring to -- type designers, graphic designers,
    designers at ad agencies, or what? Please clarify. Thanks.
