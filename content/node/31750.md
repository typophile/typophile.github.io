body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nLooking for some recommendations for a body font for promotional
  material I am designing for a new play. The play is a science fiction piece, with
  strong female central characters and feminist themes. I was looking at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dooleytype/chennai/\">Chennai</a>,
  but some of the characters dont look too well drawn to me, and I was wondering if
  this was a knock-off of something else, or if there is a better font available in
  this same vein.\r\n\r\nDoesn't necessarily need to be sans serif, but I think sans
  may be best to communicate a \"futuristic\" feel.\r\n\r\nAll suggestions are appreciated!"

    Rounded</a> if you like rounded letters.\r\n\r\nOne that just occurred to me is
    <a href=http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=kautiva&producttype=TYP&pricemodel=RM%2CRF>Kautiva</a>.
    It seems to me to have a vaguely futuristic feel to it, although I'm not positive
    if it feels very feminine."

    However, I'm not positive if any of the typefaces that have been mentioned by
    Lex and I would be terrific for extended reading, though they might be fine for
    your short promotional text.\r\n\r\nEdit: Forgot the link to <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/triplex-italic/>Triplex
    Italic</a> -- otherwise you might have thought Triplex was italic-less."

    Could work."
