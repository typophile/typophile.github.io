  body: I wish I had a more informed opinion. I was kind of forced into Suitcase and
    find that it works fine, although it&#39;s slow. It&#39;s slow to launch and it
    must be open in the background all the time &#40;unlike the old ATM Deluxe under
    OS 9&#41;. The newest version of Suitcase auto-activates fonts in Illustrator
    only. &#40;FontReserve doesn&#39;t auto-activate faces from any app.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>I would love to know what FontReserve users think. <BR> <BR>I wonder if the
    folks at <a href="http://www.atmforosx.com" target="_blank">http://www.atmforosx.com</a>
    have given up on their petition yet.

  body: I&#39;ve been very happy with Suitcase. The fact that it runs as an application
    is a due to the nature of OS X and Unix; this was not a decision made by the Suitcase
    programmers. <BR> <BR>You can make it work more like an earlier Mac extension,
    however. In Suitcase&#39;s preferences, click on &#39;open automatically when
    I log in,&#39; then you don&#39;t have to ever launch it manually, again. Next,
    open your System Preferences and select &#39;Login Items&#39; &#40;it&#39;s under
    &#39;Personal&#39;&#41;. Make sure that the box next to Suitcase is checked &#40;under
    &#39;hide&#39;&#41;. This will cause Suitcase to remain hidden, even though it&#39;s
    running. When you log in or start your computer, Suitcase will launch automatically,
    but stay invisibly in the background. The only indication you&#39;ll have that
    it&#39;s running is that the Suitcase icon in your Dock will have the little triangle
    next to it. <BR> <BR>When you want to load or unload a font, simply click on the
    icon in the Dock, or else create a keyboard shortcut in Suitcase&#39;s own preferences
    &#40;in which case, you can delete the Dock icon&#41;. <BR> <BR>Whenever  you&#39;re
    finished loading or unloading fonts, simply hit &#39;command-h&#39; to re-hide
    Suitcase. Now you can completely ignore it and will never see it, unless you need
    it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been really impressed with the way it interfaces with Classic
    applications - there is an extension for your Classic system folder, and the OS
    X application and Classic extension talk to each other, so that the OS X Suitcase
    app can pass fonts to the OS 9 extension. The OS 9 extension doesn&#39;t even
    have a control panel - you still load or unload fonts with the OS X app. <BR>
    <BR>I have a font folder at the root level of my Home folder, with all my fonts
    organized in subfolders within <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Re: ATMforOSX.org <BR> <BR>The site is still going, with al the petition
    names being forwarded to Adobe in late January.  Although the decision to wait
    has largely been informed by a lack of time on the part of the developers of the
    site, its is still an important project for both of them. <BR> <BR>In terms of
    Font Management tools... both Suitcase and FontReserve work well.  Most people
    I have talked to like Suitcase a little better for the way it displays loaded
    fonts. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Font Reserve work well here for last couple of months under MacX. Auto activation
    for various appl. To me, its close to ATMdeluxe that I used before. And as I never
    wanted to comeback to Suitcase, I like Font Reserve who is developed by a font
    company, so to me its another good reason to trust it.
