  body: It's VERY difficult to tell because the image is so small, but it might be

  body: "Sorry about the low res image...\r\nAttached you\xB4ll see the original image.
    It\xB4s a little bit better. But just a little bit...\r\n\r\nSerif Gothic is close,
    it might be the one. But looking at it a bit bigger, I think I`m after something
    with a bit less pronounced serifs. Anyone got any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5439.png]"
