  much response there, so I'm reposting here.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for someone
  to (letterpress) print some business cards for me. I\u2019d prefer a local company
  (Los Angeles, USA). It seems like <a href=\"http://www.aardvarkletterpress.com/\">Aardvark
  Letterpress</a> is pretty well respected.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone recommend a different
  company or have any comments or advice on where to go? It doesn't necessarily have
  to be local, but I would prefer if it were.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
