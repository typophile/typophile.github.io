  on my new typeface <em>Minors advanced</em>. This sans serif character is indeed
  a very old one (of mines) on which I did modifications that changed its look. I
  wanted to add to it more fashionable elegance, more in the direction of Franklin
  gothic feeling, clear and charming forms.\r\nOn my table I kept an old ad campaign
  of Giorgio Armani of 2003 photographed by Paolo Roversi and an open Dior book which
  contains a beautiful Didot character. I search for inspiration in them to turn the
  character of the face into something more stylish even keeping it a sans serif face.

  picture while working on the \u2018s\u2019. I find it personally hard to do the
  downwards swelling. It tends to go up on the right side. Yet, I tried to keep it
  symmetrical. This keeps it somewhat warmer in feeling. The hidden photograph also
  is by Paolo Roversi.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Image_Zs_weiter.gif\"

    the curves connect at the flag. The /S/ has a somewhat forced diagonal.\r\n\r\n[You
    could do far worse than using P. Roversi as an inspiration\u2026! ; ) ]"

  body: "Thanks a lot for visiting my blog, Bert, and your critics, too.\r\nHits me
    because I particularly like the \u2018g\u2019 for its liveliness in forms, specially
    in the head (yet it keeps elegance)\r\n\r\nBut I am looking forward to all comments
    and hope to see you again here!\r\n\r\nPaolo is great indeed. It helps me a lot
    to look at the forms of the body that he does inscene so sensitively. I am absolutely
    convinced of him of being one (if not THE) greatest photographer of our time.\r\n\r\nsalutes\r\nStefan"
