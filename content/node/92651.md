  of this logo in \"Spirit of Kent\" but so far my attempts have proved unfruitful.\r\nI
  think the K is particularly identifiable.\r\n\r\nLogo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ks_logo_master_small_6379.jpg]\r\n\r\nStraightened
  extract (t, o, f and K):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_4526.jpg]\r\n\r\n(If
  anyone also recognises the font used for \"THE KENT SPITFIRE that could also come
  in handy although I've already found 2 close matches: \r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=CG+Alpin+Gothic+No.+1&q=Go\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=Titling+Gothic+Compressed&q=Go
  )\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)"

  body: "Brilliant :D Thank you very much!\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to see if someone
    with that prog can find a better match for the font used at the top of that logo
    than the one I found but I'll make a new thread. My hopes aren't high though as
    the letters I've got to work with are all pretty standard (the P is the only one
    that seems to stand out in its condensed form).\r\n\r\nEdit: URL - http://typophile.com/node/92657"
