  out four equilateral triangles, what angle do I cut the edge at to make sure the
  sides fit together?\r\n\r\nit isn't a 45 degree angle is it?"

  body: "Are you making a five-sided pyramid (with a square base) or a four-sided
    pyramid (triangular base)? I guess, since you mention 45\xBA, that it is the former.
    The trouble you face is that compound angle cuts are required.\r\nThe formula
    you need is here\r\nhttp://www.woodcentral.com/bparticles/miter_formula.shtml\r\n\r\nbtw
    45\xBA is certainly not correct.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: '45% could be correct for the sides of a triangle-base pyramid (though not
    the base), but it all depends on the proportions of your cube. '

    \ whats the easiest way to make a three or four sided pyramid?"

  body: "Depending on how flexible you are, I would take a piece of wood about 12
    inches long* and 3 inches wide and deep, make a mark 2.6 inches from one end on
    each face and using an accurate table saw with a mitre guide set at 30\xBA from
    right angles to the saw blade and make four cuts, one on each plane, finally cut
    at right angles to the blade to remove the excess.\r\nThe efficacy of this is
    going to depend on the quality of the wood and saw (and your measurements [and
    my maths, so double check before you cut], in spite of your best efforts the saw
    might still remove the tip).\r\nThe chances of creating a pyramid of such a small
    size with wood 3/4 inch thick accurately are slim. Why are you making one? ceremonial
    burial of a scarab beetle?\r\nQuick illustration of what I mean\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pyramid_6621.gif]\r\n\r\nTim\r\n*
    long enough to be able to hold it firmly against the guide and not remove any
    fingers."

  body: "The side should form a 60\xBA angle with the base.\r\n\r\nSuppose the length
    of an edge on such a pyramid is 2. Then each equilateral triangle has legth of
    side 2 and altitude sqrt(3). (Where sqrt is the square root.) If you were to slice
    the pyramid vertically along a plane containing the center and one edge, you would
    obtain a 2 by sqrt(3) by sqrt(3) isoceles triangle where the angle between the
    sides of length sqrt(3) is the angle you need. Applying the Law of Cosines to
    this triangle gives the angle as 60\xBA.\r\n\r\nThis angle will be the same regardless
    of the size you choose.\r\n\r\nThis may be difficult to visualize but I'm not
    good enough in Illustrator to draw it out.\r\n\r\nSo to ensure that it fits together
    properly with the sides joining to form an edge of the pyramid, you will need
    to cut each side at 30\xBA (the two together will form the 60\xBA whole).\r\n\r\nD
