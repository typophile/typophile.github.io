body: What typefaces came out this year that could be called &#34;The Best of 2003?&#34;
  I&#39;m not suggesting we repeat which faces won awards &#40;but don&#39;t rule
  them out either&#41;. Just tell us which faces deserved our attention. <BR> <BR>_
  Make sure it was released in 2003. <BR>_ Post images if you have them. <BR>_ Say
  which category it&#39;s in &#40;revival, text, display, etc.&#41; <BR>_ Tell us
  why. <BR>_ Post a URL to the site or foundry.

    target="_blank"> Amplitude</a> and <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?fontname=Whitman"
    target="_blank"> Whitman</a>, both from FontBureau, are just wonderful. <BR> <BR>Amplitude,
    a sans with &#39;traps&#39; used as decorative elements is very widely usable,
    I think, but has a fresh and unique look, fascinating to the eye. <BR> <BR>Whitman,
    a serifed text face, manages to be calm, graceful and crisp at the same time.
    Influenced by Dwiggins, but fresh and different. I hope it will turn out to be
    a favorite for books. <BR>

  body: The rather boringly named but very beautiful and useful &#39;Arabic Typesetting&#39;,
    designed by Mamoun Sakkal and Paul Nelson for Microsoft. It isn&#39;t shipping
    yet, so far as I know, but it was completed this year and was one of the winners
    in the last TDC type design competition. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22349.gif"
    alt="Arabic Typesetting"> <BR> <BR>Full disclosure probably requires that I mention
    that I designed what I think is a competent and attractive Latin for this typeface,
    but it&#39;s really all about the Arabic which is not only a fine design but also
    an incredibly complex and clever piece of OpenType work.

  body: 'Oh, I think that <a href="http://www.linotype.com/15525/optimanovaredesign-doc.html"
    target="_blank"> Optima Nova</a> was released this year. I&#39;ve always admired
    Optima in signage, but in small sizes I thought it suffered by its color being
    too grey and dull. The new version solves the problems of weight and spacing,
    and adds a true italic. I don&#39;t know if this counts as new, or a revival.
    I am happy that Zapf had the opportunity, with his collaborator, to improve this
    classic design for the digital age.  '

    work in many situations. I haven&#39;t tried it yet, as it&#39;s a little out

    out of whack. I have no problem spending &#40;or billing a client&#41; a few hundred
    for a new face, but $1620 US? That&#39;s a bit much. Clients who would understand

    <BR>Locator, while influenced by Frutiger, like tons of others, manages to have

    agree with Hrant that Lingua and Amplitude are very original. I just think that
