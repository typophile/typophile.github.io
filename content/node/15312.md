body: "hello\r\nthis is my eeemm typeface called \" the great i.t.\",\r\nbecause it
  is derived from a logo i made for the world famous \r\nelectronic music group. i.e.,
  a friends project. this logo is attached, as well.\r\n\r\nthe forms are very simple,and
  very thin,\r\nso it is like the basic idea and form half finished:\r\nuppercase
  letters have an exoskeleton, lowercase letters a endoskeleton,...\r\n\r\ni hope
  for input, i need to hear what you typophiles think about my great i.t.\r\ni am
  prepared for all kind of support,\r\nand rotten tomatoes, as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    traps -- why did you remove those?

  body: "David,\r\nI think you have to decide between making all the glyphs the same
    width or the same stem width.  The E look very wide and the V and W look tiny
    and lost. You might want to limit diagonals to one or 2 angles.  You might also
    use 2 different line weights, one to define the left side and one to define the
    right.  This may not work either.  I am just trying to figure a way for glyphs
    to differentiate more.\r\nYou have tried a very tough problem but when you solve
    it, the result will look quite simple.  Keep at it.  Perhaps try some unusual
    grids to base it on.\r\nI think Tiff is right about the triangles.  They were
    helpful in differentiating glyphs as well as giving it a very unique look.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
