body: "I have an ink jet printed envelope dated March 2006. \r\nThere are 28 characters.
  25 agree with the above mentioned types but the troublesome characters are the comma
  [,] the zero [0] and possibly the seven [7]. \r\n-The form of the comma disagrees
  completely. \r\n-The zero is elevated above the baseline on the envelope and\r\n-The
  seven appears to extend slightly below the baseline.\r\n\r\nThe agreeing characters
  are:\r\nAabCdehikLlMnorStuvWwy.14\r\n\r\nAny ideas what this typestyle is? \r\nOr...what
  could cause these variations if there is not a different agreeing typestyle?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nKatherine\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comma_4848.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numbers_4020.jpg]"

    Cochin doesn't agree with the rest of the characters...are both Nicolas Cochin

    March 2006. Due to case confidentiality I can't go into details but it is not
    likely that the Type was altered in just those minor areas. However, if it is
    a 'homemade' Type then it would make it individualizable which could identify
    a person/computer!!\r\n\r\nThe rest of the document is consistent with Koch Antiqua
    and Eva Antiqua.\r\nA few more character samples:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/W_3605.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avenue_6447.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ms_5150.jpg]"

    Yes, March 2006. Due to case confidentiality I can\u2019t go into details but

  body: "Bitstream had a version of Koch they named Kuenstler 165 Roman which is also
    known as your already mentioned Koch Antiqua. The letter d seems to match up -
    as well as the numbers. The only \"off\" I can see from your copied sample (I'm
    assuming this was on a piece of paper scanned in which is why the gray background
    and the thickness to the letters) would be the comma. Though the comma looks a
    bit out of place -- as it seems to appear heavier that then letter/numbers sampled.
    Maybe it's just me, and the fact that I should be asleep.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have
    seen that comma before... now if only I could remember where...\r\n\r\nBTW - you
    may want to check out the lower case letter O o for your \"zero.\""

    program? Or would the person have to go through effort to add them to his/her
    computer? (I have Microsoft Word 2000 on a three yr old computer which doesn't
    have either types.) As of now, the case is a 'fishing' expedition...trying to
