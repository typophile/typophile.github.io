  body: "> <em>Done by machine. I do believe.</em>\r\n\r\n> <em>What's that mean?</em>\r\n\r\nWhat
    Tiff means is that this kind of lettering is output device-specific: it is a set
    of characters that is produced specifically for a certain type of stamping machine.
    This means it originally had no equivalent in what we know as \"type\". These
    alphabets only existed for stamping machines to make these train station signs.
    Some of them were digitised <em>afterwards</em>, like Tobias Frere-Jones did with
    the American Highway type and Rian Hughes with the British Ministry of Transport
    face. But they made a selection of character shapes and changed them where they
    deemed it necessary, so you won't find an exacty match to your examples.\r\n\r\nOther
    examples are alphabets available for the stamping machines that produce automobile
    license plates, for sowing and embroidery machines, for stone engraving et al.
    It just is a different world. In some rare cases you\u2019ll find alphabets that
    have digital font counterparts, but more often than not they will be unique to
    that reproduction system."
