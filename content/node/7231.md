  <BR> <BR>LAKE FOREST -- The Washington Post trumpeted Joe Gibbs&#39; return to coach
  the Redskins after a 12-year absence with a typeface generally reserved for the
  outbreak of wars.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.rrstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041016/SPORTS10/410160308/1001/SPORTS"

  body: I think they meant the weight, height, and gusto of the headline, not the
    specific typeface that was used... I might be wrong, but the context of the article
    seems to imply that the announcement of Gibbs&#39; return is as big an event as
    the announcement of a new war.
