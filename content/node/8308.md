  body: I don&#39;t know. <BR>The photo in the original seems to be just an excuse
    to grab attention through skin. It has nothing to do with boredom, no matter how
    hard that waif is trying. As for the blackletter title, it could be good, but
    it depends on the what the magazine is about. If it&#39;s just an attempt at being
    hip then that&#39;s merely a cheap shot in the same way as the photo is. Man,
    this is why I love graphic designers - their navels are the core of the world...

  body: 'The first one is indeed the best, in my opinion. And the reason for that
    is the way the photograph gets the message across. It is an interesting image
    which makes you wonder - always a good thing. <BR> <BR>Since this image works
    well, I think you shouldn&#39;t let typography get in the way too much. As it
    is, all kinds of fonts and typographic treatments compete for attention, and the
    end result lacks uniformity because of this. <BR> <BR>So some suggestions: <BR>-
    Try using one font for all the lettering; this may feel slightly boring, but isn&#39;t
    that exactly what this cover is about? <BR>- Try moving &#39;not with&#39; lines
    to the bottom, to maximize the effect of the photograph <BR>- Treat the title
    of the magazine more like a logo instead of two fonts next to each other.  <BR>
    <BR>Good luck!'

  body: thanks Bart.v.d.G <BR> <BR>do you think Compacta Italic would work well or
    shall i stick to a normal font like Ariel? <BR> <BR>im also thinking of removing
    the background and megering an illustration on to cover... any tips on how i should
    go about doing that? i need to have a mixture of photography and illustration
    on the cover you see
