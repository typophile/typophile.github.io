body: "I have a vague memory of a book that was available on line (and may still be)
  whose purpose was to help in identificaton of fonts. Each page was set up with a
  grid of maybe 30 squares and in each square was a letter in 60 point or thereabouts.
  Underneath the letter was the typeface name. Apparently this book had pages and
  pages of cap As, then cap Bs, and so on. \r\n\r\nI'm not referring to <strong>Rookledge's
  International Typefinder</strong>. I have that book and find it useful. The book
  I'm vaguely recalling did not have one-line specimens for each typeface, it simply
  had various incarnations of each letter of the alphabet grouped together.\r\n\r\nI
  never actually saw the book and have no idea if it would be helpful. However, one
  of our art directors is looking for info on the book and I seem to have misplaced
  the url or any information about it. \r\n\r\nSo can anyone help an old lady with
  her senior moment? What the heck was that book? Did anyone actually purchase it
  and/or find it useful?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    I don't find it very useful because the selection is slim and outdated and there's
    no logical order to the displays. It only really works when you're trying to identify
    a single distinctive glyph."

  body: "Sure thing. It's sounds like it's actually quite similar to Kristen's book.\r\n\r\nThe
    book is approx 10 1/2 x 8 1/2\", horizontal, hardcover, 416 pages.\r\n \r\nEach
    page has a grid of 35 squares, each containing a capital letter or numeral, at
    about 72 points. There are 8 pages of each letter, so that's 280 typefaces. Each
    square also has a small number which corresponds to a master grid index in the
    back, listing the typeface names and foundries.\r\n\r\nFull lowercase alphabets
    are listed in a separate section, five to a page, again numbered to correspond
    to the grid index.\r\n\r\nThrere's also an alphabetical index at the back.\r\n\r\nI
    can try to post some pictures later if you're interested."
