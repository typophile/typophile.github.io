  body: "German name, perhaps a German font from the era.\r\nBasalt, designed by W.
    Ege for Gensch & Hayse 1927.  It was redesigned in 1934. I suspect the redesigned
    Basalt  is the match. \r\nSee Jaspert's  _Type Enclopaedia (1970) which shows
    the 1927 version of Basalt, with only the word \"ENMITGLIED,\"  which matches
    the Dan X. Solo \"Harmony.\"\r\n"
