  city of Mountain View's annual Art & Wine Festival. I figured I'd take the opportunity
  to do some custom lettering rather than the more conventional logo approach.\r\n\r\nAttached
  is the first idea (of three) I finished. Here are some notes:\r\n\r\n- ALL the text
  you see has to be included, unfortunately. That part isn't negotiable.\r\n- All
  the lettering is custom. Obviously I spent the most time on the \"Art & Wine\" section,
  but the smaller sans and serif blocks of text were done (somewhat hastily) as custom
  lettering as well. There was no real reason, I just thought it'd be fun to do all
  of it \"by hand\"."

    seems to upload fine, but it doesn't appear in the post.
