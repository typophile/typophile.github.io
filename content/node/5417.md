  body: R. A couple of suggestions that apply to you and to alot of other people.
    Consider reading the books, Elements of Typographic style by Robert Bringhurst,
    The New Typogrqaphy by Jan Tshichold, and Treasury of Alphabets and Lettering
    by Jan Tshichold. These books will help you make quality design desicisions based
    on the central principles of typography and graphic design. No the rules before
    you break the rules. As for the logo presented, it kind of reminds me of an acitve
    wear company for lazy men and women. My advice is to dig deep deep deep into your
    soul and you will most likely find the solution you are looking for.

  body: I agree that the symbol needs work. The illustration of the man should probably
    take on more characteristics of the Arabic forms used, to bring a cohesiveness
    to the whole that isn&#39;t quite there yet. The logo you present &#40;the one
    with the small type&#41; is certainly a step in the right direction, but it&#39;s
    a small step. Try ideas that push you far from the original &#40;unless you were
    told not to&#41; and use those new ideas to find a good balance. <BR> <BR>Since
    the symbol seems to be the most important part, I&#39;d focus on that first, and
    let the type choice follow. Also think of ways to mirror curves from the type
    in the symbol, or the symbol in the type.

    questions or thoughts to let us know where you are at in the identity design process
    . . .  <BR> <BR>What do you want the new logo to communicate? Do you want to keep
    a figure similar to the one in the original logo, or is it a possibility to create
    a whole new image? <BR> <BR>Keep experimenting with different logo ideas--maybe
    it would help to post a few logos that are each taken in very different directions
    . . . right now it still seems like you are still at the conceptualizing point
    and it is hard to critique in that situation. <BR> <BR>Overall, from what you
    have posted, the logo looks like it is for something to do with sports, very action-oriented.
    <BR> <BR>Keep working at it!

  body: 'In the West the swoosh is overdone, but maybe in the Middle East it can be
    used to good effect. Although the first thing I think of when I see the logo is
    a fitness club, I like the idea of combining the Arabic &#34;noon&#34; &#40;on
    top, good&#41; and the Latin &#34;n&#34; &#40;although I think you need a small
    stem on the top-left - that would actually be a nice clue that it&#39;s letters
    - otherwise I think it&#39;s too subtle&#41;. <BR> <BR>As for the name settings,
    because Arabic is small on the body you&#39;ll always have some trouble getting
    the relative apparent weight/importance to match up. Your first solution &#40;bigger
    Arabic type, but in a lighter tint&#41; isn&#39;t bad. Although the Kufi style
    matches neither Palatino nor the logo, I don&#39;t think. <BR> <BR>I think Eurostile
    might work &#40;another element overused in the West but maybe OK there&#41;,
    but you need to make a nice-looking Arabic Eurostile match &#40;not what you have
    now&#41;. BTW, if you make an Arabic font to match an existing Latin font, make
    sure not to make it too Latinized - although a little bit is OK here, considering
    the subject. <BR> <BR>BTW, in your setting with the curved text lines top and
    bottom, I&#39;m not sure a kasheeda can go between the &#34;noon&#34; and the
    &#34;daal&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#62; &#34;Bahrain is four seas&#34; <BR> <BR>Not TWO
    seas? The &#34;ain&#34; suffix in Arabic means &#34;two of them&#34;. The singular
    is &#34;bahr&#34;, and the plural &#34;bihaar&#34;, I think. &#40;In Arabic the
    plural of a feminine word gets an &#34;aat&#34; suffix, but masculines are irregular
    - and it can get pretty funny, like when a foreign word gets pluralized: &#34;jante&#34;
    means a car wheel in French, and in Lebanon the plural is either &#34;jnaat&#34;,
    &#34;jantaat&#34;, &#34;janat&#34; or &#34;jnoot&#34; - you can actually tell
    which part of the country somebody&#39;s from depending on how they pluralize
    &#34;jante&#34;. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>If you need further help, you might
    try these two experts: Nadine Chahine, and Habib Khoury. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    like gradiations. They distract from the idea, try your dancing person with a
    double circle around it and loose the gradient. I do like the blue and gray color

    says, avoid the gradations and the circle with relief.  <BR> <BR>Also, why dont

  body: The type is nice and the icon is nice, but I&#39;m not sure that they go together.
    The letterforms are simple and have fairly consistent weight, while the icon is
    a little more complex and has significant weight variance. Have you tried knocking
    the figure out of a solid gray oval? I think that would be a good start in simplifying
    the icon to a level consistent with the type. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

    hosting or bandwidth? I presume he&#39;s supposed to be happy because of the excellent
    service he receives from alnadeem? That could be used to justify using a little
    character dancing for almost every business in the world. I&#39;d drop the little
    man, he doesn&#39;t give anything to the logo. <BR> <BR>Whilst it&#39;s a little
    predictable, I like post #44. I think it&#39;s way stronger than anything else
    here. Firstly it&#39;s simple and abstract which feels like a telecommunications
    based company. Secondly, a wave is relevent to what alnadeem seem to do. <BR>
    <BR>Finally I would not drop the double language. By keeping arabic and latin
    alphabets united you imply an international identity which fits nicely into the
    idea of world commerce and breaking national boundaries that the web &#40;and
    one might presume, your customers&#41; aspire to. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s what I think

    Maybe it will help if you take this last icon and give the small squares radius
    edges like the larger one. While you&#39;re at it, increase the radius to match
    the arc in the Arabic writing&#39;s radius. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott
