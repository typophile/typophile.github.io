    or not it's a font\u2026although I tend to think not."

  body: "No match. But if you are mainly interested in the R, there is some hope.
    R looks sort of Sci-Fi or techno -- you could go through IconianFonts or the Sci-Fi
    /Techno themes at Dafont & see if there is anything close enough for you to like
    -- or comic book, which you could check through at Blambot.\r\nDon\r\n"
