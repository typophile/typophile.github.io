  body: The &#34;a&#34; and &#34;b&#34; letters could suggest some cups of coffee.
    what do you think? Work harder on the &#34;F&#34; letter... it doesn&#39;t say
    too much. <BR> <BR>Kobe.

  body: Kia Ora Ritesh. I guess this is for Tanya eh?  <BR>&#40;There is a definate
    spike of Wanganui  <BR>designer posting as of late!&#41; How about <BR>thinking
    about what food is ultra colourful, <BR>and subtley suggesting that within the
    glyphs <BR>of the word? I can see fruit in this, might be <BR>drops of fruit juice,
    or the suggestive umlaut <BR>above the a - like stylised leaves. I reckon <BR>the
    type is quite suitable. <BR> <BR>good luck!  <BR> <BR>kris

  body: Ritesh, it looks nice but I don&#39;t get any sense of idenity. It could just
    as easily be a logo for a wood working company. You need to hit the consummer
    over the head alittle bit. How about a tagline &#34;a swiss cafe&#34; or cafe
    imagery. Don&#39;t be so subtile.

  body: oki guys thanks for the comments... here is some quick changes i made.. 1
    thing which is annoying me is the &#34;F&#34; in the bottom line.. i&#39;m not
    sure about it.. also im not sure if the colour of the cheese is going with the
    logo... im also not sure if the cheese is recognised as the umlaut...do i have
    to have the cheese as yellow ? is the cheese becoming too dominant ? <BR> <BR>comments
    plz <BR>thanks <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35245.jpg"

  body: Yeah, it does that. I learned quickly that Typophile teaches you the Zen habit
    of expecting your post to go through <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I agree with Florian, the capital F in the main
    logo really isn&#39;t working for me. Try straightening the spine but keep that
    rounded upper-left corner. Also, the font you&#39;re using is very much a display
    face

  body: 'Ritesh, here is what happens with the posting. About half the time you will
    receive that error message. Ignore it and go back. Go up to topics and you will
    see your name listed as the last posted message. Have faith it works.  <BR> <BR>As
    for the logo what is your primary audience? Think is it McDonalds or is it Starbucks?
    If its McDonalds keep the yellow marks. If its Starbucks make the whole logo more
    upscale. Maybe even a metallic look like a latte machine. '

    of F and R.  <BR>As for being Swiss, consider black, red and white as colors.  <BR><img

  body: 'Does the last &#39;a&#39; have to be in red? Perhaps I&#39;m missing something.
    It seems to me that there are too many different things, visually, going on: different
    colors, some with outlines, counters filled with different colors. and the typeface
    used for &#34;swiss cafe and bar&#34; should be complimentary, but not the same,
    unless of course this typeface is part of a greater family with smallcaps or somesuch.'

  body: 'Ritesh, the Fa combination needs to be tightened I could drive a truck between
    them, the same could be said for the rb combination. I like the new colors alot.
    I personally don&#39;t love floating type, I  would tend to make the tagline a
    little larger &#40;not alot&#41; and tighten up the spacing. '

  body: I think the name is interesting enough. I used the shortened version of University
    from German and made it ooni for a project.  <BR> <BR>The issue comes with the
    umlaut at the end. Though I am not from Germany I do speak the language and it
    looks like a improper use for no purpose at all. You say it would say phontically
    &#34;farbay&#34; Even using the umlaut on the last a it would never phonetically
    say &#39;ay&#39;. <BR> <BR>It like the issue that people have with Haagen Dazs.
    Sort of evocative, completely incorrect in grammatic acknowledgement and cultural
    relvevance&#40;the dutch use double vowel &#39;aa&#39; and such but the Germans
    do not&#41;, but is a fairly strong brand once you get past the semantics. <BR>
    <BR>In english and in german it would be &#39;far-bah&#39;. I think the name is
    unique enough that it can use the original and implied pronounciaton better than
    just &#39;jazzin&#39; it up. <BR> <BR>As for the colors I would find two colors
    that share similar hues.  Brown and darkening yellow. Orange and brown. Or go
    in a completely opposite direction if you so choose. It has got be true to form
    or a polar opposite. Depending on how you are interpreting the mood, location,
    price and products offered, etc.
