  following:\r\n\r\nI am currently designing a small poetry book containing all my
  strange junk mail (example below). As I receive this via e-mail I would like the
  face to somehow reflect that, but I would like this book set out in a classic poetry
  book style. I would prefer to use a serif font, any advice or comments on this would
  be great.\r\n\r\nSo far I have stuck to my usual faces such as Garamond, Minion,
  Bembo etc... all of which do not carry the 'technological' aspect....? I'm stuck!\r\n\r\nExample

    that Electra is particulary suitable to poetry... however I am drawn to Kepler
    and Minion as they are cut by Robert Slimbach who cut my favourite version of
    Garamond (Adobe)... oh!\r\n\r\nthanks, any help would be great.\r\nClaire"

  body: "Kepler is a beautiful typeface and very underused. Understated too. Could
    be very nice for poetry. \r\n\r\nElectra is a gorgeous little typeface and Dwiggins
    holds a special place in my heart. But, it is overused. This isn't to say you
    shouldn't use it, but that it has been done and it might be a more worthy challenge
    to use Kepler. Especially if you have the optical version. Do you?"

    body: "I'm not sure which version I have to be honest... It has around 130 different
      versions... I have laid all faces out VERY roughly so I don't want to shock
      you with their lack of leading etc at the moment... but Kepler and Electra are
      the winners (minion is doing well, however chaparral looks awful, too heavy).
      I may try a few more tests, see how far I can push them... Ill keep you posted.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    body: "i regards to\r\n'I think SPAM poetry needs to be in a screen font. A bitmap
      font.'\r\n\r\nI see what you mean, but this book is to be presented as a regular
      poetry book until you look closer at the actual poems...\r\n\r\nI think using
      a bitmap font would detract from the words of the poetry... thanks tho!"

    guessing you don't want to use Courier, but perhaps there is something else suitible?
    (<a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-15-etelka\">Etelka</a>
