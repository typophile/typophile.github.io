  font. My typeface is going to be design in a 2x6 grid. So it would be align vertically
  and horizontal.\r\n\r\nI want to see what you guys think about it, also if you have
  any resources or if you know any information on grid fonts.\r\n\r\nThe person that
  actually got me into this whole grid base was Wim Crouwel, got his book as a ref.\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance.\r\n"

    you can research some pixel or computer related fonts for solutions, such as:

    forward to seeing the final result."

  body: "Ive finished the lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. As I see it laid
    out I may have to consider just having descenders on the lowercase because the
    \u201Cg\u201D and the \u201Cq\u201D seem small compare to the rest of the letters.\r\n\r\nI
    love how the numbers came out. Im very happy with it. As for the symbols\u2026well
    im ok with it, they are as what they are.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uppercase_6014.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lowercase_6447.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numbers_6232.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/symbols_6605.png]"

  body: I know the angle letters in the uppercase are thin, im still working on that.
    Will update soon. I thinking that I might bring the descenders in the lowercase,
    I don't know what do you think?

    the way, i read q as g."

  body: "I would recommend that you never show or look at this as an alphabet, but
    only in real words.\r\nThat way, you will be disinclined to create glyphs which
    look nice on their own, but don't work in words, either through poor legibility
    or bad colour."

  body: "Ok so that's 2x6 grid I have to do another grid out of the eight below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p1060948_4020.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    just need you to pick TWO letters from the alphabet so I can test the range of
    these grids and with the result expand on another grid.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n@riccard0:
    I guess I should include descenders in my typeface.\r\n\r\n@Nick: Ok, Im just
    apply these forms into words, to see how they look and translate visually, but
    after I do some changes.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBesides
    making a type face i have to do a folder containing all the progress throughout
    the semester. I want to make a zine that in which one side is all the info and
    in the back is the finish product. Im doing two versions one for each of the grids(2).\r\n\r\nSomething
    like this, which I love!!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.esquire.co.uk/2010/02/launching-the-esquire-zine/\r\n\r\nIm
    still thinking on what kind of paper to use, something light with a bit of tooth
    to it...newsprint I think, but I believe that's to light and you might see through
    to the other side.\r\n"
