body: "Hi there, I would like some opinions on the right relationship (distance) bewteen
  ascenders and descenders in a paragraph. Here is a sample of a paragraph from a
  book text setting. Since I find a tighter leading more readable - and more pleasing
  -, I'm a bit perplexed by the close distance of ascenders and descenders in some
  specific places (see the second image). I wonder if this kind of setting will cause
  troubles in the reading process.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions and critique.\r\n\r\nhttp://farm8.staticflickr.com/7037/6943346281_23d7a987f4_o.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://farm8.staticflickr.com/7198/6797230554_e1e4c4fd57_o.jpg"

  body: Yikes, those are some close calls! It feels like I am driving on a very narrow
    multi-lane road, and my side view mirrors are about to hit oncoming traffic. Tighter
    leading is one thing, but I think you have gone too far for this typeface. Could
    you find something with a larger x-height and shorter a/descenders?

    too tight overall\r\nfor that line measure (probably because the\r\nx-height is
    so modest).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Right.\r\n\r\nThe oldstyle had been set without extra leading, then when
    the neoclassical style came along in the late 18th century, extra leading was
    part of the look\u2014hence different specs for Garamond and Baskerville.\r\n\r\nThere
    is also the matter of line length, which has a bearing on rivers and the regularity
    of word space size, against which the effect of extender-proximity \u201Cislands\u201D
    has a relationship.\r\n\r\nAnd times moves on, so one individual may get bored
    with a certain kind of setting \u2014 and it might also go out of fashion.\r\n\r\nAll
    of these considerations may have affected the change of specs between the two
    publications of Morison\u2019s tract."

  body: "I can't see a change of logic or taste between those\r\ntwo samples. The
    differences of line-length, x-height\r\nand point size are plenty reason to have
    a much larger\r\ngap in the second setting.\r\n\r\nIn fact if anything I would
    expect the 30s to be\r\nmuch more generous with leading than the 60s.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think that Morison's first try was better, so I suppose I would advise
    the OP not to worry about the \"close calls\". Not that an extra 1/4 point of
    leading would hurt anything, but in general, longer ascenders and descenders are
    to be preferred over more leading for the same x-height and the same linespacing.\r\n\r\nBecause
    the ascenders and descenders contain information, hence more of the printed page
    is actually doing work presenting the text to the eye.\r\n\r\nIn practice, of
    course, typefaces have for some time tended to have small ascenders and descenders,
    so that one can get a larger x-height for the same text density (assuming no change
    in how condensed the face is, reduce the linespacing by 5% and increase the x-height
    by 5%, and you have the same amount of text on the page).\r\n\r\nAnd it's definitely
    true that x-height does an even better job of conveying information to the reader
    than ascenders and descenders, even if they do something and the leading does
    nothing.\r\n\r\nSo using a typeface like Corona with generous leading is the worst
    case; using a typeface like Cloister Light set tightly is better; but the best
    case - from the standpoint of efficiency, <em>not</em> aesthetics - is using a
    <em>larger point size</em> of a typeface like Corona, also set tightly.\r\n\r\nThe
    ascenders and descenders should be just long enough so that, even when the face
    is used without leading, the eye can easily follow the line without confusion.
    So that may mean a bit more than the newspaper faces offer."
