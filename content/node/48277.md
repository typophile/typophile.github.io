body: "I've been working on a script font with tons of contextual code including calt
  and clig features as well as several SS features. It has CE language support so
  I finally decided to do the class based kerning for all of that. I had the classes
  widows only showing kern classes while I was working to make it easier to handle.
  In order to preview my kerning in the OT preview I selected generate kern feature.
  When I compiled it said \"fatal error\" and listed the first instance of a OT class.
  I went back to the classes panel to find out FL had deleted all my OT classes. \r\nIs
  there a way to recover my OT classes? Did this happen from selecting the kern classes
  at the bottom of the panel (on Mac version) or is this some particular bug in the
  system?\r\n\r\nAny help greatly appreciated.\r\nStephen "

  body: "Thanks Nick,\r\nI've added so many glyphs its probably just as well to redo
    the classes. I went through the feature code and made a list of my OT classes
    by name. Since I didn't have fractions and such, I only needed 6 OT classes, so
    I think if I have a bit of patience I can reconstruct them reasonably quick. I
    will make note of that bug. \r\n"

    upgraded to Leopard and was able to use Time Machine to retrieve an earlier version
    of the FontLab file before the feature code was deleted by the bug.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a thread where the bug is discussed:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/41744\r\n"

    and clig and added them back in manually. Recompiled and all is good again. I
    will remember not to mess with that again. In my case it was hitting generate
    kern feature while only kern was showing that caused the drop of OT features.\r\n\r\nLesson
    learned."
