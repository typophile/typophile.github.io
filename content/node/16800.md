  science and my wife's constant urging. I will be getting a Colonoscopy! \r\nIn an
  attempt to lighten up the Lunar landing and get a chuckle from the doctors and nurses
  (who will have the unearthly thrill of injecting large plumbing objects where the
  Sun don't shine on my \"best side\"), I am taping a sign on my lunar landing site.
  Since I have never made one of those posts so often seen here on Typophile \"What
  is the best font for...?\", I thought now was the time to ask:\r\nWhat is the best
  font for \"Lunar Landing Site\"?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lunar
