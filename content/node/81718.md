  body: "Great interview, props to Paul Shaw.\r\nHow refreshing to have questions
    asked about details of the new type as it compares to other faces, instead of
    the usual \"I just discovered fonts let me give you a brief history and Gotham
    was Obama's campaign face\" that passes for journalism.\r\n\r\n<em>Thus, Carter
    is unique in having designed type in every medium that has existed since the era
    of Gutenberg: metal, wood, film and digital.</em>\r\n\r\nI did wonder about that.\r\nSurely
    there are others who have designed for all four media?"

    is rubdown transfer type, e.g. Letraset, so seldom remembered as one of the type
    media that have existed since the era of Gutenberg?"

  body: It's too bad they ran the images in the wrong proportions (more vertical than
    they should be). This is the same article that appeared a couple of months ago
    on the <a href="http://imprint.printmag.com/type/an-interview-with-matthew-carter/">Imprint</a>
    section of <i>Print</i>'s website, where you can see the images in the correct
    proportions.

  body: "How dry transfer lettering is manufactured (serigraphy) is not the printing
    medium.\r\nThe typography was done by rubbing onto paper.\r\nSure, it was then
    photographed for film assembly, but that wasn't typography either, and type imaged
    by any medium (e.g. letterpress) was also photographed for film assembly.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
    it could be argued that a slightly earlier method (1930s) of typesetting is also
    a unique category\u2014I refer to the assembly of letters pre-printed on transparent
    adhesive film. This product was still available in the 1980s, but I forget its
    name. One used a scalpel blade to cut a single \"b\" (for instance) from a group
    of b's on their backing sheet, peel it off, and position it on the knock-out blue
    baseline one had drawn on the artboard."

  body: "Mark, the article actually features the original images, with correct proportions
    (even hotlinked from imprint.printmag.com).  It is just that Salon.com\u2019s
    CSS stupidly forces them into a too narrow column. As they have a fixed height
    assigned, the browser has no choice but to squeeze them horizontally."

  body: "I figured that was probably the reason.\r\n\r\nNick, it was called Formatt.
    I still have some catalogs. I liked Formatt because they carried hard-to-find
    typefaces.\r\n\r\nThere was also a typesetting system called Fototype that you
    set like metal type, but was printed on paperboard. I've got some of it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fototype_3836.jpg]"
