  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Okay: I admit right upfront that I am a curmudgeon. I can see no point whatsoever in anxiously anticipating a whiff of Ashton Kutcher's latest brain-fart on Twitter. I just don't get it. I do the crossword puzzle in <em>The Washington Post</em> every day. With a pencil. And no Google. Thank God, the Post finally realized that its crossword puzzlers were presbyopic geezers like me, and increased the size of the puzzles and the clues. Hey, you kids! Get off that roof!

Anyhow, the world isn't going to respect my wishes not to be sucked into the milieu of up-to-the-minute. Social Media are here to stay, so I guess I have to get with the program or eventually disappear. How many other foundry/people are using Social Media as part of their overall marketing effort? How important is it to the overall effort? How much time to have to devote to it on a daily basis? And what in the world do you say on a regular basis in 140 characters or less that either has any relevance to what you do, or interests anyone who chooses to follow your tweets?

Inquiring minds want to know. Well, okay: one cranky old fart is curious…</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you're curious about Twitter just try it. It doesn't usually bite, and if you end up hating it more than you find it useful you can just leave again. The thing is, it is its own form of communication, which is hard to describe outside of experiencing it oneself. It takes some time to figure out good signal-to-noise strategies, dos and don'ts, as well as whom to follow, but I for one find it very useful for quickly getting ideas of who's up to what, etc. And yes, many type people are on Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gabrowitsch/type-designers/members">Here for instance is Ivo Gabrowitsch's list of type designers on Twitter (231 and counting).</a></div>

Are you familiar with RSS feeds? I think of twitter as a short-form RSS feed. 
It's a convenient tool to receive short interesting updates and news all in one place, instead of visiting a whole bunch of blogs and sites. 

What to tweet about? As a designer, I'd say most type/design-related stuff (even brain-farts) can be interesting to me.

For example: One of your posts in another thread would have been a tweet I found interesting/useful:

"One of the most comprehensive collections of information on PDF-related software…— http://www.planetpdf.com/"</div>

I am about your age and even live inside the Beltway, but I do use Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin.  So far, it has not cost me a cent so there is nothing to lose but your anonymity.  As far as "which is better"?  it does not matter, they are a tangled web that encompasses a huge and growing segment of society.  There are probably fewer of us geezers out there in Social Media Land than the younger portion of society but even grandparents who like to see messages and images from younger family members are joining the club.

"Oddly enough, the factory was spared destruction until the very end of the war. During an Allied daylight air raid, as late as April 1945, it was wiped out by over a thousand heavy bombs, whose explosive power was based on Alfred Nobel's own inventions. A bronze bust of Alfred Nobel which was found among the ruins, damaged by bullets but nonetheless upright, was set up in the administration building. During the 1950s, the site was cleared of ruins and used for building the nuclear power plant of Krümmel."

OT: Twitter is a nice way to get info re your interests (eg type) and the latest news. As far as the people you follow are ‘responsible’ (if not you chuck them). FaceBook is awful, meant for selfcentered teens and idiots.

		<div class="commentbody">Twitter is, in general, even less private than facebook, as unless you restrict, anyone can "follow" you. You can take steps to wall yourself off in either, but that kind of defeats the concept. I think most adults, at any rate, are pretty circumspect about what they share publicly. But there is a trade-off in less privacy for more contacts. But yes, some people have a distaste for less privacy and others—apparently a lot of others—don't mind.  </div>
