body: "One of the theses I have put forward in various contexts on Typophile over
  the years is that every mature scribal culture produces both formal (literary, static)
  and informal (chancery, cursive) styles. So I was delighted to discover this illustration
  in Gy\xF6rgy Kara\u2019s <em>Books of the Mongolian nomads.</em> Most reproductions
  of Mongolian script focus on the formal literary hands found in religious manuscripts,
  and although I have seen examples of cursive brush style, this is the first specimen
  of a chancery quill style that I have seen. Isn't it splendid!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mongcurs_6700.jpg]"

    that perfectly, right? Right?\r\n\r\nWho am I kidding?"

    I don\u2019t know about the challenges of vertical right to left setting, though."

    on its side. (given a word processor that can rotate the letters 90\xB0 and the
    textblock likewise)"

  body: Yes, directionality for Mongolian is fairly simple, and Mongolian fonts are
    typically made to work horizontally and the text block rotated by the software.

  body: "That really is stunning, reminds me of really intense european scripts from
    the middle ages, and hieriatic script from the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nVery intriguing
    theory too, have you considered that the mutation of script may coincide with
    the periodic shifts in pronunciation that it's verbal companion takes?"

    IMO.

  body: "The connection between Mongolian/Manchu writing and Aramaic, via Sogdian
    and Uighur, is well established. But the Uighurs (a Turkic people of Western China)
    were the first to rotate the Sogdian script and <a href=\"http://the_uighurs.tripod.com/images/scan.jpg\">write/read
    it vertically</a>, presumably in imitation of Chinese writing (but read columns
    left-to-write).* The Mongolians adopted and adapted the old Uighur script. There
    is some scant evidence of Mongolian being written in other Chinese-style scripts,
    such as Kitan, also vertically, prior to the adoption of the Uighur script.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Later,
    after their conversion to Islam, the Uighurs adopted the nastaliq style of Perso-Arabic
    script, so their old script now survives primarily in the Mongolian context."

  body: John, if you haven't you might want to consider checking out some of the many
    varieties of Tibetan script. In addition to a "colloquial" cursive pen script,
    there are a number of other cursive styles used for commentaries and exegesis
    on Tibetan religious texts. On this page, the third of the three writing styles
    is one of several less formal cursive forms. http://nalandatranslation.org/offerings/the-vidyadharas-poetry/

    was derived from the Tibetan script. This was around the time of Kublai Khan,
    so it was very long ago.\r\n\r\nAh, here we are. It was called Phags-Pa.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/phagspa.htm]]\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Phags-pa_script]]\r\n\r\n[[http://babelstone.co.uk/Blog/2006/12/phags-pa-fonts-3-babelstone-phags-pa.html]]"

  body: "My slip of the tongue: I wanted to write Phoenician, not Aramaic.\r\nTibetan
    script wasn't so handy like the abjad, which also made the Uighurs' conversion
    to Arabic so easy, because of similarity of the scripts.\r\nProbably some minorities
    (or their monks rather) still use the script in China? "
