  my tumblr <a href=\"http://epictype.tumblr.com/\">Epic Type</a>. This is personal
  training for lettering, type drawing and  typographic composition, that is why I
  need your feedback. I use Inkscape to make this compositions.\r\nAs you can understand,
  my goal is not to make font families but to create font specimens. Because I'm not
  ready yet to draw a entire typeface, I made this blog as a training place.\r\nPlease
  tell me what do you think about it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g4080_6093.png]"

  body: In all, not too bad. Your 'a' lower case is all over the place. And your 'd'
    and 'g' follow that route. Your 'o' and 'u' are not too bad, even thoug I would
    do some work on the 'u'.

    \r\n\r\nOne thing font software looks for that Inkscape does not are off-point
    extrema; are you making sure you don't have any? If you aren't, doing so may help
    you smooth out the a and u. Also, if you ever change your mind and decide to expand
    this into a full typeface, it would save you a lot of redrawing trouble."

  body: "\xABg\xBB \xABo\xBB and \xABul\xBB are not so bad, but \xABa\xBB is need
    really lot of changes. You need to draw better intersections between verticals
    strokes and curbes. You try to vectorial drawing reflect the letterforms that
    you thinked. With a little perseverance you can get to draw from a to z and go
    gradually improving the leterforms. Keep going."
