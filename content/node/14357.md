  thoughts turn to the future... in between TypeCon lovefests lies the (mostly) European
  typographic oasis that is ATypI.\r\n\r\nWho's going? When ya gettin' there? Who
  needs a roommate (several people I know are looking)? Who will sport the coolest
  typo tee? And, most importantly, will Yves show us some more spectacular dance moves?"
