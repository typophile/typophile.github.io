    Thin]] from Font Bureau. The short middle arm of the E is the hardest part to
    match and Agenda's is a bit shorter, at least. The G chin is the only other noteworthy
    detail in these letters, and it is relatively low. Unfortunately this G shape
    is probably the most common, so it's all about the amount of closure and the proportions
    of the chin relative to the rest of the letter. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
