body: Hi everyone <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on a logo for my new site, oakandelm.org
  .. The name doesn&#39;t have much meaning to it, I just thought it was cool.. So
  why not a cool logo with some meaning? I&#39;ve been messing around with different
  ways of interpreting a tree trunk. For my type, I chose &#39;Knockout&#39; because
  it resembles the kind of type I think of when I hear &#34; wood type &#34;  <BR>
  <BR>Any comments / suggestions would be greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR>-Drew <BR><img

  body: 'Drew, the concentric circles seem <BR>to be fighting for attention on all
    the versions <BR>except the first one. I like that one best. <BR> <BR>suggestions:
    <BR> <BR>&#42; maybe a less tall, condensed version of Knockout? <BR>&#42; play
    with the ampersand, both in weight and design. <BR>&#42; look at the structure
    of the two trees and see if you <BR>can somehow harmoniously tie them together.
    <BR>&#42; look at the leaves of the two trees and see if there&#39;s <BR>some
    distinction or connection. <BR>&#42; check out some more woodtype for inspiration,
    too. <BR>I think we had some good Woodtype links posted here, <BR>but I can&#39;t
    remember exactly where. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>  <BR>'

  body: I like the rings in the last log the best. Why don&#39;t you just hand draw
    the O &amp; E? The letter&#39;s should have some of the imperfections of the rings.

  body: I really like the core concept here. I agree with both bj and drew about searching
    out some alternative type specimens. I also second bj&#39;s motion to really examine
    the relationship between the Oak and Elm trees &#40;i.e. bark, leaves, etc.&#41;.
    Currently, it looks like you have one of the same issues I had a couple of months
    ago when I was designing my logo
