  called &#34;Voices of Lower Manhattan&#34; and should have pretty broad appeal for

  time nor budget to fully develop a logotype so I&#39;m posting the thing I&#39;ve

  body: well, obviously A looks better but the um ligature shows better the m than
    the u. Maybe you should work a little more on it to make the client happy. <BR>Anyway
    opcion c has a question for me, why you choose 2 of the 3 vocals to play? Man,
    just make the gag in 1 &#40;u, maybe with lu ligature&#41; or make it in the o
    too. 0, 1 or 3 but never 2. It is not much justified. Sorry about the bad english.

    They  <BR>want  the V, O, L and M to stand out -- as in SOHO  <BR>&#40;South of

  body: C isn&#39;t bad, given the acronym you&#39;re trying to emphasize. <BR> <BR>In
    my &#40;very&#41; humble opinion, the negative space of the e is a little cramped.  You
    might shorten the tail of the e to compensate, or else make the u a touch narrower
    to &#34;match&#34; it.  The latter has the additional advantage of making the
    L&#39;s base a little shorter. <BR> <BR>Keep in mind that logos are my specialty;
    typography is still somewhat new to me. <BR> <BR>Paul

    and M, doesn&#39;t work in option C, but it does in option B. And I think it would
    work better if you put an &#34;uc M&#34;, allthough you will loose the visual
    game you make in option A, but I think it would be worth it. Besides in option
    A, the &#34;M&#34; doesn&#39;t stand up at the level of VOL. <BR> <BR>I hope I
    expressed correctly. <BR> <BR>CG

    to follow the calligraphic way &#40;script&#41; for a better and fluid reading
    of the letters.

  body: Yeah, it&#39;s interesting. It&#39;s a basic gestalt issue. Because   <BR>two
    of six characters are treated differently, the two are   <BR>going to stand out
    more than the ones I&#39;m trying to   <BR>emphasize.  <BR>  <BR>I tried some
    of what you&#39;re &#40;Graham&#41; showing. By   <BR>introducing the bars under
    the u and e I was trying to   <BR>make the overall color more even.  I supposed
    it&#39;s a   <BR>toss-up as to which are more successful &#40;underlines vs.  <BR>color
    vs. weight change&#41;. All the approaches seem a   <BR>tad awkward. A good sign
    that the idea itself is flawed?  <BR>  <BR>Also, I&#39;m glad you see this as
    more of a fashion thing   <BR>than a non-profit thing. It&#39;s intentional. Volume
    isn&#39;t the   <BR>non-profit itself, that&#39;s just the name of the &#34;program&#34;   <BR>they&#39;re
    developing. It&#39;s aim is to promote and preserve   <BR>lower Manhattan lifestyle
    to the general public, not to   <BR>other organizations or businesses.  <BR>
