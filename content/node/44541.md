body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone could help me identify this font:\r\n\r\nIs
  this a custom logo?\r\n\r\nIf so, does anyone have any suggestions for an equally
  playful cursive / tubular font that has a little elegance to it? Something that
  would be good for typing out french phrases....\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\nDavid"
