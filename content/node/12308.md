body: So, you thought <a href="http://www.houseind.com">House Industries</a> (ahem,
  <em>Mister</em> House Industries) was all grown up, having added the Neutraface
  and Benguiat families in recent years. Well, they just upped the ante with <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=171&subpage=viewfonts">Paperback</a>,
  a serious text face with optically sized masters, patterns, alternate figures, dingbats,
  et cetera. Everything you'd want if  you're designing for, well a paperback, or
  maybe for newsprint.

  body: A fact that I totally missed is that [[John Downer]] designed it. Fitting
    that they're promoting it with his <a href="http://www.houseind.com/include/getimage.php?id=1521">bare
    chested likeness</a>. Hilarious. Bravo House!

  body: "Yes. I saw the ad in the latest HOW and laughed out loud. Although, seeing
    him--John Downer--in the flesh and posing a some sort of type designing Fabio
    was not a surprise, as he always finds an excuse, or reason, to show off his water-polo-exercised
    body to the masses. ::wink:: ::grin::\r\n\r\nThat said, I'd like to add that <a
    href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=171&subpage=viewfontspecimens\">Paperback</a>
    looks amazing and the italic is gorgeous."
