  case [[fractions]] (I believe that's what they're called) for a cookbook? Thank
  you!

  body: any good, recent Opentype font family should include case fractions, and software
    should let you access them easily.

  body: "It kind of depends on just which fractions you need. Recent Adobe fonts have
    \"arbitrary\" fractions, so if you're using a layout program that can use OpenType
    features, you can set about anything, including such oddities as 127/653.\r\n\r\nThere
    is long debate over just what to call these critters. \"Case fractions\" or \"piece
    fractions\" are two of the most common terms. To me, \"arbitrary fractions\" most
    closely resembles the historical \"piece fraction,\" but you could argue that,
    too.\r\n\r\nFrom Adobe, Arno comes to mind. Makes me hungry for more . . .\r\n\r\n"

  body: I will be using, at the most, fractions up until 1/8. I'm just getting used
    to the whole OpenType thing and what it can do for me. I use INDD 3 for my layouts.
    The way I usually access characters like fractions is to open my glyphs palette
    and "tap-tap". I've never chosen a font for it's fractions so this help is very
    much appreciated!

    if you like that sort of thing (as well as \"slash\" fractions).\r\n\r\nThey also
    have the OpenType \"fraction\" feature coded so that \"number-space-number-slash-number\"
    sets as \"number-hairspace-fraction\", so that all you have to do is apply \"fraction\"
    to the style sheet globally, and the original text manuscript sets every number
    and fraction correctly.\r\n\r\nI've put that feature in all my recent releases,
    Duffy, Beaufort Pro, Pratt Pro, and the upcoming FF Oneleigh Pro."

  body: "<cite> > The brilliant \u201Cspace to space.thin\u201D idea is taken from
    Tal </cite>\r\n\r\nI'll take some credit for that. I went to Tal with that issue,
    because of my work with cookbooks and building books. The promise of OpenType
    and Unicode was that the underlying semantic information would be retained when
    crossing presentational thresholds, and yet integer-fraction combinations would
    break down moving from Editorial (where there was a space to distinguish 1 1/2
    from 11/2) to Design where space between integer and proper stacked fractions
    is routinely removed. Backing text out of Design files for other editions or re-purposing
    would require careful proofing to find these integer-fraction cases.\r\n\r\nI
    didn't realize that Karsten had come up with an algorithm to remove dates from
    being caught up by the substitution. That was one of the only situations where
    I foresaw a breakdown in this global approach. (That and specialized conventions
    like roof pitches, where 9/12 is not a fraction.) But Tal and I figured that manually
    unstyling a date exception would be less onerous than all the fraction styling
    in many situations. \r\n\r\nI remember some threads about fraction codes, but
    I don't often keep tabs on the Build forum, so I must have missed some.\r\n\r\nGlad
    to see you're implementing this approach. I've convinced FB to put it into Whitman
    OT (when we get around to building that out), and I think they're going to adopt
    it as a standard implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "Kent, It looks OK except for those of us who have a history of doing fractions
    a certain way. For example, we \"preprocess,\" or \"precode\" text files, changing
    them to \"InDesign Tagged Text\" files before bringing them into InDesign. The
    instruction to use the fraction \"feature\" is coded there. And any space following
    the full numeral removed; there is a class kern between any number and any numerator.\r\n\r\nNot
    saying this is better, since most people don't preprocess their text files (but
    thereby lose a lot of possibilities).\r\n\r\nBTW, we use to have a lot of such
    features with the old PostScript fonts, using TeX & macros. We always made up
    a \"superiors\" font, alpha/numerics, with everything on the baseline. We wrote
    a \"nut fraction\" macro; as you can imagine, we had, essentially, \"arbitrary\"
    nut fractions. A slight modification gave us musical time (stacked numbers w/o
    the bar). Arbitrary slashed fractions were a piece of cake.\r\n\r\nI suppose most
    of this could be implemented in OpenType, except how to draw the variable length
    bar with arbitrary nut fractions?\r\n\r\nBTW2, Matthew Carter frequently has nut
    fractions available for his fonts, but sometimes you have to get up with Cherie
    Cone & buy them. Always Type 1, to date. I believe I have them for Miller, and
    as mentioned above, Monticello."

  body: "<em>...how to draw the variable length bar with arbitrary nut fractions?</em>\r\n\r\nI
    believe the best way, in OpenType, would be to include it with the numerator.\r\nSo
    the numerator is always centred over the bar without getting into zero widths
    and overlapping negative kerns, which I found to be not consistently interpreted
    in Adobe apps.\r\nBut it would entail a lot of glyphs and coding, so I haven't
    done it yet.\r\n\r\nBut really, why bother, unless doing a math font, which is
    something else again."

    all learn fractions in math at school and render them in \"nut\" format with a
    horizontal bar, yet in recent years expediency (sloppiness under the guise of
    legibility) has obselesced presenting them that way in type."

  body: "Charles, if I understand your preprocessing correctly, that's not going to
    create a problem with the fraction approach that Tal, Nick, and I am advocating.
    The thing about this approach is that it still performs as expected in a workflow
    that is accommodated to an Adobe-style arbitrary fraction feature -- that is to
    say, a case-by-case fraction-specific application.\r\n\r\nSo if you preprocess
    by removing the space after the integer, presumably you're only enclosing the
    fraction itself with the &lt;cotff:&gt; tags. This is not a problem, and the fraction
    will be properly styled with the appropriate numerator-fraction-denominator substitution.
    The preceding space is not required to trigger the substitution. \r\n\r\nOr did
    I misunderstand your reservation?\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

    with an {afrc} alternate fraction feature, but I don't think that is supported
    in any software yet. \r\n\r\nIt would not be able to easily handle a double digit
    fraction like Charles's example of 11/16, except by some careful manual manipulation,
    like setting 1/1 next to 1/6 and kerning them until the fraction bar touches.
    Not elegant. And it wouldn't be of any use in a single-over-double situation.\r\n\r\nIIRC
    Roy Preston was attempting to come up with an elegant solution for arbitrary stacked
    fractions in his Preferent fonts. This was before OpenType, and I don't know what
