  here is the cover of Dalton Trumbo's 1939 edition of \"Johnny Got His Gun\" for

  body: That's interesting... The type on this 1939 hardcover matches that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Got_His_Gun">the
    jacket that went over it</a>. I wonder if that was common practice back then.
