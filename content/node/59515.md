  We used Clarendon to visualize the dynamics of a Merce Cunningham dance, importing
  the 3d motion-capture, and linking it to written descriptions of the work.\r\n\r\nhttp://vimeo.com/4757586
  \r\n\r\nAscenders & Descenders is a typographic reinterpretation of Merce Cunningham's
  dancing hands as recorded by OpenEnded Group for the Loops project. The piece cannot
  exist without the feeble words that huff and puff to make sense of Merce's work.
  It is, in a sense, a Cunningham dance work reconstructed from textual deconstructions
  of other Cunningham dance works. Each finger has an associated excerpt from an article,
  review, or essay on Cunningham from the last five decades. These texts become the
  ink with which each finger manifests its movements. Each text is dynamically typeset
  in three dimensional space along the curves traced by his fingertips.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/event515e_3576.jpg]"
