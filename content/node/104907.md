  tentative economic recovery has had a new shot in the arm with figures showing the
  number of profit warnings from UK companies has fallen to its lowest level since
  2011.\r\n\r\nThe figures come ahead of official economic numbers this week expected
  to show a sharp upturn in growth.\r\nIn the three months to the end of June figures
  from EY \u2013 formerly known as Ernst & Young \u2013 show the number of stock-market
  quoted companies warning that profits would not meet previous expectations fell
  to 54. This was six fewer than the same time last year and 18 down on the same period
  in 2011.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of the year there were 72 profit warnings.
  The 25 per cent fall in the second quarter was the biggest drop since 2011.\r\n\r\n\u2018The
  UK recovery certainly appears more entrenched and better placed to ride out the
  aftershocks that have triggered sobering second-half dips in economic activity in
  recent years,\u2019 said Keith McGregor, EY\u2019s head of restructuring for Europe,
  the Middle East and Africa.\r\n\r\n  \u2018That said, the economy still faces significant
  domestic challenges, especially from inflation. A stagnant eurozone and cooling
  emerging markets also look likely to place a speed limit on growth.\u2019\r\nAmong
  the sectors with the highest number of profit warnings were software and computer
  services, travel and leisure, and media, each with five profit warnings.\r\n\r\nIn
  contrast, leading retailers issued just two warnings in the second quarter compared
  with five in the same time last year. EY notes that clothing companies were worst
  hit, with about a third of profit warnings from retailers coming from such firms
  in the past year.\r\n\r\n\u2018Struggling retailers appear to share operating characteristics,
  rather than products. These include excess physical space, weak brands, low differentiation
  as well as the inability to compete with increasingly aggressive competitors on
  product and price,\u2019 said Alan Hudson, EY\u2019s head of restructuring for the
  UK and Ireland.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on Thursday economic output figures for the second
  quarter of the year will be issued. GDP growth is expected to have doubled from
  0.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent in the period, reckons economic forecasters IHS Global
  Insight. \r\nIHS now believes GDP will grow by 1.1 per cent this year and 1.8 per
  cent in 2014.\r\n\r\n\u2018The fact that the recent improvement has occurred across
  a wide range of sectors is particularly encouraging and reinforces hopes that the
  UK economy really is moving to a firmer footing,\u2019 said IHS.\r\n\r\nVisit our
