  body: "I agree with DesignGuy as far as looking like a Sudtipos/Ale Paul font, although
    I would have picked some of the following as being more similar: [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000181|Affair]],
    [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000213|Buffet Script]],
    [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000149|Ministry Script]]
    and [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000105|La Portenia]].
    All of these had a very similar feeling, but details weren't the same. I wonder
    if this used alternates from one of the fonts I mentioned. At least the test drives
    chose different letterforms.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
