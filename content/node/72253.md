  typeface in which it is set.  Unfortunately there is no information about the type.\r\n\r\nA
  picture can be found here: http://twitpic.com/24xmye\r\n\r\nThe book was published
  in 1949.  More information to come, if needed (like the title, which would be helpful,
  I know, but I cannot remember it...)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n"
