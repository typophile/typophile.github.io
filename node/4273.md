  &#34;D&#34;. &#40;I submitted it to ITC, but it was rejected.&#41; <BR>I&#39;m very
  happy with the basic concept. I&#39;ve never seen a font where the stroke essentially
  weaves in and out like this. Hopefully you can see the hand behind this work. It
  was not produced with a digital filter. <BR>I&#39;d be interested in any opinions.
  <BR>Many thanks.'

    a number of weight and &#34;jitteriness&#34; variants. <BR> <BR>As for the name,
    I think maybe it&#39;s a bit too plain/descriptive. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' This is a cool effect, and the characters are suprisingly legible at all
    sizes. <BR> <BR>At risk of offending potential marketers of my own fonts, don&#39;t
    feel too badly about the fact that ITC rejected yours. I find many &#40;not all&#41;
    of ITC&#39;s fonts to be overly sterilized anyway. &#40;As evidence, witness what
    they did to the Storm Typefoundry&#39;s beautiful Biblon typeface, or ITC &#34;Garamond&#34;.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I suspect you&#39;d do well with this font on MyFonts.com. <BR> <BR>I
    look forward to seeing more of the character set, including lower case characters.

  body: 'Thankyou both for your comments. <BR>Here is a &#34;light&#34; version of
    Fear: <BR><A HREF="http://www.dazeofourlives.com/fearlite.gif" TARGET="_top">http://www.dazeofourlives.com/fearlite.gif</A>
    <BR>which WAS produced using a filter. &#40;The Offset Path filter in Illustrator.&#41;
    It&#39;s just for comparison really. The &#34;levels of jitteriness&#34; idea
    is very interesting. <BR> <BR>Re: ITC. I totally agree about their generally bland
    type collection. But they and they alone still pay the designer an upfront royalty
    for each font they publish. No other font publisher does this.  <BR>Personally
    - and this is probably not the right forum to discuss this - I have no idea how
    anyone except the elite type designers make any money from their craft. Every
    font is so labor intensive that it just doesn&#39;t make economic sense to pursue
    type design as anything more than a hobby.  <BR>So for me - if I&#39;m not going
    to get a $2500 check from ITC in advance of sales - then why bother devoting hundreds
    of hours for the paltry sums I might get through other outlets? It works out to
    what - a dollar an hour? I cannot justify spending time on type design when I
    have bills to pay, etc. <BR>Anyhow - sorry for the negative rant.'

    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s $2000 for exclusive ownership transferred  <BR>to BT. They seem
    to accept just about anything,  <BR>judging by the quality of their recent releases.

    <BR> <BR> <BR>Typographically, I have great fun playing with 19th century types
    for designs used in Daze of Our Lives material. I really think it was such a rich,
    inventive and eclectic time for type design. The modern age and minimalism definitely
    killed a lot of that spirit off. <BR>Again, thanks - and spread the good word
    about Daze for me would you?'
