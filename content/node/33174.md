  font - every PC format I generate out of my either my fotlab or fontographer file
  the kerning is lost. the kerning works fine for this same font if it generated as
  a MAC format. i have tried generating an open type, true type and type 1 version
  for the PC and the kerning will just not work. any thoughts on what might be the
  casue? thanks!"

  body: What do you mean the kerning is lost? If you are generating  PFB files, also
    generate an .AFM file. You can open that with almost any text editor, and I'll
    bet the KPX commands are there. If you are using only InDesign as your applications
    program, there is a bug in InDesign that has been covered many, many times on
    this forum. For OpenType fonts, make sure you have at least one character substitution
    feature so that a GSUB table is built, build your kerning tables, compile the
    features, and generate an OpenType font. If there is no GSUB table, kerning won't
    work in ID through version CS2. They say that is fixed with CS3.

  body: "OK, for Type 1 fonts for the PC, remember that most PC programs don't use
    the .AFM file, they use a .PFM file -- it is just that you can simply open an
    .AFM file in a text editor & see what is there. But I can't imagine that either
    FontLab or Fontographer would generate a .AFM & not a .PFM, as long as you have
    the right \"boxes\" checked off. Of course, I've been know to have limited imagination
    . . .\r\n"

  body: In what applications program -- include year and version number -- running
    on which PC Operating system? For example, some of the old Word formats running
    on Windows 98 didn't support kerning. And actually, we've just ended my expertise,
    it is time for someone with more knowledge to step in.

      any one program that is the probelm it seems to be the generated font it's self.
      any true type format i generate either Mac or PC does not display the kerning
      when used in any program. this goes for both my MAC and PC machines. any Postscript
      type 1 format i generate works fine.\r\n\r\nany thoughts out there? i am at
      a loss."
