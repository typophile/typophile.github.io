body: 'Can I get some opinions about something I&#39;ve been thinking about for awhile?...
  <BR> <BR>A typeface optimally tuned for foreign-language dictionaries; here are
  some of the primary concerns that I can see: <BR> <BR>1&#41;  Length of reading
  time.  This depends on the kind of reading &#40;definitely not long-term literature
  reading, but 2 or 3 pages of speed reading, or &#34;speed-glancing&#34;, in order
  to find the desired item, which leads us into #2&#41;. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  Vertical,
  rather than horizontal, reading.  This poses the biggest question to me...  the
  vertical motion is similar to that which we experience while browsing a scrolling
  website &#40;which, of course, uses a sanserif--could any respectable work on paper
  use sanserif and be taken seriously?&#41;   <BR> <BR>I believe typefaces with heavy
  or bulky serifs make a dictionary&#39;s usability difficult &#40;it&#39;s an industry
  concerned way more with content than practical aesthetics&#41;.  I wonder, what
  about a face with soft serifs &#40;that is, something less obtrusive than, say,
  the in-your-face serifs of an &#34;s&#34; in Times Roman&#41;, something somewhere
  just on the edge of having no serifs at all...'

  body: Lexicon--looks like a nice face; to be honest I was unaware of its existence
    until you pointed it out, so thanks Victor.  But the post wasn&#39;t a riddle,
    I can see the cryptic tone after looking at it now.  What I really want is some
    opinion on what might work best &#40;or better than that used currently&#41; in
    dictionaries, especially foreign-language dictionaries, and specifically dictionaries
    covering indigenous languages of the Americas. <BR> <BR>Having worked directly
    in the field of lexicography for the past 3 or 4 years &#40;and still going--much
    to the dismay of my eyes!&#41;, I&#39;ve noticed the distinct tendency on the
    part of publishers to give a dictionary&#39;s typeface very little thought at
    all.  I believe the criteria at present is the same as any other work of literature--and
    this just isn&#39;t right. <BR> <BR>Just wanted to pool the &#34;in-the-know&#34;
    expertise of typophiles.  And of course, theoretical arguments between Hrant Papazian
    and John Hudson on legibility are welcome.

  body: Involved arguments from me &#40;theoretical, rhetorical, gastronomical, any
    kind really :-&#41; will have to wait until July 6, but what I can advise is to
    read anything you can find by Paul Luna, a major heavy at Oxford Dictionary, and
    a devout typophile. FYI, Luna is a big fan of Unger&#39;s work, but also recommends
    good &#39;ol Nimrod as a fallback. <BR> <BR>As for multi-script work, you&#39;re
    right, there&#39;s a huge lack of thoughtfulness and quality, and you can&#39;t
    blame the typographers entirely, because they lack the &#34;tools&#34; &#40;ie
    fonts&#41; to do it right. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html"

  body: So much depends on the size/leading of the type &#40;ie,  how much does the
    publisher want to minimize the number of pages&#41;, and the paper stock. <BR>
    <BR>My old Penguin Dictionary from the &#39;60s is set in 7/7 Plantin, and the
    stock is little better than newsprint, but the general effect is excellent &#40;were
    it not disintegrating&#41;. <BR> <BR>Chris Burke&#39;s new &#34;Celeste Text&#34;
    looks quite interesting for small size work.

    pages than what my fonts and design proposed: to give to the potential buyer the
    feeling that he got heavy, so a complete dictionnary. If it was too light and
    thin, the future reader &#34;impression on the object&#34; can be very wrong:
    &#34;Hey, for the same price between two dictionnaries, this one is more heavy
    and features more pages, its better one for sure!&#34;'
