  it so often. Times New Roman is the classic case.

    don't buy it. it's like saying there are no boring movies, no boring songs, no
    boring novels, no boring architecture... (choose your own metaphor)\r\n\r\nthat
    said, times can be interesting depending on how you use it, but because it is
    a \"default font\" in this digital era, it has lost much of its meaning and personality
    simply because of overuse. i think you'd have to use times (helvetica, gill sans,
    palatino, &c.) very well to make it look interesting these days. i concede that
    not everything has to be interesting, but rarely do you want your design to be
    downright dull, which is the problem of using overused fonts."

  body: paul, I hear you, but the problem with your metaphor is that while songs,
    movies, architecture are all forms of art, as typefaces are, they are not tools
    to achieve a final design, they are the final designs. Type is a tool of design.
    Type is the notes of a song - that can be stretched and pulled and organized to
    make a song, not the song itself. It is up to the artist to mold, alter, and design
    how that type appears. And if they just take an overused generic typeface right
    out of the box and lay it on the page, then yeah, kinda dull. But that's not the
    typeface's fault. It's the designers. Thoughts?

  body: "the problem with metaphors is that they're metaphors. a typeface is neither
    a song nor a note. you can liken a typeface to a tool, but a tool that leaves
    an unmistakable impression on the work it creates. maybe it is more like an ingredient
    in a cake, but sometimes a particular face can be the flour (a necessity) or it
    can be a pinch of spice (a luxury that makes the whole oh-so-much nicer). so you
    can say type is like this or like that, but type is type. and taste is taste.\r\nperhaps,
    though, you're right: it matters more how a typeface is used than the actual form
    of the typeface. perhaps i feel times is boring simply because most times i see
    it is en masse at a range of 10-12 pts on some regular leading. i'm sure there
    are other settings of times that could make it look fresh."

  body: "Only a typophile would be likely to ask this question. For most people, who
    are not obsessed with type, it is just something you read. If you can read it
    without distraction, or difficulty, then it is 'good type'. 'Like' or 'dislike'
    rarely enters into the mind -- it is the printed matter that absorbs the attention.
    I can still recall a time when I never thought about what typeface was used. It
    was just 'type'.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you can't read something without noticing
    the letters themselves and how they look on the page, then over-familiarity may
    make you frown inside, and say to yourself 'borrring', until you actually stop
    studying the no longer interesting typeface, and begin to read what it was used
    to say.\r\n\r\nFor me, I like variety, so a too-familiar typeface is uninteresting
    (maybe a better way to say it than boring). Often a familiar type at a larger
    size will show me things I didn't appreciate about it before, but as Paul says,
    at normal sizes it just becomes 'type' and not really a 'typeface'.\r\n\r\n- Mike
