    <BR> <BR>To get back to the original topic, I really appreciate fonts that come
    from The Hoefler Type Foundry. Now while some may consider my opinion biased due
    to the fact that I have worked with Jonathan for the last few years, I have genuinely
    found the HTF library incredibly useful for my needs as a graphic designer. The
    fonts range from classic text faces to contemporary display and are very well
    built and battle-tested at length before being released.  <BR> <BR>Now that Tobias
    Frere-Jones has joined Jonathan at HTF, I can think we can only expect great things
    to come.

    is not to deny the innovative quality of HTF typefaces in many areas, but it is
    subtle. <BR> <BR>The designers at HTF have all done experimental, more uniquely

    <BR>I have no problem with contemporary use of good typefaces from the 17th or
    20th centuries. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s conservative or innovative, as long
    as it&#39;s good. Of course, in typography suitability to the project is almost
    everything. To me that means there are contexts where something new is better,
    and contexts where something historical is better.  '

  body: 'The observation that the big money in type is typically associated with fairly
    conservative design can be interpreted in a number of ways, some of them clearly
    dubious. Proceeding from this observation to the conclusion that capitalism inhibits
    innovation requires making a number of assumptions. One of these assumptions is
    that innovation is measurable by the amount of money paid for a single product
    rather than on the number of products in the market. Obviously, in a capitalist
    economy, the number of products in the market is very much larger than in pre-capitalist
    or non-capitalist societies, and this is the usual measure of relative innovation,
    not how much money X producer obtained for Y product. Indeed, the greater the
    number of competing products in a market, the lower the average price will be.
    Since no capitalist economy is ever a purely capitalist economy -- not least because
    some notions of value are inherited from pre-capitalist societies, especially
    in &#39;craft&#39; businesses such as type design -- we should not automatically
    conflate conservatism in type design with a specifically capitalist status quo.
    Despite what the most ardent capitalists proclaim, there remain more ways of measuring
    value than the price the market will bear. The commissions that type designers
    like Jonathan and Tobias receive from magazines and newspapers reflect interesting
    and contradictory client desires: to have something new and fresh and distinctive,
    and to have something with an enduring value that is not merely fashionable. The
    fact that Jonathan and Tobias so regularly deliver and satisfy these contradictory
    desires is testament to their considerable skills.'

    <BR>Interesting. <BR> <BR>I think capitalism is actually highly dependent on cultural
    progress, because it is partly based on the idea of selling people stuff they
    either already have in some form &#40;a stylistic or functional upgrade, if you
    will&#41;, that they don&#39;t really need &#40;pure luxury&#41; or that satisfies
    the basic human desires &#40;among them: greed&#41;. <BR> <BR>This wouldn&#39;t
    be possible, if the good ol&#39; wheel were not reinvented and remarketed as a
    &#39;brand-new must-have circular motion device&#39; on a regular basis and if
    the stylistic definition of &#39;mainstream&#39; didn&#39;t undergo a subtle but
    seismic shift every now and then. <BR> <BR>So, capitalism needs to at least look
    as if it&#39;s moving forward all of the time, even if it doesn&#39;t. It achieves
    this by using cultural splinter groups as &#39;idea incubators&#39; on the fringes
    of the mainstream, testing what might work on a mass scale. If they have something,
    the mainstream moves to gobble it up, the fringes move elsewhere. <BR> <BR>The
    devious achievement of capitalism is in permitting and not repressing this process,
    a system which feeds off those that oppose it to reinvent itself and thereby stifle
    this opposition. <BR> <BR>If it weren&#39;t just human nature, I&#39;d call it

    <BR>The thing I don&#39;t like about Victorian design, and that I sense, rightly
    or wrongly, in Hoefler&#39;s designs, is that ornament is somehow laid on, rather
    than organic.  <BR> <BR>For example, I don&#39;t like the very sharp but old style
    serifs on Hoefler Text and Requiem. These are something new, I think, but to me
    they don&#39;t work.  <BR> <BR>Knockout is I think by intention is more reminiscent
    of the Victorian predecessors than many modern sans grotesques. I don&#39;t know
    enough to tell you the difference, but whatever they are I don&#39;t like look.
    For example the wide &#39;a&#39; with the small tail I don&#39;t like, and some
    of the way the thick-thin transitions are handled on the heavier weights.  <BR>
    <BR>Now it may be that my reaction is influenced by my age. My &#40;late&#41;
    grandparents grew up in the Victorian era, and to me Victorian design always looks
    fussy and stuffy.  <BR> <BR>I lived in London for five years, and saw plenty of
    genuine Victorian stuff, but still never warmed to it. I felt as one of my teachers
    back then said, that it was as if during the Georgian period the builders could
    do no wrong, and in the Victorian they could do no right. <BR> <BR>Maybe those
    in a younger generation, like Hoefler are less prejudiced than I and can see the
    merits in the Victorian taste. But to me it almost always seems to have forced
    and laid-on ornament. <BR> <BR>Just not to be misunderstood, I am not against
    ornament. In the art nouveau and art deco periods I think they did wonderful things
    with ornament--and before. Queen Victoria, I am not amused. '

    nymphs on rocks for 26 years is one mighty attractive consideration. &#34;. .

  body: "In fact, I wonder if anyone will find this, way at the bottom of a 2 1/2
    year old thread, but what the heck. \r\n\r\nJonathan didn't work for me directly,
    or in the same room for long stretches. He knew all about the history and styles
    before I found him and all I really showed him was how the spaces and spacing
    worked, what all the modern characters were used for, and how \"the business worked.\"
    I gave him a few projects to do and he honed his skills on his own, and was soon
    as busy as I was. Tobias knew less about the history and styles but for him the
    spaces and spacing, and what all the characters were for, was natural and known,
    respectively. He was not interested in the business at all. And then, he absorbed
    the history rapidly under the influence of myself, but more from Black, Parker
    and Carter while my main task was to see that he had interesting projects along
    with the dozens he had in mind. \r\n\r\nWhether or not you like their work, or
    you choose to tangent off into the relationship between commerce and art, it's
    an interesting duo. But what's clear to me, from reading this long dead thread,
    is that type design, in the case when the goal is a product, for either general
    or specific use, is not an art, and you need a patron, if not a client to get
    the best out of the best. \r\n\r\n\"I've been painting nymphs on rocks for 13
    years. I could do it for another 13 years. The commercial market tempts one to
    repeat oneself.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Nymph might also have Something to do with it
    ... don't you think?/|\\ ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Great bits of \"internal history\" - thank you. And yeah, nymphs rule.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the Typophile \"tracker\"* lists threads by most-recent activity (and -if you're
    logged in- shows how many unread posts a thread has), which is the only way (now
    that email delivery is suspended) of staying on top of all the action. And since
    your Frankenstein-style electric jolt this thread has been towards the top of
    the list. But to find a dormant (never dead) thread like this [was], you'd have
    to throw something like \"site:http://www.typophile.com berlow\" at Google, and
    click on result #13 (at the moment).  :-)\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/tracker\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
