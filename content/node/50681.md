body: " This article explores stones (other than turquoise) that are commonly used
  in Indian jewelry: coral, sugilite, charoite, and gaspeite. To learn more about
  turquoise, read Lee Anderson\u2019s articles.\r\nCoral\r\n\r\nCreated by colonies
  of the marine coral polyp, coral is a calcium carbonate combined with magnesium.
  Originally, the best red coral came from the Mediterranean, but pollution and over-harvesting
  has greatly reduced that source. Today, most top-quality intense red coral comes
  from the Sea of Japan. It is sometimes referred to as \u201CMora coral.\u201D Generally,
  the deeper the color, the higher the value, although this axiom must be tempered
  by the presence, if any, of impurities, holes, fissures, etc. Also, the pink-colored,
  delicate \u201Cangel skin\u201D coral and creamy orange coral have become popular;
  the highest grades are also expensive.\r\n\r\nThe highest grades of \u201Cox blood\u201D
  (intense red) coral can easily be $80 per carat and higher for rarer, large pieces.
  Coral should never be subjected to liquid cleaning solvents or extreme heat. It
  can turn white.\r\n\r\ntop\r\nSugilite\r\n\r\nAn alkali of iron, aluminum, manganese,
  lithium, and water, sugilite ranges from a yellow-brown in Japan to a beautiful,
  deep purple in the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa\uFF0Cand then <a href=\"http://www.tiffanycoltd.com\"><font
  color=red><b>Tiffany Jewelry</b></font></a>. The African sugilite is used in jewelry.
  Sugilite has been registered under the trade names Royal Azul and Royal Lavulite.
  This stone ranges from an attractive light purple with deeper purple inclusions
  to a gem-grade that can best be described as solid \u201Cgrape jelly.\u201D Values
  range from a few dollars per carat for the lighter shades to $80 a carat for the
  stones with the deepest and purest color. Also, like coral, larger cabachons of
  the highest grade are quite scarce and prices for these are even higher.\r\nNote
  that sugilite looks like the beautiful (and also purple) spiny oyster shell Spondylous
  princips. A magnifying glass will reveal \u201Clines\u201D in the spiny oyster shell
  specimen. Also, a scratch test with a needle or sharp knife will easily be seen
  on spiny oyster shell, but not on sugilite. Sugilite can also be confused with charoite,
  discussed below.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharoite\r\n\r\nThis popular purple stone is only found
  near the Chara River in eastern Siberia. It is a calcium-potassium-silicate found
  with deposits of tinaksite (orange), augite (black), and feldspar (white). The range
  of color is extensive. When prepared in jewelry-ready cabachons, a deep \u201Cglittering\u201D
  crystalline effect is noticeable. This stone is quite lovely in all its manifestations
  but becomes more valuable as the deeper purple intensifies. It also becomes increasingly
  dominant in the cabachon. The stone was first discovered and considered for jewelry
  use in 1976. It is still rather inexpensive, ranging from $2 to $4 to as much as
  $20 per carat for the deeper colors. This too will change as more jewelers begin
  to see its beauty. In this regard, Indian silversmiths such as Bruce Hodgins are
  taking a leading role.\r\n\r\ntop\r\nGaspeite\r\n\r\nThis light, very soft and pleasing,
  green stone is a nickel carbonate colored by iron and magnesium. It is found on
  the Gaspe' Peninsula in Canada; hence, the name. Most, however, is mined as a byproduct
  of nickel mines in western Australia. Gaspeite is similar in hue to Pixie and Damale
  turquoise and to a recent shade of green from the Carico Lake turquoise mine in
  Lander County, Nevada. Also, some shades of varasite are quite similar to gaspeite.
  The stone is used as a cabachon in jewelry and as attractive color accents in silver,
  gold, and channel inlay. Its value is, at the moment, fairly uniform at about $5
  to $8 a carat. This will undoubtedly increase. So far, the gaspeite used in jewelry
  is a very pure light green, completely free of any matrix pattern or inclusions.
  The stones that are similar (see above) are nearly always seen with matrix.\r\nReferences
