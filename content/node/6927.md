body: I don&#39;t mean to be an opportunist. I actually read everything on these boards,
  but rarely post due to my own lack of experience. The critiques here are great,
  though. <BR> <BR>This is a personal project for my Ultimate Disc team. I don&#39;t
  know how many of you will know what <a href="http://www.upa.org">Ultimate</a> is,
  but it&#39;s an intensely competitive sport  that plays kind of like a mixture of
  soccer and football &#40;or football and football, I suppose&#41;. <BR> <BR>This
  is the official <a href="http://www.utexas.edu">University of Texas</a> team, which
  is where the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/visualguidelines/vg_colors.html">colors</a>
  and the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/visualguidelines/vg_longhorn.html">Longhorn
  mark</a> are taken from. <BR> <BR>Handlettered and traced from scan. <BR> <BR><img

    lettering.. &#41;</i> <BR> <BR>What seems a bit odd and what I dont think is working
    right now is the longhorn part.. <BR><i>&#40; The perspective seems wrong.. Do
    you have to use / show the longhorn.? &#41;</i> <BR> <BR>If you have to incorporate
    the original longhorn icon &#40; the &#39;<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/visualguidelines/graphics/longhorn_mark.gif"
    target="_blank">Standard Logo</a>&#39; &#41;, what about adding it as some kind
    of &#39;trademark&#39;.? <i>&#40; Maybe.. Make it smaller, about half the size
    of the type, and add it to the top right of the &#39;tuff&#39; mark.. &#41;</i>

  body: Yes, definitely having trouble with the perspective.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going
    to be playing around with different incarnations of the horns and possibly the
    full Bevo &#40;that&#39;s the official name for the longhorn head&#41;.

  body: I like the tuff part &#40;you are showing skills!&#41;, but what I miss, is
    the ultimate/frisbee inclination. To me the circle is just a circle, whith no
    particular meaning. <BR> <BR>You could disconnect the circle/frisbee form the
    tuff letterhead, for example. This might give you more freedom. You could then
    even try to implement the horns on the double f. <BR> <BR>regards <BR>---Jacques

  body: What about placing the horns, &#40;if they must be in the logo&#41; onto the
    type and lose the circle. <BR> <BR>Circle is superflious to me. And brings the
    lush type logo down a scale or two. <BR> <BR>Horns need to be stylized so that

  body: not to be a party-pooper or anything, but the lettering says &#34;cute&#34;
    to me rather than &#34;tuff&#34; i dunno if that really matters at all. other
    than that the lettering is very nice, i just don&#39;t get a hard-edged vibe from
    the look as i do the name. just my two bits.

    tough&#34; angle is great, but otherwise some &#34;edge&#34; &#40;not necessarily
    brutality&#41; might help. Here&#39;s an idea: give the insides of the counters
    abrupt angle changes, or even a square cut, instead of smooth curves. Sort of

    <BR>but seriously, i like the &#34;cute&#34; logo. it just doesn&#39;t say &#34;tough&#34;
    to me. maybe it&#39;s too smooth, too curvy, too clean. to make it a bit more
    rugged, maybe give it a ruffer treatment: try distressing the letters, making
    the shapes more angular, or something i don&#39;t know will really work but: make
    the lettershapes a bit &#34;bulgy&#34; like muscles or sumfin. but then again
    that could be way too cheesy. just a couple ideas. <BR>i really like dana&#39;s
    &#34;u&#34; as longhorn concept. i think with the right treatment, it could be
    a totally rockin logotype!'

  body: Then I&#39;m pissed-off-happy! Your idea is great. Just maybe make them more
    obviously horns, like curl them and pointy them more. Since the sport in question
    is probably not limited to graphic designers there&#39;s such a thing as too much
    subtlety. <BR> <BR>hhp

    keeping pace with all the suggestions that I really want to try out now. I very
    much appreciate all of the generous feedback. <BR> <BR>I liked the idea of making
    the counter into a bevo shape, so here&#39;s a rough rendering of that. I&#39;d
    also like to play around with David, Scott, and Dana&#39;s suggestions. <BR> <BR>Also,
    I forgot to mention that the primary application of this mark is screen-printing
    on dri-fit jerseys. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/50227.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>The effect as I have rendered it is kind of jarring. I probably
    need to make it cut into the stroke width a good deal less, but this is the digi
    equivalent of rough sketch.

  body: This looks like it&#39;s going to snap in half now.  Not exactly what I would
    call tuff.   I think your original sketch had a good start.  I think mounting
    the logotype onto a bevo head shape makes it look more solid.

  body: 'I&#39;m pulling a Frankenstein here. I got some great advice the first time
    around, but ultimately they were looking less in the &#34;baseball&#34; direction.
    <BR> <BR>Actually, the first question I&#39;m going to ask is more of a philosophical
    one: How do I convince them to go with something that I know is good over something
    that I know is bad? I&#39;m not a professional designer, and I don&#39;t have
    any formal design education, but I can more or less tell the difference between
    good and bad. A few people on the team have their own ideas, but quite honestly
    they suck. Even if the ideas were good, they wouldn&#39;t have the technical skill
    to execute them properly. <BR> <BR>What method do you use to deal with a client
    who apparently doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s good for themselves? I&#39;m only the
    &#34;expert&#34; in this situation by default, but still... <BR> <BR>Anyway, here
    is the new direction I&#39;m trying to go. I&#39;m actually really pleased with
    this idea. I think it&#39;s recognizable but still contains familiar references.
    I wanted something angular and geometric looking &#40;see bottom&#41;, but still
    balanced. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/55816.gif"

    alt=""> <BR> <BR>I think my teammates really like the identity of another Ultimate
    tema, and are using that as kind of a mental starting point. Here it is for reference.
    This trucker hat was the best example I could find, but you get the idea. <BR>

    or maybe that&#39;s my up-coming colorado ski trip talking. I think the light
    on dark is not very aggressive, and I think that your original looked like a sports
    team, not just baseball, but with some angles it would have been good for football,
    or in this case, ultimate.  <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s talk lame clients. I always find
    it&#39;s good to take a back seat when fielding complaints, lying in wait for
    the right time to go at it. Let them air out all grievences and worries, there
    will be a lot. If your solution is the right one, you can tackle each complaint

    then you can explain why your solution is good. They like the simple mark? Tell
    them it&#39;s old skewl and simple, but doesn&#39;t say who they are! The tuff
    mark is old skewl and simple, and with some angles &#40;just an idea&#41; would
