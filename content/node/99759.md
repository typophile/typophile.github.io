    I'd rather not be an accessory to font piracy - although in this case it would
    be too late.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I believe that the only commercial versions were
    rip-offs of the free Black Chancery</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm sure that does happen,
    and it could certainly be the case here. I guess the question is: what's worse,
    tricking a large number of users who like a cheesy cheap font out of some money,
    or harming an individual type designer - but also indirectly type design in general?
    Probably they're about equally bad.\r\n\r\nAnd Dick's flippant, subversive reply

  body: "hrant- You object, out of hand, sight unseen, uninvestigated, to any ID response
    that mentions a free font. Given the general population here in Typophile, I think
    that before assailing such responses, you should perform your own due diligence
    instead of your automatic \"if it's free it's probably a clone\" (read: \"criminally
    pirated\").  I would think that most posters first suggest commercial fonts from
    reputable sources.\r\n\r\nThere are many free things in life that are either unique
    or superior to commercial offerings. Here in Southern California, local newspapers
    such as Los Angeles' Downtown News certainly have no impact on the sales of the
    Los Angeles Times. There is a clear place and audience for both. So it is with
    fonts and almost everything else.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    I'd be posting a <em>lot</em> more...  :-/\r\n\r\nIn every case I restrict myself
    to \"probable cause\". In this case I actually do sort of remember seeing a commercial
    font that looks like that. I could be wrong, and as I admitted the commercial
    one could be a copy of a free one! But it's never vindictiveness that I'm acting
    on.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I would think that most posters first suggest commercial
    fonts from reputable sources.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI mostly agree. I think the
    real problem is that the people asking are generally not so honorable, and many
    people helping them don't want to face that reality. So it's not that free fonts
    are being suggested (there are indeed some good ones, that are not plagiarized)
    it's that:\r\n- Plagiarized fonts are often suggested (often unknowingly, but
    often a result of not caring to check).\r\n- The commercial fonts being suggested
    are usually being pirated. Now, I admit there's no Proof of that. But <em>at least</em>
    when all the signs are there (especially when there's an admission!) people should
    confront that.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the right people and things aren't being helped
    (in my view).\r\n\r\nWishful thinking is no substitute for good judgement.\r\n\r\nBTW,
