  you know the fonts? At first I thought the nameplate was set in Clifford, but this
  font is a little more narrower. The others are too small for me to recognize. I\u2019m
  not that good with the classics. I was thinking something like Kis or Freight or
  Alisal.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_0005_mucca_oceanhouse_logo_4010.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_0003_mucca_oceanhouse_business_card_4260.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_0004_mucca_oceanhouse_detail_4481.jpg]\r\n\r\nMikey
