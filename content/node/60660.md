  and i'm running a script that change italics in the text to Charactere styles. The
  script only works if the italics are named as italics.\r\n\r\nBut Archer is using
  'Book italic' as a name and not 'italic' so the script doesn't work\u2026 !\r\n\r\nIs
  there anyway i can correct this in the font file, using a text editor, or is too
  complicated/impossible ?\r\nI have no code abilities, btw."

  body: To me it makes more sense changing the script to recognize "Book Italic" than
    changing the font. Besides, Archer's EULA might not even allow you to modify the
    font.

  body: "This thread has some similarities to another over at the <a href=http://forums.adobe.com/message/1946302#1946302>InDesign
    Scripting forum</a>.  Miguel Sousa already suggested that it would be wiser --
    not to mention much simpler -- to modify a script than to change the names in
    a font family.  The script discussed over on the ID forum is a standard *.JSX
    javascript, not compiled, so it can be modified.  And the author, [Jongware],
    might well happen along here, to explain things better.  Still, his contributions
    over there mention the strategy of <strong>temporarily</strong> changing the fonts
    in an InDesign document to a family using the the usual variants (regular, italic,
    bold, and bold italic) in order to run the JSX script that relies on them.  After
    running the script, InDesign's \"Find Font\" command can quickly change all instances
    of, say, Times NR's \"italic\" to Archer's \"book italic\".  As for footnotes,
    InDesign's can search them, but only if that is included in the search options:
    check out the options disguised as icons below \"Search:\" on the Find/Change
    menu.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "Ah. The request did ring some bells :-)\r\n\r\nYes, David is correct on both
    accounts. Changing the font <em>temporarily</em> doesn't do no harm, and I forgot
    Find/Change in InDesign can be explicitly set to exclude footnotes ...\r\n\r\nTheunis

  body: "This morning it suddenly occured to me. It is no problem at all.\r\n\r\nWhat
    NLX should do is <em>first</em> replace his \"Book Italic\" with a character style
    of choice and only <em>then</em> run the script to apply character styles to the
    rest of italics. The script is smart enough to leave existing character styles
    unchanged!"
