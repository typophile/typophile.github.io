body: "is FF Unit realy suitable for signage systems? it was designed for that purpose
  but obviously it doesn't have (all) characters for some countries like ex-yugoslav
  republics for example.\r\n\r\nnow it's available in three versions: Unit 1, 2 and
  3 but i still haven't found which one is suitable for signage. maybe you know a
  better signage typeface?\r\n\r\n"

  body: FF Unit is a fine face for signage -- compact but very open and legible. <a
    href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_unit_complete_collection_pro/">FF
    Unit Pro</a> contains all Central European character sets and should support the
    languages you need, including Bosnian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Sorbian. See the

  body: "no cyrillic needed. the problem is that ff unit doesn't have all 5 diacritic
    characters of the ex-yu languages.\r\n\r\nnow, i suppose Unit Pro version does
    have them all but the OT version doesn't?"
