  (light, regular & bold), I've almost finished the regular version and I have the
  ligh's & bold's without the accents and some other glyphs.\r\n\r\nWhich, do you
  think, is the best way of building a typeface of several weights without using Multiple
  Master*? \r\n\r\n*I've used it, making a weight axis (light & bold) but the regular
  strokes and curves doesen't quite convince me, and it takes me a lot of work to
  design the glyphs in ligh and bold to be able to see the regular version...\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    differences in contrast such as a very light weight and a bold weight. Using anisotropic
    interpolation (in Superpolator or UFOstretch) will give you a regular weight that\u2019s
    a good starting point but will need a great deal of cleanup work before the design
    is finished. Once the regular master is done you can then interpolate between
    the three masters to get everything you need."
