body: "In my sophomore year (now a senior) we were required to make a typeface. Although
  that was just the beginning of the assignment, the second parts like making a specimen,
  won't help me now. Needless to say, since that class I've fallen in love with type.
  Researching, reading, but never producing anything.\r\n\r\nI've decided that as
  a personal project, I would like to revisit what I originally called December and
  take the forms created in illustrator and turn them in to an actual font. Lowercase,
  numerals, so on and so forth. I've picked up \"Learn Fontlab Fast\" and I'm about
  to dive in over the weekend. I have some sketches for lowercase, and already plan
  on refining some of the shapes. But I figured why not see what the masters at typophile
  have to say. \r\n\r\nI've attached two images, one of the grid and one of a setting
  I did while I was working on the other parts of the assignment. I've learned a lot
  since then, I can already see problems with parts, but fresh eyes might see something
  I'm missing.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, and I look forward to becoming more and
  more involved with type design and this fun place.\r\n\r\n-MDF\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_3760.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type2_5395.jpg]"

    all vertical strokes are heavier than all vertical curves, so make them fatter,
    even fatter than the vertical strokes."

    other things after I get a chance to work on it this weekend.
