body: just wondering. a local newspaper is offering an online version of the whole,
  daily issue now and the pdfs have all used fonts embedded &#40;something like 40
  embedded fonts on one advert side for example&#41;. isn&#39;t that &#34;illegal&#34;?

  body: Depends on fonts&#39; EULA. Some &#40;eg. Adobe, Nick Shinn&#41; allow it,
    some don&#39;t.

  body: well, as they have the complete issue online i&#39;ll guess they won&#39;t
    check every font&#39;s eula... all adverts are also included in the online version
    - with all fonts embedded &#40;company logos and so on&#41;...

  body: For OpenType or TrueType fonts the PDF creation process should verify the
    embedding permissions encoded within each font file. Although these fonts would
    be set to embeddable, an individual EULA might still restrict posting the document
    on the Web or may claim that the PDF copy of the paper is a &#39;commercial product&#39;
    which requires an additional license. <BR> <BR>As for Type 1 which has no embedding
    bits, the responsibility for checking the EULA lies with the publisher. <BR> <BR>Si
