  (fonts) market each year? \r\n\r\nThis figure would include the revenue of all the
  indie foundries, of the large players like Monotype, and of resellers like FontShop
  and MyFonts, webfont services like Typekit, but exclude type-related software products
  like FontLab or Linotype FontExplorer X. Basically all the revenue that is generated
  directly through font files.\r\n\r\nWhat's your guess?"

    of roughly $31,556,000.\r\n\r\nNow the question is, how much of a market share
    does MT have in this area? A lot of their sales (and growth in creative professionals
    revenue) is from non-web, direct to corporate customer sales. I take they own
    a very large share of that market, but am unsure about the web retail market.
    Given that they own fonts.com, this will also be a decent chunk. But Myfonts.com
    is of course not yet on their balance, given they only acquired it in 2012.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<img

    levels are often much lower than the US and Western Europe. These are also places

    easily addressed by mapping font prices to geography, verified by IP address and

    \ Most of the work involves the diacritics which are rarely seen in English but
    essential to most other languages that use the Latin script.\r\nRegarding pricing
    dovetailed to users,  I don't think it is just a geographical issue.  There are
    plenty of $5 font users in the Americas and Europe.  I don't see how anyone could
    enforce it without great cost.  We cannot even enforce the system we have.  There
    are type designers all over the World including the countries you might target
    as having a lower cost of living.  The type designers there share that lower cost
    of living and can support their own nations if they so desire.  It would be equally
    unfair for a type designer living in the UK and paying that cost of living to
    sell his work at less than he needs to survive where he lives.\r\nI am more in
    favor of letting the type designer choose their own market or markets and doing
    the work that fulfills those needs.  The clients of course decide with their wallets
    if the design has missed the mark.  This eliminates the need for the income-level
    police from, most likely badly, enforcing the rules.  Any wealthy person can buy
    an IP address from Mumbai so who are we helping? Only the poor have no options.

    is that a majority of the posts and posters here really only are looking at desktop
    sales and not counting OEM licensing at all. While Font Bros enjoys a fair and
    growing share of desktop sales for its foundries, we're best at obtaining a good

    rate, same as our rate on desktop sales.\r\n\r\nI think it's short sided to only
    look at annual desktop sales to determine the whole ball of wax and there isn't
    any designer among us who isn't thrilled to still make income off of fonts made
    5 or 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nThis sorta gets back to the original topic about all
    distributors which is to say each has their own audience and it took me many years
    to figure this out. It makes perfect sense that a foundry could do great at 10
    distributors without harming its own income, yet it becomes a matter of convenience
    for those who just don't want to hassle with setting up and maintaining their

    thought is simply that the duration of time a font has been 'out' directly affects
    the saturation of that font in the marketplace and accordingly the number of folks
    who find and wish to use it outside of the scope of it's initial EULA or licensed
    uses.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that older released fonts receive perhaps 4-8x as
    many OEM licensing requests as newer ones, so if you look at older more established
    foundries with a large body of work, chances are OEM font licensing could be anywhere
    from 20% to up to 45% of their annual income.\r\n\r\nWe also cannot rule out income
    generated from infringement settlements in cases where the font use has been egregiously
    abused and law suits are required to remedy these cases - It is a random thing,

  body: "Unless you do a \u201Csplit run\u201D\u2014i.e. selling the same product
    with different advertising/pricing to equal segments of the same market\u2014then
    you have no way of telling how a variable such as price is affecting sales.\r\n\r\nWith
    multiple distributors, the same price point will produce different results. Some
    cater to customers with more \u201Chouse money\u201D, presumably, among other
    factors. \r\n\r\nComplicating matters further, any optimum price point will vary
    according to the features and language support of a font."
