    target=_top>Assay Regular</a> from Solo. <BR>The &#34;big&#34; differences I&#39;ve
    seen are the &#34;e&#34; &#40;that looks a little out of shape in the sample&#41;
    and the serif of the &#34;d&#34;, but curiously in the Solotype Catalog &#40;p.9&#41;
    besides other styles of Assay you can see that &#34;d&#34; with the lower serif.
    <BR> <BR>And not so close but probably going to the same gym   <a href="http://www.woodentypefonts.com/Pages/gothcav1.html"
    target=_top>Gothic Tuscan Concave</a> from Wooden Type Fonts.
