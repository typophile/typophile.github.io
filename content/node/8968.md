body: This sample from the &#39;early &#39;80&#39;s&#39; was sent to me for an ID,
  and I have so far been unable to come up with a typeface to match it. I thought
  if <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/glaser-stencil/d/testdrive.html?s=JOHN+COUGAR+MATTERS&amp;p=36"
  target="_blank">Glaser Stencil</a> came in a Solid form it would be very close,
  but I can&#39;t find anything in my Photo-Lettering, Solotype of Phil&#39;s Photo
  catalogs. Although Milton Glaser did work for Photo-Lettering for a while, the only
  other fonts of his that I saw had some resemblances but were not plain headline-style
  type like this sample. <BR> <BR>My only other digital alternative was Adobe Insignia
  &#40;&amp; Alts&#41; mixed with some Futura, and that&#39;s painful. <BR> <BR>Anyone
  have any clues what this might be? If it&#39;s something that hasn&#39;t been digitized,
  what would you suggest as a near duplicate?  <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help.

    you&#39;re a fan. We all have albums from the 80s we&#39;re embarrassed about.
    Most of them don&#39;t have groovy fonts on them though.'

  body: Hehe. No, &#39;fraid not. Is this the same guy as Mellenkamp? &#40;Shows how
    much of a &#39;fan&#39; I am.&#41; <BR> <BR>However, looking at old albums for
    interesting type samples does sound like a fun idea.

  body: I think somebody just had it set in Glaser Stencil and just modified it. It
    would not have been difficult to do.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also possible that it
    was some custom font created by a type house. I&#39;ve heard stories from people
    who used to work at places like that and they used to routinely make custom versions
    of fonts for clients, assuming they had the budget for it.

  body: So you agree that Glaser Stencil seems to fit the same &#39;bones&#39;?   <BR>
    <BR>Any close digital alternatives you can think of? <BR> <BR>Thanks Mark.

    of any close alternatives, but Font Bureau&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/book/testdrive.html?s=JOHN+COUGER+MATTERS&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Eagle</a> or Neville Brody&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-typeface-6-and-7/"
    target="_blank">Typeface 6 and 7</a> come to mind. There&#39;s an old metal face
    called Vogue which would be similar, too. I don&#39;t know any digital versions,
    except <a href="http://www.terminaldesign.com/custom_mag_vanFair_01.shtml" target="_blank">VF
    Sans</a> which James Montalbano did for Vanity Fair is similar. <BR> <BR>Incidentally,
    Glaser originally called his typeface &#34;Neo Futura&#34; since it was, according
    to him, based on Futura. I&#39;d say it was a loose interpretation. I suspect
    they changed the name when it was released to the public. Also, his original design
    had three weights. In addition to the two we know &#40;light and bold&#41; there
    was an even lighter weight. This info was culled from the big Milton Glaser Graphic
    Design book which was published in the late seventies. One last note: There were
    no &#34;non-stencil&#34; versions of this face mentioned.'
