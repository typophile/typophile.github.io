  body: So the experiment is in challenging the boundaries of legibility? I can still
    read it, so you may not have gone far enough, though that "W" at the beginning
    was a stumbling block. I initially read that more as "lxl". The rest is pretty
    clear.

  body: why is 'your' underlined? it feels forced, and the rule is not really in keeping
    with the lettering. maybe if it curved up or down on one end? but even then, the
    emphasis seems unnecessary, and sounds like "what's in <em>your</em> wallet?"

  body: "The first question to ask yourself is, \"What am I trying to achieve with
    this piece\"? Then you (and we) can have an idea of where you are going. It's
    hard to critique something if we don't know what the goal of the design is, or
    what the exhibition is about.\r\n\r\n(Also, this type of query should be posted
    in the Critique or Design forums.)"

  body: "Richard: \r\n\r\nI guess I should have explained better the the actual concept
    in the first place. \r\nThink of the text as something temporary - the words will
    probably change. The subject of the exhibition is \"in focus\", and my piece will
    be about what focus your life has. \r\n\r\nI'm going to split the sentence into
    4 parts, sort of like a puzzle. Each part will be printed on a transparent sheet.
    The four sheets are hanging from the roof on a straight line behind each other
    with 50 cm space between them. I'll shrink the parts according to perspective,
    making the \"whole picture\" only visible from a certain point in the room. \r\n\r\nViewing
    just one of the sheets will not make any sense, and I'm trying to make it even
    more unrecognizable by building the letters with these lines and curves as seen
    above.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm actually only looking for help on improving the actual
    shapes of the letters."

    can tell me is that it fails.

  body: "You state your objective is <em>not</em> to challenge legibility, The letter
    shapes you have chosen do exactly that. It succeeds at what your objective is
    not, so your true objective, if actually achieved, is not readily apparent. This
    can be interpreted as failure.\r\n\r\nYour plan to break up the line of text on
    multiple planes is enough to make this difficult for the viewer. Don't make it
    harder on them by using letter shapes that are not readily recognizable even when
    viewed from the angle that assembles the text. A simple geometric sans face such
    as a light weight of Futura should be enough if the letters are suspended in this
    multi-plane system."

  body: Thanks for explaining the concept, Frank -- sounds cool. As for the letter
    shapes, I too had a bit of trouble with <strong>W</strong> and only got it from
    the context. I feel that the <strong>a</strong> could use some changes too, maybe
    because the teardrop shape is a bit narrow. Also, there is less space between
    the strokes of the <strong>y</strong> than in the other characters shown here.

    I just found myself rewriting most of the characters.

  body: One thing I was thinking about after I posted my comments is that your strokes
    might be a bit thin if they will be seen from a distance... So you might want
    to do some testing with 1:1 prints, hanging them from a wall and stepping back
    to look at them.

    an unforgivingly thin stem, a great challenge, well done. Stop. :)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "I agree with Cuttlefish, though the advice may not be well-recieved. When
    I was at Cranbrook, there were plenty of designers (Alen Hori, Scott Makela) \"destroying
    legibility.\" Trust me, that is what you are doing. It's cool, really. But the
    problem is we are not seeing a photo of the installation, but instead a screen
    shot of the \"perfect\" view of the letter forms. I doubt most viewers will recognize
    them as type when you further fragment them as you describe. Futura is a wonderful,
    amazing font. When you break it up it wil resemble clearly drawn lines and shapes.
    When you stand at the perfect spot, the cosmos will come into focus and you will
    get the \"aha!\" moment you crave. \r\n\r\nH. Todd Duren, \r\ndesigner. educator.
