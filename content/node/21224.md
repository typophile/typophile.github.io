  for participation, excellence in individual fields and a few other general categories.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help me with choosing the right fonts for the job under 3 categories. I already
  have a few on my mind mentioned below. Please don\u2019t hesitate to comment on
  them too\r\n\r\n1.Serif : I have Scala, Nexus & Berkeley \r\n2.Sans: Univers, Flama,
  The Sans \r\n3.Cursive/Script : Bickham Script Pro, Palace Script, Flemish Script\r\n\r\nIf
  it\u2019s not too much can someone suggest what colors will look good for certificates.
  These certificates are for a Medical University.\r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly
  appreciated. Thanks in advance\r\n\r\nLordKV\r\n"

    examples? :^)

    some suggestions regarding the fonts. \r\n\r\nAre there any normally recommended
    fonts for designing certificates, I mean any favorites which people have been
    using for ages and have become almost standard for them?"

  body: "I think the problem with most certificates is they do rely on what has been
    done. The intent of a certificate is to give the recipient tangible proof of there
    achievement. With that it needs to \"feel\" and \"look\" worthy of this. \r\n\r\nFor
    the cursive script I might recommend <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/ihof/zanerproset.html\">Zaner
    Pro</a>. The upside of this is two-fold. It is based upon the writing style of
    a lettering teacher who might have done something which needs decoration. The
    second being it was digitized by our own Paul Hunt. Take a peek at it. I'd say
    the way the name appears will set the tone for the rest of it. \r\n\r\nIs the
    border set, or are you designing that as well?"

  body: "Thank you Ms.Tiffany. Yeah the borders set. But instead of the usual borders
    surrounding all over I decided to use just two, on the top and bottom with a simple
    design. I am sorry I know I am not making much sense typing. I will upload a preview
    once I am done. Zaner looks cool though. Might check it out.\r\n\r\n"

    you are choosing the typefaces. '

    the pic.\r\n\r\nThe fonts used are Scala Serif & Sans + Old English Text"

  body: "I detect a serif on the underlying shield. Is that Scala Serif? If not, have
    you considered using it?\r\n\r\nOne point ... Can you get the name of the Dean
    in sans, as well as the signature? Most university officials signatures cannot
    be read by humans :) and in the future the grad might want to know the name that
    is scribbled on the form.\r\n\r\nAlso, be aware that the college might want more
    than one signature. When I was involved with the University of Toronto, there
    were up to four signatures on the degrees."

  body: "Thank you for the suggestions. The font used on the logo is Palatino. Yes
    the name of the Dean will be mentioned in Sans. This is just a rough outline.
    What do you think of it so far? As far as the no of persons signing it, there
    would be only one and hence the space for one.\r\n\r\nI have one more crazy idea.
    IS it okay to put a frame around it. I mean in photoshop using some nice wood
    texture. Sorry if it is too silly.\r\n\r\nAlso what about if I just play around
    with the hues and make similar certificates (changing the borders of course) for
    other purposes like participation in a camp, best student and faculty etc.\r\n\r\nAnd
    finally does it look okay from a University point of view\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nLordKV"

  body: "A good certificate needs...\r\n\r\n - lots of white space\r\n - a pattern
    somewhere\r\n - black ink + red emphasis\r\n - to be letterpress printed\r\n\r\nA
    typical certificate has...\r\n\r\n - a bunch of blackface type\r\n - a bunch of
    calligraphic type\r\n - printed on a lazer printer\r\n - been stuck in a $2 frame\r\n\r\nSo,
    my advice would be to design a certificate that you'd fine aesthetically pleasing
    enough to hang up on a wall as an actual piece of art.\r\n\r\n"
