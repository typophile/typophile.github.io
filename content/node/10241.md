body: Hello, my name is Hubert Jocham and I have not been very active in this forum.
  but here is something I work at the moment. It is a Serif font with some unsual
  shapes. There is only upper and lower case yet. Reading is quite strange at the
  beginning, but you never know as a designer if people accept forms like that.  <BR>Anyway
  here is the pdf  <BR>

  body: Interesting shapes. I&#39;d probably agree that this isn&#39;t something which
    should be used to set a textbook. However, I could see it being used for poetry
    or some other short setting. I really like the rationalized shape changes. I find
    the _g_ to bee odd, but it is working in the smaller setting.

  body: 'I think this is pretty cool. <BR> <BR>I can think of some tweaks, but wouldn&#39;t
    want to intrude too much into the &#34;structures&#34; of such an obviously personal
    effort. Two things that do stand out as needing change though: <BR>- I would splay
    the legs of the UC &#34;M&#34;. <BR>- Most of all: I would quickly change the
    &#34;z&#34; to have &#34;conventional&#34; stroke contrats! It looks really disruptive
    the way it is. You could do that in the italic though I guess. <BR> <BR>Nice stuff.

  body: I only spent half a day on the upper case yet. They are difficult anyway in
    a lower case like this. You might be right about the M. <BR>But the z is something
    you can find in the roman this and that way, but I might have to decide to do
    upper and lower case in the same way. The different stresses are only in the italics.

    Zwo</a> and many of your other faces.\r\n\r\nI think Talk (is that the name?)
    has a lot of potential, if for no other reason than modern faces with ultra-distinctive
    forms are very much in demand. I believe <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.10269.3.11&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=look+dad%2C+no+feet&sampleSize=32\">FF
    Dax</a>'s simplified 'n', 'a', 'b', and 'd' often sell the face by themselves.\r\n\r\nSome
    thoughts:\r\n<ul type=\"circle\"><li>The crazy 'S' terminals feel a tad too heavy.</li><li>The
    serifs may be too large, especially noticeable on the 'm'.</li><li>Your 'a', 'k',
    and 'g' are stunning.</li></ul>"
