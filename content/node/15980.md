  seemed worth it this time. \r\n\r\nFor those of you who don't want to pay for Ecto
  -- I did and really like it -- check out <a href=\"http://www.flock.com/\">Flock</a>.
  It has -- among its plentiful promises of playtime -- a blogging tool. Yipee!\r\n"

    features bugged up my link. Quel Bizarre! Speaking of bizarre, that picture of
    me is very scary.\r\n\r\nFlock could be where browsers are headed. It is really
    slow on my machine at work, but then again I'm running on an antique 400MHz."

    told that the memberships are not on since version 2.0 and never heard anything
    else. \r\n\r\nThen my membership date was reset to 0. so it is actually incorrect.
    why can you lot blog? "
