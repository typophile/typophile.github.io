  are known classics of course. Please let me know what you think, maybe you can come
  up some better matches. And perhaps you have some ideas for newer fonts? I'm curious!\r\n\r\n-
  Akzidenz Grotesk / New Baskerville\r\n- Avenir / Didot\r\n- Franklin Gothic / Century\r\n-
  Frutiger / Melior\r\n- Gill Sans / Perpetua / Joanna\r\n- Optima / Palatino\r\n-
  Syntax / Sabon\r\n- Univers / Centennial\r\n- Johnston / Golden Cockerel\r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress/|infraordinaire]]"
