<p>I changed the name of my salon after my business partner left. It was Nails, Etc and I changed it to Scottsdale Hair &amp; Nails - because now we do hair and hair people don&rsquo;t want to be &ldquo;etc&rdquo;.
THEN the city made me add Downtown to it. So it&rsquo;s downtown scottsdale Hair &amp; Nails.
I&rsquo;ve had three logos created. One by a paid &ldquo;professional&rdquo;, one by me and one by a sign guy. They both were totally vanilla. Plus- I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing - clients say &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; and to them I say &ldquo;get out!&rdquo; (the sign guy used orange on a dark window - you can only see it if you&rsquo;re wearing glasses and standing right in front of it.</p>
<p>I spent two days trying to pick out a font and I give up. The best thing I came up with was using the ampersand from microgramma from masterfont. sad huh? See! 
I&rsquo;m not even looking for a logo so much as a decent font that will be visible from more than 10 feet away. Something that doesn&rsquo;t look generic.</p>
<p>Am I asking for too much? Tell me if I am. I even have photos of the salon so you can get an idea of what it&rsquo;s like.

(no log in necessary, just click to view)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s modern and a little industrial- zen-ish. My biggest concern is not having a font that looks oriental because so many people associate it with discount salons.</p>
<p>Is anyone interested? If not, would you refer me to someone?</p>
<p>Thank you so much.

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to post a link from imageshack but I&rsquo;m having a hard time figuring it out&hellip;</p>
<p>I like the look of washington square NF, however it&rsquo;s not ideal for window signs. I think I like the tall d&rsquo;s and l&rsquo;s. It reminds me a little of old hollywood.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>one more comment from me&hellip;I just want to say that I read the post about the band logo and I was hesitant to ask. I was just frustrated with the lack of creativity from well, myself and the two other people I used.</p>
<p>Having been through a nightmare paying for a logo and then having my sign guy/wannabe graphic designer install yuck on my windows. I understand the value in having something that I like and that works.</p>
<p>The problem is- how does a person really know what they&rsquo;re getting? You can see portfolios online and see the sign/logos they&rsquo;ve created but honestly - you can still be buggered!</p>
<p>When I found this board I looked at the critiques of logos and thought  &ldquo;The people here are passionate about their work - they probably see print anywhere and know the font!&rdquo;  I thought it would be a good place to get great ideas or at least referrals for great ideas&hellip;but never for free.</p>
<p>fyi- You can&rsquo;t believe how many times an old man has walked in to my salon with thick toenails the color of a schoolbus and said &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you just cut my toenails?&rdquo; and expected it for free.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Deanna, you should tell what kind of customers you want. If there’s already another salon, then it might be good for you to focus on a different group of customers. Or go straight ahead to compete them, if you now you can do it better.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is only after you tell us what kind of customers you want and what kind of image you want to give them that someone can design an identity for you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for responding medivh and Grot Esque. Someone from here contacted me and I&rsquo;ve forwarded my information to him. Medivh-I&rsquo;ll keep your contact info just in case he changes his mind.</p>
<p>Grot Esque- other salon? It&rsquo;s a sea of salons here in Scottsdale. My salon is an existing salon. I&rsquo;ve had it since 1992. I&rsquo;m just revamping, remodeling and rebranding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s modern and a little industrial- zen-ish. My biggest concern is not having a font that looks oriental because so many people associate it with discount salons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in conveying the same for my logo. Clean lines, relaxed atmosphere. I have a full clientelle so I never thought of what sort of clients to attract. I&rsquo;m interested in attracting booth renters so my hair stations are full. Good question. I haven&rsquo;t been asked that before.
Probably the reason I haven&rsquo;t been happy with a logo.</p>
