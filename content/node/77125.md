body: "Dear Sir or Madam,\r\n\r\nI recently joined a polo club, and we have decided
  to create business cards which we can handout during events. Since appearance plays
  a large role at such events I really want to put some effort into creating great
  looking business cards. Currently I am considering using some decadent colored paper.
  I have also looked into using [[http://www.drukkerijdouma.nl/diensten/foliedruk/|gold]]
  or [[http://www.packvision.nl/NL/Folies/Parelmoer_Folies/|pearl]] lettering. To
  top it off i might want to use [[http://creativebits.org/files/126895462_d86b4b5425.jpg|gold
  edging]], not sure about that though.\r\n\r\nSince this seems to be the place where
  typophiles hang around I am open for suggestions on fonts. Can anyone recommend
  some free fonts which would create a classier look? I browsed the forums and saw
  some very nice fonts, such as the Diamond font from http://www.orangeitalic.com/
  but 299$ is too exotic for me!\r\n\r\nHere is what I created so far:\r\n(still has
  the bleed margins or something)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/polocard_mini_3883.jpg]"

    and I am very busy with my studies and cant afford to drop by your London office

    cards. Do you have any further suggestions on the font or other ideas?\r\n\r\nde

    techniques, but then you want a free font.\r\nQuality applies to printing as it
    applies to typeface design.\r\nAnyway, about the design: your letters and words
    are too crowded. Nothing says \"class\" as a good use of whitespace."

    free offer. You can only spend money once so I always try to spend it wisely.

    it with lower-budget projects where someone wants the general look of embossing
    or engraving but can't afford the real thing.\r\n\r\nI agree with Riccard0 that
    the type (especially the larger type) looks crowded. \r\n\r\nRegarding fonts,
    what fonts are used in your current signage, stationery, etc?  Normally you'd
    want your card to use the same fonts, unless you plan on re-doing those other
    items to match."

    quality fonts than to put your money into unusual and expensive printing processes.
    If the thing you're printing isn't top quality, using a pricey printing method
    isn't going to make it look better. Of course, this is just my opinion \u2014
    but I think it's something to consider.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "If you intend to keep the same all-caps formatting, I might suggest letterspaced
    caps in one of the following:\r\n\r\nAdobe Garamond (which I think has special
    display caps, at least in some versions, and a very nice italic)\r\nTrajan (famously
    overused and often misused, but may be appropriate and effective here)\r\nPerpetua
    Titling (looks similar to what you have)\r\nWaters Titling (gorgeous)\r\nBrioso
    Pro (for a little more personality)\r\n\r\nNote that at least the first two faces
    mentioned above come free with InDesign, and maybe other Adobe software, so depending
    what program you're using, you may have them already.\r\n\r\nUsing small caps
    for the smaller text underneath the name, with oldstyle figures, will add a classier
    look. It looks like you may already have true small caps, but the osf will help.
    Letterspace everything more than feels necessary: for the name, you might start
    with 200 \"units\" (1000/em) = 20%.\r\n\r\nAlso, I sometimes find that using large
    small caps can be better than full caps in this kind of situation, as they're
    wider and seem to have a stronger stance. (I would use the small caps from the
    next optical size up, ideally.)\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. \r\n\r\nJosh"

    so it would have the same length of the name above.

    through our shop who thought otherwise. I have one word for you: letterpress.
    Some classy letters punched so deep into a luxurious, thick paper that you can
    feel the valleys... Mmm...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bisonbookbinding.com/portfolio.php\">Something
    like this</a>. In particular, check out the third card over, but don't go square
    like that one. I say, stick with standard-size business cards. "

  body: 'I think fine letterpress results are had when the paper stock is not too
    heavy, and the bonk is subtle. A heavy bonk, to me, looks as unrefined as thermography.
    The message of the design becomes subservient to its main message: ''I just wanted
    you to know first and foremost that this is letterpress!'' '

    strikes me as this being a case where the level of advice being asked for here
    is borderline something I would normally charge a consulting fee over. No offense
    meant though, but designers' knowledge is a valuable commodity.

    for font suggestions, which is a pretty common question here. \r\n\r\nTo me it's
    like someone sitting next to you on the bus asking for some quick advice. It's
    not the same thing as taking someone on as a client. But I certainly agree that
    design advice has value.\r\n\r\n  "

  body: In regards to this issue (and I am also new here), I usually assume that the
    person asking for advice is the designer in regards to the specific project. For
    instance, even if the original poster of this thread is not a professional graphic
    designer, he is the designer as far as this project is concerned, and I don't
    personally have a problem sharing insights and ideas among designers. If contributors
    started actually redesigning the business card or posting comp images and so on,
    I think I would agree with typenazi.
