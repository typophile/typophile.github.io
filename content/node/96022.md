  to tell you about, as usual, plus a look at some items that arrived in the post.\r\n\r\nThis
  month's \"extra footage\" is of the Bradford Jowett van, a British van (from Yorkshire)
  that was produced between 1946 and 1953. Find out what \"extras\" an additional
  \xA338 for the Deluxe version would have bought you in those days!\r\n\r\nClick
  here to take a look at this month\u2019s video:\r\nhttp://www.metaltype.co.uk/rail/clicks/click.php?id=17\r\n\r\nSome
  of you may know that I've been working on an ebook called \"Printers' Tales\" that
  I'm hoping to make available on the Amazon Kindle in the very near future. The idea
  is to give some of the stories from the website a more permanent home, and, hopefully,
  take them to a wider audience.\r\n\r\nClick the link below to see a list of contributors
  to the ebook. All authors have given their permission for their articles to appear
  on the Metal Type website, please let me know if you don't want your article/s to
  appear in the ebook. Contributors will, of course, receive a free copy of the ebook:\r\nhttp://www.metaltype.co.uk/rail/clicks/click.php?id=12\r\n\r\nI'm
  also looking for help in choosing a cover for the ebook. I've posted several candidates
  and you can vote for your favourite (there is no need to register, etc.). Bear in
  mind that they need to look good, both as a small thumbnail, and full-size. Click
  the link below to vote:\r\nhttp://www.metaltype.co.uk/rail/clicks/click.php?id=18\r\n\r\nStill

  body: "David,\r\n\r\nThanks for your efforts to preserve the pre-digital heritage
    of type. Have you considered special promotional pricing for the academic market?
    Scholarly works like this would make a great adjunct to the academic distribution
    package I am currently developing for my new iLUVfonts line, which would encourage
    students to develop specimen sheets for various typefaces, as \"payment\" for
    cheap access to the entire type library. PDFs of some great old specimen books
    are already available on the internet, and I have a limited number of the \"real
    things\" to add to a lending library.\u2014although my humble collection can't
    come near Stephen Saxe's.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must be quite frank about the proposed
    cover designs: none of them sings to me. Personally, I would prefer a clever visual
    take on the concept of \"twenty-six lead soldiers\"\u2026"
