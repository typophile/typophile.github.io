  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In January of 2006, Extensis released it&rsquo;s latest font management product, Suitcase Fusion. Suitcase Fusion combines some of the best features of the Suitcase and Font Reserve products. A 30 day trial version can be downloaded at:
<a href="http://www.extensis.com">http://www.extensis.com</a></p>
<p>Suitcase is a font management program for Mac OS and Microsoft Windows. Many users of graphic design tools have so many fonts that they cannot keep them active at once in the system. A large number of active fonts may degrade application performance as well as make it difficult to find fonts.</p>
<p>Suitcase Fusion, released in January of 2006, merges two separate Macintosh font managers previously sold by Extensis. One of the font managers, Font Reserve, was previously sold by Diamondsoft before it was aquired by Extensis. Suitcase Fusion combines the most popular features of both products. For example, Suitcase Fusion retains the straightforward, easy-to-use interface of Suitcase X1. It adds to this a key Font Reserve feature, the Vault. The Vault is a centralized repository for fonts and font metadata. Both Suitcase and Font Reserves can upgrade their databases for Suitcase Fusion.</p>
<p>Suitcase Fusion&rsquo;s vault file located in /Users/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/Library/Application Support/Extensis/Suitcase/.</p>
<p>Another feature taken from Font Reserve is face level activation for Macintosh font suitcases. With most font managers, fonts are activated as a suitcase, which means that all of the variations packaged in a suitcase, turn on at once. This would commonly be the book, italic, bold and bold italic weights, but some families have many more variations. Face level activation makes font conflicts far less likely because only the needed parts of a suitcase can be activated.</p>
<p>Suitcase Fusion also features auto-activation plug-ins for popular design applications. Documents opened will automatically activate the fonts they need. If a user has more than one font with the same Postscript name, Suitcase uses an Extensis-developed technology called FontSense to determine which font was used in the document.</p>
<p>Suitcase works with all fonts that are compatible with a given operating system. On Macintosh systems, this includes PostScript Type 1, TrueType, and OpenType.</p>
<p>Suitcae Fusion is compatible with Mac OS 10.3.9 and later.</p>
