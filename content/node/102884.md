  I open the font in Volt, I get this message that \"OTL tables already exist, and
  Volt will delete the OTL table\". \r\nI actually need the OTL table of that font.
  How do I do that?\r\n\r\nActually some of the lookups of that font is not working
  so I would like to extract the lookup table of that font, edit it and save it back.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nShahid"

  body: "You can't do that with VOLT. VOLT does not decompile OTL tables, only write
    them.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any tools that will flawlessly decompile OTL tables
    in a way that a) ensures they can be recompiled and b) it identical to the original
    source from which they were made. The success of decompiling OTL tables in e.g.
    FontLab Studio 5 will depend on the contents of those tables, whether they can
    be handled with the version of the ADFKO code that FontLab uses, etc.. You might
    be able to use a program like FontLab to decompile into AFDKO syntax, then save
    that as a .fea file, edit it in text editor, and then use AFDKO itself or DTL
    OTMaster to try to compile the edited OTL features."

    \ new to fonts, I will need your support in future also.\r\n\r\nBy the way which
    font have you used for your name in Urdu? Its beautiful. The font I am talking
    about in the above post is an Arabic Font by the way.\r\n\r\nIf I start afresh
    with the font in VOLT, how do I access private data area of the font as I see
    that there are certain glyphs in private area.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards.\r\n\r\nShahid"

    try again.\r\n\r\nI am stuck again."

    problem as the latest release of FontLab does not have this restriction:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/fontlab-studio-specifications/\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>Imports</strong>
    fonts with up to 65,535 glyphs</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><strong>Exports</strong>
    fonts with up to 65,535 glyphs</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat program(s) did you use
    to create the font?"

    I have uninstalled it right away. I am using Fontforge now. The font which I am
    using is QuranPublisher. There are certain combinations not working which I need
    to correct.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help JanekZ. I have made some corrections to
    the font and it works. I have now discovered that there are many other lookup
    issues which needs to be corrected. I am doing that and learning to use fontforge
    too.\r\n\r\nI have one query. Is it possible to save the lookup data in MS VOLT
    format and do the lookups in VOLT. \r\n\r\nIs there any way to print a list of
    glyphs with its Unicode name, ID etc in excel format too. Just for reference sake.\r\n\r\nIs
    there step by step method to develop fonts in fontforge? Any other Freeware.\r\n\r\nThanks
    and regards,\r\nShahid"
