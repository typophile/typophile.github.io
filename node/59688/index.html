  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Type Folk,

I know someone here has a succinct answer to this question. Please lend your expertise.

A designer I work with has a project that is set in multiple languages. She's using InDesign on a Macintosh, and has set all of the Chinese in the System font STHeiti. It's license does not permit the font being embedded into a PDF, which is how the job will go to press. She made some inquires, but did not make much headway in finding a substitute that could be embedded.

To publish the document as a PDF requires turning the font to outline, which if you only had to do it once would be no big deal, but it hampers sending files out to the end client and translators for corrections. And it jumps the file size.

Does anyone know of a similar font that can be purchased in the US, preferably over the Internet at an English language website? Or is this a fact-of-life with double-bit Chinese fonts that we're just going to have to live with?

Is your designer friend using Mac or PC? Is she using the original Adobe software? If you are using any Mac machine with original Adobe softwares you shouldn't have such problem, because logically speaking, any system font came along with Mac OS would be covered by the licensing.

A lot of designers in developing countries (including those in mine) like to install Mac OS in PC and use pirated softwares. Once you do that, you would have a lot of problems.

I work on a Macintosh, and so does the designer who has the font issue. I don't know if she's running Tiger or Leopard, we're a few hundred miles apart, and I don't generally do house calls.
 
That might work Michel. I opened AdobeHeitiStd-Regular.otf  and Apple's STHeiti.ttf in FontLab, and although I see Adobe's version has a somewhat smaller glyph count, it has "Editing of the document allowed" which should allow it to be saved into the PDF. Bravo.

One would think that Weng. The font software is licensed to Apple and supplied with the System install disk,  I can open it in FontLab and see that it's from Changzhou SinoType Technology Co., Ltd. and that "Embedding of this font is not allowed." That is where our problem resides. I think substituting AdobeHeitiStd might resolve the issue, IF all the glyphs used are present. If memory serves, when we were using MacOS 9, there was also a "simplified" version of the supplied Chinese font that had a reduced glyph set.

Makes design more complicated when you're not fluent in the language.

Thanks again, I'm going to try a font substitution and see if the line endings change.

		<div class="commentbody">I don’t know Michel. It should allow subsetting. Up until this morning, I had not tried saving text set in STHeiti as a PDF. I copied an article written in Chinese this morning from worldjournal.com into TextEdit, changed the font to STHeiti and saved it as a PDF. It worked fine, no issues. I tried it using the same text in InDesign, and got this error message. "This font could not be embedded due to restrictions in the font file. The font must be installed to view or print this file properly with Adobe Acrobat. View additional errors?" 

Since we're working in a Mac and PC environ, it's not a given that the client or the translators will have that font installed. I believe the final form will be posted as a PDF on the Internet, as well as being printed.

Thank you for the pointer Kentlew, after checking into this further, I will contact Ken directly if I cannot resolve this.

I tried a step further: I went on the <a href="http://www4.bmo.com/chinese/">Bank of Montreal Chinese homepage</a>, selected Traditional Chinese, copied some text there, pasted it in InDesign with STHeiti selected, exported the text as pdf (without STHeiti being embedded), and copied the resulting pdf file <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/STHeitiTrial.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>; I then tried to read it from my PC using Internet explorer. Internet explorer (in fact some Adobe plugin) complained that a resource was missing, went to fetch the missing font and could eventually display the text.

My guess is that if you use Adobe applications to access the pdf file, the font STHeiti will be properly displayed even if it is not embedded  (provided the application accessing the file can connect to the internet to get the missing resource).

That probably is true Michel. The place it's likely to fail is at press, and it could potentially be an expensive fix. Remember the bad ol' days when PostScript printers would set Courier when a font could not be located? That sort of thing still happens. Think your solution of using AdobeHeitiStd instead of Apple’s version, STHeiti, is going to be the ticket, ...if the brochure text doesn’t use one or more of the 2,200 odd glyphs that are not mutually shared.

Substituting the fonts as you did was the right solution. The OS/2.type value of STHeiti.ttf is set to 2, which explicitly denies embedding. The value in AdobeHeitiStd-Regular.otf is set to 8, which allows embedding.

		<div class="commentbody">This is generally not too surprising. Historically there were a bunch of Mac system fonts set to "no embedding." My impression is that some of them have been changed to allow embedding in more recent versions of Mac OS.

There's a valid question as to why Apple or their vendor set the font to "no embedding" in the first place. There's an even better question as to why creating a PDF at the system level would embed such a font.

I'd say InDesign is behaving as it ought to from what we know of the situation. Luckily you've found a good substitute font. IIRC, Heiti was produced by a sort of consortium and there are lots of different vendors' versions of what is basically the same design.

I wonder if InDesign could not do it in a more user friendly fashion. If Acrobat Professional or Acrobat Reader use AdobeHeitiStd-Regular to display pdf files for which STHeiti has not been embedded (that's what I deduce from the fact that Adobe Reader installed that font in its <code>Contents/MacOS/Resource/CIDFont</code> resource folder when I tried to view the pdf file for which STHeiti had not been embedded), why would InDesign not propose users that same substitution when exporting? Why are the resources available to Acrobat not available to InDesign? That would have saved time to Bill since he eventually did exactly that substitution. Of course, I would never propose that InDesign do a substitution without asking the user.

		<div class="commentbody">This is timely, I'm having the same problem with STHeiti in exported pdfs (ID CS2 / OSX 10.4.11).

From what I can see from my client's scans, STHeiti automatically gets substituted with Hei on their PCs, with missing glyphs.

Looks like getting my hands on AdobeHeitiStd-Regular.otf might be the only solution?

<cite>Posted by Michel Boyer 6.Jul.2009 4.10pm:
On my Adobe CS3 installation DVDs, there is a folder Goodies/Fonts containing in particular a font called AdobeHeitiStd-Regular.otf
</cite>

Before I ask my boss to look for the CS2 installation DVD (we can't find it in the studio, I'm guessing she might have it at home), is anyone able to confirm if the same advice applies to CS2?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Michel asked: <cite>If Acrobat Professional or Acrobat Reader use AdobeHeitiStd-Regular to display pdf files for which STHeiti has not been embedded (that’s what I deduce from the fact that Adobe Reader installed that font in its Contents/MacOS/Resource/CIDFont resource folder when I tried to view the pdf file for which STHeiti had not been embedded), why would InDesign not propose users that same substitution when exporting? Why are the resources available to Acrobat not available to InDesign? That would have saved time to Bill since he eventually did exactly that substitution. Of course, I would never propose that InDesign do a substitution without asking the user.</cite>

I think you're making a few tacit assumptions, and missing some information.

If Acrobat/Reader needs a Japanese or Chinese font for substitution, and you don't have the East Asian language support for Reader installed, it will offer to download it. Acrobat/Reader uses Adobe Heiti to substitute for just about *any* Chinese font not embedded in the PDF. The fact that in your case it *happened* to be another version of Heiti was just a happy coincidence.


Not knowing that it's a similar font, there's no particular reason that InDesign would choose to substitute it on export. And for that matter, why embed the generic substitution font, when anybody viewing that document will get that font anyway? It would be like embedding Adobe Sans in a PDF.

I was missing information indeed.  I thought that a user that would be asked if he wants his nice font to be replaced by Abobe Sans would click on "No". What are the fonts with <code>fsType AND 0x0002</code> equal to <code>TRUE</code> that a professional using InDesign is likely to have to live with?

[edit 2] If I rely on <a href="http://www.fontembedding.com/local/documents/EULA-embedding.pdf">this document</a> on the font embedding site, only Enschede and Letterhead would have fonts with nothing allowed. To that I guess we need to add some Mac system fonts. What else?</div>

True.

I should have mentioned, if you want to substitute a font in InDesign, just use the "Find Font" mechanism to replace it, before making the PDF. In most other apps you could search and replace the formatting to change the font.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, this discussion was extremely usefgul to me, but I am still having some problems. I started a new thread about it at http://typophile.com/node/71159. Thought you guys might be interested. The original post is below:



Hello fellow typophiles,

I am having a problem embedding chinese fonts on PDF to print and view. This topic has been discussed before on http://typophile.com/node/59688, but I have hit another roadblock and would like to ask if anyone with the same problem found a solution.

I designed a magazine (260+ pages) on InDesign CS3 on a Mac running OS 10.4 in mandarin, using the native mac font STHeiti. When it was time to send the piece to the printers, I discovered that the font was blocked and could not be embedded on a PDF.

In the above mentioned post, I discovered that Adobe has a font (Adobe Heiti) which is identical to STHeiti and can de embedded. But then ran into another problem. In the publication (remember, 260+ pages) I used STHeiti <i>Light</i> and the Adobe mentioned font - at least the one I have in my system which came from my CS3 package - only has a <i>Regular</i> set.

This slight change will force me to redesign most pages, since they are mostly running text.

I also noticed that in Snow Leopard, Apple has changed the native chinese font to a similar Heiti family. Therefore STHeiti no longer exists in the system.

I have 3 questions I hope you can help me with:

1- Do you know of any system upgrades that could allow access to STHeiti Light in a format that can be embbeded?

2- Do you know if Adobe Heiti exists as a <i>Light</i> font and where I can get it?

3- (And this is not really related) How do I substitute STHeiti for Adobe Heiti in 50 separate InDesign documents at once?

Thanks,
Gabriel Attuy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, 
Thanks for those explanation. 
I had the same issue: I'm using STKaiti in an Indesign document. 
I chose this font because it appears as "embeddable" on my MacBook Pro (OS X) font library. 
The thing is: I can't save that document in PDF with this font (I still get the message saying that font is protected)... when I'm switching to STHeiti it works though...
I don't really get why Indesign PDF export tool doesn't behave the same way with those two fonts.
Any clue?
Thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Even if  FontBook says Kaiti is embeddable, the font file itself contains  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#fst">fsType equal to <code>0x0002</code></a> which means, according to the specification on the Microsoft site
<blockquote>
Restricted License embedding:

The hex value <code>0002</code> means exactly that bit 1 and only bit 1 is set. InDesign complies with what is written (without asking if you got permission).

Added: To answer completely your question, I should have added that the fsType of ST Heiti is not the same as that of ST Kaiti.
