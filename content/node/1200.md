  body: ' first. but the figures seem soooo square in comparison to <BR> the nice
    round courners of the letters. the space in  <BR>between the &#39;1&#39; and the
    &#39;4&#39; is a little too much in  <BR>comparison to the space on the outside,
    ergo i would  <BR>make the black box a little bigger and the figs a bit  <BR>smaller
    &#40;or maybe just the box bigger&#41;. in fact, i might  <BR>take them out of
    the black box, it seems to go again the  <BR>letters in the word &#39;flow&#39;.
    or the black box the same  <BR>height as the &#39;flow&#39; and shrink the figs.
    also, maybe  <BR>another issue is the fact the &#39;flow&#39; is in an extended  <BR>typeface,
    but the figs are not? they seem too dissimiliar to  <BR>work? all questions and
    comments and ideas. one thing i  <BR>would not change is &#39;flow&#39;. '

    of &#39;flow&#39;... <BR> <BR>&#40;...maybe because english is not my mother language?&#41;
    <BR> <BR>you could make the horizontal white spaces in the &#39;o&#39; a little
    bit smaller to avoid this... <BR> <BR>gf&#42; '

  body: 'Alright...taking your helpful comments into consideration, I&#39;ve made
    some adjustments and changes to the 14. I&#39;m posting some of the variations
    I came up with and I already have a favorite, but I would still like to hear what
    everyone thinks. <BR> <BR>This process has definitely helped me move in the direction
    I wanted to go. I really liked my original logo, but something didn&#39;t feel
    quite right about it. I think now I&#39;m getting to the stage where I feel it&#39;s
    complete and I won&#39;t have the compulsion to keep making changes...I think
    I&#39;m my own worst client.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback...keep it coming!
