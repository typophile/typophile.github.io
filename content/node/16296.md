body: "Hi typophiles, (or typenerds as my wife calls us),\r\n\r\nThis is my first
  post inviting criticism of my design. \r\n\r\nI'm working on this informal script
  at the moment. I drew it with pen and ink first to get the thick/thin contrast,
  but I didn't want it to look 'Dickensian' - I'm trying to achieve a naturally flowing
  style without formal stiffness. I have completed the 'rough' style, and I thought
  it might look pretty good as a smooth style - so that's what I'm doing now.  I'm
  also going to produce a more refined 'fine' with as-thin-as-I-can-go thins style.\r\n\r\nAt
  the moment it is Postscript, but I'm toying with the idea of contextual alternates
  in Opentype. The FontLab manual is no great help as I find it to be written from
  a programmers viewpoint, unfortunately I'm a designer and a lot of that stuff goes
  way over my head. I wish Leslie Cabarga had written the manual, as his 'Learn FontLab
  Fast' has excellent illustrated step-by-steps, but is a bit brief in the OpenType
  section.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know of any easy to understand intructions of exactly
  what to do, as I'm very impatient with plowing through the manual to extract the
  info.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSee new pdf. 28 November 2006\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

    clean styles. Since it's thicker than a lot of scripts it would be perfect for
    setting logos, and lots of other uses too, of course.\r\n\r\nSorry, I can't help
    you with OpenType, but check out build section for lots of posts on the subject."

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nThis last sample shows how interesting and vital this design
    can be. Please, DO take it to the next logical level and add contextual alternates.
    1, 2 or 3 alternates per letter, plus a bunch of ligatures and final forms would
    make this a really exciting handwriting face. I think the rough version is best.
    \r\n\r\nIf you are not versed in OpenType code, you might want someone to help
    you set that up. It can be confusing, and it definitely requires patience in testing,
    but I think the shapes you have already have terrific promise. \r\n\r\nThis is
    unique in that it seems to be written with a pointed quill dipped in an inkwell.
    Very few script typefaces give that feeling. The 'splat' alternates will be like
    icing. Keep going!"

    Perhaps you could do stylistic sets with increasing amounts of swashes? The swashy

  body: "\"finishing off now, and with a pdf of instructions for use\"\r\n\r\nIf you
    think through the substitutions, alternates and default behavior, and get some
    assistance with the OpenType programming, instructions won't be necessary. You
    can definitely add dozens of alternates and ligatures, because I agree those will
    make this design all the more convincing and fluid, but it's unrealistic to think
    people will carefully select alternates. Wouldn't it really kick kiester to provide
    2 or 3 different \"states\" or conditions? Consider offering stylistic variations
    like Formal, Casual, Feverish, Passionate. You set up the alternates and ligatures
    that create those different effects, and any user can choose which one is suitable
    for their copy, as a simple OpenType feature choice. \r\n\r\nOne reason for this
    is that if you offer all the swash letters as a single option, you get a mess.
    It's likely to never look very good if all the swashes always appear together;
    and as you've already noticed, it really looks cool when you judiciously add a
    few swashes here and there. That would only be possible if you control what happens
    with each user choice. If you want assistance in setting up OT feature code, I
    suggest contacting Tal Leming or the House Industries gang; they have done great
    work setting up automatic substitutions, and I really think this design will be
    fully realized only with a lot of OpenType enhancement. I really like it, and
    I encourage you not to try to finish it too hastily. "
