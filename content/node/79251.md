  1920s (first, he lied about his age to join the US Navy, and served in WWI, and
  then when he got out, he joined the Marines and served in South America). I'm looking
  for typeface suggestions for both headlines and body copy \u2014 something that
  would've been used in America around that time, that would also be appropriate for
  a guy who, with his bare hands, saved a woman from a sword-wielding criminal in
  Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nFranklin Gothic is the only thing that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nWould
  a Clarendon work? I know it's origins are in England, but it seems like it could
  work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "The notion of manliness is problematic, because many of the gentlemanly qualities
    that were appropriate to real men in the 1920s would now be considered effete.
    Russel Crowe did not play Robin Hood in tights, as Errol Flynn did.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    a graphic quality like an adventure book from the 1920s would be good to aim for,
    as you grandfather's story seems to have been one of romantic adventure.\r\n\r\nRockwell
    Kent, although not a navy man, was a sailor and adventurer, his <em>NbyNE</em>

  body: "Thanks for all the input. This is good stuff! I hand't thought about the
    \"romantic adventure\" aspect of what he did. I guess because most of the documents
    of his I have involve swords and explosions and things like that. The adventure
    novel idea certainly has some potential (too bad I'm not an illustrator).\r\n\r\nI
    probably should've been clearer about what it is I'm working on. It's just a personal/family
    project to be printed through blurb.com. It'll be heavy on pictures and scans
    of documents, and fairly minimal in the text department, but some of the adventure
    novel stuff could certainly be woven in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    album (you can find examples via Google), with some period-appropriate fonts.
    Maybe do captions in a handwriting font if they aren't too long. \r\n\r\nAnd at
    iStockPhoto.com if you search for phrases like \"photo album vintage\" you can
    find inexpensive stock art that might be useful (backgrounds that simulate old
    paper, old photo corner mounts, etc.)."
