body: "Hi folks,\r\nI've got q'tion to FontLab and how to use components?\r\n\r\nWhat
  I've done sofar is to make different components like verticals, horizontal edges
  etc. But the thing is that I made several horizontals and I was wondering if it
  is crazy to do so, cause when I add a component I pull and make it longer it that's
  what i want to.\r\n\r\nIs it a good or bad idea to make different lengths and widths
  ... they all have samme thickness.\r\n\r\n"
