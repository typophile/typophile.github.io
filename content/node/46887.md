  thoughts on the ordinal suffixes \"st\", \"nd\", \"rd\", \"th\". I've seen the baseline
  of these suffixes raised. Can anyone talk about this? I can't find it in Chicago
  Manual of Style, or Elements of Typographic Style. Am I looking in the wrong places?
  I just want to hear some conversation about when this raised baseline makes sense
  and when it doesn't."

  body: "Lots of folks recommend against using them in dates, Opting to omit the ordinal
    suffix from the numeral, but spell out the suffix when the date is spelled out
    in letters.\r\n\r\n{ I'm going camping on July 12, and staying outdoors until
    the twentieth. }\r\n\r\nWhich is a style I'm learning to appreciate. Though, that
    doesn't account for other ordinal numbers. I'm looking particularly for information
    about street ordinals."

  body: "In English, this is entirely stylistic. All publishers I know steer clear
    of raised ordinals. It is viewed as archaic and fussy. (Despite MS Word's propensity
    for raising them -- <em>faux</em> raised ordinals, no less.)\r\n\r\nMany OpenType
    fonts are starting to support them regularly with {sups} or {ordn}. But American
    publishers generally don't accept them in regular use.\r\n\r\nThere are other
    languages -- like Spanish, I think -- where raised forms are considered more linguistically
    proper. Thus the inclusion of <em>ordmasculine</em> and <em>ordfeminine</em> in
    standard character sets (but, inexplicably, no accommodation for some plural forms).\r\n\r\n--

    street names\", with the exception that \"the convention for Manhattan addresses
    is to spell out numbers for avenue names and use numbers for street names: <em>the
    corner of Fifth and 59th</em>\". \r\n\r\nWhat Kent said about the stylistic avoidance
    of raised ordinals.\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver
