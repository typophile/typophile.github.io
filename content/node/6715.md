body: 'I need to make a typographic statement for this neophilic question: &#34;Is
  Scarlett &#40;Johansson&#41; the new Marilyn Monroe?&#34;.  I am trying to capture
  some of the speculation how people are hailing this actress the new Marilyn, especially
  as she bares more than a passing resemblance to her: the hair, full lips, curvy
  figure, glamour beyond her 19 years. When she wore a white satin dress to the Bafta
  awards, she was on the cover of many newspapers who put their pictures next to each
  other and made comparisons. <BR>This is not for commercial use, I am a student and
  would appreciate any advice on how to convey this using pure typography and/or images.  I
  am just finding it difficult to start, and even though these designs wont be sold,
  I also feel wary about using existing photos of Marilyn &#40;copyrights etc&#41;.
  The design will be screenprinted onto a large tea towel so any imagery I would use
  of Scarlett/Marilyn I would want to be 2 colours max, but iconic enough - her lips
  or a Warhol type print of her face/ use of silhouettes.  I have been looking at
  her movie posters but don&#39;t merely want to rip one off.  I do want to include
  some of that vintage Hollywood glamour, but also the question of whether Scarlett
  is the our answer to Marilyn for 2004?!   <BR>There is the idea of clones and today&#39;s
  stars styling themselves as the older Hollywood legends - to increase their status
  perhaps?  <BR> <BR>I could also do the statement &#34;Puppies are the new babies&#34;
  - using type or image.  I am referring to the trend of mainly celebrities using
  puppies as the latest A-list accessory, think Paris Hilton, Legally Blonde.  I would
  appreciate any thoughts or advice that might help, as it would be interesting to
  see how typographers would approach this brief. ..'

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;hmmm... scarlett the new marilyn?
    i dunno about that. mostly cuz i don&#39;t know that much about marilyn. i DO
    know scarlett is very sexy, tho! I saw her in the new ad campaign for Eternity
    Moment this weekend and had to have more so i went and rented The Girl with the
    Pearl Earring. &#40;i guess she did look very marilyn in that ad!&#41; I did like
    the type in the Eternity commericals. It seemed to be a very tall, skinny version
    of Optima??? If you like kitschy <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/ribbon-131/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=72&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Marilyn+Monroe"
    target="_blank">Ribbon</a> also called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/ribbon-131/morelikethis.html"
    target="_blank">Coronet</a> came to mind when i was thinking of how to capture
    Marilyn Monroe. <BR>Anyhow here&#39;s a bit of imagry &#40;with type included&#41;
    for ya... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/49362.jpg"

  body: I think the &#39;Eternity Moment&#39; is a variant of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/radiant-extra-condensed-ct/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=72&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=ETERNITY"
    target="_blank">Radiant</a>, which is older than Optima, and probably more likely
    to be seen in the 50&#39;s.

  body: nice. very close, would just about be it if you moved the bars of the E&#39;s
    up just a bit and made the bowl of the R a bit smaller. What&#39;s the term for
    what i&#39;m trying to say? &#40;I almost wanna say &#34;stance&#34; but i know
    i&#39;m just makin that up!&#41;

  body: Hmm, could also be based on <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/britannic/"
    target="_blank">Britannic</a>, which is even earlier, 1901. If you want a positive
    ID try the wizards at the type ID board. I am guessing because it is a logo they
    have taken some version of Britannic or Radiant and modified it.  <BR> <BR>Optima,
    which I think is great, adds subtle flairs to the Britannica/Radiant precursors.

  body: By the way, in relation to the interest of Cheryl, the aura of the girl in
    the picture, who is incredibly beautiful, is different from MM. Marilyn Monroe
    would usually look right at the camera, trying to seduce every man and boy on
    the other side, and succeeding. Scarlett, if that is her name, is not innocent
    looking, but compared to Marilyn, she is.

  body: Oh well done for the Eternity fonts. I love those ads, I wish I could download
    it somewhere! <BR> <BR>The design will be screen printed onto a tea towel &#40;cotton&#41;
    so do you think the fonts recommended will look eye catching enough, or should
    I buy a bolder font?  Just asking before I go buying fonts blindly :D I bought
    &#34;Murray Hill&#34; though. <BR> <BR>It is interesting reading your opinions
    - most people don&#39;t think she is &#34;the new Marilyn&#34; as such - well
    she is impossible to replace.  I might design it as &#34;IS she the new Marilyn?&#34;
    rather than saying &#34;SHE IS!!!&#34; haha.  At the moment I am not sure what
    to write without making it so obvious, you know?   <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help.

    Just because she is blonde, an actress and is the same gender, journos find it
    easy to pigeonhole her. So perhaps your answer to the question should be a resounding '
