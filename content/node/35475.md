  other day was stuck with the simple elegance of a recent redesign. Note the new
  type selection for the word \"classic\". Tasty.\r\n\r\nThe production designer in
  charge of adding fake water droplets to the print files must be out sick. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coke_b4after_3541.jpg]\r\n\r\nBrand

    the images of water droplets with actual water droplets. Slowly but surely making
    their way out of the Cave. ;)\r\n\r\nI really like the redesign. The only thing
    that could make it better in my opinion is the removal of the word \"classic\".
    But I'm quite happy as it is."

    Coke account that part of beverage sales strategy is to make a visual brand update
    every 6 months or so to keep us consumers thinking there's something new to buy!\r\n\r\nPepsi
    has done the same going to an all blue can with white lettering in the last year
    . . .\r\n\r\nBTW, the reason all the 2-liter bottles sit on top of the beverage
    aisle is because they are least profitable to the soda companes compared to what
    we pay for 6, 12, and 24 packs . . .\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

    a real improvement, too. I wonder if Coke and Pepsi buyers really care about the
    constant rebranding or if it really impacts sales. Sounds like a money-maker for
    the marketing firm to me.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "To me they just look like old coke cans that must have been sitting in a
    basement since 1970. And Gotham just looks really out of place next to the wild
    swashy type. It feels like they\u2019re just trying to make the fake-retro trend
    work for them, but doing the job by committee. \r\n\r\n<cite>I wonder if Coke
    and Pepsi buyers really care about the constant rebranding or if it really impacts
    sales.</cite>\r\n\r\nI read an article a few years ago that said Coke does so
    much marketing it\u2019s next to impossible for them to guage the success of most
    of their efforts, so they just keep shifting money around and changing their methods
    to keep anybody from getting used to anything. Coke will drop a campaign if there\u2019s
    a lot of public griping, such as with the insane degree of product placement in
    the second season of American Idol."

    2 was taken off the market. I expect it will disappear completely within the next
    three design iterations.\r\n\r\nI read reports once that Coke might be sold in
    curvey cans to mimic the old glass bottles, similar to the Sapporo beer tall cans.
    I have never seen them on the market, though."

    route with Lemon.\r\n\r\nMe - I have officially given up Coca-Cola -- it really
    hurts in the acid reflux department. The caffeine in other sodas is okay - there
    is something in Coca-Cola that burns up my system inside out. It hurts... \r\n\r\nBTW
    - I have always been a big Coke fan. Even my wedding pictures show hubby and me
    in a horse and buggy, on the back it saied \"Just Married\" and we are pulling
    lots of Coca-Cola cans. (Right across 5th Avenue!)"
