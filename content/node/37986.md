  Fontshop.com has removed the redirect on their website to a deeper level of the
  site. So linking to the font won't bug the international users anymore. \r\n\r\nGreat
  work, people, thanks. \r\n\r\nThis is what Stewf wrote to <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typoforum/viewtopic.php?p=32551#32551\">Ralf
  Hermann</a>:\r\n\r\n<em>Ralf, I'm pleased to say we've integrated new FontShop redirection
  behavior. You can now visit FontShop.com without being redirected until you want
  to purchase. I hope you like the change.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Yes, we do!</strong>"
