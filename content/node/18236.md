  body: I ask the date because this looks pre-digital. Also similar are <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FB.613.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=MAMA+WE+KNOW&sampleSize=48">Bureau

  body: If you try Railroad Gothic out in Veer's Flont (online type tester) you'll
    see that, except for the crossbar on the A, it's quite close. (FontShop carries
    Linotype's version, but it's more different than the Red Rooster version.)

  body: "Hello again and thanks everybody, I will continue with the project with Railroad
    Gothic, it\xB4s so damn close to the original. Bureau Grotesque a good option
    too. \r\n\r\nThe original was made sometimes 99\xB4and is a part of big (about
    2x2 m) painting, I have a picture of it wich I\xB4m using as artwork for an album
    cover. Wich explains why I needed the original typeface. So once again, thank
    you for your help and the fast replys. I\xB4ll promise to post the cover as soon
    as it\xB4s finished. \r\n\r\nDamn it\xB4s cold here in Finland, forget Siberia.
    BRRRR!!!"
