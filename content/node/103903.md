    Manual</a>. As they are talking about the main typography (but not the logotype)
    I assume it is done especially for the logo. \r\n\r\nThe main typography uses
    Signika and Verdana. "

    the wyd, that's why I'm looking for the font.\r\nBut I guess I'll just work with
    similar ones; as there's only 3 letters in the logo I'm pretty sure it will be
    hard to tell the difference.\r\n\r\nif anybody knows the logo-font, I'd appreciate
    any hint!"

    it could be a custom job. \r\nMy 2 cent now. Why not simply following official
    branding guidelines Renko linked to? You could even extract official logo as vector
    from the PDF, use it for the sweater design and complete the lettering using their
    official main font Signika (freely available to download [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/signika|here]])
    as it is clearly specified on guidelines. Easy job, clean and consistent with
    WYD identity."

    official guidelines for the design of the sweater. and I really like the look
    and I don't miss the WYD-font at all.\r\n\r\n@hrant: sorry for the grave accent:
    I was typing on a computer with a swiss keyboard which I'm not used to. and to
    me it seems swiss keyboards have all kinds of accents all over everywhere. hard
    to avoid them..."
