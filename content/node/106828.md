  body: "Two different slab serif fonts. Note the E of El Dia has a bar at the end
    of the center stroke while the E of El Plata does not.\r\nEl Plata is a newspaper
    letterhead, presumably older than digital fonts. I expect it has special details.
    Note for example the special serifs on A, where the inside is lower than the outside.\r\nAs
    for digital equivalents to the basic letters, one option is Geometric Slabserif
    703 ExtraBold Condensed from Tilde:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GeometricSlabserif703ExtraBoldCondensedTildeInUse_6475.gif]\r\nThe
    bowl on P is more squared than the P in EL PLATA, but otherwise it is pretty close.
    Memphis has a more rounded bowl for P but there are other differences. Same for
    Karnak.\r\nDon"
