  brush stroke style fonts/logos. such as the specialized logo.\r\n\r\n is there a
  graphic term for this type of fake handmade look, or the fact that they purposefully
  stylize errors, imperfections etc?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specialized_logo_4289.jpg]"

    brush strokes etc.  like drips and waves or logos that incorporated a line that
    was falsely \"hand drawn\"\r\n\r\nany info, writings, or resources regarding this
    would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n"
