  body: "uh................not feeling it at all. \r\nThe colors are...well you probably
    dont want the color of \"crap\" for an underwear. Think fresh. Think spring. So
    pink or yellows... And the \"Julia\" typestyle is way off for the subject matter.
    the \"teen\" is good, but still could use work.\r\n\r\nYou probably will have
    to hand-draw this sucker."

    the Village <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com\">script</a> is pretty fresh\u2026"
