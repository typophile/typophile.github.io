  man John Graham (1851-?) originally worked in a printing office and later went to
  work for [[MacKellar Smiths and Jordan|MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan]] type foundry
  working on specimen books. At night he studied drawing and letter design, and bought
  engraving tools and taught himself type cutting. The foundry encouraged his efforts
  and in 1882 he joined the [[Marder Luse Foundry]] in Chicago where he cut Spinner
  Script and Spinner Script No. 2, and some sizes of Inclined Program. He cut a minion
  size map font for the Illinois Type Foundry, and eventually started the Graham type
  foundry, primarily cutting borders and ornaments, which were highly successful. "
