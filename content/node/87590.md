body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nAs I was putting the finishing touches on this font I noticed it
  was displaying differently between Fontlab Studio 5's metrics window and InDesign.
  In the image below the first type samples are from InDesign, with a screengrab from
  Fontlab pasted beneath to show how the font appears in it's metrics window. The
  yellow dots indicate the frustrating bits.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/y4uBroken_6133.gif]\r\n\r\nI'm
  stumped, this is my first font and I have been teaching myself the application as
  I go, any ideas? Assistance devoid of unfamiliar terminology will could most valuable.
  ;D\r\n\r\nTwo things which might be relevant - first, being unsure of all the kerning
  rules (and slightly masochistic) I kerned the font character by character. There
  are a lot of rules. Thousands. Also, when generating the font I noticed Binary was
  giving me a Stack error, so I used the Compiled option.\r\n\r\nAdditional info on
  the font's design is available here: \r\nhttp://www.behance.net/gallery/Broken-Straights-%28font%29/808686\r\n\r\nCriticism
  welcomed. \r\n\r\nThanx\r\n\r\n"

  body: Do you have a kern OT feature? Different kerning values in metrics table and
    kern feature may cause problems. Also verify if InDesign is using metrics instead
    of optical kerning method.

  body: "It seems like you don't have the kern OT feature.\r\n\r\nProbably I am wrong,
    but first you should delete all kerning and organize it in groups.\r\nYour W,H,D,1,6,!
    seem to have the common left side. 3,5,6,8 seem to have the same right side. You
    have overkerned the HU (and maybe AR) already, so it would be easier to fix such
    problems making all once again, but in more sufficient way.\r\n"

  body: "Those guys are talking about an old version of a different program (Fontographer).
    \r\n\r\nHave you tried reading the \"Editing Metrics\" section of the FontLab
    manual? Everything you need to know about spacing fonts is there. Just a guess,
    but it seems like you're trying to learn FontLab without reading the manual. You
    really kind of need to do that if you value your time and sanity. (Apologies if
    you have read it. Also, apologies to those who have read it and <em>have</em>
    gone insane.) \r\n\r\nAlso, you seem to be trying to control the spacing almost
    entirely with kerning. That's not how it's supposed to work and you'll go crazy
    trying to do it like that. "

  body: "Definetly, Broke. You seem to use kerning instead of metrics. Use kerning
    to solve problems that cannot be fixed with metrics, not to fix the metrics.\r\nAnyway,
    learn about the metrics groups and kern classes."

  body: "Will do. Already kerned all the pairs tho. All of em. Even the special characters.
    aaa aba aca ada right up to the umlauts, all that. Kern classes are for poussies
    - the font looks dope... in the metrics window at least.\r\n\r\nSoo - there's
    no switch I can flick to get what I'm looking at in the FontLab metrics window
    to come out the same on the other end then? Snap. Spent a few minutes on this
    thing now. InDesign isn't set to optical, and everything previews great except
    for a few pieces of punctuation and the gap after the A, which is a major. \r\n\r\nThere
    is no overkerning in this glyph-set froo, it's all about choosing the spots where
    they actually get to touch. ;) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
