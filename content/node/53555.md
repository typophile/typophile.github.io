  body: "It looks like Karl-Erik Forsberg's HANDiwork but I cannot locate his books
    in the mess. You might want to take a look at Sigvar by Arthur Baker as a substitute.\r\n\r\nIs
    this a new book?\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I was also thinking of Forsberg when I saw the sample but can't find any match.
    I have a book at home with som samples of Karl-Erik's work. I'll have a look tonight.
    You can also look at som more similar fonts as <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/michelangelo-bq/">Michelangelo</a>,
    <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/stockholm/">Stockholm</a> (looks like
    Forsbergs Carolus) and maybe <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/diotima/">Diotima</a>...

    though : )\r\n\r\nIf it is an relatively newer book it may be Kerstin Anckers.\r\n\r\nJust
    guesses!\r\n\r\nMichael"

    loosely) on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/arthurbaker/baker-signet/|Baker Signet]],
    but I agree Baker Signet is a close alternative.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It doesn't have to be an exact match, in fact it's more interesting if it
    is a near miss!\r\n\r\nIt's an album cover Michael! \r\n(The name association
    to Sweden may be a red herring - It's from the referential empire of Factory Records
    - then again, that reference might explain the choice of type)\r\n\r\nThanks,
    post again back if you have more thoughts.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are on Sweden, anyone
    know the recurrent typeface in the work of Olle Eksell?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/omslag_eksell_3715.png]"
