  body: The fat face font is <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/fat-face/?testdrive=src%3Dcustom%26text%3DJune%252019th%26size%3D81%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3DFFFFFF%26w%3D720%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26dock%3Dfalse%26seed%3D20">ITC
    Fat Face</a>, which it looks like only URW carries currently. The other one looks
    like Helvetica Neue, possibly with some modifications (like the "t" and the "i"
    dot).
