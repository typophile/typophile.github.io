  gets the cover pic on the \"G\" section, which also notes that he designed the big
  \"G\" they use for a logo (I'm guessing this means it comes from one of his faces
  rather than being a separate job)."

    servers and whatnot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. after several minutes, the actual article
    still never loaded for me. I gave up. \r\n\r\nThe article may very well have mentioned
    this: Carter will be receiving the 2010 AIGA Boston Fellow Award at <a href=\"http://boston.aiga.org/events/2010/09/46833557\">a
    reception next Friday</a>. Should be a good gathering. Can\u2019t swear that there
    are any tickets left at this point.\r\n\r\n"
