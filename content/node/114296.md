  body: Mike did a good call with Arrow even if the [[http://www.treacyfaces.com/TFArrow_interiors.php|TreacyFaces
    version]] looks not so elegant to me. I'm pretty convinced this one is Mark Simonson's
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/goldenbook|Goldenbook]].

  body: "Good call Ryuk. I didn't recall Golden Book had such a light weight, and
    these letters are not enough to use the Serif Guide, as only the E is a key letter.
    I agree Mark's font is much nicer. Image Club used to have a version of Arrow,
    and it does look similar, but Goldenbook it is.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
