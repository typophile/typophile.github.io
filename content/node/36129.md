  body: The meeting was great. Lots of enthusiastic folks from the region, plus some
    folks who came in from NYC and Cleveland just for the event. Many ideas came out
    of the gathering. We also scouted some very cool locations for special events,
    tours, and workshop. I'm psyched - Buffalo's going to give us an awesome TypeCon.

  body: "Sounds great. I grew up in buffalo and still visit friends and family there
    every summer. I know what kind of amazing things Buffalo has and also know how
    hard it can be to convince people that have never been there of them. On the other
    side of that though, when I mention Buffalo to anyone that has visited there,
    they always light up and mention how wonderful a place it is; whether they are
    an art lover who has actually made the trip to see the Albright Knox, or just
    someone who enjoys camping in western New York because \"It's beautiful country.\"
    So I was shocked when I heard typecon would be there next year. I mean, San Francisco,
    New York, Boston, Seattle, ... Buffalo. It is a bold and surprising choice. And
    a great idea.\r\n\r\nDerek\r\n\r\n"

    investigation there are 51 resturants and bars within .2 miles of the Hotel &
    107 within a 1 mile radius. As in all cities there are a couple I would not recommend,
    but there are a few gems in the mix including the #6 steak house in the county
    is actually located in the hotel itself. Also, food for thought the bars & clubs
    do not close until 4 am.\r\n\r\nSee everyone soon!\r\nCarima"

  body: "I've been to Buffalo about half a dozen times and enjoyed every visit. This
    trip, we zoomed out to the Roycroft campus (in East Aurora, just 20 minutes from
    the conference hotel) and toured one of the Karpeles manuscript museums (Buffalo
    has two). Had dinner at Empire - great food, well-priced, and a menu of deliciously
    colorful specialty martinis. Went to a networking shindig on the fantail deck
    of the USS Little Rock - on the waterfront - a gorgeous sunset experience. Played
    trivia for glory and ate and drank on the cheap at a wings-specializing bar. Took
    the kiddos bowling at Kenmore Lanes (they have the best bowling alley signage
    I've seen in a long time). Down by the water again to sugar up the boys at a custard
    stand much beloved by seagulls. Drove around the city to scope out the beautiful
    architecture, ghostly lettering on brick walls, and plethora of funky neon. Will
    hit more museums and check out the wee-hours entertainment when I return in the
    fall.\r\n\r\nThere are so many venues for special events and field trips that
    we are going to have a hard time fitting it all in. But we'll do our best :)\r\n"

    year (and being better organized than I was this year!)."
