  ), which although I don't really support it (for these reasons : http://www.wrongingrights.com/2009/03/worst-idea-ever.html
  and http://www.wrongingrights.com/2012/03/the-definitive-kony-2012-drinking-game.html
  ) I did however find their typography quite interesting. Can someone please help
  me identify it?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nTheo"

  body: "Jeffrey is right. The H+FJ-FAQ says: \r\n\r\n\xBBCan I use your fonts through
    @font-face, or a webfont hosting service? Not yet, but webfonts from H&FJ are
    coming soon. Right now we're working to ensure that each of our thousands of typefaces
    looks as good on screen as it does in print, and can be delivered with the kind
    of reliability that both designers and their clients have come to expect from
    H&FJ. To paraphrase MCA, we\u2019re working on it, please be patient.\xAB"
