body: "All,\r\n\r\nThe logo-design spec calls for geometrically round \\o\\, \\a\\,
  \\e\\, and \\d\\, and a calligraphic \\W\\ that expresses reserved, *elegant* beauty
  in a personable, approachable way. I wondered if there wasn't a way to fuse them;
  to decorate the tops of the ascenders in such a way as to draw them together with
  the calligraphy of the \\W\\.\r\n\r\nI have a first draft, but it is apparent that
  I need more experience, and attention to far more of the details. And so I submit
  my very humble work to the crucible here, and solicit your advice on how to proceed!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/woodendale3_6249.jpg]"

    for that kind of sorts.

  body: "I see! No pen that would draw even stroke widths and square ends would *also*
    draw the thicks and thins in the caligraphic \\W\\, or the tapering thing that's
    in the tops of the \\d\\ and \\l\\. I knew the mash-up didn't feel harmonious,
    but I couldn't put a finger on any of the \"why\"s. Thanks for the Type Design
    101 tip!\r\n\r\n(Re-reading, I see that it would be easy to read this comment
    as sarcastic, but it's not. Being still a beginner, I appreciate the guidance.)"

  body: "Some random sggestion:\r\n- try with a even more calligraphic contrasted
    W.\r\n- as you noted, thicks and thins should match among all letters.\r\n- also,
    the swashes should be of the same kind.\r\n- for elegance and balance, you could
    also experiment with non-swashed but very tall d's ascenders.\r\n- finally, you
    could print out just the needed circles and experiment sketching different variations
    for W, ascenders, and maybe even n."

  body: "Andreas,\r\n\r\nSorry, I think you may have misunderstood me. What I was
    trying to say was: \"you're absolutely right, and I ought to do exactly as you
    suggest.\" No offense was meant.\r\n\r\nRiccardo mentioned \"thicks and thins
    should match among all letters,\" and that's all I was saying: I would have noticed
    that as soon as I took out a pen to draw the letters.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nAmado"
