  10 July up to twelve people can enroll in the Department of Typography at Reading,
  to extend their design skills and knowledge in typeface design. We will provide
  near-constant access to the core teachers on the MA programme (Gerry Leonidas, Fiona
  Ross, and Gerard Unger) in a structured schedule. Additional sessions will be held
  with Paul Luna, Dan Rhatigan, and Rob Waller. \r\n\r\nWe will look closely at typeface
  design for specific applications and help develop suitable design processes. We
  will deal in depth with the design issues surrounding world scripts, and we will
  address the balance of originality and utility in typeface design, and the development
  of quality within an extended family. Throughout the course we will make frequent
  use of our world-class collections on typography and typeface design. There will
  be ample opportunity for detailed feedback on the participants' own work.\r\n\r\nWe
  expect participation by established typographers and graphic designers, and researchers
  in related fields: people with enough experience to be able to work rapidly and
  engage at a high level.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull information is available on http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/

    I'd be right on it.
