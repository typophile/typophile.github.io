Alcohol and Drug dependence is an equal opportunity disease.&nbsp; However, the effects and risks to women in particular are unique. <a href="http://www.soberlivingoutpatient.com"><strong>Outpatient drug rehab</strong></a> has observed that women appear to be much more susceptible to the harmful effects of alcohol and drug dependence than men, even though men, as a whole, are more inclined to abuse drugs and alcohol and develop alcoholism and drug dependence. Thus, this article seeks to briefly address the impact of drug addiction and alcoholism as it relates specifically to females and observations recognized by outpatient drug rehab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Females are more likely to have negative consequences and develop drug and alcohol related diseases much quicker than males. Additionally, studies demonstrate that females require less ingestion's of a substance prior to developing the negative health effects. Moreover, studies show and outpatient drug rehab statistics show that women are more likely to self-medicate by abusing alcohol and drugs when they are suffering from depression, stress, anxiety or emotional problems.</p>
<p>
Studies have demonstrated and outpatient drug rehab has observed that females who drink more than 7 alcoholic drinks in a seven-day period are at much higher and increased risk of being involved in fatal car accidents, high blood pressure, cancer, stroke and self-inflicted injury or suicide. Additionally, females who drink more than 7 alcoholic drinks in a seven-day period have an increased rate of drug and alcohol dependence.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Common Health Problems Suffered by Women who develop Drug and Alcohol Dependence </strong></p>
<p>
Abuse of drugs and alcohol by females makes them more susceptible than men to the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Liver dysfunction.</strong> Females who develop alcohol or drug dependence are more susceptible than men to developing liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Brain damage.</strong>Conditions such as reduced brain size and alcohol and drug induced brain disease and dysfunction are much more common in females than men who are drug and alcohol dependent.</li>
</ol>
<p>
A comparison of women who suffer from drug and alcohol dependence and those who are in outpatient drug rehab, compared to those who drink in moderation or not at all indicates that those suffering from dependence are at an increased risk of Osteoporosis, frequent injuries from falling, increased risk of hip fractures, increased risk of infertility, increased risk of miscarriage, early onset of menopause and increased risk of high blood pressure.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Increased Alcohol usage increases the Risk of Breast Cancer</strong></p>
<p>
As a female increase alcohol intake, her risk of developing breast cancer increases. The studies demonstrate that as a female increases her intake of alcohol by 10 gram increments per day, the relative risk of developing breast cancer increases 10% over the lifetime of the woman. If a female abstains from all alcohol intakes over her lifetime, the risk of developing breast cancer is roughly 9%. However, if a female ingest two drinks per day her risk of developing breast cancer increases to 10%. Moreover, if a female ingests six drinks per day her risk of developing breast cancer increases to 13%<br />
	<br />
Prevalence of Women and Girls Drinking</p>
<p>
According to a 2009 survey, approximately 47% of women ages 12 and over in the United States reported being current drinkers, defined as having had a drink in the past 30 days.</p>
<p>
Trends suggest and outpatient drug rehab has observed that white, employed women are drinking greater amounts of alcohol and with greater frequency. Some of this increase may reflect a greater comfort on the part of women to discuss their drinking.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Female Drinking is becoming more socially acceptable</strong></p>
<p>
Over history, it has been socially unacceptable for women to abuse drugs and alcohol. Society has placed much more shame on women as compared to men who drink to excess. However, it appears that among the younger female population, this stigma is beginning to fade and become more acceptable in society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
According to data from a survey of almost 18,000 college students across the U.S., about one in three female students engage in binge drinking (consuming four or more drinks in a row, often in quick succession).</p>
<p>
	Additionally, as it applies to females:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
The rate of binge drinking in all-female colleges more than doubled between 1993 and 2001.</li>
	<li>
While more college men are dependent on alcohol, women constitute more than half of alcohol abusers among college students.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Risky Drinking is easy to accomplish without noticing</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Standard drink quantities are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Beer of Wine in a 12 ounce glass or plastic bottle</li>
	<li>
		A glass of wine measuring 5 ounces</li>
	<li>
		1.5 ounces of alcohol or distilled 80 proof liquor</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Studies have defined moderate drinking to include less than seven drinks in a seven-day period and less than three drinks on any particular day. Factors such as height, weight, genetic composition, family history and age are all factors that women must consider when determining the amount of alcohol that she can safely ingest. Note, it is easy, especially for females to cross the stated levels above.</p>
<p>
	All of the research indicates that any alcohol ingestion by females during pregnancy is unsafe.&nbsp; Additionally some scientists agree that the risk of injury far outweighs the benefits of any ingestion of alcohol by females.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Because women become addicted to alcohol more easily than men, drinking even moderately can be a slippery slope. This is especially true for older women. In fact, about half of all cases of alcoholism in women begin after age 59.</p>
<p>
	Certainly, no one should feel obliged to start drinking for the health benefits. There are plenty of other ways to safeguard your health, such as regular exercise, a nutritious diet, keeping your weight under control, and not smoking. But for women who enjoy alcoholic beverages, it’s important to know where to draw the line, and to be prepared to redraw it as you get older</p>
<p>
	<strong>Why are women more sensitive to the effects of alcohol?</strong></p>
<p>
	Several biological factors that have been observed in outpatient drug rehab make women more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol than men.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Body fat.</strong> Women tend to weigh less than men, and—pound for pound—a woman’s body contains less water and more fatty tissue than a man’s. Because fat retains alcohol while water dilutes it, alcohol remains at higher concentrations for longer periods of time in a woman’s body, exposing her brain and other organs to more alcohol.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Enzymes.</strong> Women have lower levels of two enzymes—alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase—that metabolize (break down) alcohol in the stomach and liver. As a result, women absorb more alcohol into their bloodstreams than men.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Hormones. </strong>Changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle may also affect how a woman metabolizes alcohol.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	These biological factors explain why women become intoxicated after drinking less and are more likely to suffer adverse consequences after drinking smaller quantities and for fewer years than men.</p>
