  Indesign;\r\nWhile practising/testing different Typefaces to use in a Magazine,
  I've been emulating different Magazine Layouts - to try and get a similar result
  etc.  (this is usually the best way for me to learn, I'm a beginner.) \r\n\r\nE.g.
  Juxtapoz Magazine - the body text ID is Helvetica Neue Light 45\r\n(I think)\r\n\r\nImage
  of Magazine: \r\n [[http://samanthagrego.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/j4.jpg]]\r\n\r\nWhen
  exporting a PDF - the font doesn't quite look the same/the result isn't what I was
  hoping for. \r\n\r\nIs this simply because the printed text will always look different
  to the PDF version ? \r\n\r\nOr am I completely missing something ? \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    ?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe answer is yes: there is a tremendous difference between a virtual
    anything and the real thing, especially so in documents\u2026"

  body: "One of the things that seems hardest for people to get their heads around
    is that printed mater will look different, not only than from how it looks on
    the screen, but from what materials and techniques were used in printing.\r\n\r\nThe
    way paper takes ink -- and ink itself -- varies.  Taking the second first, the
    dry ink (toner) from a laser printer is quite different than the \"wet\" ink from
    an offset press. This is more than just the color, more important is how the ink
    disperses.\r\n\r\nPaper too affects the ink absorption/dispersion. Even limiting
    oneself to the offset press, ink spreads more with an uncoated sheet than with
    a coated one.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding this, being able to select the right fonts
    for the materials & processes used, is a matter of experience. I don't know any
    shortcuts aside from looking at what \"goes in\" and taking note of what \"comes
    out. \" \r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBy the way: you didn't ask, but halftones too are
    affected by paper choice. The dynamic range of a halftone on an uncoated sheet
    is about 10:1 (arithmetic). A coated sheet will take that to 20:1 or 25:1, primarily
    in how black you can get, though whiteness too is a factor.  The dynamic range
    of your computer monitor depends on ambient light in the room and how much hits
    the screen, but 100:1 can be achieved.\r\n\r\nIt follows that preparing halftones
    for printing requires knowing in advance how they will be printed. You'll make
    different choices in bringing out shadow detail depending on the black point of
    the ink on a particular paper. Take a loupe & look at a \"black\" headline on
    a newspaper -- you'll be amazed at how much white you see, where there isn't suppose
    to be any.\r\n\r\nThis can kind of be pre-planned, but the tools to get a good
    ICC profile are not cheap, and measuring \"what comes back\" requires making some
    of your own tools -- I know of no commercially available ones.\r\n\r\nDaunting,
    isn't it?"

  body: "cbkinetic... perhaps a way to translate what the above comments seem to suggest:\r\n\r\n1.
    Choosing a type is part technology, part communications art, and part ego...\r\n\r\n2.
    The technology part is basically first defining what specific medium in which
    you plan to communicate... type reacts very differently on paper (and various
    types of paper) versus screen (including pdf for viewing and/or pdf for printing).
    Depending on the type of paper, readability is a primary factor (certain types
    of paper soak up ink, whereas other types of paper might make certain typefaces
    toooo crisp and draw attention to the type). Choosing type for screen is also
    a challenge. Typically, Sans-serif are used for body text... but modern technology
    is beginning to blur this concept. \r\n\r\nHelvetica is not generally regarded
    as being a typeface suitable for long body text because it is a bit too dense...
    if you are looking for sans as a body text, then look more toward Fakt (OurType)
    (diverse, has several alternate characters that changes Fakt from grotesque to
    neo-grot {like helvetica, but much better}, to humanist), Walbaum Grotesque Book
    (Storm Type), Myriad Pro (Adobe), Greta Sans (Typotheque) (excellent for newspaper),
    FF Milo, and the like...\r\n\r\n3. Each one of the types mentioned above possesses
    a natural \"voice\" or \"color\"... you need to be clear about what voice the
    audience is wanting/needing to hear from you...\r\n\r\n4. Ego comes into the picture
    when you or the audience simply 'tire' of a certain typeface, and you want something
    in the same \"voice\" but a bit different or new...\r\n\r\nDon't let these old
    guys intimidate you... they were once young and wet behind the ears... the journey
    has to begin somewhere... keep us apprised of your progress...\r\n\r\nCheers."

    onscreen. Or professionally printed vs. printed on your inkjet. Or printed on
    glossy paper vs. uncoated paper, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAs Charles pointed out,
    there are many factors involved."

  body: "\r\nThank you all for your responses/advice, I cannot express just how much
    this has helped - it is really appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you also for the typeface
    suggestions; as I already own a copy of Myriad Pro (Adobe), I've decided to use
    this typeface for the text body (or at least see how it goes).  After doing some
    quick tests/experiments, it looks quite good when exported as a PDF and it also
    seems to hold its shape/colour when using the zoom function in Acrobat (which
    was frustrating me greatly, when trying out many typefaces). \r\n\r\n/ / \r\n\r\nI'm
    currently studying an introductory course in Graphic Design and my current project
    is a 4 page magazine spread - which is to be submitted in PDF format. \r\n\r\nMy
    spread is to be based on an Interview with an Artist (Killian Eng), I wanted to
    use the images as the highlight/main showcase of the spread - with only the use
    of two different typefaces for the text for contrast (sans + serif), along with
    the idea of keeping the text looking subtle and clean (if that makes sense)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
