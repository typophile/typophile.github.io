  body: "to my eye, it looks nice as it is. except for the color of the arabic font.
    and it would be consistent if the pixel squares' colors were then changed to red,
    black and whatever new color is chosen for the arabic font.\r\n\r\nof course,
    only you know why the need for a re-design. i am sure the group would need to
    know the terms of reference for the redesign for them to help more meaningfully."

  body: I like it, but agree with aluminum (no need for the gray shadow). Also, I
    think the a's look a bit forced. Try to make the curves look more natural.
