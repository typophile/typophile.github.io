    fonts here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.perfecttableplan.com/html/fonts.html\r\n\r\nI downloaded
    it but don't know how to use it? When I open the zip file I see a lot of folders
    and each folder has a TTF file? I don't understand how to write my line of text
    using what I've downloaded, help?\r\n\r\n"

    one of your Fonts folders, either your System fonts folder, or the one under Windows.
    I am a Mac user, so I may not have the most up to date terms. Then you select
    the font from your graphics or word processing program.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    BUT I opened Notepad and type the same text, selected the \"Caligrapher\" and
    the text does not look exactly the text in the logo mentioned, especially the
    capital M, W and P letters?"

  body: "Yes, I think there are several customized fonts that are based on El Greco.
    The differences are in the initials, and mostly they add the same shapes to the
    top of the letters, like the A and M. \"Caligrapher\" may be closer to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/el-greco-bq/|El
    Greco]] itself. Did you look at the one at TypOasis that I linked? I think it
    matches pretty well except for the P, which might have been borrowed from Poetica,
    or another calligraphic style font. Most of the letters in your sample were certainly
    based on El Greco, or one of its derivatives.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
