body: "I've got a client that is having some of their branding re-done, but they don't
  have a clue who did this one or what the font is. Any help is greatly appreciated!
  \r\n\r\nIt's the \"KLINE\" font I'm having trouble with. It's pretty close to MVB
  Magnesium, but it has uniform strokes, whereas MVB Magnesium has a combination of
  broad/narrow strokes.\r\n\r\nThe \"construction\" font is Times New Roman bold.
  \r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can offer!\r\n\r\n[URL=http://img58.imageshack.us/my.php?image=klineconstlogosmallxs0.png][IMG]http://img58.imageshack.us/img58/8157/klineconstlogosmallxs0.th.png[/IMG][/URL]"
