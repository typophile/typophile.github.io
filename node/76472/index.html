  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm working on a project about design by committee / consensus and I really need some help with it. Essentially the idea is to make a book with all the decisions about its design made within this forum. The aesthetics of the book - it's size, format, layout, typeface etc will all decided by the consensus in here.

Firstly, what do people think about the size of the book should be? And in terms of the title, I have two starting points - 'A Camel is a Horse Designed by Committee' and 'Too Many Cooks'.

I'd really appreciate any comments and suggestions on this project.

Thanks

First: with "cooks" in the title is easily mistaken for a cooking book.
Second: A4 or B5 is always a good starting point, depending on the content. If it's just text, you could go with the standard pocket book B-size: 130 mm x 198 mm.

Body text and headlines set in Adobe Caslon.

This is my two cents worth.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks. I like the B-size (130mm x 198mm) and using cooks in the title could well lead to it being mistaken for a cooking book. That's a good point.

Do you think Adobe Caslon for the whole book? or a different typeface for titles etc?

Also, should I start with a grid?

		<div class="commentbody">Well, Adobe Caslon is an excellent typeface, and since I know nothing of the content, that typeface is safe pick. And Adobe Caslon works really well in large sizes, so why not.

With a relatively small book, you should look at margins: you need to have room for fingers holding the book, so you could go with page numbering on top, and some 20 mm on top and outsides. Binding determines the inside margin: pocket book-style glue bind needs more than traditional binding, which opens more.

Or you could go with traditional Golden Section. All time classic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would like this book to be the B-size (130x198), yet it should also maintain the size of a broadsheet. It should be a tiny book that fits within a locket. 

It should be waterproof.

The type should be large and dark and light and very small. Maybe a little of each.

Lets use a great many photographs except that photographs are too specifiying in their nature, so the photographs, the great many of them, should be illustrated and vague. The illustrator should be drawing out-of-focus. The lines should be sharp and crisp.

If we have a photograph of a woman, perhaps that will exclude the men. So lets make the photograph of a woman a drawing of a gender-neutral stick figure. Give the gender-neutral stick some curves and a purse and long dangling tresses. Let it practice weight-lifting in an all-male gym.

It should be a lavish book featuring die-cuts and varnishes and foil stamps, and it should be affordable and nearly without cost to produce. Take Marian's "I Wonder," and the 7th Day Adventist's watchtower as influences. 

The tone should be a light comedic thunderous proclamation. 

The title should have the word "Cooks" in it, but without any reference to what happens in a kitchen.

(Thank you for letting me vent a little.)

It should be set in Caslon 14/16 pts. throughout, and cooks should not be mentioned on the title. It should be: "Needless complexity, internal inconsistency, logical flaws, banality, and the lack of a unifying vision". But the size should not be B-size (130x198), but A4 wide (297x210), with three (3) columns per (/) page.

		<div class="commentbody">We'll never reach consensus until a committee chairperson with absolute executive power is elected. I nominate myself. My platform for election consists of the following policies:

--The title shall be "Mugford Designs a Camel; or How We Cooked a Camel [NOT A COOKBOOK]"

--Titles will be in Adobe Chaparral Pro Caption 24/28, and captions shall be in Adobe Chaparral Pro Light Display 6 set solid.

--Text will be set in ______ [to be determined later, but let's not fool ourselves, it'll probably be Caslon]

--Page numbers shall be in 7-pt. Curlz Bold Italic.

--The book will be printed letterpress, with an extra-deep impression on both sides because that is what is fashionable these days.

--Paper shall be 8.5"x11", cut out of brown paper shopping bags with pinking shears for that jagged look that will be so popular with groupspeak researchers five years from now, then bound using the Japanese stab technique. A "recycled" icon shall be embossed on every page.

--Since Curlz and Chaparral are for some reason not available in lead type, you will need to start punchcutting lessons ASAP. I have cornered the market on antimony so you will need to start fundraising too.

--No photo-polymer plates can be used - that's "cheating".

--The book will contain no photos, except of members of this committee. These photos will actually be woodcuts.

--To appeal to an international audience, every third page should be printed with text running right-to-left.

--I like the idea of the book fitting inside a locket. A subcommittee shall be formed to investigate the practial upper limits of locket size. Perhaps the book can be placed inside a gigantic clock hung around the neck like Flavor Flav - a "clocket," as it were. Discuss.

--If we are unable to source a large enough drop-shadow-back-cover, then the last page of every chapter should be a slightly larger drop shadow page, cut with slightly larger-toothed pinking shears from a slightly darker color of paper bag.

--No ligatures may be used, with the exception of the "Th" ligature. Also, Phaeton catchwords shall be used for all instances of "the," "and," and "of," unless "The" is at the beginning of a sentence, in which case the Caslon "Th" ligature shall be followed by a Phaeton "e".

--Swashes everywhere!

Please support my campaign for chairperson.

Cover: b/w pics of a cooking pot, top view, broth spilled all over it. You can tone the broth by adding a green layer in photoshop and select ‘multiply’! In order to avoid misunderstandings, heads with toques on it should be poking out of the broth. Make sure that the (transparent) text overlaps the randomly arranged pictures.

For sure.

I propose that the illustrations be the user icon for each typophile who contributed. They should be blurred and with an added vignette. If desired, the typophiles can provide an alternate or higher resolution picture for themselves.

Also make sure to include a large photo of Pablo Impallari shirtless.


Also I think there should be a lot of decoration on the pages.

I accepted your invitation to alter your files. Here is the layout with some text from this thread.

It's just a basic design, although something that interprets each of the suggestions more literally could be lots of fun . . .

I think using the text of this thread is a fabulous idea. What do you think?

Thanks for your edited layout Josh. Using the text of this thread is a great idea. Perhaps we just need more content for the book. To flesh it out, as it were. 

And what do you think would be the best way to bring all these ideas together into one book?

		<div class="commentbody">Josh's edit to the spreads look fantastic. Although, the captions need to be in Adobe Chaparral Pro Light Display 6 set solid. This is very important for the look of the book and for legibility. Also, someone still needs to try making the page numbers in a different font. Curlz MT was suggested earlier, but I think that font may be much too childish. We need to try something by Ale Paul.

I think the cover as we currently have it has nothing of interest. Perhaps the cover should have all of the committee's user icons, either arranged in a grid fashion, or haphazardly. Thoughts?

The color also needs work. Yellow works for fontshop, but we're trying to make a classy book here. I think we'll all agree that blue with green and white text will work best. Also I think that Caslon works great for the text, but the cover needs something else. Alrt Text anyone?

The binding and paper choices. tmac suggested it be waterproof. Typophiles are notorious for doing things near water. The paper should be waterproof, and if the text doesn't run too long, hand-stitched fishing line binding. It should come wrapped in mylar.</div>

Wow. This is the right thing to do. Everyone likes a thing that can do two unrelated tasks -- for example, a television that produces toast, or a meat carving knife that makes a serviceable head rest. Therefore, you should be able to catch fish with this book.</div>

It would work well, too, because we're already die-cutting the cover to make the back larger for the drop-shadow. Since it needs to be waterproof, and the cover also has to be strong for the fishing line to be coiled on it and not break, I propose plastic for the cover.</div>

Why green? (Although we could easily ask why about anything else associated with this project, so I suppose green is as justifiable a choice as any.)

Could you do something more evocative with the icons than arrange them in a grid? Perhaps arrange them so as to suggest a camel, etc.?

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cover3_4887.jpg]

I think the cover needed spicing up and added some Japanese text. Also I got a random camel image off Google to use for the cover. This is perfectly legal. (Unless it is considered camel pornography....)

<blockquote>Well, the book could be sold in a ricepaper wrapper. After you eat the wrapper, you can use the waterproof book inside to go fishing. Or, alternatively, you immerse the book in water to make the wrapper dissolve so you can open the book. I would definitely like to see this manufactured!</blockquote>

I like ricepaper idea. People could also use the ricepaper wrapper to write on if they happened to run out of paper. Also, this would match with the Japanese style open-spine binding....

In regards to the fishhook to use, I'd recommend a #11 fishhook. These are probably the most versatile for catching fish in general.</div>

Actually I doubt if this is a "fair use" situation, even if you're a student, since you are not discussing the photographer's work but instead are simply using his copyrighted image for your own, unrelated purposes.  

This isn't intended as a criticism, it's just a comment, as I know this is just a hypothetical project.</div>

I think you may have missed the satire in that, James. Since this whole project is just a spoof and intended as a humorous display of all the things that go wrong with "Design by committee", I think his comment on "perfectly legal" is right on target with the rest of the thread.</div>

I suspect the committee does not agree with this comment. If people don't type in http:// they might end up on some government network accidentally, and then we'll be faced with wikileaks IV.

I'm not even sure the audience will know they should use a computer with the URL, or that the audience will even know what computer is.

Hmm... Who is our audience...? We'll have to find one that fits the description of not knowing to use a computer with the URL, or that doesn't know what a computer is.
Maybe it would be best to add some instructions in simple English so that any layman or infant can understand. Probably should use an asterisk.
But they might mistake it as part of the URL. So we'll have to set it apart somehow.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The solution to the URL ambiguity is obvious – you simply need to add clip art of a computer next to it, so that it shows that the URL is meant to be put into a computer. Maybe also prefix it with "URL:" to make sure people know it is a uniform resource locator, though. Maybe also an inviting line like "Find us on the web..." Yes, that'll definitely help this.

Oh, and I know I'm chiming in a bit late, but for my 2 cents on the text design: make sure to use historical ligatures, because the little curve joining "st" and "ct" really, really helps readability for modern eyes. And all numbers should be done with lc, italic roman numerals for that added air of class. When used with the full caps for the headings (we're using full caps for the headings, right?), the font size of the numerals should be doubled to make the lowercase letters rise to the cap height.</div>

Maybe for the browser, so that we can appeal to a more diverse audience, we should use the Mosaic web browser.</div>
