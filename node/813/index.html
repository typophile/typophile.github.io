I wanted to see if I could add a workable lower case, and try my hand at my own version of the upper case and symbols in a style that would make for a reductivist addition to my Seriatim family (now showing in the Sans Serif Critique Forum). <br> <br>The question behind the experiment is this: How much of each character can be removed while still allowing the human mind's phenomenon of "gestalt recognition" (recognizing the whole) to still resolve each individual character? <br> <br>The result seems to be very similar to a stencil font, but then it occurred to me that stencil fonts are another extension of this same question. In order to allow counters, etc., to remain in place in a stencil font, what parts of each character can be safely removed without compromising character recognition? Seriatim Gestalt simply takes it beyond the counters. <br> <br>As always, comments are appreciated and encouraged. <br> <br>David</div>

<div class=commentbody> > How much of each character can be removed .... <br> <br>A central issue, where even the questions (much less the answers) have yet to be properly formulated. <br> <br>Seriatim Gestalt: Some of your "solutions", like the lc "a", are really nice! <br> <br>Next step: Get yourself an audience, and do some real-world (although fundamentally informal) tests. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody>I love this concept -- I'm a big fan of J Hoefler's variant. you're goal, to include the lc is a truely valient one. you've done a wonderfully modest job on the ligatures! also, the uc M is really standing out to my eye here, the diagonals assist in completing the shape quite well. <br> <br>my overall impression is that you still have some research ahead of you. I'm not certain the components you are emphasizing are the essential ones (I'm thinking of the lc k & a at the moment). some of the characters seem less reductivist than decoratively geometric (the lc p & d, perhaps)</div>

<div class=commentbody> > some of the characters seem less reductivist than decoratively geometric <br> <br>Which leads directly to a central conundrum: <br>A font consisting of "gestalt-minimal" shapes isn't necessarily something anybody would actually want to use... Which doesn't make it a bad effort, not at all. But a *usable* font (as opposed to a truly experimental one, in the scientific/analytical sense) has to strike a compromise between theory and aesthetics. <br> <br>I can't read David's mind (for which I should probably be thankful ;-) but I wonder if he's worried about where this treacherous road leads, or if he's just enjoying the strange scenery (and there's nothing wrong with that, quite the contrary). <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Sometimes even *I* don't want to read my own mind... :D <br> <br>Actually, you've hit on something, though, Hrant -- this has been one of the more strange (yet fun) typographic forays I've taken. <br> <br>The lower-case "a" was a startling accident, as I played with forming an "a" out of a reversed "s". What you see above is what resulted. The upper-case "M" had a similar genesis, as I tinkered with the angles and strokes of the glyph. <br> <br>PlainClothes: <br>I agree that this experiemnt is far from complete. I'll probably go ahead and release this typeface soon, after a few adjustments, but I'll continue the experimentation toward perhaps creating an even more reductivist version sometime in the future. <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> > I played with forming an "a" out of a reversed "s" <br> <br>Which reminds me of an experiment I've been considering: making a font (probably out of Times) that substitutes other letters for the real ones, with some minimal manipulation. Like taking an "e", rotating it 180, and adding a small curling stroke to the bottom-right: one messed-up "a"! <br> <br>The main point would be to illustrate first-hand the difference between legibility (which would be totally devastated) versus readability (which would be affected much less, as long as the silhouette of each character is mostly maintained). <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Nice David. The human mind is pretty <br>amazing. (Um, not that your font isn't.) <br> <br>Hrant, the guys at Eyesaw had a face for a <br>while that was similar to what you describe... <br>(The site has now moved on, so I won't try to <br>find it.) If I were forced to guess I'd say it was <br>based on Andale Mono or the like. The E was <br>a flopped 3, the S a 5, the cap A an upside <br>down V, and so on. It was quite nice. <br> <br>T Y P O P H I L E <br> <br>7 4 P 0 P H 1 L 3 </div>
