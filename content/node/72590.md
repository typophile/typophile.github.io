  pasted each one into fontographer.\r\nThey look great in fontographer and look great
  in Fontbook. They show up fine in my Illustrator font list. When I type with the
  font, my stroke and fills are black, I get the text line, but my font is invisible.\r\nWHAT
  DID I DO WRONG?"

  body: "There are a few reasons why text might be invisible.\r\n\r\nOne is that the
    outlines are not closed -- i.e. that you have two nodes, one on top of the other,
    with no line connecting them --; this typically only affects one or two buggy
    glyphs, not a whole font, but it's possible that something in your Illustrator-to-Fontographer
    workflow has left the outlines open. As I recall, Illustrator doesn't care about
    open outlines. It should be possible to select all the glyphs in Fontographer
    and perform a remove overlap function, which will close any open glyphs.\r\n\r\nAnother
    possibility is that this is a font cache issue, which might explain why the font
    looks okay in FontBook but not in an application. I get this issue on Windows
    sometimes, if I am installing new versions of a font, and I need to restart the
    system in order to get the font to display properly."

    works likes previous versions, that would be CMD+A (to select all glyphs), then
    CMD+Shift+O (to remove Overlap)..."
