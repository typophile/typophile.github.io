  apart.\r\n\r\nIt's essentially a one-man business of a guy who comes to people's
  homes to cook a fabulous paella for them. The focus in this project was on the website
  itself. Along the way, we also decided to brush up his logo a little.\r\n\r\nPlease
  can you give me some feedback as to what could be improved further in this website?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot for any input!\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry for the website being in German only, but
  most of you will get the gist of it!"

  body: "I like your website.  I remember you working up a logo for this a while ago.
    \ I think your solution works great.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting for me to read about
    paella from a German point of view, considering that I am an American of Spanish
    descent (separated, admittedly, by many generations, and the establishment of
    family roots in the colony of Puerto Rico).\r\n\r\nA major issue I have with the
    site is your use of the red chili peppers as part of your menu navigation.  Paella
    doesn't call for red chili peppers (at least none of the traditional recipes I'm
    familiar with).  Plus, with my American eyes, it reads as a reference to Mexican
    food, and not Spanish food.  Or it could read as a reference to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili%27s|Chili's
    restaurant]], an American restaurant chain.  It could be fun, instead, to have
    little images of the traditional ingredients of paella: chicken, chorizo sausage
    (from Spain and Portugal, again, not the Mexican kind), clams, shrimp, mussels,
    etc.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the image of the paella bowl on the right side of the
    screen seems not to balance the rest of the elements on the left.  I would be
    more satisfied to see the menu and content div centered.  It's feeling a bit lopsided
    right now.  If you can think of arguments to keep it as it is, I would be open
    to hearing them, of course. \r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    my opinion with that in mind. \r\n\r\nWhen I think of paella, I see family gatherings.
    I see earthy warmth, generations of tradition, and the gathering of family itself
    is the very cause to prepare this feast. I see aprons spattered with sauce, oversize
    wooden picnic tables cluttered with colorful plates, and children hovering relentlessly
    for hours. Stone fireplaces, cast iron skillets, and rugged clay tiles. Heck,
    there's even a big headed dog wagging about. I can feel the silky fingers of a
    scrappy grandmother, warmly clutching my wrist as she feeds me a taste off a wooden
    spoon. I can't see any reason to be anywhere else on earth. (I smile and sip red
    wine from a clunky goblet made of blue glass...)\r\n\r\nYour website is clean
    and almost plastic looking. Where's the texture? Where's the tradition? Where's
    the fun? The unity? It just feels way too sterile.\r\n\r\nAgain, <em>my people</em>
    gather around cold steel kegs of beer - so maybe my impression of a paella feast
    is way off. Is it?"

    \"plastic\" as stated above. I know by the aprons it looks like these are colors
    they are using but it says McDonalds to me when I see this site. \r\n\r\n\r\nTry
    to put some more white within the body of the site and save yellow as an accent
    color. I think the header is fine but could use some work. Maybe pull the two
    words together. They already have contrast. The man w/ crossed arms could go to
    the left where number is.\r\n\r\nAlso those images in the background that are
    scaled back do not say \"professional\". I would lose the one behind the phone
    number and also the one behind the yellow background. You could pull the number
    and contact info to the right column and do something nice over there."

    talk about everyday.\r\n\r\nSo keep up the work on the website, it's not an easy

    main navigation has the same weight as the checked list underneath (though the
    list is smaller) and both have some sort of icon next to them with the same background
    color. First thing I did was rollover your main navigation, then see if I could
    click on the list underneath. Something to differentiate those would be very helpful
    as far as usability.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n"

    am going to implement most of your suggestions within the next two weeks or so.
    \r\n\r\nI'm a little surprised that some of you guys don't like the scaled back
    images in the background. I think especially the large pan makes the site look
    very sophisticated and defines the right edge of the site very nicely. No?\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I should have used another technique to scale back the image? I simply cropped
    the pan and then changed the layer opacity to something like 30%. Is there a better
    technique to achieve this? Maybe by decreasing the number of colours first?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

    project so far. There aren't actually that many gradients and even if there were
    that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. Nearly all \"award-winning\" websites
    I know use at least some kind of gradient at some point.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign
