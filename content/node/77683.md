body: "Went camping in October and really enjoyed the hand-lettering on all the park
  signs. Can anyone tell if this was based off a typeface that has been digitized?
  Obviously it's all hand-painted, but thought there was probably some sort of stencil
  used.\r\n\r\nLove the subtle curvature of the letter forms like A, V and N.\r\n\r\n-

    Although certainly not an exact match.\r\nIt's interesting though, how different
    some of the instance of the same letters are in the second sign. It doesn't look
    like they used a the same stencil or template to cut both \"v\"s, for example\r\n\r\nJason

  body: "\r\nResolute and Kabel are both pretty close. I did some more hunting and
    found one that has a similar open feel and curved diagonals, but it doesn't have
    the nice pointed intersects on the M V A & N like Resolute, Kabel and the hand
    painted signs have.\r\n\r\nFF Megano Black\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productId=552040\r\n\r\nIf
    someone mixed FF Megano Black and Kabel Bold, plus an up-curve to the leg of the
    R, I'd basically have it :)\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: camping is not supposed to be a luxury experience. there has to be a rough
    edge to it. only the <a href="http://www.signsny.com/hand-painted-signs">hand-painted
    signs</a> could bring the feel of a camp. none of the fancier signs would look
    nice next to a camp. hand painted signs are the best as far as the camps are concerned.
