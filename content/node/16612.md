  to my teachers, I need to use, every now and then, characters which are not found
  in the normal set of characters; e.g. \"p\" with a macron, or \"a\" with a macron
  and a ring.\r\n\r\nI've added these to my Times New Roman font using a font editor.
  Now my teacher(s) were very enthousiastic, and asked me to put the font on the internet.\r\n\r\nMy
  question is this: suppose I delete all original glyphs of TNR, and include in the
  font only my changed glyphs (\"p\" with a macron etc.) - will that still be unethical
  to put the font on the net? Should I ask someone's permission to do this?\r\n\r\nI
  want to stress,\r\n1. that certain glyphs we use at the university are very unique,
  they don't have even a unicode number, so they can not be purchased. \r\n2. that
  all added glyphs are based on TNR original glyphs: I just added the macron above
  the \"p\", etc.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nShai\r\n"

    are supported by Office 2003 SP2 using OpenType combining diacritics. The example
    here uses the Windows Vista version of Times New Roman.  \r\n\r\nedit - You'll

    However, there are several different opensource font projects that \"look like
    Times\". \r\n\r\nThe most ambitious seems to be the Savannah Free UCS Outline
    fonts: \r\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/freefont/\r\n\r\nTheir FreeSerif font is based
    on the GPL version of Nimbus Roman, which is a Times clone donated to the opensource
    community by URW++. Nimbus Roman is also included in GPL GhostScript: \r\nhttp://www.ghostscript.com/doc/GPL/index.htm\r\n\r\nBut
    since the FreeSerif project is more advanced, you may want to contribute your
    changes there. \r\n\r\nAlso, owners of Fontlab Ltd. products can use the FreeSerif
    font (unrelated to the previous one) that we offer on our site (http://www.fontlab.com/
    ). There are no licensing limitations for use of the font, you can modify it as
    you wish and distribute it under any terms. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam\r\n"
