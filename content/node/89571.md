  I mean that the shape of the letter looks like something, and that something has
  a name which starts by the same sound.\r\nFor example S and a snake.  b and bat
  and balls. M and Mountains.\r\nThe idea is to speed up the teaching of the alphabet
  by triggering some mnemotechnic association in a child's mind.\r\nI have found a
  couple of examples in english such as a \"Curious George\" book and a Rudyard Kipling
  short story.\r\nI was wondering if some forum members remember running across other
  examples and can give a reference.\r\n\r\nPaul Gouin\r\ngouinpaul@gmail.com"

    you might have an A made out of an Apple, and B out of a bat, C out of a car,
    etc. and in Spanish you'd have the A made out of a tree (\xE1rbol), B out of a
    bicycle (bicicleta) and C out of a house (casa), and so on for each other language."

  body: "Theunis, I imagine that in designing an appropriate alphabet for <em>every</em>
    language, selecting designs for the glyphs that can be used in more than one language
    might add as much work as it took away.\r\n\r\nI wonder about our fixation on
    the beginnings of words (which has given us so much trouble with X), and whether
    it is universal. If Germans do this, how do they deal with the fact that nothing
    starts with \xDF? I know different cultures have differing ideas of what constitutes
    a rhyme, for example. There are tribes who describe the future as \"back\" and
    the past as \"forward\" based on the compelling logic of which one they can see.
    Might there be written languages somewhere that would best organize a list by
    final sound, or whose idea of a monogram would be the stressed vowel in each name?"
