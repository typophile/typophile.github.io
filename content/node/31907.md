  first thought about flange from scan graphics or motter corpus from adobe but it
  is just  similar to them. \r\nI guess the Questionmark is a complete different tpyeface.\r\n\r\n2nd
  one: kind of bodoni? \r\n\r\nPerhaps someone knows it. Would really like to know
  what it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance & best regards,\r\nhi2hello"
