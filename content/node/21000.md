body: Long have I obeyed the maxim of [[typeface pairing|pairing serifs with sans]]
  but I'm designing a workbook where the client prefers the more informal appearance
  of sans serif type faces.  I've been told that it's more about choosing two very
  different fonts.  If I'm using something like Futura for my title font, should I
  really stick to a serifed typeface?  Would something like Helvetica Neue Light look
  sloppy?  Thanks for the help.

  body: Granted, I do a lot of advertising design and we all know advertising design
    gets away with a little more. But on a little 1-sheet that I had to do which contained
    a lot of information I used three different sans with one serif. I've been told
    it looks good. Maybe the people were lying. ;^)

  body: It can be done, if you use two distictive typefaces differenciating themselves
    enough. Sans serif used for longer body copy can be though. Depending on the overall
    design and the masses of text it could look nice if it's well executed. Good luck!

  body: I've found a book from the 1930s that combines a very bold Kabel for the title
    page, with the "little information" in Futura. This probably only works because
    the bold Kabel is so strong and the Futura is relatively light by comparison.

  body: Thanks for the advice.  I think I'll go with one family.  Maybe Gill Sans
    or Franklin Gothic.  The book is going to have a lot of tables and bullet points.  What
    body text there is I'll probably set in a serifed face.

  body: Gill doesn't have the versatility of Franklin Gothic altho it is a little
    more elegant. You might also look into The Sans or Meta which are more rounded
    and include small caps and fractions.

    suggestion. Franklin is good for big headline type, News is good for space-saving.
    You can also throw in Trade Gothic for text.\r\n\r\nI have had success mixing
    19th-century grotesques, though the appearance is more specialized. Grotesque
    MT, Gothic 13, Alternate Gothic #2 all mix nicely and create a living texture
    on the page. Additionally Champion can be thrown in with discretion, but it looks
    more 'designed' so it tends to leech away some of the quaintness."

  body: "Frutiger's univers is a big family with a touch of humanist and geometric
    character with a sans. Maybe choose a stronger humanist-sans like frutiger or
    gill sans for whismsical and warm text without the serifs. Basically pick a sans
    with a large family AND the personality you want. I love franklin but it's heavy,
    cold and dark compared to the humanist-sans... might be what you want. Have fun
    with this challenge!\r\n\r\nGo trendy\u2013consider pairing a very bold or book
    for small body text with a very light/ thin font in the family for large titling/headers.

  body: "News and Franklin Gothic, eh? The very idea of pairing two gothic faces together
    shudders me.\r\n\r\nI would just suggest pairing the many variants within a font.
    If you feel that weight emphasis isn't enough, go width-wise. I find that pairing
    a light extended grotesk (say, Univers 43) with a body copy of its regular variant
    (Univers 55) works very well. Or pair a regular with a condensed (Univers condensed
    is surprisingly readable!) Or a thin ultra condensed with a regular. From here
    on, the possibilities are endless, as long as you make the two face widths and/or
    weights <em>different enough.</em>"

  body: Being into movie stuff, this topic reminds me of the Dolby Labs logo program
    which pairs weights of Eurostile and Helvetica. I'm not sure that combination
    really works, but the brand mark is highly ubiquitous. Even just now while I was
    typing I saw a Dolby Digital logo crawl up the screen in end credits on IFC.

    are 45 of the most popular fonts in the app, set up as headline and body. You
    just swipe left or right to change the headline or body. You can create a couple
    thousand variations. \r\n\r\nFor instance, you can set News Gothic Bold as headline
    and Franklin Gothic as the body and see how it looks. Then you can flip it around
    and set Franklin Gothic Demi as the header and News Gothic as the body. They both
    work nice, though I didn't know the history about those two typefaces until I
    read this article! \r\n\r\nThere are quite a few classic serifs in the app to
    play with (Avenir, Centurty, Helvetica, Din, Eurostyle, etc.).\r\n\r\nTake a look.
    There is a resource book coming out too that showcases a lot more variety per
    example."
