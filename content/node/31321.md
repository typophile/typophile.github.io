  body: "It also has a strong resemblance to <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/sarahscript.shtml\">Sarah
    Script'</a> from Letterhead Fonts, although that one isn't as heavy. It's like
    Patty King's 'Kick' met 'Sarah Script'.\r\n\r\nAlso noticed that Sign DNA has
    at least one very similar style, called <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptSmall5/HotShotDNA.gif\">Hot
    Shot DNA</a>.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
