  body: nice work. I especially like lc &#34;g&#34;, &#34;o&#34;, &#34;r&#34;.  <BR>some
    of the shapes however do not seem to got together in same face. &#34;f&#34; is
    very heavy on top, &#34;s&#34; needs some work, although &#34;a&#34; and &#39;s&#34;
    will properly work well together somehow they look different from the rest.  <BR>Keep
    up the good work..look forward to seeing refinements.

  body: I like your &#39;g&#39; but I think the verticals in the &#39;h&#39; &#39;b&#39;
    are a bit too strong, maybe because of teh large eye in the &#39;b&#39;. <BR>But
    overal it&#39;s a pretty good idea I think

  body: regarding the h and b ascenders, you might consider tapering the tops like
    the t. that would definitely lighten them, and i don&#39;t think it would be inconsistent.
    but it may make them appear &#34;pointy&#34; at small sizes. it may also contribute
    to an overall &#34;forward&#34; motion.  <BR> <BR>you might want to consider moving
    the tapering stroke of the a to the bottom, to lighten up that joint near the
    baseline, and let the upper portion of the bowl remain &#40;optically&#41; monoline.
