body: I received a free sample book in the mail all about Adrian Frutiger&#39;s typeface,
  &#34;Avenir&#34;. I lost it, and really want another one. I&#39;m guessing it was
  from Linotype, but can&#39;t find any more info on such a book. It came in the mail
  with another book about Frutiger and Univers. Each one was specifically about that
  typeface, and its history, maker, and uses. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of this book,
  or have any more info about it? <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>Nate
