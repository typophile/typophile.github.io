  The 'p' and 'y' characters are very unique...hoping someone may know this one. Grateful

    Nicolas Cochin</a> \"Many foundries including Lanston released versions in the
    1920s. Several digital versions can now be found, but none have kept the irregular
    details of the metal type which include strokes that cross over each other as
    if hand drawn (see letters K & y). The new Lanston digitization is the only digital
    version to retain the idiosyncratic treatment which makes the metal type so alluring.\"\r\nDon"
