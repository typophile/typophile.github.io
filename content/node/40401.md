    on the Best Numberals thread, that thing has ligated numbers by way of a two level
    crossbar arrangement. Commercially available in about three months.\r\n\r\nYes
    you'd have loads more fun---design potential---with hanging figures. I tend to
    make uniheight lining structured fonts\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    made the 20 ligature because the same enclosed space in the design must contain
    the numbers 0 through 21.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lig20_6044.png]"

  body: "Yeah buddaye! Russell, this is a fine idea and just what we need---an excuse
    to make more ligurinos. I'm getting my ligated numerals on right now. I love your
    ligated number forty-five. Agreeably sinewy, iIt gives me a perfect excuse to
    use another hyphenate :^)\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
