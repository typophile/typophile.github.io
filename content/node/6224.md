  Lange&#39;s interview</a> in <BR>Andy Crewdson&#39;s new series, posted today, is
  quite nice. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s interesting to see Crewdson&#39;s evolution, from
  eager beginner <BR>at Typo-L, to successful typoblogger who in a fit of rage destroys
  <BR>all existing archives of his files, to a sort of typo-recluse who <BR>periodically
  puts out some fine, long texts. But he&#39;s doing a good <BR>job in this. <BR>
  <BR>Maybe Joe Clark was, unwillingly, the Pygmalion here.'

    If the former, who&#39;s Galatea? I hope he&#39;s not Paphos, &#39;cause I&#39;ll
    have to sue him: I have a font by that name coming out... uh... in two weeks.  ;-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>The article is superb. I&#39;m lucky to be taking Gerald&#39;s letterpress
    class &#40;the first session was this past Tuesday&#41;, and even though I&#39;m
    a digitboy I expect to learn a lot. <BR> <BR>BTW, I don&#39;t think it was &#34;rage&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
