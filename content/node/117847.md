body: "Hello everyone! I'm trying to come up with a good name for a typeface and in
  fact I was kinda set with one which I checked there was no released font using it.
  BUT, the name exists for an instant-coffee brand. I'm unsure if I can or cannot
  use this name in a typeface design. Trying to think about it using car names, I
  tend to think it's not allowed (like, releasing Prius sans, for example) but I couldn't
  find any precise info about this.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nGabriel"

  body: "I don\u2019t know about possible legal restrictions, but I would advise against
    using a brand name that is already taken for your typeface, simply for reasons
    of practicality. When, as a potential customer, you search the internet for \u2018Maiola\u2019,
    \u2018Gentium\u2019 or \u2018Grotext\u2019, the typefaces come up as the first
    or one of the first results (at least for me on google.com). For \u2018More\u2019,
    \u2018Scala\u2019 or \u2018Utopia\u2019, that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m not
    saying that the latter are bad typeface names (because you can always add \u2018font\u2019
    to your query and get to what you want). I just think that it\u2019s an added
    benefit if your typeface can have a name that\u2019s both memorable, easy to pronounce
    in many languages and (relatively) unique. Before settling for something suboptimal,
    I would first try to explore if you can find a name that satisfies these requirements."

  body: "Picking a name is hard, sometimes very hard. Pick an interesting and perhaps
    unusual word, then try variations on it as a possibility. Look at the typeface
    and think about it; does it bring an image to mind that would be useful in naming
    it, a word or words that kind of describe the feel of it? Sometimes it can take
    days or even weeks to come up with a name you are happy with.\r\n\r\nJust try
    to make sure it doesn't mean something ridiculous or offensive in another language.
    It also doesn't help much if it sounds like a medication or medical condition.
    Avoid words that can be associated with historical figures or places that have
    a very bad reputation; Hitler Bold, for instance.\r\n\r\nYour example of Prius
    is something to think about. Prius is a Latin word meaning \"before\". Since you
    are not building cars and offering them for sale to the public I believe that
    since it is a normal word you could use it as it is for fonts. \r\n\r\nYou could
    call it a name like \"Impala\", for instance, and General Motors wouldn't likely
    complain because an impala is also an animal. Whatever you call it, if it is or
    sounds like a known trademark then tack on a descriptor such as Regular to it
    to make it more unique. \r\n\r\nUnless you are a large company with a lot of money
    the most trouble you would get into is receiving a letter from Toyota's law firm
    demanding that you stop using the name \"Prius Regular\" for your fonts. They
    will not appear in person at your door to put you in handcuffs.\r\n\r\nAll that
    being said, I am not a lawyer, merely someone like you who has to come up with
    good names to use. Also like you, I don't go out of my way to invite trouble.
    Just use common sense and you'll be fine.\r\n"

  body: "What other have said. I would add that it also depends on the renown/obscurity
    of the brand in question (I would advise against calling a typeface \u201CNescaf\xE9\u201D,
    for instance). Lastly, make sure the name looks good when typeset using your font!

  body: "A common name like apple can co-exist as a Beatles record company and a Steve
    Jobs computer company. But for a name with strong established associations you
    might have problems. For example I would avoid a font name like Disney. The safest
    course is a neologism like the ones that flood corporate identities, such as Exxon
    -- create your own, don't use this one. Or do a compound that differentiates your
    product from an established coffee brand, like VerdeBlueMountain. Try to stand
    out and be memorable, like VerdeJavaJolt or Verdeccino -- a wordplay on cappuccino.
