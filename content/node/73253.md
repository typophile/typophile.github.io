body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nCould someone be so kind to recommend Didone typefaces that are
  able to compete with HTF Didot in both style and quality? I love HTF Didot, but
  cannot use if for the project I am working on.\r\n\r\nAs a reference, I have attached
  both a page from Vogue Living Australia which I think uses HTF Didot (please correct
  me if I am wrong), and a cover of Living etc. which seems to use another kind of
  a Didone typeface - any ideas what that could be? This is the style and context
  I am thinking about. \r\n\r\nI am interested in any possible links and I am also
  keen to hear from any recent releases of the kind.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you all.\r\n\r\nConsul series is definitely something interesting,
    thanks for the link!\r\n\r\nAs to why I cannot use HTF Didot for this - main reason
    is the need to differ from the competition (magazines in the same field), yet
    I don't want to opt out from using Didones altogether. This is also the reason
    why I am looking for not just another Didot, but rather something with a little
    \"something\" - sorry for the lack of words here.\r\n\r\nAny opinions on [[http://typographica.org/2009/typeface-reviews/carmen/|Carmen

  body: I am expanding my search on any new releases of Scotch Roman/Modern kind of
    typefaces - so high contrast, even if not Didone, just to have a wider selection
    for testing. So any links are again very welcome.

    on Apud. I've come to love it, but I haven't yet found the right project to use
    it on. It's absoutely stunning, however. I'm dying to try this on an editorial
    project!\r\n\r\nAlso worth looking into Adobe Kepler. It's ENORMOUS. The display
    weights are a little on the even side, but it's definitely in the right family."

    very interesting, like Apud, Austin, Lavigne and Carmen. For this project though,
    it seems that the choice will be between Brunel and Consul. They offer me pretty
    much everything I need, so now it's time to do some testing.\r\n\r\n "

  body: Kiitos Tomi. I originally had the idea to use only finnish type foundries
    for this project, but the timetable doesn't allow for custom made typefaces. However,
    I do need other typefaces for this project as well, and will definitely keep in
    mind the great work you do at Suomi Type Foundry.
