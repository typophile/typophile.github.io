body: "I'm looking for capital and lowercase Js that you appreciate or find beautiful.
  I'm going to be flipping through my FontBook this weekend, but I'd love to see people's
  favorites, particularly from this self-selecting group of type- and visually-aware
  people.\r\n\r\nThe reason: a tattoo I'm in the early planning stages of. It'll likely
  be on my forearm, and will probably be incorporated into a larger design that will
  find its form based on the J itself. The J stands for something*, but that something
  won't influence the look of the tattoo, so it's not relevant to the typeface choice.
  I'm leaning towards a single color, and that color is black.\r\n\r\nMy inclination
  is towards the J as you see it here, rather than the script J as you'd see in, say
  <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=bello&x=0&y=0&sample_text=Jj\">Bello</a>
  or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_edwardian_script_std_virtual/?sample_text=Jj\">Edwardian
  Script</a>, but I certainly won't rule out interesting glyphs on that basis alone.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks for any suggestions.\r\n\r\n*No, not \"Jesus\"."

  body: The first thing that came to mind was a Didone like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/paratype/standard_poster_black_ot/?sample_text=J&sample_size=388">Standard
    Poster</a>, but Didone doesn't say "cool tat!" to me. Something more stylized
    like <a href="http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/index.html">Federal</a> or,
    if you're masochistic, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/paulus-franck-1602/">Paulus
    Franck 1602</a> might work. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/gotico-black/">Gothic</a>
    ... <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/gotisch-sb/">blackletters</a>
    are a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/steel-magnolias/">classic</a>.
    But if you really want to declare your font geekiness, why not take a 12pt bitmap
    of something like Georgia and enlarge it so you see the pixels, hinting and all?
    You can even have subpixel rendering! On your arm!
