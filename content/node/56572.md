  \ I'm not sure if this falls under the \"handwriting fonts\" talked about in the
  FAQ that are hard to identify.  Any help would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scars_5796.jpg]"

  body: "I think clearly the same situation applies to scribbled fonts as to hand
    printed fonts, so the FAQ applies. Whenever a font can be made by letters anyone
    can print by hand, and these certainly fit that description, then there can be
    countless varieties of them everywhere. \r\n\r\nA sampling of fonts that are often
    very similar can be found in [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg1.html|Part
    14]] of the Script Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Good work Jan. I didn't realize what the \"Trash\" category was under Script
    at Dafont. There has always been a 'gray area' about grungy styles at Dafont in
    my mind -- too many categories have potential for them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
