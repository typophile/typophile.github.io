  still very early days. Alot of the weights are still inconsistent and the descenders
  have not made up their minds yet...\r\nWould really appreciate any comments or suggestions...\r\nThis
  is attempt 1.5 at designing type (the first was a very confused lowercase which
  never made it even close to font lab)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    simply that the B was the most resolved of my caps.. '

  body: "It is hard for me to tell as a typeface without seeing text.  I wonder if
    you may need to revist the outlines when you start spacing. The lc \"i\" in particular
    is an often used letter. I wonder how it would feel in text? It may get lost both
    because of slope and size.\r\nYou also have to decide if you are going the route
    of brush lettering, with its more regular forms, or a more random handwriting
    look.  You seem to be somewhere between right now.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Mmmm, I love Mac's as well! Especially Copperhop, that is a real beaut! Seriously,
    you should approach Colenso bbdo in Akl, they might be interested in this sort
    of thing, as they 'do' the Mac's design.

  body: "Kris, the type is indeed for Mac's..\r\nStephen and Miss Tiffany, I have
    seen Black Jack before but in all honesty, I don't think they are that similar.
    Will be easier to see in context, so will try to post an update soonish..\r\nThanks
    for the comments."

  body: "What a good guess on my part! Do you have a pdf with the outlines, not rasterized?
    Are they getting you to digitise the lettering that they use already? Will the
    final be opentype, with lots of neat alternates and such?\r\n\r\nkris."

    it'd be interesting to get back in contact as I am now also a Design student and
