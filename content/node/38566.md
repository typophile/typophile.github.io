body: "Greetings friends,\r\nI'm in the beginning stages of a magazine re-design for
  Montana Outdoors, a small circulation (about 45,000, mostly U.S. and Canada) bimonthly
  magazine that focuses on Montana conservation and wildlife issues: http://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors\r\n\r\nWe're
  a small outfit, just an editor and myself, and I'd like to launch a new look next
  year, with better grids and a more effective and readable typeface for our body
  copy. We currently use Adobe Garamond 10/13, which I think is a little light, and
  perhaps a bit challenging for our older readers to read comfortably. \r\n\r\nI've
  only been in the magazine design business for five years, so I have much to learn.
  I'd like to transition to a more square typeface with a taller x-height. Utopia
  is pretty high on my list right now... I'll be pairing the body font with ITC Franklin
  Gothic condensed for our sans-serif / subhead choice.\r\n\r\nMy editor has asked
  me to survey the body text typestyles used by some of our peer magazines, who we
  view as the \"gold standard\" for us to strive for. Specifically, does anyone know
  at-a-glance what typefaces the following magazines use for body text:\r\n\r\nArizona
  Highways\r\nField and Stream\r\nAudubon\r\n(see attached samples)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help. If I can't find the answers, I'll do it the old-fashioned
  way and call their art departments!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arizonahighways_5839.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/audubon_3775.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fieldandstream_6501.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you both.\r\nIf you have any favorites you recommend for consideration,
    I'm open. I like the density and x-height of Utopia, which I see more in newspaper
    body, but it might look nice in a magazine spread..."

  body: "That's nice, a new free newspaper (like Metro) just launched here \r\nwhich
    \u2013 I believe \u2013 also uses ITC Berkeley. I don't know if I find it appropriate
    for newspaper use or not (I think not, actually), but I just wanted to mention
    it. ;)"

  body: If you'd like the large body but with more elegance, consider <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/presence_typo/classica/">Classica</a>
    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/presence_typo/alinea_serif/">Alinea

  body: "Can't go wrong with Utopia. It is one of the most readable fonts out there.
    Plus, I think its more casual tone would work perfectly with a publication targeted
    towards seniors.\r\n\r\nFor your accompanying sans, Franklin Gothic works well
    with Utopia, I've used that exact combination before. Not surprisingly, Helvetica
    Neue is also a safe choice with Utopia.\r\n"

  body: In my opinion both Franklin Gothic as well as Helvetica are pretty dull typefaces
    for magazines. They have been used to death for it. :)

  body: "I agree. Franklin is pretty common in magazines, and is certainly a safe
    choice, but I'm trying to keep at least ONE typeface consistent for a little familiarity
    to our readers.\r\n\r\nThe Alinea Serif that was recommended is just beautiful.
    I love the lower case g! It's just a little too pretty for our audience. I have
    to strike a fine line between readers who subscribe to Audubon and Nature Conservancey
    versus our sportsmen readers that pick up Field & Stream and Outdoor Life. \r\n\r\nI'll
    have to pick up Alinea for some freelance projects. It's just too nice to overlook..."

  body: You could also pick a typeface that has the same feel as Franklin, but is
    just a tad different in the details.
