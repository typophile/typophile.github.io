body: In the past, each time I have tried to package a file for back-up storage or
  transfer, it will only include partial font files in the output folder

  body: InDesign should include all the fonts, unless they have a no embedding tag,
    I don&#39;t think it will include those.  But I think that is only available in
    truetype fonts anyway. <BR> <BR> <BR>If you do want a list of fonts in the doco,
    however, you can find it at TYPE&#62;FIND FONT or FILE&#62;PREFLIGHT

    There was a bug in 2.0 that failed to package fonts properly. <BR> <BR>See <a
