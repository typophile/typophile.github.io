		<div class="commentbody">Somewhere around the Spring of 2004, while Googling some type related keyword, Typophile popped up as one of the hits. I don’t remember what I was looking for at the time but I became so enamored with the existence of a forum filled with type geeks that I just wandered about the place. Soon, I was hooked and signed up and got my T-shirt, screen name and an avatar—not the current one. I was particularly intrigued with the Critique Forum and was impressed with not only the work of Kris Sowersby, but the dialogue which ensued in the making of his now-released typeface. The whole experience rekindled my dormant interest in type design. I soon after began work on Leporello and posted it for critique. I am still thankful to all those who took the time to help me on my way.

Thanks to Joe and Jared for the reawakening!

There is a site upon the net 
They call it Typophile.
It’s been the ruin of many a poor son
And God I know I’m one. 

My Uncle was a printer
He taught me 'bout the type
I have loved the Baskerville
And you know that ain't no hype. 

Now the only thing a typehead needs
Is his FontLab and his Suite,
And the only time he’s satisfied 
Is when the curves are sweet.

Oh mother tell your children
Not do to what I have done.
To spend your life before the screen
Trying to make that notan hum.

Well I got one hand on the trackball
and the other on the keys 
and I’m going back to Typophile,
a-cryin' help me, help me please.

I stumbled on you twisted typesters while looking for some answers about aligning last lines on the page... You guys set me straight pretty quickly. 

The first night I must've spent easily 3 hours reading back threads, often not understanding much (especially Eben's threads) but getting a real kick out of the writing and arguing -- in particular, Hrant's comments. 

I have often thought of turning some of it into found poetry. Who can resist the word "bouma"? Especially << Bouma >> in guillemets?

		<div class="commentbody">I suppose I heard about Typophile at typographi.ca, but I cannot recall when. I only occasionally looked at the site. In July 2005 I was at the SHARP conference in Halifax and something I saw here spurred me to write a comment. I decided to join. But I was using a really crappy computer on a really slow hotel dial-up about 3 in the morning, and I kept getting some stupid-ass message that made me believe the action was not working. Since I had to give a talk in only a few hours I slammed shut the laptop and went to sleep.

The urge to say anything must have left, for I never thought again about making a comment until recently. So I tried to join up. I must have entered the same user name and password, because came back a note that led me to see I'd been a member since that night in Halifax. Who knew?

Glad to be here; very worthwhile. But I have very little to say to the world these days, so I doubt I'll add very much.

good night.

Lurked around for a while and finally posted my first post June 17, 2005. Time sure flies! Ever since my typomania has got worse and money spent on fonts and type books is increasing. I spend a lot of time here, and it sometimes affects my work and/or sleep.    
Thank you for existing! Typophile has helped me a lot and entertained me too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I see that next week I will have been a member for 5 years. I don't remember how I learned about Typophile. It might have been via Typographi.ca or the Typo-L list. I was heavily involved for a while in the beginning (much at the expense of other aspects of my life). 

As many of you know, I disappeared for a while a few years ago. Rumor was that I had checked into Typophile Rehab; but really, I just took on a very all-consuming creative director job for a couple years.

Now I've been making my way back on to the forums. But I find I don't have as much to say (or prove, perhaps?) as before. Still, I'm very glad Typophile is still around and going strong. I enjoy touching in now and again and keeping up with things.

Here's to many more great years of Typophile!

		<div class="commentbody">I was still at school and very interested in editorial design so I frequently browsed reading and learning about type on many now dissapeared small websites until one day I stumbled on Typophile. About four years ago.

I remember the first thread I read it was something about the future of type and the alphabet, it looked very interesting and there was this guy with a strange name making such radical propositions that made me post.

I remember some other notorius personalities that marched upon the typophile threads such as an excentric Italian printer who went to sail a couple of years ago, a birdwatching expert on dwiggings that who knows where did he flyed to and many others that still remain.

I'm thankful to typophile and oh god... I know... I'm one...

I'm a typoholic, (or as a close friend says "typophiliac"),so I was looking for a place where I could extend my knowledge of typography and font design. It was the first forum that popped up when I searched and here I remain and always will. Whether I've improved is debatable though.

My thanks to Joe, Jared, and all of you who are  involved with Typophile for giving us all a great forum for exhibiting and critiquing our work. Happy anniversary, and I look forward to many more.

I am inspired an hopeful, to the point that I've finally become serious about producing my first family of faces.

		<div class="commentbody">it might sound kind of silly, but typophile has changed my life. I had just started toying with building fonts and was wanting to do a revival of <a href="http://typophile.com/node/2733">Nymphic</a> by [[Hermann Ihlenburg]]. I came here for help and that started my [[typophilism]]. That was Jan 2004. i'm sure my following onslaught of questions was a bit annoying, but folks like [[Adam Twardoch]], [[Thomas Phinney]], [[Hrant Papazian]], [[John Hudson]], [[Tiffany Wardle|Miss Tiff]] and others were always willing to answer and educate me, for which i will always be appreciative (please forgive me if i didn't list your name in this short list). By the end of the year, I had quit my job and been taken on by [[P22]] as an intern for 3 months (a fortunate series of events). I've been at P22 ever since. At Typecon 2005 [[Jared Benson|Jared]] and [[Joseph Pemberton|Joe]] invited me to be a moderator at Typophile with my charge being to look over the newly-formed [[typowiki]]. I never really thought of becoming a [[type designer|typeface designer ]]before all of this, and now i forsee type continuing to be a large part of my future (likely for the rest of my natural life). thanks to all the guys & gals at [[Punchcut]] and to all of you who contribute here, you've enriched my life in ways you may never know.

p.s. and i've made some great friends along the way! who knew you could make <em>real</em> friends in a <em>virtual</em> community? y'all are the greatest!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've only been a member for only 46 weeks a I came across Typophile -I think- while googling for a font from Tom Hingston (Metro) that he had designed for the the metrolink tram system in Manchester. Beeing a rookie still, shortly after posting my first thread I made the mistake of asking if anyone could send me a outlined glyph of Nat Vignette for a tattoo I wanted. Now ofcourse I realise this kind of thing is a "big nono" here on Typophile, so thanks again, guys for not shunning me right away ;-)
I'm still merely a font admirer, but since I've been on Typophile, I've actually made a few fonts myself (obviously still very basic, but bear in mind that it's all a self-learning process for me). I can't imagine a day going by without taking a least a quick glimpse at Typophile. I simply love this site!</div>

I second how cool it is to have met so many personalities online, and then meeting people at conferences. But for me the best part about this site has been, the critique section, and having others keep tabs on all the great types around the internets (and posting links).

Thanks and happy birthday!

		<div class="commentbody">My story is a bit different from most.

I was relaxing in my hammock outside my jungle hideaway, where I often go to escape the wails of those women who cannot have me and the claws of those who currently do or have in the past, when I heard a blood-curdling scream from the direction of the river. One of my staff of spider monkeys reported in their curious glottal language that a pale and wan young man, while boating on the Amazon, had the misfortune of having half of his gluteus bitten off by a cayman.

I moseyed over to the riverbank to assess the situation and saw that the aforementioned fellow was barely clinging to life, having lost a fair amount of blood along with a significant portion of his sitting-down-parts. Realizing that time was of the essence, I placed the young man on the back of a gorilla acquaintance and sent him to find a tribal doctor before it was too late. Before they set off, though, I noticed the "Typophile" logo on the injured gentleman's t-shirt and, thinking it would somehow lead me to his friends or family, or anyone, for that matter, who would be able to cover the not-insignificant projected cost of his poultices and my (very expensive) time, I had one of my trained macaws research the word (I don't have internet access out in the jungle - satellite is just too expensive).

That injured young person, of course, is and remains Stephen J. Coles.

Yours most respectfully,

Joshua

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for saving Stephen, Joshua. I had thought that you were probably <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5420471247082411613&q=Dixon+Bainbridge+Boosh&hl=en">'a real live action man'</a> but that you kept on the Q.T. Probably by not growing a horseshoe mustache which might give you away. Well, it's clearly a secret no more!

I myself am just a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEQVJ50GZs"> 'tundra dweller' </a> as you know.

I found Typophile because I finally screwed up the courage to ask Jonathan Hoefler for help in learning how to make type. He suggested I start learning here. What a good suggestion that was!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I found Typophile after finally figuring out what the fonts were in a copy of the <em>New Left Review</em>: Scala + Sans. (The fonts proved to be more interesting than the contents of the journal, btw). I started looking for more information about Scala online, which search led me to a whole world of typophiles--including the big corner of it right here--and when I recognized myself, I fell in.

I registered on the site after winning the FontFont keyword database updating contest's grand prize in 2004, so I could post a public thank-you to the good folks at FSI and FS Benelux. (I still don't know how I did 800 fonts' worth; I think I needed some major off-time after completing my dissertation, and I was feeling a mite obsessive at the time.) But my speed and drive have turned to sloth, since I have yet to get around to making an avatar.</div>

I don't come here nearly as much as I should, or would like to, but it appears I've officially been here for a year and 27 months. However I think it's been longer as I'm sure I lurked for a while, being really quite terrified of type designers in general.

I may have come out from the shadows, though, when Armin Vit said something kind about me, like holding out a piece of typographic cheese to a shy cat. 

Now I flit in and out like one of those damned pets you suspect of only showing up when there's food.

There seems to be quite a few Finns here now. Considering the population of our country, we must be over-represented.</div>

Indeed! 

I am quite sure we would all appreciate & benefit from hearing your perspective on type, design, and whatever else you decide to write about. Cheers!</div>

That might explain my dual love for type and Formula-1.  :-)

		<div class="commentbody">Like an awful lot of people I first came here as a student looking for a Type ID. And also like an awful lot of people I was stunned by how quickly my request was answered! (Although after hanging around the Type ID board for a while since then, 24 minutes now seems actually quite slow.) 

I credit Typophile as really kicking off my love of type and helping it to bloom. It connected me into a community I otherwise would not have been able to find. It's been an incredible source of information and inspiration, and an ever present salve for those times when you "feel like you're the only one..." And it's also been a lot of fun.

Thanks to all of you for your words, your passion, your eccentricities, and your photos of your cats (where relevant to a thread's topic, of course). </div>
