body: "I am shortly going to be involved in assembling a very large volume of technical
  documentation to accompany a development proposal for a wind farm (very small by
  US standards but a big deal here in England). The amount of paper that this project
  will generate will be quite large: the Evironmental Impact Statement will in all
  probability run to at least 2,000 pages spread over multiple volumes.\r\n\r\nSince
  every consultancy has its own 'house style' I am trying to avoid this application
  resembling a mish-mash of various documents from different authors by suggesting
  we all settle on some standard fonts and conventions. There are a few problems here
  though:\r\n\r\n1. All consultants are using different versions of Windows;\r\n2.
  We have not retained a graphic designer;\r\n3. Our own 'house-style' is ghastly
  (10pt Arial for everything anyone?)\r\n4. There is currently no budget for font
  purchase and dissemination across the team.\r\n\r\nUsing just the Windows typical
  fonts, does anyone have any views about what would be the best to use for a standard
  font?\r\n\r\nI had thought about Georgia 10.5pt but I would like to hear from anyone
  with some experience on this sort of thing."

    there could be far worse options than use Georgia. I would pair a sans for headings
    and such.\r\nBut maybe you can find something a bit more condensed in the Cleartype

  body: 'Another serif that comes with office is Palatino. Best Version bundled with
    Office is Palatino Linotype. Book Antiqua is the same font, with a different name.
    However the versions should not be mixed, which is why a font selected from the
    new ClearType set is a better choice. '

  body: "Come on: 2000 pages and not a budget to license a typeface? How many workstations
    do you need? If there is no-one to sort out the chaos trail of multiple departments,
    agreeing on the typeface is not likely to salvage your sinking ship.\r\n\r\nBtw:
    For this kind of job, I'd look for something with a text size, a caption (and/or
    footnote) size, text figures and tabular figures, weights: regular, bold, italic.
    At least. Depending on the data, this might require even more.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Check the RFP (or RFT, or whatever). It's not unusual for things like font
    size, page margins, page count limits, and software version of deliverable files
    to be called out. (Here in the US, it would typically be section L, and sometimes
    M, in a government RFP). If they are, and you don't comply, you could be disqualified.
    If you're dealing with thousands of pages, you need to worry about the word processor
    more so than the fonts. Word will choke and die if you try to combine multiple
    documents from multiple authors (this is not Word bashing, just the facts). If
    the RFP allows you to submit PDFs instead of native files, leave your source documents
    in their native formats and combine them in PDF. Oh, and what about your pricing
    volume? Those are always the worst.

  body: "Do you expect the 2,000 pages to be printed despite the environmental impact?
    Related to this will the document actually be read by anyone? These questions
    will influence font and layout.\r\n\r\nAlso if the file will be distributed as
    a .doc or as a PDF then embedding non-standard fonts is viable (note TTF or OT
    TTF only in Word docs) \r\n\r\nAny way, the answer is Calibri 11pt.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for everyone's feedback. As a total newcomer to this sort of thing
    I appreciate any views.\r\n\r\nThere really is no budget yet for a professional
    designer to sort this out. \r\n\r\nThe EIA will be read by the Infrastructure
    Planning Permission - a relatively new body in England that determines national
    infrastructure projects. Because it is a new regulatory body there are no guidance
    notes available for the form and presentation of documents, beyond the blindingly
    obvious. The project will doubtless be highly contentious and so I expect large
    parts of the EIA to be read, despite its size.\r\n\r\nThank you for the point
    about Palatino Linotype and also potentially pairing this up with a sans-serif
    font for headings etc. I also appreciate the link to the Clear Type font page
    on Microsoft.\r\n\r\n@frode frank\r\nThe team currently comprises 12 individual
    consultancies. We have nominated a lead consultant to handle document control
    etc. but the overall 'look and feel' of all of the documentation has not been
    discussed to date, hence my request for some thoughts. I am not touting for free
    typographic or graphic design work, just some initial views so your point about
    sizes and weights is much appreciated."
