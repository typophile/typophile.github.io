body: "<strong> [[Indices]] : [[Foundries]] : Johnson & Smith Foundry of Philadelphia</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  Johnson & Smith foundry was a descendant of [[Binny and Ronaldson]], one of the
  first American type foundries. It was formed in 1833 when Johnson & Smith took over
  the James Ronaldson foundry. Johnson introduced [[electrotyping]] in Philadelphia
  and was a tireless worker. In 1843 it became the Johnson foundry after Smith's retirement.
  Johnson passed away in 1860 and the firm was taken over by his three partners at
  the time and became [[mackellar_smiths_and_jordan|MacKeller, Smiths & Jordan]] foundry,
  one of the most important American foundries of the 19th century. In 1834 the company
  published a specimen book showing the first American [[sans serif]] type in both
  [[upper case|upper]] and [[lower case]].\r\n"
