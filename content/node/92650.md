  have signed a contract with them, how can you be sure that they won't just outright
  steal it from you and claim they did it? You did all of (or at least most) the work
  for them already, after all. What if they ask for the FontLab file? I'm kind of
  leery about handing that over to someone, even if they are supposed to be reputable,
  before they've signed anything.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be a contract, but is
  there some kind of document that I can ask them to sign first, that will protect
  me?"
