  body: "Hi all, thanks for the input so far. \r\n\r\nChuck, I tried to ID selected
    characters on identifont.com but the orientation of the two diffent ends of the
    C wasn't an option (there were three choices: both vertical, both horizontal or
    both at an angle). \r\n\r\nI like the C very much too."
