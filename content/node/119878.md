body: Is there a rule-of-thumb for how much to stretch variants of a typeface? For
  example, if it's 75% as wide, is that condensed or ultra condensed? Or is it all
  simply relative to my own designs?

  body: "No rule of thumb that I know.\r\nWhen I condense a font I would usually use
    80% as my simple condensed. It's interesting to note that FontLab uses 80% as
    the default change in width in its action menu, but does not give it a name. BTW
    75% also is OK to call condensed without any qualifiers.\r\nDon"

    possibly be? Demi-condensed?\r\nDon"

  body: I'd guess 80% is close enough to 75% that you could get away with calling
    it 'condensed', especially if you're targetting print rather than screen.
