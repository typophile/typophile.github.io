body: "I made this font in December of 2013. It is not truly handwritten but has an
  artificial handwritten style (originally designed in Inkscape with the pen tool).
  I do release my fonts for free on such sites as Dafont...so I am aware they are
  not super professional looking. However, I would like to update my fonts -one at
  a time- and make them better.\r\n\r\nI want to keep the font true to its original
  style/personality, but I'd like to tweak it a bit and make it even better. I will
  definitely be improving the kerning.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any constructive
  feedback. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mf Hey Pretty Girl_5918.png]\r\n\r\n(I
  am not sure if I can attached or link to the font file itself for further analyzing?)"

  body: "It would be helpful, if you provided some text examples. I find your font
    interesting, here some advice:\r\n\r\n- The dots should be a bit bigger\r\n- make
    every lowercase distinct to its corresponding uppercase, this could be achieved
    by applying the x-height of the letter k to every other lowercase. The ascenders
    may be left at the current height"

    body: Also, I was wondering if you think I should bring the descenders up? They
      go slightly below the baseline, but I wasn't sure if they should descend lower
      or higher. Thanks again!

  body: "I like it, gives a sort of lilting rhythm to the otherwise unicase style.\r\n\r\nMay
    be worth looking at some letter widths. the W creates a lot of a gap in the running
    text right now, for instance."

    body: Thanks! I am not sure what you mean exactly? The lowercase w has to much
      of a gap?
