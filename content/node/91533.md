    designs. In this case, however, they DID use a font - albeit one of questionable
    provenance:\r\n\r\nBallistaDisplayScriptSSK  (and/or SSI)\r\n\r\nfrom the discredited
    Southern Software collection. Most of their fonts were clones or copies, but this
    one appears to be an original.\r\n\r\n - Herb VB"
