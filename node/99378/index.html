<p>Dear Folks,
Peace. My name is Manuel, I live in Northern Minnesota USA. For the past some 15 years I have been deeply involved in a study of  the so-called Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Torah. Not being Jewish by birth or culture, and being married to the daughter of a Cohen, even my wife found it weird that I would be given to study the Torah in any way. However, over the years she has come to understand (as have I) why exactly it is that I am involved in this endeavor. I found this group quite by fortunate coincidence this morning. I was looking for something to tell me if the Torah text included with DavkaWriter 7.0 was based on L. (Codex Leningradensis) or A. (the Aleppo Codex - now reformed into the Keter Torah)? And much to my surprise I found a link to a site (this one) that includes not only folks who are involved with the Torah and its textual basis(!) but typography as well! Both of which have now been very important in my life.
To give you a summation of my research:
I started out studying Dr. Jeffery Satinover&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Cracking the Bible Code.&rdquo; My wife and I had seen a book on the subject by one Michael Drosnin, and had decided though we both were chomping at the bit to read on the subject of &lsquo;Torah Codes&rsquo;, that book did not seem like it was the one to read, and some rather rough comments on his methodology turned us both away from Drosnin&rsquo;s work. We first found Dr. Satinover&rsquo;s book later that year fresh off the press at a local village bookshop. My wife read it in the better part of the first day and inquired of me if we had the means to try some experiments in a section of Exodus? I had an older (1917) copy of a JPS Tanach I had found years ago, tucked in my library of Biblical study materials. I did the work she requested and went on to research some things that I had been inspired to think on for some years. The story takes a bit of a turn from there. I got involved studying 42 letter lines initially (due to the legend of the 42 lettered name of G-d). But something (or Someone) kept nudging me that there was something I need to do&hellip; to go from two dimensional investigations to three dimensional bodies of text - but how? I soon found a project run by one Roy Rinehold who was publishing a Bible Code software, and was a C++ programmer. He was now forming a research group into the feasibility of doing a software to produce 3-d grids. I told him about something I had discovered that allowed me to view the Torah in three dimensions in VRML. But due to a very simple misunderstanding I was persona non-gratis when I discovered they were for all intents and purposes using the Torah to &lsquo;tell the future&rsquo; and produce all kinds of gobbledy-gook information. So much for that&hellip; from there I went it alone and though trying to make contact with someone or anyone who could understand what I was doing with the Torah text, most Jewish sources and Jewish Torah Code people I wrote or called or spoke with personally just sort of said &ldquo;well you are the only person we know doing this kind of work, so &lsquo;good luck with that!&rsquo;.
The process to understand what I did to view the text in its entirety in three dimensional presentation is simple enough: I took the total of letters - 304,805, and derived the largest cube root from the number - which by the way is 67 - making a cube of 67 letters, by 67 lines, by 67 plates (grids). Then I proceeded to continue the extractions next being 15, the next 8, the next 5 and the final 3, with three letters remainder.
Now, knowing that G-d, is not shrinking the Universe and that the Universe is in fact now being found in a state of very dynamic expansion = I reasoned that the Torah being traditionally the foundation of the Universe must start from the initial word and expand from there. Thus the remainder is really the beginning thus the word BR&rsquo;a of Bereshith must be the beginning and I would construct from letter one to letter 304,805 the series of cubes, from the smallest set 3, to the largest set 67. What this has led me to I need to share with people that can appreciate it! And that is why I came here.
You see, the next &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; I was given was to start finding matching pairs of letters on each line of text. How I did this was to find a middle and count out to each side and any letters matching at the same numeric placement on either side was to be highlighted. The first four grids are easy even the root 8 grids all I did was use the center space and mark either side each line. I call the process &lsquo;mirror-letter&rsquo; mapping.
When I first started I was using a copy of R. Aryeh Kaplan&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Living Torah&rdquo;, and desktop quadrille pads to do the largest of the cubes, the root 67 set. I then obtained the Bible Code 2000 software from CompuTorah in Israel, and later DavkaWriter. It was only when I started using the digital formatting that I was able to discover something absolutely amazing - the source of the images spoken of in the Kabbalah by the Sages of old.
And I can with assurance state here that Rabbi Moshe Cordevaro&rsquo;s proclaiming that animals and people and minerals and all the rest can in fact be located in the Torah text. And it requires the method I have explained to you here.
It is never written anywhere, or in any sefer that I have been able to find, where exactly to find the images in the Torah. But the descriptions are also found in the Tarot (which I now call the Taroh - and that for good reason), though in a bastardized form for the most part.
And what is more - The Taroh is also imaged in the Torah in its original form.
The images are formed very artistically by the pairs of letters - in a way I question as being done by any set of human Scribes.
Now lest you think I am ignorant of some of the more major details:
Yes this is not the original Alef-bet.
The two lines from Exodus that now reside in Numbers are another issue. - I do not think those that originally moved them knew of the images. I believe they were found after. My reasoning on this is that the timeline that now exists in the Torah, is NOT the timeline that existed prior and Kabbalah seems to point more to this arragement. They did quite literally change time, for themselves and for the world. And &lsquo;no&rsquo; I am not so impressionable as to believe &lsquo;everything I read&rsquo; - except when the &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; told me to do so.
There are &lsquo;holes&rsquo; that seem to evidence wrong word or phrasing choices by past editing which are evident throughout the text.
So, here I sit this morning the 5th of Jan 2013, hoping, somehow, someway, that I can dialogue with intelligent, serious minds that are more knowledgeable in the Hebrew language than me. And that I can have a conversation with and not encounter the &lsquo;deer in the headlights&rsquo; response or get some crass and mean response from.
Well, folks that&rsquo;s my story and I am sticking to it.
p.s. I have amassed a lot of illustrations from the text you see the final part is this: Though I set out to put the text into cubic structures (which I will as some point near term) I found that by just putting the grids from the first three letters to the last grid - one under the other (contiguously and in reading order) the images overlap. And one grid can provide many images. One such example is shown at <a href="http://www.colung-hernandez.com">www.colung-hernandez.com</a> - Please forgive me if I appear to be in anyway &lsquo;boastful or such&rsquo;, my purpose with the page is to provoke thought - I hope it does!
Respectfully yours,
Manuel Colunga-Hernandez

I apologize, age and trying to find glasses that work with my monitor have a way of messing with my writing in an onscreen setting.<br>
P.S.  I do have some examples of my typographical endeavors that I hope to post at some time soon for your input.  I used &lsquo;ScanaHand&rsquo; by the folks that make FontMaker software.  Allows you to write in handscript and convert it, save it as a .ttf.  I am now using a Linux-based OS so I am going to have to change my main font design studio.  The fonts include; a hand-done Samaritan font, and a numerical three digit rendering for each of the Hebrew letters, and a proto-Semetic face.  Some of my others are a font I use for notes and poetry that I named - Studio2a, and various hand done sketch works of faces I hope to digitize.
