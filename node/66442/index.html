Anti-aliasing.

That's sort of true.
Often character coverage trumps basic quality these days.

The step from regular to Bold in Verdana prime was tailored for low res. i.e. there was a extra specially large jump to make sure, (on 
Windows), that the rendering there would show it, or if aliased, there would be a large enough jump for a whole pixel. 

We put one step in between for other kinds of rendering, among other things.

Who needs all those different rendering options? Who wants to use horizontal scaling? Who wants to look thin or fat? The who's abound. ;)

Well yes, I know that.
That's what made the "Bold" in effect a Black, which
makes it great that you added a real Bold in between.

Kent: Yes, I certainly did look - but maybe I was unclear
before; when I said "that's not a Bold, that's a Black" I was
talking about the original Verdana.

Yes, I understood that. 

Your first comment opined that it would be great to have weights between Regular and Bold. I confess that I was unclear whether that was meant as an endorsement of the new approach (which includes a weight between Regular and Bold), or whether your use of the plural ‘weight<em>s</em>’ was a criticism of the new scheme (because it does not include *multiple* weights between the two).

DB seems to have understood the comment in the second way, asking you how many you think there should be. Your response seems to imply that his interpretation was right — although, I’m further uncertain whether your use of the term Demibold means that you think there should be another intermediate weight different from the Semibold, or whether you’re using that term interchangeably, or whether maybe you mean a Demibold should fall between the Bold and the Black weights.

So, I offer the waterfall to see if you do indeed think an extra weight should be added between the Regular and the Bold (in addition the Semibold).

Just to be clear, the Bold in the Pro development is the same as the original Bold.</div>

I'm REALLY excited about the idea of having a Georgia Pro too. Despite it's relative prevalence, I think that Georgia is such a nice typeface. Expanding it into a more dynamic family might make this Scotch Roman really get the attention it deserves.

yeah, i thought Tahoma's post was funny too.

@david berlow, kent lew, or whoever knows...

I'm left wondering exactly what the purpose of Verdana Pro is. It seems to very much be a reworking. It's a new family based upon and strongly resembling the old. (Correct me if you don't see it this way.)
In the wake of the IKEA episode, is it a proof-of-concept for a font that can work equally well onscreen and off?
Will it be available to license for linking with @font-face?
Will it ship with the next version of Windows and be licensed by Apple and therefore join the ranks of the "web-safe" as is Verdana amateur?

Verdana and Georgia aren't just fonts, they're a <em>brand</em> of font in and of themselves, with connotations attached that it appears the Pro versions don't have.
Or will they?

An expansion of a successful font family is uncommon for a leftist to wonder about.

>I hope Georgia Pro includes the hybrid figures...

No, but speaking of figures, there is an issue I promised to raise here:

Each of these families came originally with different default figures, old style proportional with Georgia, tabular lining with Verdana. To maintain compatibility, they are staying that way. 

Indesign, e.g. will then offer two other sets of figures to the user, for Georgia; lining tabular and proportional figs, Verdana; old style and lining proportional figures.

The issue is, that there is no label in InDEsign for what the default figures actually are, the user will have to know.

Is that okay?

Cheers!

It <em>is</em> a reworking. It’s not a “new” family; it’s an <em>expanded</em> family. Not “strongly resembling” the old, <em>built upon</em> the old. 

As far as I can tell, the four original styles remain essentially unchanged (weight, proportion, shape) except for the addition of glyphs, kerning, and OT features.

Much of the intention is outlined in Ascender’s press release announcing the project (you may need to filter the PR-speak): 
http://www.ascendercorp.com/pr/2009-09-08/

(Incidentally, the expansion was undertaken in advance of the Ikea flap. That news story just prompted the announcement, not the development.)

Answers to your other questions will probably have to wait. I’m not involved in the brief or the development or the licensing. I’m just privy to Betas in order to develop specimens for FB.</div>

Thanks for the explanation of what, it seems, Verdana Pro is. What it eventually does, we'll see, I guess. (I don't think I'll be springing for it, just to compare.)

Brand extensions almost never work out. If anything, they almost always end up diluting the brand image of the original in the minds of users.

Au contraire. There was no brand extension, they just introduced in a new locale. True, it didn't do too well, but it sold more Ch&eacute; posters than ever before. And look what it did for Mandy Patinkin's career just a few years later!
Political failure, followed by commercial success on Broadway. Go figure.
(I could try to run with a comic setup like that, but let's let it go...)

There is an interesting piece on the Harvard Business Review blog that I think may hold some insights for the business of fonts in the years to come:
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/research/2010/01/the-itunes-effect-and-the-futu.html">The iTunes Effect and the Future of Content</a>
And it relates to the discussion about weights on this thread.
Mark Jamra of Type Culture and I were talking at TypeCon. A couple of months before that I had bought a single weight of a particular font from Type Culture. He told me that it piqued his curiosity because it was unusual. The usual thing was for somebody to buy a complete family.
Now, I'm basically interested in using fonts within browsers, so what the heck am I going to do with all those weights? Hell, with some fonts, I even like the browser-synthesized italic better than I do the created one.
Anyway, as time goes on, expect to sell more singles and less albums. Seems to be a trend.

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding the price I think it's reasonable. Isn't a Font Bureau font usually selling for $40? Well 20*40=800. The prices announced here for the whole family are still a considerable discount, consistent with Font Bureau pricing. Thing is, even if they made the whole package for $80 no one is gonna buy it unless they need it! You don't go below a certain price. That will only lower the value of the product, that's a golden rule in retail :D

I think it makes perfect sense to be expanding the Classic Internet Headline Typefaces now that services like Typekit are about to take off. 
About to! A big problem is still the fact that most computers connected to the internet don't have an effective anti-aliasing engine (i.e. Windows XP: Although ClearType (Microsoft's Anti-Aliasing) can be voluntarily turned on and will make Headline typography look considerably nicer, you get things like radio buttons malfunctioning and other bugs) but I think that under the rough condition of aliased type, Verdana Condensed is likely to look less ugly than FF Dax or other 'print typefaces'. This is why that's a great time to be releasing this type family.

Ya, but I'm a big fan of "okay is not OK." There should be <em>some way </em> of indicating to the user what kind of figures the defaults are.

Verdanas place as a good rendering screen font is not dependent on hinting, (thank goodness).

Not really - The main difference between Verdana and Tahoma is the space between the letters. Nina is a narrower variant.

Exactly. I'm talking about the outlines. And since the bitmaps
behave comparably, I'm wondering how Trebuchet "got away"
with having a "normal" Bold.

The reason different hinting seems like a plausible explanation
is that Verdana's Bold is too dark in order to make the hinting
easier, right? At least that's what I remember reading back in
the day - and it makes sense, doesn't it?
