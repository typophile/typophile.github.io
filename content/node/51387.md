  body: I live in Texas and spend a lot of time driving between cities and staring
    at the back of semi trucks. These are way cooler than any of the mundane ones
    I am used to staring at, well until I pass them. Where are all these roaming?

  body: "Hey! Dat's really cool! Great idea and photos are well taken too.\r\n\r\nI
    do a lot of photoshooting on interesting typo while driving too. But it's it's
    not easy 'cause you are driving at the same time. The photos always turn out to
    be shaky due to the uncontrollable movement. "
