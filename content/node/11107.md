body: Double Drat! <BR> <BR>An uncomplete set of letters that I created. The inspiration
  is turn-of-the-century &#40;mostly from France&#41; posters, specifically those
  of Charles Loupot. Realizing the recent release of Mostra, I wanted to at least
  get these noticed and seen. They were created several months ago and owe nothing
  to Mostra, but everything to Loupot. &#40;That is not to say that I do not appreciate
  Mostra.&#41; One thing I do like about these letters is their imperfection. Feeling
  more hand-drawn as opposed to done on the computer using a grid and strict guidelines.  <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Regarding the imperfections, I&#39;m a sucker of  <BR>Rodchenko&#39;s
    stuff for the same reason. <BR> <BR>Good luck with it. '
