body: "There's been a recent discussion at my school on how to pronounce this font.
  Did a Google search and a bunch of different opinions came up. There seem to be
  three possibilities:\r\n\r\nka-LEE-bree\r\n\r\nKAL-ih-bree\r\n\r\nka-LIHB-ree \r\n\r\nNow,
  I personally say \"KAL-ih-bree\" but am wondering if it is actually \"ka-LEE-bree\".
  Does anyone know the OFFICIAL pronunciation? "

  body: "For the record, the pronunciations of the six Western font families introduced
    by Microsoft in the ClearType font collection, as their designers pronounce them:\r\n\r\nCalibri
    \u2013 kah-LEE-bree\r\nCorbel \u2013 kor-BELL\r\nCandara \u2013 kan-DAH-rah\r\nCambria
    \u2013 KAM-bree-ah\r\nConstantia \u2013 kon-STAN-tsee-ah*\r\nConsolas \u2013 KON-soh-lahs\r\n\r\n*
    Even within Microsoft, there are variant pronunciations. Although the designer,
    John Hudson, pronounces Constantia with a \"ts\" sound for the second <strong>t</strong>,
    I've mostly heard it as kon-STAN-tee-ah, with a simple \"t\" sound, and that's
    how I read it myself. (Perhaps this is just a residue of my having learned classical
    Latin pronunciation.)\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, the font name Segoe is usually
    pronounced sih-GOH within Microsoft, although the designer, Tom Rickner, named
    it after a street in Madison, Wisconsin, where it's pronounce SEE-goh. (The street
    was named after a city planner of that name.) But I've even heard people ask whether
    it should be pronounced SEG-way \u2013 which I suppose is a logical extrapolation
    from the musical term \"segue.\" That's the trouble with only <em>reading</em>
    a word, and not hearing it spoken.\r\n"

  body: So much for Times New Roman, then. Anyway, with the C-class, I tend to pronounce
    their names with emphasis on the first syllable. Very common in Icelandic, btw.
    Suspect that the other pronunciations are due to regional influences.

    either is fine. I pronounce it with the 'ts' sound because around the time when
    I was looking for a name for the typeface -- which had to begin with C, to fit
    with the other CT fonts -- I was singing some Gregorian chant and this word leaped
    off the page at me. So I pronounce it according to the liturgical Latin convention."
