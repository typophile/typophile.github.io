body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nthis has probably been discussed but I was unable to find
  an answer. Under OSX, is there a way to group OFT font families? For example, I
  have 49 weights and alternates of DIN and I'd love to have them show up in Illustrator
  under a family instead of having a huge list of fonts to scroll through. This is
  only an issue with some of the fonts I am using. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "The fix is to modify the fonts. In most cases large families like that are
    from commercial type foundries whose license terms don't allow end users to modify
    the fonts, so your only (legal) recourse is to contact the foundry and ask if
    they have a fixed version of the family, or are willing to fix it.\r\n\r\nI know
    of one fairly large family that is making such a set of updates right now, so
    I can attest that it does happen.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    be in Fontographer or is there a nice little utility to do this. If might be handy
    to combine some of these various script and dingbat fonts I have lying around.
    \r\n\r\nAs for the big commercial families, I'm glad they are starting to do that
    now and somewhat surprised that it wasn't done earlier."

  body: I wonder what exact version of DIN you are using (there are some from different
    foundries). For all I know, the FontFont DIN OTF version has always been grouped
    under a single family name, and the alternates aren't in separate fonts.

    I remember correctly.

  body: "Jens,\r\n\r\nit's my companies and it is FF and it isn't grouped. But I have
    a couple other big ones that aren't like Bryant and Whitney. I wonder if they
    were originally Windows OTF or something? That seems like it shouldn't make a
    difference. I'm using the old version of Font Explorer though I doubt that has
    anything to do with the way fonts are treated once loaded. \r\n\r\nI'm not actually
    using DIN right now but was playing around with some stuff so was digging around
    the library and came across this a couple times with various faces.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the tips."

  body: "<cite>... Windows OTF ...</cite>\r\n\r\nNo, that's not it, because there
    is no such thing. OpenType CFF fonts are inherently cross-platform, and were so
    when the format was invented.\r\n\r\nAt a technical level, this requires that
    the fonts make correct use of various name IDs in the name table. The details
    are pretty well understood by most font vendors.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I know of two versions of FF Din OTF were the alternates are listed and are
    not in the font. The first one is the TrueType version that includes a digital
    signature and shows an OpenType icon in Windows. This is an original FS version.\r\nThe
    second version are old PS fonts that have been converted into OTF. \r\n\r\n\r\n
