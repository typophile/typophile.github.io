  for girls. Basically, 1/2 the place is a retail store thats selling dolls, puzzles,
  etc & the other side is a dressup, karaoke for the kids who have parties.\r\n\r\nIts
  called bella club. \r\n\r\nI want you to critique my logo (so far). Black is probably
  not the final color.\r\n\r\n1- The diamonds represent a black & whote harlequin
  counter thats inside the retail area. Do you think the white is TOO white?\r\n2-
  Do you enjoy the outer glow? Will this be hard to quality control when in vector
  (e.g. printing errors, etc).\r\n3- Too adultish? Age group is 4-12. Mind you, the
  soccer moms are the ones paying for all this (higher income target audience).\r\n4-
  My clients are trying to add a crown to this. Do you think its missing something
  or do you feel its finished?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: "The first things I thought of, when I viewed the logo PDF, were, 'Las Vegas'
    / 'Casino' <em>( Maybe thats just me, but, Yea, I think it may be too 'adultish',
    if its, as you stated, intended for kids :)</em>\r\n\r\nI think this should rather
    be bright, colourful, and most of all, FUN\r\n<em>( Not as 'serious' as your current
    logo scribble would propose )</em>\r\n\r\nSomething 'happyhappyjoyjoy' :), playful,
    slightly 'girly'ish'\r\n<em>( A sample type recommendation may be '<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1129&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=DET0000142\"

  body: Agree with Dav, defintely not a logo for a kids club. Maybe you're taking
    the word 'club' far to serious. It needs to be kid like, cheerful, friendly, not
    'sophisticated' as the Bella.

  body: "I believe children (especially girls) enjoy the pretence that they are going
    to a sophisticated club so the script treatment is probably going in the right
    direction. That said the club bit doesn't work for me. And you are right about
    the glow, it is probably too risky unless you can control the print. The crown
    sounds a bit princessy to me although I suppose that would depend on the treatment.\r\nTim"

  body: "Not sure if they have <a href=\"http://www.clublibbylu.com/\">Club Libby
    Lu</a> in your area. Their logo has the crown your client is pushing for. Also
    a very \"girly\" typeface, like Dav is recommending. \r\n\r\nIf Club Libby Lu
    is a direct competitor, what you've created <em>might be</em> appropriately different
    from the \"expected\" treatment.\r\n\r\nBlack and white are probably a bit too
    sophisticated for little girls. And I'd lose the glow/shadow due to the control
    issues you've mentioned. It does look a bit \"Vegas\" to me, also. But then again,
    not all little girls are into pink ponies and princesses. If the store has a more
    Old Hollywood glamour feel to it, this kind of treatment might work. "
