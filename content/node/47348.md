body: "any idea what could be the cause that hinting (fontlab autohinting + AFDKO)
  \"hides\" (blanks) the ffi ligature in one of my fonts? \r\n\r\nWhen I hint my font
  and then export it to opentype postscript-flavoured, the ffi-ligature glyph is just
  white. all other glyphs work fine.\r\nWhen I don't hint at all, the ffi glyph is
  visible as well.\r\n\r\nI just tested in Indesign CS2 until now, but maybe someone
  knows what could be the cause for this?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSebastian"

  body: Does the glyph have any outline overlaps? Are the outlines in the correct
    direction? Have you tried running CheckOutlines?

  body: I have had the same problem with a couple of glyphs one time. I believe my
    problem had something to do with startpoints, cos when I set them to left lower
    corner everything worked fine again.

  body: "Thanks Goran, I changed the \"first node\" setting, now it works fine.\r\n\r\nMiguel:
    Yes, there were overlapping forms (i had this problem with \"ffi\" and \"n\" now)
    but I reduced them to one form before applying hinting."
