  corporate face. The current versions aren't holding up well on devices and on the
  web.\r\n\r\nAnyone have experience with this? Are there any good case studies out
  there? I'm just really looking for a bit of background\u2014I'll need to do some
  convincing in house first before going to a foundry. Thanks!"

  body: "Apart from the obvious question, is the corporate font theirs (ie. they own
    it outright) or is there a font foundry or designer who can claim ownership over
    it? The first thing to determine is what 'screen' or 'screens' they want to target.
    Windows, Mac OS, Flash etc., as the approach to tuning will vary depending on
    the output device/s. Next up would be to ask if the screen tuned version needs
    to be metrically compatible with their existing fonts. It would also be worth
    analyzing the quality and hinting-suitability of their existing outlines, as clean-up
    prior to hinting may be needed. With this information you can determine the scope
    of any re-drawing and hinting. \r\n\r\nAs for case studies there have been various
    workshops and talks at TypeCon and ATypI on this. Might be worth trying to dig
    up the presentations related to this."

  body: "I would be inclined to do some independent research on the original vendor
    - do they have a track record of producing screen-hinted designs? If not they'll
    likely sub-contract out to someone (individual or company) that does hinting,
    so you might be better to go direct and cut out the middle-man - not for purely
    financial reasons, but also to have direct contact with the people doing the work.\r\n"
