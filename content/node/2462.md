body: Hi there, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve a quick query about a typeface I designed about
  a year ago &#40; <a href="http://www.overnightdesign.co.uk/aerobic" target="_blank">http://www.overnightdesign.co.uk/aerobic</a>
  &#41; <BR> <BR>It was my first stab at a full character set so I though I&#39;d
  build a small site around it and let folk download it if they wanted. There was
  no copyright information on the site or in the zipped font files. So far so good
  . . .  <BR> <BR>Then the other day I noticed a post on a news board about a club
  in the states  &#40; <a href="http://www.crobar.com" target="_blank">www.crobar.com</a>
  &#41; that had just been re-branded &#40;posted by the guy who designed the new
  logo&#41;. This new identity basically consists of the word Crobar set in aerobic
  &#40;my typeface&#41;. I checked that they were both the same and found the match
  to be pretty much perfect. <BR> <BR>What irritated me was not that the designer
  in question had used the font as part of the logo but that he had simply used the
  typeface and added nothing to it, passing it off as his own work and hadn&#39;t
  dropped me a line to ask if it was ok to do so. <BR> <BR>Do I have any kind of ownership
  of intellectual property or anything over my work or was this  wavered when I made
  the face available for download on the site. <BR> <BR>Sorry if this seems like a
  bit of a whine but it irritates me to think that another person is essentially passing
  off something I spent a considerable ammount of time on as their own. <BR> <BR>Any
  advice welcome. <BR> <BR>Barrie <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22630.gif"

  body: As far as I know, contacting the designer is a good practice, but, since you&#39;ve
    said it yourself that you didn&#39;t have any copyright information or usage restrictions
    on the site, or even a readme file in the zip archive, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s
    much you can do. <BR>By having none of that info on your site, you basically implied
    that the font was free for the taking and that any usage would be okay. At least
    that&#39;s the message I get.

    work. <BR>The logo is his. <BR>Think of all the logos which are just a word, set
    in a particular face - are the designers of those logos cheating the type designers?'

  body: You might check out the License Agreements from some other foundries if you
    want to keep this from happening again. There are foundries that restrict this
    sort of usage of their fonts. Emigre &amp; House come to mind, but IIRC P-22,
    AGFA, and Typofonderie also have clauses dealing with this.

    <BR> <BR>Hey, nice! <BR> <BR>I think your best bet is to appeal to common decency.
    And although Steve is right that a logo that uses a font has no legal obligation
    to the font, giving credit <i>somewhere</i> &#40;especially for purely typographic
    solutions like that one&#41; is good, and it would be decent if the guy did that.
    Otherwise there&#39;s the stigma that&#39;s he pretending it&#39;s <i>all</i>
    his. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    not true. Copyright law exists on the web as it does on paper. However, your sight
    clearly says &#39;no copyright&#39; so maybe you should be a bit more explicit
    as to what you want your license agreement to be. I did notice your readme file
    says &#39;for personal use only&#39; so I think, technically, you&#39;re in the
    right. YOu just may want to make that a bit clearer on your actual page.'

  body: I am a bit lost, so is there an obligation if I use Meta Black and make a
    logo for &#39;Mister Twister Lemonade&#39; for me to somewhere state that I used
    Meta? Can it be explictly stated for me to do so? Doesnt the fact that I paid
    for the license to use the typeface for that job enable me to use that typeface
    for that job without credit? Must I edit the type in the design? Furthermore,
    did editing Fr. Gothic get around this &#39;clause&#39;?

  body: 'I love the font and the website...it&#39;s rad! <BR> <BR>As for the copyright,
    you do have copyright for things you create &#40;and I&#39;m almost positive that
    even by adding a stylistic &#34;No Copyright&#34; to your site doesn&#39;t erase
    this&#41;. However, I think that because he has created something as well, it
    would be considered a new work and therefore have its own copyright. It&#39;s
    like collage art: the new piece is considered its own creation even though it
    contains the elements of other copyrighted works. However, there have been many
    cases where the use of a single item as the major feature of a work has led to
    copyright violation, so this might be the case with your situation. Unfortunately,
    this would be a situation that rides the fence and might need to be taken to some
    sort of judicial proceeding to actually get sorted out. <BR> <BR>'

  body: It is a special case in that it&#39;s a typeface, which doesn&#39;t have quite
    the same copyright protection that drawings, photographs, and stories do. If you
    had put any of those things on your site and someone made a derivative work from
    them, that would be a violation. To be realistic, if you say a font is free to
    use, you have to expect people to set words in it for design purposes, otherwise
    what is a font for? <BR> <BR>But, venturing out of the realm of the question asked
    and into the minefield... I can tell a difference between the two. The crobar
    weight is slightly lighter and there are a few subtle proportional differences.
    And don&#39;t hate me for saying this, but it&#39;s made of circles. Parallel
    invention of simple forms such as these cannot be ruled out. There is a good possibility
    that they never saw your typeface.

  body: Great Flash work. Kudos on the font too. Suxors on the licensing bit, but
    I think you can learn from the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4102/2895.html">Broadcast
    Licensing</a> post Eduardo mentioned. &#40;Even though your situation isn&#39;t
    totally parallel with Stuart&#39;s, you still have the &#34;for personal use&#34;
    clause to hang onto.&#41;

    <BR>Hrant, that would definitely be a very decent thing to do but highly unrealistic
    to expect. Like Tayo, I don&#39;t think designers should feel obligated to credit
    anywhere on the client&#39;s end what typeface was used for a certain logo '

  body: 'In some instances giving the typeface credit is unrealistic. In regards to
    the clauses in some EULAs, I choose to read between the lines by listing the fonts
    used when the opportunity is available.  <BR> <BR>However, I think that there
    should be more colophon&#39;s in catalogs and brochures, as well as annuals and
    books. Perhaps it is not always appropriate, good enough. BUT ... I think design
    annuals are guilty of not making this mandatory. If for not other reason that
    to help the young design students that dig through them. <BR> <BR>Barrie. Doing
    anything retroactively is difficult, unless of course you have your own stable
    of lawyers. I would suggest the same as others have and attach a EULA to your
    typeface with a personal use clause, or perhaps some other kind of clause that
    at minimum gives you the opportunity to see the work being created with your typeface. '

  body: I think there&#39;s a confusion here between assessing the fairness/legality
    of the Crobar logo, and assessing the designer&#39;s skill.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    no question that the use of Barrie&#39;s font is legal. There was no EULA stating
    otherwise, and there&#39;s no law that prohibits a designer from using a font
    as-is in a logotype. <BR> <BR>Barrie seems to feel that it was lame of the designer
    to not adjust or customize anything. Fine, but that&#39;s just a judgment of the
    designer&#39;s skill and of the finished product -- no legal issue is involved.
    Besides, it&#39;s conceivable that the &#34;as-is&#34; logotype might be the best
    solution for the project. It wouldn&#39;t make sense to have to alter the type
    just for the sake of altering the type. <BR> <BR>&#40;On another topic, I wholeheartedly
    agree with Tiffany about encouraging the use of colophons in publications. I&#39;m
    always disappointed when there&#39;s not one.&#41;

  body: That being said, if you agree to a contract that says you&#39;re going to
    things in a certain way -- which is what a EULA is -- and then you fail to abide
    by the contract, you&#39;ve just given the foundry grounds to sue you and otherwise
    hold you in brach of that contract &#40;your right to use the font at all may
    be terminated, for instance&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you &#42;really&#42; don&#39;t like
    the terms of the EULA and/or don&#39;t think you can abide by them, you shouldn&#39;t
    license the font. Once you&#39;ve agreed to it, it doesn&#39;t matter whether
    the EULA seems reasonable, you&#39;re in a contract. <BR> <BR>At least, that&#39;s
    my non-lawyer&#39;s understanding. As usual, you shouldn&#39;t take this as legal
    advice; if you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer. Etcetera. <BR>
