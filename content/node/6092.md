  Logo"> <BR> <BR>It is for an art gallery. The shape is meant to reflect the three
  characteristics of the gallery: art &#40;brush stroke&#41;, global outreach &#40;globe&#41;,
  modernity &#40;@ sign&#41;; also, the letters WWA are somehow meant to be in there!
  <BR>comments welcome! <BR> <BR>Greetings, <BR>s'

  body: Saman, first reaction to the mark I thought It was a womans womb with child.
    Tell us more about WWA do you show art of the world or sell local artists world
    wide. My only other thought is art is free flowing and creative not static and
    justified like your type. Start again but this time use a pencil to paper and
    let your creativity flow. The computer has your thinking to rigidly.

    again and start with pencil on paper. A few comments on the client, WWA. World
    Wide Art is an art gallery selling both antiques and modern art pieces from around
    the world - everything from sculptures to carpets to paintings.  <BR> <BR>Any
    more comments anyone?

  body: Saman make your look more universal, I thought it was only paintings. Maybe
    it needs a tagline to give it the scope it needs.

  body: I think you are / were trying too hard to implement and include as much meanings
    and characteristics into the symbol as possible.. <i>&#40; At least according
    to your description.. &#41;</i> <BR>Which is / was, proably, a bit too much..
    <BR> <BR>Maybe you should try to focus on one thing instead, and try to simplify
    your logo.. <BR><i>&#40; Hmm, sounds way easier than it may be, then.. &#41; <BR>
    <BR>By the way, Welcome to Typophile, Saman.. Another fellow Austrian..</i>
