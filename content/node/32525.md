  body: "Like in Latin typefaces, there's always more than one (correct) way to do
    it. Greek has various regional preferences, epoch preferences, and traditions,
    so it will be impossible to please everyone.\r\n\r\nHere's how Garamond Premier
    Pro (left) and Arno Pro (right) were done:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gpp_arno1_4409.png]\r\nIota
    adscript (prosgegrammeni) is the default, and iota subscript (ypogegrammeni) is
    implemented via a Stylistic Set.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gpp_arno2_4279.png]\r\nAll
    are Stylistic Alternates (salt). In Garamond Premier, the theta, kappa and phi
    alternates are also grouped in a Stylistic Set. In Arno, theta and kappa alternates
    are in the same Stylistic Set, and pi and phi alternates have their own Stylistic
    Set each.\r\n\r\nNotice how the default form and the alternate form of some letters
    differs, depending on the style (upright vs. italic) and the typeface. These decisions
    \u2014 design and implementation \u2014 were made by Robert Slimbach.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gpp_arno3_4873.png]\r\nThe
    kai alternate is only present in 'salt'."

  body: "BTW, we stopped putting the final sigma (\u03C2 U+03C2) in the 'fina' feature,
    as it confused/annoyed people every time they had to type a word containing a
    sigma (\u03C3 U+03C3) in the middle. And that didn't help the users anyway, because
    the final sigma has its own keyboard key, which they use. "

  body: "My $0.02, based in part on having followed some of the debates about various
    Unicode proposals relating to some of these glyphs:\r\n\r\n2. Lunate (C-shaped)
    Sigma/sigma is specifically an ancient/medieval form, so as you say it is beyond
    merely \"quaint\" - it could be put in \"hist\" in addition to \"salt\" if you
    wanted, but there are so many different historical periods represented in Greek
    type that OT's simple \"present vs. past\" distinction is too simple, perhaps.
    Curly (omega-shaped) pi is also defunct (medieval/early modern) and probably belongs
    in \"hist\" if you create that feature.\r\n\r\n3. Your uppercase Stigma there
    is really more of a cursive Digamma, but it hardly matters, because the only place
    where Stigma is needed in uppercase is for numerals, where stigma and digamma
    merged long ago anyway. You could make it a quaint \"dlig\" in lowercase if you
    want, but I wouldn't do it in uppercase.\r\n\r\n5. The kai ligature doesn't need
    a grave accent because that's sort of assumed in the ligature.\r\n\r\n6/7. The
    omicron-upsilon ligature is still found occasionally in casual handwriting, more
    than stigma as a ligature certainly, but it's more like Comic Sans rather than
    polytonic in its modern usage.\r\n\r\nAlso, I might be inclined to swap the tall
    phi for the script phi. The tall form is not standard in modern Greek, but to
    my eye, it looks less out of place in such a plain sans font than the script form
    does, especially when the rest of the stylistic set is script forms. This may
    just be my Porson-trained bias, though; I'd be curious to know what native Greek
    speakers think about this."

  body: "The question of whether the adscript or subscript mute iota should be the
    default depends on who your primary market is. Most publishers outside of Greece
    will be dealing with classical and Biblical texts, and the preference in the user
    communities is for the adscript. Within Greece, there seems to be a preference
    for the subscript form.\r\n\r\nI agree with Archaica's observations about the
    archaic variant forms, the lunate sigma and scribal pi.\r\n\r\nI might put the
    lowercase stigma in the dlig feature, but not the uppercase. The uppercase Stigma
    is a recently invented casing form for the lowercase, without historical basis.
    It exists to fill a hole in the use of Greek letters as numerals, but other than
    that it should be avoided.\r\n\r\nNo, I don't think the kai should be substituted
    for the Latin ampersand. For better or worse it has its own Unicode codepoint.\r\n\r\nYes,
    if you're going to include stigma in the dlig feature then omicron-upsilon would
    be a reasonable addition. These two are the longest lingering of the once extensive
    Greek ligature set. I've even seen them in graffiti in Thessaloniki. Regarding
    the application of accents to the omicron-upsilon, yes this certainly can be done
    (Granjon did). The assumption has to be that this ligature always represents the
    diphthong, so the accent is always on the upsilon, not the omicron."

    what he has done also. So you're in good company.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the showings
    of Greek sets in the big Ensched\xE9 book include the omicron-upsilon ligature
    at the end of the basic character set, not among the ligatures. As a representation
    of the diphthong, it has a status approaching that of an independent vowel."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GrAlts1_6199.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm puzzled
    by this.\r\nAccording to Unicode, \r\n03B8 = GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA\r\n03D1
    = GREEK THETA SYMBOL: script theta, used as a technical symbol\r\n\r\nAnd yet
    in the Italic of some fonts, 03D1 is less scripty than 03B8 (see above).\r\nThis
    toggling of style seems to be putting a stylistic alternate at odds with Unicode.\r\nLooking
    at both Adobe Pro and Cleartype fonts, the treatment of italics appears to be
    inconsistent by both companies, with some typefaces having the closed forms of
    alternates such as theta as 03B8, and the script variants as 03D1, and some the
    other way around -- which is more consistent with Unicode, IMO (the same applies
    to phi, beta with descender, and the \"latin\" kappa). Like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GrAlts1b_3755.jpg]\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it occurs to me that in the upright font, perhaps 03D1 could be oblique, as the
    technical symbol could be full script (like the litre symbol), and the variant,
    <em>upright </em>open form designated as 03B8.alt. Does that make sense?\r\n\r\nIn
    my own italic fonts, I am considering making the default in the open script form,
    as I prefer that for those faces, and making the \"variant\" character the same
    glyph, as that seems to be more consistent with Unicode (see below). After all,
    if the technical symbol is called for in the italic font, and it doesn't look
    scripty, surely that is wrong.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GrAlts2_3869.jpg]"

  body: "There is no requirement to use the \"scripty\" theta as the italic default
    form. My understanding is that it depends on the typeface. Garamond Premier Pro
    has the \"scripty\" theta as the default form in the italic, but Arno Pro does
    not. This was the designer's deliberate decision.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the
    (default) form for U+03D1 needs to be the \"scripty\" one, as it was decided by
    Unicode. This should apply to both the roman and italic styles, . Arno Pro follows
    this convention."

  body: "<em>My understanding is that it depends on the typeface.</em>\r\n\r\nAgreed.
    As I mentioned, I preferred the scripty Italic 03B8 theta etc for the faces I'm
    working on, not that it was mandatory. \r\n\r\nMy query was prompted by what appears
    to be the non-scripty 03D1 in italic fonts such as Garamond Premier which you
    showed above. It looks like (in Microsoft's <em>Now Read This</em> specimen) that
    Calibri, Candara, and Corbel are similarly configured -- although not Constantia
    or Cambria."

  body: 'Yes, I think your approach is correct Nick: the more cursive form should
    be default for U+03D1 regardless of what the default form of U+-0B8 for the particular
    typeface is. In the CT fonts, we didn''t do this, because we were maintaining
    a largely identical glyph set between the styles, but probably should have; on
    the other hand, I''m not expecting people to use the U+03D1 codepoint. If one
    follows Adobe''s one-glyph-per-character rule, then your approach may require
    the addition of an extra redundant glyph in italic fonts, if you want to provide
    the oval theta as a variant.'
