  well I don't read too many. I have a friend and client who is a pro blogger. She
  does blogs for TV and Film companies. I prefer photos, they say more than words.
  So I tried a bit of bloggin just to keep a central location for many links I like
  to visit. \r\n\r\nIf I need to say something I can say it here. \r\n\r\nI finally
  have a place to show the first Comedy based on Comic Sans that was filmed for Channel
  4's show This is a Knife back in April. \r\n\r\n"
