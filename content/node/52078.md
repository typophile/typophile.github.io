  someone digitising type on Ikarus M, something like these <a href=\"http://typeclub.com/2008/03/15/jim-rimmer-and-the-pie-tree/\">pictures
  of Jim Rimmer working on <em>Stern</em></a>. Does anybody have access to (an) image(s)
  I would be allowed to use? I need at least 500 pixels width, height is less important.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    Or Rich -- maybe he has access to the Jim Rimmer pictures.
