  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">well, it says &#34;anything goes&#34; and since people do seem to enjoy one or the other non-quite-type-related-thread on this board, i was wondering, what liquid goes best with designing typefaces. it&#39;s a personal choice, of course, which might make this thread as interesting as &#34;What&#39;s your desk, studio etc look like?&#34;. at least i hope so. <BR>for me it&#39;s basically fresh ground italian coffee &#40;Saquella&#41; and natural french mineral water &#40;Vittel&#41; during the day. but if i&#39;m still in front of the screen after the sun has left the building, i tend to grab something &#34;more enlightening&#34;. in my case that would be either beer from eastern europe &#40;Budweiser or Pilsner Urquell&#41; or red wine from spain or preferably from northern italy, depending on the weather and mood. btw, i&#39;m german and live and work in hamburg, so my poison is not as sophisticated as it might look to people on &#34;the other side of the pond&#34;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Years ago, at my first ATypI conference, Dave Farey explained to me the correlation between the italic slant angle and the number of glasses of wine consumed by the designer. <BR> <BR>During the day, I usually have a glass of water handy &#40;next to the bag of double salt licorice -- they sort of cancel each other out in the system&#41;, but in the evening a glass of wine is not uncommon &#40;usually a shiraz or shiraz blend, usually Australian&#41;, and if I&#39;m still working at a later hour I have a scotch &#40;usually Lagavulin, always single malt, never less than 12 years old - because some snobbery is good snobbery&#41;. I tend not to drink coffee while I&#39;m actually working: if I need to stay up all night to meet a deadline, I find chocolate covered espresso beans to be more effective. But coffee is <i>very</i> important in other ways, so once or twice a day I leave my desk and walk to <a href="http://www.caffeartigiano.com/">this place</a>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">During the day, at the office: copious amounts of Hinckley Springs water and equal amounts of some wretched institutional coffee or other.  <BR> <BR>At night, at home &#40;or with the laptop out and about&#41; it&#39;s generally booze, punctuated by periodic intakes of water. Scotch rocks is the perennial favorite. Arbeg, Laphroaig, or Lagavulin &#40;in order of preference&#41; are the favorites. Usually it ends up being something like Dewar&#39;s or Ballantine&#39;s however. Unlike the esteemed Mr. Hudson, I prefer the 10 year Laphroaig to the 15. <BR> <BR>Beer comes in a close second. Old Style &#40;the mainstay of Chicago&#41; tops the list. Singha takes silver, with anything Polish &#40;Tyskie, Dojlidy, Okocim&#41; going home with bronze. <BR> <BR>And since I hear it&#39;s better for the ticker, I&#39;ll throw an odd bottle of wine in here and there. Typically Chileans &#40;Gato Negro or Concha y Toro&#41;. I finally gave up my grad school obsession with 3-liter screw-top jugs of Livingston Cellars ;-&#41;</div>

At the market I go to in Chicago, the advertising is minimal - most of the beer&#39;s sitting in cardboard boxes. Frankly I prefer Okocim&#39;s Porter - Dojlidy beats their lager hands down. Okocim Mocne is quite a drink too - and packs quite a punch. The other Polish brew I like, my favorite in fact but which I can&#39;t find anywhere in Chicago, is Kosher.

I was on my Amiga 500 &#40;running Fog 3.1 under MacOS emulation&#41; in my little appartment in Barcelona, designing a geometric Armenian font &#40;hey, I was young&#41; deep into the night, when, under the influence of nothing but sleepiness, I started drifting in and out of sleep, but never stopping to push the beziers. Finally I had to stop, and barely managed to crawl into bed, but not before I hit Save and shut down. The next morning I went back to the font, and saw a really strange Jeh indeed... It was partly garbled, but somehow it still must&#39;ve made sense, in some ethereal dimension. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a source for the real thing, although I&#39;ve only tried it once. It really isn&#39;t a strong hallucinogen, as many people believe, unless you were to drink a lot of it &#40;I had about two fingers, straight, and didn&#39;t see anything unusual except a man sitting next to me playing a ukelele, but he turned out to be real&#41;. The impressive thing about absinthe is the apparently perfect balance of the depressives in the alcohol with the stimulants in the wormwood. <BR> <BR>You can make your own laudanum very easily if you have the poppies. A lot of perfectly respectable people in Victorian England made their own. <BR> <BR>I should point out that I&#39;m not a drug user, and never drink with the intention of getting drunk.

Mind you, conferences are one of the few times I&#39;ll indulge--gotta deal with the lack of sleep somehow! <BR> <BR>Outside of that environment, caffeine free diet Dr. Pepper is a favorite, when I can find it. Although I like Guinness straight up, I&#39;m also partial to a 3:2 mix of Guinness and Henry Weinhard&#39;s vanilla cream soda. It&#39;s got to be really good stuff, mixing Guinness with cheap soda pop is truly awful. &#40;Isn&#39;t that a great straight line for somebody?&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also fond of ginger beer. <BR> <BR>But to be honest, most of the time when doing design work, I just drink water.
