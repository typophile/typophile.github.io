  you have a quite sophisticated font mapping feature. This is very useful: some font
  packages are so designed that you dont get a true, say, italic, just by pressing
  ctrl i. You have to actually select the italic variant, which is very tiresome anf
  time consuming. An example of this is Zapf Renaissance.\r\n\r\nIn WP you can go
  to font mapping and select the font you want whenever you select italic etc. The
  process is thus automated.\r\n\r\nDoes such a process exist in Word of any vintage?
  I use 2003 if I have to use Word and have not found a similar feature\r\n\r\nJohn"
