  body: I'm afraid I can't help you with that. It looks familiar but I just can't
    find it.

  body: "Unfortunately, the banner sample (\"The Consortium\") is the new rage style,
    apparently, and that is a sort of slightly squared humanist Sans style. The list
    of these fonts grows daily, but it includes Soho Gothic, Ubik, Stainless, Klavika,
    Gesta, and on and on. You can search using 'squarish sans-serif' at MyFonts and
    get a long list of them. However, I didn't think any of these looked right. [Note:Soho
    Gothic is at Fonts.com]\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that this is [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_form_sans/formSansMedium.html|Foundry
    Form Sans]] with a modified 't', but the samples on that site are not good enough
    to be sure.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have a better idea about it?  Are there any other
    samples of this, showing other letters?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I think a rounded Foundry Form Sans with a modified 't' is spot on. Cf. [[http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/getty2.gif|this]],
    linked by Hrant to a previous ID request, as a sample.
