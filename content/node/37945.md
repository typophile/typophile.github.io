  their fonts. They have customized Helvetica Neue fonts, like \"IBM Helvetica Neue
  Black\". How does that work license-wise? I doubt they just made a rip-off and renamed
  it, to avoid licensing fees. \r\n\r\nDo any of you experts here know anything about
  this kind of stuff? I'm interested because I myself might someday like to do somehing
  similar. "

  body: "Well, I'm no expert, but my assumption is that they had to talk to Linotype
    (whom I believe owns the rights to Helvetica Neue) to get permission to customize
    and modify the typeface. Most standard [[EULA]]s have a clause prohibiting modifying,
    renaming, etc., unless express permission is given, so they probably had to work
    out some deal (which I'm sure wasn't a big deal money-wise for a company like
    IBM).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, though, renaming/modifying type without permission
    is not as uncommon as you'd like to think, even for big companies. I've seen a
    few such cases here on Typophile if memory serves, with the most famous recent
    case being the one <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/17362>here</a> and <a
    href=http://www.typophile.com/node/14517>here</a>."

  body: If the derivative font contains the trademarked name of the original, in this
    case Helvetica, you can be pretty confident that it's licensed, especially when
    someone like IBM is involved. Check the (c) and TM strings in the font for confirmation.
    Another similar examples would be Apple Myriad, used under license from Adobe.
    However in some cases lack of the original TM name may not mean it's a knock off
    - for example FF Transit is derived from Frutiger under license.
