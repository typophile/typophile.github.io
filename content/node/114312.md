  body: "I don\u2019t know who did the original logo (which I assume is not based
    on any specific font), but in 2011 the company commissioned a custom typeface
    derived from the logotype: <a href=\"http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/32148/adineue\">AdiNeue</a>."

  body: "The original appears to have been a mash-up of Super Grotesk (developed by
    Arno Drescher in the 1930s for the Typoart foundry) and Helvetica (just the s).
    Though the bold version of Super Grotesk was used, its smaller round counters
    were not--those were enlarged to maintain an even stroke width. The ascender on
    the d was also truncated to the height of the i.\r\n\r\nJoancarles Casas\xEDn--the
    designer of AdiNeue--mentions the \"100% geometrical build\" and the atypical
    s at the link above."
