    intimidating than that.

    file to the PhotoWidget and run a gaussian blur.  <BR>Draw beziers directly in
    the IllyWidget and save as EPS.  <BR>Drag a text file to the InDyWidget, select

    Classic is not in the technical specifications for Tiger. Clasic support came

  body: 'So, broadly speaking, the scoop is this: <BR> <BR>OS X 10.4 &#40;&#34;Tiger&#34;&#41;
    dynamically maps OpenType features to AAT features. So in theory, existing applications
    that support AAT will also see OpenType fonts working much the same way. You should
    be able to get OpenType small caps, ligatures, oldstyle figures, etcetera in Keynote
    and TextEdit. Apple has not yet implemented OpenType support for features needed
    to handle &#34;complex script&#34; languages such as Arabic and Indic, however.
    <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t say we&#39;ve tested Tiger&#39;s OpenType support here at
    Adobe - unfortunately, we&#39;ve just been too swamped with other big projects
    that had similar schedules to Tiger &#40;CS2, Garamond Premier, etc.&#41;. However,
    we are pleased to see Apple offering such support at the system level, broadening
    the base of OpenType support. Having Apple as an increasingly involved partner
    in the OpenType effort can only be good for third party developers and end users.

  body: "I installed Tiger yesterday, but I've noticed a couple things already. File
    server access is much faster in my office to my machine (Dual 1GHz G4 with 1gb
    RAM), than prior running under 10.3.x\r\n\r\nThe Widget thing is neat, but I think
    I'd prefer a different implementation. Also, there is not help documentation telling
    you how to add new widgets that you download. I can open them, and use them, but
    when they are closed they do not go back into the Widget bar. A simple \"do you
    want to install this widget\" dialog box that then moves the open widget to the
    correct library folder would have been great.\r\n\r\nOther than that, Spotlight
    preforms nicely, and Mail 2 looks pretty good. More Apple user interface guidelines
    are broken (ie, Safari gets brushed metal, but Firefox does not, iCal is brushed
    metal, but other Apple programs are not), but that's really just a small aesthetic
    complaint (but that is what design is all about right?).\r\n\r\nSean Glenn\r\nArt
