  body: ' Pretty cool, the swashes too. <BR> <BR>Just one thing: the meat isn&#39;t
    meaty enough. I think it needs more... what are they called, fatty veins? Like
    go to a good deli and ask to see the pancetta. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Hey Hrant, yes I agree. This was so much more apparent in rgb when I first
    created it. It went totally yellow on me in the cmyk conversion, not to mention
    the heavy shadows. I have never had such a hard time in color correcting an image. '

  body: I made a small change at the last minute before it went to print. I cropped
