  Baskerville systems of Emigre and StormType?\r\n\r\n(It has only come onto my radar
  because of a small upcoming identity project for an English antiques gallery for
  whom Baskerville would be an obvious choice. They have a small range of print, web,
  and signage materials to recreate...)\r\n\r\nAnyone want to weigh in on the pros/cons
  of using both complete systems for print, 3D, and web applications?\r\n\r\n***************************************************\r\nSMACKDOWN
