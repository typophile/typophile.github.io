body: The attached document was created prior to 1995 on a 386 Packard Bell computer,
  not on a typewriter as someone has suggested, using LotusWorks.  I need to convert
  this file to Microsoft Word but can not find this font.  Can anyone identify this
  font for me?

    I went to Myfonts.com and entered \"typewriter script\" into its search engine.\r\n"
