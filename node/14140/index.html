I know Tamye, Tiffany, Jared, Joe, Yves, and Zara were part of gang but there were many other smiling helpful faces putting in tons of volunteer hours to make it a big success. 
To all of you, THANK YOU it was a wonderful experience.

		<div class="commentbody">Ed Rondthaler was amazing to watch. I really like his alphabet song and he impressed the heck out of me with his memory – never missed a beat when it came to remembering a name or date. Alessio Leonardi gave a very entertaining talk, and sweating with everyone at Roger Black's lovely sauna was also quite memorable. The duck at Les Halles was brilliant and juicy. There are so many wonderful experiences that I could write a book, but overall I was very inspired by the people I met and everything that I learned from them.

		<div class="commentbody">Low point: realizing at 2am that I've got to wake at 4am for a 6am flight. Still recovering from that one.

High point: Seeing [[Donald Beekman]] on the turntables. That guy can spin!

Funniest point: [[Christoph Winkler]] (technical guru at [[Linotype]]) telling us to stop playing records backwards and to just play some classic rock! Christoph, no hard feelings, but you've got to be more specific. I assumed that since you're German you'd appreciate some techno. Cheers mate.

Epiphany: Speculating with [[Simon Daniels|Si]] about why [[Apple]] doesn't make it to these conferences. If they're really a design oriented company, where are they in the type world? (They're only at [[ATypI]] it seems).

Realization: Contrasting how nice [[Paula Scher]] is in person to... someone else.

Realization: Re-remembering how much I love [[Cyrillic]].

Realization: San Francisco weather really is the best weather in the whole friggin' world.</div>

Getting my type critiqued by Matthew Carter, John Downer, Akira Kobiyashi, and Erik Spiekermann was a dream come true. I met a lot of neat people and in contrast to the fields I was previously involved in (entertainment and the arts) everyone I met seemed very down to earth. </div>

Might change that logo soon though, kinda bored with it.

Yves! You are definitely on my list of highlights. Although I can't really say I am too unsung. Running the risk of being oversung, perhaps. Will send my address once you come back online.

Actually, it has been a while since we've seen Apple at ATypI. Peter Lofting was in Rome in 2002, but that was the last time Apple were represented. Frankly, I'd be happy to see them only attending TypeCon if it were an indication that they were paying any serious attention to type. :(</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Apple's Peter Lofting attended TypeCon2003 in Minneapolis, and I *believe* I chatted with him briefly at TC04 in SF last summer (I seem to recall he was traveling and could only make it for one day or something like that). Apple kindly loaned us Macs for the conference last year, which was a huge help for registration, the store, and attendee "surf stations."

There was another Apple rep or two registered last year, but I'm sure that was due to Apple's proximity to the conference venue. No Apple folk were in attendance in NYC.

I think our little type events are a tiny blip on a radar filled with larger events better targeted to Apple's marketing/recruitment/etc. strategies... but we can always hope for more participation in the future.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This conference was a wonderful experience for me. Various highlights:

1. Discussing my efforts in type design with some experienced type designers. Like Terry, I was overjoyed that you can actually get the best in the world to discuss your work, and found it tremendously stimulating and thought-provoking.  

2. The chance to meet Typophiles in the flesh and blood. Typophile is great, but meeting in person way better. 

3. Presentations: Paula Sher's exciting typography. Mario Feliciano's wonderful revivals of Spanish types. Yves Peters courageous criticism of corporate type pirates--and his amazing dancing.

4. The 'Subway Blues' workshop, which I moderated. It was great that Tamye was willing to put it on the program and find space to talk about NYC transport signage. And it was terrific to have such a stellar panel all agree to be on the round table: Neysa Pranger of Straphangers.org, Eric Spiekermann, James Montalbano, Terry Biddle, and John Berry. All had really interesting and different points to make. I will post more to the thread on it. 

5. I was sad that in arranging the round table and getting critiques I missed: Nick Shinn's workshop on Open type, John Downer on 'Paperback' and the Graffiti presentation. 

Ok, Ok I know, too many superlatives. But this was in fact hands down the best experience for me at a conference, ever!

		<div class="commentbody">I thought the conference was awesome in so many ways. I really enjoyed putting warm human faces to the icons pictured here on typophile and it was great to meet more typophiles and share information. I learned so much! 

I was completely inspired by Paula Scher's presentation and wandered around the city afterwards finding a lot of her work and photographing it; I loved Jakob Trollback's moving type presentation: totally awesome work; I thought Gerard Huerta's working sketches were fantastic and now I can say I KNOW who designed the ACDC logo! The presentation by Alexander Isley was really great, too - so much great design and use of typography in it. My favourite presentation overall was the typographic tattoos - something I never really gave much thought to. 

Meeting Matthew Carter was the icing on the cake for me. And I thought Carlos Mare 139 Rodriguez summed up the conference, in his last slide, which read: 
"Embrace Competitiveness
Challenge your Mentors
Contribute Originality
Expand the Dialogue
Honour your Mentors"

Thanks to everyone for such a great time.</div>

I did manage to introduce myself to Terry, Nick Shinn, William, Tiffany, Dan, Tamye and a few others. I had a bit of a weird experience with someone when I tried to introduce myself to them at the start of the conference and that put me off being too forward and friendly. : (  

I did manage to corner Grant and give him a hard time about the lack of Veer shwag at the conference, though and I drowned my sorrows in the many type tshirts I did buy. (Yes, I know Grant, I know...)

I introduced myself to someone and asked if they were at the conference too (I recognized their photo from the typophile site) and they answered with a "No". I felt a bit embarassed, apologized and left them. 

I then saw them join up with other typophiles. And they ignored me all conference long. I was quite suprised! I mean, I checked for bad breath and all but couldn't quite figure out what happenned.

Anyway, it made me a bit more cautious after that and I met a lot of very very cool people with a lot more class afterwards, who admitted they WERE at the conference.

I am truly sorry about that. It ended up being a mess with the manpower and logistics this year. You weren't the only attendee that filled our collective ear. I promise (really promise) that we'll load up a 'tee-party' full of shwag for Boston. Even if I have to truck the darn stuff there myself.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>I had a bit of a weird experience with someone when I tried to introduce myself to them at the start of the conference and that put me off being too forward and friendly.</em> : (

That would be me. : (

I just received an e-mail from Andi, asking about the Roosevelt incident, and all I can say is I'm so totally and utterly sorry for what happened. I could attribute it to me being nervous at the prospect of meeting Jonathan Hoefler and Stephen not showing up and being in New York for the first time and the lack of sleep of the past days combined with the jetlag, but the bottom line is I <em>completely misunderstood</em> Andi. There really is no excuse for how I behaved, even if it was unwittingly.

I could let this go by quietly as I already sent an e-mail to Andi profusely apologising for this horrible misunderstanding, but I feel public apologies are in order. I hope that people know me well enough to realise this was completely out of character for me. I feel <em>so</em> bad about all this and just wish I could do something, anything to set things right.

Again, please accept my sincerest apologies, Andi.

And anybody, if I zone out and anything like this <em>ever</em> happens again, just friggin' slap me. Like, really hard.</div>

That is a real problem. I met my wife in England and she claims that she couldn't understand me for a year because of my American accent. By that time were were married and it was too late!

Don't slap Yves, kiss him or shake his hand. He had the courage to stand up to corporate pirates at TypeCon. And everybody does something idiotic now and then, but it takes a <a href= "http://www.mentsh.com">mentsh</a> to admit it and move on. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Favorite moments...hmm probably sitting across from Yves at lunch, after lugging 8 boxes of TypeCon shirts back from UPS, and discussing type stuff (duh) then realizing that I had been visiting his website for months now (www.typographer.org) and now I was face to face with the man himself! I thouroughly enjoyed spending time and talking with you Yves, and I've enjoyed my 'Limited Edition' review booklet. I'll be sure to go to TypeCon2006 in Boston. I also look forward to meeting some of the other people and getting to experience the next conference not as a volunteer. :D</div>
