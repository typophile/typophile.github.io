  the diversity of the communities served by their nonprofit organization'. sigh.\r\n\r\ni
  feel that i have actually seen 1 or 2 examples of identity systems that used multiple
  fonts well - can anyone think of successful examples of this? or have other advice...?\r\n\r\nthanks!!"

    what you (or the client) have in mind. For example something like a word where
    every letter is from a different font can be made to work I think, it's just very
    hard to pull off without looking ransom-note-ish (or just plain bad). \r\nIt might
    be an interesting alternative to look at font systems that combine multiple stylistic
    variants, like <a href=\"http://fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_polymorph_ot/\">FF
    Polymorph</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/portfolio/twin/index.html\">the
    conceptual work that Letterror did for the Twin Cities</a> (the latter, I think,
    is not available as a font? But can maybe give you some ideas)."

    seen ads where different languages are used to show diversity, but to try to do
    the same thing in a logo would be a mistake, I fear. For one thing, really good
    logos don't use any type, and those that do only use a few letters. \r\n\r\nIf
    you have so many words in a logo that you can start using that many different
    faces, then you really aren't building a logo, but an advertisement. And if they
    are thinking of using different faces in a single word ... (shudder)."

    quality of a logo through minimizing the elements used while maximizing recognizability.
    As in the Nike swoosh. But (apart from the fact that, like Hrant says, it's not
    always workable to go without type) I wouldn't think that's the only measure of
    success in a logo; there are some terrific logos that use (and depend on) type.
    Are wordmarks inherently worse? Like Coca-Cola \u2013 is that really worse than
    Nike? "
