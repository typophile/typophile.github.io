  I cannot find anyone suitably narrow and the shape of the serifs.\r\n\r\nBest bets:
  ITC Milano\r\nSequoia (not terribly loving it)\r\n\r\nOthers I looked at: Caslon
  Graphique, Carousel, Annlie, Fat Face, Pistilli, FC Didoni.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly
  appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_5719_4853.jpg]"

  body: "This is the design used in the Random House, New York, first edition of 1974.\r\nAt
    that time New York publishers often used photo-typositing  fonts from Photo Lettering
    or one of it's competitors. These were often photo manipulated versions of various
    fonts.\r\nPerhaps not digitized. Some checking of the photo lettering catalogs
    may produce a match. The kind of font that was produced by designers such as Herb
    Lubalin and Tom Carnese.\r\nDon"

  body: Can't name it either. As you both said, close to [[http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/m/milano-roman.html|Milano
    Roman]] and the work of Tom Carnase. It mixes influences from [[http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/t/toms-roman.html|Tom's
    Roman]] (Carnase's again), [[http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/t/trooper-roman.html|Trooper
    Roman]] and <strong>[[http://www.photolettering.com/|PLINC Caslon Benguiat]]</strong>,
    Benguiat's version of Caslon, digitized by Christian Schwartz and available through
    House Industries Photo-Lettering catalog (possibly the closest shamelessly squooshing
    it).

  body: "Thanks Ryuk, for confirming my suspicion that this was a Photo-lettering
    font delivered to Random House, New York.\r\nPhoto-lettering provided its fonts
    in a range of widths, including the one used for _Myron_. Apparently only the
    regular width has been digitized. \r\nFor an exact match to the book cover here
    is the correct width of Caslon Benguiat:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaslonBenguiatCond_4946.jpg]\r\nBonus:A
