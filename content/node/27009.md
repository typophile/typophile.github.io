body: It was hard work, but I&#39;ve finally managed to track down  <BR>the elusive
  sans serif which had everyone puzzled since  <BR>Jonathan lawley posted <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27701.html"
  target="_blank"> this identification request</a> more  <BR>than two months ago.
  It is a face in development by  <BR>Florian Ribisch, a Viennese designer, currently
  working  <BR>as an art director for the Italian magazine GLAMOUR. <BR> <BR>==========
  <BR>Hi, my name is Florian Ribisch. <BR> <BR>The typeface of the album <a href="http://www.mic.gr/cds.asp?id=25016"
  target="_blank"> &#34;The Eclectic Sound Of Vienna - </a> <BR><a href="http://www.mic.gr/cds.asp?id=25016"
  target="_blank"> Vol. 5&#34;</a> is called LABOR and was done by me. <a href="http://www.oliverkartak.com/"
  target="_blank"> Oliver Kartak</a>,  <BR>the designer of the sleeve, did use it
  exclusively, since the  <BR>font is not 100% ready yet. <BR> <BR>Hopefully it will
  be soon - I&#39;m working on it. <BR> <BR>Sincerely, Florian Ribisch
