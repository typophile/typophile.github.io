  body: I see nothing to indicate it is a font. I don't understand why it has become
    so common to assume everything in print or online that has lettering must be a
    font.

  body: Two words... sterile sans!!!!!! It has taken over to the detriment of words
    with passion. I look at magazines and they are boring, ultra "sanitary," no personality...
    and students are being fed Helvetica and all its variants, ad nauseam. Then when
    they encounter something with an "out of the box" appearance (no matter how bad)
    they think that it is a font because the do not have the skills to differentiate,
    or how to engage an artist to do what they need. Or worse yet... they are to cheap
    to pay for original art to enhance the product!

  body: "Yeah yeah\u2026 point taken.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware that this could be a
    custom design. However, I'm also aware that there is a trend happening with hand-generated
    fonts, aka 'Hand-Set' fonts, that do not necessarily end up as full body typefaces
    (in the traditional sense \u2013 with formatting and alternates).\r\n\r\nYou can
    see some examples here:\r\n1) http://www.youworkforthem.com/list.php?cat=113\r\n2)
    http://www.t26.com/illustrations/Wood_Type_Bundle\r\n3) http://www.t26.com/illustrations/SketchType\r\n\r\nAnd
    given that the image was taken from a week-to-week HTML email (which you'd think
    would be a bit overkill to produce some custom lettering for), I was hoping someone
    might have come across this.\r\n\r\nI have posted with consideration folks.\r\n"

    have been (or should have been) red-faced to find that \"hand-drawn\" really was
    a font. Even if it was not, rebuking a poster is not a preferred response.\r\n\r\nEven
    if something was hand-drawn, often there are more than a few fonts that come close
    to replicating the same feel.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@ Steve\r\n\r\nIn this instance it is not a font... I knew it and had no
    problem stating such. I have no problems suggesting an alternative. I just get
    tired of people going \"what is that font\" without the slightest bit of knowledge,
    assuming something like this is a font. I do not accept the premise that if it
    is in print it must be a font, which is what a lot people assume.\r\n\r\nAs one
    who earns his living with calligraphy, lettering, hand drawn  etc. forms I figure
    I don't f*** up that much when calling something like this. If I am not sure,
    I keep my mouth shut. So do not include me in your witch hunt of erroneous font/non
    font identifiers with red faces!"

    for the other posters, I deem you took a fair amount of time considering your

  body: "@Floatingworld;\r\nMy point was first that because of the amateurish nature
    of the lettering and the fact there were no duplicates it is most likely hand
    lettering. I do realize there are a number of simple free fonts like this available,
    but these usually don't include enough alternates to do this setting. \r\nSecondly\u2026
    I'm not trying to come off sounding so pointed towards you particularly. I'm sure
    you have valid reasons for posting. I've just seen so many postings that do assume
    everything must be a font. I even had a potential client a short while ago asking
    about a using my font for her logo like the one in my \"hand lettered\" design.
    I actually had to explain a few times that it was in fact not a font. The fact
    that you also asked for an alternative at least showed you were open to the possibility
    it wasn't type. I did actually search to find something close, but didn't see
    anything all that close to the sample. Granted my tone was a bit sour. I don't
    typically have harsh comments and so I apologize for that.\r\n\r\nYou might consider
    asking the folks who send out the weekly HTMLemail about the lettering. I imagine
    they would let you know if it was a font or handlettering. It's possible they
    have a custom font."
