    <BR>Note that -possibly contrary to Carter&#39;s preferences- the MS guys decided
    to replace the hybrid figures with &#34;proper old-style figures&#34;, in 1998.
    Although I like the hybrid approach, I suspect that MS might have done some -possibly
    informal- focus group sessions where enough people complained that the figures
    &#34;seem somewhat misaligned or something&#34; that they decided to play it safe
    and make them &#42;really&#42; &#34;misaligned&#34; &#40;traditional old-style&#41;,
    so as to &#34;snap away&#34; from the bothersome &#34;somewhat misaligned&#34;
    stigma and go into the open waters of &#34;just not aligned&#34;... :-&#41;  This
    might be especially true in the low-res screen world, Georgia&#39;s primary target.
    As for Solex, considering it&#39;s essentially a display face, I&#39;d prefer
    lining figures, at least as the primary form &#40;although alternates -especially
    coupled to OpenType technology- are always welcome&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: ' So I went to check out those hybrid numerals in Sports Illustrated, and
    they were even nicer than I expected. For those wondering: they&#39;re basically
    3/4 height numerals of wide set, but with a very modest oldstyle up&amp;down:
    the effect is one of friendly sophistication - and it&#39;s more readable &#40;and
    to a lesser extent more legibile too&#41; than any lining scheme. So I think I&#39;m
    going hybrid next time! <BR> <BR>BTW, another interesting thing was the smallcaps.
    I&#39;m calling them midcaps: they&#39;re taller and not so wide, and seem to
    have been designed to set acronyms in running text, as opposed to mixing with
    &#34;normal&#34; caps. And to be honest, very few people use smallcaps - acronyms
    are so much more common, so maybe we should be making midcaps instead &#40;or
    at least first/primarily&#41;? <BR> <BR>In toto, in the context of American sports,
    both the numerals and the midcaps seem to be very intelligent solutions. <BR>
    <BR>I also found the font as a whole to be very nice, even though I really don&#39;t
    like Moderns; it sort of reminded me of Olympian, the way Carter took a dated
    model and deftly made it much better &#40;like the lc &#34;k&#34;, in both Fenway
    and Olympian&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW, speaking of numerals, Jonathan, if I may ask:
    <BR>What do you think of using other distributions of the up&amp;down? For example,
    what about making the &#34;3&#34; and &#34;5&#34; ascend instead of descend? Some
    old French foundries &#40;like D&amp;P&#41; used to do this, and I like it better
    myself - but virtually everybody does the oldstyle figures the same way. Is there
    a reason besides conformity? <BR> <BR>hhp '
