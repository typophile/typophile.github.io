  body: "A lot depends on how you want the Hebrew text to appear relative to the basic
    text, and that probably depends on the context. If you're talking about the Hebrew
    words, it might appear differently than if you were just including a Hebrew expression
    much as you might a common French expression.\r\n\r\nThe Davka family of Hebrew
    fonts probably has a sufficient inventory all in one place to give you as many
    options as you might need.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.davka.com/cgi-bin/product.cgi?product=568]]\r\n\r\nScroll
    down until you can follow the links to the sample images (they're small, but should
    be adequate).\r\n\r\n - Herb "
