  notation. Know of any? <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;ve been trying to decide if text figures
  are a good choice for mathematical/technical texts. For example: <BR> <BR>y = 3x
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m so used to seeing titling figures used in this situation that when
  I try using text figures, it looks very strange. I think having a height difference
  between numbers and variables is a good way to visually distinguish them. Also,
  the convention is to seperate mathematical formulas from the rest of the text, sort
  of the way you would a block quote. If you accept that convention, none of the arguments
  about titling figures disrupting the even texture of a block of text apply.  <BR>
  <BR>This leads me to consider mixing text figures and titling figures; test figures
  for numbers in blocks of text, and titling figures for formulas, but this looks
  inconsistent. How do others deal with this issue? <BR> <BR>Any good texts that cover
  mathematical typography? <BR> <BR>Matt <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>Thierry Bouche had some examples of using text figures in maths here:

    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s an attemp to reproduce the look of an older mathematical book
    which was set in Baskerville with text figures. Donald E. Knuth&#39;s <i>Concrete
    Mathematics</i> was also set with a mixture of text figures and lining figures
    for different purpose. The other bit was that DEK used different fonts: his CM
    Concrete for text and Zapf&#39;s Euler for maths. Yannis Haralambous wrote an
    artilce &#40;in French&#41; on how he used Baskerville for maths -- the like is
    currently down for me, cannot confirm. <BR> <BR>I have started trying to set my
    current writing with text figures. The pages look quite nice with Minion, New
    Baskerville, and Euler in different run of course. Cronos&#43;Euler looks quite
    handsome on a projector.'

    The French have always liked Baskerville, and for a while they were doyens of

    still debating the virtues of text and titling figures in this context. I supposed
    there are no real rules to follow, only what works for the job. <BR> <BR>Matt
