  a small section from a 1407 Belgian Latin Bible (I found this <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg\">on
  Wikimedia</a>) shows two quite distinct glyphs for \u27E8a\u27E9, seemingly based
  on position in the word, akin to how \u27E8s\u27E9 is word-final and \u27E8\u017F\u27E9
  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it seems that there is one form (which I've highlighted
  in red), very similar to an ordinary double-story \u27E8a\u27E9, that seems to appear
  mostly at word-initially. The other form (highlighted in blue) looks like a script
  \u27E8\u0251\u27E9 with a bar in the middle, and appears elsewhere. \r\n\r\nI say
  \"mostly\" because in this small sample there are two instances (which I've double-highlighted)
  where the initial form comes non-initially: the partially-visible \u27E8a\u27E9
  on the first line, and the last one on the fifth line. The latter comes after one
  of those contracting dots, so I wonder if that's relevant.\r\n\r\nHas anybody noticed
  examples of these variants used in relatively consistent contexts, like this? And
  can anybody explain the exceptions to the apparent rule? I'd love to see more examples
  (and I'd especially love to see more of this particular manuscript)."

  body: "I would say it\u2019s a way to stress the picket fence effect of this type
    of writing. It\u2019s a purely visual change, not an orthographical one. The writer
    does the same thing with the r. \r\nYou have a regular r at the end of words,
    but a narrow so-called \u201Cround r\u201D within words. \r\nThe a exception is
    explainable through the preceding letter. The e doesn\u2019t end with a stroke
    on the right side and even creates a gap there. So the writer fills in this space
    with the regular a this time, whereas in all other cases he can continue the picket
    fence look of the preceding letters with the unusual a shape or he can even connect
    the letters as in the d+a case. "

  body: I think TypoGuru is spot on. Medieval scribes frequently used many kinds of
    ligatures and diphthongs, some 'standard' but others sometimes quite 'individual'.
    In this instance the scribe is using the vertical of the preceding letter and
    combining it with the a.

    with a bar across. To me, they look like small cap \u27E8\u1D00\u27E9."
