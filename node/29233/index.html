  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>[[Indices]] : [[Type and Lettering Styles]] : Venetian</strong></p>
<p>Early [[Old Style]] of the Renaissance period, also called [[Humanist]]. Letterforms are based on calligraphic principles, including modulated [[stroke]], humanist axis, [[lachrymal terminal|lachrymal]] terminals, large [[aperture]]. The single most distinctive letter to distinguish Venetians from their cousins is the slanted crossbar in the miniscule &lsquo;e&rsquo;. The Venetian [[italic|italics]] were designed separately from [[roman]] fonts and were used independently.</p>
<p>The archetypal Venetian font is that of [[Nicholas Jenson]], as used in the 1470 <em>Evangelica Praeparatione</em> by [[Eusebius]]. In fact, it is Jenson&rsquo;s city, Venice, that gives this family its name. The Eusebius was an absolute masterwork of printing, and is widely considered to be the first appearance of our entirely modern Roman letterforms.</p>
<p>Many Venetian fonts are adaptations of the Eusebius, with varying levels of literalness. &ldquo;Nicolas Jenson SG&rdquo;, (metal) Monotype Eusebius, Abrams Venetian, and Adobe Jenson are all fairly faithful adaptations. [[Centaur]] is a reinterpretation based on the calligraphic structure that [[Bruce Rogers]] saw from his study of photographic enlargements of the Eusebius. ATF [[Cloister]] falls somewhere between the literal and calligraphic categories, as does the similar [[Doves Press]] font. [[Goodchild]], by [[Nick Shinn]], and its headline companion [[Nicholas]], is a modern update of the calligraphic approach, with a large [[x-height]] and tight [[letterspacing]].</p>
<p>The Zeno type of [[Giovanni Mardersteig]] can also be classified as a Venetian, and bears many similarities, while also displaying the master craftsmanship and distinctive style of Mardersteig&rsquo;s hand, working in collaboration with punchcutter [[Charles Malin]].</p>
<p>One branch of the Venetian family tree caricatures the relatively heavy serifs compared with the later movement to hairlines, culminating in the [[Didone|Didones]]. The [[Kelmscott Press]] and [[Golden types]] of [[William Morris]] are the best known examples, both exhibiting heavy slablike [[serifs]] bearing little resemblence to the Eusebius original, which was impressively refined not only for its day but for several centuries afterwards. ITC released its revival of the Golden type in 1989. ITC Italia also shows clear influence from the Golden tradition, but also mixes in elements of [[Souvenir]] and the slab serifs.</p>
<p>In an even more radical interpretation, Monotype&rsquo;s [[Legacy Sans]] claims to be a sans serif based on the skeletal structure of the Eusebius.</p>
<p>Venetian was a brilliant and highly readable advance in the design of letterforms. The [[Garalde]] style was clearly an incremental evolution of the standard set by Jenson, and its differences are primarily in small details such as the crossbar of the &lsquo;e&rsquo;. Designers continue to draw inspiration from this landmark font, and new designs in the Venetian tradition are still going strong.</p>
