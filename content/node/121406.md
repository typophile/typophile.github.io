    destination scrolls for placards which were also hand-drawn/painted. Some previous
    discussions on the topic: http://typophile.com/node/112952, http://typophile.com/node/80009,
    http://typophile.com/node/118786, http://typophile.com/node/98458\r\nBy following
    these links you will find more alternatives. Hint: try to consider these letterings
    as a mash-up of the suggested digital alternatives."
