  dog tag military embossing machines for days now. The font itself must be lighter
  than the embossed result.  Answering Identifont's questionnaire i says that Briem
  Mono, Century Schoolbook Monospace or Computer Modern Teletype (CMTT10) are a good
  match, but I do not agree. Particularly letters O, G, Q and C are different, for
  example, the O on a dog tag looks like an athletics race track.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know what font this is?"

    the letters appear to have serifs, but they could perhaps actually be a sans serif
    with the light hitting some sides of the raised lettering more than others, which
    could give the impression of serifs.\r\nIf you have the original and not just
    a photo, close examination with a magnifying glass should resolve this point.\r\ndon"

  body: "I knew I had seen these tags before. This was the answer I gave then:\r\n\r\n---start
    quote---\r\nStamped tags? If so probably not made from a conventional font.\r\nGood
    matches for appearance are two fonts based on engraving systems. Lineto's Gravur
    Condensed http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/
    and Optimo's Gravostyle Basic http://optimo.ch/typefaces_Gravostyle-Basic_all_CharacterMap.html
    Only major difference that I spotted is the open top 4 and the tails on 6 & 9.
    There are other engraving/machine plotting fonts, but they are generally wider
    than the letters on the tags, particularly for O, C etc. which usually are rounded
    without the parallel stroke section on the sides.\r\n---end quote---\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/115178\r\nDon"

    using only \"military dogtag font\" in Google turns up quite a few interesting
    hits."

  body: "Comparing the present image with the one in node 3286 I conclude that both
    are monospaced fonts, which makes sense for stamping keys.\r\nBut I see significant
    differences, even with this ambiguous image, in letterforms.\r\nLook for example
    at the center strokes in _E_ and _F_. Much further in this tag than the one in
    node 3286. Huge serifs on _I_ in node 3286, but none detectable in this image.
    \ A letter by letter comparison reveals other differences.\r\nBased on this image
    I still don't see serifs, or at the most I could perhaps see the hint of tiny
    ones.\r\nFor a substitute you could use either a Sans serif, as suggested in previous
    posts,  or a monospace version of a tiny square serif like Cushing Two http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/cushing-two/
    or Bushing http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/bushing/  or Knubi http://www.verg.com.au/portfolio/knubi/\r\nUnfortunately,
    the more I look at this I am, persuaded that there is no close digital font.\r\nDon\r\n\r\nDon"
