  body: "This is not a font as it, more custom job. You could easily redo the same
    by picking any gothic condensed of your choice and some slab serifs (strokes)
    to terminals.\r\nIf you still need a close base font (possibly even matching),
    you can use [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/steelfish|Steelfish]] or
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic|Trump Gothic]]."
