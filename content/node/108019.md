  body: This one has elements typical of the sign painter's art, and I believe it
    was done by hand due to some differences in duplicate letters. If so it was done
    by a master of the art, clearly not an amateur.

  body: Ah, not what I was hoping for but I appreciate your feedback! Another person
    thought the font might be based on ITC Benguiat although there are differences.
