  use these really nice Typefaces with borders and images.\r\nIm not sure the term
  used, can anyone tell me where I can find examples of this work or where it is sourced
  from?\r\nPerhaps 60's european Typography or something?\r\nI hope this makes sense?\r\n\r\nThankyou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.albinholmqvist.com/#970673/EF-Live-The-Language"

  body: The name of this particular typeface is, befittingly, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/parisian/|Parisian]],
    it's an Art Deco - 1920s -  typeface. But they seem to be using all sorts of styles
    in the different videos, no concrete theme except I guess elegance! Any particular
    ones you're after?

    be good to find some reference point for such inspiration.\r\nThanks for your
    help.\r\n"
