  sharp in the node propersites window when I'm sure it should be smooth.\r\nAre there
  any reasons why this could be happening?\r\nIs there a way fixing the nodes propersites
  to the correct connection or is it a question of going through each glyph and changing
  it in the node propersites window."

    activate in the preferences: Glyph Window > Appearence.\r\n\r\nThen it would look
    like this, and it is easier to see what kind of node you are dealing with and
    if you double-click on a sharp node that could be smooth, it will automatically
    \"correct\" this node.\r\n\r\nRED = sharp\r\nPINK = Smooth\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/colorednodes_4373.png]"

  body: 'Double click changes a node from corner to smooth and visa-versa. There is
    a problem with FontLab changing connections represented as smooth to corners--with
    the x instead of the o--when you re-open a glyph window (I think), or copy and
    paste a glyph (definite). As I understand it, this actually doesn''t change anything
    with the font when you export it, as the different node types are indications
    for convenience of designers, and not part of the font''s code. Still is it annoying,
    and hopefully they will fix it. '

  body: "Is there a place where it says what the node colors mean?\r\nFor example,
    I don't have pink. I have red, green, yellow and blue nodes.\r\n\r\nI guess blue
    is starting node and red is sharp. It looks like green is smooth for me. Don't
    know what yellow is though. And the difference between pink and green?\r\n\r\n[edit]
    Oh, I just saw one pink one."

  body: Thanks. I sort off figured it out. However, some of my glyphs have yellow
    nodes. BCP's are yellow, but some nodes are too.

  body: "A node appearing yellow probably means that one or both of its BCPs is retracted
    and overlapping. Alt/Option-click to drag the BCP off the node.\r\n\r\nThe \"Correct
    Connections\" command in the Contour menu should fix incorrect sharp connections
    and turn any erroneous x'es back to o's."

  body: "The node stayed yellow because its other BCP is still retracted. Alt/Option-click
    the node again and drag its second BCP down to the left. (Occasionally, Alt-dragging
    moves the node instead, leaving the BCP in place, I'm not sure why.)\r\n\r\n<em>I
    have some nodes which have no BCP or only one. Which ideally should have another
    one</em>\r\n\r\n\"Yellow\" nodes with retracted BCPs may look like they have one
    or zero BCPs, but the BCPs are there, in plain view, covering the node. Just Alt-drag
    them off.\r\n\r\nAlt/Option-dragging also works on sharp and tangent nodes. Alt-drag
    from the node to pull out a BCP, or Alt-drag from a straight line-segment to create
    BCPs from both adjacent nodes (convert to curve).\r\n"

    I deleted the BCP.\r\n\r\nWell, I can manage, I just never switched on the colours
    before, so I was curious what they meant. :)"
