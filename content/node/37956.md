  body: Oh, I wouldn't dare uninstall Helvetica or Arial, as much as I would like
    to! The only font I've installed recently is Jugend, an old-time spidery-looking
    display font. I ended up not even using it.

    Windoze XP box & as far as I know, the only thing XP has that I don't is the dancing

    need. I haven't worked on a Mac."
