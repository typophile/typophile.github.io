  body: "I am pretty sure I searched for this when it was first posted. It was not
    in the ClickArt Handwritten fonts collection, which often has a lot of these amateur-looking
    printed fonts. One distinctive aspect of this font is that it was made to include
    Swedish accents, which most such fonts rarely have. It also has what I consider
    to be a distinctly European J. So I suspect either a European freebie font (I
    believe I checked Dafont already in February), or a custom font made for the magazine.
    As I have said hundreds of times, this style of font can be made by anyone, and
    very cheaply, so custom is not a big deal.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I just went through nearly 1500 samples at Abstract Fonts and Dafont, just
    to see if this was a freebie at either site. No luck.\r\n\r\nIt's possible it
    is a commercial font, but it seems less likely to me than a free one, because
    frankly, there's not much reason for people to pay for something when so many
    free fonts would be so close they would be hard to tell apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike
