  body: "I like a pointy tip, as in Geometric 415, some weights of Futura, Neutraface,
    Nobel, the aforementioned Eagle.\r\n\r\nGill Sans has a nice A. As does Today
    Sans.\r\n\r\nGotham is nice at the lighter weights, but from Bold on down the
    counters start to fill in.\r\n\r\nI think this is kind of a strange topic. Most
    of those A's are kind of uninspiring. Were you bored or something? Or doing a
    logo where you need a big A?\r\n\r\nI tend to focus more on the R with Sans, am
    partial to the Franklin Gothic/Gotham/Avenir style."

  body: I've changed my mind, I'll cut it out from thin, wooden board and I found
    that Geometric 415 is very appropriate (I mean easy and good lookin) for the task
    (god what a task), and apologies from those who were bored by this topic, I'm
    still a newbie.. :) ..and thanx for suggestions..
