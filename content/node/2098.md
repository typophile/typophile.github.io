body: Hearing a word &#34;rip&#34; several times a week was pretty normal for me once.
  Those were the times when I was browsing other forums on a regular basis, loosing
  my time reading crap and browsing the net really a lot.  One of the outcomes is
  - I fear the word &#34;rip&#34;. I fear it most definitely in a good way - I didn&#39;t
  stop working on my projects, but I also started to be ultra-critique to my work,
  especially in terms of ripping someone other&#39;s masterpieces. <BR>And it&#39;s
  turning really weird sometimes. There is a project, there are all variables in my
  disposition, I have a chance to express my style, my way of thinking &#40;do I have
  one, I wonder?&#41;, while satisfying client&#39;s goals and expectations. Sounds
  nice, huh? Not really. Lately I feel like being in a vacuum of thoughts - I lost
  if not the whole, then a big part of vision I had, I find myself doing the same
  stuff over and over again &#40;like doing sketches of a logo and then seeing, that
  I finally have a GM Saturn&#39;s logo looking at me instead of something original;
  or I end up having something really close to what I&#39;ve done before and it hurts
  my eyes even more than Saturn&#39;s copy&#41;. And that&#39;s bothering me a lot.
  Really a lot. <BR>I see other people&#39;s works, and I see ideas behind the pictures,
  I see what a stranger wouldn&#39;t see, but would notice and remember - and that&#39;s
  what I lack. I lack ideas. <BR>So I decided to go the most unoriginal and common
  way - tipped amazon.com and bought some nice books. Like &#34;Design Writing Research&#34;
  or &#34;Stop Stealing Ship...&#34;, etc. I read them carefully. At least, I think
  I did. But I didn&#39;t find what I was looking for - an idea on ideas, a hint on
  direction. Nothing. I learnt something new, for sure, but not what I was eager to.
  <BR> <BR>Tell me what you do. How do you not copy others and yourself, stay fresh,
  get ideas - where is your inspiration? A design is not a pure inspiration, but I
  got a lot on the other side of the coin and I need to get the darker side shining
  as well. <BR> <BR>Start here.

  body: Books won&#39;t work - no other person can formally teach you to be[come]
    creative. <BR> <BR>Try doing things you&#39;ve never done before - that&#39;s
    the only way I know of triggering inspiration, as long as you&#39;re not consciously
    obsessing about it. And best of all is travelling to strange places. You&#39;re
    in Frankfurt. Try a vacation in Tunis. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hrant, that sure worked for Paul Klee didn&#39;t it. His colors changed dramaticly.
    We are lucky in Manhattan to have a large collection of his work at the Met Museum.

    know it worked for my dad: he tells how during the writing of his PhD thesis at
    Ohio State he became completely stuck. He went on a month-long vacation with wife
    and daughter to Florida. He got back, and that night during his sleep he found
    the missing piece of the puzzle. <BR> <BR>And I&#39;ve yet to &#34;process&#34;
    all that I saw during my trip to Bangkok more than three years ago. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Go to a science museum and don&#39;t pay attention to how the graphics look,
    pay attention to what they say. Look past the subject of the photos at the details
    of the pictures. <BR> <BR>See if you can get a tour of a factory and go and watch
    the people and machines.  <BR> <BR>Change locations/vacations - what Hrant said
    - if you can, and you don&#39;t have a bad deadline. Or, if you can take the risk,
    do it in spite of the deadline. Try to go places you never go.  <BR> <BR>If you
    use a computer to design, use a paintbrush, some latex paint and some newspaper
    to design. Try everything that you don&#39;t do. Pay attention to what you think
    and feel when you do it. Change the music you listen to. Doesn&#39;t have to be
    forever, just for a time. <BR> <BR>If you do look at books look at books about
    things other than design or type. Look at sports books, history books, comic books,
    science books. <BR> <BR>You can&#39;t be creative from a book, and you can&#39;t
    be creative if you can&#39;t see other things, ways, an approaches to life&#39;s
    problems and life&#39;s purposes. I love <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program.html">science
    stuff</a>. So much of it is just so <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/pulspowr/facilities/zaccelerator.html">amazing</a>
    &#40;check out the second picture on the right right click to download it, it&#39;s
    big but so insanely cool&#41;. <BR> <BR>Hang in there man. Lots of us feel less
    creative as Winter rolls around here in the northern hemisphere.

  body: Rather than worry about your &#34;creativity&#34; or lack thereof, focus on
    the craft of what you do. Your technique. Repetition of, and attention to the
    details of your work can cause you to discover things you did not know were there.

  body: Try creating bad design -- really bad. That can be a sort of &#34;palate cleanser&#34;
    for all the mediocrity that builds up in one&#39;s head. The next day, turn it
    into something crazily good. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re going to read for inspiration,
    don&#39;t read about graphic design, Read about ideas, inventions, how things
    work, events that changed the world, stunning beauty, appalling atrocity, inexplicable
    strangeness. Find authors of fiction or poetry whose work you think you don&#39;t
    understand. <BR> <BR>All of these are ways of turning down the volume on your
    analytical mind, and turning up the volume on your receptive, creative mind.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, know that every designer has periods like this. It&#39;s your job to
    find a way out of it -- but don&#39;t panic. It&#39;s normal.

  body: 'Another thought... <BR> <BR>This may be just me, but when I&#39;m feeling
    locked into mediocrity I like to go to the zoo. For one thing, watching how different
    animals move is inspirational: otter, elephant, owl, boa constrictor, orangutan.
    For another, the inherent tension between preservation and captivity makes sparks
    for me. I&#39;m sure this is not universal, but there must be other places or
    activities that make sparks for you. Find them.'
