    type "WBW" in the search box: you will find 21 woodtype fonts, many of which were
    named for towns in Texas.'

  body: You could also do a search at MyFonts for "Texas", and see that Phil Martin
    was born in Texas, and Scriptorium is based there. Another Houston-based designer
    is the Swisswoman Sibylle Hagmann, whose "Cholla" typeface for Emigre is named
    after a kind of cactus.

  body: Ummm...thanks for the info on the Texas connections, Chester, but you neglected
    to mention that I lived in the Lone Star State for 45 years, designed dustjackets
    for several books on Texas history, had a brief flirtation with a former Miss
    Texas USA (who is now old enough to be a grandmother to a lot of you young whippersnappers),

    woud surely have pimped you too. (I certainly don't mean to suggest that MyFonts
    has the answers to all typographic questions.) As for Texas beer... I'm sad for
    your loss of the Celis Brewery. Although from what I can gather, M. Celis is still
    supervising the brewing of his fabulous beers in Michigan, and has not abandoned
    his bolo tie.\r\n\r\nPS; Nick, having looked briefly at your site, I wonder if
    you could suggest some Texas-specific types you have digitised."

    the majority of my woodtype fonts, which have the suffix WBW (for Whiz-Bang Woodtype)
    are named for Texas towns (Dime Box, Falfurrias, Grand Prairie, Jefferson (Pilot),
    Mexia, New Boston, Pilot Point, Refugio, San Marcos, Sulphur Springs, Terlingua
    and Waxahachie); Texas rivers (Brazos and Rio Grande); Texas bays (Laguna Madre);
    or Texas phenomena (Gullywasher and Spindletop)."
