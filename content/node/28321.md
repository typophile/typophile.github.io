    play a sanctimonious part,\r\nWith a pirate head and a pirate heart.\r\nAway to
    the cheating world go you,\r\nWhere pirates all are well-to-do;\r\nBut I\u2019ll
    be true to the song I sing,\r\nAnd live and die a Pirate King.\r\n\r\nFor I am
    a Pirate King!\r\nAnd it is, it is a glorious thing\r\nTo be a Pirate King!\r\n\r\nFor
    I am a Pirate King!\r\n\r\nYou are!\r\nHurrah for our Pirate King!\r\n\r\nAnd
    it is, it is a glorious thing\r\nTo be a Pirate King.\r\n\r\nIt is!\r\nHurrah
    for our Pirate King!\r\n\r\nHurrah for the/our Pirate King!\r\n\r\nWhen I sally
    forth to seek my prey\r\nI help myself in a royal way.\r\nI sink a few more ships,
    it\u2019s true,\r\nThan a well-bred monarch ought to do;\r\nBut many a king on
    a first-class throne,\r\nIf he wants to call his crown his own,\r\nMust manage
    somehow to get through\r\nMore dirty work than ever I do,\r\n\r\nFor I am a Pirate
    King!\r\nAnd it is, it is a glorious thing\r\nTo be a Pirate King!\r\n\r\nFor
    I am a Pirate King!\r\nYou are!\r\nHurrah for the Pirate King!\r\nAnd it is, it
    is a glorious thing\r\nTo be a Pirate King.\r\nIt is!\r\nHurrah for our Pirate
    King!\r\nHurrah for Si our Pirate King!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: We all know about type pirates, but is there such a thing as pirate type?
    Slightly quirky blackletter typefaces seem popular, as do broadpen scripts with
    lots of swashes and flourishes. If you ever see a pirate flag with the words "Jolly
    Roger" set in Helvetica (and the skull and crossbones from Wingdings), you know
    you're in trouble.
