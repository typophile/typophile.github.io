  serif from [[http://vimeo.com/29756738|this little video directed by Rimantas Lukavicius]]:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/InfinityWater_4198.png]\r\n\r\nI
  really like the simplicity of it, particularly the \"R\".\r\n\r\nMany thanks in
  advance,\r\n\r\nDylan"

  body: "E and F look like from \u203AInterstate\u2039, as well as R, but W is too
    wide. Maybe it was customized."

  body: "Yeah, I'd thought Interstate also, and it could well be a slightly modified
    version, but I think the \"C\", \"D\"  and \"S\" are a little more boxy than Interstate
    (although it is hard to be sure when it is so tiny).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaseStudy_4360.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    fork of the \"Y\" looks a little smaller than Interstate also.\r\n\r\nDylan"
