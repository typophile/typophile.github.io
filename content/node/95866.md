  the font pairing and global appearance of this combination. At the moment, it is
  just a start on a business card. The company is specialized in high-end microelectronics
  and wants to contrast radically from the other companies in their sector... I made
  some boards with different variations and identity elements, but I need to know
  what you are thinkning about those two simple lines : logo and font pairing... Thank
  you by advance to all of you !\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/weeroc_noise_72_dpi_3434.png]"

    "pseudo-monowidth" font, you mean something like a Letter Gothic for instance
    ?

    \"errors\" have had an upturn lately (although <em>faux na\xEFve</em> is probably
    dead by Christmas). As already mentioned, the weight is problematic, but I also
    think the balance (both overall, and inter-letter) and lack of optical adjustments
    is.\r\n\r\nWhat is it supposed to be, btw?"

  body: "You are right, there are visual mistakes. The \"roc\" is the suffix for a
    whole line of products, and \"wee\" suggests three specific know-how of the company.
    The whole name means also what it tells phonetically... The circle simply recalls
    the \"bridge\" between two meanings : \"we rock\" and the technical meaning very
    near from the wafers used in electronics. I am looking for a way to make \"we\"
    clearly appear and at the same time, suggest that \"roc\" is like a mark inside
    of the company. The (k) suggests the mathematics (power, equations, ... ) and
    also forms the \"k\" of \"rock\". \r\nOne of the difficulties I have is that the
    logo has to be ready to be printed in really exotic conditions ( nanometric print
    on circuits, print on materials used in satellites,.... ). I thought quite \"na\xEFvely\"
    that visual mistakes would permit to perceive more easily the logo in very special
    conditions. The idea is also to evoke the \"random conditions\" of nano universe."

    and also try a shape without crossing arms.

    ( flow ? ) of the logo but at the same time recalls one of the company missions
    : developping components which come at the crossing of many other components on
    a circuit... I would agree to say that this illustration has again something na\xEFve
    but also has the advantage to be quickly understandable by the members of this
    particular profession. ( And, again, I am really sorry for this kind of english
    )."

    circuit board, but it seem to me the idea behind it is neither well considered
    nor well executed. Perhaps you need to return to the idea stage?\r\n\r\nIn a serious
    business segment like this I would advice against a high school pun like \u201Cwe
    rock\u201D. At least that\u2019s  the impression I\u2019ve gotten from the customers
    I\u2019ve had in the microelectronics field. \r\n\r\nPS:\r\nI see I\u2019m the

  body: I totally agree with you, I would like to return to the idea stage but I made
    the mistake to show some boards and this one got the definitive attention of my
    client. The "we rock" thing is unhappily already in their name, and they decided
    it intentionally... But I also think nothing has to be rigid at the moment, so
    I will follow your suggestion and try something else. By the way, they also liked
    very much other elements I showed us... So I have to take that in count. May I
    show you what comes after your suggestions ?

  body: "I think the circuit idea works, and I like the forms of the letters except
    the /W. What if you try the circuit board hole circle as a ball terminal, maybe
    on the /r and /c inspired by this form: http://www.paratype.com/pictures/help/term/30.gif\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    a simple matching lower case /w would do the trick, and/or one looking more like
    /uu with 2 curved bottoms? \r\n\r\nFor a secondary font, try to pick something
    that is technical and a bit fun to reflect what seems to be the brand characteristics.
    Maybe look at the sommet family?\r\n\r\nI think this is a solid idea, but generating
    some other ideas is often very helpful even if you decide to refine this direction.
    \r\n\r\np.s. I really would drop the (k) - I get 'we rock' just fine without it.
    One too many concepts sometimes dilutes the value of them all."

  body: "Circle is indeed not perfectly circular, that is wanted. And the fact that
    it recalls old vinyls is also wanted. Those labels ( or chips ? ) will appear
    on electronic circuits in satellites or IRM scanners. The na\xEFve idea behind
    this is to remind the name of the company ( weeroc ). The particular context,
    in my humble opinion, makes it even more ridiculous to insist on the high-end
    technology side. We choose to underline the human side. But circular shape stays
    in the global meaning field ( wafer, chip, circuit termination, etc...).\r\n\r\nFor
    the (k) thing, advice was what I expected -and found !- but I didn't really expect
    observations like :\"unnecessary\" or \"ridiculous\". Kosher symbol ? It never
    displays like this- examples here : https://www.google.fr/search?q=kosher+symbols&hl=fr&rlz=1C1MACD_enFR499FR499&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=SaxAUIX1I5KwhAfp6ICQAg&sqi=2&ved=0CCQQsAQ&biw=1310&bih=766

  body: "Luma, I will fright you again in saying that the questions you ask are the
    questions I asked to myself.\r\n\r\n1) I understand very well that the frontier
    between \"standing out from the competition\" and \"being a bit silly/playful/cheeky\"
    is really thin. The first mistake I made was to post images, because what we have
    here are just directions, and I never considered them as being definitive displays.
    That said, on the music reference, I ask a new question : why the hell did the
    NASA sent a song from Mars to the Earth ? Many answers are available to answer
    the question, but among them, one seems very clear to me : music is \"human only\".
    But the circle is not just a record, it also recalls the Voyager Golden Record
    [[http://en.wikipedia.org|wiki|Voyager_Golden_Record]]\r\n\r\nAs a symbol, Voyager
    Program is the first program to illustrate the will of human beings to link  with
    the Universe. This said, we go to your second question\r\n\r\n2) The audience
    for the branding effort is people who do their job to touch a dream born with
    those space programs, and Voyager is their common legend. Happily, the circle
    symbol materializes the link between their \"dream\", their professional activity
    and their common specificity ( they are human beings ). During the briefing, the
    unperfect circle  immediately made them react positively because it also illustrates
    to them the \"quantic world\", where  human perception becomes like a trap. \r\n\r\nQuestion
    3 is \"the question of the moment\" : I have to have a big time working specifically
    on this.\r\n\r\nAnd... I agree the circle has to be farther distorted !"
