    can be very cool or very boring. It's cool when you use it where people don't

      And, yes that Univers chart is a classic.\r\nDo any of you <em>typonistas</em>
      think Univers somehow superior/preferable to Helvetica in either a technological
      or aesthetic manner?"

    (for me, helv and univers are neutral - AG has character). if a typeface is superior
    to another if its even more neutral - if thats the goal - then yes, univers is
    superior.\r\n\r\nmaybe, erik meant with \"more cool\" -> more neutral. less character
    in its shape, more neutrality."

  body: "Hi Henry\r\n\r\nTo get to the heart of Spiekermann's statement, I suggest
    you try setting the same text, preferably one in a foreign language* (maybe a
    hundred words at about 9 point and with a reasonable line length and leading value)
    in both Univers and Helvetica; print them out and compare them side by side. As
    you look at them, try and gauge them in relative terms of function, temperature
    or visual edge - which of the two appears to be more rational or more humanistic?
    which appears warmer or cooler? or softer or harder?\r\n* if you can't read it
    for sense, it will help you look at it objectively.\r\n\r\nI gave up long ago
    on expressing a preference for either one of these particular faces, but there
    are many <em>typographers</em> I know and respect who feel passionately about
    these things. There are also many alternatives to both Univers and Helvetica,
    since we are now nearly fifty years beyond their original release dates. Having
    said that, Bram's oblique reference to <a/href=\"http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/390030.html\">AG

    80th birthday. Amongst other things, there\u2019s an <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/en/2705-27594/may2008.html\">article
    by Akira Kobayashi on Univers vs. Helvetica</a>. You\u2019ll see how Univers\u2019
    spacing is much wider than Helvetica, which supposedly makes it more fit for text
    settings. More open counterforms and finer details give it that sharp look, which
    may be perceived by some people as overly \u201Ccold\u201D \u2013 but not to me.\r\n\r\n(As
    a side note: Linotype\u2019s Web site is terrible, I tried finding that article

    to the newsletter, in frustration)."

    in that it touches other aspects of Frutiger\u2019s life apart from type design.
    It\u2019s not too long (about 40 minutes) and I quite enjoyed it. As far as I
    know this is as close as it gets to a biography, but keep also in mind that the
    man wrote a lot of books: I recommend you try to find a copy of <cite>Type Sign

    that reminds me of an old thread I'll usually go back and add my suggestion. It

    of Frutiger when I posted the pic of the Concorde, but I think the idea (and shape)
    stands. Frutiger is French-ish, to use an absolutely awful expression that I may
    have just made up. Univers is not some old German clunker, it's sleek, new, sexy,
    and yes, cool...in a late 60's French-sort-of-way. It's power was in what it replaced,
    which is hard to know about today.\r\n\r\nI could also make the jab that Univers
    is to Segoe as Concorde is to Boeing 787. Some Boeing fans might interpret that
