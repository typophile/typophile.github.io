  named Kres to design a logotype for their corporation. They are a leading advertising
  company in my country and would like somewhat tycoonish look. Nevertheless, they
  have a predilection for style, like all of us.  <BR>I would like you to review this
  logotypes and come up with ideas/suggestions to strengthen  <BR>the appeal. Please
  feel free to critisize the work harshly and I am free to accept it or disregard

  body: Galin, could you give some background on the agency. Is it full service or
    does it specialize in an area like print or direct response. Any reason for the
    arrows in number one. What does Kres mean is it a family name?  <BR>Versions 3
    and 5 don&#39;t read. <BR>Have you done any research into compeating ad agencies
    to see what they are doing with their marketing? It amazes me these days people
    design before any sound marketing has been done.

    one has some potential, but like Daniel asked, what does it all mean &#40;arrow,

    <BR>  Now about the agency. Kres specialized in every single aspect of the modern/contemporary
    advertising. Print, TV commercials, Web design, etc. Main clients include : Banks,
    Television companies, chief brands&#40;like Nike, Adidas, Coca Cola, Nestle, Dolce
    &amp; Gabana, Prada, KIA, Opel, Ford, etc. <BR>  Every logotype I did has a reason.
    The first one focuses on the prefered color, which is red and the arrows create
    a subtle logotype, which is not so straightforward but is perceivable. <BR>  On
    the second one there is a K, in white&#40;with stroke&#41; and a diamond&#40;with
    a greenish tint&#41;. <BR>  The third logotype symbolizes the ideology of the
    corporation, which is the Art of Craft &#40;they are great zealots of tools&#41;.
    <BR>  The fifth contains scissors forming the K. <BR>  On every logo there is
    &#34;K&#34;. <BR> <BR>  Please critisize freely <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    <BR>P.S The project is still in progress, so I can revise the logotypes. They
    are currently being viewed by the Creative director of the advertising agency,
    but that doesn&#39;t omit the possibility of revisions.'

  body: First one has good potential, the rest lack balance and/or legibility. I am
    gathering the firm is based in the eastern block &#40;russia?&#41; . This makes
    it a challenge for me to critique. As much of the current design from the region
    is not to my personal liking &#40;which in this situation makes no difference&#41;.
    <BR>As you know it important that the design appeals to people in the region or
    at least the firm&#39;s clients. So what works? <BR>Hard to say. Start with thinking,
    make a list of all the attributes and values the firm has. What kind of work/clients
    does the firm like to get. Etc.. <BR>Once the identity is done, consider changing
    the site as it has too much useless/time wasting graphics when entering.

    a designer and I didn&#39;t see it when I posted my first post. Communications
    are clear, not just cleaver. So be clear first then, cleaver. Those are some nice
    clients and all corporations you might want to create something more upscale.
    Think about process not just design. examples: Silver mylar stamping on an uncoated
    paper or maybe a heated blind emboss of the name. Thats the problem of only designing

  body: I see the &#34;K&#34;, but that doesn&#39;t explain the arrow&#40;s&#41;.
    Design with purpose. If you are going to use the &#34;K&#34; to create an arrow,
    why? Why create an arrow? I think it&#39;s a great element, so why not capitalize
    on it. Give the arrow some meaning/purpose. For example, it could represent fast
    turnaround, response time, driving your message to your target, always moving
    forward, and so on. Think beyond the aesthetic. <BR> <BR>I still think that first
    design has some great potential. You might try experimenting with some alternative
    typefaces to unite with that mark &#40;Arrow-K&#41;. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: 'As others have said, toss all of them but variation #1. <BR> <BR>Version
    01 reminds me of nautical flags/sports wear. I understand the &#60; shape and
    the K being similar, but I can&#39;t stop thinking of Nautica and Tommy Hilfiger.
    It&#39;s also the navy blue and red with white type. I prefer the version on the
    business card, because the blue arrow doesn&#39;t show. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d use V01
    as a start and explore type, like Scott said. Copperplate Gothic &#40;that&#39;s
    what you&#39;re using, right?&#41; is a solid face, but it&#39;s got a dated look
    and is used by a lot of novice designers and pseudo-designers who pull their type
    from the default menus. Again, it&#39;s not <i>bad</i> per se, but an agency of
    that size and breadth should use a more exclusive, &#39;designer&#39;s favorite&#39;
    typeface. The style of Copperplate works, but another face could work much better.
    Because the logo is abstract geometry, the type provides a lot of the communication
    and message. <BR> <BR>Also, the arrow shapes are pointing to the left, which signifies
    &#40;for me, as an American&#41; rewinding or going backwards. <BR> <BR>Keep exploring,
    and good luck.'

  body: 'Knockout D could be good, it&#39;s very strong, etc. But I&#39;d probably
    choose faces of a different sort. Though, your explorations generally show that
    the typeface may not be the issue. <BR> <BR>Look at #1 and #1b, for example. They
    are both using generally the same shapes with different typefaces. Then look at
    the other three. I don&#39;t see what they&#39;re all trying to do for Kres. I
    think you have some more fundamental explorations to do before taking them to
    such a polished level &#40;color, type, kerning, etc.&#41;. All of the logos say
    something, but they all don&#39;t say anything specific enough for my tastes.
    You are constructing a series of completed logos, but I don&#39;t detect a strong
    visual theme. I&#39;m not implying you&#39;re not doing a good job, or working
    hard, but you seem to be firing in the dark at your target. What&#39;s happening
    is that you&#39;re making the mark equally important to the type, without a strong
    connection between them, or a smooth coexistance. I like 2 and 4 because 2 allows
    the mark to take over and 4 makes the graphic mark and type come together. The
    symbol in 1 and 1b is cool, but the type isn&#39;t tied in &#40;or as interesting
    as the mark&#41;. For that mark, I&#39;d avoid serifs completely. Additionally,
    you could move &#39;advertising&#39; over to the left and extend the bottom ovoid
    shape in 1b down to cover the &#39;ad&#39; in &#39;advertising&#39; instead of
    using a new circle. Or even use the bottom leg of the K to do that. Not sure if
    that&#39;ll work. <BR> <BR>If you go with the #1b mark &#40;I prefer it to #1&#41;,
    try <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/cyclone/index.html">Cyclone</a>
    or <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO&amp;sub=inuse">Neutra</a>,
    or maybe <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALOBLI-FO&amp;sub=view">Chalet</a>.
    Something simple and strong, but with a slight European, hip twist or curve. You
    can probably see I&#39;m going with condensed faces generally. Take a risk. And
    these are just my first few suggestions. I chose them because I looked at your
    client list and thought: global, dynamic, hip but not trendy, contemporary, elegant
    but not elderly or historic. Look to the younger, and/or hipper font houses, also
    the independents &#40;do a search on this board, or buy <a href="http://www.p22.com/indiefonts/">Indie
    Fonts</a>&#41;. Step a bit further outside of the norm. <BR> <BR>I also agree
    with Scott&#39;s statements about keeping the K more apparent if you use the echelon
    shapes from the original variation 1. <BR> <BR>I can see you know the general
    feeling you want. Keep pushing. Hope this helps.'

    Also, I prefer the circle to the oval, but I don&#39;t have a strong reason for
    that preference. <BR> <BR>The pricetag idea seems more shopping oriented, but
    if you and the client like it, then keep going. Close up the word space between

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The font choice is extremely important. The design
    of the letterforms can evoke associations and emotional reactions that have to
    do with a variety of factors. Try putting Bodoni or Centaur by the logo, then
    use Officina or Scala Sans. The logo mark you&#39;ve designed doesn&#39;t really
    say anything specific, so the associations could be very wide and different. The
    type helps to clarify the image. <BR> <BR>Here are a few quick versions I threw
    together that are loosely in the direction I was thinking. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52477.gif"
    alt="KRES logo examples"> <BR> <BR>These examples use Scala Sans Bold and Caps.
    The condensed faces didn&#39;t look as good as I thought they would. I think the
    simplicity is the important part here. Also, the font is a modern and clean sans,
    but humanist in some of its construction. That softens the impression a bit and
    lets the san serif feel more at home with a mark that&#39;s so curved. It&#39;s
    <i>all</i> about the type choice, in my opinion.
