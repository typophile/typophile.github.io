body: "Hi, everybody. \r\n\r\nI'm branching off into freelance design and wanted to
  create a mark that was simple and vibrant. I think I succeeded with the graphical
  portion of my idea, but less so with the self-made typeface. Feel free to tell me
  otherwise on either account.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThis is my first typeface and it
  was positioned to me by a friend that the font had too little in common with the
  mark. I, though not as knowledgeable as the other fellow, thought that I was going
  for a juxtaposition of elements in an effort to make them stand out. A secondary
  concern was that the font should look at home next to its web-friend Verdana.\r\n\r\nFrenden
  Design is the primary logo here. The others are two side projects that I thought
  might be fun to keep in the same family, looks-wise. The three pronged design helped
  with that to an extent.\r\n\r\nA few of the letterforms on my home-brew font are
  too similar and would be hard to read at small sizes. I intend on fixing that if
  things are working at all. If they aren't working out so well together, why bother?\r\n\r\nThe
  only conceptual comment regarding the logo that I have is, my name is Ray and the
  logo sort of has the feel of rays of sunlight.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for feedback
  left; sorry if I over explained. I have that tendency."

  body: "Ray, I think you have to experiment more with the form of your logo. It`s
    raw at the moment and viewer can`t allocate the form. And of course it`s difficult
    to create for self. Type and logo doesn`t harmonize together, that`s the fact.
    This type required a more rectangular and bold logo and simply form. Probably
    try to go to 3th demension with actually design:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kahlkopf.com/files/experiment.gif\r\n\r\nAn
    example of logo and corporate (adapted font):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kahlkopf.com/deu/programm/\r\n\r\nPS:
    your \"R\" is russian \"ja\" = I, me.\r\n"

  body: "\"And of course it`s difficult to create for self.\"\r\n\r\nI have the worst
    time deciding on something I like for my own marketing materials.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the feedback. I really like the top row, middle example you provided. The
    symmetry is nice; I experimented in a similar way with less stellar results before
    opting for what I'd shown you.\r\n\r\nIf I do stick with a new variation of the
    angular, more abstract logo  any suggestions on a font that might work better?
    I've drawn up a few that have the same oblong wonkiness and their lack of uniformity
    really bothered me.\r\n\r\nWadim, I really like the backwards R. I've been playing
    with the form for awhile in a second type attempt tentatively titled propagander.
    I'm a big fan of WWII propaganda posters and I was thinking of moving towards
    that side of things (In a really abstract way, the backwards R even almost looks
    like a capital F and R combined which are my initials.). The meaning behind it,
    which is something I was intending to look up, is pretty fitting. I thank you
    for providing it.\r\n\r\nYou've definitely given me some food for thought, both
    of you. Thanks."

  body: "http://www.penguinx.org/forum_pics/logo_mockup.gif\r\n\r\nAlright, here are
    a two sketches from a slew of them that I did this morning. One still clings to
    the sharp, abstracted form of the first concept, and the other plays off the backwards
    R character.\r\n\r\nThe abstracted one I intended to give the impression of an
    R and F, but I was more interested in trying to come up with an appropriate typeface
    for a logo of that kind. The kerning wasn't meant to be so tight; it's pretty
    rough.\r\n\r\nBoth rough, but I think both have some potential."

    in some way to create a mark?

  body: Quick question, I'm in the home stretch of posting a few new ideas, but is
    it best to have a mark when you're a freelancer, or is that reserved for positioning
    yourself as a studio, only? I know it's frowned upon in things like resumes and
    what have you...

      Schmidt then as \"we at the Advanced Storm Studios..\"\r\nJoke. :o)\r\n\r\nI`m
      freelancer, but officially registred as \"Design Embassy\".\r\nBut I decided
      to go as \"Wadim Kahlkopf | freelancer Art Director \r\n| visual communication\".
      Design firms tends to go work with freelancer, because they are cheaper. Firm
      outside are loooking more for firms as freelancer even it coasts more, because
      they often think that freelancer can`t do all what they want, he is an amateur.
      \r\nSo you must decide the way you go.\r\n"
