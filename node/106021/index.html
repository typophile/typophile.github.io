It's too swooshy for Victorian. 
You could make something similar by using a fat Caslon like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suomi/grumpy/">Grumpy </a> [loosely based on based on <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-grouch/">ITC Grouch</a>  by Tom Carnase] as a base, expanding the width and stretching the serifs to a point.

		<div class="commentbody">This really does put me in mind of something that may have been originally done by a sign painter, all those sharp serifs look like they came from a chisel brush and that R really does seem to have a brushed quality about it. Although, the repeated letters appear just a little too identical, so it may well have been digitised later. 

My feeling is that it's got to have some connection to a form of sign writer's Roman, not one that I can immediately find though! 

Mmm... Delta Spur or Taroca - Nah, maybe not!

You may be right but I guess, even if it's pretty well done, Don's enhanced version comes from a cropped/expanded [[http://www.henhamsteamrally.com/userimages/2013_leaflet.png|LD (72dpi) 306x643px leaflet cover]] which could explain the small differences that actually I can't even see :D

		<div class="commentbody">The differences are not that small. For instance, the /R in the top line has a curve on the leg which stops at the baseline while the /R in the bottom line goes below the baseline. It also appears there may be a slight difference in the slope of the left side of the leg of the /R. The top serif in the /A in the second line has a different shape and slightly different length than the /A in the third line (same for the /M). In the word "RALLY" the bottom-right serif on the two /L's are different in length plus there is a slight different in the overall width of the two /L's.</div>

Again, you may be right. I'm probably too much stubborn and frustrated not to find anything on this lettering that I can't even accept what should be definitely evident that I don't know it :D
Actually, I'm still convinced these (minor and blurry) differences are due to Don's sample reworking :D
May be asking directly via their website would be our last chance to solve this mystery...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes the reworking is less than perfect.  There are always tradeoffs in enhancement, which in this case is an attempt to make a larger image that conforms to what the human eye sees in the small image, rather than the blurry result of a larger image produced by simple magnification. 
If one attempts to make the tapered ends stand out the letters become too bold and outline detail is lost, such as the notch where the leg of R joins the bowl. I chose to try and preserve the outline as close as possible to what the human eye sees in the original small image. This means that bolding produced during the process must be reduced. This has the side effect of truncating the long tapered ends. I restored them by sketching them back in as lines by hand. I did not make other changes.
As for the variation among letters, I find it really difficult to decide whether it exists or is a result of this process. Anyway, I don't see anything to dispute in Ryuk's summary.
Even if the originals are identical this does not mean it is a font.
A hand lettered alphabet can be photographed and images collated and repeated as required to make words.
Nothing new about this.
The brushwork style on the leg of R and the serifs suggests the use of a showcard alphabet. In addition to the Atkinson and Becker books there were a lot of printed specimens by other lettering artists. Some research might find it.
It would be an interesting project to use this as a basis for a neo-nostalgia font. The missing letters are an exercise for the inquiring mind. For example a Q with a tail derived from R.
In sum, my vote based on the information we have so far, is for lettering rather than a font as the probable source.  Look forward George to whatever information the organizers might be able to give to you.

Wish I had now, I could have got a better scan up.

If it isn't a font I'm gutted because I wont it, I've spent most of this week researching the sign and probibly know more about the event than the organisers plus I've probibly got their search rankings up too.

I've contacted the organisers but no luck yet. If I find out more I'll share it out, if it is a sign-writer then I'll approach/commission a full font and digitise it.</div>

I finally heard back from them too, several days ago, but couldn't post their reply because typophile's servers have been out of reach for me. I've complained about that but so far they are still really slow. Tonight was my first actual successful access in several days.

Best to start would probably be to know which design studio did the last collaterals and leaflet, contact them and ask gently if they could provide the lettering as vector.
