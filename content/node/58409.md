  any point in adding the [[aalt]] feature?  Say it was:\r\n\r\nfeature aalt {\r\n
  \ feature liga;\r\n  feature calt;\r\n  feature salt;\r\n} aalt;\r\n\r\nmy fonts
  seem to work the same whether I put it in or not.  The only reason I can think of
  for it is to order the other features - ie ligatures get processed before contextual
  alternates, but they seem to anyway, regardless of the position of the liga feature
  in the aalt feature.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?"

    way for glyph insert palettes, such as that in InDesign, to be able to present
    all the variant forms of a given glyph in a fly-out UI. At the time, they thought
    the way to do this would be to put all the variants into a single feature, so
    that the glyph palette could simply query that feature to present the variants.\r\n\r\nBut
    some of use didn't play ball :) -- and started shipping fonts without implementing
    the 'aalt' feature, and Adobe's app developers did the sensible thing: they wrote
    the glyph palette code to query all the GSUB layout features and harvest the one-to-one
    variants that way.\r\n\r\nSo, from my perspective, there is no need to implement
    the 'aalt' feature. That said, Adobe continue to put this feature in all their
    fonts, and I'm guessing there is probably a processing benefit, in terms of speed
    and memory resources, if the glyph palette can grab the variants from this one
    feature. It also probably means you have some control over what variants are presented
    in the glyph palette."

    but how they appear. In cases where, for whatever reason, the various alternates
    appear in the Glyphs palette in a strange order, we can specify all the alternates
    in a specific order in 'aalt'.\r\n\r\nI can't remember exact cases, or if it's
    even much of an issue anymore... but we did this most often with the various figure
    styles, where we might have three alternates like fitted oldstyle, etc., and also
    numerators, etc. We would sometimes see these alternates appearing in an unpleasant
    order in the Glyphs flyout. We would \"hardcode\" the desired order in 'aalt'
    to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThere was also a time when we would put certain alternate
    substitutions in 'aalt' if we wanted to see them but they didn't appear in other
    features. Eventually we decided that such substitutions should find a home in
    some \"real\" layout feature rather than 'aalt', so we try not to do that anymore."
