  that it was Fifth Avenue font, but the only \"fifth avenue\" font i could find was
  called Fifth Avenue Salon NF and it didn't look like this. \r\n\r\nAny help I could
  get would be great."

    with some serious horizontal scale.\r\n\r\nI'm almost positive this font is a
    knockoff but for some reason I can't think of right now... I can feel an 'oh duh'
    moment when someone points it out."

  body: Oh junk, I knew it. Got hung up searching for 'delphin' and 'engraved' on
    myfonts that turned me sideways. Thanks Mike... at least I can rest peacefully
    tonight.

  body: Wow, thanks guys. That is probably it, but they stretched it out horizontally
    a bit. Thanks for all of your help.
