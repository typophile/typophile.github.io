  I am a new graphic design student from Sydney so at this stage I will probably ask
  more questions than providing answers but hopefully that will change soon.\r\n\r\nI
  have to do a design audit, comparing the two coffee companies and I need to find
  out what logo font they are using (see attachment). Have they been especially created?\r\n\r\nAlso
  - maybe you can help me: I am puzzled why the logo Vittoria is in a 30 degree angle?\r\n\r\nWhat
  significance has that? And how about the bar on the left of the Vittoria logo? Is
  that just to draw you to the logo?\r\n\r\nRe Lavazza logo: Looks like a logo for
  Ben Hur!! Why would they emphasize the A so much?\r\n\r\nCan't wait to read what
  you have to say...not sure how I will find out about it? Do I log in again? Btw
  - ned to finish the audit over the weekend.\r\n\r\nMANY THANKS,\r\n\r\nUte\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Andreas,\r\n\r\nWie geht's?\r\n\r\nThere is heaps on google but not what
    font it is, marketing people & designer of both companies were willing to talk
    to me at first but then ran out of time after all (well, I am \"just\" a student...)
    \r\n\r\nFound out about italic font (from Italy) - of course appropriate for an
    Italian coffee, bold font makes words stand out more, etc, etc\r\n\r\nVittoria's
    font looks very similar to Brush script Std or Brussels (except for the V). Lavazza
    could be something like a modified Autumn?\r\n\r\nI don't have all available fonts
    on my computer.\r\n\r\nHelp is very much appreciated! MANY thanks,\r\n\r\nUte\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ute, concerning Lavazza, stop looking for a computer font and take the time
    to read. First read carefully about the [[http://www.lavazza.com/corporate/en/lavazzastyle/design/logo|Lavazza
    Logo Timeline]] on Lavazza's site; in particular this logo is dated 1950:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lavazza_logo1950_5776.jpg]\r\nIf
    you look at the [[http://www.lavazza.com/corporate/en/company/history/1933-1955.html|Lavazza
    1933-1955]] history page, you see at the right this logo from 1945-1946. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/storia_logo_lavazza_5788.gif]\r\nIf
    you just look for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavazza|Lavazza on Wikipedia]]
    you get this picture from the beginning of the 19th certury: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lavazza_0002782_m.jpg|La
    grande storia...]]. Look at the logo on the bottom left. I call that a company
    with a sense of continuity.\r\n\r\nNow [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator|Adobe
    Illustrator]] dates from 1986. There were no digital fonts in the 1950s. There
    were no electronic computers outside \"laboratories\" in 1945-46.\r\n"

    do the research for your Australian brand (ok, I confess, I am a Lavazza coffee
