  body: I find it fun, although the traps lose their point. But I imagine whoever
    did it must find that it gives a different to what could be an otherwise regular
    sans.

  body: Traps are sexy when added to the design in a conscious and thoughtful way.
    Why have such a detail and <em>not</em> use it huge?

    AM getting better at this game. ;^)\r\n\r\nRe. the traps, personally I agree with
    the previous replies. I  think these traps look pretty tasty at headline sizes
    along with Carter's swashy Big Caslon."

    a font that is crafted to work optimally in 6 points in a telephone book but as
    long it is done intentionally with some sort of thoughts behind it... why not?
    \r\nRock on"
