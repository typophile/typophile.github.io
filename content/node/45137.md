body: " a while back, I designed a web site for a group restoring a WWII Lancaster
  bomber. The site is due for some restoration, redesign and improvements. (they let
  the domain name laps) \r\n\r\nAny suggestions for fonts? \r\n\r\nweb page text choices
  are obviously limited. So I just want it to be readable. A significant number of
  older viewers with dated operating systems. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the site, I'll
  also be addressing a logo (or, perhaps more correctly, a badge), various page elements,
  some banners, and some merchandise things (hats, mugs, shirts etc.), where I'll
  have more freedom to pick and choose fonts. \r\n\r\nThe airplane itself was built
  in Toronto in late 1944 and was in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1945 to 1965.
  (interesting trivia: the Canadian-built Lancasters had round headed rivets, which
  made them 30MpH slower than their British-built counter parts with flush rivets.)
  It sat in a supply depot until the end of the war. In the post war years it was
  used variously in Cold-War anti-submarine patrols and search and as a rescue plane.
  It's being restored to 1945 condition and is and will continue to be an official
  war monument, so that's primarily the era I want to draw references from, with some
  things from the 50s and 60s thrown in for good measure. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n

    about three years ago someone recommended your site for retro fonts. I looked
    at it, then promptly forgot the name and link and have been looking for it off
    and on ever since. Nice stuff.\r\n\r\nDave. :o) thanks for catching my typo. Nice
    thing about the first post is that editing it won't re-position it.\r\n"
