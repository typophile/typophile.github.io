  used a wacom to draw these in Illustrator, then copy/pasted into fontlab. I wish
  I could just work in fontlab, but it doesn't do the brushy/pressure thing I need,
  AFAIK\r\n\r\nI can post .ttf files if anyone wants to install. Any feedback would
  be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Ben"

  body: nice stuff, will you make the rest of glyphs as well? i was wondering, how
    do you copy paste from illustrator to fontlab, i mean the proper way.

    sure if it's the \"proper\" way, and I do notice that fontlab slightly changes
    my beziers, but I'm still satisfied with the result."

  body: "IMO... doesn't really look like anything I've ever seen in graffiti.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    why it doesn't work for me is that graffiti lettering is as diverse, as say, beer,
    and like beer, your major locales have their own flavor of graffiti that are largely
    the sum of the dominant cultural influences of these places. \r\n\r\nWhile there
    are some really cool letters in your alphabet (I really like your Q and your period),
    I think it would help to learn a bit about the things that influence graffiti
    letters rather than trying to pigeonhole graffiti into a certain look.\r\n\r\nFor
    example, LA graffiti draws a huge influence from gang graffiti, much of which
    is rooted in Gothic letters. Combine that with the need to do it quickly on public
    spaces and the limitations of spray paint, the form itself began to evolve. Artist
    Chaz Bojorquez took what kids were doing on the streets and combined it with the
    techniques of Chinese calligraphy to take it to another level.\r\n\r\nAnd LA graffiti
    is vastly different from stuff on the streets of NYC, Sao Paolo, Philly, etc.
    It's good to know what makes em different as much as what they have in common."
