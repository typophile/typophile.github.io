body: "As you may have noticed from the critique section, we are digitizing Alf Becker's
  268th demonstration lettering Modern Spencerian Script, from <em>Signs of the Times</em>
  magazine from May of 1954. \r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/64373|Alf Becker's
  lower case]]\r\n\r\nAs a demonstration of the script for artists, it was great.
  For digitizing, it has been - difficult. The lower case f is a prime example. The
  forward down stroke is almost completely inconsistent with the rest of the lettering.
  \ This was okay for brush work because everything was adjusted on the fly by the
  artist. But, for creating a consistantly usable letter it is difficult...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alfs_5952.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  is what we came up with as our baseline f and fits all characters, esp bhijklt.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/baseline_6143.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  one is an alternate for acdegmnopqrsuvwxyz has a shorten crossbar.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/altf1_3563.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
  alternate overlapping ligatures of bhijk \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/altf2_5603.jpg]\r\n\r\nFinally,
  actual ligatures...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lig1_3746.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lig2_4947.jpg]\r\n\r\nWe
  are also considering another, scripty lower case for purists. I think that might
  cover all of the bases. Did I miss anything? This is just for the lower case f.
  How many ligatures are normal, or rational, for a script.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

    the only uncomfortable ones. Maybe try making the beak of the \"f\" flatter and
    longer, and making the ascenders of \"b\"/\"h\" shorter, to fit underneath.\r\n\r\nAnd
    in the second \"ff\" I'd make the first \"f\" shorter.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
