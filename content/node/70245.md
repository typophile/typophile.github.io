  body: "Much better with the brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\nCouple of observations on the latest
    image:\r\n\r\n-I like the stress you have in the lowercase letters, but it doesn't
    seem consistent. The thinnest parts at the joints of the 'r,' 'm,' 'u,' etc. don't
    match the thinnest parts of letters like the 'a' and the 'g.' The 'S' in general,
    and particularly the spine, strike me as being too thick as compared to the thickest
    parts of the 'Q' and the 'C.'\r\n\r\n-The top terminal of the 'c' is much larger
    than those of the 'C,' 'S,' and 's,' which are all different from the one on the
    'r.' The one on the 'f' seems to be having its own party. Personally, I like the
    one on the 'r' the best.\r\n\r\n-The serifs on that 'K' are huge. o_O\r\n\r\n\r\nOn
    the old image:\r\n\r\n-The diagonal of the z's seems too thick, and I wonder what
    they would look like if either the bottom or top serifs (not both at the same
    time though) resembled more the top terminals of letters like 'c,' 'r,' etc.\r\n\r\n-I
    have no idea why, but the 'x' looks backwards. I know it's not, but something
    about it makes it seem like it's the mirror version of what an 'x' should look
    like.\r\n\r\n-Maybe I'm just seeing things, but the 'S,' the 'Q,' and the 'C'
    look like they're sitting just a smidge too high on the baseline (in both the
    old and new image).\r\n"

  body: "I'm digging what you've got so far. The mixture of curvy/pointed finials
    and the wide, adnate serifs combine to make a nice overall visual. I think some
    of the awkwardness of the letterforms comes from the curved letterforms not dropping
    below the baseline. The bowl of the /a/, /d/, etc. should dip just a little bit
    below the baseline/above the x-height when compared to the serifs of a letter
    such as an /m/... this balances the visual weight of the letters. In the word
    \"Quagmire\" the /a/ seems a lot smaller when compared to the /u/. I might also
    suggest reducing the size of the finial on /l/ as it's much larger than most of
    the other letters.\r\n\r\nThe face is coming along nicely. Thought about naming
    it yet?"

  body: "Yeah it was hard to tell at that size for some reason (for the bowls etc.)\r\n\r\nAs
    for the /B/... I definitely prefer the last one. The crossbar on both the /P/
    and /R/ are both in the same vein, in that they have two corner points, so I think
    the /B/ should follow that paradigm, if it remains disconnected. You could also
    have /B/ be the only character of the three that actually has a connected crossbar,
    as a lot of faces seem to do that."

  body: "Things are coming together quite nicely.\r\n\r\nThe only glaring things I
    now see: the bottom part of the /C/ seems a bit too short... it looks like it's
    slightly rotated to the right as if it's tipping over; The /Z/ also looks a bit
    top-heavy, especially when compared to its lowercase counterpart; and lastly the
    /?/ also looks off-balance, almost as if it belongs in an italic version. On a
    personal note, I think the bottom part of the /2/ needs some type of terminal
    on the right side as you did with the crossbar of the /4/. Maybe end it the same
    way you did with the top of the /7/? Not sure how it'd look, but it's worth a
    shot. i think my favorite letter is either the /K/ or the /R/, both look great.\r\n\r\nedit:
    Just noticed the descender on the /j/... it looks just a tad funky compared with
    the elegance of the g/q/y. Maybe try emulating those more elegant curves there,
    too."

    Jenson.\r\n\r\nI attempted to describe how to fix the /z/ but it just wasn't working
    with words, so here's a super quick visual. Basically your points at the joints
    of the stem didn't line up right so the strokes looked disconnected:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/z-01_3526.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
    obviously not perfect as the stem needs to be thickened up a bit to match your
    /y/, but I think it illustrates what I was trying to explain."

    You''re lining that stroke up to the bottom one, but it makes the shape of the

    more circular. '

    curve of the diagonal on the z throws it off a bit from the rest of the characters.\r\n\r\nand
    I agree with omatveeva about the x. putting the little flick on all the ends makes
    it look like four separate strokes. I'd keep the make the terminals of the bottom
    left - top right stroke straight like the u.\r\n\r\nthe italic k is very well
    done. it's graceful. also, the italic a,d,b,p,q are all very charming."

  body: "Hey, your font is looking pretty good. I have a few critiques, but I'm also
    a beginner so take them with a grain of salt. I'll start with the roman:\r\n\r\nLowercase:\r\n-
    All of your upper serifs in the lowercase, with the exception of diagonal letters,
    are contradictory to the lower serifs, and all serifs in the uppercase. These
    serifs are thin, curved, and bracketed, whereas the others are dark and abrupt.\r\n-
    The diagonal letters - /z/x/v/w/z/ - all extend too high. The reach where round
    letters should overlap, and not at the optical x-height.\r\n- You may want to
    make the transition on letters like /n/ slightly darker. (The top right where
    the curve transitions into the right stem.)\r\n- Terminals on /a/, /r/, and /s/
    should be darker as they are on /c/\r\n\r\nUppercase:\r\n- The O and Q are much
    darker than other letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, your font is quite good, although
    probably needs some refinement. Most of the curves seem to be a bit wobbly, this
    is because of the construction used when making them. The extrema should be at
    the most logical point in a curve. I like to think of it as making curves appear
    natural, but it's hard to explain. I may be able to post an image describing this
    later. Also, I would recommend looking carefully at the weight of each letter
    and trying to balance the color of all letters.\r\n\r\nYour font reminds me a
    bit of Newton, a font I am making, but only certain parts.\r\n\r\nGood luck with
    your font!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    than your roman. The main problem with /x/ is that the strokes are the same width.
    The stroke starting at the top left should be thin."
