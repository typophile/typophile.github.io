body: "Do you have recent experience doing copyright registrations for fonts with
  the US Copyright Office?\r\n\r\nSome specific questions:\r\n\r\nThe Copyright Office
  wants the source code of the font deposited. That's easy to understand for a C++
  program, but what do they expect to see as \"source code\" for a font created using
  Fontographer (so glad it's available for OS X finally)? Or FontLab?\r\n\r\nIf I
  create a font in Fontographer, and distribute a TrueType font that I generated using
  Fontographer, does the Copyright Office want the .fog file? Or the .ttf file? Or
  something else entirely? The .fog file seems like it's basically the \"source code\",
  though it's utterly unreadable if I just open it in a text editor.\r\n\r\nThere's
  a cryptic sentence on a few sites about the Copyright Office being reluctant to
  accept registrations of fonts created using Fontographer -- has anyone actually
  run into that?\r\n\r\nFinally, for a dingbat font where I want the copyright registration
  to also protect the selection and arrangement of non-alphabetic glyphs (the a slot
  is filled by a diamond, the b slot is filled by a horse), do you have any experience
  with the Copyright Office accepting or rejecting language to that effect on the
  registration form?\r\n\r\nI've just spent most of the last day looking for answers
  to these questions unsuccessfully on the web and in books. Any advice would be very
  welcome!"

    ten and last ten pages to the (c) office. Don't know how about the forms - our
    legal people take care of that for us. \r\n\r\nWith respect to glyph order - got
    a feeling that might be a design patent thing not a (c) thing as we've not done
    that in a while.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't know about your last question.\r\n\r\nFor Type 1 fonts, IIRC, what
    Adobe used to file with the copyright office was a dump of an unencrypted version
    of a PFA file.\r\n\r\nFor OpenType CFF fonts or CFF fonts, one could dump tables
    of the compiled font, in order, using a tool such as TTX.\r\n\r\nIn all cases,
    one only needs to submit the first 25 pages and last 25 pages. More details are
    on the copyright office's site. (or is it 10 and 10 like Microsoft? I could be
    misremembering.)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: It's first and last 25 pages now, according to Circular 61 at the Copyright
    Office (www.loc.gov). Their info is pretty good about traditional software, but
    hard to apply to fonts. This is helping a lot, thank you!
