body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nNever asked for a font ID before, but to be honest I have no
  idea how else to find this out. While in St. Prex, Switzerland, we visited a gallery
  which had this poster outside. The typeface is beautiful! I'd love to know what
  it is - can anyone help?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/andi_id_1_4281.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/andi_id_2_5559.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance - sorry if it's something really obvious. Both me and my girlfriend thought
  it looked familiar, but couldn't place it.\r\n\r\nAndi [<a href='http://www.semibad.com'>semibad</a>]"

    (sometimes) not knowing it ;-)\r\n\r\nShame they didn't use the lining figures
    for the date in the first image."
