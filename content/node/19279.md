    the entire notion of \"Google bombs\" might be better described as \"link bombing,\"
    given that these campaigns can certainly have an effect on other search engines,
    as well. All major search engines make use of link analysis and thus can be impacted.
    So, a search for \"miserable failure\" on June 1, 2005 brought up the official
    George W. Bush biography number one on Google, Yahoo and MSN and number two on
    Ask Jeeves. On June 2, 2005, Yooter reported that George Bush is now ranked first
    for the keyword 'failure' as well as 'miserable failure' in both Google and Yahoo.
