    sounds good to me. Also similar to <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=diotima+sc&x=0&y=0&sample_text=Faber%20Castell&sample_size=60\">Diotima</a>,
    another calligraphic typeface by [[Gudrun Zapf von Hesse]]. Keep in mind that
    this is a logo: the letters may have undergone some modification, if not custom
    drawn in the first place.\r\n\r\nF"

  body: maybe he's annoyed at the kinda blatant misspelling of FABER-castell twice
    in a post? or maybe he doesn't like huge images resulting in horizontal scrollbars?
