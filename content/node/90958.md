  body: I still can't believe Arial is supposed to be analogous to Helvetica.  They're
    almost complete different if you ask me.

  body: I only really noticed the differences when someone enlarged the letters and
    then overlaid them one on top of the other, then it was astonishingly obvious.
    Where I work has both fonts but people seem to interchange them without any thought
    and it winds me up.

  body: Arial is so much colder and more sterile.  That's not always a bad thing,
    depending on what project you're working on.

  body: As I learned from another thread on this forum, Arial was designed to have
    the same metrics as Helvetica, but the face itself was derived by Monotype from
    Monotype Grotesque.
