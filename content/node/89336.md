  body: Wow, that's really helpful, thank you.  One of these will definitely do for
    my purposes.  How did you find them?  I don't seem to be able to find a way to
    search for typefaces by period.  Not "period style" but actual design period,
    especially for the 19th century.  Any tips?

  body: "When you have an image of a font/logo you can use a number of special software
    tools to match the visual image of the font against a font database.\r\n\r\nOne
    way is to use the WhatTheFont service: http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\r\nIt
    requires a clean image of black letters on white background and the letters must
    be \"disconnected\" e.g. if you have a script font you have to pre-process the
    image and add some white space between letters.\r\nThe basic advantage of WhatTheFont
    is their large database but it will only match fonts they actually sell - not
    free fonts nor any other fonts you may have in your computer.\r\n\r\nIn your case
    I used a different tool called Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com\r\n(I'm
    the chief designer & developer of the Find my Font tool).\r\nFind my Font can
    match a font image against any fonts you have in your computer (installed or not)
    and it works directly on any color image or screen capture - no need for pre-processing.
    It can search e.g. 200.000 fonts in 10 secs.\r\nIf you have a large collection
    of fonts in your computer, go and try the <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/download/compare-editions|free-trial
    of Find my Font]]</strong> - I think you will find it interesting.\r\n\r\nGlad
    to be of help\r\nFivos"
