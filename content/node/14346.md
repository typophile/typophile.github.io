  body: Triangular serifs and that wacko descending apex on the cap N. Loved this
    typeface, tried to use it on everything, but it worked on nothing.

  body: "Matrix is a great design, with one fatal flaw: that whacked \"g\", which
    is overly sevile to the grid, and totally jarring during [immersive] reading.
    If somebody would just fix that one thing, it could be such a useful font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yes, it's the artist, screaming out from the cage that is craft.\r\n\r\nI
    actually brought up Tarzana's \"Q\" on Typo-L ages ago. That actually got Licko
    to show up. But she didn't agree there was a problem. Damn shame, since Tarzana
    is one of my favorite fonts out there. Luckily, the \"Q\" is a very low-frequency
    letter. Matrix's \"g\" is like that crazy family member who shows up for every
    meal.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    -- do I get excommunicated for that? :-D\r\n\r\nMatrix is a train wreck though
    -- great concept, lousy result. I only liked it for a week or so when it came
    out."
