body: "Is there something like a print proofing before release of a typeface needed?
  I have  created a sans-serif for general use in short texts and wonder if printing
  it in a few places would help me in better adjusting the outlines (ink traps etc).\r\nI
  know that Mr Jos\xE9 Scaglione had a speech of such stuff at ATypI. Maybe it is
  not necessary and I am just too nervous?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Some type designers are tested with offset printing before release, especially
    if they\u2019re designed for low-quality printing. This is one reason that type
    designers make friends with designers who enjoy beta-testing new type."

  body: I don't know much about low-quality printing, but I'd say the same is true
    if you are going to use high-quality offset printing, between 2,400-3,600 dpi.
    This is especially important if there is any contrast in the letterforms. You
    are apt to find that fine lines are too fine. Probably less of an issue with a
    sans, but maybe not. For instance, new designers sometimes specify a .25-point
    rule, because it looks fine on the output of a laser printer. They are usually
    disappointed when the book comes out. It takes a .33-point rule to work with high-resolution
    offset printing, esp. on uncoated paper.

  body: "Laser prints can be a deceptive form of print proofing, as toner is very
    black and has a lot of \"gain\".\r\nChances are your typeface will look weaker
    when printed by offset than on your studio printer.\r\nNot such a problem for
    sans faces, but quite significant for serif designs.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is,
    offset is much sharper.\r\n"

    it, inkjet print it, maybe you know someone who likes to test typefaces on an
    offset job, etc. It's obviously good to know how your design works with a variety
    of printing methods."

  body: "Thank you! I didn't expect so many advices in such a short time!\r\n\r\nI
    guess my problem is just good checking how the type looks in reality, not while
    displayed. And, as I understand, the only \"non-deceptive\" solution is a high-quality
    offset print. (Because below there is a plenty of devices generating more and
    more odd effects like \"it's good to see you, but I won't depend on you\").\r\n"

    to put ink on paper. Another reality is that putting pixels on the screen is an
    equally important feature of \"type.\" Or even words on an old-fashion TV set,
    as with advertising.\r\n\r\nHigh-resolution offset printing is only one of these.
    What to test for -- and what weights & details of a font you decide to offer --
    depends on where you perceive a market for it's use."

  body: "Right. But since I discovered my home printers produce unrepetitable effects
    (once a stem is too thin, once - thick), I started to use them for checking glyph
    outlines in big magnifications only. I am sure I could \"dedicate\" the typeface
    for my printers, anyway ;)\r\n\r\nWill it be a mistake: to print the typeface
    on a variety of popular devices, to test the details, angles and weights; if any
    wrong effect appears frequently - check it; then try printing it on a silkscreen
    or offset to see how it behaves in better quality?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    shows up really weird on laserprint or high-quality inkjet, they will probably
    also be weird on offset -- even if that is much higher quality."
