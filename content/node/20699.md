  body: "The font in question is a custom typeface.\r\n\r\nThe front page of the Bronco's
    website has a PDF called \"The Power of Partnership.\" According to the document
    properties, the typeface shows up as \"BroncosPrimaryfin-regular.\" There's also
    a \"BroncosNumbers\" typeface as well.\r\n\r\nInsignia might be a decent, commercially
    available alternative."
