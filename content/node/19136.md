  body: "Conditional of  the kind of design you're interested in, but if you plan
    to do print work for the most part I'd give the following:\r\n\r\n1.\r\nThe 3
    P's \u2013 Prepress, prepress, production. If you want to make it as a designer
    you have to start somewhere and one of the best ways to show that you deserve
    those creative projects and are worth hiring is file handling. It's surprising
    how many recent grads do not know how to properly package a file for the printers
    or know the finer nuances of production work. Some may argue that there's great
    people that only do this their entire career, and it's true not every designer
    will be great and will find their niche doing one of these very important jobs.
    Knowing these skills well will at least get your foot in the door at a local print
    shop; up to a large studio or agency. It improves your speed on the computer,
    forces you into the habit of checking details and will help you immensely as you
    further your career.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nPaper first. It's the computer age and there
    is a strong urge to not to roughs/comps/ sketches on paper. It's a skill I find
    that gets over looked. Learning to draw is a great skill that everyone should
    try to work on.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nLearning isn't really a waste of time, sure you'll
    find things that are stupid or that you already knew, but overall there's nothing
    that comes to mind that was a 'complete waste of time'."

  body: "In addition to what has already been said:\r\n\r\nRound One:\r\nI like to
    see conscious decisions in a junior designer. I.E. designing with a concrete plan
    and having control over the decisions you make. The contrary to this would be
    doing things because you think they look pretty. After all, instinct (in regards
    to design atleast) is something learned. As Jan Tschichold said, \"Feelings have
    to mature into knowledge about the consequences of formal decisions.\"\r\n\r\nRound
    Two.\r\n\r\nGrids Grids Grids.\r\n(Well, that's me atleast).\r\n\r\nRound Three.\r\nThe

      Your feedback has been\r\nmost helpful. I am curious.\r\n\r\nIs it common for
      student of design\r\nto feel somewhat unsure of where\r\nhis place will be in
      this profession?\r\nWas there any point in your education \r\nyou felt you weren't

        here will probably be on the receiving end of the counsel. I wouldn't say
        it's uncommon at all for young designers to be unsure of their place in design.
        I'm only 23, and it's taken me this long to really figure out what the direction
        that I'd like to follow. Many of my peers, especially the more casual designers,
        are just out there looking for work. I would say the serious students\u2014the
        ambitious/motivated ones\u2014have an idea of where they'd like to be, but
        that comes in time."

  body: "> <em><strong>What\u2019s the most important skill you want in a junior designer?</strong></em>\r\n\r\nThis
    is a little tricky to respond to, but favor truthful advice to students than politically
    correct suggestions (BTW -- the replies above are sound and without compromise.)\r\n\r\nIn
    the business world, the job descriptions for \"Junior\" and \"Senior\" designer
    have little to do with the age or experience of a candidate and more to do about
    design skill sets/competency, organizational/supervisory abilities, production/schedule
    mindedness and \"professionalism\" of presentation (both in terms of how well
    you can present ideas to clients, and how you project yourself as an individual).\r\n\r\nI
    stronly suggest (for those seeking employment after graduation) that you personally
    drop descriptions of \"junior\" and \"senior\" and start describing yourselves
    as \"designer\". Also, drop any specialized descriptions such as \"graphic design\"
    \"corporate communications\" \"branding designer\" \"web designer\" when presenting
    or even thinking about yourselves, because in the business world the description
    \"pidgeon-holes\" you, making it difficult to take on projects beyond your self
    proclaimed title.\r\n\r\nNow this may seem to have strayed from your question,
    but when a person comes in to meet me saying they are a \"web designer\", I look
    for particular skill sets. If you come to me saying you are a \"junior designer\",
    another set of signals start flashing in my mind -- Do I want to take time to
    train you? How fast and how much can your learn related to specific tasks and
    responsibilities? How far can you go given the opportunity?\r\n\r\nMany, many
    people have remained \"junior designers\" for their entire profession. So what
    is the most important question I ask myself for a \"designer\" of any description?
    \r\n<em>Can this person passionately contribute to collaborative problem solving?</em>\r\n\r\n>
    <em><strong>What design skill did you learn that was the most useful?</strong></em>\r\nThe
    willingness to scrap everything and approach the problem from scratch.\r\n\r\n>
    <em><strong>What was a waste of time?</strong></em>\r\nAttempts at enhancing or
    justifying a design through verbal or written description."
