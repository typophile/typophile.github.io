  body: Your sample is somewhere halfway <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/optima/testdrive.html?s=GRAVITY&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Optima</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/lithos/light/testdrive.html?s=GRAVITY&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Lithos</a>. <BR>It somewhat reminds me of movie titles from the
    50s.

  body: Hello Yves.Thanks for your comments. I had looked at Lithos also. This is
    for a book cover and I mentioned to the publisher that it reminded me of the best
    of fifiies book design. Gravity is interesting, but as you said, it lacks the
    energy, and to my eye, the elegance of the hand cut one.
