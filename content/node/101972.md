  body: The artists listed suggest that this album was released in the 1950s or 1960s,
    which probably means that it was hand-lettered...

    body: 'Thanks. You might be right, but I have a feeling it was done more recently.
      The album was released recently by Starbucks (one of their own compilations),
      so the artwork is new. It may be the handwriting of the graphic designer who
      did it but it feels like a recent script, hand-lettered font. '
