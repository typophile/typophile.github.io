  about this.\r\n\r\nIt's from a new album put out by John Mayer and I love the design.
  I know that he mentioned at one time who the designer was that made it but I cannot
  find the text again...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I love the font, any help with what it is
  and where to find it?\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nJoshua"

    target=\"new\">Franklin Gothic Demi Compressed</a> was used, since in the sample

  body: "Can you explain to me what the difference would be in a \"display cut\"\r\n\r\nI
    have to apologize, I am new here and EXTREMELY inexperience when it comes to typography.
    I know with some of my professional fonts, there is often a \"display\" one, but
    I have never looked for the difference between the two.\r\n\r\nAlso, what is ink
    trap?\r\n\r\nAgain, I apologize for the probably simple questions."

  body: "Joshua, a display version of a font is meant to be used at large sizes, say
    huge on an album cover, so certain design details are tweaked.\r\n\r\nThe specific
    example in this font is the ink trap in the capital Y in \"TRY\". If you look
    at the sample posted by Norbert you'll see an extra notch in the \"valley\" of
    the Y, which is very obvious at huge sizes, but it helps to sharply define the
    \"valley\" at small sizes.\r\n\r\nThe Bell Centennial typeface was designed by
    Matthew Carter for Bell telephone books, and the ink traps help the clarity of
    the letters under the stresses of high-speed printing and their legibility at
    tiny sizes.\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/13687/bellcentennialboldlisting-font.html?PHPSESSID=d0565fba35fbaa2e61d211fa902a0dc0\r\n\r\nSome
    typefaces use the ink trap as a design device. A brilliant example of this is
    Christian Schwartz's \"Amplitude\".\r\nhttp://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude"
