body: "So I'm working on an identity for a ghost tour in Seattle. It's focus is the
  history around the Pike Place Market.\r\n\r\nI agree with the client that it's not
  quite there. She wants it a bit rougher in form as seen in early sketches with a
  bit of texture. The exploration file tries to add in a printed, texture look (just
  sketching over the original).\r\n\r\nThinking I need to take it further with more
  background elements. Like etching, dollar bill type, etc...\r\n\r\nI'm taking any
  critique anyone can offer. Thanks."
