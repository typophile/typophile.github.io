body: Unsure of what the truest Baskerville face is, I've only known of the various
  digital Baskervilles that I happen to come across in advertising and such. It seems
  that the common characteristics are wide set letters, high contrast (thicks strokes
  with almost hairline thin strokes). Knowing what I know about book type (that's
  not much!), doesn't that make it unfit for long passages of reading? If I never
  knew of the face before, and saw it for the first time, I would assume it was designed
  for display sizes, and that doesn't sound right.

    design \u2014 was it for books? \r\n\r\nDoes that unique Baskerville 10 for text
    sizes only exist because John Baskerville's design wasn't suited for text?"

  body: "Yes, Baskerville's design was for books. \r\n\r\nIn Baskerville's day, punches
    for metal type were cut at different sizes, and the designs of the letterforms
    were altered to make them suitable for those different sizes (lower contrast for
    smaller point-sizes, for example). \r\n\r\nBaskerville 10 as a digital font, thus,
    is not a <em>correction</em> to Baskerville's design, but rather somewhat of a
    <em>restoration</em> of the size-specific sensitivity that was standard in metal
    type and jettisoned in most digital type."

  body: "Something else to worry about:\r\nThere are two strains of Baskerville: the
    original and what's termed the \"Fry's\" style, which was a competitor's interpretation
    of the original. The Fry's tends to lean more heavily towards display usage, although
    some (like ATF) have made it in proper text sizes/cuts.\r\n\r\nAnd, FWIW my favorite
    is Fountain's:\r\nhttp://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/baskerville-1757\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Physics textbook (Halliday and Resnick) was set in Baskerville, and so I think
    it is a good text typeface.\r\n\r\nIt is a bit wide, just as Century Expanded
    is a bit condensed. But that just affects how one uses it - which size, what leading."
