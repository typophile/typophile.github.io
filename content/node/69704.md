  corners round (like those of ShinnType's [[http://shinntype.com/Figgins_Scotch.pdf|Figgins
  Sans]], for instance).\r\n\r\nThe obvious way would be to use FontLab's bold effect:
  first \"bold\" it by \u2013X%, then bold it by X% making round corners.\r\n\r\nTwo
  questions \u2013\r\n\r\nFirst, would you consider the result of such a procedure
  generally satisfactory? I'm getting the feeling that perfect contours become much
  less than perfect this way, requiring tedious cleanup, even for relatively small
  values of X. But maybe I care too much over tiny details that nobody cares about?
  What would you do?\r\n\r\nSecond, if I do it this way, then all resulting arcs have
  the same radius, regardless of the corner's angle. Is it not preferable that greater
  angles would be replaced by arcs with greater radii, so all would <em>look</em>
  softened by the same amount?"

    how I did that.\r\nIt wasn't a python script, though, just something in the basic
    FontLab menu.\r\nBut I can tell you there was a huge amount of clean-up involved.\r\nA
    lot of that was because of the \"resolution\" of 1000 units to the em.\r\nI would
    probably have been better to work at a much higher resolution.\r\n\r\nI'm not
    sure it is possible to avoid manually finessing the details.\r\nHere is the right
    terminal of \"s\" from Figgins, and from AG Rounded.\r\nIn both instances, the
    shapes do not correspond to a simple \"circularization\" of corners.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ShinnS_3418.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AG_5530.png]\r\n\r\nWhat
    is other people's experience with making rounded fonts?"

    method, so it''s VERY simple to specific round line caps and round corners. Corners
    usually don''t require any adjustments, but end caps generally do, but correcting
    the problem is as easy as deleting the center point and re-adding it...if that
    makes any sense. '

    to.\r\nMany TrueType fonts have an em square of 2048.\r\n\r\n<em>What did dictate
    its precise shape, then, if any? The eye alone?</em>\r\n\r\nYes, but I often paste
    circles into the mask layer, as in the image above, to use as a reference.\r\nWhen
    eyeballing the shape of curves, I use the \"vertical flip\" feature of the FontLab
    metrics window, which gives a different view; working in fonts that have a contrast
    of stress between vertical and horizontal, often at an angle, can play tricks
    on one's eyes, so flipping brings back a measure of objectivity. "

  body: Interesting, Nick. Perhaps it's because I'm novice, but the whole "do it by
    the eye" approach scares me a bit, and I always wish I found more systematic approaches.
