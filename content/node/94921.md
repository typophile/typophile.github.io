  as if handwritten by a woman a hundred and fifty years ago (or so - plenty of leeway)
  that can be smoothly read? I know there are lots of good period scripts out there
  (I rather like three island\u2019s emilyaustin for example), but of course unreadable
  strain for more than a few lines. What can I do? Use a plantin or somesuch and kiss
  off any suggestion of a letter effect? Or is there some weird hybrid period-piece
  script-serif (for indeed the \u2018letter effect\u2019 can be served by the vaguest
  of hints) I can use that you might know of? \r\n\r\nMany thanks for reading.\r\n\r\nDronbo"

    that any might be difficult to read today. Well, at least they HAD style.\r\n\r\nJust
    a few off the top of my head\r\n\r\n[[ http://www.p22.com/products/cezannepro.html|Cezanne]]\r\n
    \ Spencerian Scripts are nice but more formal\r\n Abbeyline (free)\r\n\r\nOr possibly
    one of the Staunton scripts:\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/sherwoodtype/stauntonscripts.html\r\n\r\n

  body: "One of the loveliest script/semiscripts I have come across is one called
    Grolier, which one may presume had to do with the Grolier Society, who published
    a great set of children's books in the early twentieth century, called <em>The
    Book of Knowledge</em>\u2014which it was. In fact, it was twelve books of knowledge,
    along with a lot of things to make and do\u2014which were in a surprising apt
    volume by themselves, entitled\u2026guess what?\r\n\r\nAnyhow, Grolier is one
    typeface I would dearly love to tackle, but complete enough specimens are VERY
    hard to come by. However, IF anyone else has seen the potential that I see in
    this typeface and has gotten to it before me\u2014no fair\u2014I would recommend
    it highly. The original also included some fancy caps, which made a good thing
    even better. If that is possible to do. Which it often is. But not always."

  body: "Thanks so far. I think readability is going to be a problem with any script
    though (Cezanne, for example, I have - lovely - but using it for more than a few
    lines is out of the question). Frode Frank\u2019s solution is ingenious and new
    (to me) - I think I\u2019ll try that (can\u2019t find Grolier alas)."
