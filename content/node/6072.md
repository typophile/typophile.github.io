  body: This is definitely a custom lettering job, although I don&#39;t know who did
    it. A-list magazines like <i>Fortune</i> simply don&#39;t use mere <i>fonts</i>
    for their logos. <BR> <BR>That said, there may be something similar available.

  body: It&#39;s a bit like Nick Shinn&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/medium/testdrive.html?s=FORTUNE&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Beaufort</a>, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/romana/testdrive.html?s=FORTUNE&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Romana</a> &#40;not counting the R&#41;, or even <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-golden-cockerel/golden-cockerel-itc-roman/testdrive.html?s=FORTUNE&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">ITC Golden Cockerel</a>, depending on how you look at it. But
    I don&#39;t know of anything that would come very close, weird though it seems.

  body: I would say as a general rule logos of large corporations and businesses will
    have custom logos. Think of it in Fortune there isn&#39;t one repeating character.
    Thats almost the first question I&#39;d have for someone looking for an ID. Are
    there repeating characters?

  body: 'Even then, that doesn&#39;t mean anything: while designing a logo,  <BR>you
    can easily copy a character if it&#39;s used more than once. The  <BR>proper question
    would be: Have you seen this supposed font  <BR>used in more than one instance,
    that is in multiple settings.'
