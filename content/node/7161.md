  body: It seems as if there are two separate identities going on here. The CMY blocks
    don&#39;t work for me &#40;they remind me too much of the BeOS generic app icon&#41;,
    but the treatments with the 3 are nice. <BR> <BR>I like 2 and 3 best &#40;without
    the blocks, that is&#41;.

  body: If you&#39;re going to use a &#39;fake&#39; cursive handwriting typeface,
    be sure to make all the connections actually connect between letterforms. <BR>
    <BR>However, I&#39;m not sure if handwriting really is indicative of printing,
    though. <BR> <BR>As for the blocks, they don&#39;t seem necessary. I&#39;d just
    drop them.

  body: 'The logos are looking much stronger. The second design from the bottom is
    by far the most resolved solution so far. The others still contain too many elements:
    the bars/circles, &#34;graphic&#34;, 3, the black box, and artes graficas. Even
    though the &#34;graphic 3&#34; is working as a unit, the contrast you offer between
    the letterforms and the number &#40;successfully in the latest versions with the
    red 3&#41; distinguishes these elements from each other. If you can&#39;t leave
    the illustrative element &#40;bars/circles&#41; behind, then i think you will
    need to pull the Graphic and 3 together in the same typeface to make it work.
    <BR> <BR>As it stands, the design without bars/circles has the two extremely characteristic
    moments of the A missing it&#39;s bar and the 3. They work well together playing
    angle off with curve, and pulling out the angles within the 3. My only suggestion
    here would be making the weight of the 3 a little heavier to push the contrast
    with the weight of the tall condensed letterforms. They might be just a bit too
    close in weight right now. <BR> <BR>Whever you move on from here, I think you
    need to pay more attention to the &#34;artes graficas&#34;.  It feels a little
    default.'

  body: What about the relationship of the number three with the actual symbol. For
    sure because it&#39;s artes graficas, we would have CMYK there... <BR> <BR>The
    second round is looking nice... but I think you lost the relationship between
    3 and the symbol, though there are beautiful marks and the interpretation of CMYK
    is really elegant. <BR> <BR>Visually i like the A without the crossbar, though
    I&#39;d think if that doesn&#39;t seem like a &#34;printing mistake&#34;. Not
    sure... <BR> <BR>But this direction is looking pretty good

  body: The treatment of &#34;graphic&#34; and &#34;3&#34; in the second and third
    logos &#40;of the most recent group&#41; are very pleasing. Again, I think the
    typography alone is elegant, and I would lose the lines and circles. Keep it simple.

  body: Gian if you must use a graphic representation of 4 color printing, take a
    photo thats printed and blow up a portion of it until you see only dots. See if
    you get something pleasing from that.  <BR> <BR>I personally prefer type logos
    only. I know what printers do and don&#39;t have time for gimics. I want my print
    jobs clean, crisp, professional and on time. Also the printing industry is now
    more than just process printing so they might not want to piegon-holed by such
    a restrictive mark.

  body: Thanks for your suggestions and explanations. I&#39;ve turned into a cleaner
    treatment, playing only with typo. I like futura on second and third, but, as
    explains daniel, I think the tall letters give a more clean, direct and professional
    impress. <BR> <BR>cmyk representation will be used for cards and papers work.

  body: '&#34;artes graficas&#34; is invisible. Is it significant to this business&#39;
    title? If so, then it needs to have more substance. It might be as simple as increasing
    the type weight and/or size. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: artes graficas means graphic art, printing... I didn&#39;t want to give it
    many significance in the draw, just to clear up what kind of company is about.
    I can even get rid of it, and try to replace it with a simple visual that would
    say the same thing and even reach the mind quicker.

  body: I&#39;m not sure about the letterspacing, but the simple square bullet is
    working for me.  <BR> <BR>If you must include CMYK references, perhaps just use
    that as an additional part of the business system, but not explicitly part of
    the logo lock-up. &#40;that said, I don&#39;t think the CMYK reference is necessary.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Nice job.
