  blocks for a scene, and I'm not sure as to what font to use for the \"letters\".\r\n\r\nHere
  is an image of the letter blocks I'm referrencing:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/images/300/letter_blocks.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas what font that might be - or a font that would be a close simile?\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much for your help\r\n\r\nDodge"

  body: One of those blocks (the one with the C) is ITC American Typewriter. Clarendon
    and similar fonts would be fairly archetypal.
