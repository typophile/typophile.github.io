  kerning?\r\n\r\nI know that metrics are instructions built into a face that gives
  software programs instructions about how much space to put between different combinations
  of glyphs.  Arent these 'metrics' set-up so that faces have correct optical spacing
  depending on the shape of each glyph?  If so, the what is 'optical' kerning.\r\n\r\nSpecifically,
  i'm talking about type controls in Adobe CS programs.\r\n\r\nThanks - JonnySchneider"

  body: "I'm not sure of the difference. While optical kerning may perhaps be a handy
    tool for large bodies of text, for display type (and wherever possible) one should
    always manually kern.\r\nI guess metric kerning would be based on the kerning
    info from the font file, where as optical is an approximation/adjustment based
    on the visual character. Still never going to be as good as adjusting by eye.\r\n<br

    for anything other than display sizes (usally do it by eye anywway). An exception
    would be made with badly spaced fonts which can look better in text settings with
    the Adobe's optical kerning.\r\n\r\nAlso may be of interest; \r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/20455\">Opinions

    There's my answers)</cite>  \r\n\r\nThanks guys, but i dont think anyones actually
    answered the question...\r\n\r\nI know there is no substitute for kerning by eye.\r\nMetric
    kerning uses the kerning info stored in the font file, but what info does the
    'optical' setting in Adobe kerning use to make its adjustments.\r\n\r\nI guess
    i should RTFM...\r\n\r\nok, i did.\r\n\r\n'optical' kerning in CS is used <i>To
    automatically adjust the spacing between selected characters based on their shapes</i>.\r\n\r\nHm,
    see, isn't that what typographer's do when they write metrics for their typefaces?\r\n\r\nSounds
    like 'optical' kerning is an approximation for faces with crappy kerning info.
