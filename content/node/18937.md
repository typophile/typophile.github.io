  Script, Serif and Slab Serif.\r\nThis one is a fairly narrow font with a hint of
  calligraphic forms attached for a bit of character. I have finished the Roman and
  Italics ranges, and currently working with the Small Caps, OSF, and some OT features\u2026\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SuomiSans.png]"

  body: "Nice work.\r\nTwo pence from me though:\r\n\r\nIn my opinion (and going by
    what i can make out of the image supplied), for the sake of consistency, it would
    be worth a try to have that calligraphic, \"broken\" stroke also on lc u, n, m,
    etc, in the same vein as it is featured in s and o.\r\n\r\nthe second thing is
    that your weights appear smaller with increasing weight (which is a known phenomenon),
    for my liking you should increase your x-height a bit with each weight compared
    to the respective lighter one, to compensate for that effect (I assume that all
    your weights share an identical x-height?).\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Thank you very much for the insights.\r\n\r\nAnd sorry about the limited
      sample; I seem to have some problems uploading attachemts\u2026\r\n\r\nIn fact
      I have a logic (of sorts) to the \"broken\" strokes: they are on the upper left,
      and lower right, to follow the nib of a pen. th lc u, n etc. are cut before
      the intake.\r\n\r\nOn the second thing you are right; I haven't incerased the
      x-height. I should do that to compensate the mass of the glyphs. Thanks."
