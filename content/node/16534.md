    Always thought that would make a great teaching aid.

    guess I didn't shoot down the bad kerning pairs fast enough (YOU LOSE!) ;-(\r\n\r\nA
    few of us have brought the topic of educational games in previous threads. Here's
    the one on <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14515\" target=\"new\">If Typography
    was (were) a video game</a>.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear more of your thoughts
    concerning what students may be able to pick up with a game that they don't seem
    to be getting in class. Maybe \"game\" isn't really the proper term... interactive
    tools for learning is longer but more accurate."

  body: "Hi Norbert,\r\n\r\nInteresting that the \"If Typography was a video game\"
    discuss appeared two days after my thesis defense. I should have started that
    discussion back in January.\r\n\r\nThe topic of whether education games can really
    be effective in teaching typography is untested and why I developed these. After
    developing these, I am interested in whether anyone has used or is willing to
    use www.typehype.net in the classroom. I want to measure the level of success.
    I feel that for game-based learning to be truely effective, each game must have
    clearly defined learning objective(s).  \r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\n<strong>Problem
    Statement</strong>\r\nCollege undergraduate communication design students are
    producing deficient typography. These deficiencies are specifically related to
    the rapid identification of typeface design and inplemenation of kerning and proper
    typographic punctuation. \r\n\r\n<strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong>\r\nSince
    the computer has been integrated into design education, there has been more of
    an emphasis on software competency than that of letterform structure and typographical
    nuances. The design industry has pressured educators to mold students who are
    technically adept by raising the entry-level job requirements. In addition, typography
    was taught mainly through lecture and hand skills however this methodology does
    not attract current design students due to the expanse of technology in existence
    today.\r\n\r\n<strong>Needs Analysis</strong>\r\nDue to college undergraduate
    communication design student\u2019s technological capabilities and its saturation
    upon their social lives, design education would benefit by incorporating an alternative
    teaching methodology that appeals to the student\u2019s learning and life styles.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\nMy
    intention of applying game-base learning was sparked by analyzing the habits of
    the 18-22 design student population. These individuals are \"plugged in\" 24/7.
    The games are to increase their knowledge on a more subminal level. Each style
    of game was chosen due to its addictive quality...come on who doesn't love a little
    Tetris or Bejeweled. All of the rewards in my games are used to help the user
    play the games better by reiterating guidelines of \"good\" typography. \r\n\r\nI
    would love it if my students (...or anyone else's) would take a break from their
    design projects and play a little \"Serif\" or \"Faceoff\" to take their mind
    off things. I hate to say it but...edutainment may be part of the future.\r\n\r\n"

    etc., except that the Typographic Education topic area is not as visited as most
    other areas.\r\n\r\nHopefully we can change that, with individuals like yourself,
    that contribute and want to improve tools and methods of type/typographic education
    and training.\r\n\r\nIt's still early in the planning stages for the next TypeCon
    in 2006, but we hope to develop a viable program for Type Education."

  body: "I love edutainment - it's just had to pull off well, to strike the needed
    balance between gaminess and learning. But I think you're doing pretty good, overall.
    Some comments:\r\n\r\nFace Off: Too slow-paced. Put a count-down. Or maybe even
    a way for the grid to \"regrow\", increasingly quickly, so you could actually
    lose (if it fills up again). Which means you might have to start with the top
    row empty. BTW, the little \"Font Library\" sidebar thing is cool.\r\n\r\nSerif:
    Fine, except it's hard to judge good/bad kerning at such lo-res. You might turn
    it into a (quickly-changing) sequence of larger settings instead?\r\n\r\nType
    Invaders: Looks cool! And those daggers are great. The thing is though, although
    the instructions contain great education, the game itself is just Space Invaders;
    it would be much better to put \"educational decisions\" in the actual game as
    well. Lastly, a small thing: that pixelfont is too blurry.\r\n\r\nAnother thing:
    it's taking too long just to bring up the \"Loading...\" messages.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I hope I don't seem to negative, because\r\nI think you're doing a really good
    thing here.\r\nSo please make more!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I once designed a version of [[http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Original-Memory/dp/B00000IWDD|Memory]],
    only instead of pictures, I used letter a's from different fonts. That went over
    pretty well, but then again, we were all freaks. I can't wait 'till I have kids.
