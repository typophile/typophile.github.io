  this is a hand drawing, but maybe someone out there knows something! This vintage
  hand drawn RCA logo is the inspiration for our album cover.  if anyone knows a similar
  font i can use to get close, I'll add the lightning bolt with our graphic artist.
  \ our name is \r\n\" ristband \" so the \"R\" and \"A\" need to be pretty exact.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/images[8]_3585.jpg]\r\n\r\nhere
