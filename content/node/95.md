    somehow on the mind of a child &#40;or something like that&#41;. And the fact
    that ISOTYPE means International System of Typographic Picture Education leads
    me to believe that it was supposed to cross linguistic and cultural boundaries. '

  body: Ok, that&#39;s enough messing around. <BR> <BR>These graphics were originally
    created for the &#39;Viennese Museum for Society and Economy&#39;, which bagan
    life in 1924. Neurath wanted to make complex social and economic information comprehensible
    for the man and woman in the street with no prior knowledge of that sort of thing.
    So him and his missus and Mr. Anrtz worked their respective backsides off for
    years and years and years so that they could fill a room with little pictures
    of men and women in Reading. <BR> <BR>How&#39;s that?

    That was just an awful guess. <BR> <BR>Anyway, give us a hint, Matha. It that
    a anglo-saxon language?

  body: <i>That was just an awful guess</i> <BR> <BR>Or maybe you just don&#39;t play
    Scrabble very much. Apparently the Portuguese version isn&#39;t very popular.
    <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve already guessed English so &#39;Anglo-saxon&#39; is out the
    window. I don&#39;t know how I can give you a hint without giving the game away
    &#40;literally&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll say this. Scrabble letters are genarally
    Uppercase. This means that for some languages &#40;not in German or Czech as you
    can see&#41;, accents are omitted.  <BR> <BR>Matha.

    that. At least in Brazil, it&#39;s not popular at all. <BR>I don&#39;t even know
    this game is/was commercialised here. <BR> <BR>Is it a national language? Or some

    be a national language. <BR> <BR>So, Matha, give us any hint. Geographical, cultural,
    anything. I can&#39;t remember of any language that uses diacritics only in lowercase.
