  Except that for some reason my apply button isn\u2019t available in this font today?
  What did I do that\u2019s keeping me from changing glyph properties and how do I
  fix it?"

  body: It may make sense to think about which glyph set you would like to offer,
    and then create your own .enc file, or derive one from existing ones. It is just
    a list of glyph names, so easy to write or modify in a text editor. It also helps
    you quickly bringing your glyphs into a desired standard order by selecting your
    encoding and then "sort glyphs". (<a href="http://www.kltf.de/kltf_notes_concept1.htm"
