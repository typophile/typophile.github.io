body: "It's probably the arc that's giving me trouble with this one , but does anybody
  recognize the font used in the title? It's a simple cover with only a few fonts
  , all of which I thought I had tracked down. \r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe Egyptienne
  , since right below the title that font is used as a tag. No luck though , regardless
  of how I scale/alter the text. \r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/egyptienne-2/\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas on what the title could be? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lotr_title_3867.jpg]"

  body: "I actually have that font , although not from bitstream. The problem is ,
    I can recreate the arch just fine using Illustrator , but the Clarendon font doesn't
    seem to line-up properly. \r\n\r\nThe slabs are a little different , and the most
    notable issues are with the letters L,R & G. \r\n\r\nAre there any others you
    could possibly recommend , if you please? I know we're in the right style or family
    of font , I'm just not able to pinpoint it. :(\r\n\r\nThanks! "

  body: "Like I said, it was hand corrected so you will never find one to match perfectly.
    \ Convert the closest version to outlines and hand correct the nodes in AI.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS:
    Also, the orginal is not very well done so I think you could actually do better
    on your own.  Look at the \"O\" and see how flat is? It does not fit the arc.
    There are other lumpy areas that make me think it was hand drawn and not a typeface
    arched in AI."
