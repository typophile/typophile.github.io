body: "Dear All,\r\n\r\nLiving in Japan I often see these two logotypes and I am curious
  as to what fonts are used.\r\n\r\nThe first sample is from Takashimaya, our department
  store of choice here in Osaka and is the main logotype used in their branding and
  packaging. Takashimaya use a wide range of other fonts in their website and printed
  materials, although in my opinion none of them have the warmth and character of
  the one here. Sorry about the poor sample - it's a photo of a sticker on a bag of
  rye bread! Please take a look at www.takashimaya.co.jp for another sample (although
  this font is not used widely there). It has similar qualities to FF Roice but very
  different letterforms.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Takashimaya Sample_5115.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  second sample if from au by kddi which is a mobile phone carrier here (www.au.kddi.com/index.html).
  The 'au' is the main logotype and is commonly used as white characters on an orange
  background. I see this logotype very very often and it always bugs me as to what
  the font is. It looks like one of the heavier weights of Lucas de Groot's 'The Sans'
  family - a sort of straigtened up version of the italic 'a'.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/au
  sample_5181.jpg]\r\n\r\nI look forward to you putting my curiousity at ease!\r\n\r\nGrant

  body: "Pattyfab,\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion. It is close to Pendraw, but there
    are quitea few differences. Same for Memphis.\r\n\r\nI suspect that it is a custom
    font.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGrant"
