		<div class="commentbody">You did that in two days?! Wow. Very polished already. <BR> <BR>It sort of looks familiar (although I'm not saying you swiped anything) - I guess it reminds me of Caecilia, although it's less humanist (which I think is working great). <BR> <BR>The &quot;g&quot; is really nice! I do see a bit too much humanism in it though (compared to the rest), so maybe make the joins (especially between the head and bottom) more rigid. <BR> <BR>For the &quot;t&quot;, try making the curve two straight segments instead. And maybe cut the finial like the &quot;e&quot;. <BR> <BR>The &quot;s&quot; seems to be leaning a hair forward. <BR> <BR>&gt; I have found a (subtle) slab very fulfilling to make, don't quite know why. <BR> <BR>Probably because you feel surrounded by hipocrisy, and straight lines &amp; abrupt shifts are more &quot;honest&quot; - if also less interesting. Wedge serifs can be a great compromise. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the Feedback. Amazing, I have been looking  <BR>closely at Oranda and PMN Caecilia, as well as Officina  <BR>and Silica. (Is it that obvious?)

		<div class="commentbody">HI Kris. <BR> <BR>Nicely done. I've got a slab in the cooker too. I like what you  <BR>have started! <BR> <BR>Here are some thoughts: <BR>The width seems inconsistent to me. The glyph that first drew  <BR>my attention was the n. Looks wide. Then maybe the m a little  <BR>too. Maybe the u a hair, b mabe a little narrow. Ok, enough of that! <BR> <BR>The bracketing in the top of the t is out of character. <BR> <BR>Keep an eye on your serifs. Many of them look equal on left and  <BR>right. This is sometimes best, but often not. Consider your n.  <BR>Part the width issue is that the inward halfs of the serifs equal  <BR>the outer halfs. You can shave the insiders down, maintaing the  <BR>white space and while allowing you to narrow the glyph. Also  <BR>check your v. It's like the n in reverse. The inner halfs can afford  <BR>to be longer, but the outer halfs need to be as short as you can  <BR>manage. Otherwise the spacing will be a nightmare. Some of this  <BR>will become more evident as you begin spacing. <BR> <BR>Old Style Figures: <BR>Do they have serifs? Where? <BR>Does a four sit on the baseline? <BR>Does a four descend to the depth of a five? How close? <BR>Do the top of the five and seven line up? <BR>Is a nine a rotated six? <BR> <BR>These are all questions to ask. I think the answers are: it  <BR>depends. OSF are a weird animal. Look at a wide gamut of OSF.  <BR>Attached are 6/9 comparisons for a handfull of fonts. In Caecilia  <BR>the 6 is exactly a rotated 9. In other cases, the only adjustment  <BR>is for ascender descender height (Sauna). Sometimes it is vastly  <BR>different. It seems the more upright the stance, the less  <BR>adjusting is needed. All of that said, I think yours look pretty  <BR>good. (Maybe snip back the tail on the nine and round out the  <BR>tail curve a bit more.) <BR> <BR>More please! <BR> <BR>Randy <BR><!--attachment: 6v9-34295.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*189.1**6v9%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf"><br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6v9-34295.pdf" target="_blank"><b>6v9.pdf</b></a> (189.1 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">My personal taste is in having the lowercase (oldstyle) numerals as first choice. Even if you choose an hybrid my observations still hold value: you need to reduce the height of the numerals, and adjust the zero width, I think. I don't recall which but there are good text faces with &quot;hybrid&quot; numerals. <BR> <BR>Weiss' numerals, for example, are pretty lower in height (although I don't like Weiss too much, except the Italic), but I don't recall other examples right now.</div>
