  body: "This is the sort of font that could be made easily and cheaply, so it's possible
    it is a custom font. I could not find an identical match, but several were fairly
    similar. See [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=4342361&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=10266&query=KIDPRINT&SCOPE=Fonts|Kidprint]]
