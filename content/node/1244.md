  around 3 days to get this far but I&#39;m thinking of doing the whole font. <BR><img

    <BR> <BR>A few comments: <BR>- The V&#39;s and Q&#39;s bother me. I don&#39;t
    have any suggestion for the V&#39;s, I hate drawing that letter myself. <BR> <BR>-
    Consider adding a curve to the stem of the 7. <BR> <BR>- Consider lengthening
    the bar of the E &#40;but not the F&#41;. <BR> <BR>- Something about the at-sign
    doesn&#39;t seem right. <BR> <BR>- The pound and percent signs are really wide!

  body: Thats great Paul, <BR>Just the sort of info I need. I&#39;ll give it a go
    in the next few days. And thanks Hrant for the positive comments. I like the idea
    of a little neville brody influence creeping in there some where. D.

  body: 'Hi David, <BR> <BR>it also reminds me in a good way to House Gothic, a very
    nice type. <BR>I totally agree with Paul. I have some personal things to add too:
    <BR>- Try thickening the diagonal in the UC &#39;S&#39; <BR>- The &#39;&#43;&#39;
    and &#39;#&#39; signs are a little heavy <BR>- The &#39;z&#39;s bother me a little.
    It&#39;s the round foot. <BR>- Try making the bars on the &#39;$&#39; thicker.
    I think they are to thin. <BR>- Although I like it, the &#42; doesn&#39;t seem
    to fit. Hmm... maybe it&#39;s me. <BR>- Try moving the diagonal in the &#39;?&#39;
    down. Perhaps that opens it up a little more. <BR>- Shouldn&#39;t the downscore
    be a little more down? <BR> <BR>But nevertheless it&#39;s a very nice type. I
    see good potential for it. Good work in only three days. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like
    to use it. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren'

    before in a German design school. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Cheers for all the helpful info, I&#39;m going to adjust the inards of the
    initial post to keep it more inkeeping with the lighter weight version. I will
    release the square version to. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16227.gif"

  body: Here&#39;s the line up for the light version. Loads of work but I will post
    a pdf when I&#39;m closer to the truth with both weights and a more completed
    set. Any more comments would be very much needed. Cheers, Dave.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16230.gif"

  body: 'Hi David, <BR> <BR>Some things that catch my eye: <BR>- the lc &#39;k&#39;
    should be wider <BR>- the &#39;v&#39; and &#39;w&#39; are not my favorite. I think
    the UC &#39;W&#39; is wide or has at least to much white in it <BR>- try changing
    the curve in the &#39;2&#39; and &#39;z&#39;. It&#39;s strange and destroys the
    balance <BR>- move the bar of the lc &#39;f&#39; a little up. That&#39;s no problem
    <BR>the belly of the UC&#39;Y&#39; could go a little bit down. It feels now not
    heavy enough at the bottom. <BR>- the &#39;o&#39; in the %-sign could be a little
    less wide if you ask me. <BR> <BR>These are just the things that personally bothered
    me. It&#39;s up to you as the designer how you want your type to look. I think
    making the changes would make the type more homogenious. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren'

  body: wow. the lighter version is absolutely beautiful. Actually looks alot like
    the font that I designed for a typography class I took.  <BR> <BR>I see one problem
    with the light version. The Z is somewhat inconsistent the top is hard edged and
    there&#39;s a curve on the bottom. I think the curve would work on both sides.
    <BR> <BR>Excellent work
