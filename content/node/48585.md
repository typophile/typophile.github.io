  body: Nice, Mike. I've been looking for something with that rounded right leg on
    the 'h'. Seems like I've seen a font simmilar, including that 'h', before, but
    I cannot find it now.

    has been digitized.

  body: The font dates back to 1915 and is credited to Joseph E. Hill and Edward E.
    Bartlett. There was also a bolder weight and full character sets can be seen in
    Mac McGrew's "American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century".

    the time spent on this ID and the image posting. I really like the typefaces.
    I suppose the Linotype heritage precludes digitization by non-Linotype folk like,
    well, yourself, eh?"

  body: 'I''m not that crazy about it. It may very well be faithful to the Plato de
    Benedictus source material, but it has a lot of design problems. The narrow lowercase
    "e" and the weird "h" keep jumping out at me. I think it''s telling that it faded
    into obscurity. '
