body: "I need an ID on the sans serif face being uses in the current issues of Q Magazine.
  It seems to be part of a large family going by the amount of weights on show; it
  may also be the same family as the serif face used in the magazine as apostrophes
  are quite similar. There is a possibility too that this is custom drawn face but
  I have found no reference to it in web searches or on any of the major foundry's
  websites. I have attached samples below.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated,\r\n\r\nNaoise

    family]] by [[http://www.garagefonts.com/|Garage Fonts]], if I'm not mistaken.
