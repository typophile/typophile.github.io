  body: "This, my friend, is a monospaced font from some extremely high speed laser
    or ion deposition printer, the kind used to print credit card bills and other
    mailed items for which the paper buyer works in units of tons.\r\n\r\nYou're probably
    not going to be able to find the font on the open market, because it probably
    only exists as a bitmap at the resolution of the printer in question, and was
    probably designed by an engineer rather than a real font designer."
