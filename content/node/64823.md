  here to ask if you guys know any specialty offset printer in Portland that is able
  to print posters on archival quality paper?\r\n\r\nSo far I have:\r\nhttp://www.pinballpublishing.com\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stumptownprinters.com\r\n\r\nHowever,
  these two shops offer 1-color offset printing. I'm looking into something like 4
  to 6 color offset printing for a limited edition poster I have in mind (500 copies).\r\n\r\nI
  would love to have a local printer here so that I can go there and get my hands
  on production as well as giving them insight on my specific needs.\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much!\r\n\r\nOh, and I would love to get together with fellow typophiles
  in order to get to know a little more the city and the people."

    to detail. I have a run of 3-color posters coming off the press this week. I can't
    recommend them enough. Just stop by, call or email and they'll give you the lowdown
    on what they can do for you.\r\n\r\n"
