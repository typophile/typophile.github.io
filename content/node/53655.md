  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cultivation-of-Artists_6470.jpg]\r\n\r\nTHE
  CULTIVATION OF ARTISTS IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY AMERICA edited by Georgia B Barnhill.
  \ \r\n\r\nIt explains how trade schools trained anyone who could draw with skills
  to job the burgeoning industries that hallmarked the era about which it is written.\r\n\r\nArtists
  where taught to cut images onto copper plates and lithography stones to illustrate
  the newspapers, periodicals and publishing house flourishing in that time.  Think
  about it, who drew all those lovely cross-hatched scenes, portraits and products
  before photography was used in print?  Commercial artists.  And how did they get
  trained?  Through the apprentice system, until it was compromised by bigger and
  bigger industry.\r\n\r\nSo, you think you\u2019re so special?  Read this book."

  body: "Dear Sharon,\r\n\r\nI didn't know this about de Kooning's beginnings but
    just \"googled\" him. Wow! \r\n\r\nOne of the many interesting points in this
    book is that it posits the thought that commercial training informs and inspires
    (or gives confidence and the tools) to commercial artists to become fine artists.\r\n\r\nMany
    young people from Europe emigrated to the U.S. to avoid and or as a result of
    the horrors between WWI and II and made their living in the commercial art field:\r\n\r\nBen
    Shawn, Horst P.Horst, Van Dongen, Man Ray and Hoyningen-Hueneto name but a few.
    \ America was the safe have to which so many of the world's oppressed came.  There
    was work here and a future.\r\n\r\nI have a stack of old fashion magazines from
    the mid-30s and the names of now famous visual artists, art directors and writers
    got their start in the industrial arts.  Think of Alexey Brodovich, for example."
