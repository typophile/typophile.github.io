  the Oxford Canadian Spelling. :) \r\n\r\nAll my hyphenation needs in a book *way*
  more compact than the hardcover COD I had been using. Can't believe I didn't know
  this existed until now.\r\n\r\nKristina"

  body: "Never trust someone who only knows one way to spell a word -- Mark Twain.\r\nI
    have often ended up mixing spellings of words like color in the same article,
    but the editor's job is consistency. Now suppose I deliberately vary spelling,
    will readers think it's intentional or a mistake? I suppose it depends on the
    overall style of the writing, James Joyce must of bin a beatch to edit. "

  body: "hehe, Nick that's why I studied \"creative writing\" - so I could say those
    were intentional mis-spellings. But as an editor, I guess that excuse wouldn't
    fly. *sigh*\r\n\r\nThanks Linda, for the suggestion. \r\n\r\nNevermind Joyce!
    You should try some of the stuff coming out of our more scientific departments.
    ouch.\r\n\r\nK."
