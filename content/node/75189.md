  is a chance it's vector clip art. When I got it, it was set inside circles to look
  like antique typewriter keys. I'm just including the letterforms.\r\n\r\nI attached
  a screen grab showing the control points in case that helps.\r\n\r\nThanks much!
  I really appreciate the help!\r\n\r\nBarry\r\n\r\n"
