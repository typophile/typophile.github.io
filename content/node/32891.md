body: "OK, so I'm setting myself up for a fall but here goes.\r\n\r\nI'm busy creating
  my CV in order to get some freelance work. I want to use it to get other design
  agencies to use me for the specialist information design work I do, and help them
  understand the value in getting me involved rather than trying to blunder through
  it themselves.\r\n\r\nSo far I have reached what is contained in this PDF. \r\n\r\nI
  have a few concerns about it, but I figure by getting some other feedback, I could
  see if they're founded. I would like any comments anyone has, particularly around
  whether the message of it is clear.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\n\r\nRobert"

  body: "I'm not entirely sure this fits my idea of a cv. I have always tried to keep
    the number of pages down to one or two. \r\n\r\nIt is written clearly and I like
    that you list the reasons, and I like the personal no bull**** tone, but I'm not
    convinced they need to be so big. Would it not be possible to do something similar
    but reduce the number of pages? Somehow I get the impression that by taking up
    so much space to say so little you are using smoke and mirrors. But that's me.
    \r\n\r\nYou are missing a period on page 4. The orange subheads on page 3 are
    not consistent in the way the others are. Page 4 has more impact.\r\n\r\nI also
    would think you don't need the cover page, and your contact info should be a little
    more prominent and closer to the beginning.\r\n\r\n(my two cents!)\r\nK."

  body: I agree totally with Kristina. Keep it to one or two pages. Page 2 in particular
    says nothing. I'm not sure as an art director I'd even get past that page. It's
    always been a personal pet peeve of mine when a designer - or anybody - feels
    the need to overexplain themselves. Show, don't tell. You spend a lot of pages
    telling us we should hire you because you're different and then we get to the
    actual c.v. (page 6!) and see nothing different at all. If the point is that  you
    communicate information more clearly than anybody else, this resume really doesn't
    convey that, it feels like a lot of hot air.

    paper sizes. I would suggest staying within a more common print size, especially
    if you're not sending out physical copies yourself.\r\n\r\nI would say this CV
    is anything but simplistic."

  body: "Thanks for the comments so far.\r\n\r\nI have intentionally moved away from
    the more normal CV route (I have one of those as well \u2013 it looks like most
    of the others!) to make this more of a piece of personal marketing. The PDF stuff
    will be accompanied by case studies of my work which will meet the \"show don't
    tell\" point, and also (in my opinion) negate all the usual qualifications garbage.\r\n\r\nIn
    my experience, when I explain what I do to other designers, they don't tend to
    see beyond it being \"a few forms and stuff\" so I do feel the need to explain
    that the work I do is far more complex \u2013 perhaps I shouldn't be so paranoid
    and credit people with a little more intelligence.\r\n\r\nNo it's not a common
    size, but I'm printing, binding and mailing them myself so that's not really an
    issue.\r\n\r\nKeep the comments coming, and thanks again."

  body: The problem - both here and on your web site (which is nicely designed btw)
    - is it's a lot of words describing what you do and no visual examples. This is
    why people are confused. You're trying to present yourself as someone who communicates
    clearly and I feel like I'm getting spin and no substance.

    lack of graphic is hurting you. I was very impressed by the work on your personal
    website but that took some hunting to find. You taked a lot about what you do,
    but don't show it.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree it needs to be shorter, or at least the
    first page should get to the point quickly and entice you into reading more."

    It is however perfectly acceptable to use them to promote myself \u2013 it's a
    fine line I know!\r\n\r\nThis is part of the reason I'm looking to freelance,
    to have some work I can put my own name to and use to promote myself as a stand
    alone business in time.\r\n\r\nThe full cv can now be found at http://www.flowersandchocolate.co.uk/cv_full_to_proof.pdf

    could be done away with completely \u2013 it is the last page I put in after all. "

    pages properly. It just seems to encapsulate everything that's wrong with Britain
    today: - Blah, blah, blah, all talk and obfuscation. You could try working for
    New Labour. \r\n\r\nAs people don't have much time to plough through CV's it's
    quite annoying to read a load of bull, looking for CV information, and then get
    to the last page to find there isn't much anyway. Prospective employers may feel
    cheated somehow, and dismiss you before even giving you a chance.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    dismiss 'all the usual qualifications garbage', as this is what people are looking
    for in a CV.\r\n\r\nBTW, I don't mind the format; it's unusual, but keep the info

    than thrilled about your substitution of en-dashes with word spaces on either
    side for properly set em-dashes with thin spaces.\r\n\r\nThat's a bit of traditionalist
    nit-picking, however, I do think you could make the presentation a bit shorter,
    which would improve it as a sales tool."

  body: Perhaps it will have a different impact as a printed and bound piece, but
    as a 25 page PDF - I (an art director who hires freelance designers) loose interest
    by page 4. It may be cultural, CVs are kept quite short here in the States, one
    or two pages. Mine is 2 pages and sometimes I feel that is too long so I also
    designed a more succinct version. Since your specialty is organizing information
    in meaningful ways, why don't you design your CV including 'all the usual qualifications
    garbage' with the same kind of dedication and professionalism as you have with
    your paying clients. Your current PDF  reminds me of an episode of the old Bob
    Newhart show, one of the characters writes a book, but he only types one word
    on each page. He's excited to receive feedback from the publisher because the
    envelope is so thick. Until he discovers that they too only typed one word on
    each page, and he has received a 10 page rejection form.

  body: The latest version I've uploaded was very untidy. It was there to demonstrate
    the fact that there were word examples included in the CV as well as the text
    I'd put up in the first version. That said you have just made me go back and check
    that line break. That's the plus side of printing things myself, never too late
    to spot an error!

  body: "I think that while many of the point given to you in the thread are not wrong
    they have been given with a bit more of an aggressive tone that I would have.
    \r\n\r\nHere is my take: \r\n\r\nThe pdf CV is wordy in a way that undermines
    your case. You are selling concision so arguably you should demonstrate it in
    the CV. \r\n\r\nThe description you give of what you do is better on the web site
    - and sounds more confident. I got the feeling you were in a defensive position
    as you wrote the CV and that you were being falsely mately or casual to compensate.
    Watch the tone you use and if needed find a writer even if you do that same work.
    Writing for yourself is an especially tough thing to do.\r\n\r\nThere is alot
    of clever wordplay in advertising and I see you mimiking that. But you're not
    in Advertising. Is Ad copy one of the skills you are selling? My impression is
    - no.\r\n\r\nSo I think it might be better to simply state the value of bringing
    you onto a project. Step into their shoes and thing of reasons they would benefit.\r\n\r\nPehaps
    you could say \"As a dedicated specialist I free the creative team to go after
    far larger projects/clients by taking care of the ID aspect of the project. Bringing
    a specialist ID onto the team means higher quality ID which means superior client
    satifaction/retention - particularly for larger clients. And repeat business is
    always healthy for the bottom line.\" \r\n\r\nOr some such similar thing. \r\n\r\nNo
    doubt an few examples of the kind of things ID is good for would be good as well
    - obviously not everybody gets what ID is.\r\n\r\nDo you see what I mean?  "

  body: "I agree with Eben, you're undermining your pitch. You start with the premise
    that you promise Simplicity and then you bombard us with extra words. Each of
    your examples should fit on a spread, there's no need for a title page for each
    one. Imagine the name of the project on the left followed by your Before and After
    facing the examples.\r\n\r\nI really don't like the various samples at skewed
    angles, it looks messy and hard to follow what you've done. Again, simplicity."
