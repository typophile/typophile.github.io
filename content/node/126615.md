    sample?

  body: "Many thanks, Jay.  Looking at that specimen book, it appears that this Oxford
    1940 is an exact match for Twelve Point Caslon Old Face. Indeed, it is page 16,
    but I first looked at absolute page 16, which obviously doesn't match. Then started
    studying others at high zoom and came to the conclusion above. Then zoomed out
    and, boom, page 16!.\r\n\r\nNote the major differences between 'C' at 12pt (no
    lower serif) vs 18pt and above.  Also the length of the base of the 'E' at 12pt
    (longer relative width) vs 14pt and above. \r\n\r\nSo unless some other discovery
    arises we can consider this one solved. Thanks again, Jay! "
