  body: "It seems to me that this lettering is hand-drawn, since the e's seem slightly
    different. You might find something similar by searching for \"wood type\", or
    \"Western\".\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Adrian Frutiger's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/westside/|Westside]]
    is the most similar font I have found so far.\r\n\r\nGarry, in the future, please
    use an image instead of PDF, and please try to use a more descriptive title. It's
    hard for us to find a thread with such a common title, if they all say the same
    thing. \"IVOR the engine\" would have been a great title, as an example.\r\n\r\n-
