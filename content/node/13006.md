  image:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.syssol.ca/images/sub/4a_Rnav.jpg\r\n\r\nThere are also
  other examples of this font all over the main page of our website - http://www.syssol.ca/main.htm
  .\r\n\r\nWe had this site developed 3-4 years ago, however the developers apparently
  \"lost\" the CD containing the PSDs, fonts, etc.  One of the guys contacted them
  and tried to ascertain the name of the font, but to no avail.  We're doing an update
  and I can't for the life of me find the font, which is making the creation of new
  buttons rather difficult.  ;)  Thanks for any help you may be able to provide.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n-
  Nick"
