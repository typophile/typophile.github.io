  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any typeface suggestions for botanical gardens&rsquo;s wayfinding signages?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on wayfinding project for a well-maintained 165 years old botanical gardens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at FF DIN as my typeface choice at the moment, but still unsure about it, since its a park/garden, there will be more time for people to read/study signs, is DIN the best choice? Yes, it definitely can communicate with a clear voice, but does it connect to its environment (natural, plants, life)? Or the &lsquo;connection&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t matters in signages?</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Or even maybe, you could have a look at the (free) fonts of Jos Buivenga (@exljbris).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous.
The norm of &ldquo;signage&rdquo; fonts is predicated on maximizing legibility for split-second reading by drivers.
This is a f*cking park, for God&rsquo;s sake, refuge from the automobile&rsquo;s hegemony and mankind&rsquo;s reductive geometry, one would hope!
And it&rsquo;s historic.
Slow down and smell the roses.
Albertus all caps, for instance.</div>

<p>I would also like to support Nicks point: You don&rsquo;t need designated &ldquo;signage typeface&rdquo; in such a case. Just use a typeface that fits your graphic design or the appearance of the park, it&rsquo;s buildings or whatever. 
If you care about the legibility, just make sure that type size, contrast and so on are appropriate.</p>

Much more important is being in harmony with the organic look of the garden. I think that you could even use a script face, like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-g-type/olicana/|Olicana]] and have it work.</p>
<p>Do have a look at the awesome [[http://www.linotype.com/661297/ITCJapaneseGardenOrnamentsOrnaments-font.html|Japanese Garden Ornaments]], and now looking at it, Kobayashi&rsquo;s [[http://www.linotype.com/848/ITCWoodland-family.html|Woodland]] is the kind of thing that I think would be perfect for signage in a garden.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nice that so many agree with me.
I was a bit extreme in relating the cult of legibility signage to driving, because institutional use (hospitals, universities, government buildings) and airports and malls and subway systems all involve ergonomic signage for pedestrians. And the pedestrian precincts that so many European cities have, a concept almost non-existant in North America.</p>
<p>However, even if you&rsquo;re hurrying to make a connection or appointment, does a split second of extra glyph-processing time really make a significant difference?</p>
<p>It may even be that when scanning a long list of names, serifed types are best at disambiguation—e.g. in a medical building lobby when checking to see what floor your doctor is on, and faced with a bewildering array of international names and medical specialties.</p>

I assume it is for the latter. I think there could be room for some personality in some of those institutions, but I can see how that could be a difficult thing to get institutional consensus on. And most institutions probably just don&rsquo;t care or haven&rsquo;t thought about it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wayfinding typefaces for directing people walking in a building have different legibility standards than highway signage.  Speed and distance requirements are much less demanding for pedestrians.  There are plenty of typefaces that would work fine for interiors of buildings that would be marginal for highway signage. &ldquo;Perceived Neutrality&rdquo; is rarely an issue for the reader, but some designers of signage may still cling to this as a desirable trait.  Other designers would choose a face for sense of place or harmony with surroundings, or in an attempt to get a particular feel.  For example, the original post mentions &ldquo;natural, plants, life&rdquo;.  Perhaps they are intentionally looking for a type that might reflect those words reasonably well?</div>

I am just saying that I think institutions (not designers necessarily) are the ones that want these san serif typefaces that Nick is calling ergonomic, and I guess that they are wanting them more for their neutrality than for their legibility.

<p>This might be a good place to mention [[http://www.ada.gov/stdspdf.htm|ADA standards]] for the original poster. They can be helpful in determining placement of the signage as well as design.</p>

Technology has come a long way since then.  It just isn&rsquo;t that tough to use anything you want to make signs anymore.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That does sound like a good reason for the prevailing attitude. And I do see a lot more interesting design happening in the Environmental Design field now, so maybe these preconceptions are being eroded.</p>
<p>I think the obvious answer too, is that a lot of the institutions are using the same &ldquo;signage&rdquo; sort of typefaces in or as their logos/brand/identities. So of course they are going to end up with it in their wayfinding signage by extension. I just heard a lecture
by Michael Bierut where he talked about designing the wayfinding for a Science Center in CT. He looked at the architecture
of the building and got all excited and ran off and had Chester Jenkins (I think that is who he said) design a whole typeface based on the angle of the architecture. When he presented it to the client, they looked phased and said &ldquo;well we have to use Frutiger, that is what our identity is in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I am still curious about wether visitors might actually be looking for an authoritative voice in an institution&rsquo;s wayfinding even if the place itself is not about being efficient. The idea that the wayfinding is somehow this voice outside the place it is representing. Would the visitors at a large amusement park not trust the signs leading to the concession stands and exits if they were set in Hobo?</p>
<p>I guess the answer to the second part of ihio&rsquo;s question — Or the &lsquo;connection&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t matters in signages?— is, like in all design projects, that it really depends on the situation.</p>
<p>Rats, and I thought I was going to come to some empirical knowledge about design on this one.</p>

I came across [[http://www.designindaba.com/video/paula-scher-agi-open-2011|this video by Paula Sher]], which I found really insightful. She talks about &ldquo;environmental&rdquo; typography, and how it can give a building a unique sense of place, which the architecture itself doesn&rsquo;t. I think a garden might present some similar opportunities, though I think it would probably call for something generally more discrete than that Paula Sher has been doing with buildings.</div>

<p>Heck, I&rsquo;ve been places where directional signs were scrawled in marker pen on pieces of cardboard.</p>
<p>Poor design choices may detract from a sign&rsquo;s appearance or legibility, but most users will still trust it unless it&rsquo;s so inappropriate that users think it&rsquo;s a hoax.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks William, that is very helpful and insightful. I like that Paula addresses and identifies the different &ldquo;parts of public space design.&rdquo; 1. being purely informational—wayfinding, navigation, and 2. being inspirational—giving a space it&rsquo;s spirit and expressing the personality of an institution. A choice of typeface and then how it is used could certainly fulfill one, or both of those parts. Or if both parts are not necessary to fulfill, then you would certainly have more options for the expressive part. Or of course just picking 2 different typefaces that go together that fulfill the 2 different needs much like designers do already when combining sans and serif faces, just with different criteria in this case.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is a little neighborhood store near me that deals with vintage comic books and with their collectors.  The signs in the crowded store were all done using Marker Felt.  True, not the most readable choice of face but just perfect for the shop and its clientele :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A little something about sign shops and conservative design&hellip;</p>
<p>In the average sign shop, economy is a strong factor in regards to typography and design. Depending on the scale of the project, the competition is extremely fierce and profit margins are thin. When a graphic designer tells the client that the cost of layouts is going to be x amount of design time and x cost, that is expected. When a sign designer says that there will be x amount of design time at x cost, the client finds someone else. This is not true of every project, but it is frequent enough to be an issue. So, design time is rolled into the cost of the sign. If the design work runs over on time or you decide to use some cool font that you don&rsquo;t currently have, you eat the cost. If the client doesn&rsquo;t like it and goes with a Helvetica clone, you are out the time and money. Each change eats into your profit margin. So, most designs run to the conservative out of economy. If you are a one man operation, you can decide to be creative. If you are a wage slave, the boss is going to complain that your taking too long on the design. In large shops, which score the sweet, high profile jobs, the costs of design and new fonts can be spread over a larger invoice and is to be expected. With many interior wayfaring projects, the production costs are almost always more than the client expects because they have ignored the fact that they need a large number of signs.</p>
