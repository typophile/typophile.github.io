    doubt it could be it (or almost completely redrawn). For this kind of logo, best
    thing to do if you need it as vector is to retrace it. \r\nSome alternatives with
    open /R: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/los-andes/moderna|Moderna]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipografiaramis/dee-dee|Dee
    Dee]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/renova|Renova]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/code-pro|Code]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/litera|Litera]]\r\nMany techy freebies have
    a /R with a similar approach too: DaFont [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Sci-Fi
