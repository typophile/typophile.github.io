body: "Two Things\r\n\r\n1) I had an idea a while back, that it would be very informative
  for me, and for the ending audience, to make a nice detailed animation of creating
  a typeface.   Animating the grid being built, calling out the x-height, baseline,
  etc. Showing the base shapes and pure forms, and building out the letters.  Maybe
  even showing how the other weights are created, etc.  Maybe this would be best for
  something like Helvetica due to all the fanfare, or maybe a more classic font, I'm
  not sure.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nso this brought me to #2\r\n\r\n2) So I've always loved
  fonts, I never took a class, or dug deeper than reading \"The Elements Of Typographic
  Style\".  Which was super informative, but sort of left me reeling. I would really
  like to find something that is detail driven, about the process of building out
  a grid, making some decisions and rules to follow, what shape to build first, second
  third, what letter to build first, second third, maybe some details about variation,
  etc, something with how the weights, and serifs come into play.   But most of all
  I'd just like to get started on making my own basic all caps headline font.  I'm
  well versed in illustrator, and have done pieces of the overall process, and I could
  definitely make it up as I go, and end up with letters that look like the alphabet...
  \ This would still leave me with an unsettled feeling of maybe not doing something
  right, or not following some basic rules, etc. I've never really felt I had a good
  grasp on the core theory, and the basic process...  can anyone point me in the right
  direction?\r\n\r\nMy ultimate goal is to be able to figure out 2, so I can boil
  down the information, and hopefully make a beautiful version of 1, so that the rest
  of the world may understand type a little better, and in turn I would be a better
  designer overall. \r\n\r\nThanks"
