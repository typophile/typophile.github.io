body: "Looking for a classical Dutch typeface other than those by DTL and Teff (which
  I can\u2019t afford), I hit upon Monotype\u2019s Van Dijk. The regular shape looks
  clean and readable, and some alternative figures are simply delightful (look at
  the three!). Unfortunately, the italic is said to be so badly designed and so poorly
  spaced \u201Cthat makes it a very uninteresting font to use in digital form\u201D.
  (Norman Walsh) \r\nMy issue: does anyone know Van Dijk? Or have seen it somewhere
  applied? Is it worth to be bought regardless of the italic? Thank you!\r\n"

    Dijck comes in for a hammering in Bringhurst's opinion too.\r\n\r\nI like to tell
    myself I can't afford TEFF typefaces either, but you might like to look at the
    very reasonably priced work of the <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/index.php\">Storm
    Type Foundry</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/\">Font Bureau</a> instead,
    both of whom do beautiful work (Regent, Farnham) inspired by Dutch baroque typefaces."

  body: Thank you for your hints, I've never noticed Regent and Farnham. I've also
    realized that the spelling of Van Dij(c)k is a little bit messy all over the web.
    You're right, it's Van Dijck.

    or Dutch-styled digital typeface, but I was wrong. Gerard Unger''s Hollander is
    also new to me. Of course, Janson would be an interesting choice. I know one thing
    now: it won''t be Monotype Van Dijck.'
