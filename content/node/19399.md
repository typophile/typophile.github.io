  body: "@Pieter: you're linking to the *old* typeface. I've read somewhere that some
    CI-agency did a redesign a couple of years ago. My guess is that Robin is referring
    to the redesigned typeface.\r\n\r\nFrom \r\nhttp://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/learning/online_resources/ecobus_omnibus/pg/1919a.htm\r\n\r\n\"Wherever
    you go in London, you will see London Transport's famous roundel logo. It first
    appeared as a solid red circle in 1908, and later evolved into a red circle which
    was registered as a trademark by 1918. The proportions were adapted to suit the
    new corporate typeface, Johnston Sans, designed by the calligrapher, Edward Johnston
    (1874-1944) in 1916. Pick had hired Johnston to create a more harmonious and balanced
    typeface than previously available. A modified version of Johnston's typeface,
    New Johnston, is still used by London Transport today.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the wikipedia:\r\n\"Typography\r\nEdward
    Johnston also designed Transport for London's (TfL) distinctive sans-serif typeface
    in 1916. A version of the typeface, since modified to include a lower case, continues
    in use today, and is called \"New Johnston\". The new typeface is noted for the
    curl at the bottom of the minuscule l, which other sans-serif typefaces have discarded,
    and for the diamond-shaped tittle on the minuscule i and j, whose shape also appears
    in the period / point / full stop and as the origin of other punctuation marks
    in the face. Transport for London \"is the owner of all rights of copyright and
    otherwise now existing in the New Johnston typeface\"; but a close approximation
    of the face exists in the TrueType computer font Paddington (not be confused with
    a different, very thick and slightly seriffed font of the same name).\"\r\n\r\nThe
    good news is that you can request the font through this government agency:\r\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/about/corp-design/fonts-click-through-license-delf.shtml\r\n"
