  It appears to be a derivative of Palatino but is not exactly that. Palatino's serifs
  are not quite as straight and the bottom of the right leg on the N is not square
  but pointed.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Hard to say what exactly fails, without bug reports. I myself had no problems.\r\n\r\nDee,

  body: "Sorry, image was CMYK and I see reading the FAQ about posting it has to be
    RGB. \r\n\r\nHave tried RGB jpeg, grayscale whatever and it will not let me attach.
    (even a PDF which FAQ's say are \"not preferred\" but taken if necessary.\r\n\r\nEmergency
    rush has passed, but I would still like to know the font for future applications.
    I will work at uploading in the future because you guys are great on pegging these
    fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks \r\nDee"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cherokee_4439.jpg]\r\n\r\nI think the
    space in the title was the issue. I renamed and it attached this time. As I mentioned
    in earlier post, the closest I can come is a version of Palatino, but that is
    not spon on.\r\n\r\nOriginal may have been customized...I am not sure. Any suggestions.\r\n\r\nDee
