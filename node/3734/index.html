		<div class="commentbody">Each time you download/buy a font, there is a textfile included. &#40;Almost every time.&#41; Usually, the designer/company says that it&#39;s not allowed to modify the font. But if it says: &#34;take this font and do whatever you want with it&#34;, i guess that is to be considered as &#34;open source&#34;... &para;Speaking as a type designer, I can imagine it is a sour experience if somebody else custom-modifies your font and sells the custom work for more money than you will ever earn just by making the font in the first place. &para;The Swedish phone company <A HREF="http://www.telia.se/" TARGET="_top">http://www.telia.se/</A> had their design bureau change Bliss, so that the upper case W was a bit different. I can imagine that wasn&#39;t cheap, and what does J. Tankard think about that? Ericsson Mobile <A HREF="http://www.ericsson.se/" TARGET="_top">http://www.ericsson.se/</A> apparently has &#34;their own&#34; cut of Helvetica Neue &#40;or is it Akzidenz Grotesk?&#41; - anyway, I can&#39;t see the damn difference. And where does the money go? In the design bureau&#39;s pocket? Not to the type foundry or the type designer, I believe... Contact the type designer if you are able to find him/her. I think that is the morally right thing to do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> &#62; When does a &#34;revival&#34; become ethically unsound? <BR> <BR>That&#39;s a very interesting question. For example, one of the entries in Bukvaraz was just disqualified because it was based on Stone Sans. I don&#39;t know exactly what line the designer took, but to me the result is so different that it&#39;s almost a moot point. Nobody would use that font instead of Stone Sans. Sure, the intentions matter too, but don&#39;t we have bigger fish to fry? And I wonder, would it have been OK fifty years from now? If I had a dime for every type designer who&#39;s benefited from the fact that Jenson is dead... <BR> <BR>Besides the ethical stance, there&#39;s also the &#34;cultural&#34; one: overly literal revivals are good for making money, otherwise they suck. There have only been two fonts I&#39;ve wanted to revive so far, and one of them I&#39;d never do. The other is actually in the planning stages, but only because it&#39;s a totally unique text design that simply doesn&#39;t exist in digital form, in any guise. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Jen, it would indeed be good to have a list of &#34;open&#34; fonts, with sources. By &#34;open&#34; I mean fonts that you can just download, modify, resell &#40;or at least redistribute&#41;, etc. Not that there&#39;s a lot of them, certainly not a lot of quality ones. But for example isn&#39;t there a &#34;Times&#34; like that somewhere? <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> hallo jaques, <BR> <BR>i&#39;ve done a few font modifications for clients of mine and have been wondering about the legal issues as well. so i asked the AGD &#40;Alliance of German Designers&#41;. they reccomend, that you ask the creator of the original design if its OK with him/her, before starting on the modification. you and your clients definately need to purchase the proper licenses of the original font. make sure your client has done this before delivering and charging your modifications. i think you can also rename the font you&#39;ve modified as long as you keep the original copyright infos included in the font&#39;s database. if the designer of a font that you want to modify isn&#39;t alive anymore, you&#39;ll have to go through the trouble of finding out who inherited the rights. in germany, the copyrights of a design remain valid until at least 70 years post mortem. i&#39;m not sure if they can be extended after that. so, as long as the designer or the owner of the copyright says GO, there shouldn&#39;t be a legal or ethical problem, unless you or your client redistribute or give away the modified typeface. <BR> <BR>simon </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> &#62; ask the creator of the original design if its OK with him/her <BR> <BR>This is medieval guild mentality. <BR>It&#39;s certainly necessary to require purchase of the original by the client and research restrictions on the rights &#40;like the rare case where any modification is prohibited&#41;, and very good to ask for a blessing from the original designer, but &#42;not&#42; to ask for permission from him. Why? For one thing, the fact that the guy is not dead shouldn&#39;t be the determining factor - he himself copied from others, without permission - any design is part of our cultural landscape, and the &#34;original designer&#34; is not entitled to absolute control, just some control &#40;like requiring adherence to the contract&#41;. Also, because the original designer might be an unreasonable, senile hogger. <BR> <BR>There has to be balance - don&#39;t put your head under the guillotine. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

Those looking for professional advice would do well to know that Hrant&#39;s opinions are, shall we say, not very representative of any major type designer other than Hrant.

And yes, scanning printed output of their fonts is still derivative work. <BR>Derivative work without authorization is ILLEGAL. And if you simply take the time to ask permission, you may be surprised at how cool the designers really are. <BR> <BR>I had a request just like this today. Someone wanted me to add CE glyphs to a font package they bought. I told them I&#39;d be willing as long as I get formal permission from the original foundry.

		<div class="commentbody">Actually Janice, there are a few fonts floating around that should be freely modifiable. Check out the <A HREF="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/freefont/" TARGET="_top">GNU-freefonts project</A>. Of course, these are also Times and Helvetica knockoffs. It would have been nice for the GNU freefonts to have been original, but generally speaking you get what you pay for.</div>
