  I could find was Jersey m54 but it's a little heavy and narrow compared to the image
  above. http://www.dafont.com/jersey-m54.font\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions? Doesn't

    Starfleet]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pixymbols/far-marks|PIXymbols FARmarks]],
    [[http://www.dafont.com/jefferies-jaynz.font|Jefferies]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stockbucket/b-52|B-52]],
    [[http://www.dafont.com/amarillo-usaf.font|Amarillo USAF]]\r\nAfter having a closer
    look to the rest of this poster designed by Motoki Koitabashi \u5C0F\u677F\u6A4B\u57FA\u5E0C
    for [[http://www.akaoni.org/works/roadsidesendai.html|Akaoni]], it may appear
    to be a font with at least 2 weights and digits."
