  at the International Printing Museum seek to rescue a collection of approximately
  100 full fonts of antique Ludlow Typecasting matrices, catalog & organize the fonts
  into our working collection & digitize Ludlow Type Specimen books with notes on
  available fonts for letterpress projects. Along with the Museum's other metal, wood
  type fonts, these matrices will be available for casting type to be used by museum
  patrons, graphic designers & letterpress printers nationally for all kinds of projects
  including letterpress poster and business card printing, invitation and greeting
  card printing projects and creative jewelry making and art projects. We will also
  develop and offer training and classes on Ludlow operation and maintenance to ensure
  Ludlow's legacy. The success of the project would make this the largest active collection
  of hot metal type in the world available to the public. That's where we need you!\r\n\r\nSwing
  on over to the kickstarter to view our video, read up some more on ludlow type casting
  and donate if you can.  If you are unable to donate but would still like to support
  the cause please help us out by posting about the kickstarter on twitter facebook
  linkedin g+ or whereever you would like.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the [[www.printmuseum.org
  | International Printing Museum]], thank you very much!\r\n\r\n[[http://kck.st/qpG9iO]]"
