    that was five years ago and since then I\u2019ve generally produced specimen PDFs
    that people may print out, or view online. For dedicated print, I\u2019ve taken
    out a few ads (e.g. in <em>Eye</em> magazine) and been participating in compendium
    volumes, e.g.\u2014\r\n\r\nhttp://shop.gestalten.com/type-navigator.html\r\nhttp://www.slanted.de/shop/yearbook-type-i\r\nhttp://www.amazon.ca/Creative-Characters-Interviews-Font-Designers/dp/9063692242\r\n\r\nI
    think printed specimens will be around for a long time. Quite apart from the issue
    of whether screen will replace print in general commercial work, or their functionality,
    printed specimens are beautiful <em>objets d\u2019art</em> that typographers cherish,
    part of an ancient tradition that still informs design culture, especially typography.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nI was interested in your post and thought I'd offer my perspective.\r\n\r\nYou
    might be shocked to learn this, but in the three years since graduating from my
    Graphic Design degree, I haven't seen a printed specimen once. While I don't often
    design for print (but I do consider typography a key part of my work) I don't
    think that's the reason I don't own any printed specimens. After all, I've got
    nothing against print; my shelves are packed with design books. For me personally
    I tend to collect, organise and refer to sources of inspiration on the computer.
    I can't be alone, as there are many apps dedicated for this purpose. There is
    just so much great stuff online now and it's so easy to collect and quick to refer
    to, I can't really imagine using a book for that reference. So while I rely on
    type specimens, I haven't personally felt the need to have them in print. My books
    tend to be educational, rather than inspiration/reference material. Of course
    if any design book is pleasing enough, I'm having it. Purely in terms of content,
    I've found that design books no longer tend to be of a higher quality than the
    equivalent websites. Or rather, the quality of content on the web has dramatically
    improved in recent years to the extent that I no longer necessarily seek out printed
    media when looking for quality content. Tactile qualities aside, obviously.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that printed specimens will stick around. They are indeed beautiful; I just
    checked out your books. I'll always remember the first font I bought (Tungsten
    by H&FJ) and the reason I bought it in a heartbeat was because of the fantastic
    specimens that demonstrated the font in use. I don't need to see them in print
    to appreciate them, especially now with retina displays. When I'm looking for
    a new fonts for a project, I find it difficult to judge the quality (and qualities)
    of a font unless I can see some well made examples. I often see those in emails
    and websites of foundries, but I don't see them as much as I'd like to, and hardly
    ever to H&FJ standards.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps with your enquiry."

  body: ">  I don't own any printed specimens\r\n\r\nMe too. Back in the days when
    I ordered type from commercial typesetters I used to have several large binders
    on my shelf full of specimens, but those days are gone. \r\n\r\nAs Nick said,
    printed samples can be cherished as things of beauty. And perhaps in specialized
    areas like maybe book publishing they are still used, and of course print shops
    and sign shops still have lists of available fonts to show clients, but in general
    I don't think graphic designers or others use high-quality printed type specimens
    much anymore. "
