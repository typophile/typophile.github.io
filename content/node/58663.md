body: "Hi All--\r\n\r\nI have this font loaded on my machine, originating from a disk
  that has been passed around my work forever.  Now I have successfully pitched it
  on a huge logo rollout, only to discover I cannot find it anywhere to purchase and
  have a legitimate licensing agreement.  On my machine, it is identified as Simplix
  Bold.\r\n\r\nI've been to whatthefont and identifont, and they both lead me to an
  Emigre font called Triplex, but there are significant differences, for example in
  the lowercase \"a\" and \"e\".\r\n\r\nAny ideas?  Thanks so much!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/identify_5067.jpg]"

  body: "Wow, this goes waaaay back. It was released by an LA-based typesetting company
    that dabbled in type design in the early days of Fontographer. I remember seeing
    an article in Step-by-Step Graphics (later Step: Inside Design, which folded recently)
    that detailed the design process. The designer was very open about his admiration
    of Triplex and his desire to make a similar face.\r\n\r\nMaybe this description
    will help jar the memories of other early-DTP vets. There's a chance that I still
    have the type specimen, but it'll be a week or two before I have time to check.
    Frankly, I'll be surprised if the company that issued the font is still in business.\r\n\r\nThere's
    not a lot of subtlety here, and you'd be within your legal rights (as I understand
    them) to redraw the characters for the logo. Then you can choose another, better-drawn,
    legally available face as a complement."

    the file details? Sometimes copyright info can be found there.

    site</a>, but not surprising, given its similarity to Triplex."
