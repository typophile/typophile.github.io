  body: "Sophie:\r\n\r\nTypophile is the wrong place for such requests. Most people
    here (including me) strongly believe that fonts don\u2019t grow in trees and therefore
    the type designer deserves to be paid for his/her job, just as anybody else. \r\n\r\n>
    Any Suggestions???\r\n\r\nIn the case of the font you are looking for, my suggestion
    is to get a license from [[http://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?PBloUn.html|here]],
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/blockhead/|here]], or [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/emigre/blockhead_alphabet_unplugged/|here]]."
