  body: hey ricardo, you can enlarge the type as this is a flash file. if you&#39;re
    on a mac hold down the control key and click on the immage and choose zoom in.
    on a pc i&#39;m sure all you need to do is right click on the image to access
    the zoom option.

  body: This is really very fresh&#42;. And some of the glyphs are right on, but many
    will need a lot of work. The &#34;c&#34; for example needs more curl at the bottom,
    I think. And try making the stem of the &#34;f&#34; taper thinner towards the
    bottom. <BR> <BR>&#42; In fact I think it&#39;s too gentle to be called Paprika.
    It&#39;s more like... blueberries? What&#39;s &#34;blueberry&#34; in Hungarian?
    <BR> <BR>In terms of texture, it&#39;s jumpy - but that&#39;s to be expected -
    it&#39;s a natural part of the design - just tighten it up though, it might make
    it all suddenly take hold. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: A lot of the glyphs are very nice, the lowercase z is gorgeous, and I love
    the ligatures. I think Hrant is right when he says about the texture of it, it
    doesn&#39;t look quite complete to my eyes.

  body: Very nice work.  <BR> <BR>I wonder about the top of the lowercase i, which
    is different from j and the first/leftmost stem of the other letters. &#40;If
    you want the i and j to be different, so be it, but at least make the i with the
    taper, and the j be flattop. That way, at least in the specimen where the i and
    j are next to each other, the &#34;leftmost&#34; stem is tapered, and the &#34;other&#34;
    stem is flat. I hope that makes sense.&#41;

  body: looks absolutely gorgeous. my only complaint is that the spacing looks kinda
    wonky &#40;uneven&#41;, but i&#39;m the wrong person to talk to about that. the
    only thing that really bothers me is that the Hungarian umlaut on the lc o collides
    with the following l &#40;small L&#41;. Other than that i think you&#39;ve done
    a fine job! keep up the good work.
