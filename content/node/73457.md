  font. The completed family will be san serif for headline and display usage. I've
  compared weights of several san serif typefaces and there doesn't seem to be any
  real solid rules concerning these weights. \r\n\r\nSo, how does one determine the
  weight of the regular verses bold weights?\r\n\r\n\r\nJLS"

    in \"n\".\r\n\r\nSome designers also consider stem width as a proportion of vertical
    height."

  body: I find it useful to keep ADA guidelines in mind when working out weights.
    No need to feel overly constrained by them but, 1:10 stroke width:cap height is
    the lightest allowable weight and 1:5 is the boldest. These work out to a light/thin
    and a medium/demibold.
