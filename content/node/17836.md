  on text rendering in Quark 7 sparked some discussion about various antialiasing
  methods. It was noticed that subpixel antialiasing appeared to be disabled in Quark
  and Pages even when it was on systemwide. There has been some discussion and speculation
  about this elsewhere culminating in <a href=\"http://www.michelf.com/weblog/2006/subpixel-antialiasing-achilles-heel/\">an
  explanation by developer Michel Fortin</a>.\r\n\r\nBasically, you can't have subpixel
  anti-aliased text when it's on a transparent layer and you don't know what it's
  going to be composited against. At least not without a performance hit. Graphics
  applications typically displaying their text in such a context which is why they
  fall back to pixel-level anti-aliasing. \r\n\r\nI would suspect this would also
  be true with ClearType on Windows. Is it?"

  body: "I'm a bit skeptical of the explanation. You always antialias to the background,
    if you don't you get some nasty haloing etc., obviously this requires more processing
    than assuming you're antialiasing to a solid background - but I'm not sure that
    the rasterizer has a  mode where it assumes this. The engineers report that ClearType
    rendering is a bit slower than regular antialiasing but not that much slower.
    The only time I notice perf problems is when the text is displayed against an
    animated background, due to the constant redraw when the background changes.  \r\n\r\nAny
    how I'll direct the engineers to this thread and hopefully they can chime in WRT
    ClearType. \r\n\r\nEdit - comment from the lead ClearType engineer...\r\n\r\n>From
    a system point of view we keep the alpha channel and then blend that with the
    active foreground/background.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "I probably should point out that I intentionally disabled the full color
    anti-aliasing on Panther, which is where the screenshot was made. It just wasn't
    good enough on Panther, better on Tiger but still not there for reading large
    amounts of text.\r\n\r\nI still don't know what Quark uses but it was close enough
    to Pages that it could just be ATSUI.\r\n\r\nIf you don't anti-alias to the background
    but the rendering is done separately of the rest of the screen imaging, it must
    be done on the graphics board's DSP/GPU directly since you'll need more than 8bit
    per channel to do this in a way that's presentable. At least that's what I noticed
    when rendering outlines to pixels (no, not in Photoshop). \r\n\r\naRGB seems odd
    to me, it would imply that the Alpha channel is rendered <em>first</em> then the
    rest. In theory it wouldn't make much of a difference if you fill a mask or if
    you cut with a mask. In theory\u2026 might be just a typo.\r\n\r\nSo anti-aliasing
    to the background makes sense on Windows XP as you never know what kind of graphics
    board your software might end up on.\r\n\r\nAt what bit-depth does ClearType operate
    internally? - Or ATSUI (color) for that matter?\r\n\r\nI can only guess about
    both as the fringing types look similar given that the objective for ClearType
    is sharpness and of ATSUI it is for longer reading. While the CT approach is better
    for the type designer, I'll always look at it from the view of a type user.\r\n\r\nTo
    the MichelFortin issue with Pages: I think once Apple stops supporting Panther
    and earlier versions this won't be an issue anymore. You can simply hand-off your
    rendering operations directly to the GPU with CoreImage."
