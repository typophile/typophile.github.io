  Given that it comes with CS/CS2 I should be seeing it all over the place, but I
  don't really see it much at all. \r\n\r\nAm I just blind to use of this font? Or
  is it being overlooked in favor of Adobe Garamond, Caslon, Minion, etc.?"

    over-exposed! Why do you care if it's been noticed or not? If you like it, giddyup!

  body: I saw it several times in Barcelona and Madrid (before ATypI Lisbon), more
    often than I'm used to, so maybe the Spanish have an affinity for it.

  body: jpad, you're in luck...opposite page 140 of the current (Nov. 27) issue of
    The New Yorker is a bound-in Christmas gift booklet from Barnes & Noble whose
    text is set in Warnock Pro. Interestingly, it seems to be the subhead weight,
    slightly lighter than the regular Pro weight and therefore cleaner on coated stock,
    as with this piece. So you see Warnock and also its optical weight options. Looks
    great, by the way!

  body: That reminds me that one of the first places I saw Warnock Pro in use was
    inside a Barnes & Noble. They had made signs and put them all over the store,
    and a lot of them were artificially condensed. :-(

title: Warnock pro in magazines? Or anywhere of significance?
