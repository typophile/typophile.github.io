body: "Back in the day, the broadcast news organization where I worked produced news
  copy in ALL CAPS.\r\n\r\nThis was not a typographical decision, merely a legacy
  of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code|Baudot code]] used to drive the
  wire service (a/k/a \"Teletype\") machines we used.\r\n\r\nLater the printers were
  modernized to dot matrix and then daisy wheel models, but ALL CAPS was still the
  format.\r\n\r\n(The theory was that it was faster to type without hitting the shift
  key. When we did change to mixed-case scripts, much time and energy was expended
  on deciding what words should be capitalized, but I digress....)\r\n\r\nFast forward
  to today, when I have data files with thousands of those scripts, and I want to
  print a bunch of them.\r\n\r\nTo avoid a very tedious conversion task, and to maintain
  historic accuracy, I want to keep them in ALL-CAPS \u2014 and in a monospaced font
  at that. For aesthetic reasons, I want all documents in the same font, regardless
  of the era of creation (and thus, how the original document appeared when printed
  on its contemporary printer).\r\n\r\nSo I ask the Typophile community for thoughts
  on a (relatively) legible, monospaced, font that will not be too hard on the reader
  and won't require massive leading to be legible.\r\n\r\nAlso, because this is a
  non-revenue project, I especially appreciate open-source or otherwise budget-friendly
  solutions.\r\n\r\nI've tried the handful of monospace fonts I have on hand, and
  don't like what I'm seeing. Maybe the task is hopeless, but I'm confident that if
  there's a reasonable solution, a Typophile-phile will know it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nArtMan"

    tedious, you could do it in seconds by pasting the text into a blank Word document,
    select all, and then select Format > Change Case > Sentence Case.  (Or put it
    in Title Case if you preferred.)  \r\n\r\nThere might be a bit of cleanup, like
    if there was an acronym you wanted to keep in all caps, but in general it should
    be very fast.\r\n\r\nNot as historically accurate, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
