body: I'm new to the whole sell your font thing.  I was wondering if I could get some
  help wrapping my head around the different approaches.  Can you sell fonts on your
  own website with a EULA and be just fine?  Does myfonts.com take too much of your
  money? Do foundries buy fonts from independant designers?  What are some ways of
  selling your fonts and if anyone has some good firsthand expirience that'd be great.
  thanks
