body: "\r\nCharles Fenoughty has just returned from China representing Clear Focus
  at the Dragon Design Festival in Dalian. We were invited by The Guanghua Foundation
  as part of a UK delegation put together by Dr Zhen Ye of the University of Hertfordshire
  and Xiamen University.\r\n\r\nThe Dragon Design Festival was part of the Chinocs
  2008 programme of events and was a large trade show ranging across all design disciplines.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
  at a major roundtable discussion on design in China \u2013 a meeting which brought
  together several heads of industry, including Xio Yon the designer of the Olympic
  medal for 2008 \u2013 Charles put forward to opinion that design in China and the
  UK aren\u2019t as different as so many people say. Highlighting the cyclical nature
  of influence and dispelling the myth that we are more developed in the UK for design,
  after all China had printing 1000 years before us. For both countries there\u2019s
  as much inspiration looking backwards as there is forwards.\r\n\r\nMany interesting
  meetings were had in Dalian and as a result we\u2019ll be looking to do more in
  China, so watch this space.\r\n"
