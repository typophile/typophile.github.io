  face in the picture. It's from a D&AD brochure. I'm also wondering if it comes in
  a three-line variety (in addition to the four lines here)?\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

    'Art Deco Display Alphabets' book, published by Dover. It matches your sample
    for the way the letters are formed and lined (unlike Prisma, by the way), just
    that it has three lines and not four. I could not find a digital font with this
    name, however, so if it exists, the name has been changed (most likely).\r\n\r\n-

  body: "A belated thank-you to you both! I ended up using an outlined Din and offsetting
    the path to get the inline. I wonder if your method would have been better Nick.
    I'll give it a try if the client goes for that logotype.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
