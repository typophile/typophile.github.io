  will emulate the ornamental features of the headline in the attached image.\r\n\r\nI'm
  referring to THE CHAUTAUQUA -- the ornament elements being used sparingly and to
  great effect here.\r\n\r\n2. suggestions for a font similar to the other letters.
  I think there are 3 different fonts going here.\r\n\r\n     a. The non ornamented
  font in the headline... a kind of Copperplate, perhaps, but more robust, yes?\r\n\r\n
  \     b. font on lines 2? No idea\r\n\r\n      c. font on line 3? No idea\r\n\r\n\r\n3.
  Finally, what would be a good font to use alongside  this image in a poster? Something
  that will complement and pair well with these fonts, without replicating them.\r\n\r\nMost
  grateful in advance for any input... (I know this is a lot to ask!) \r\n\r\nMany
  thanks!"

    Fonts]]. You'd probably find there some interesting alternatives to these fonts.\r\nA
    quick search at [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/VICTORIAN/|MyFonts using \"Victorian\"
    as keyword]] should probably be useful too: catchwords, ornaments, fonts..."
