  body: Don&#39;t you think this might be custom? It&#39;s possible  <BR>they&#39;ve
    used Helvetica Condensed or something like  <BR>that as a basis, but I doubt this
    exists as a readymade  <BR>typeface.

  body: 'BTW now that I look at it again: the lc &#39;a&#39; looks  <BR>very clunky:
    the spot where the curve of the bowl  <BR>joins the stem is not optically corrected
    at all,  <BR>which reinforces my impression this is &#34;hand-made&#34;.'

  body: It looks like the a is a mirror image of the lower-case s, with part cut off
    and a stem added, no?

  body: I think so too. The ending of the top curve looks as  <BR>if it has been widened
    a tad, but the rest of it is a  <BR>mirror image of the &#39;s&#39; indeed.
