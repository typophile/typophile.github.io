body: "I'm a student about to have my final review before graduation, and I've been
  agonizing over the type in my resume/business card. Because of administrative idiocy
  I was unable to take the advanced typography class but have tried my best to progress
  on my own, but my confidence is shaky and I'm somewhat unsure of myself. I've done
  a lot of lurking on these forums and many of my decisions regarding type and format
  of this resume are inspired ideas I've seen here, as I'm sure you'll notice.\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to communicate that I love clean, simple design that shows a respect and
  inspiration from the past while embracing the current. I also want to show some
  friendliness, cleverness, humor. I love classic, tried and true typefaces but am
  constantly infatuated with fun, new beautiful options. I'm dying to get into the
  professional environment and learn. I'm just now really trying to develop my own
  sense of what faces go together well based on proportions, origin, etc. I feel like
  that's somewhere many of my typophobic classmates might be pretty lacking. \r\n\r\nIf
  the 2 typefaces are just too much, let me know and I'll pare it down. As for suggestions
  of other typefaces, I have a surprisingly good selection of (many probably pirated..
  ugh) typefaces at work so chances are I'll have access to whatever you're suggesting.
  I can spend a little money on purchasing a typeface if I fall in love with it and
  it's not overly pricey.\r\n\r\n I've posted 2 versions of my resume, which is on
  my personal letterhead. My personal information on the letterhead is basically my
  businesscard, so I would love an independent critique of that as well. I can post
  an image of that alone if needed.\r\n\r\nOne is set in Trade Gothic LT Std - Bold
  Condensed No. 18 and Proforma\r\n\r\nThe other version is set in Dolly and Auto
  2\r\n\r\nTear it up! I can take it. And thanks =)\r\n\r\nps - No fine kerning has
  been done yet, just fyi"

  body: "Of the two, I'd definitively go for the Trade Gothic/Proforma-version - it's
    just that much cleaner, lighter and more consistent on the retro-feeling\u2026\r\n\r\nThe
    four different cuts (Proforma small-caps, italic and book and the Trade Gothic)
    is a bit much for me - but I'm not sure how I'd scale it down... Perhaps try something
    different for the subheads (the Proforma Italics)\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd, I'm not sure
    if I agree with myself on this one, but how about letting the bullets line up
    with those subheads? I mean, every level already has a different typographic style,
    I don't think the indentation really needs to be <em>that</em> prominent..? I'd
    also consider just a little more leading..?\r\n\r\nOh, and you're missing an fi-ligature
    in the \u2018business card\u2019-field - \u201Cpurveyor of <strong>fi</strong>ne
    graphic design services\u201D... And, not having ever been a great fan of Proforma
    I've never checked - but Proforma doesn't have ff-ligatures?\r\n\r\nBut all in
    all, I think you've done a great job on these! Loving the clean, retro look! Good
    luck job-hunting!"

  body: "I think I agree with pretty much all of your suggestions. I've been staring
    at it so long it's hard to see what little things can improve it. Thanks for noticing
    the ligature too!\r\n\r\nI've uploaded the version with the little edits to the
    main post."

  body: I like the Trade Gothic/Proforma version as well. What really communicates
    your design approach is the left section in the blue box, but I also think that's
    the part that needs the most work. Everything is too small and tight in that section.
    Add some space in there, leading, and also some space between the info and the
    blue box, it just seems crammed. And the type seems small compared to the copy
    to the right.

    the Dolly and Auto combination because I feel it has a very cute character. I
    think the composition is fairly clean (which is cool) but maybe you could use
    your grid a bit more \u2013 your only using one column. This could help you to
    break down the information into yummy bite sizes rather the huge mouth-fulls.
    I don't mind your typeface choices but I think the positioning and composition
    could be improved.  "
