body: "Hi there\r\n\r\nI'm writing a script for optimizing my kerning algorithm. so
  I need to get bitmap outputs of glyphs in FontLab. I tried to render it using PIL
  but FontLab scripting features didn't tell me position of all nodes -> using postscript
  curves, there is no data about control points (handles) of nodes in the 'nodes'
  list of a glyph. So images that the script generates are not precise enough to expand
  kerning scale.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get such image directly? fore example to
  get an image of a certain glyph in a given em. I know FontLab uses FreeType to render
  glyph shapes. I have installed sip library. so could I use some API of FontLab to
  accomplish?"

    <code>points</code> list to get all the point positions.\r\n\r\nCheck out the
    FontLab Python documentation if you haven\u2019t already: http://www.e-font.de/flpydoc/\r\n\r\nThere
    is <code>Glyph.Rasterize()</code>, but I'm not sure you can control the ppm size.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps,\r\nJens"

  body: "twardoch,\r\n\r\nOf course it will be easier than generating image from curves,
    but I can't use <code>Rasterize()</code>. I just call <code>Rasterize()</code>
    for generating bacground image :-/ Trying to write some <code>FLtoPIL</code>,
    I used <code>Glyph.image</code> but it just gives me a binary image that the glyph
    is tightly bounded into it. So baseline and metrics of a glyph are missed in the
    final output:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/W_4049.jpeg],[img:sites/default/files/old-images/e_5008.jpeg]\r\n\r\nI
    need an image with applied metrics of glyph (left,right,ascender,descender). but
    can't calculate scale of image to generate such an output..."

  body: "You need to calculate the offsets yourself, based on the original glyph's
    bounding box. I'm not sure how you'd expect it to work directly, i.e. how e.g.
    you'd expect the baseline to be \"stored\" in the image for a letter such as \"p\"?
    \r\n\r\nWhen you're generating a background image in FontLab Studio, the image
    is rendered at the ppem size determined by FL.Options().BitmapSize. If you set
    BitmapSize to 1000 then one pixel in your image will correspond to one font unit
    in a 1000 UPM font (Font().upm). If you set BitmapSize to 200, then one pixel
    will correspond to 5 font units in such a font. So there you have the scaling
    factor you need. \r\n\r\nBy calling Glyph().GetBoundingRect(), you'll get the
    actual position of the glyph drawing within the design space (in font units).
    By querying for Glyph().width, you get the advance width. From the difference
    of GetBoundingRect().ll.x and .ur.x, and Glyph().width, you'll easily get the
    sidebearings, and from .ll.y, you'll get the position relative to the baseline.
    All in font units, but you can then convert them to pixel dimensions by comparing
    Font().upm and Options().BitmapSize. \r\n\r\nAs for the maximal y dimension to
    which you should crop your images, there are various scenarios possible. You could
    crop to the height of the font's bounding box -- which you'd need to calculate
    yourself by iterating for Glyph().GetBoundingRect() for all glyphs and choosing
    the maximal value -- or you could crop e.g. to one of the vertical dimensions
    (such as OS/2.WinAscent and OS/2.WinDescent, but then you're risking that some
    of your glyphs may be cropped too much. \r\n\r\nIt all depends on what you really
    need this information for. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
