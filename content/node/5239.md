    <BR>You&#39;ll have more luck posting GIFs or JPGs, so folks can see the sample
    without having to download it.

  body: I&#39;m quite sure it&#39;s from a metal type Spanish foundry, probably by
    Carlos Winkow or Enric Crous Vidal, but I can&#39;t find any reference. <BR> <BR>:--&#40;

    Bisonte issued by the Iranzo foundry in the forties.

  body: Great, Mark! That what I was looking for. I was browsing through the Enciclopaedia
    of Typefaces, but I didn&#39;t  caught it; it&#39;s here just in the middle of
    page 255... <BR> <BR>Bisonte is a sans. Perhaps Troucht made more versions for
    the Iranzo foundry. Unfortunately I haven&#39;t any Iranzo catalog.

  body: Yeah, that&#39;s where I found it. I probably should have mentioned that in
    the ID.

  body: Recently Andreu Balius &#40;Type Republic&#41; has made a font inspired in
    the type Bisonte &#40;designed by Joan Trochut&#41;, calling it <a href="http://www.andreubalius.com/typerepublic/trochutA.html"
    target=_top>Trochut</a>. <BR> <BR>Very close in the style, with that T, not a
    match though. <BR>
