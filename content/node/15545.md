  body: "The text is Minion. The timeline on the left and the heading are in various
    forms of Franklin Gothic. I can\u2019t quite make out the \u201CTECHNOLOGY\u201D
    and \u201CTHERAMINS THROUGH TIME,\u201D but I\u2019m pretty sure I have seen it
    somewhere on my system. You ought to try going to www.identifont.com/ where they
    will ask you a number of questions about the font (like serif or non-serif, rounded
    or not, etc.) and amazingly, it will usually identify the font for you."
