  looking for examples of old buildings retaining their original signage whilst being
  reused and branded for a different function. For example The Michelin Tyre Company
  \u2013 Bibendum Restaurant, London. I have found several in Manchester. If anyone
  knows of any others please can you let me know. Thanks"
