body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nit\u2019s my first post here and I\u2019m sure that every body here
  will help me.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the problem:\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve created a symbol
  font for a contract (it\u2019s a programmation). The purpose of it his to ad scribbles
  in the text in an efficient way. But, even after thousands of tries, FontLab refuse
  obstinately to generate a type 1 font with bitmap preview, wich is exactly what
  I need to use in Quark (There\u2019s still people in the studio who do not know
  InDesign). The only way I can get out of that is by putting a bitmap size of 36,
  wich is not helpful.\r\n\r\nI join some screenshots to let you see the details and
  the result.\r\n\r\nThe document will be printed next week, so I began to freak out
  a bit.\r\n\r\nIf any one can help me, it will be very appreciated\u2026\r\n"

  body: I'd start by filling all the empty character slots with a generic icon of
    some kind.

    you any other idea???\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, I found your conference at Grafika
    2006 about Opentype and softmachine quite interesting!"

  body: "Thanks Alex.\r\n\r\nTry generating it as a Type 1 .otf font -- Quark 7 supports
    those.\r\n\r\nGo through all the \"Font Info\" panels and compare what you've
    entered to a standard commercial font.\r\nThat might address font naming as the
    source of your problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may be a problem with your outlines
    -- especially as your are making graphics, not single characters.\r\n\r\nCan you
    post one of your larger and more gnarly glyphs, so we can see the outlines?"

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nI cannot generate a Type 1 OTf because I\u2019m using Quark
    6.5.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s some screenshots of the more complex glyphs and from the
    Info panel.\r\nBasicly, the glyphs are from an autotrace in Illustrator (I just
    discover that ther\u2019s one in FontLab).\r\nI already check with a commercial
    font but maybe you\u2019ll find something that I didn\u2019t see\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Image-9_3516.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Image-11_5861.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Image-10_5386.jpg]"

  body: "Doesn't look good, there could well be bad paths lurking in there.\r\nYou
    might see better if you turned off the background and just looked at the paths.\r\n\r\nContour
    > paths > simplify paths might be worthwhile.\r\n\r\nAlso you could try successively
    pasting groups of characters from this font into a new font, and seeing when the
    font ceases to compile. Trial and error: to isolate the potential bad characters.
    \r\n\r\nSometimes just copying the characters to a fresh font does the trick.\r\n\r\n"
