  body: 'Nope, it&#39;s not slanted: the original Bookman has an oblique  <BR>roman
    as italic. Unfortunately this particular Swash weight  <BR>isn&#39;t available
    in digital format &#40;whatever the AgfaMonotype  <BR>guys may want to make you
    believe&#41;.'

  body: There actually was a digital version of this design from Castcraft; whether
    or not it&#39;s still available is another question.

  body: Franklin Type Founders, who used to be sold through Precision Type also had
    what they called ITC Bookman Swash &#40;Medium weight  in Roman and Italics&#41;.
    With the demise of Precision Type, apparently this source has vanished as well.
    -- Which is why that link in the thread Mark just took us to no longer works.

  body: I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s exactly the same as the FTF version, but the
    ITC Bookman Swash fonts appear to be available through <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=415684">Monotype</a>.
    It&#39;s the pre-ITC version that is more elusive.
