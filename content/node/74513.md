body: "Would love to pick your amazing brains regarding what character to use after
  an asterisk. I've seen one (*), then two (**) and three (***). Is that acceptable?
  Is there another character one can use without looking outright jarring?\r\n\r\nThe
  context is that a subhead uses an asterisk, and then a product description uses
  one to reference the fine print."

  body: You could use superiors, since they are the logical use for footnotes. Asterisk
    is more commonly used in prose, where footnotes are not that frequent.

  body: Superscript numbers work well. Daggers can work too. Multiple Asterisks can
    look clunky and are difficult to hang in footnotes and disclaimers.

  body: For me multiple footnotes has always meant superscript numbers, doubly so
    if it is a formal or scientific document.

  body: "The traditional way to deal with this is to use asterisk, then dagger, then
    double dagger. Then, according to Chicago Manual of Style, use two asterisks,
    two daggers, etc. \r\n\r\nTraditionally, dagger and double dagger were used pretty
    often. You can also use section marks if need be. But now that numbered end notes
    are more common, the asterisk etc. are most often used for footnotes when you
    have both a footnote and numbered end note. And then usually there aren't so many
    footnotes. After all, the object of the author and designer should be something
    that you can actually read, not a puzzle.   "
