body: "I am in the process of designing a wall calendar, with one page per week. (I
  am using CorelDRAW, if you must know.) I am using the fonts DIN Engschrift and DIN
  Mittelschrift, mainly the latter.\r\nIt being a calendar, numerals are the most
  important characters. I am going for function rather than beauty, but still, I don't
  want an ugly calendar. This is why I chose a road sign font: I want to be able to
  read the date from across the room without my eyeglasses! Also, monospaced figures
  are a must.\r\nI really do not like the way that the days of the week look like
  they are going to turn out, though. Please see the picture. It is a screenshot of
  me testing several fonts in a spreadsheet program. No wonder Wednesday is nicknamed
  \"hump day\"!\r\nPersonally, I do not think that monospaced fonts get enough credit.
  The community here seems to view monospaced fonts the same way early 20th-Century
  America viewed trousers on women: in poor taste, except when required by work.\r\nAlso,
  I don't understand the design of the digits in Arial/Helvetica, and even more, why
  it is default for spreadsheets. If a 6 or a 9 is too curly, you get what looks like
  an 8. A 5 with an almost-closed bottom loop looks like a 6.\r\nAnother reason I
  like the DIN digits is that they are not too wide: this way, they don't gobble up
  the space I intend to use for writing appointment times. This is why I don't move
  to a monospaced font for everything. Maybe MS Gothic would work, but I don't really
  like it: it seems like more of a font for use of a rough draft than on a finished
  product. Besides, its strokes are kind of thin.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/calendar-font-test_3811.png]"

  body: "Any font with tabular lining figures as an OT stylistic set would fulfill
    your needs.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time\u2014when a font was one size and one style
    of a particular typeface, cast in metal\u2014most popular and practical faces
    had add-on sets of tabular figures, which were purchased separately, as was extended
    punctuation. So, calendars were assembled by a skilled typographer, backwards
    and often upside-down. Watching someone hand-set type is a trip, as is watching
    someone operate a Linotype machine\u2026although neither is as trippy as having
    a five-inch-long Giant Hissing Cockroach crawl on your hand\u2026"

    often the default for spreadsheets because of their ubiquity rather than any typographic
    qualities that would lend themselves to this purpose. The current default for
    Excel is Calibri, which I personally think works very well in that context and
    I tend to switch between that and Verdana for spreadsheet work.\r\n\r\nIf I need
    a monospaced font I tend to use either [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html|Anonymous
    Pro]] or [[http://www.lucasfonts.com/case-studies/calibri-consolas/|Consolas]]."

  body: "<cite>Any font with tabular lining figures as an OT stylistic set would fulfill
    your needs.</cite>\r\nNot at all. To give an extreme example, the stroke widths
    of Times New Roman would be quite unsuitable for my needs here.\r\nI would have
    given up and used the American road sign font (no-nonsense, utilitarian, designed
    for reading at a distance), except that the characters are rather fat, so I chose
    the German road sign font instead. I also think that the German font is more attractive
    and maybe a bit more legible. Okay, maybe the American series B or C version would
    be all right, but it would still have some problems with the letters.\r\nAbout
    the letters: I do not like the \"roller-coaster ride\" formed by the days of the
    week in the screenshot I gave. Really, I do not at all like the look of \"Fri\"
    in my examples. Partly because \"r\" and \"i\" are narrow letters, and partly
    because proportional fonts in general smash the \"r\" into the following letter,
    \"Fri\" tends to look horrible. On the clock in my kitchen, it looks just like
    \"Fn\" with a dot over the \"n\".\r\n<cite>You might consider looking for a font
    that has proportional oldstyle figures, like Museo Sans</cite>\r\nHow are oldstyle
    figures, or proportional figures, even relevant?"

    isn't much in the way of monospaced fonts out there, is there?\r\n\r\nMy guess
    is that \"M\", \"W\", \"m\", and \"w\" are the real troublemakers. I don't see
    why those four characters should dictate the rest of the font. I don't see why
    the Cyrillic \"\u043C\" glyph shouldn't be pressed into service for Latin \"m\"
    if it helps save space. And I really don't like the avoidance of straight vertical
    strokes for \"M\". As for \"w\" and \"W\", I am sure font-makers would find a
    way to narrow them if forced. I guess the reason monospaced fonts are so fat is
    really these four characters. Is that right?"

  body: There is generally some level of compromise as a result of narrowing typically
    wide characters or expanding narrow ones so that the additional space is not too
    glaring. I think Consolas handles this very well overall but I would be intrigued
    to see a range of approaches.
