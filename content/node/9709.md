  where it&#39;s suitable to be looked at &#40;i hope&#41;! I started working on this
  before i was up to my eyeballs in Goudy faces. I still like it tho... <BR>This is
  not one of Goudy&#39;s finer types, but i found it charming and may be useful for
  display purposes, even though this is the &#34;text&#34; version. <BR>I want to
  try my hand at two more versions: a cleaned up, sharp &#34;display&#34; version
  and then using the clean version and tweaking it a bit to see if one could actually
  make a working text font based on this design. any tips? shout em out! thnx for
  looking... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67150.gif"

  body: But, Paul, arena likes it a lot. a lot. a lot. <BR> <BR>Seriously, I have
    always liked Village, and I think you&#39;ve done a very good job with this. You
    should probably add the Euro sign to make it exportable, and if you&#39;re going
    to do the copyright symbol, you might as well do registered trademark, too.  <BR>
    <BR>Any plans for small caps?

  body: thnx steve!!! i&#39;m actually missing a lot of characters, but mostly just
    accents and then i can build the diacritics. i hadn&#39;t really thought about
    small caps, but i&#39;m sure they&#39;re a possibility... if i thought more people
    than just me would be interested in this font.

  body: Paul. :^&#40; I can&#39;t believe I missed this. I always viewed Village and
    something of an imperfect typeface with a lot of warmth. Kinda like a favorite
    sweater. There are appropriate places to wear this sweater and inppropriate places
    to wear this sweater. <BR> <BR>I think you have captured that.

    <BR>Well, there&#39;s at least two of us! &#40;I&#39;m a Goudy fan, since both
    of us are central Illinois boys.&#41;  <BR> <BR>I would go wild with all the possibilities
    of OpenType. Small caps, lining figures, etc.
