body: Hello folks, <BR> <BR>I have had a good look for this one but drawn a blank.
  The &#39;M&#39; looks like the font Stop. I have looked through some of the internet
  freeware stuff. I am guessing it is commissioned as it is apparently used as a logo
  on a bicycle. Can anyone here pick it? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39011.gif"

    the gaps in the outline at the bottom of the A, R, and K&#41; which would make
    me suspect this is a free font.
