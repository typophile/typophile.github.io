body: "Hi, I am just about to start working on a logo for a personal training business.
  Have some font ideas but just wondering if anyone could suggest something that would
  really do the job... at the moment I'm looking at Breuer headline but I think I'd
  like something with a little more personality. With a good italic option, moving
  forward and all that!\r\nAny suggestions most welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"
