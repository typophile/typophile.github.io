  worst time trying to create something that matches my hotel vibe.\r\n\r\nI attached
  my moodboard, sample of directions I was going in.. but none of them have been \"winners\"
  and my professor wasn't too excited about any of them (nor was I). \r\n\r\nAlso,
  I really don't want to purchase a font because it's only going to be used for this
  specific logo, so am trying to find free fonts to create this.\r\n\r\nANY help would
  be appreciated, thank you!"

    faces (free ones that comes to mind would be Museo or Luz Sans).\r\nFor something
    more lively, there are the other from Jos Buivenga or the recent AW Conqueror
    fonts by Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez."

    this. Hand drawn seems to be a better way to go based on your mood board. "
