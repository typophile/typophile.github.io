  body: "\"SEA HUNT\" looks like Franklin Gothic Condensed.\r\n\r\nThe \"Underwater
    Fury\" poster has various weights and widths of Futura on it.\r\n\r\nThe U.S.
    Divers ads use Blippo Bold. Each sample uses a different 's'. I don't know what
    the stencil font is.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. that Aqua-Lung logo should go up
    <a href=\"http://www.b3ta.com/features/phalliclogoawards/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."

  body: P.P.S. The sans at the bottom of the second U.S. Divers sample is Univers,
    and the body text of the Sea Hunt ad could be Century.
