  a corporate brochure composed in InDesign 2/WinXP. Now I am facing two problems:
  <BR> <BR><ul><li>When checking the InDesign project with the preflight option, there
  is a warning: 7 fonts used, 0 Missing, 0 Embedded, 2 Incomplete, 0 Protected &#40;JohnstonITCTT
  Bold and JohnstonSCITCTT Bold are denoted as incomplete&#41;. Does anybody know,
  what &#34;incomplete&#34; means? No hints from the manual, searching the web I found
  statements like &#34;got something to do with screen rendering, no problem with
  printing&#34; - though screen rendering is as well as the printout from InDesign
  to local printer. <LI>When offset lithography is produced &#40;I do not know the
  tools used for that process&#41;, the letter spacing is messed up, i.g.:</li></ul>

  <BR>Is that a known issue? Are the problems related to each other &#40;there are
  spacing errors with fonts not marked as incomplete&#41;? ITC is checking the case,
  no answer yet. I manoeuvred around the problem by converting the typo to paths in
  InDesign, but I would rather like to know what&#39;s going on... <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for your input!'
