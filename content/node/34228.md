  University campus. \r\n\r\nI believe it may very well be the same face that is used
  for the 'Sub Pop' record label\u2014perhaps only differing weights.\r\n\r\nWhat
  comes close:\r\nApex (too 'new' and the S is wrong)\r\nZapata (the uneven weights
  ruin the match)\r\nWestern Stencil (a match if only not stencil?)\r\nRodeo (a little
  flat though)\r\n\r\nAnyone have any suggestions? Is there something easy that I
  am missing?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nBrad\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lettermade.com"
