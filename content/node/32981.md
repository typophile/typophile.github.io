body: Hi, I am doing a rate card for a client which entails a lot of 1's and $s. I
  am designing it using Galaxie Polaris, which I really like, but the 1's and $s look
  slightly - clunky - on the piece. Does anyone have any suggestions as to a substitute
  just for these two characters? Is that blasphemy? Am I asking for trouble? Thanks!
