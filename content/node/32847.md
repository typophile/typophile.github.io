body: "Hi everybody, I'm posting my topic because I've never sold a font yet and I
  don't know anything about licences. I've found in my cupboard some old letraset
  press-type fonts. I've decided to digitalize the [[Neil Bold]] by scanning it for
  a school magazine that I'm creating now. Then I realize that a lot of people was
  looking for this font on the Internet and they asked me if I'll sell it. The problem
  is that it was already digitalized by OPTIFonts but they aren't selling it anymore.
  There is also a \"based on\" font which is Alejandro Paul\u2019s Mobley Sans but
  generally it stray far from the look of Neil Bold. Now I'm wondering that if none
  is selling it and if I digitalized it from the original letraset, do I have the
  right to propose my font to a foundry ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: IIRC Monotype owns the rights to Neil Bold now. I could be wrong. But if someone
    does own the rights to it I'd steer clear.

  body: With this evidence; if you've made your own version of Neil Bold, and not
    simply done some copying and pasting, it seems you are in the clear. You just
    have to think of a new name.

  body: Back in 1978 I bought some Chartpak transfer lettering that was named Vector.
    The name of the magazine I was working on at the time. It seemed like the perfect
    set of letterforms for our logo. I found out  a few years later that Chartpak's
    Vector was VGC's Neil Bold. So as long as you don't use the trademarked name I
    can't see a problem as long as you don't mind being a derivative pirate.
