  1904 - 1940? I'm trying to create a painting but need to know the exact font type.
  I've attached two images for reference. Many Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2007-11-15-LB-Subway4_5767.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2007-11-15-LB-Subway1_4331.jpg]"

    The answer may be in <a href="http://aiga.org/content.cfm/the-mostly-true-story-of-helvetica-and-the-new-york-city-subway">this

  body: "Stewf thanks for that subway link. Id not seen it before. Yes, the answer
    is in the article (lettering, not a font)..\r\n\r\n<em>As if this plethora of
    signs were not enough, the subway system also had a bewildering variety of other
    porcelain enamel and hand-painted signs. The porcelain enamel signs, either hung
    from the ceiling or posted on the walls, were directional as well as informational.
    The directional signs included those on the outside of the station entrances as
    well as those intended for the corridors and platforms underground. Many of the
    informational signs warned against criminal, dangerous or unhealthy behavior:
    no peddling wares, no leaning over the tracks, no crossing the tracks, no smoking,
    no spitting. The directional and informational ones were made by Nelke Veribrite
    Signs and the Baltimore Enamel Company, while the behavioral ones were the product
    of the Manhattan Dial Company. Most were lettered in some form of sans serif capitals\u2014regular,
    condensed, square-countered, chamfered, outlined\u2014though some were in bracketed
    or slab serif roman capitals. They were usually white letters on a colored background
    (often dark green for the IND and dark blue for the IRT and BMT), yet many were
    also black on a white background. There was no house style.</em>\r\n\r\nBTW i
    can also recommend the book Subway Style for an overview of the NY subway architecture
    and signage,"

    are several reasons by which it is NOT Helvetica.\r\nOne is the date of manufacturing.\r\nBut
    you can compare (even at a low size, low resolution) some characters' shapes like
    \u20187\u2019, \u2018&\u2019, \u2018C\u2019, \u2018M\u2019, \u2018R\u2019, \u2019S\u2019
    that are very different than those in Helvetica.\r\n\r\nMarcelo Soler"
