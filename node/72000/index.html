  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi. I am studying the printing history of a couple of related books published in Missouri and Ohio in the 1830s. These were printed by small printing operations in small communities. By looking at the paper size for different items, we can get a decent sense of how large the press was. One of the questions we are interested in, trivial as this may seem, is whether they were printing using the sheetwise imposition technique or using the work and turn technique. Does anyone have any clue how common the work and turn technique would have been in this era? Any sources you know of that might address the matter?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Unless you had a perfecting press, printing was always either &ldquo;work and turn&rdquo; or &ldquo;work and tumble.&rdquo; Are you asking how common perfecting presses were, or which technique was most common with single head press?</p>
<p>When I started typesetting books in the 1980s, single head presses for books with a print run of 1,000-2,000 copies were quite common.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your reply, Charles. For sure they did not have a perfecting press. What I am getting at is whether they would have used the sheetwise imposition technique, meaning they printed the front of the sheet on the front, then removed and dried the sheet and changed the plate, after which they turned over the sheet and printed the back. Or instead, using &ldquo;work and turn,&rdquo; would they have printed some front sides and some back sides on the front of the sheet, then turned the sheet over and, without changing the plate, finished the job.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If they did work and turn, then likely the signatures would consist of fewer pages, since the sheet would contain two identical sets of pages. They would have been cut before folding into signatures.</p>
<p>If separate plates were used, then you’d likely find signatures of twice as many pages.</p>
<p>So, if you have a sense of the size of press and sheet size, and you can count out the pages in a folded signature, you should be able to answer your own question. Yes?</p>
