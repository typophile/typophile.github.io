body: The 24s are Crudfont by Scott Yoshinaga, and the &#34;Sticks&#34; is Attic by
  Three Island Press. But what fonts were used for &#34;Lunch Boxes&#34; and &#34;Spicy
  Smoked Snacks&#34;? <BR> <BR>Something freeware or shareware is my first guess.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37966.jpg"

  body: It&#39;s fun working on Slim Jim because they mainly use cheezy freeware grunge
    funts, but it makes it hard to find them later on...

  body: Well, I found &#34;SPICY SMOKED SNACKS,&#34; but it&#39;s on a site where
    the fonts are of dubious authorship, so I&#39;m not inclined to link to it. Compelling
    counterarguments, however, will be entertained.

  body: Oh, all right. It seems from the font&#39;s read-me like it may actually be
    an original, as opposed to a lot of the things on that site. It&#39;s called Garish
    Monde.
