  days. This one is extended more than most. I have attached a quick .gif preview
  and a .pdf for more detailed examination. I think I have a few issues with the weights
  on the n, m and r. Please ignore the preliminary spacing for now. All comments are
  welcome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unicase1_3590.gif]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Jeremy \r\n\r\nI like the ideas of most of your fonts, but you really
    have to spend much more time on the outlines. They are all very bulky and unshaped.
    Furthermore I think that you get stuck on your sketches. You should try to experiment
    a bit with the shapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings: Steven"

  body: "Stephen,\r\n\r\nThank you for your comment. I agree that I tend to get stuck
    on my inital sketches, and I feel I am a in a bit of a rut as far as some of the
    shapes I have been using recently. Thank you for challenging me in that area.\r\n\r\nI
    must admit I am having difficulty locating the bulkiness you mentioned, with the
    exception of a few characters that need work (the Q, n m). I've touched up the
    Q, K, u z g and s, and I will post those revisions shortly. The letterforms are
    deliberately extended more than most. Is that what you are referring to?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJeremy

  body: 'It seems like one of the biggest hurdles in Unicase fonts is the spacing
    since you will be making unusual combinations like ''eP'' all the time.  Overall
    it feels too tight. I would look at some small cap spacing & see what they are
    doing to make that work ( as opposed to regular caps which often look clunky without
    intervention ).  Also, how do you see this being used? That''s important.  '

  body: "For extended text setting - yes. For doing the name of some noodle shop maaaaaybe
    it's okay. I think with some greater sense of purpose good choices can be made.
    BTW Jeremy, you might want to look at some other unicases as well. See what choices
    they made. Nick Shinn has one for instance. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.shinntype.com/\r\n\r\nFourth
    up on the right\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'From a retail point of view they probably are pointless since there has never
    been a popular one. But as a learning process a unicase might be quite useful
    - for learning to see and understand letter relationships. No? But it might be
    a 300 level course not a 100 level... '

  body: "The intended use is logotypes, headlines, etc. It's a display type. I doubt
    too many people would want to set text in a unicase font, especially one this
    wide.\r\n\r\nI agree that the spacing will be difficult, but I've started on it.\r\n\r\nI
    agree with Hrant about the usefulness of a unicase. Really, as far as pure usefulness
    and unicase isn't very versatile, with my apologies to the Bauhaus crew. Despite
    the fact that it\u2019s a unicase, I tried out the g, and felt it worked pretty
    well, so yes, there are a few characters with decenders. Honestly, I understand
    why quite a few people don\u2019t care for unicase typefaces, but part of the
    charm of a unicase font is its inherent inconstancies. But why can\u2019t it be
    successful from a retail point of view? Filosofia is widely used, I would say
    largely because of its unicase weight.\r\n\r\nI've made a number of updates. The
    latest is posted here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unicase2_6284.gif]\r\n\r\nhttp://ftp.insignedesign.com/files/unicase2.pdf\r\n\r\nJeremy
