  is a compilation of glyphs used on signs related to the Hyperion Corporation in
  the game Borderlands 2. \r\nThese are slanted oddly due to perspective of the viewer
  in the reference photos, and because many of the signs use slanted text that changes
  slant across each line. Differing sizes of text are because I left all text at the
  resolution they appeared in the references. \r\nThe signs only use capitals, and
  the period is a square. Most of the font is pretty unremarkable, but hopefully the
  G is distinctive enough to be recognized.\r\n\r\nThe attached file is the unmodified
  image that these were crudely ripped from."
