  to get busy scanning my 1989 copy."

  body: "Thanks. I did find the sanskritweb PDF, but as you are probably aware, it
    doesn't show the full founts. Perhaps I should scan my copy for prosterity's sake,
    plus it may be of interest to some of you Typophiles out there.\r\n\r\nWatch this

  body: "adydog: Are you looking for a catalog of Letraset's digital fonts or something
    earlier - such as a rub-on catalog? I have a 2002-dated Fontek .pdf in a FILE
    labeled \"complete Letraset fonts\". It has three pages of short embedded font
    samples (the font names, mostly) and 50 pages of full font samples (all as outlines)\r\n\r\n

  body: "Herb: It was a digital version of the transfer sheet catalogue that I was
    really after. I have a hard copy, but I thought it would also be beneficial to
    have a scanned version as well.\r\n\r\nIt can be a very useful reference point.
    For instance, I discovered during one 'hunt', that a font named PALANA by Alan
    Withers, has never (to my knowledge) been digitised, plus there are some subtle
    differences in other cuts as well.... Typophile gold !!!\r\n\r\nAnyway, it needs
    to be done before I spill coffee all over it, or in my old age, involuntary dribbling
    starts occurring  ;-)\r\n\r\nAdrian\r\n\r\n"

  body: I have a copy or two of the Letraset catalog from the mid to late '80s somewhere
    in my archives. One day I'll dig it out. I think there's a Chartpak catalog in
    there too.

  body: Anything ever come from this discussion? I'd love to see both the Letraset
    catalog and the Chartpak catalog online. But my Apple ColorOne Scanner is almost
    as old as the catalogs themselves.
