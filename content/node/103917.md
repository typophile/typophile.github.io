  close (Deltarbo, Woodgrit, Folio EF), but nothing that is a match. \r\n\r\nDisregard
  the lines within the letters (EX. \"k\", \"o\") as that was due to the machining
  of the letters by a rotary engraver.\r\n \r\nAny help is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/borderpic_5816.jpg]"

    Grotesk</a> comes close, but your G is a bit more rounded. Could that be the result
    of the engraving?
