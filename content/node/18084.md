body: Can anyone identify this font? It's from George Romero's "Martin", unfortunately,
  it's not the logo that's widely used, so, finding a decent image was hard. I've
  included two samples, a large one, but the top of the T and N are cut off, and a
  small one, the small one is kind of hard to see, but it gets the point across.
