  link to see the awesome serif used for the logo. It's the first thing that comes
  up on the top right corner.\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.nextmodels.com\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help identifying
  the typeface would be much appreciated."

    can see the typeface better at the NextModels website but here's a picture of
    it too.\r\n\r\nI've been looking around for it still but I can only find similar
    typefaces like Perpetua Tilting or Felix Tilting. They're all close but not as
    skinny as the serif in the picture."

  body: "Hey I FINALLY found out what font it is. Apparently it's a custom font by
    Paris-based M/M.  I figured it out when I saw the same font again in French Vogue,
    they use it for subject heads in their magazine.  Seeing as how NEXT uses it also,
    I'm guessing it's not an exclusive font. But I have no idea if they're licensing
    it out at their website because it's pretty confusing. If any of you find out
    let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help."
