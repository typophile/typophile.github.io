body: 'I&#39;ve wondered for a long time what font what used <BR>to set the body text
  of Gregory Maguire&#39;s novel, <BR>&#34;Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked
  Witch <BR>of the West&#34;, designed by Joel Avirom and Jason Snyder. <BR> <BR>It
  almost looks like it could be something by Weiss, <BR>Menhart or Post, but I haven&#39;t
  been able to pin <BR>it down yet. <BR> <BR>Whatever it is, it&#39;s an unusual yet
  oddly readable <BR>beauty. Note the distinctive upper-case C, G, S, E <BR>and Q,
  and lower-case venetian e, and distinctive <BR>c, g, and s, among other characters.
  <BR> <BR>Any ideas? Apologies for the large size <BR>of the scan, but I wanted to
  post as good <BR>a sample as possible, considering the only copy <BR>of the book
  I have available is a trade paperback <BR>printed on slightly glorified newsprint.

  body: I thought that upper-case &#34;W&#34; looked kinda Goudyish. <BR>So much for
    Weiss, Menhart and Post. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
