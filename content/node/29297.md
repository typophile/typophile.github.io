  font which i cannot identify.  If anyone happens to know what font(s) are in use
  on the attached label, the info would be greatly appreciated.  Incase it is not
  all easy to make out, i'm looking for the font(s) used on the Dewar's scotch whisky
  white label.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "This looks like it has evolved from the Victorian/Edwardian version - which
    would probably be hand drawn, or certainly very adapted from a font, which I will
    have a look through my old founder's books for when I get a mo. \r\n\r\nPossibly
    an inspiration for Belwe, though I've no idea if he partook.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dewarswow.com/flash_timeline/timeline.aspx?SectionId=1899\">Dewar's</a>
    \r\n\r\nVery likely a long way from an actual font - although quite Belwe'esque
    if you squint."
