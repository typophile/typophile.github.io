  be a type of Helvetica but I'm not sure. Initially I thought it might be Helvetica
  Medium Condensed Regular but this is quite a bit narrower than that and it appears
  to be a little taller as well. You can't tell here but the bottom right corner of
  the 'R' does not protude outwards. Please be as specific as possible. Thanks."

    with absolute certainty. It very well could be Helvetica (or one of it''s many
    clones) and someone could have very easily manually condensed horizontally or
    stretched it vertically it in software like Adobe Illustrator before sending it
    off to be embroidered. My guess is that the "R" does protrude outwards but the
    white portions of the fabric hide that fact. '

    in thread is a fool\u2019s errand, but here goes....\r\n\r\nIf by \u201Cthe bottom
    right corner of the 'R' does not protude outwards\u201D you mean that the leg
    of the |R| ends perpendicular to the baseline, not with a little curve, that may
    just have been too fine a detail for the production method to reproduce. It is
    exceedingly rare to find that type of curved-leg |R| in a sans serif without that
    detail.\r\n\r\nHelvetica Neue 77 Cond Bold should do the trick:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/\r\n\r\nPragmatica
    Condensed Bold is also an option:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/pragmatica/\r\n\r\nAlso
    amusing to get this in response to my visual search using your sample:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=Diffuse-&text=THEANSWER"
