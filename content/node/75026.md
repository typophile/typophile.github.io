  used for headlines in swedish Bon Magazine.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6588.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4388.png]\r\n\r\nIt
  looks a bit like Neuzeit, as well as a Drescher Grotesk, but it's not quite there.\r\nI'm
  sorry about the horrid picture quality, I'll try to pick up a copy and get some
  scans asap.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n-s"
