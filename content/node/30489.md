  days of MSWord, I used to love its tiny size and ease of use--after all, it fit
  on a 400k floppy disk along with my System folder with Excel and MacDraw! In recent
  years, it has become so bloated and sluggish that I can't stand the thought of launching
  it and waiting forever for the behemoth to finally load (that little \"help\" paperclip
  thing needs to be shot too). I have come to use a tiny little text editor for almost
  all my word-processing. It is fast, clean, and totally bug free!\r\nNow for the
  other shoe--\r\nA couple of years ago, I started designing typefaces and began using
  FontLab. The current version has a nice little feature under the \"Quick Test as
  OTF\" menu which allows you to get a text dump of all the glyphs in the font you
  are working on. What a great way to test fonts! The catch is, things like smallcaps
  cogonek show up as \"Undefined\" squares when I paste the text into my trusty text
  editor or even into InD. Even changing the font to something all encompassing like
  Garamond Premier Pro won't fix it! Damn!\r\nHere Word Comes to Save the Day!\r\nThe
  other day, I had accidentally opened the dreaded MSWord instead of my little text
  editor. I got a phone call then so I let the overgrown monster launch while I took
  the call. Since I had the thing open already, I just pasted the character set text
  from FontLab into the blank Word file. SHAZZZAAAAM!!! The whole thing pasted! Most
  of it as Lucida Grande but the smallcaps diacritics and supnums pasted as Big Caslon!
  Word chose a font from my system which recognized each glyph. If one font didn't
  have a glyph, it switched to another on the fly! I then placed the Word file into
  InD and I was in business!!!\r\nGod, it hurts me to say this but, MS Word I love
  you!\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n"

    that asks \"Which data you want to use while generating OpenType font?\" does
    it make a difference whether you chose Compiled or Binary?\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    \"All Characters\" from the little pop-up menu. You can also pick any code page
