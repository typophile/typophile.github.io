  Their only direction was that they wanted to see a few concepts with \"AMF\".\r\n\r\nThis
  is the main concept I'm presenting:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/aft/aft_logo_072009/concept_1.html\r\n\r\nI
  think this is my strongest concept. It fits the AMF requirement and also incorporates
  a symbol for \"-\" and \"+\" representing the futures market/stocks/numbers/etc...\r\n\r\nI
  like these as well:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/aft/aft_logo_072009/concept_2.html\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/aft/aft_logo_072009/concept_3.html\r\n\r\nLet
  me know what <em>you</em> think.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

  body: "The first is the strongest. But having the red dash (line) so far away from
    the rest of the + it reads as -HAFT first.\r\n\r\nA word of warning. Google loves
    Typophile. So if your client would prefer you not discuss them online you should
    edit the title of this thread and promote the use of just AMF. (Unless even AMF
    is part of their brand.)"

  body: "I also read it as -HAFT, and I think the plus sign, mixed with the green-blue
    colour, gives the logo a medicinal feel\r\n\r\nAlso is it me or is the horizontal
    bar on the plus sign a little too low?"

  body: "+1 for \u201CHAFT\u201D. Perhaps make the plus sign a bit smaller than the
    letters and center it vertically, then bump it a few ticks to the left?"

  body: "The plus sign also seems wider than it is tall and I feel compelled to make
    it square.\r\n\r\n[edit] I should add that I like the direction of the first one.
    I didn't mean to sound all negative!"

  body: Same here, i like the first project but i also read Haft. I agreed with Ed_Aranda,
    you should try to make the + sign smaller or more detached from the A, so it doesn't
    look like a cutted H.
