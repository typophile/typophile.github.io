  body: I&#39;d venture to say it&#39;s hand lettered, but <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=60&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Pirate+Ban&amp;advanced=1&amp;params%5Bsearchtype%5D=normal&amp;params%5Bboolean%5D=and&amp;search%5Btext%5D=lhf+monogram">LHF
    Monogram English</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/classic/carol/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=72&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Pirate+Ban">Carol</a>

  body: I am agree with David, it&#39;s from a BT tracker website, not a design one.
