    to use.\r\nThe textures should be such that will be of some use for blind as well.there
    has to be reason and logic behind every texture.\r\nCant decide what textures
    to use in my calendar."

  body: This could be interesting. For example, think about each month as represented
    seasonally. For Spring months, such as March and April, could be represented with
    the feeling of grass, or dew drops. Summer months might be sandy and warm, while
    winter might feel like cold steel.
