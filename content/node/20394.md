  body: "Well, this looks like one of those myriads of free-fonts to me. Apologies
    if it isn't. \r\nHaven't found an exact match. But if I would have to redo the
    logo I'd started with various weights of <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=karnivore&page=1&nb_ppp_old=50&text=FITNESS+CONCEPT&nb_ppp=50&af=on&classt=alpha\">Karnivore</a>

    Bold. It used to be available at fontomas.com in 2003 - but i can't find it on
    the web anywhere...\r\n\r\nmaybe you can email them?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blockit_5149.png]\r\n\r\n(edit:
    after a little research i found out that you can purchase a CD containing all
