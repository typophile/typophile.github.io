  interested in this sort of thing anyway.. I just wanted to mention that i was recently
  able to get ahold of the reprinted and seemingly not-so-easy-to-get-ahold-of <a
  href=\"http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=P0125\">Saul Bass and Associates
  book</a> (originally from 1979). i found it online at a specialized bookstore in
  Holland called <a href=\"http://www.nijhoflee.nl/bookstore/\">Nijhof & Lee</a> and
  it costs for \u20AC36 + shipping, which wasn't too bad. it's certainly no definitive
  book on all things Saul Bass, but given the slim-to-none existence of Saul Bass
  books in general, it's worth having if you're a fan like myself.\r\n\r\n(the first
  link has some samples from the book)"

    one of the few Saul Bass websites around.. a shame that the saulbass.net site
    just disappeared.\r\n\r\nwent to the Saul Bass exhibit in London in 2004, which
    was completely awesome. not only did it have all the goodies, but they had sketches,
    private letters and such.. i wish i'd taken a camera."

  body: Just placed the order.  Thanks for the link!  There should be a DVD of all
    his title sequences.  Now all I need is an exhaustive book on Ronald Clyne and
    my cypher will be complete.

      \"Bass on Titles\". though it only contains 10 title sequences, not all of them.
      it's pretty hard to find (i haven't had any luck yet), but i do know it's available
      on a shorts compilation in North America called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000055WG3/ref=sr_11_1/102-9167898-1822537?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=130\">\"Short
      11: Ecstasy\"</a>. no idea of the quality on that one though (the stand-alone
      release in the UK is supposed to have been digitally remastered)."

        \ Excellent book, and for all you folks stateside that are alarmed by the
        shipping rates, I chose economy (that said 4-6 weeks) and it arrived in 7
        days.\r\n\r\nAlso to reply on my own comment about a Ronald Clyne book--the
        man just passed 3 weeks ago.  r.i.p."

    think the reviewer on Amazon it sums it up in terms of price/duration/quality/aspect
    ratio issues (prepare for a lot of fiddling with the zoom button); I'm pretty
    sure it wasn't remastered. I'd just come back from the Design Museum show and
    didn't notice the production date on the DVD so mistakenly assumed it was the
    same comprehensive showreel I'd just seen there, so was rather disapointed! Luckily
    I'd only hired it.\r\n"
