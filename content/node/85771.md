    the UN Declaration of Human Rights addresses the issue:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Article
    23.\r\n(2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for
    equal work.\r\n(3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration\u2026</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBy
    entering the competition, one declines the right.\r\n\"Noble Spec\": the end justifies
    the means.\r\n\r\n"

    But you can't come out and say that, so you have to\r\npost-rationalize some bunk
    and pull the wool over people's eyes.\r\nLuckily, being unduly affluent no matter
    how much it hurts the\r\nplanet and your fellow humans is not a human right.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I don't know that this would even be defined as \"on-spec\" work.  It appears
    to be more pro bono donation to me.  I see this as no different than what many
    of us here have done with the several FontAid projects. There is no speculation
    because there is no pay off other than acknowledgment and a bit of brief notoriety.
    To me, it is a straight donation for a cause the contributors believe in.\r\n\r\nI
    don't want any organization defining for me what is charity.  I know what it is
    for me and don't think anyone has the right to redefine it for anyone else."

  body: "It may be a noble cause, and the people involved may have good intentions,
    but it would have been far better if the committee had just chosen a well-respected
    design firm and asked if they'd be willing to design a logo for free. Many design
    firms do pro bono work routinely for good causes. And if the committee didn't
    like their design, they could ask another firm to take a try at it. \r\n\r\nBut
    this \"cattle call\" approach to design is a bad way to go for numerous reasons,
    and is virtually unheard of in most other professions."

  body: I agree with JamesM.  I'm surprised designers as renowned as Tina Roth Eisenberg
    and Erik Spiekermann were on the panel of a "design competition."  Also, the winning
    logo is totally meh.

  body: "Chris, I might counter that not paying the winner makes it <em>worse</em>
    in the eyes of many people opposed to spec work.\r\n\r\nJames, I think the nature
    of this project would have made the awarding of the work to a hand-picked design
    firm (paid or not) anathema. This is a special case where it actually makes more
    sense to let anybody try his hand, and let people vote on it. I will remind you
    that I am in no way a fan of Democracy...  :-)\r\n\r\nTrevor, I think the winning
    logo is much better than most paid logos.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Not that it has any bearing on the issue of pro bono vs spec, but I also
    believe honestly that it is a quite GOOD logo (symbol sign, brand, what have you).
    It is certainly far better than the redos of, Quark, The Gap, UPS, and dozens
    more big-bucks gradient emblazoned bandanas that have been paid for by for profit
    businesses.\r\n\r\nSpec work is work done almost under coercion with empty promises
    of future business and \"making a name for oneself. It is the bait and switch
    shell game of con men who feel proud of themselves for squeezing free work out
    of work-hungry designers with bills to pay and then go off laughing about the
    suckers they have screwed over in their career.\r\n\r\nPro bono, or volunteer
    work for charities is someone giving freely of their time and skills with no expectation
    of renumeration.  The difference can only be honestly determined by the parties
    involved. "
