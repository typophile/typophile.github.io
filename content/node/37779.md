  body: Thank you. I would say that there are about 5 or 6 Typophiles who can ID 9/10
    cases on this board without (hardly) moving their mouse! Even so, that does leave
    a lot of the less popular type for myself and other enthusiasts. So keep up the
    good work Brett... you may not get thanks very often but I appreciate your input
    on these boards.
