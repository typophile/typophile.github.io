    and typesetting. The early types (Jenson et al) were exact adaptations of the
    Renaissance humanist calligraphy, and the oblique cross bar, which also extends
    out of the letter shape, looks exactly like what it is then: a pen / feather stroke,
    which naturally comes all the way up, following the movement of the hand. When
    Garamont and his fellows took over the engraving of following types, they kept
    the overall look of the letters but modified them in order to bring more harmony,
    structural strength and aesthetic improvements: they basically transformed a calligraphy
    into a typography. That transition was not as obvious as the one done by Grandjean,
    Caslon and Baskerville some years later, but it is what I think the correct answer
    to your question.\r\n\r\nDavid R"

  body: "David\r\nMany thanks for your detailed response. It's obliqueness made sense
    to me; it was the sudden transition that I couldn't fathom. However, what you
    say about moving away from simply mimicking the Humanist hand is most interesting;
    and the <desire>desire</em> to to distance themselves from calligraphy.\r\n\r\nThe
    history of type from the beginning of the 16th century looks like typography getting
    into gear, and becoming that much more self-assured. I guess we can observe a
    similar phenomenon in the nascent days of any new technology; at first, the technology
    is used simply as a labour-saving device, doing pretty much the same task, only
    faster, more efficiently; then as it begins to mature it finds new and unique
    ways of expressing itself.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your help on this one, David.\r\n\r\njohno

    a sense of humanity in their designs (especially kabel, which i tend to hate because

    in presence in Jenson's printed image, but it seems reasonable that he was quite
    taken with the idea of making the fit of his letters look like they were a close-fitting
    puzzle that had been slightly \"exploded\", and the stud looks like it locks against
    the n in particular.\r\nRedesigners have generally incorporated the stud, because
    it's a signature device, and people expect it.\r\nSo Benton's close revival (Cloister,
    1913) makes it quite prominent.\r\nRogers' Centaur (1914) has it very subtly,
    as does Frere-Jones' Hightower (1994).\r\nSlimbach makes it a feature of Adobe
    Jenson(1996), and I have it in Goodchild (2003) and Nicholas, but quite small.
    \r\nThe stud is definitely a Jenson thang -- other neo-Venetians, eg Benedictine
    (1915) and Slimbach's Giovanni (1989) don't have it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jenson_3564.jpg]\r\nJenson\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jenson2_3735.jpg]\r\nKennerley\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jenson3_3597.jpg]\r\nCloister"

    I will say that's a narrow view of Kabel and of <strong>e</strong> topology. Kabel
    is one of the great underappreciated linear type designs. Unconventional yes,

    to challenge what we might call the \"tyranny of mainstream values\".\r\n\r\nForget
    about the calligraphic origin of <strong>e</strong>'s with oblique crossbars for
    a moment. Type designers can include the structure for other reasons having nothing
    to do with calligraphy. The angle of such a bar harmonizes nicely with the branching
    angle of strokes attached to the stems of h, n, m and u, and harmonizes with angled
    stem ends (if present).\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    can only enrich itself from the unconventional types being designed here and there,
    if the designer has some basic typographic skills, and Rudolf Koch undoubtedly
    had some. \r\n\r\nThis being said, it is up to each and every one's taste, at
    the end, to determine whether you like a font or not. Though I recognize and respect
    Kabel as an important font in type history, I have to say that I cringe every
    time I see it, I just don't like it, as I don't like Avant-garde or Souvenir.
    \r\n\r\nAt last, you tell me that my explanation of the Kabel's venetian e is
    a 'narrow view'. well, take a closer look at Kabel: large ascenders to x-height
    ratio, traditional roman shape for the lower case a, tail to the t, this venetian
    e, oblique endings to many of the strokes... i can't find right now any quotes
    from koch himself, but there is no serious question\u0131ng about the fact that
    he deliberately tried to put calligraphic features in Kabel. let me take a copy
    of 'anatomy of a typeface' by lawson: ''as koch was in every sense a traditional
    designer - who had cut many of the punches of his earlier types by hand - he evidently
    found it more difficult than did Renner to depart from the normal roman forms''.\r\n\r\ndavid

    good way is to ask what the purpose of the design is. Then you can ask well it
    fulfills that purpose. That purpose might be practical, like a readable road sign,
    or emotional, like conveying a happy mood or conveying authority. \r\n\r\nAnother
    way is to try to separate style from how well a design is realized. For example,
    some people's taste is for simple designs and some more ornate. But even if you
    don't prefer a style you can see better and worse executions of it. It is also
    helpful to compare with designs of the same style or stylistic idea--such as humanist
    slab serifs or something like that.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, even after this there is
    a big element of what moves you aesthetically. And this is very hard to get any

    and how this is improved by lowering the beak and, in the process, making the
    bar horizontal, has a lot of merit. That sounds to me like the way a type designer
    thinks about these things. The notion that the bar was made horizontal to 'mark
    the transition between calligraphy and typesetting' doesn't make sense to me.
    One can say that the horizontal bar became a mark of the typographic letter, which
    is a straight observation, but I don't think Griffo was sitting there thinking
    'How can I make my type more typographic?' What would that question even mean
    at that stage in the development of typography? I find it much more likely that,
    through looking closely at letters, particularly at the sizes at which he was
    beginning to cut type, he noted how certain relationships could be made less cluttered.
