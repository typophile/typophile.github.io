  body: I was recently looking for something similar; a serif typeface to match DIN
    Engschrift logo text as part of an identity package. I've been playing with Prensa,
    but I haven't completely settled on it. It offers an interesting pairing and it's
    an extremely well constructed, but it, like Caecilia that Mr. Coles suggested,
    is perhaps bit too jaunty for my use.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback! I'm also working on an identity project. I've been
    trying to decide between Utopia and Scala, but am leaning towards Scala. I like
    Prensa as well, but maybe Scala is a little more serious. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
