  have a word in portuguese for these special stores, that sell old and used books:
  alfarrabista. Does English have a special word for this?Other them second-hand bookseller
  or antiquarian?\r\n\r\nI found some old pages from a catalogue with some typefaces
  and ornaments. I made a digitalisation of some to share with the \"commutity\"...\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio
  Fonseca\r\n\r\nPS- As soon as I get more free time I will digitalise the rest...\r\n\r\n"
