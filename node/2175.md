body: 0-9, printed on the flap of a certain kind of Russian envelop. 18pts or so from
  the bottom of a numeral to its top. While I&#39;m sure it&#39;s some sort of in-house
  identification system &#40;I&#39;ve received several letters from Russia and all
  have had these marks&#41; I can&#39;t find anything on it. I&#39;m thinking of expanding
  it into a typeface but would like to know if something similar already exists. Anyone
  know what this is, or seen anything like it? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21036.gif"

  body: This is the russian equivalent of the zip code/postal code. The standard envelopes
    &#40;from the former USSR&#41; came printed with the template of those faint dots
    on the front of the envelope where you would write the zip code numbers, based
    on the way shown in the example you posted &#40;this was printed on the back flap
    of the envelope as instructions on writing the numerals&#41;. I&#39;m not sure
    if there was a system of OCR in the Russian postal system, but this sure looks
    like an attempt at one.  <BR> <BR>There are similar typefaces that are based on
    a grid, mainly they&#39;re based on the way old Liquid Crystal Dispays in calculators
    were designed. But those had an extra 2 diagonals in the grid.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not sure there is a typeface based on this exact grid system. You might search
    <a href="http://www.paratype.ru" target="_blank">Paratype foundry</a> for something
    similar.

  body: Thanks guys. Nothing at 2rebels. Nice site though. Paratype seems to be out
    of sorts, lots of server errors. On a tip from elsewhere though, I&#39;ve found
    the face, named <i>ZIPcode</i>, located <a href="http://fonts.gets.ru">here</a>.
    I&#39;ve had no luck unstuffing the file. So close, oh well. Thanks again.

    appear to be what you seek, though. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21067.gif"

  body: Oh, and there is a connecting top bar in the font, <BR>although it would have
    to be kerned tighter than <BR> as-is to actually join up.
