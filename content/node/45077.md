body: "I'm making a manual for a computer game called Portal and I'm using images
  from the trailer for the game to keep it as authentic as possible.\r\n\r\nI have
  a problem though.  I'm using the intro image from the trailer[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cover_5468.jpg]
  and am changing the word \"video\" to the word \"Manual\"[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01-cover-sm_4894.jpg]The
  problem is that I can't seem to get the typeface right and I'm having a hard time
  finding out what the original typeface it.\r\n\r\nI don't work for valve, but I
  do have permission to make this manual and use their images.  Beyond that I am on
  my own.  Can someone help me get this typeface right because this is really bugging
  me."

    games I have played in quite some time. :)
