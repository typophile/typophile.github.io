body: "Hi everyone :)\r\n\r\nFor my Design course I am writing a research paper on
  the bad quality of high school subject briefs (you know those horribly designed
  course and topic outlines teachers would hand out) and going to improve them myself.
  (I partly chose this topic because I'm going to be a high school teacher myself
  once I graduate and who knows? It might make a difference!)\r\n\r\nWhat I'll be
  looking into is typography, composition and students' reaction to the good and bad
  designed versions (ie. does their presentation improve with better design [as students
  usually lead by example], do they feel more inclined to read the sheet of paper
  if it's better designed - does it communicate better etc)\r\n\r\nWhile I was thinking
  about how I could go through the process of testing students response, I was remembered
  that students in this generation prefer information handed to them on screen ...
  so I am looking into typefaces and sizes that are good for reading on screen.\r\n\r\nWhat
  typefaces can you recommend - for screen or print?\r\n\r\nAnd with this, what sans
  serif and serif fonts go well together when presenting information for teenage students?\r\n\r\nIf
  you can recommend your choices - and with any websites/sources that I could get
  some information from I would really, really appreciate it! \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSamantha"

  body: "A most interesting topic. It is definitely something that should be looked
    at because presentation of information on any medium matters when it is aimed
    at children and teenagers. Especially teenagers when they are developing there
    own sense of aesthetics, which in most cases would be pop. Children are easier
    to cater for because anything cute and eye catching are sufficient typographic
    criteria.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion teenagers of today are bored with sans serif fonts
    because of its generic use in news papers, text books and other publications.
    If there briefs or course descriptions were written in a serif, it would engage
    there attention because of its modern feel.\r\n\r\nAnd if these information systems
    are designed in an engaging way, students who do not listen to their teachers
    would be more inclined to read it themselves.\r\n\r\nIt would be very intriguing
    to do a survey to a group of high school kids of which type fonts they find interesting
    or engaging.\r\n\r\nGood Luck \r\nQueenSammy "

  body: As a fellow new teacher, I've found that high school students are skeptical
    of overly designed stuff as it looks to be pulled from some pre-constructed curriculum.
    Authenticity is big with teenagers, and I like to use my design to signal to them
    that everything they are reading is either from a non-endemic source (something
    not designed for classrooms) or made by me.

  body: "Hi Samantha, what a well deserving topic for research! I hope more teachers
    follow suit and start to more intentionally design their briefs to be more engaging
    to their students. I have a few clarifying questions and a couple of suggestions.
    One, what is your main objective with your research? Assuming that your project
    is perhaps not as stringent as a formal research experiment with independent and
    dependent variables, you would still likely benefit from some focus. For example,
    if you limit your measurement to the students' levels of engagement, you can define
    what that means. You would also likely do well to define the qualities of poorly
    designed briefs as well as contrast those with good qualities of your brief. \r\n\r\nThat
    then brings us to your question of what typefaces to choose. Pivoting a little
    from what Daniel mentioned above, you'd do well to survey some high school students
    and ask them what sites they visit for their news or other important time-sensitive
    information and get them to tell you how \"trusted\" and \"engaging\" those sources
    are. If you already have a group of students that you are using for your test
    of briefs you could use the same group to survey ahead of time. The smaller the
    sample size the less general the results can be applied, but they'll likely be
    very applicable to that group, and would show merit for further research. From
    there, you can get a feel for what typefaces they are likely to pay attention
    to. You may or may not want to include other typographic variables such as alignment,
    spacing, and hierarchy as each of these influence the overall design but also
    require measurement if they are to be different between the good and bad brief
    samples. Otherwise, focusing exclusively on typefaces may be a more manageable
    project.\r\n\r\nWish you the best of luck!"

  body: "When I was out of school and enthusiastic about writing a thesis and getting
    my degree I read a lot about legibility. At first I thought legibility was all
    about a great typeface and superb typesetting. What I learned is that as with
    any perceptual process reading is a guessing game and the more interest, context
    and familiarity with the topic, the easiest reading will be as long as the typeface
    or typesetting is not too bad.\r\n\r\nApart from recommending good screen fonts
    I would emphasize the importance of highlighting a lot of smaller but relevant
    information chunks (quotes, numeralia, short facts) that raise interest and give
    context before starting the reading. A couple of other good legibility practices
    (if you are not presenting long prose) are presenting the text in many smaller
    sections with descriptive titles and\r\n\r\nFor screen legibility Open Sans or
    Merryweather are great choices. You can see many typeface pairings here:\r\n\r\nhttp://fontpair.co/\r\n\r\nDon't
    be shy with typeface size on screen, most fonts will read well above 17 point
    size."
