		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like some of the Mac Rhino faces, but this one appears to me quite awkward. To some others this might be nicely innovative, but for me, the rounds are too light compared to the verticals, resulting in a disturbingly uneven color. Also for me the serifs appear to be snapped on backwards. A traditional pen-influenced way (from Jenson on) is to have the left a thicker wedge and the right a thinner, longer horizontal. To me this makes visual sense, giving a sense of motion in the direction of reading. The other way around kind of feels to me like bumps in the road.</p>
<p>I guess I should be an equal opportunity critic and say that I detested Super Duty. No problems with the crafting of the shapes, but I just took an antipathy to the brutal look and some difficult-to-read characters&hellip;</p>

<p>This explains a great deal. I kept wondering why Beorcana looked so different on Typophile - and that was the reason I most suspected. And Zara is of course 100% correct about rendering being a significant factor.</p>
<p>Bill, I agree with you that these is something about it that is surprising. I think part of it is the unusual details at the end of the top &lsquo;arm&rsquo;* of the &lsquo;a&rsquo;. The cuts at the joins are not as extreme as I would like when it&rsquo;s used at smallers sizes.</p>
<p>But the thing I like about it is the flavor of it. It&rsquo;s got a clunky but likeable voice.</p>
<p>When you look closely at the serifs I think you find about half the reason for that voice.  They are really weird. Weirder than I would expect you could get away with.</p>
<p>But there is something to that uneveness thing you brought up too. When you look at the o &amp; u next to each other they don&rsquo;t match in the way you would expect. The feeling get from this - too naively I admit -  is of uneven letter press. Perhaps that was the intent. To create something that slips an association of the coloful &amp; antique past you - but in a new way. Of course maybe I am reading too much into it.</p>
<p>I would prefer to set a menu or an information piece about a Hotel or a Magazine article in this font than a book. This isn&rsquo;t a ding or a negative - just my sense of what it&rsquo;s most suited to. I can say that about plenty of faces I respect - like Sanuk &amp; Amalia for instance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually I have forgotten if I ever knew - what is that part called anyway?</li>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, looking again, I think what is most causing what is for me an unbalanced look is the disparity in the treatment of top horizontal arches. The treatment of the arches on the hmn is much heavier than in the acdso, for example. It is not just that the biggest and smallest places are different, but also that so much weight is carried from the right stems on the mnh so far into the join with the left stems. Stefan has other fonts that are well balanced, so these things were deliberate decisions. But for me they break the boundaries of what the eye is comfortable reading.</div>
