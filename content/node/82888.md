  Reading and St Bride Library, London.\r\n\r\nThe Typeface Designs of Eric Gill\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARTING
  OCTOBER 2011\r\n\r\nAn AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award studentship (fully funded
  fees and maintenance) between the University of Reading and St Bride Library, London
  is available to a suitably qualified UK or EU student.\r\n\r\nThe period in which
  Eric Gill's typefaces were first manufactured was the golden age of hot metal typesetting
  and Gill himself is arguably the most important British typeface designer of the
  twentieth century. However, as an artist he did not have the necessary technical
  knowledge of type production and so craftsmen and engineers also played a role in
  manufacturing Gill's typefaces. This research will document the complete body of
  Gill's work as a typeface designer for the first time; explain the role he played
  in the conception and manufacture of each of his designs; evaluate the impact of
  hot-metal typesetting technology on Gill's typefaces and investigate the extent
  to which this was carried forward into subsequent versions which were produced for
  photocomposition and digital typesetting.\r\n\r\nIn addition to extensive archival
  research at St Bride Library this doctoral research will draw on the archives of
  the Monotype Corporation Type Drawing Office held by Monotype Imaging, and of Ditchling
  Museum.\r\n\r\nSupervision will be by Dr Rob Banham and Professor Paul Luna in Reading,
  and Mr Nigel Roche at St Bride Library. The successful candidate will be expected
  to spend extended periods of research time at St Bride Library, for which travel
  expenses from Reading will be provided.\r\n\r\nApart from the normal criteria for
  the selection of research students, specific criteria for selection for this studentship
  are\r\n\r\n- suitability for archival research\r\n\r\n- first degree/MA ideally
  in an aspect of design practice or design history, or a related field such as history
  of art or history of technology\r\n\r\nInformal enquiries should be addressed to
  Dr Rob Banham: r.e.banham@reading.ac.uk\r\n\r\nApplication forms can be obtained
  from c.davidson@reading.ac.uk, and should be accompanied by a CV and a relevant
  example of writing.\r\n\r\nClosing date for applications: 24 June 2011\r\n\r\nInterviews
  are likely to be held at St Bride Library on 14 July 2011\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLink

    Gill's typefaces.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's a bit of a non sequitur.\r\n\r\nThe industrial
    structure employed by the large foundries was predicated on division of labor,
    so no one involved, artist or otherwise, could play all the roles themselves\u2014except
    perhaps Morris Benton, who was a qualified engineer and owned the company! But
    even he delegated extensively, given the large number of typefaces he was responsible
    for designing.\r\n\r\nGoudy and Koch (an artist if ever there was one) balked
    at being shut out, and through force of personality were able to go deeper into
    the manufacturing process, eventually doing their own punch cutting\u2014a retro
    rebuttal of the high-tech manufacturing process that Benton did not pursue. One
    would have expected the uncompromising Gill, handy man with a chisel that he was,
    to be a punch-cutter too.\r\n\r\nIt will be fascinating for this research to address
    the creative tension between Gill and the type industry of the day.\r\n\r\nThe
    same issues of authorship and division of labour exist now, as no doubt they always
    have and will.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"The same issues of authorship and division of labour exist now, as no doubt
    they always have and will.\"\r\n\r\nYes, they still do, but today, it is far,
    far easier to \"go it alone\" than ever before.  A typeface is no-longer tied
    to either a typesetting machine or company or country or even continent.  The
    number of egos to get bruised is much smaller (fewer suits in the mix), the knowledge
    needed is achievable for the willing, and the effects of market failure are quite
    minimal compared to either metal or photo composition. \r\n\r\nTo me the greater
    comparison, is to any industry which leaped past the manufacturing and distribution
    hurdles of 20th century and before to an era where \"the product\" is some sort
    of unseen encoded mathematical description of what will eventually be seen by
    the user.\r\n\r\nGreat topic, Gerry! Can't wait for the book and movie!"
