body: The apostrophe, when used for a person's year of graduation, should have it's
  "eye" on top and tail on the bottom. In InDesign, whenever I type the apostrophe,
  it comes out the opposite way, with the eye below and the tail on top. Any idea
  how to correct that?

  body: 'In such situations I find it quickest to type a character, the apostrophe,
    then delete the character. I''ve tried to memorize the keyboard sequence to get
    it, but in the moments it takes me to recall it (since I don''t encounter this
    too often), I can use my hack more quickly. I do have a written list taped to
    the wall, but again, it takes longer to scan the list. '

  body: "Correct me if I'm wrong, but to be technically correct, isn't <cite>option+shift+]</cite>
    the key combo for a single close quote? Given, a single close quote and an apostrophe
    often have identical designs, but I was under the impression that there were separate
    spots within a font for each character.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand this distinction
    is a little more crucial in the context of web typography, as many screen readers
    for the visually impaired read the characters semantically, not visually."

  body: "You're correct, Nick, that key combination is for the single closing quote.
    But in Fontographer, at least, that character is only drawn once and serves as
    both closing single quote and apostrophe (the \"smart\" or \"curly\" kind, of
    course).\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'The "apostrophe" is designed as a vertical tick mark in most fonts and is
    replaced by a single close quote by the "smart quote" feature in most design software.
    It may be semantically correct to use the tick-mark apostrophe in some cases,
    but it is more typographically correct to use the single close quote. Typographically
    and historically, the two are identical in appearance. '
