  last summer, when Antonio and I were planning to start our gay Italian magazine.
  The idea is still there, but to test the waters we decided to start Tom as a weblog
  first. <BR>I&#39;m happy to say things are going quite well: more comments every
  day, a LOT of interest from the Italian gay community and this week one of the main
  Italian weekly magazines has a big feature on weblogs and Tom is among the very
  best TEN mentioned! :-&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.tom-online.it" target="_blank">www.tom-online.it</a>
  <BR> <BR>Unfortunately for the most of you our blog is in Italian, but what may
  be of interest is tha I am also doing my best to build Tom as a brand concept: check
  out the site for one of the very first public appearances of DTL Prokyon, of which
  I am a proud &#40;and much, much poorer!&#41; licence owners. I will follow this
  post with a couple of flyers for Tom that I had printed, whre I used Prokyon too.
  <BR>let me know what you think! <BR>Ciao a tutti.'
