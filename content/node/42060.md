  \r\n\r\nI think this is a great idea, though by no means do I think they will be
  able to generate fully-formed quality typefaces. They do seem like a great tool
  for generating consistent contrasts and making it possible to test a typeface's
  color at dozens of weights before committing to anything. \r\n\r\nHas anyone had
  the chance to try them out? I'm on CS3, so I haven't been able to try LivePen, and
  Kalliculator is yet to be released."

    or something like that.

  body: Good info, Tim. It sounds like LivePen is somewhat lacking, but what's your
    experience with Kalliculator? Thanks
