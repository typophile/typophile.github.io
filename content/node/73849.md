  body: "I think it is a customised Novarese\u2019s Augustea (see first answer in
    the older thread).\r\nUnfortunately that design is digitally available only in
    an inscribed version (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/augustea-open-sb/alternate_cuts.html).\r\nThe
    one Yves points to in the other thread is a completely unrelated design, which
    appears to bear the same name (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/augustea-bq/)."

    the clocks back to early nineties. I had been redoing some logos for clients,
    who had only crappy business cards...\r\nThanks Akira!"
