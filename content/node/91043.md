  to work on adding a graident. Since then I've dropped the gradient but for the life
  of me I cannot remember the font.\r\n\r\nI know the subheading is Code Bold - but
  it\u2019s the main title I'm struggling with.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me?!\r\n\r\nYou
  can see the logo here -> http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/express-tires-pneus-action-total-extra-needs-logo-124180/entries/63\r\n\r\nFingers
