body: Hello. <BR>This isn&#39;t exactly a typographic composition, but I didn&#39;t
  know where to put it, so here we go; <BR> <BR>I created a targeted portfolio for
  a job I wanted... Now it seems I will not be getting the job as I haven&#39;t even
  got a reply for approximately 2 weeks, but that&#39;s just the way life is I guess
  :-&#93; <BR> <BR>So, I&#39;m looking for comments as I didn&#39;t get any from her,
  just tell me if it&#39;s any good or if it&#39;s worthless... Or maybe a bit more
  indepth if you have the time. <BR> <BR>By the way, the text is in Swedish unfortanly,
  but the images are still there. You get to the portfolio from the last link on the
  first page. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.radarteam.se/annika/index.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.radarteam.se/annika/index.html</A>
  <BR> <BR>Thank you!

    it looks good. Maybe add a little bit of subtle movement, here and there. <BR>

    not what comes to  <BR>my mind when you say &#39;targeted portfolio.&#39;  <BR>&#40;With
    illustrations, packaging, print and type in  <BR>one setting.&#41; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    my feedback without knowing your  <BR>intent or the &#39;requirements&#39; of
    the job... good  <BR>luck with it. '

  body: ' oh yeah. it might sound odd... the portfolio was targeted at a certain employer,
    and she wanted a broad range of work... <BR> <BR>as for movement... maybe, but
    very subtle if any. '

    isn&#39;t necessarily cartesian. Just a gentle color gradation shift can do wonders.
