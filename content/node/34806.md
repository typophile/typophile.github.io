  aware that I have been in the publishing business since 1988 and have worked from
  the versions 1 to the latest available in the industry i.e. CS3.\r\n\r\nThe publishing
  industry seems to make a landmark with this release of CS3 bridging the gap between
  the CS3 print users as well as other media's (web and mobile). Truly would be talking
  more about Indesign which is my favourite (being a head of design) I really feel
  that Indesign CS3 has made a great and overide change of how we look at the publishing
  softwares which were mere boxes and lines in their initial stages.\r\n\r\nWill be
  adding more on Indesign CS3 as it is my first blog on Indesign CS3 and this is just
  an intro to the mastering INDESIGN CS3."
