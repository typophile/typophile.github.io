body: "I found these this evening, got a laugh out of them and just had to share:\r\n\r\n\r\nRoses
  are red\r\nViolets are blue\r\nI think you're neat\r\nLike Helvetica Neue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
  a pair:\r\n\r\nRoses are red,\r\nDaisies are white,\r\nI think you're neat,\r\nLike
  Helvetica Light.\r\n\r\nPardon my ignorance,\r\nI should have been coyer,\r\nAnd
  checked how to say,\r\nHelvetica Neue!\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think these has been submitted
  before, so my apologies if it was!\r\n\r\n(from here: <a href=\"http://fortheloveoftype.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-think-youre-neat-like-helvetica-neue.html\"
