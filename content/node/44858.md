body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am working on a Japanese show for a museum and I was
  hoping that a few of you might be able to offer up a few suggestions. I am getting
  ready to typeset the brochure and I need a beautiful, legible, serif typeface that
  includes the macron (A macron, is a diacritic \xAF placed over or under a vowel.)
  I need the o and the u to have this option. \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, most do not include
  them. Thank you in advance for your suggestions.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Any number of fonts have vowels with macrons above. I don't believe I've
    ever seen one with precomposed vowels with macrons below -- not even sure they
    are encoded in Unicode. R & L with macrons below, yes, for transliterated Devanagari
    (Latin Extended Additional), but not, I think, macrons below.\r\n\r\nSo your best
    bet is to pick an Adobe OpenType font, or one from a foundry that allows end-user
    modification, make up the combining macron below, then make up the vowel with
    the macron below. If I'm right & it isn't encoded in Unicode, don't give it a
    Unicode value, just write a ccmp feature so the vowel + combining macron below
    calls your character.\r\n\r\nThis only works with OpenType savvy applications
    programs like InDesign. If you are going to use a Type 1 font & typesetting program,
    make up the characters needed, & lie about their names -- for instance, put one
    set in the spot where vowels with umlauts (aka dieresis) normally go, and pick
    another accented vowel for the other -- the grave, maybe? To set them, you will
    have to type (e.g., set) the umlauted vowel etc. but using your special font.
    Further use (aside from printing) of the typeset file will not be possible without
    editing, because you've called the \"wrong\" character.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you
    will typeset very slowly, using the plain vowels and the regular macron character
    hand kerned (& lowered for the macron below)."

  body: "To be consistent with the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization|Hepburn
    romanization standard]], I would resist any suggestions to put the macron under
    the vowel. Sometimes it's done by adding an underline to those letters as a way
    of avoiding actual diacritical marks, but that is a typographical hack. Most fonts
    from the last 10 years have \u0101, \u014D, & \u016B. I imagine one would have
    to know what the show was before font recommendations could be made. \r\n"

  body: "You can also take a look at Warnock Pro (slighly more Palatino-esque) and,
    to name a sans, Myriad Pro. The magic word seems to be \"Pro\" ...\r\n\r\nIf you
    have or know someone who has any of the recent Adobe Creative Suites, you can
    check all of these out. They come with the package!"

  body: "A quick go-through gives me additional possibilities like Arno Pro, Bodoni/Didot
    (interestingly, my version of Bodoni includes \u0233, while Didot does not), Brioso
    Pro (not really a serif), Cambria, Adobe Caslon Pro, Century, Chaparral Pro, Constantia,
    Adobe Garamond Pro, Hoefler Text (albeit with an odd, semi-rounded macron that
    looks strange), Adobe Jenson Pro, Palatino, Trajan, etc.\r\n\r\nAs Theunis said,
    any Adobe Pro face should have at least the five basic vowels with macron above."
