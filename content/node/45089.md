  as my questions are so general, it couldn't return good answers.\r\n\r\nI am trying
  to create few fonts and see how it comes on a webpage. In this process, i have couple
  of questions... basic ones!!\r\n\r\n1. say I created fonts in a non-english language
  and used this font to develop a webpage. Now, when another person opens up this
  page, how will it be rendered on his machine? does he need to install this font?\r\n\r\n2.
  is there any association between a font and unicode characters? if yes, can you
  explain how are they related.\r\n\r\n3. Is my understanding correct here? Browsers
  don't need any font installed on local machine to render unicode fonts? is it correct?\r\n\r\nBy
  asking all these questions, i am trying to understand how this font gets rendered
  on local user's machine if used in a webpage to increase the usability of fonts.\r\n\r\nplease
  let me know. i may have asked wrong or a noob like questions but i hope it'd be
  fine.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance"

    for assigning character codes to each of the images (\"glyphs\"). Although this
    can be in any number of different encodings, typically they get Unicodes as well.
    The [[href=\"www.unicode.org|Unicode]] of each character is used by almost every,
    if not every, program to distinguish between characters. While it's perfectly
    possible to draw an 'A' character in your font and assign it the Unicode value
    for, say, '1' (U+0030), this will make your font unusable in all programs: everywhere
    the character '1' is drawn, the end user sees an 'A'...\r\n\r\n3. Why'd you think
    that? Browsers on common systems (Mac OS X and Windows) don't draw fonts themselves.
    They rely on the system and on the fonts installed on this system. It's quite
    rare to see a font unique to a browser. I think Safari on Windows may be an exception
    -- I heard it comes with its own default font, Lucida Grande.\r\nThe situation
    is slightly different for Linux boxes, because these do not have a dedicated font
    drawing module. (But I suspect every current KDE and Gnome distribution works
    the same as Windows/OS X. Why would one include a font drawing module if the system
    already provides one?)\r\n\r\nBack to 1. If your font is just for looks, it can
    safely be replaced by (almost) any system font the user has. The exception is,
    of course, if your font provides characters that <em>are</em> defined in the Unicode
    set, but are not available in the commonly distributed fonts. You might use a
    nice Cherokee font on your site, but if the user has no font at all with these
    characters, she can't see them."

  body: "Actually, a great deal depends on how you design your web page.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's to be all in a \"weird\" character set, one not commonly supported, you're
    in trouble...\r\nOn the other hand, if it's mainly Latin text, with <em>some</em>
    parts in your special font, you might be able to insert these as images.\r\n\r\nAnother
    option is to start by saying \"You will need this-and-this font to view the page\",
    and put it up for download. I guess a Windows TTF format is supported by the majority
    of OS systems -- Windows, of course, but also Mac OS X, as well as any FreeType
    based Linux browser."
