    the SF bay area.

  body: "Look up steel rule die makers in the yellow pages. If you send them and outline
    the will make a cutting die. Any letterpress printer can do the die cutting.\r\n\r\nI
    hope that is what you need."

  body: "You should try drawing up the die ahead of time and see if you can find a
    printer who already has one that\u2019s similar, if it\u2019s just a round or
    slightly odd shape there are already plenty floating around.\r\n\r\n<cite>It\u2019s
    good to have another green printer. All the ones I know about are in the SF bay
    area.</cite>\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a great green printer just outside of Washington
    DC\u2014and they take it seriously, not just marketing gimmicks and lip service.
    Of course, with the newer restrictions on printing inks and the trend toward selling
    bales of waste paper for recycling, the whole industry will be green soon."

- body: "What's the name of the green printer outside of Washington DC? Light-Works
    is great, but they do primarily large format printing, so I'm always looking for
    green sources for smaller media. \r\n\r\nLight-Works takes it really seriously,
    too, they sourced their new UV Ink printer from Austria, and I think they're the
    first in the US to have both environmentally sound substrates AND printing processes.
    \r\n\r\nI had NO IDEA how toxic ink was until I read their website - and I didn't
    know chlorine bleached paper produced dioxin (which is apparently second only
    to radioactive waste in toxicity - ick!) \r\n\r\nAK"

    for two weeks starting Monday.  Does anyone have a printer or letterpress recommendation
    in Beantown?  I need an affordable shop to produce about 1000 business cards with
    a custom die or laser cut.\r\n\r\nAny advice? Thanks."
