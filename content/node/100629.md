  largest collection of typeface data. For a technical update of the Typo3 based website
  I need 520,\u2013 \u20AC. I can give 100,\u2013 \u20AC by myself, and my provider
  will support the update with another 80,\u2013 \u20AC. So I need 340,\u2013 \u20AC.\r\n\r\nCould
  somebody here imagine to help me in this case?"

      security updates? Time to switch to a different CMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. The
      update itself is for free, as Typo3 is in general (GNU licence). But I can\u2019t
      do this by myself, so I need the help of a Typo3 coder. I\u2019ve got an offer
      about 520,\u2013 \u20AC. I have collected 200,\u2013 \u20AC by now and I need
      another 320,\u2013 \u20AC ( 418,163 US-$ ) to complete my mission.\r\n\r\nThis
      is all I need in the moment. There will be a new logo and web design, but I
      get this for free from a colleague. There will be no expensive relaunches. Maybe
      later."
