  as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nA friend thinks it's close to Akzidenz-Grotesk Condensed,
  but not an exact match.   \r\n\r\nAnyone have an idea?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. "

    is URW\u2019s clone of Helvetica, but those stubby crossbars on the f and t seem
    to be particular to Nimbus. Keep in mind that in the early 80s, this would have
    been phototypeset; digital fonts don\u2019t always match perfectly to metal or
    photo antecedents."
