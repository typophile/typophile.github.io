  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to

    although I guess the Z diagonal is supposed to be a downstroke, they are too unsimilar.

    and personality. Italic is also very proportional and well done. But I guess the
    bold is somewhat excessive \u2013 it's almost a black style. The /e/ and /a/ storeys
    became very closed.\r\n\r\nIt would interesting to have a medium height to expand
    the family.\r\n\r\nYou may improve some little points:\r\n\r\n<strong>1.</strong>
    in /j/ the vertical nodes are misaligned;\r\n<strong>2.</strong> in /k/ the bottom
    leg is very heavy;\r\n<strong>3.</strong> in /T/ inclination of the right cut
    is out of font's general style;\r\n<strong>4.</strong> in /s/ and /S/ there are
    small vector problems (bumps, misalignments) in curves;\r\n<strong>5.</strong>
    difference in strokes of /A/ and /K/ are higher than one finds in other letters
    (N, W, Y).\r\n\r\nGood job! Soon I also would like to hear your critique for the
    serif I'm developing."

    is indeed actually a black style. Later on I'll interpolate the bold.\r\nI've
    opened up the a and e in the black styles a bit, much better readability indeed.\r\nI've
    also redrawn k, s and S, als much better. I'm still working on the diagonal strokes
    in A, K, N, W, Y and Z, I always seem to have some difficulties with them. Is
    there any \"easy\" way to do them?\r\nThe right (and left) cut on the T is actually
    something that is repeated in E and F.\r\n\r\nOne question: what do you mean by
    point 1 (about j)? I don't see it...\r\n\r\nI'm an amateur type designer myself,
    so I don't know if I'll be of any use as a criticaster, nevertheless I'ld really
    like to see your design for the serif!\r\n\r\nI'll post another PDF when I've
    adjusted the diagonals in the capitals."

  body: "Sorry, I didn't notice the right cut at /T/ was also used in /F/ and /E/.
    Anyway, as this is very typical of /T/ in serifed, old style fonts, I think it
    becomes a bit strange to a contemporary, squarish sans. But this is subjective.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know an easy way to treat these diagonals \u2013 I also have dificulties
    to even the colour of /v/w/x/k/ strokes myself. My method is to analise how they
    do in other good fonts and test test test test... Hope Typophile fellows could
    help on this.\r\n\r\nThe /j/ is a minor issue:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capturar_4730.gif]\r\n\r\nProbably
    you did work with two pieces and the nodes of one aren't aligned to grid. Illustrator
    sometimes does not align a node properly. This is usual after pathfinder and reflect
    operations, even if the original pieces have nodes aligned to grid. It seems to
    be a problem with the roundness of internal measures."

    They seem exaggeratedly square compared to the larger curves like O, D, C, U,
    etc.

    can push it further to make a black weight.\r\nThis is all looking quite neat
    and tidy. \r\nI think B is a bit wide compared to the other letters. \r\nThe italics
    need a bit of correction. Slanting alone has left the A and N particularly a bit
    unbalanced in weight and contrast.\r\nCap Y looks unbalanced somehow.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    I'll have time to look at this in more depth later this week. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thats a really nice design. I like especially the thin connections of curves
    and verticals.\r\n\r\nSome things that come to my mind:\r\n\r\n- You show a lot
    of contrast in your diagonals for example in V, W, k, x but no (or very low) contrast
    in diagonals of v.\r\n- Holes in R and P are okay (even if I personally dont like
    it) but R and P draw a lot of attention because they are the only 2 characters
    with those holes. I suggest to either drop those holes at all or put even more
    in other characters.\r\n- S is to heavy compared with other capitals.\r\n\r\nGreat
    work with the italic and bold. How do you do them? Do you have a Multiple Master
    of your design?"

    and /R/.\r\n\r\nI've drawn these characters in Illustrator (I haven't yet bought
    FontLab, it's on my wish list), so no Multiple Master tools used here. I've skewed
    the roman to make the italic, but that not really the way to do them, although
    it does seem to work. The bold style I've drawn from scratch, with the regular
    style as a template.\r\n\r\nI hope to post the updated PDF this weekend."

  body: "Yeah, I was also wondering if type design is somehow more appealing to males!\r\n\r\nLet
    me come back to this in a day or two. I think you're definitely on a good path,
    but will need to examine the forms more closely to give useful advice.\r\n\r\nThe
    proportions are getting much more harmonious. However, a quick glance tells me
    you still need to resolve the contrast. A and x have quite noticeable contrast
    whilst other glyphs are a bit less pronounced. (Compare x with e for example.)\r\n\r\nDid
    I say anything about the quotes/comma already? Forgive me, I'm quite picky about
    commas for some reason, and I think yours need to be like curved rectangles instead
    of tadpoles to fit nicely in this design. \r\n\r\nYour descenders look different
    lengths.\r\n\r\nI'll be back in a day or two... ;)"

    Please check out the updated PDF above.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I've updated /S/ (thinner)
    and /R/ (rounder) again. So far I've only redrawn the regular style and updated
    the italic, the bold style is yet to be done..."

    small misalignment inside the /k/ (both regular and bold). The cedilla seems a
    bit dislocated to left. And I guess the dot on /i/ bold is very much heavier if
    compared to the regular weight.\r\n\r\nWell, it seems type design is mostly a
    male universe. This may explain why there are so many fonts with female names
    (Anna, Celeste, Victoria, Christiana, Ashley, Caecilia, Carolina, Emma, Isabela,
    Isadora, Joanna, Korinna, Shelley, Tiffany and so on...)"

    shortening of capitals, descenders and ascenders and in doing so visually enlarging
    x-height. I also feel that with these new caps the relationship in stroke thickness
    between lc and caps is much better and gives it a much more modern feel.\r\nContrast
