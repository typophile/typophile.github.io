  body: "This is a designed logotype either based on [[http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/|Akkurat]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neuzeit-s/neuzeits-bookheavy/|Neuzeit
    S]] or Helvetica Neue. If it is Helvetica, the designer compressed the lowercase
    e\u2019s slightly and corrected the s shape. But I think the letters s, e and
    r fit with Akkurat. The dots on the i were drawn and the letter t was modified
    to fit with the design."
