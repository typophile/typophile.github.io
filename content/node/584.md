  <BR> <BR>pfaedit is basically a Unix/Linux X11 app, but there is also a cygwin version
  that can be used under Windows. Installation instructions for both Mac OS X and
  Windows are available on the pfaedit home page:'

  body: ' Floating-Point Unit, or a chip &#40;or part of a chip&#41; that does &#40;relatively&#41;
    complex math in hardware, for speed &#40;usually between a factor of 4 and 10,
    but can go up to like 30 for transcendental stuff&#41;. Before Motorola&#39;s
    PowerPC and Intel&#39;s Pentium, FPUs were separate &#40;like the 68882 - man,
    I miss that chip&#41;, so software didn&#39;t assume you had an FPU, or had a
    special version for FPUs. The problem is that FPU instructions are specific to
    the FPU, so for example something written for the 68882 won&#39;t work on the
    PPC, which is why you use the non-FPU version, which won&#39;t be as fast as native
    PPC math, but like one of my CompSci teachers once said about a contract competition
    he had won: &#34;Hey, my code would be faster too if it didn&#39;t need to work.&#34;

    <BR>Just so more recent visitors to this particular thread dont get misled, there
    are two versions of the iMac2. The 15inch and 17inch widescreen version. The latter
    has a completely respectable resolution of 1440x900.'

  body: ' It makes me worry because a lot of stuff is designed around the 4:3 aspect
    ratio in general, and certain screen resolutions in particular. Like when I make
    a Director movie that takes over the screen, I don&#39;t want an unpredictable/ungainly
    border around it. <BR> <BR>Apple had its own resolutions for a while, but then
    they sensibly started conforming to the Windows sizes &#40;except for that funky
    1152 thing&#41;, but now they do this... The thing is, it&#39;s not just Apple:
    I was recently pricing different configurations of a Compaq laptop, and the options
    went 1024, 1440, 1600 - no 1280, which is such a nice resolution for a 15&#34;
    LCD. I think LCD manufacturers are targeting DVD playback, and the computer manufacturers
    have to go along to maintain good pricing. <BR> <BR>hhp '
