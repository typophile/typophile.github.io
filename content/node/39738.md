  I've maxed out my card and I really need this font badly. "

    the designer directly, that would be the proper approach in your situation. He
    might be able to help you, then again he might not.

    similar to the one you want that are free?

  body: "Why not use one of the fonts you spent \xA3500 on? If there is not a single
    one you could use \u2013 well, then you\u2019ve made some really bad decisions.\r\nWhat
    about drawing letterforms by yourself? Perla isn\u2019t the face you\u2019d use
    for body text, so I assume it\u2019s about some headlines. Doing them by yourself
    (be it by hand or digital) gives you the freedom to meet your requirements even
    better. And it doesn\u2019t cost you a shilling."

  body: "Its more individual and as Florian said drawing letter forms, binars vectors
    etc is interesting and can appear in your work as proper typographical research
    and practice.\r\n\r\nAlso by creating your own typeface your tutors at uni will
    appreciate your work more.\r\nBut I understand,  I have been there and done that
    and when on a tight deadline it can seem daunting not implementing that you were
    going to do this from the start, but if you can fit this in do it. Your tutors
    will love it. You experimenting.\r\n\r\nIt will be more your work, and who knows
    you could develop the typeface for future use.\r\n\r\nHow are you combining illustration
    and typography?"

    so I'm trying to make my work as versatile as possible.  \r\n\r\nI've decided
    on doing a campaign for anti fur, so what i've done is the front cover & back
    cover i've used type in order to make faces of fox & a rabbit. I'm just uploading
    on flickr, and i'll post the link on here.  I love feedback, and the more negative
    the better, because that makes me step up to the plate even more. \r\n\r\nI would
    love to be able to create my own type face, but the problem I have is that I'm
    so incredibly fussy and I keep on stopping, starting, binning and then in the
    end just get even more frustrated. "

  body: 'Not a typeface: Lettering. Do the lettering by hand, specifically for this
    project. Do it on a transparency or tissue, so you can do it a few times and pick
    the best one. Lettering isn''t type. It can fit the exact shape of your layout,
    it can bend and squeeze, and it can be messy. Look at Sagmeister''s stuff. Sketch
    where the lettering will go with a pencil, to figure out how it will fit, and
    then take brush, pen, marker, crayon, whatever, and do the final lettering. And
    to your inevitable next question: Just Do It. '

  body: "Why are you scared of not getting a job out of the end result?\r\n\r\nI am
    a bit like you i start a font then get increasingly fussy, I have got into a routine
    of when I get like this I have a file of unfinished fonts, I just keep going back
    to them, and over time they get more and more different, until I have a range
    of finished fonts. Font faces are all unique and take time and effort to make
    them equivalent to your subject. Like a piece of art you want it to translate
    your inner thoughts at that time, my names of font always correlate to the idea
    behind it.\r\n\r\nHave you not thought about combining some typefaces to do this?\r\n\r\n"

    in those red vector furs. They look great as they are just suggesting some more
    \"shock effect\".\r\nHave you tried to make the animal faces half the size made
    with fewer and bigger words? I think as few words as possible to get the same
    amount of face recognition as you have now could be something to try.\r\nTo old
    ... neeeh. Good luck!\r\nNice work btw.\r\n"

    it depends on what aspect of design interests you. But I know PLENTY of working,

    the Perla would be for \"VICTIM\" ? Because that type as it is now is pretty dull."
