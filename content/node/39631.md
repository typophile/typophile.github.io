  body: I'm wrong, It's spelled KRAVTIZ Extra Thermal... I thought it was wrong but
    that's what the style guide says...

  body: "I did & I get a similar face but the letter spacing is no where near the
    same. But I guess I can mess with it to get what I want. And it's Kravitz, the
    style guide says Kravtiz. I would think someone would have caught that.\r\n\r\nBut
    it seems weird that a national retail store would use a free font with bad letter
    spacing on their packaging... Maybe not, I've just never see it before. "

    is exactly what I am looking for. The one I downloaded from freefonts.org, had
    different spacing, so I think I'm good now. Thanks for everyone's help."

  body: '"national retail store" = what''s the absolute biggest profit margin we can
    squeeze out of this? So, I guess I''m not surprised free fonts aren''t part of
    that equation. ;o)'
