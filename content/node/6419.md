body: Got a client who designed her packaging with &#34;Kabob Black&#34; -- some mystery
  font. She had included the font with the keyline &#40;done in Acrobat&#41; but it
  was a  PC font. I looked it up on the web and it was on <a href="http://www.randypavelich.com/fonts/index.cfm?g=11&amp;jump=10">a
  free font download site</a>, PC only. Well, I looked at that &#34;2&#34; and said,
  wait a sec, this is fricking Kabel! Yes indeed, they used a knockoff Kabel for their
  packaging. Which was cool because we had Kabel so I could substitute one for the
  other. <BR> <BR>So I send an email to the client and urge her to simply license
  her own damn copy of Kabel -- she had been running into problems with Kabob with
  printers and other design agencies. <BR> <BR>Her response? Maybe we could just use
  something else that&#39;s free. Woman, it costs $29 to license one weight of Kabel.
  It won&#39;t break the bank. <BR> <BR>I just had to vent.

    Creampuff: we purchased a license for Eclat and  <BR>used the proper typeface
    for the posters, banners, ads and  <BR>whatnot. I understand your feelings, this
    sucks big time.'

  body: 'John, you probably have done this already, but perhaps suggest that working
    with free fonts can present more trouble than its worth &#40;as her experience
    already attests&#41; and show her a simple cost breakdown like: <BR> <BR>New font:
    $30 for x number of seats/devices <BR>My time: $100/hour for 1 hour fixing problems.
    <BR>Your SAVINGS: $70 &#40;more if you add time and trouble at prepress or printers&#41;
    <BR>Bad fonts = bad business <BR>Rip-off fonts = false economy <BR>Spend wisely
    <BR> <BR>Personally, I don&#39;t think free &#40;speech/beer&#41; fonts are bad,
    I think bad fonts and rip-offs are. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: Good advice, Jon. Plus, the packaging was for the E.U. and this ripoff font
    doesn&#39;t have accents &#40;I believe&#41; so she substituted Futura Extra Bold!
    for those characters. One advantage of commercial fonts is a full character set.
