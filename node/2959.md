body: I&#39;ve had DIN 16 in my stockpile of typefaces, and in my efforts to be legit,
  I am trying to find a place to buy it.  <BR> <BR>It was created by The Font Company
  which I can&#39;t find, and the only site that mentions it is <a href="http://www.atomictype.co.uk"
  target="_blank">www.atomictype.co.uk</a>, but that site hasn&#39;t been touched
  in years. <BR> <BR>DIN 16 looks like a rounded FF DIN.

    a reseller for these Mecanorma <BR>fonts trapped in licensing limbo.

  body: It&#39;s not on MyFonts nor Phil&#39;s Fonts I&#39;m afraid. You should  <BR>also
    look for &#34;isonorm&#34; typefaces. I think Stephen might  <BR>know where to
    find this one.

  body: Eric, <BR>You said that your font has a Font Company copyright. Precision
    Type <BR>carries Font Company Din 16 and its italic. I&#39;m just going to link
    to their <BR><a href="http://www.precisiontype.com/fontadv.asp" target="_blank">
    Search page</a>. Just do a Search on &#39;Din 16&#39; and you&#39;ll be shown
    both fonts.
