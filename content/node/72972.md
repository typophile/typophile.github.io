body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI've started doing freelance jobs with wedding/event planners
  and wanted to come up with a business card that speaks to my new clientele. The
  card will be letterpressed. It's  minimal but I was hoping the typography and tactile
  feeling of the letterpress would carry it through and give it a classic elegant
  look and feel.\r\n\r\nOne last note: to get the deal on letterpressing this must
  be one color black and one sided.\r\n\r\nI really would love to know what you think,
  any opinions, criticism, anything at all!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nStephanie "

  body: "My eye wants the /or/ in Pryor to be connected.\r\nWhere the swash off the
    /e/ gets thick, perhaps it comes to the fore too much (it shouldn't grab attention
    more than the letters in your name).\r\nText at bottom looks too tightly spaced?
    (Keep in mind letterpress will spread the strokes a bit.)\r\nI think you could
    do without the dotted lines - maybe just keep the top horizontal one?"

  body: I think you can manipulate the negative space better and in doing so connect
    the two elements better. Right now it just looks like two different objects on
    one card.
