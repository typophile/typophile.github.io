body: "I am trying to produce a scaleable dot-based font family in Fontlab as Mac
  flavoured Opentype. I\u2019ve had a lot of trouble with getting small circles to
  be geometrically correct in Truetype (the beziers flatten the arcs) but Opentype
  keeps them geometrically consistent.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have a bigger problem which
  I can't seem to fix. \r\n\r\nThe more complex font shown here (with the six dot
  stroke) refuses to print as Opentype from InDesign or Acrobat on a Konica Minolta
  PagePro 9100 laser printer with 64Mb memory. It doesn't crash \u2013 just ignores
  the file and clears the print queue. I reckon that there must be too much data in
  each individual character at the higher dot pitch \u2013 and that I am exceeding
  a Postscript limit. I can't find any info on this and Fontlab tech support have
  been unable to help. Any ideas on solutions or workrounds would be welcome as I
  would like to construct a large family of scaleable dot fonts.\r\n\r\nAnother issue,
  which may be related, is that I have chosen to set the type height to its true size,
  1008 UPM rather than 1000 UPM, so that the fonts can be accurately scaled to size.
  If I don't do this, the scaling maths becomes difficult to resolve as does the dot
  structure. Any advice on this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n"

    to outlines in the final fonts? I imagine that printer programmers aren\u2019t
    thinking about fonts with dozens of components in the characters.\r\n\r\nYou might
    want to contact Christian Schwartz directly about creating dot fonts as he has
    done a few."

  body: "It might be interesting to try printing the same page on  a PS printer with
    a lot more RAM and/or Adobe PostScript. My recollection is that the QMS clonescript
    used by Konica Minolta was reportedly the worst of the major PostScript clones,
    or at least it was a few years back.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Many thanks, all, for your help on this. I'm going to go with Adam's advice
    given elsewhere and abandon the fonts for now.
