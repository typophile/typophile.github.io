body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find information on which applications support
  different lookup types. There seems to be lots of sources of info on which applications
  support which OpenType <em> features, </em> but I haven't been able to find a source
  of info on the <em> types </em> of OpenType lookups which are supported.\r\n\r\nIn
  particular, I am interested in which application support GSUB type 7 lookups (lookups
  with the <code> useExtension </code> flag, i.e. those with 32-bit offsets) and GSUB
  type 8 lookups (<code>reversesub </code> lookups).\r\n\r\nAlso, if a font contains
  these types of lookups and an application does <em> not </em> support them, will
  applications simply not process the relevant subtables, or will it potentially cause
  some applications to crash (or bring about Armageddon or some other equally undesirable
  result)?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have a budget which allows me to invest in
  a large number of test applications so I was hoping that there might be a summary
  out there somewhere.\r\n\r\nTIA,\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\n[Thread renamed for clarity]"
