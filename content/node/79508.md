  and we are curious what you folks have to say, did we get the mood right for our
  exhibition?  The video is on youtube but I'd rather send you to the embedded link,
  for proper context:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.whoisntjohngalt.com/cfa2011\r\n\r\n\r\nLike
  I said, it's thirty seconds long so I'm sorry if I've taken your time needlessly,
  but we are looking for critique here to better our design on all fronts, typeface
  included. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nteam whoisntjohngalt"

    stock art / type.

  body: "@aluminum - art world = slightly less literal meaning of \"viral\", but we
    are sending it out and posting it throughout our arts community, listservs, campuses,
    etc, so when I said \"going viral\" I meant to mean a \"lot\" of people will be
    seeing it, relative of course.  No need for the flame.\r\n\r\n\r\n@penn - What
    could be better? One point of improvement for those two negative criticisms would
    make your opinion a lot more valid to us, thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n-JG"

  body: "The use of Rosewood, Snell Roundhand, the random type placement (lack of
    alignment to anything), the use of stock art vector vines, the faux grunge treatment
    \u2014 all of it speaks to a style that doesn't say 'contemporary art' to me.
    It doesn't seem right for the intended audience \u2014 or maybe I'm misinterpreting
    who that audience is. "

  body: Doesn't look contemporary to me either. Rosewood in particular seems like
    an odd choice.

    maybe you are completely sincere but when a new user signs up anonymously using
    an Ayn Rand reference and starts posting links back to their own site using social-media-marketing-buzz-words,
    my spidey senses begin to tingle. Again, this may be 100% sincere, and, if so,
    mea culpa. "

    he was just advertising his event he wouldn't have come back to the forum as he
    did to discuss the responses he received.\r\n\r\nJG, it might help if you could
    give us some background info on the design & type choices you made and the thinking
    behind them. Thanks.\r\n"

    I were to spam you, you'd know it.  This is an artists community, and I know that.
    \ This is also a hub of very educated and like-minded individuals, and having
    a worldwide exhibition requires all the feedback we can get.  I am real, the exhibition
    is real, and your feedback <b> IS </b> appreciated.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, though,
    if you REALLY want to see spam, our twitter feed is going well (@whoisntjohngalt)
    and has correspondents talking about our show / doing street art on 6 continents
    right now.  We just landed in Sao Paulo, Brazil!\r\n\r\nilguiri@whoisntjohngalt.com"
