body: "I'm creating design templates for my organisation, using Microsoft Office,
  but am having difficulty choosing a typeface.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's typography page
  gives some useful lists of which faces are included with different incarnations.
  For example, Office Pro 2003 has the following:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/product.aspx?PID=143\r\n\r\nIt's
  decent enough, containing several weights of Bodoni, Franklin Gothic, Gill Sans
  and so on.\r\n\r\nWord 2000, on the other hand, contains a far smaller selection:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/product.aspx?PID=143\r\n\r\nOther
  versions (eg. the Microsoft Works series) appear to contain something in between.\r\n\r\nMy
  organisation uses Office Pro 2003, so I can choose from the longer list. But we
  will need to be able to send documents outside our organisation. In these cases,
  I can't be sure that the fonts I use will be available. The recipient could be using
  any kind of .doc viewer, but it appears that they'll only get the full range of
  typefaces with Microsoft's more expensive bundles.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else been in
  this situation, and how have you handled it? It appears my choices are:\r\n\r\n1)
  A two-tiered Word experience. For example, I could specify Gill Sans for use throughout.
  This would work for everyone in my organisation, and most people we email documents
  to (who will be in organisations with similar IT systems). But for some recipients,
  the fonts won't be available. Which fonts will Word substitute, and will the degradation
  be elegant?\r\n\r\n2) Choose from one of Microsoft's core fonts for web. I'm confident
  this solution would work in the same way on any machine, but I'd be limited to fonts
  like Arial, Georgia, Verdana, Times ... Comic Sans. This is undesirable to me from
  a design perspective, but should I eschew such concerns in favour of a consistent
  appearance for all viewers?\r\n\r\nComments and insight are very welcome."

  body: "m-ga, I've used both of those approaches.\r\n\r\nI guess it depends on how
    far you need to extend the corporate identity already in use to extend to these
    kind of documents. But in short you can't expect to maintain exact appearance
    of Word-originated docs outside your organisation. If you absolutely need to,
    you convert them into PDFs first! Aside from fonts, other aspects of a document
    such as margins and use of half-point sizes depend to some extent on the currectly
    selected printer.\r\n\r\nNote re Option 1 -- you can embed TrueType fonts in the
    document fonts, but I don't think it's 100% reliable; there's a suspicious lack
    of documentation on exactly how the different levels of embedding permissions
    are implemented for example.\r\n\r\nSubstitution is built into Truetype but I
    personally have no idea how replacement of a given font is determined. I do know
    that in Word, a user without the correct font will see the text in the substituted
    font, but it will be described as using the originally specified font in the font
    dropdown box etc - this makes it a bit difficult to see what font is actually
    being subsituted in."
