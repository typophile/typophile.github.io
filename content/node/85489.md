  for a New Orleans restaurant which closed some years ago, but which has recently
  reopened and asked me to help with their website and screen printing. Problem is
  no one knows the font of the copy of the logo they've provided, who made it, how
  or when. I'm not even sure it's all one font. Can anyone help? \r\nThanks in advance.
  I've all but given up hope.\r\nStacy"

  body: "Hi Stacy,\r\nIt seems like a custom lettering with mixed styles.\r\nEven
    the LC 'l' which is present twice is different on each instance.\r\n\r\nI can
    only suggest some starting points:\r\n\r\n=> For /l/d/w/l/i/n: Flange BQ (http://new.myfonts.com/search/Flange+bq/fonts/)\r\nor
    Llewelyn Heavy SF\r\n\r\n=> For /a/s:   EdwardianEF ExtraBold\r\n\r\n=> For N:
    Articula Display SSi [Regular]\r\n\r\nI found the alternatives using Find my Font
