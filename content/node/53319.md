  font (with the same encoding and kerning classes) some, and sometimes a lot of the
  kerning pairs are gone!\r\nSo, what is the best way to open kerning without losing
  kerning pairs?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nPieter\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    well, but sometimes it forgets for example 100 kerningpairs.\r\n\r\nPieter"
