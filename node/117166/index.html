  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi Philes!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a brand refresh for a company focused on fashion entertainment.
The original logo was perfect for at startup at that time, but their strategy has changed alot since then&hellip; and therefore a logo-update has become a hot topic :-)</p>
<p>The logo is loosly based on some spikes seen in Tryon Park in New York, where the founders got the idea for the company.</p>
<p>The problem with the current logo is alignment-issues, not very legible in small sizes and lack of character - especially in B/W&hellip; and so on.
I&rsquo;ve included some excerpts from the presentation.</p>
<p>Anywhooo&hellip; I&rsquo;ve recently presented a new redesign which they love and we are starting to plan the roll out of the identity.
The new design is more simple and with respect to the original idea.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d really like your input on how to properly set some guidelines for this logo - I mean, how to set some rules for the individual sizes of symbol and logotype? Until now I&rsquo;ve only done this by eye and simple guides - and the client is requesting a mini brand manual now and my experience is rather vague.</p>
<p>So please guide me you cool type-people :-)</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>
<p>/S</p>

<p>the client is requesting a mini brand manual</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you Google &ldquo;Brand Manual&rdquo; (or similar phrases) you should be able to find some examples in PDF format, although they may be more detailed than you need.</p>
<p>It may help if you consider what the manual will be used for. If your client will be using people with design training to put together their pieces, you might be able to rely on their training and good judgement and focus on factual issues such as the fonts, colors, general look of the pieces, etc.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s to help people with NO design training to put pieces together (for example if a secretary is asked to create a booklet) then you need to give more detailed instructions to avoid them making beginner&rsquo;s mistakes (don&rsquo;t make the logo too small, keep some blank space around it, don&rsquo;t put it on a patterned background, use a white logo if on a dark background, etc.).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how to set some rules for the individual 
sizes of symbol and logotype?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is largely determined by the designer&rsquo;s judgement. All  you can do is create some general guidelines and show examples for common situations. If you find some PDFs of other manuals that might help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B/W version not dynamic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well you could make it grayscale to get the overlap effect, but I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about the black-and-white version unless your client is still printing a lot of booklets that way. In the past a b&amp;w version was extremely important, but it&rsquo;s less so today since so much communication is via the internet, PDFs, emails, and other situations where color is free.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know B&amp;W is still important for social media sites, as an example, because a lot of other websites link to them, and often use a custom webfont with social media logos to do so. Since the twitter bird is just one color, it easily looks good as white on black, black on white, or in the traditional blue.</p>
<p>I like the all-red logo, especially because of the bigger negative space / outline in the middle of it. Hate how the other one was pencil thin. And I like that it&rsquo;s all red too, looks nice in B&amp;W, and it sort of looks like a dinosaur footprint which makes me extremely happy. (I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and assume the company makes dinosaur skeletons for museums) :)</p>
