  Citizen Magazine.\r\nIt's a rough sketch but I've been slowly chopping away at it
  for a while and I just can't look at it anymore in a critical way.\r\n\r\nany feedback?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo_5608.jpg]"

- body: "Sorry, but it reads \"aTSZEN\" because the <em>c</em> is morphing into the
    <em>i</em> and the second <em>i</em> doesn't match the first. \r\n\r\nWhen I lose
    objectivity, I have to take an overnight break from the project. I also find it
    helpful to print it out at multiple sizes; it's truly amazing what paper and ink
    reveals. "

    of slab and regular serif appropriate?\r\nThanks for viewing!"
