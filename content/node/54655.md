  be more exact and like the two pages per week spread i think.\r\n\r\nA few years
  ago, after hours of perusing Office Depot I settled on the At-A-Glance Weekly Executive
  Day planner and have purchased a few over the past few years. Unfortunately I went
  to office depot again today and am depressed to say that the quality seems to have
  significantly gone down. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.officedepot.com/a/products/699145/AT-A-GLANCE-Executive-13-Month/\r\n\r\nSo,
  after hours of searching I decided upon the Dualview by Day-Timer, which has some
  cool design and print features with the added benefit of being half the price:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.officedepot.com/a/products/305115/Day-Timer-DualView-Planner-5-1/\r\n\r\nBut
  I am always looking for an improved day planner, since i have to stare and use it
  everyday. What do you use?"
