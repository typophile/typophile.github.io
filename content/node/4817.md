    ITC Bookman Italic</a> <a href="http://www.urw.fr/france/fonts/b/b018a34t.htm"

  body: Just used Tango on a mix CD. It&#39;s a good alternative  <BR>- not as obvious
    as Bookman Swash but still captures  <BR>that &#39;70s LA feeling. &#40;That&#39;s

  body: I bet the t-shirt letters were iron-on. It&#39;s not ITC Bookman Italic Swash,
    but it&#39;s very close.

  body: I think the font on the shirts is ITC Bookman. The original did not have italic
    forms for the lowercase characters--just slanted roman forms. The other possibility,
    now that I look at it closely, is that it could be Monotype&#39;s clone of ITC
    Bookman, Bookman Oldstyle, with swashes added, and the cap &#34;S&#34; taken from
    the original Bookman swash characters. <BR> <BR>I think I need a vacation.

  body: As often as people ask about Bookman Swash here, it seems that digitizing
    it could be a profitable endeavor for someone. <BR> <BR>Can anyone suggest other
    alternatives? Tango BT is nice, but I&#39;d love something that includes some
    of the lowercase swashes, too, for when I need that full 70s feeling. Especially
    that &#34;r&#34; that just reaches up over it&#39;s neighbor. It&#39;s so bad
    it&#39;s good!
