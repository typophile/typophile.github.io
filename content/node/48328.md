  for example 72 pixels\r\non the screen as default instead of the 10-12 used normally.
  I read that the standard\r\ncap height for building fonts in fontlab is about 700.
  Now, there is a common way to\r\ndo with fonts that should use normally in posters,
  i.e. only in big format, and set\r\nthis value to a more appropriate or should I
  leave it as standard?\r\nThanks,\r\n            tano\r\n"

  body: "There isn't really a technical way to force users to use an outline font
    at a specific point size, as far as I know (someone please correct me if I'm wrong).\r\n\r\nThe
    best most type designers do is give some clue to this nature in the name of the
    font, appending \"Display\" or \"Big\" or even \"Billboard\" to the base name,
    along with explanation in the accompanying documentation of the font's intended
    use."

  body: "The 700 em-unit cap height is the default ascender height FontLab (and other
    type design software) gives you. You can change the value, but the total of the
    ascender and descender values should remain a multiple of 1000 for a postscript
    font or a multiple of 1024 for a TrueType font, the difference between these two
    numbers setting your baseline.\r\n\r\nThere are other settings you would have
    to get into to set the actual line height. This just sets the coordinate plane
    for you to draw your points and curves on."

  body: "You can make the ascender height larger than normal, but you should have
    a corresponding decrease in descender depth, thus the maximum height will remain
    the same, but more will be above the baseline than usual.\r\n\r\nAnd then you
    select a large point size in your graphics or layout program. You can't stop someone
    from trying to set your font at 3 pt. but you can make it not look good at that
    size."

  body: "The UPM size of 1000 can be used in all fonts regardless of the format (Type
    1, OpenType PS, OpenType TT). The UPM size always corresponds to the point size,
    so when the user chooses a 10 point type, the 10 points always correspond to the
    UPM size, i.e. typically to the 1000 units. If the user chooses a 12 pt type,
    then 12 pt correspond to the 1000 units. \r\n\r\nSo, if the user chooses 10 pt
    type and your uppercase letters are 700 units, they will be exactly 7 pt high
    \u2014\_and this is the industry standard. (In 20 pt type they will be exactly
    14 pt high etc.)\r\n\r\nBut of course you can make a font that is \"large on the
    body\", i.e. the letters are unusually large in relation to the point size. For
    example, if you draw your uppercase letters to be 2000 units high, then in a 10
    pt type they will be 20 pt high. If you draw them to be 7200 units high then in
    a 10 pt type they will be 72 pt high. \r\n\r\nYou can get the same effect, of
    course, by reducing the UPM size. If you draw your uppercase letters to be 700
    units high but you set the UPM size to 350 (which will work perfectly well in
    OpenType TT fonts and almost perfectly well in OpenType PS fonts), then the uppercase
    letters will be 20 pt high in 10 pt type. \r\n\r\nSo, as you can see, it is all
    quite simple. The relationship between the UPM size and the size of the type drawn
    in units only influences the relationship of the final font appearance in relation
    to the point size selected. \r\n\r\nAnother aspect is linespacing: you'll need
    to set our Ascender and Descender values appropriately and follow the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/13081\">vertical
    metrics</a> guidelines. \r\n\r\nBut note that the recommendation that Ascender
    + Descender = UPM size is only an industry convention like the one about uppercase
    being 700 units large. Of course, if your uppercase letters are 2000 units high
    and the descenders are -500 in a 1000 UPM font, then it would make no sense to
    make Ascender + Descender = UPM. \r\n\r\nAscender + Descender (plus the optional
    TypoLineGap) determine the default linespacing for the font, and should be set
    so that the font's default linespacing looks good. The one really important point
    is that they should be unified across members of one font family \u2014 but how
    large they actually will be, it is up to the designer. \r\n\r\nA."
