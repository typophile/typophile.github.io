  body: "I think K\xFCnstler-Gotisch is a closer Art Nouveau typeface to this lettering
    (in 'Treasury of Authentic Art Nouveau Alphabets' by Petzendorfer (Dover Books)).
    This was once digitized as 'Library' in the Expresiv fonts Photo Lettering Font
    collection. You can contact me if you want to see a sample, as I have the font
    collection.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Morris Troy</a>, which is probably a better version of the <a href="http://www.p22.com/products/index.html">William
