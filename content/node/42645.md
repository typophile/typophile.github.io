body: "I just found \"Penguin By Design\" this week, and fully awoke to the glory
  of Tschichold and Schmoller. Tschichold's Penguin Shakespeare cover design--mmph!
  Schmoller's rigid, beautiful typographic rules for every situation--ka-chah! I had
  always loved Schmoller's hardcover <cite>Pelican Shakespeare</cite> (with its original
  spine and paper, still one of the most beautiful books I've ever seen), but without
  particularly fastening onto him as a Great Man. And Tschichold I mostly just associated
  with Sabon.\r\n\r\nMy question: Where can I best glut my need for lots and lots
  of information about both these great Penguin typographers and designers? (Not only
  Tschichold.) I want to know everything they knew!\r\n\r\nIn real life I am an author,
  and I now want to make sure my next book obeys all of their Rules. Or at least infringes
  them <cite>knowingly.</cite> The designer of my first book, a person employed by
  a major, much-loved trade publisher, wanted to letterspace its italic lowercase
  running heads. Which made me feel that it's every man for himself out there.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    have more pull with your publisher than I imagine authors do. I admit to be interested
    in Schmoller now though.

    harden his heart against the accusation of being too fussy.\"\r\n\r\nHans Schmoller,

  body: I got deeper into design as an author who wanted his books to look good, like
    you. I believe that your control over design will be nothing or minimal, unless
    you can get it into your contract that you will be consulted. Of course, there
    may be some agreeable people who are happy to have your input. But as usually
    I believe this stuff is done pretty quickly on deadline, it is tough. The book
    designers here should be able to tell you more about the process. Good luck!

  body: "In my experience (mostly trade illustrated reference), authors have no control
    over their books. Some very important authors may have influence, but no authority.
    They may have some limited veto power over certain elements, particularly as related
    to the proper communication of content. But this usually occurs through their
    editor, who is the author's advocate within the publishing process.\r\n\r\nAny
    influence is usually earned through charisma and intelligence. If an author has
    particular expertise in his/her area of authorship, then he/she may have some
    influence over some aspects of the cover.\r\n\r\nThe underlying principle at work
    is that the publisher is the one who is taking the greatest financial risk in
    publishing the work. As such, the publisher has the right to do whatever it deems
    best, in terms of design, marketing, etc., to ensure the best return on its investment.
    \r\n\r\nIf design is of great importance to an author, then he/she would always
    do well to research a publisher's catalog before signing. If you don't like the
    other books that are being published, there's no reason to expect that you, as
    an author, will be able to influence your book to be significantly different.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, if you're signing with a publisher because you feel they are successful
    selling to the market you're addressing, then you should give them the benefit
    of the doubt when it comes to doing the same with your work. \r\n\r\nI hope I'm
    not sounding like \"the publisher is always right.\" I'm trying to paint a realistic
    picture. One in which you might say, \"the publisher always thinks it is right.\"\r\n\r\nThat's
    not to say that an author should not educate himself and engage in discussions
    about design where he feels strongly. As I said, influence is earned through charisma
    and intelligence, and operates through engagement and discussion, not authority
    and control.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Great replies\u2014but I can tell people are more taken with the question
    of authors-and-publishers (and designers) than with the main query, so I'll chip
    in my own experience about that!\r\n\r\nWith my first book, I did in fact have
    a lot of input\u2014almost an alarming amount, giving me the sense that no one
    was firmly in charge\u2014into the internal design of the book. (Not the cover,
    of course, where they did choose the basic picture from an image suggested by
    me, and did change the display type to be simpler, at my suggestion, but the overall
    design was nonetheless set independently of my input.) Inside the book, though,
    everything was run past me, and I had lots and lots of suggestions, nearly all
    of which were taken if they didn't add to the cost of the book. I'm not sure what
    would have happened if I had wanted something radically different from what they
    came up with, but that situation didn't arise. I had to pick up on things like
    the inconsistent use of old-style figures in italicized text, and the like, and
    I think they were probably glad that I did. It was a major publisher, so I wondered
    at times whether I only had the \"B Team\"\u2014younger, less experienced people\u2014working
    on my book, or what, but they really did let me muck around with things.\r\n\r\nMore

  body: "The Pelican Shakespeare was a special one-volume hardcover, collecting all
    the texts from the individual volumes in the Pelican Shakespeare series, edited
    by Alfred Harbage. The Pelican Shakespeare texts were all edited and produced
    by the American branch of Pelican, which was then based in Baltimore rather than
    New York, more or less to show what it could do. (The Penguin Shakespeare was
    British, the Pelican Shakespeare, American.) Schmoller's designs for the Pelican
    Shakespeare series (and the collected volume) included such nice little touches
    as non-arbitrary line numbering--only lines containing words that were annotated
    at the foot of the page were numbered. This worked perfectly in Shakespeare, given
    the high density of annotation. It was all set in Ehrhardt. And the quite wonderful
    complete hardcover version was published in 1969, originally with a green-and-gold
    spine. Later printings switched to red and gold, and at some point in the late
    1980s or the 1990s, Penguin evidently lost or damaged the dies for the spines,
    so they mocked up new (red-and-gold) ones that didn't look nearly as graceful
    as the old. Then, much more recently, they came out with a simply hideous new
    \"Complete Pelican Shakespeare,\" edited by Stephen Orgel, which is a sad and
    inadequate heir to the original.\r\n\r\nI have been on the go the past couple
    of days, but I will post some pictures of these books that I love as soon as I
    get a chance.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the designs for the Penguin Poets covers in
    that Flickr group, and on some blogs that one finds references to there, are just
    amazing. I'm surprised no one has scanned them all in at high quality (instead
    of simply photographing them) and made them available to use, e.g., as Desktop
    Patterns. \"Penguin by Design\" has a nice spread on the Penguin Poets as well."
