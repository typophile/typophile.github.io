body: "Hello, I'm looking for a font with slightly rounded corners. I need regular,
  bold and heavy versions. I want it to look a bit like the attached font - which
  was designed for UKTV and therefor not for sale. It has a modern feel but is very
  structured and regular in design. I like the fact it does not feel condensed.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help? Thanks."

      bit my head off.

  body: I always assumed that UKTV did use gotham, but seeing that example I can see
    a very slight difference in the style.

  body: To my eyes I'd say their typeface began with Gotham. I'd also love to know
    who did the typeface for UKTV.

    The corners are rounded, but not very noticeably. Nick Cooke, the designer, posts
    here. Maybe he can set you up with a .pdf to look at it more closely...
