<p>&ldquo;Luc Devroye&rsquo;s site is now closed. He is still alive and kicking, but on April 24, 2006, censorship and political correctness won against academic freedom. To the students who are counting on my course notes: sorry. To the researchers who are trying to download my work: sorry. To the conference participants of AofA 2006: sorry. To the readers of my daily social commentary: sorry. To the mathematical community: sorry. To the funding agencies of Canada who generously supported my work: sorry. We may be up again one day after purgatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. DeVroye&rsquo;s website was a great resource for anyone interested in type, and an invaluable one to those interested in font technologies.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I was going to send Mr. DeVroye a message telling him how much I appreciate the time he has put into making such a large collection of useful information and links, but I felt a bit embarassed about sending it so I didn&rsquo;t. I wish I had, and now I&rsquo;m going to ask him if he has backed up a copy of his pages about fonts.</p>
<p>You can still reach parts of his website from Google&rsquo;s cache ( http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:_73aQEnCgjAJ:cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/fonts.html+luc+devroye&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;client=safari ).</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve never met him? You&rsquo;d quickly find out that especially the last sentence is far from the truth. (Last from my quote not from your post.)  ;-)
That working at a university and working freelance (me too) each has the consequence of emphasizing different aspects should not really surprise.</p>

The issue of intellectual property rights in digital culture is a thorny one, and, coming from a non-type industry background, Luc apparently stepped on a few toes as he was finding his feet, which I&rsquo;m sure mortified him, but isn&rsquo;t that ancient history now?
His site put me in touch with a lot of people in the Canadian type community, and elsewhere, who I wasn&rsquo;t aware of, and on one of my visits to Montreal he took me to the old type section of the library at McGill.</div>

<p>Hmm, I was with you right up to &ldquo;most of his information was correct and factual.&rdquo; I once dissected a lengthy rant of his and pointed out that most of his assertions of fact were false, and many of the remainder were at least misleading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely supportive of Luc DeVroye&rsquo;s right to express his opinions on any topic he likes. And he&rsquo;s welcome to tell lies, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, although that might get him sued for libel some time. (Usually he&rsquo;s careful to quote other people, instead of asserting things directly himself - a clever tactic.)</p>
<p>However, what I object to is his posting vast numbers of links to pirated fonts. I particularly object to his doing that on a University&rsquo;s web site. I find it ludicrous that he could promote theft for years, but he posted some pictures of naked women and they shut down the whole site?</p>
<p>I think McGill owes type foundries an apology. I have no particular sympathy for DeVroye. He should have been reined in years ago.</p>

<p>as a McGill alumni, I can say that this is really crazy! I remember back in 1997, taking some of my Canadian McGill friends to a nasty frat party at SUNY Plattsburgh (small state school in the boonies of upper new york state) and the expressions of horror etched into their faces&hellip;</p>
<p>but maybe we were just nerds.</p>
<p>on another side note,
NO McGill students I knew hung out at Club Super Sexe or, for that matter, Ste. Catherines street. That was for the cheesy Americans looking for a weekend of drunken debauchery.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Luc Devroye is a professor in the Math department at McGill University. If he wants to run an inaccurate typography database, links to pirated fonts*, a blog of social commentary, and photographs of naked women*, he should do it on his own server, his own time, and his own dime. McGill was completely within their rights to shut him down. And Carleton should do the same. What exactly does the typography database have to do with Devroye&rsquo;s math teaching?</p>
<p>Mr Devroye lurks on Typophile, and I would be curious to hear his thoughts on this matter beyond the insipid statement on &ldquo;his&rdquo; website; i.e. the directory made available to him by McGill University.</p>

<p>Your logic is weak:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He was shut down for the photos only. What does piracy have to do with it? what does inaccuracy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that Luc is a controversial figure (not in my mind) only bolsters the case for free speech, and McGill should at the very least not interfere. Bureaucrats don&rsquo;t tell academics what to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Canada, you can post link to whatever you want. You can also download whatever you want. You only violate copyright laws if you upload. So says the Canadian courts, and a good reference is Michael Geist&rsquo;s website (at least his university didn&rsquo;t shut him down).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Phinney wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; what I object to is his posting vast numbers of links to pirated fonts
&hellip; He should have been reined in years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, the behaviour of Adobe Inc. is sort of schizophrenic:</p>
<p>At Adobe, Mr. Charles Geschke, Mr. John Warnock, Mr. Thomas Phinney etc. are acting as &ldquo;policemen&rdquo; and &ldquo;prosecutors&rdquo; who are running this website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/antipiracy/reportform.html">http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/antipiracy/reportform.html</a></p>
<p>At this website concerning what they call criminal &ldquo;felonies&rdquo; which &ldquo;can result in prison terms of up to five years, and felony charges with fines up to US$250,000&rdquo;, any visitor can report &ldquo;suspects&rdquo; to Adobe&rsquo;s &ldquo;policemen&rdquo; and &ldquo;prosecutors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But I learnt to my surprise that crime reports received at this Adobe website concerning such &ldquo;felonies&rdquo; are <strong>not</strong> surrendered to the real criminal police or to the real public prosecution, but on the contrary, these reports are kept secret by Adobe&rsquo;s in-house &ldquo;policemen&rdquo; and &ldquo;prosecutors&rdquo;. That is sort of schizophrenic, but what is more, the refusal to surrender crime reports received to official crime-prosecuting authorities is a crime in itself in many countries.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example for this bizarre behavior:</p>
<p>For more than ten years without interruption, a font forgery collection CD called &ldquo;Schriftenpaket Osteuropa&rdquo; has been sold in Europe. This CD is a forgery of the Adobe CD &ldquo;Font Folio&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For instance, today (27th April), this &ldquo;Schriftenpaket Osteuropa&rdquo; CD is being sold here:</p>
<p>[Links Killed by a moderator with nothing better to do.]</p>
<p>(Will Typophile moderators kill above links so that the police cannot see them?)</p>
<p>At my website, I documented this font forgery CD &ldquo;Schriftenpaket Osteuropa&rdquo; here</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/osteuropa1.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/osteuropa1.pdf</a></p>
<p>and pointed out the bizarre fact (see page 4 of above file) that Adobe&rsquo;s in-house &ldquo;policemen&rdquo; and &ldquo;prosecutors&rdquo; Charles Geschke, John Warnock, Thomas Phinney etc. have always refused to forward crime reports concerning this font forgery CD to official crime-prosecuting authorities.</p>
<p>Therefore it is sort of schizophrenic that Mr. Phinney declares in view of Prof. Luc Devroye (who also quoted my above documentation on this font forgery CD) that &ldquo;he should have been reined in years ago.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a university professor here in the U.S., and an amateur follower of copyright issues, I have to say that I agree McGill is within its rights to shut down any site it hosts <em>within</em> the parameters it sets forth for operating a site on its servers. By using one&rsquo;s server space, email, etc., to provide anything that network administrators and any other relevant authorities at the university determine is unacceptable, one is essentially violating a contract. And hence, one has no right to complain.</p>
<p>That said, any actions as drastic as shutting down a prof&rsquo;s site have to be conducted with something like due process; that&rsquo;s not only fair in the common-sense sense, but also usually a formal component of all such administrative processes. I.e., it&rsquo;s generally expected both culturally and officially.</p>
<p><em>That</em> said, this case has absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with &ldquo;academic freedom.&rdquo; At least in the States, and as a coordinator of a large chunk of courses, I am constantly running into abuses of the term. Academic freedom is about the right to speak on <em>political</em> issues freely in and out of the classroom without fear of professional retribution. The historical context involves people being summarily <em>fired</em> for having the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; political views (think of the &ldquo;Red Scare&rdquo; and the Cold War here in the U.S.). It doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;You can do whatever you want, and say whatever you want, and there won&rsquo;t be any consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are certainly cases in the States in which people have been asked to leave in what <em>appears</em> to be violation of academic freedom. But often these very same people are saying things that fly in the face of other important values in higher education, such as (a) promoting sound and reasonable research rather than lies, (b) maintaining an open and free educational environment rather than damaging this environment, and/or (c) bringing disrepute upon the institution for any number of reasons (e.g., the revelation of a prior criminal record or other damaging material that was not openly revealed during the hiring process).</p>
<p>Nevetheless, these are not black and white issues. So long live academic freedom and the debate about what it is. Not that this has much to do with typography&hellip;</p>

I&rsquo;m not an intellectual (surprise), but isn&rsquo;t socialism a sort of one-for-all and all-for-one kind of thing at it roots? If you take that to a possible conclusion: So, I have as much right to your work as you do, in an abstract way.</p>
<p>Oh well, my intentions weren&rsquo;t to stir another hornet&rsquo;s nest. Please forgive if I don&rsquo;t have a grasp of the concept. For a while I sort of bought into that kind of thing, but it definitely has issues, I can tell you that.</p>
<p>One that comes to mind is rewarding the lazy and punishing the productive. How long until a sense of unfairness manifests itself? Maybe some large groups of people are far more altuistic than myself. I guess if it is successful I can&rsquo;t argue with it.</p>

<p>What, is this flame-bait? Just a little potshot to show you&rsquo;re cleverer than me?</p>
<p>&lt;flameon&gt; You don&rsquo;t know me, you don&rsquo;t have any evident clue about the history of the term &ldquo;academic freedom,&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t understand what tenure actually involves (it&rsquo;s 99% granted by your <em>peers</em>, not some abstract authoritarian regime), and yet&hellip; you proclaim that my view is &ldquo;narrow.&rdquo; Moreover, it was quite plain in my post that I was <em>explaining</em>how things work more or less here in the States, and I ended on a note that clearly said &ldquo;long live the debate,&rdquo; which is about as open-minded as anyone can be.</p>
<p>Yawn.&lt;/flameoff&gt;</p>
<p>Back to typography, please.</p>
<p>P.S. I like Canada. I have relatives in Canada. Canada&rsquo;s social and political system is appealing. What more can I say?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uh, I actually don&rsquo;t give a damn what people put on their web sites. If some professor at McGill wants to reproduce copyrighted images of hot chicks squirming in front of a camera, I frankly don&rsquo;t care. Maybe if they were my daughter, that&rsquo;d be another story. Then again, if my daughter ended up in a porno mag, well, we&rsquo;d probably have to have a father-daughter discussion about that.</p>
<p>Anyway, if I judge my peers, it&rsquo;s on the quality of their work. But if I&rsquo;m working for an organization that pays me my paycheck, despite all of the checks and balances I expect to operate, and despite all of the freedom of thought and expression I&rsquo;d expect to enjoy, if I put stuff up on the site that violated a pre-existing rule I&rsquo;ve tacitly or explicitly agreed to about what&rsquo;s acceptable, then tough nuts for me.</p>
<p>I could of course argue my case, and perhaps even take my university to court. But I couldn&rsquo;t summarily dismiss their right to act on their intepretation of the situation and applicable rules any more than I&rsquo;d expect them to simply pull the plug on my site.</p>
<p>But perhaps, because this is a flame-exchange, you were making a sneaky comment about the quality of my own site? In other words, if I expected to get tenure on the quality of my site (which you can access via my profile), and my site really sucked, then I&rsquo;d better be careful before judging others on the basis of their sites? Now <em>that</em> would have been a clever jab. For you would have been insulted not only me, but also my hounds! <em>They</em> insisted I put their picture up there, even though it kinda ruins the balance of things.</p>
<p>This still has nothing to do with academic freedom, though. And little to do with fonts, either.</p>

<p>I did not refer to the quality of your site. That&rsquo;s one area I&rsquo;m not qualified to discuss. And I didn&rsquo;t take any personal jabs at you at all, so my apologies if you were offended &ndash; my intention was to argue that academic freedom is not required for the &ldquo;company men&rdquo; but especially for the avant-gardes or shitditurbers.</p>
<p>As for the &ldquo;contract&rdquo; or &ldquo;pre-existing rule&rdquo;: here you should investigate more. McGill is a public university, not a private institution. No rule it could make, or any contract it would be party to, could deprive its employee of a protected right. Taking down the entire site was a serious infringement.</p>
<p>But you were right about the process (not &ldquo;due process&rdquo; - your constitution has territorial limits) - any disciplinary measure or enforcement of policy that infringed on Luc&rsquo;s rights would require a fair hearing at the first opportunity. That&rsquo;s why I believe that Luc would win an apology. Can we be friends now?</p>

The people that download that kind of stuff are probably not good designers anyway. So if they do download it and lets say make &lsquo;something&rsquo; with it- you know it&rsquo;s gonna look like crap. Nobody hires crappy designers and they will soon be out of the job. It will collect dust in there seven year old windoze-me boxes and nothng will become of it. So there :)</p>

<p>And here is a quote from my Luc Hall of Fame page:</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;ve often heard it said that one measure to judge the vitality and quality of life of a university or a locality is its library, particularly by its available reference library in general and reference librarians in particular. If that is indeed the case then the typographical community is doing very well indeed thanks to the wonderful work of Luc Devroye. It did not take me long, after first discovering it many years ago, to realize that venturing anywhere else on the Web for information regarding anything to do with typography was absolutely pointless. Search engines, commercial and free font sites, friends recommendations etc&hellip;.nothing has ever turned up via any other source that isn&rsquo;t somehow documented and reviewed by Luc.</p>
<p>It has been such a time saver to read his expert abstracts and distilling of the information offered by other sites. His site has not tried to push any particular viewpoint down the visitors' throat, rather it has encouraged and enabled all to explore and learn about a subject so rich in history. In this age on information overload, where conflicting statements on the Web are presented as the &ldquo;gospel truth&rdquo; by a variety of site authors, it is comforting to know that there is always one refuge you can go to where there is no agenda other than the love of type. In addition, one could never find a site better maintained; in all my many hundreds (thousands??? <g>) of trips to it I can never recall when it has not been updated within the previous 24 hours. That, to me, is dedication supreme.</p>
<p>Does Luc warrant inclusion in the &ldquo;Hall Of Fame&rdquo; pages?? They would be the &ldquo;Hall Of Shame&rdquo; pages if he were left out. To Dr. Devroye I can only say thank you, thank You.” - Mark Johansson</p>

<p>If a designer needs to purchase a font(s) to complete a project for a client don&rsquo;t you just charge the client for it or use your advance funds? When you are brainstorming or reviewing proofs with a client don&rsquo;t you discuss costs for things that satisfy the client?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see a need to steal if you are in fact a professional. If you work for a bureau/design firm coming up with cost estimates for the client always includes moneys that are to be allocated for spending on needed supplies (such as fonts)?</p>

<p>The concept of &ldquo;freedom of speech&rdquo; allowes me to publish in a form where I can express my ideas. If Luc provides links to illegal downloadable copies of my book, which is copyrighted and protected in that regard, he has every right to do so.</p>
<p>It is the violator of my rights in this regard, the illegal copier who is my concern (and who is liable for his/her actions), not someone who provides information in the form of links. In fact, Luc&rsquo;s link would be of great benefit to me. Over the eight year publishing duration of this book, three &ldquo;cease and desist&rdquo; complaints have been issued, all of them to institutions.</p>
<p>The flip side of this of course is the would be consumer. If you prefer to steal the fruits of other folks efforts, rather than pay for them, that ultimately, is your problem.</p>

<p>Even if you think you&rsquo;ve been harmed, it is important to appear civil and reasonable. Otherwise you will instigate what I call the &ldquo;Treacy Effect&rdquo;. Which is that even people who agree with him want to see his whole offering spread far and wide as a sort of cosmic retribution.</p>
<p>The people who can make their point without getting nasty have much more influence over me. It was just such an appeal in the Usenet group years ago (who it was, I don&rsquo;t know) that got me to see the other side of the downloading issue.</p>
<p>And it also had the side-effect of giving me a sense of freedom, since without having to have every font made by everyone, it was much easier to manage the whole affair.</p>
<p>Now I pretty much just dump my fontplays in there and very little else. I perhaps flatter myself by thinking someone will see that nice things can be done with free fonts, and it could help free them too.</p>

<p>The same could be said about Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe: their positive contribution to digital typography is immense, but at the same time their practice of font bundling &ldquo;does harm to type designers&rdquo; and &ldquo;should have been reined in years ago&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely true, Fontplayer. How do you suggest dealing with a situation where anyone who suggests that stealing music or fonts is labelled a spoil sport and ought to lighten up?</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an accident that where music theft is rampant that the current music is pretty poor also. When money is tight, companies won&rsquo;t take the risk of developing new artists the way they used to to, so it is difficult to get anything but lowest common denominator stuff into the market place. I&rsquo;m not saying this is the whole story behind the failure of the record companies to nurture talent, but I do think it is part of it.</p>
<p>And suppose I am right. Then music theft has led to a great decline in the quality of music, and the crushing of a lot of talented musicians out there. So when both music and musicians are hurt, I don&rsquo;t think &lsquo;lighten up&rsquo; is on target. But how do you make the point ?</p>

<p>My feeling is the reasonable people will respond to politeness and a patient explanation. The unreasonable people will ignore you regardless. But at least the reasonable people will be affected and the unreasonable people won&rsquo;t step it up a notch just to spite you.</p>
<p>With nastiness, in no time at all you can be drawn into &ldquo;Who is the Biggest Idiot&rdquo; contest with the unreasonable. And some of the reasonable people will even take pot-shots at you because you are such an easy target.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I want to add two comments:</p>
<p>First, Luc&rsquo;s site can be credited with introducing me to typography. Yet until this debate, I was NOT EVEN AWARE that he had links to pirated fonts.</p>
<p>Second, some people confuse the state of things as they like it to be with the law. The fact that I (and most everyone else here) wish to see designers justly rewarded for their work, doesn&rsquo;t make IP rights in type design come to life. For example, downloading copyrighted music is legal in Canada (and it ain&rsquo;t &ldquo;theft&rdquo; anywhere on the planet, because the original owner is not dispossessed of anything), and &ndash; unfortunately for designers &ndash; merely downloading your fonts is legal too (using them for certain purposes might be a different matter). So if downloading is not a violation of copyright, certainly posting the links is legal.  Now, you can make a moral case, but others could make the opposite case &ndash; and that brings us back to the question of free speech and academic freedom.</p>

<p>Uploading in Canada is illegal, but downloading not, your courts ruled. The issue isn&rsquo;t whether music sharing is theft of intellectual property, but who is the thief.</p>
<p>Also in the Canadian parliament a law was introduced to change the situation&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know what its status is.</p>
<p>Here is what is happening:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How has file sharing affected the Canadian recording industry?</p>
<p>In Canada, the Canadian Recording Industry Association estimates losses to the Canadian industry at about $250 million in sales over the past three years. That&rsquo;s a 20 per cent drop in annual sales. This is despite the Canadian Private Copying Collective, which was formed in 1999 to offset royalties lost to digital file sharing. The CPCC taxes hardware and software that allows digital recordings, whether or not they are being used for music. It then distributes the money to composers, performers, publishers and record labels. The CPCC collected $28 million in 2000 and 2001. There is no similar program in the U.S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you still think no harm is done to musicians? And that the practice of file sharing is legal?</p>
<p>And facilitating an illegal process that harms people&ndash;uploading rights protected material&ndash;is moral? You say there is a case to be made for its morality: What is that case?</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>I made a legal distinction between copyright infringement and theft. In your eyes they are equivalent because of your commendable agenda, but legally they differ. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no desire to argue about IP policy in Canada. The issue extends far beyond your commercial interests, and I haven&rsquo;t formulated an opinion. However:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again, that Luc couldn&rsquo;t have violated Canadian copyright law by posting links to material the downloading of which is legal. Hence, McGill could not have shut down his website on IP grounds.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Otherwise, I don&rsquo;t want to be dragged into an argument where you portray me as the bad guy simply for challenging the assumptions shared by you and your colleagues.

<p>It is considered by many to be a luxury or indulgence. As a musician, I have had my spirit wounded when I am at a club to see one of the world&rsquo;s greats, and they are being ignored by two-thirds of the people who consider it background music. Small wonder some club owners would choose to play canned music rather than pay a good group to play.</p>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t have a creative bone in their body, and wouldn&rsquo;t mind if Algerian were the only display face, Arial the only sans and Times New Roman the only serif fonts.

<p>Typequake, I asked you for an argument for the morality of downloading, when uploading is illegal and hurts people. I think that&rsquo;s a reasonable question, not bullying, since you yourself stated that there is such a case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since when do recording companies promote musicians? I tought they just slapped play backs on top models and sold the product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that the record companies spend millions on promoting the likes of Britney Spears. That they don&rsquo;t invest in developing talented new artists and instead rely on the odd breakthrough from independent, underfunded artists is the problem. My guess is that the financial pinch has made them more risk averse, which is bad for art.</p>
