  body: "hi,\r\n\r\nI think it isn\u2019t Vonness, have a look at the E.\r\n\r\nLooks
    like Bauer\u2019s Venus, which was a source of inspiration for Vonness, but I
    can\u2019t find a bold version (besides the bold extended). See the medium at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/de/388043/sgvenussbmedium-schrift.html"

  body: "I\xB4ve looked through several fonts, but find this one very tricky. It is
    possible to flip through the magazine (www.lemagazinedouble.com), and I found
    a thinner version..or at least that was wat I first thought..but the R is different.
    So I haven\xB4t figured it out yet. Thanks for all the help, it is much appreciated:)"
