body: "Can anyone help me identify this stencil type used on the 'Rosa Muerta' house?\r\n\r\nThe
  'M' seems very specific to this version of what appears to be a common version of
  stencil lettering, which makes it tough for me to figure out.\r\n\r\nI'd love to
  find out -- any help is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere's the house:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.latimes.com/features/home/la-hm-rosamuerta-pg,0,5926081.photogallery\r\n\r\nand
  I have a specific pic attached with the type example below."

  body: Probably hardware store stencil letters, and not a digital font. Not sure
