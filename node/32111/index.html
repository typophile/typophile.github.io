<p>I really like the &ldquo;bravado&rdquo; - to me this is a more charming Cooper Black. I&rsquo;d like to find out what it&rsquo;s called and who made it (the pinmark was no help: it&rsquo;s just a thin straight vertical line in a circle) but most of all I just wanted to share it. The label on the drawer says &ldquo;Old Style Grotesque&rdquo;, which is of course completely uniformative and probably incorrect.</p>

<p>American Type Founders commonly used a pinmark of a circle with a &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; line running through it. The ancient astronomical symbol for earth. I guess one could assume this typeface was originally an issue by one of the foundries ATF gobbled up with the consolidation. And then later dropped from the line, likely by the 1920s.</p>

<p>Yes, the script by Bosco.</p>
<p>But based on other fonts  (around that time) &ndash;  Apolo,  Cleopatra, Olympian, Petrarka, Pretorian &ndash; maybe Romany is the original name.</p>
<p>However, you can find different fonts with the same name (again, around that time): Venezia &ndash; decorative/display font by Brendler &amp; Sons (Vienna), and the text font &ndash;  George Jones/ Edward Prince (London)</p>

<p>But . . . I did find it in my 1926 Stephenson, Blake &amp; Co. specimen. It&rsquo;s titled <em>Lining Romany</em>. (Many of the SB fonts from this period are hyped as &ldquo;lining,&rdquo; meaning they are cast on the American Point Line system &ndash; still a fairly new concept over there at that time, I think.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s offered in 60, 36, 30, 24 18, 12, 10, and 8 point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that there are several SB designs that seem to have come over from the States and acquired new names (for instance, Chippendale = Pencraft), but there are also a few that may have traveled the other direction (Munder Roman = Verona?). So, it&rsquo;s hard to say whether this particular design originated with Stephenson Blake or not, and whether there might be an American equivalent, or even a predecessor.</p>

Also, I feel that letterpress (which btw can now be done with plates made from digital files) does have some subtle advantage, and actually I think it might be from the avoidance of extreme crispness! I have an idea of how to replicate that in offset, but it&rsquo;s sort of far-fetched. I also wonder whether at the tail end of photosetting (where presumably the blur had become tamed if not eradicated) this subtle softness was also present (except digital was already making photosetting practically obsolete).</p>
<p>Another reason metal sorts seem to look better might be that they don&rsquo;t form actual readable words, hence leave our imagination to embelish the abstract; sort of how a person generally looks more attractive from a distance!  :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The ink film in letterpress is physically thicker on the paper and impresses more into the paper fibers. Offset has a wash cleansing of extra residue from the plate and a second transfer from plate to blanket which further thins the ink that hits the paper. This allows for finer detail and less need for trapping but the thickness of ink is less. The effect is greater on noncoated paper which is more typical of books than slick mags. Web presses can get overly washed sometimes too so even coated stock impressions can be a bit anemic. As usual, a good pressman is required no matter what method is used.</p>

Few printers are willing and able to produce a good black without making the type something the type designer never intended (ergo: worse, in general).</p>
<p>BTW, it&rsquo;s tempting -and probably intuitive- to think that the blacker the
better, but I think there&rsquo;s definitely such a thing as too much contrast.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to hear more from press men (or women) with experience of both kinds of printing to corroborate your view, Chris.</p>
<p>To me, the deep velvety black of letter press is the main gorgeous thing about it, even more than the &lsquo;sock&rsquo; into the paper. The contrast of that flat almost shiny black against rougher, matte paper that disperses light, rather than reflecting also contributes to readability, I think.</p>

In terms of &ldquo;blacker&rdquo;, I could not say without some sort of densitometer reading. The effect of blacker on the page is often, as Hrant mentions above, due to overinking and the inkspread that it causes. Too much packing is another culprit. It forces deeper impression and even rounding of type. 
The other issue is that often text faces that started in metal and later were made for photo or digital, didn&rsquo;t adjust for weight difference in inkspread when the transition was made and therefore seem lighter on the page.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a copy of the 1844 revival of Caslon, &lsquo;Lady Willoughby&rsquo;s Diary&rsquo;. It was not only celebrated at the time, and led to the wider revival of Caslon, but also much later shown in exhibitions as an example of superb printing. It has more consistency and less distortion of the letters than in Caslon&rsquo;s own 1766 sample book&ndash;no doubt because of superior inks and printing technology of time. Its text is in a beautiful black against the woven matt paper, which incidentally looks not aged at all over 150 years later.</p>
<p>I am not a printer, but I have printed letter press and was taught about over inking, and I do not agree that a deep black indicates over-inking. I think it is a feature of good, properly inked letter press. But as I say, I want to learn more about the differences on between offset and letter press from knowledgeable printers.</p>
<p>As of now I find Chris&rsquo;s analysis plausible.</p>

<p>I would go for this. And further, I think the act of imagining is enjoyable. And also what mystery still left is enjoyable &amp; pleasant too as long as it seem promising.</p>
<p>I have a theory about letterpress ink which is that it may have less ( because it needs less) lacquer or other shiny binders. A smooth paper has less &lsquo;tooth&rsquo; and is less spongy. Offset tends to use a smoother paper. A paper like that would shed ink morer easily and need more binder + plus we expect more technical perfection/performance from offest which would make you use more binder maybe. Binders will tend to shine, so the less binder, laquer/glue/whatever; the blacker the ink can look. The more matte the black the darker it can look.  It could also be that the paper used in offset sucks more the binder deeper into the paper leaving a more matte result even when the same ink is used. What do you think?</p>
<p>Nice thread guys!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, what about consistency of letterform? When you say it was a &ldquo;revival&rdquo;, do you mean just of printing with Caslon, or of the fonts themselves? I ask because Caslon&rsquo;s forms exhibit a lot of inconsistency (which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily bother me within a font, but definitely bothers me across sizes - unless it&rsquo;s something like Neuland, where I feel it&rsquo;s actually a plus).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not agree that a deep black indicates over-inking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say it was unavoidable or inherent. But when you printed letterpress yourself, did you manage to get that great black while maintaining letterform integrity? Unlikely, and not necessarily because you were -I&rsquo;m presuming- just dabbling: it&rsquo;s very hard; even qualified people who want to do it (which is sadly rare) have trouble.</p>
<p>My point wasn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s not possible, it was that it&rsquo;s very rare. On average, in practice on the ground, offset tends to arrive at a better balance of blackness and letterform integrity; it&rsquo;s simply a lot harder to mess it up.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you must have seen some offset printed with &ldquo;rich black&rdquo; (black that&rsquo;s made with some C, M and Y, not just K) on thick coated paper: it&rsquo;s pure lustre. Which is not to say I admire it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; as long as it seem promising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the elaboration that I guess it depends on whether you&rsquo;re a positivist or a cynic. When the crow gets the grapes instead of you, do you think &ldquo;damn it&rdquo;, or do you think &ldquo;they were probably sour anyway&rdquo;? :-)  You guys should hear all the variants on that Æsop fable that my brother and I once came up with!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we expect more technical perfection/performance from offest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and I think this extends beyond tangible things like binder; we expect letterpress to be imperfect in some ways, so we ignore that, or even turn it into something commendable.</p>

It was always large solids, usually reverses and, most typically. where a photo was knocking out of solid black and the one-color black looked dead next to the 4-color build. Large solids sometimes were given a double-hit when you wanted real density. It is hard to give large solids enough ink on highspeed presses&ndash;mostly if there is a lot of it. The ink gets eaten up before it has a chance to replenish. Often, jobs with big solids were reimposed so that the big solid was at the back of the sheet, distributed throughout, or flipped to avoid all the ink on one half getting sucked up. Computerized presses today have a much easier time of it though since they have more exacting control.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On the 1844 Caslon, it was I believe the first time any typeface had been revived, and that before that old matrices and punches were either lost or stored, but not reused after they went out of popularity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether any new punches were cut for the 1844 revival, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure almost all of it is old&ndash;either old type or cast from the original matrices.</p>
<p>On consistency of letter form, are you just asking about this across sizes?</p>
<p>Across sizes, there is a lot of variation, but much of it is very intelligently done, and for good reasons. He didn&rsquo;t vary with optical size in the way that Adobe does today, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean his way was necessarily worse. Also the way they did lay-out was different, so the comparison is not so easy.</p>
<p>I am convinced that because Caslon turned out so much type, he was always in a rush to get stuff out the door, and that explains some of the seemingly haphazard variation. But in my revival often when I have scoffed at something he did, and tried doing something different, it has come around to bite me later, when I get into trouble and see that the better solution is to do it his way.</p>
<p>Another part of the variation in Caslon may well come from his using as a starting model for his fonts Dutch types from different hands. But to find all this out would be a long research in itself, which I haven&rsquo;t done.</p>
<p>On my own printing, I did this as a teen and it was definitely amateurish, so that is not my basis for comparison. One of the first things I was told, though, is that over-inking is more of a problem than under-inking.</p>
<p>A bit part of the problem with digital type revivals, IMHO, has been copying the metal of the classics rather including the ink spread so as to be suitable for offset. However, I am thinking there is an issue also with ink. But this is just a hypothesis to be confirmed or not by those who actually can give an expert opinion. If there is a problem, then it would raise the interesting question of how offset could be improved&ndash;by new inks, processes or, eg. tupper&rsquo;s suggestion above.</p>

<p>Generally across the board yeah, perhaps contemporary letterpress doesn&rsquo;t make the grade, but then, so doesn&rsquo;t the majority of offset work.</p>
<p>Examples of exemplar?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d think that high-end commercial letterpress prior to the Great Depression years was about as clean and crisp and black as it could get without the need for noticeable impression. A readily example would be the 1923 ATF specimen book and other type specimen books of the period. Those machines, processes, techniques, and men are, alas, long gone.</p>
<p>Still you might find it hard to make your case in examining the work of post-war fine press printers such as Victor Hammer or Lewis Allen, et al (and even some contemporary fine printers), where controlled impression on dampened handmade paper results in letterforms that are crisp and darkest black and without ink spread. And a breath-taking marvel to behold.</p>
<p>The deep black of letterpress isn&rsquo;t dependent upon the film thickness, but rather the ink coloration, the technique of application, and the materials of production. And, of course, the rationale of the pressperson. In this regard, it&rsquo;s good enough, isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Gerald, thanks for addressing this. For starters, is the ink used for letter press different from ink used in offset?</p>
<p>I have a lot of other questions: Can you describe more what gets a good deep black in letter press? Do you think you can get the same look from offset, or that offset is inherently limited? How?</p>
<p>I just turned up an old 50x magnifier I had been missing. I looked at the 1844 &lsquo;Lady Willoughby&rsquo; Caslon printing. Two things suprised me. First, inspite of the velvety black to the naked eye, at 50x there is a lot of white fiber showing through in the black area&ndash;I guess it wasn&rsquo;t over inked! Second, I can see a clearly defined fine white line where the edge of the metal type hit, and the ink spread beyond it. Cool!</p>

<p>Not to be contrary, but I think to compare letterpress and offset is sort of like comparing apples to oranges. Yes, the inks are different, as are the processes. On the other hand, there are no old formula letterpress inks still available. Most letterpress folks today do use offset inks. I use stone lithographic (printmaking) inks in printing my letterpress work, though they too would be quite different than commercial offset inks.</p>
<p>That said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I can adequately explain in words how one gets the deep black in letterpress (without accompanying ink spread). At least I&rsquo;m not up for it tonight. It&rsquo;s a combination of a number of material factors combined with a theoretical approach to printing. Bit pretentious I suppose, but I think accurate.</p>
<p>But what you are seeing through the loop is inadequate film lay on the letterform. The fibers of the paper are showing through. Not uncommon.</p>
<p>The white line is due to the wrong tack/flow of the ink or incorrect roller pressure or wrong printing height (this isn&rsquo;t necessarily an impression problem though it could be as well). Or a combination of one or the other or all three. The ink film is being pushed or squeezed off the letterform. You are seeing separation of pigment and carrier. Not so cool actually. To correct this, one would have to start all over. Not always an option to the commercial printer.</p>

<p>Gerald, have you ever looked at type under 50x magnification?</p>
<p>Checking on line, a magnifying glass is 2x to 4x. A jeweler&rsquo;s loupe is usually 10x. A low setting on a  microscope is 40x. The 50x magnifier I looked through is on a microsopic level, more powerful than a magnifying glass or jeweler&rsquo;s loupe.</p>

<p>Not certain of the intent of the question, and I assume 50x would reveal mites on a mite, but I can truthfully say I have never looked at type at 50x. But I also don&rsquo;t use a loop, don&rsquo;t need too. I have very bad eyesight. I don&rsquo;t have focus much beyond the eyeball. So, basically, I have microscopic vision (without my trifocals—which I really like a lot). I suppose in ancient times I would have been consigned to carving minutia, if so lucky. And, likely, I would have been very happy doing it.</p>

<p>I wanted to ascertain whether you might have mistakenly thought these effects would be evident to the naked eye, and hence your comments on &lsquo;inadequate film lay on the form&rsquo; and &lsquo;incorrect pressure&rsquo; might not be correct.</p>
<p>I do think that the &lsquo;Lady Willoughby&rsquo;s Diary&rsquo;, which as I said was held up as an example of good printing, is in fact well done. Because of the beautiful black in this book, I don&rsquo;t think it is under-inked.</p>
<p>With my rediscovered toy, I have now also looked at my 1924 specimen book from the Caslon foundry, printed by George W. Jones, and my 1928 Caslon specimen book from Linotype, and some offset printing.</p>
<p>I suspect from its look and its date and the fact that Jones was reknowned as an excellent printer that you would regard this specimen as a fine printing job. Again, you can see some whiter fibers in the inked area, though less so than in the Lady Willoughby book. Another interesting  difference that I see, though, is that in the Lady Willoughby the print seems to have flattened the fibers of the paper more, without &lsquo;embossing&rsquo; the page. This flatness I think partly accounts for the beautiful black to the naked eye. (Both are printed on laid paper, with the ribs being more prominent in the unprinted part of the Lady Willoughby paper as compared to the Jones booklet.)</p>
<p>Because in the front note they refer to the &ldquo;style of printing&rdquo; being suited to the antique setting, I am guessing that the paper might have been dampened before printing, old style. This might also account for the clearly etched white line indicating the outline of the metal face. By the way, my &lsquo;cool&rsquo; comment is about being able to clearly see Caslon&rsquo;s original outlines in this book, under the 50x magnification.</p>
<p>Someone here has also pointed out the relatively white line appearing in an &lsquo;averaging&rsquo; process done on Aldus&rsquo;s pages. And I know that Carol Twombly for her Caslon revival also used the white line, seen under magnification, to try to identify Caslon&rsquo;s original metal outlines&ndash;which she didn&rsquo;t follow however.</p>
<p>In the 1928 specimen book there is printing on both coated and &ldquo;antique&rdquo; paper. The &lsquo;antique&rsquo; paper printing looks similar to the Jones specimen book, but the coated paper is an interesting contrast. There is much more paper show-through where the metal struck, and a surrounding blacker line where ink-spead took place. (This is not evident to the naked eye.) In general the 20&rsquo;s printing looks like it &lsquo;soaked&rsquo; around the fibers of the rough paper more, but is not as flat as the Lady Willoughby.</p>
<p>I have also just looked at some modern offset type on woven, matte paper. It is strikingly different. Under this low power microscope, it looks a bit like granite, with grey and black flecks throughout.</p>
<p>It is certainly greyer than the old letter press examples. So whatever the cause, I was not hallucinating about letter press being blacker.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether the &lsquo;granite&rsquo; effect of offset is because of a lighter &lsquo;kiss&rsquo; of the paper or thinner inks, but the granite effect, and hence greyer look is definitely there.</p>
<p>I should say that it is a little tricky using this little magnifier, and some of what I see as white may be reflections of light instead of white fibers. But I think what I just reported is basically accurate.</p>
<p>Finally, the processes of letter press and offset are, as you say, clearly different. But the <em>result</em> is in both cases is ink on paper, in little letters, and so the comparison under magnification I think tells us something interesting about the causes of difference in appearance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You can never underestimate the skill of the craftsman doing the work. The good ones took such pride in printing superb pages. I don&rsquo;t know that we will ever see that kind of work again. 
Papers do differ, even when they generally look the same. This can account for the differences. When you noticed &ldquo;flattened the fibers&rdquo; this could be either due to dampening the paper or just the nature of the paper. Dampened paper (IMHO) is less likely to spring back and tiny fibers are more likely to be firmly emulsified in the ink. It would take an expert examining your samples to tell what was going on so don&rsquo;t take what I say as anything but speculation.</p>
