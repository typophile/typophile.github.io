body: "After the release of DTL FontMaster 2.7.0 a couple of months ago, a <em>Light</em>
  version is now available also from the <a href=\"http://www.fonttools.org\">DTL
  FontTools</a> web site.\r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/english/Release.html#release_FM\">here</a>.
  FM 2.7.0 supports the AFDKO 2.0 (already an update is in production that will support
  the latest AFDKO version 2.5, like DTL OTMaster does). \r\n\r\nThe kit for running
  the Windows version of FM in a 'Wine bottle' under CrossOver for OS X (actually
  X11) or Linux has been updated also. At the Dutch Type Library the 'Wine bottles'
  have proven to form very fast and stable environments for running FM.\r\n"
