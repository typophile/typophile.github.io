<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi <br> <br>curently I digitize a humanistic cursiv of Aldus Manutius. It is a lot of fun. What do you think should I go on? <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13176.gif alt="Aldus Italic"> <br> <br>Greets Jens</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Yes, you should go on. But i think you'd have to have an roman to go with it. <br> <br>I like the fatness of the type. And the way you digitized it. Although you'll hve to do a little about spacing and kerning. (you could try to base those on leadtype, no kerning?) If you want to claen the forms up, beware of not loosing of loosing the vitality it has now. <br> <br>For modern use, you might want to have a small 's' (or not!) <br> <br>--Jacques <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The small s is also traditional, and should be part of the font. It was used as a final s, and perhaps also as initial s - I don't remember. The long s was dropped after the French revolution, I believe. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the comments! <br> <br>to jacques: if i wanna make like Aldus the Caps has to be roman. So he dont italiced the caps rigt? maby hav to try with the AdobeAldus... <br>Spacing and Kerning... hmmm view my other typedesign and you will see this is one think that I really have to learn. But i will try also to overtoke it from the original. <br> <br>To William and jacques: Of course a "short s" comes... Are there chances to embed it with a Opentype feature? <br> <br>BTW: I must made many more ligatures for this. But what will happan if make somesthink like this: "fi" and "ie" What if both ligaturs are after another in one word?? <br> <br>Okay thanks for the comments... mabye some more? <br> <br>Greets Jens</div>

<div class=commentbody>Very nice, I enjoy its irregularity. Although "q" and long-"s" look exaggeratedly heavier than the other characters, to me. And "a" is too small? <br> <br>About your ligature question ("fi" and "ie"): maybe you should just design a "fie" ligature? ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is a beautiful design, and it has <br>quite a bit of potential. <br> <br>I don't think it needs a companion roman, <br>necessarily. Aldine italics were meant <br>to function independently. It's only relatively <br>recently that we have begun to pair them <br>with roman fonts. <br> <br>I also think that a bold version would go <br>against the spirit of the face. This design <br>could easily stand alone as either a text <br>or a display face. <br> <br>I agree with you that the caps should probably <br>take either a roman or sloped roman form. I'd <br>encourage you to try an upright roman first <br>for the caps to see how it works. <br> <br>I also agree that you should design a short "s" <br>for beginning and ending letters of words. <br> <br>As for ligatures, I say design as many as seem <br>to suggest themselves. You should definitely <br>include a full range of "f" ligatures ("fb", "ff", <br>"ffi", "ffj", "ffl", "fft", "fh", "fi", "fj", "fk", "fl", and "ft"), <br>as well as "c" ligatures ("ch", "ck", "ct", etc.) <br>and "s" ligatures with long and short "s". <br>You might also consider a "Th" ligature, <br>as well as ligatures for the article adjectives, <br>common prepositions and conjunctions <br>(The, "the", "An", "an", "Le", "le", "La", "la", <br>"El", "el", "From", "from", "And", "and", <br>"&c", "etc.", etc. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> ) <br> <br>I also wouldn't change the "a" very much, <br>as it looks nice to my eye, and seems to fit <br>the spirit of the Aldine italic. <br> <br>Best of luck. This could be a great font. <br> <br>David</div>

<div class=commentbody>I love that outsized S... sweet! I agree with David that a Roman isn't necessary. Just have fun and don't worry about what other people think you HAVE to have in it. Worry about what you want to have. If you want to have a bitmap of a rodeo clown as part of your font, do it up!</div>

<div class=commentbody>The way you have gotten the soft, antique look without lumpy outlines is great. Spacing seems to be a particular challenge with this style. Did the original have a lot of ligatures with the long 's'? These may be necessary for good spacing. </div>
