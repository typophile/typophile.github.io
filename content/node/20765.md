body: "The prime and double-prime (U+2032, U+2033 respectively) are supposed to be
  different from the acute accent (U+00B4), but not a single one of the several hundred
  expensive fonts I checked out has those two glyphs. I was wondering what other people
  do when they need primes or double-primes \u2014 do you go with one or two acute
  accents, do you create the glyphs yourself, or what?"

  body: if true prime marks are not available, i'd say that the singlequote (U+0027)
    and the double quote (U+0022) are your best approximations.

  body: In bookwork, prime and double prime are historically slanted characters; for
    this reason, generic single and double quote marks in roman fonts are incorrect.
    Because these characters are not ordinarily represented in text fonts, compositors
    correctly use characters from pi fonts, typically math pi fonts, for them. If
    you're including them in a text font, you should draw them at a slant, as if italic.
    Acute accents should never be used for these characters.

  body: "I agree, but the best solution I find is usually to use the italic versions
    of the \"typewriter quotes.\" The main problem with using a math pi font is that
    the weight may not match very well.\r\n\r\nThat being said, these should definitely
    be in more fonts. I've got them in the typeface I'm working on right now, fwiw.\r\n\r\nT"
