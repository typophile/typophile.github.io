body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI\xB4m doing a logo for a Jazz / Soul Band, named EC[easy]. This
  Jazz / Soul band is new and they haven\xB4t got any logo yet.\r\n\r\nMy problem
  is that I\xB4m stuck with my idea... So I wonder if anyone could give critiques...
  suggestions... for this logo.\r\n\r\nThe band itself doesn\xB4t have a logo and
  they asked me to make one. Something that describes in a few words: \r\n\r\n- new\r\n-
  soul\r\n- jazz\r\n- easy (EC)\r\n\r\nOther questions?\r\n\r\n- Is this logo proper
  for music industry and for a Jazz / Soul Band?\r\n- Is there some proper font that
  I instead could use to make an logo for the band?\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the band:
  \r\n\r\nhttp://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=166131331\r\n\r\nMany
  Thanks,\r\n\r\nTed"

    done does might suit a chamber music quartet but does not really suit this band's
    music. Also the way the letters join looks too much like an i."

  body: Being blunt, the designs so far look really clunky and forced. If you think
    about classic band logos, they are usually really simple ideas, which helps when
    you bear in mind the application - guitar picks, embroidered badges, school book
    doodles etc, in other words, it has to look good when really small, as well as
    really big and so far the ones on show wouldn't translate. Also, is the name of
    the band EC, or Easy? If it's EC, then why are the logos so far "easy"?

  body: Scrap the Helvetica font, so overused and I hate it. Totally the wrong font
    choice Jazz has a lot of swing to it, so maybe show this in the design. Maybe
    experiment with your own hand styles in illustrator. Or maybe get them down on
    paper and scan them into your workspace to work on them.

  body: "Too much. Way too much. Get rid of the splatter/stroke type. It doesn't serve
    a purpose. A great mantra...\"Keep it simple stupid\". I swear one day I am going
    to make myself a t-shirt so I can wear it while I'm working on projects. :) I
    am also plagued by the overwhelming want to put colors and colors and stuff everywhere...but...\r\n\r\nI
    think you are trying too hard. The cool thing (but hardest part) about design
    is that you are suppose to make it look effortless. It's suppose to look like
    you just sort of made it in a few minutes. But behind it all, there are hours
    upon hours of work and tweaking and kerning and frustration and then finally...SUCCESS!\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the swirl doesn't read as an e, it's reads as a swirl. I do kind of like how you
    have the top of the s sort of following the o. That's a nice little piece there.
    But step back a little and clean it up. Jazz is all about the off beat. (I have
    played instruments for about 12 years now, including some jazz) Jazz is about
    the energy. You can show those things without making the text do them. It's cool
    to see how you're working though.\r\n\r\ncourtney"

    styles, and changed it for each logo.\r\n\r\ncourtney"

  body: "Hmm, 4 & 6 of JPG 10 have some potential. I still say get rid of the outlines
    around the type. If you like this font, you can always go into illustrator ->
    type-> create outlines. This will make the type into vector shapes. Then you can
    select \"expand\" from the top tool bar. This will make it to where you can go
    through and delete those stroke lines around the type.\r\n\r\nI do think it's
    going in a direction at least. I'd say put some effort into making it read \"Easy
    Soul\" and making it look clean and professional. You might end up with a fairly
    nice portfolio piece at the least.\r\n\r\ncourtney"
