  it was a well suited font for its use... but can't find a match for it... i've looked
  at a couple of 'college' fonts like hoboken high but aint having much luck.\r\n\r\nI
  apologize for the image quality but it was a screenshot from the animation."

    twice.\r\n\r\nI've tried these various searches already to no success... which
    is why i brought it to Typophile. I wouldn't want to waste peoples time without
    honestly looking for it myself first and running it through other 'font id' forums."

  body: "I think Jeff Levine's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/return-pass/|Return
    Pass]] may be a better alternative, since the R is the right style. All it needs
    (I think) is to add the serif to the arm of the E.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
