  this this morning and i&#39;m having a bit of trouble getting it just right. there&#39;s
  not much to it, but any help would be appreciated. Thnx <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42133.gif"

  body: Paul it would be nice if you could add some of the same fluidity/flow that
    is in the swash to the type. As it is the type feels very stiff. I&#39;m not sure
    I would space the letters in &#34;Season 2004&#34; and I would remove the bullet.

    already?

  body: i&#39;m sure that the Little League organization already has a logo, but that&#39;s
    not what this is for. i&#39;m trying to put together something snappy for our
    local clubs. I guess i forgot part of it. let&#39;s try this again... <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'I think what I was referring to as an existing Little League logo &#40;which
    reminded me of what you are doing here&#41; can be illustrated with these images:

    League Logo"> <BR> <BR>The following images represent some type treatments I think
    work well in this arena: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42162.jpg"

  body: Dude Paul Don&#39;t use the smalls version of the sanserif typeface you have
    selected. That typeface doesn&#39;t have a small caps version. <BR> <BR>I think
    that is the exact &#34;little league&#34; logo just strangly modified.

  body: I agree with David, just stick with all caps. <BR> <BR>The word spacing of
    &#34;Little League&#34; is too wide. <BR> <BR>I might also consider tightening
    the letter spacing in between L and e in League.  <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t stack
    Winslow looks more like an after thought and it will be difficult enough to make
    Little League feel more handlettered without adding a word over it. What if you
    put Winslow in the banner? Or maybe take a cue from the middle/bottom row image
    that Scott posted. <BR> <BR>The way the banner is attached to the e in League
    doesn&#39;t feel organic, it feels snapped on. The curve from the e to the banner
    is too stiff. Think in the third dimension. and again take cue from that middle
    image. The e should thin out and then go into the banner, as if it is waving.

  body: 'thanks for the tips, suggestions. <BR>i&#39;ll post what i&#39;ve got so
    far for some last minute comments. <BR>i was going for the baseball jersey look,
    that&#39;s why i did what i did. I was gonna use Nick&#39;s Team Spirit font,
    but I used that last year and it&#39;s a bit too cute for what i was going for
    this time around. Anyhow, I&#39;ve tried to incorporate your suggestions. If you
    could take a look again and lemme know whatcha think, I&#39;d appreciate it. thnx
    again! <BR> <BR>Oh and BTW, the official Little League logo &#40;as far as I know&#41;
    is the logo on the banner that the girls are holding. <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

  body: Paul could you try using a serif face for Season 2004 the san serif seems
    a harsh contrast to Little League.
