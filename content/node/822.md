body: I recently came across a &#34;Lots-o-Fonts For a Pittance&#34; CD that I&#39;d
  actually never seen before. Curious what was on it, I forked over the few bucks
  and discovered that it was full of Brendel Informatik fonts. <BR> <BR>I know what
  this company is about and, sure enough, I recognized lots of commercial clones as
  well as ripoffs of a few of the early shareware font folks. Plenty of just plain
  junk as well. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, there are about 14 fonts/families on the CD that
  caught my eye but which I don&#39;t recognize. I&#39;d like to occasionally post
  one for your ID perusal so as to learn of the original font where possible. <BR>
  <BR>The first is called Albany &#40;occasionally, the name comes into play in the
  form of a weak pun on the original font&#39;s name. Macbeth gets the name Hamlet
  on the CD for instance &#41;. The last line in my sample image uses a very similar
  font on the CD called Sirius. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13763.gif"
  alt=""> <BR>I know it looks like one mighty crappy font, but I can&#39;t help but
  wonder what a well done original might look like. I really like some of the basic
  letterforms. <BR> <BR>Earlier this year, Manfred Klein offered a creation of his
  called <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein03/index.htm"
  target=_top>HerdeckeSans</a> &#40;look toward the bottom under Text Fonts&#41; that
  surely had the same inspiration. Trying to research that name Herdecke online got
  me nowhere. <BR> <BR>Any ideas? <BR><br> <BR><br>

  body: According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is creating their version of "Andromeda"
    and being cloned as A775 Deco, which feature the same uppercase and lowercase
    character sets as the design of FontBank's Andorra plus more symbols/punctuation
    and international characters were added, which join numbers and some symbols/punctuation.   The
    font itself is finally appearing on "MegaFont XXL 3.0" (for home users) and "infiniType
    4" (for designers), which were both being released around May 27, 2014.

    called &#34;Andorra&#34;. Their notes &#40;back in the days when sources were
    acknowledged&#41; said this was based on a font called &#34;Andromeda&#34;. This

  body: Thanks for the comments Mike. Apparently BuyFonts.com has a license to distribute
    the FontBank fonts. They have a copy of the FontBank license agreement, I believe,
    on their site attributing these fonts and their copyrights to FontBank. Mine not
    to ask why, it&#39;s just nice to know somewhere they can be found. I still get
    a lot of ID requests that were fonts they had in their collection.  I wish I could
    also find someone distributing NovelFonts. That was another set distributed by
    Tiger Direct in the mid-90&#39;s in the Expresiv Ornate collection. Anyone know
    if they are still out there?

  body: I share your wish for online samples of that FontBank/Tiger <BR>/Expresiv/Castcraft
    crap if only for reference&#39;s sake. Would <BR>be very helpful. <BR> <BR>But
    the fact that it&#39;s not distributed anymore is a blessing <BR>to all those
    who designed the original fonts that were  <BR>swiped and sold by those knockoffers.

  body: Mike, <BR> <BR>That site apparently doesn&#39;t have anything for sale, and
    you&#39;ll notice that the Expresiv Ornate collection is not among them &#40;those
    were the NovelFonts&#41;. &#40;See Andorra in the Classic set?&#41;

  body: I provided the link as confirmation from the source that &#42;most&#42; of
    the Expresiv Fonts CDs &#40;via Tiger&#41; are, as he says, no longer available.
    <BR> <BR>I see now what you mean about the Ornate/NovelFonts. <BR> <BR>BTW, I
    mentioned the urgency I sometimes feel to hunt up the original font for a knockoff.
    Just last year you helped me via e-mail to ID <a href="http://www.casadyg.com/"
    target=_top>Casady &amp; Greene&#39;s</a> Gazelle as the original for a clone
    I had and liked very much. Now C&amp;G is gone. <BR> <BR>Thanks again. <BR><br>
