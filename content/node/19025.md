body: "Some time ago I bought a very old document from the 1920's on a second hand
  fair. I instantly fell in love with the used typeface and descided to scan it and
  make a font out of it. Intentionally I just wanted to use it as an excercise for
  future fonts, but meanwhile I've really put my teath in it.\r\n\r\nIn the attached
  PDF you'll find the original text from the document. This contains words with the
  'normal' s and the old German '[[long s]]'. My German is quite good, but I my backwords
  compatibility goes only back to 1995. So I don't know how the long s is originally
  used in German text. I couldn't find any structural grammar-rules in the text, because
  both s-forms are used in the same word. Sometimes only the normal s is used and
  not the long s.\r\n\r\nI want to make an OpenType Pro font that takes care of the
  historical grammar-issues when you activate the feature. Besides that it will be
  packed with cool ligatures that I'm going to make next. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  reference material, or can give me an insight in the 'long s'-fenomenia?\r\n\r\n<a

  body: Normally, long s ("medial s") is the standard form, our s ("terminal s") is
    used only at the end of words. In the Italian Renaissance some people only used
    long s, and I dimly remember that in Germany the rule was not only rather laxly
    upheld but actually different at one point.

  body: "The distinction between \u017F and s in German is really a spelling problem,
    and as such there won't be an automatic solution unless you plan to include a
    sizeable dictionary in your implementation... \r\n\r\nHowever, it's really only
    crucial for Blackletter. When using Antiqua for printing German, the short s has
    always been acceptable.\r\n\r\nSince you may still be interested, I'll try to
    explain the rules as far as I remember them.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out before, the
    basic idea is that \u017F comes at the start of a syllable, but s is written at
    the end.  (The \u017F in \u017Fp and \u017Ft is always counted as part of the
    following syllable, unless etymology indicates something else.) The problems are
    that sometimes \u017F can also come at the end of a syllable:\r\n\r\nIf the end
    of the syllable coincides with the end of a word, the end of a prefix, or the
    end of a constituent of a compound word, s must be used; these rules are applied
    to words of foreign origin, too!  If a silent vowel has been elided (e. g., ich
    wech\u017Fle, un\u017Fre) \u017F must be used. Before a suffix starting with a
    vowel, it's \u017F. If the suffix starts with a consonant, use s. Before d, k,
    m, n, w (in native German words, there are few such combinations not covered by
    earlier rules) s is used. In all other cases \u017F is used as the default.\r\n\r\nDoesn't
    seem to complicated, but in practice the issue can be quite subtle, for example
    transportieren (trans-portieren) vs. tran\u017Fkribieren (tran-\u017Fkribieren),
    or Wach\u017Ftube vs. Wachstube (slightly far fetched, but there are a few examples
    where the form of the s changes the meaning completely.)\r\n\r\nAbbreviation and
    hyphenation do not affect the choice of s. You have to base the orthography on
    that of the complete word.\r\n\r\n "

    about that.\r\n\r\nYou'd have to put in an entire dictionary and hypenation engine
    into the font.\r\n\r\nLigatures, for instance, are another trick. Not ever instance
    of \"fl\" is replaced by a ligature in German. \"Auflegen\", for instance. \"Auf\"
    is a prefix. Prefixes and root words are not connected by ligatures. Otherwise,
    it would be difficult to notice the gap. But with words like \"abfliegen\", an
    \"fl\" liagure should be used."

  body: "So in German text, you only substitute fi an no other ligature? This doesn't
    satisfy me. Same for Adobe's solution which requires that you activate dlig (discretionary
    ligatures) to get f-ligatures in German text ... [Side note: These language-dependent
    definitions would require that layout engines respect language tags which, to
    my knowledge, most of them don't do at the moment.]\r\n\r\nI am unhappy that no
    application yet supports proper substitution of f-ligatures and maybe long-s for
    German. Obviously this is the price of internationalization. And I am one of them
    who made a fuss about the earlier method of substituting f-ligatures everywhere,
    with typographically incorrect results at many places in a German text.\r\n\r\nBut:
    Taking f-ligature substitution (almost) completely out of liga is just the other
    extreme!\r\n\r\nA very simple solution for German typographers is:\r\nliga *should*
    substitute f-ligatures wherever they appear -- so, no additional lookups for German!
    If a typographer really cares, he can go through the text manually, place the
    cursor between two letter that shall *not* be ligated, and switch off the liga
    feature. Character styles may help.\r\nThe amount of work this requires is about
    the same as with Andreas Seidel's or Adobe's liga-implementation for German. Only
    difference is, corrections work the other way round ...\r\n\r\nIn German typesetting
    it is not nice, but does not harm either if f-ligatures are used at places where
    they are typographically \"wrong\". This is what has become common anyway -- because
    the software does the job. If we are honest, there are maybe a hand-full of German
    typographers who really care if an f-ligature is in place or not. My impression
    is that this hand-full of typographers are responsible for the just-as-unsatisfying
    solutions described at the beginning. I worry for this, because the \"solutions\"
    are even worse than the original problem which is something one can live with!
    And definitely is not to be addressed on font level.\r\n\r\n<strong>To non-German-speaking
    type designers: Just do it as you always did. Forget the talk about exceptions
    from German side. Dealing with these exceptions correctly is not to be solved
    on typeface but on application level (dictionary).</strong>\r\n\r\nKarsten\r\n"

    even standard in FontLab. The German language has a lot of f-ligatures (ff, ffi,
    ffl, ffj, fft, etc.) that have been forgotten in fonts for a long time. You had
    to buy an expert font an work through your whole text to replace these ligatures.
    My god!...\r\n\r\nI'm also a person to correct my text by hand, as long as we're
    not talking about a 200 pages thick book. ;-)  IMHO I think every typographer
    and/or typedesigner should apply 'the correct typographic rules' set an example
    for people. If they don't, who will! \r\nMost people nowadays rely too much on
    their software to do it right. Mostly this is not the case. Therefor I want to
    implement as much into my font as possible, so the machine does it right. \r\n\r\nIf
    you make a font for a specific language, the etymological- and grammatical issues
    should be respected and applied correctly. You can't just producte the rights

    Did you try to read German texts with these wrong ligatures (like au\uFB02iegen)?
    It doesn't work at all. The ligatures mostly appear inbetween compound words and
