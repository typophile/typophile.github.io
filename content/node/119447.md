    The image is really tricky. I can't tell if the corners are angled or not.\r\n\r\nIt
    reminds me of the [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/shop_product_images/703-94f43ce1a4d01b03b380064966a181b9/CTA1113_original.jpg|Criterion

    in question. The difference is, the type for The Beatles' thing has half and half.
    Rounded and angled corners."

    don't the origin of this sample. A t-shirt? Spanish language ('PAREDES' = walls)?
    Related to Criterion?\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dizajndesign/komu/a|Komu

      Maybe it's a soccer jersey?\r\n\r\n(On an unrelated note, when I solved the

      also solved the origin of [[http://typophile.com/node/83686|The Man Who Feel
      to Earth]]. It's on page 143 of [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811839818/|ABZ]].
      I should probably mosey on over to that post and share the news.)"

  body: You're definitely right Rob. I didn't remember you actually solved the Gomorrah
    one, was probably too obsessed by finding a digital alternative. And glad to read
    you also solved the one for The Man Who Feel to Earth, everything coming from
    the same book.
