body: "I saw this on a trip to the bronx zoo. It is massive. This is the story:\r\nAfter
  working for six years on that beautiful tiger logo, the graphic designer was standing
  outside the committee's office to approve the new logo. Just then his mouth dropped,
  when he noticed that he had forgotten the \"mountain\" in \"Tiger Mountain.\" \"Oh
  gosh! I am done for, they'll tear me into shreds, they'll eat me alive!\". Tearing
  out his dyed blue hair (this was the nineties), he turned to the only font that
  could meet this challenge. \"Papyrus! can you help me out, just this once, for old
  times sake!\" he cried out to the font sitting patiently in his pre-installed font
  folder. \" NO! you got yourself into this, use helvetica, he's a nice \"clean\"
  font (this was the nineties)\" papyrus snorted with a middle-eastern accent. Our
  designer lunged at Papyrus, and a glorious scuffle ensued. When the smoked cleared
  papyrus was stuffed and mounted neatly underneath the \"tiger\" logo. The Committee
  was thrilled \"We like what you did with mountain, perfect\" they squealed. Out
  of the corner of his eye our graphic designer noticed that the top of the \"t\"
  had been lopped off in the struggle. He let out a faint chuckle. And that is the
  story of how the \"t\" in the \"mountain\" of \"Tiger Mountain\" lost his head.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tiger_4138.jpg]"
