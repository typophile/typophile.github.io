  too complex for a logo but thought perhaps the text on it''s own and the pixel art
  just as part of my branding. Appreciate your thoughts! Any awesome ideas for incorporating
  undead without getting too gory? Thank you. '

  body: "It depends on the overall positioning of the company (are they trying to
    look casually cute, dry professional, cool and creative, etc..), but I think the
    third option is not bad at all. One option to simplify would be to keep the zombie
    color and trim it down to a skull/skinny face kind of shape, built out of a handful
    of pixels. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the type, here you can actually try something
    conventionally \"boring\" like Benton Sans. A naughty mark + a good traditional
    type may make for a good combination. At the very least you can always try bold
    condensed varieties, these tend to be less formal and may work for your purpose."

  body: "None of them really make me think \u2039web design\u203A at first glance.
    I like the third one because the logotype is simple and clear and the artwork
    is cute, but it also makes me think of the trend of modern games with retro graphics.
    It has the potential to look outdated (a bit ironic, being retro) or done to death
    after some time, but not necessarily."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback guys. I have been playing with some ideas, I tried
    the simple pixel skull thing but I don't have the skill to make it work I think.
    It looks very generic and I couldn't find a balance between simplicity and uniqueness.

    body: I really like the pixel skull comps you did, actually. I think you're pretty
      close there.

    thought I was being so clever... \r\nI will work on refining the pixel skull version
