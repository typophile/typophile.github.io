body: "I'm looking for a font similar to the one in the picture.  I figure the example
  is probably custom logo lettering but if anyone knows of something similar, that
  would be helpful.  Maybe a smoother version of it without the rough edges.  It's
  kinda got a brushy/comic feel to it but I don't really like the various comic fonts
  around the web.  I'm sorta looking specifically for that style where the different
  segments of the letters taper out to a rounded point like in the \"T\" and the \"H\"
  in the example.  Thanks in advance for any help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rocksmith

  body: "Hey Chris, I'm thinking you could make something like this using \"brush\"
    brushes for photoshop.  Most of the segments are straight so you would just need
    some straight(ish) brushes to compile into the letters, eventually upping the
    contrast for the hard edges.\r\n\r\nI did a quick search and these turned up:
    \r\nhttp://www.brusheezy.com/brushes?cat=splatters&psv=&sort=\r\n\r\nYou could
    also probably generate the necessary elements for this by doing a few swipes on
    paper with a very large marker and scanning those in.  This is actually the approach
    I would recommend.  After making a few, you might end up making whole letters,
    etc.\r\n\r\nGood luck, I'd be curious to se what you come up with.\r\n"

  body: "I am with Nickolas on this one. If you only need to set a couple of words
    you should definitely letter this yourself and who knows, you might enjoy it.\r\n\r\nBut
    instead of using Photoshop brushes, I'd recommend using Illustrator and some custom
    brushes, so you can tweak the shapes to your heart's content. If you have a Wacom
    this is even more fun!\r\n\r\nYou can find some 'brushy' brushes here:\r\n[[http://iceytina.deviantart.com/art/Tina-s-Streaky-Inks-51465990]]\r\n[[http://colorburned.com/2008/08/vector-freebies-paint-brushes-1.html]]\r\n[[http://colorburned.com/2008/08/vector-freebies-paint-brushes-2.html]]\r\n[[http://colorburned.com/2008/08/vector-freebies-paint-brushes-3.html]]\r\n[[http://colorburned.com/2008/08/vector-freebies-paint-brushes.html]]\r\n[[http://nextexile.deviantart.com/art/Artistic-Brushes-Pack-1-64540416]]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yeah, I was afraid of that.  I was hoping to get the whole alphabet as a font
    so I wouldn't have to actually draw each character myself, however it looks like
    that's the way it might have to be!

  body: "Seb makes a good point, if made with illustrator i it would be easier to
    tweak, and nice and scalable.  Thanks for the links as well.\r\nSo I got into
    trying to see if there is a font actually out there, and I found this thing which
    I'm almost embarrassed to post: http://www.fontage.com/pages/aarcover.html\r\nIt's
    painfully ugly, but it does have a similar vibe."
