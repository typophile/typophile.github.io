<p>I suspect that some notion of &ldquo;anticipated audience&rdquo; is the right answer. I have to go &amp; look up the Unicode index for most characters in Latin A, B, or Extended Additional. It is easier to remember the Unicode of the combining diacriticals, so as a keyboard user, it would be a plus for me to be able to key the base glyph &amp; the Unicode for the diacritic. There are also written forms of languages where there are no precomposed Unicode characters (for example, many orthographies for Native American languages in a written form, using the Latin Alphabet) &ndash; if you want to support those, you need ccmp.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, maybe, it depends on how they look &ndash; the link shows bad spacing. But ccmp, as I understand it, addresses single glyphs, whether in Unicode or not. As I see it, there are two uses. The first is simply ease of entering a character, so that to enter w + grave, I can enter &ldquo;w&rdquo; plus &ldquo;U+0300&rdquo; rather than look up the Unicode for &ldquo;wgrave&rdquo; in Latin Extended Additional. The second use is is for glyphs made up which are not in Unicode as a single character, but have been made up in the font, such as e+macron+ogonek. If the glyph is in the font (&amp; in ccmp), then entering the Unicode string will call the character.</p>
<p>I think it impossible to anticipate all audiences. The latest manuscript we&rsquo;ve been contacted about involves &ldquo;scribal marks&rdquo; over letters; the author indicates these are not diacriticals. How can a foundry anticipate that sort of thing? Or different orthographies for Lakota, Navajo, etc.?</p>

<p>After further exploration of Igbo and Yoruba languages, which use subscript accents, it seems that the examples on the UN site are not properly Unicoded.</p>
<p>The subscript accent is supposed to be a short vertical line, not a cross or &ldquo;T&rdquo; shape.</p>
<p>The texts are set with the intent of working with negative-width, backspaced accents, but it doesn&rsquo;t come out right.</p>
<p>Yoruba is spoken by 20 million people in SW Nigeria, uses the latin alphabet, and is an official language use in schools, newspapers, etc.</p>
<p>Not a big font market, but there are many languages that use the Latin alphabet, so it should be possible to have a standard or best-practice system of applying accents using Unicode. I&rsquo;m sure people have been wrestling with this for years, so perhaps it&rsquo;s really not something for a general-interest independent foundry to get invovled with.</p>

<p>Well, Miguel Sousa called scholarly publishing a &ldquo;specialty market.&rdquo; The point I was trying to make was after you&rsquo;ve put in all the combining diacritics, spacing modifiers, etc. etc., some author will come up with something else &ndash; frequently not in Unicode. But yes, the approach would work for a lot of material. I suppose it is an oddity, but I prefer to make up a glyph to cover the need. We occasionally slip into the private use area, though I try like the dickens to avoid it.</p>
<p>But to respond to the original question, I&rsquo;d say that anything covered  up to &amp; including Latin Extended A doesn&rsquo;t need to be in a ccmp feature.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Maybe, but let&rsquo;s back up a bit. What do you think the purpose of ccmp is? Not just the write-up in the OT features registry tags, but how people will use it.</p>
<p>Aside on Yoruba (included in Pan Nigerian, right?) &ndash; Way back in the late 80s I was involved with a book where there was some discussion about the mark. It appeared that one group wanted a dot, the other a vertical bar. The compromise at the time was a vertical bar, but with the ends rounded&ndash; sort of like a real elongated dot. Another book came along more recently (2003 or so), &amp; we asked the author, through the publisher, what she wanted. At first, it was that &ldquo;rounded-corners bar,&rdquo; but shorter that the 1980s mark. In proof she changed her mind; don&rsquo;t remember which way she went. The point is, you run into this sort of thing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, you really don&rsquo;t want to use the kern feature for positioning marks. Consider, if you kern a zero-width combining mark to the left to position it over a letter, the following letter will follow the mark and collide with the first letter. This is why the OTL mark feature exists: to position marks independently of kerning.</p>
<p>Regarding the contents of the ccmp feature:</p>
<p>This should definitely include any GSUB lookups resulting in precomposed diacritic glyphs that are not directly encoded in Unicode. So, for instance</p>
<p>n candrabindu -&gt; ncandrabindu</p>
<p>would be included because there is no Unicode codepoint for the target diacritic combination. Unless the diacritic is going to be formed on-the-fly using mark positioning, then it must be mapped in the ccmp feature.</p>
<p>What about diacritic combinations that do have precomposed Unicode encodings? We&rsquo;re in a transition period in support of these. Microsoft&rsquo;s Uniscribe and Adobe&rsquo;s CS3 apps perform buffered character-level substitutions for such diacritics, presuming that they are encoded in the font cmap. So, for instance, is a text string contains</p>
<p>a acutecomb</p>
<p>the shaping engine will check to see if the font cmap contains an appropriate entry for the /aacute/ glyph and, if so, use that.</p>
<p>So in theory one doesn&rsquo;t need to include composition lookups for such diacritics in the ccmp feature. However, there is a risk that your font might encounter a shaping engine that does not automatically perform such character level substitutions, in which case it may be helpful to have them in the ccmp feature.</p>

substitutes a base glyph and diacritic(s) by a precomposed diacritic glyph.
[Or decomposes a precomposed diacritic glyph into base glyph and diacritic(s).]</p>
<p>&ldquo;mark&rdquo;
provides positioning information for applications that can compose base glyphs and diacritic(s) &lsquo;on the fly&rsquo;. It defines attachment points (coordinates) first for the accent glyph, and then for the base glyph. This is like placing anchors in FLS, where, upon generating the composite glyph, the diacritic&rsquo;s component is positioned such that its anchor point matches the base glyph&rsquo;s anchor point. The &ldquo;mark&rdquo; feature however is different in that it does not lead to any actual precomposed diacritic glyph in the font &ndash; this part of the job is done by the application. &ldquo;mark&rdquo; only says how it must be done.

<p>What would be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> interesting from a font development point of view is using nothing else than &lsquo;on the fly&rsquo; composition of diacritic glyphs, i.e. no &lsquo;adieresis&rsquo; in the font any more but only one or two lines in the &ldquo;mark&rdquo; feature.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Paul, maybe this will offer a glimpse. If your model is direct-entry typesetting, there is no absolute need for ccmp, because you can always put the character in via the glyph pallet. But let&rsquo;s suppose you have an author preparing a manuscript in MS Word, or any other text editor that &ldquo;honors&rdquo; Unicode. S/he needs a &ldquo;e&rdquo; with a macron above and an ogonek below. Now the typesetter gets the author&rsquo;s files and converts them to his/her typesetting program &ndash; in other words, we have moved from direct-entry typesetting to typesetting from supplied files.</p>
<p>The author <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --> use a code for these characters, and the typesetter search &amp; replace these codes with the correct character, But as long as you stay in Word before finally converting the files, a single replacement character would have to have a private use Unicode index, or you couldn&rsquo;t later search for it (in Word, or any such text editor). If you search &amp; replace with the correct Unicode string, the file can be searched without resorting to private use characters.</p>
<p>Or, the author could just type the Unicode string of &ldquo;e&rdquo; + &ldquo;macron&rdquo; + ogonek, which is unambiguous. Now, if the typesetter has made up the glyph(s) and defined the string in the ccmp feature, that string in the manuscript will call the correct glyph in the typeset file. Moreover, if the glyph is properly named (it has no Unicode number), it can be properly decomposed from a PDF file, in the unlikely event this is needed.</p>
<p>Finally, the character can be kerned, just like any other character. I don&rsquo;t know of any limit to the number of characters that can be strung together with ccmp &ndash; though Adobe&rsquo;s Type 1 (PDF format) will only work for a string of 12  numbers &ndash; i.e., decompose 3 Unicode characters.  I don&rsquo;t know if &ldquo;mark&rdquo; will allow for multiple diacritics. Even if it will, what if the different marks need different positions (anchors)? What about kerning, will it be blocked? Available for different kerning treatment following another letter &ndash; f + e versus f + e + (a marked) grave for example?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d look at all of this, and the various text processors before making a decision.</p>

<p>That is what I said, although perhaps not clearly enough. <em>Unless</em> one is going to use the mark feature to build on-the-fly diacritics, you want diacritic combinations mapped in the ccmp feature. In other words, you have a choice about how to handle arbitrary diacritic sequences:</p>
<p>You can either build them on-the-fly using the mark feature</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>You can include precomposed glyphs and substitute them using the ccmp feature.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">more &lsquo;ccmp&rsquo; questions:
regarding the decomposition portion of this feature, is this handled by the application based on glyph names, or are one to many substitutions involved, or does this work yet another way?
also, what are the gylph composition conventions regarding sequencing? I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s typically glyph+mark, but how bout for glyphs that have two marks above, or one above and one beneath?
and one last question for now, do i+diacritical marks above compose from/decompose to i or dotless i?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Paul: that&rsquo;s not an answer to your question.</p>
<p>More accurately, just as with composition, there are two ways that decomposition can happen.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Based on the Unicode values of the characters involved, not requiring OpenType layout. No relationship here to glyph names, except that Mac OS X still uses glyph names to determine Unicode values (at least for OpenType CFF fonts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on ccmp and one-to-many substitutions. In the font this is based on glyph IDs, but FontLab and AFDKO use glyph names for the source code to create the lookup(s).</p>
</li>
</ol>
