body: "The fonts that I've worked on thus far have all been display type and usually
  based on some form of handlettering.  I understand that these are generally for
  print and usually don't require hinting. I personally don't know the first thing
  about hinting at this point anyway. \r\n\r\nWhat concerns me is how connecting scripts
  that connect on both ends such as \"a\" followed by \"r\" as illustrated start to
  look unconnected at smaller sizes on screen. *note: the middle screen capture has
  been slightly enlarged and the bottom greatly enlarged for viewing. \r\n\r\nThey
  print fine, but on screen look clumsy at smaller sizes. Should I be concerned about
  this?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hinting_5587.jpg]"

    rendering problems. But in reality, the effort-to-reward ratio is pretty unfavorable,
    especially if you are just learning about hinting.

    being so thin it would probably be a difficult task even if I had experience with
    hinting.\r\n\r\n"
