body: Edit-Find or Command-F can help me find glyphs in the font window, but what's
  the easiest way to track a given glyph down in (a) my classes, and (b) my OpenType
  code, within Fontlab?

  body: I'd like to know this too. I recently had to just wipe all my classes and
    rebuild them because I could't find a problem glyph somewhere.

    to laugh at this) is mark the glyph in question in a really special color, which
    makes it easy/easier to spot in the Classes window.\r\n\r\nSomething like a Global
    Glyph Search function would be awesome."

  body: "You can see what classes a given glyph is in by selecting the glyph in the
    Font window and then click the \"Classes...\" button on the \"Glyph Properties\"
    panel. A window pops up containing a list of all classes on the left and a list
    of the classes in which the glyph is used on the right. There are buttons that
    allow you to add or delete the glyph to or from any class.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/classes1_5420.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/classes2_6540.png]"

  body: For tracking down glyphs in OT code, the only way I know of is to copy or
    export the feature(s) to a text file and search using a text editor.
