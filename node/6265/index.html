<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Firstly, can I just say what a great resource this truly is.

<div class=commentbody>Darren, <br> <br>I'm not much of a type designer myself, so I can't <br>go into depth about what to improve. I do look <br>at a lot of type, and this looks like the work <br>of Hubert Jocham.

<div class=commentbody> Darren congratilations and welcome with this very interesting sans serif which I think that have very potential !!. I like very much this kind of forms. I would so want to make some suggestions: <br> <br>1 > The the capitals and figures have more impact than lowercase letters. <br>2 > The c/l and l/c ( Ss ) the spine are too contrast that the others letters, like the caracthers ( MNQZz ). <br>3 > The letter l/c ( a ) is little too condensed that the others I think. <br> <br>But I think you are going in the right way, the work have very good apperence! <br>Do you have more letters to show? <br>Regards and good work to finnish the work. <br> <br>Ricardo </div>

<div class=commentbody> Darren, <br> <br>Welcome to the forum, and thanks for participating! At risk of repeating Ricardo's critique, it appears that the face (at least at this magnification) has varying stroke weights within the letters. This creates dark spots in letters like the S. I will make this request, howver- can you set some words and/or phrases in the face? Sometimes it helps to see the overall color and rhythm of the face to effectively critique it. And oftimes, variation and nuance within the face itself can really bring the type to life. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Darren, <br> <br>This has the potential to be a great and highly versatile typeface. Ironically, it reminded me of Erik Spiekermann's faces (Officina, Meta), but I too can see the similarities with Hubert Jocham's faces now that the resemblances have been pointed out. <br> <br>I would echo all of the suggestions so far, and add a couple of my own: <br> <br>1. As Ricardo mentioned about the lc "a" being a bit condensed, you may want to look at all of the letters' widths in relation to one another. The proportions seem slightly off (lc "v", "w" and uc "V" seem a bit wide, while lc "a", "k", "m", "n", "u", "y", uc "J", "K", "M", "P", "R" and "W" seem narrow). <br> <br>2. You may want to try bringing the vertex of the lc "y" down closer to or slightly below the baseline. This may help balance the body with the tail, and also may help balance its width with the other characters. OR, as an alternative to this, try widening the angles of the two strokes just a bit. Or maybe a little of both. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>3. I agree that the lower case set seems lighter than the upper case and figures sets. I like the look of the weight of the upper case and figures, so I would suggest making the lower case slightly heavier. <br> <br>I really like the design of the lc "a". And I find the differing terminal cuts on the uc "K" and lc "k" to be really interesting. It would be interesting to see you apply the same terminals to some other characters, such as uc "R", uc "X" and lc "x". <br> <br>I'm looking forward to seeing this face evolve. <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Very nice. <br> <br>I wonder if the relative widths that David points <br>out are cues taken from monospaced fonts <br>like Orator. I see that resemblance in some of <br>the caps, especially M. Is this intentional? <br> <br>Can I suggest posting a sample setting.

<div class=commentbody>Wow! I didn't expect such a response and great advice so soon - this is fantastic, and worth so much - thankyou. It's gonna take me a bit to digest all of your comments and advice, but I fully intend on developing the typeface further. I'll post regular 'updates,' to let you all see the way the face is developing. I've got some free time coming up at the end of the week, but that 'free' time has now been filled with working on the typeface! <br> <br>Thanks once again for all the posts. Learning about type design this way is absoloutly brilliant, and sharing your knowledge is very kind. I'll post up a revision and some set text soon. <br> <br>Cheers <br> <br>Darren <br> <br><blockquote><hr size=0><b>Quote:</b><p>"There is a good sense in which any designer worth the name will be a student for the whole of his working life." <br><i> Norman Potter, What is a Designer</i><hr size=0></blockquote></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi, <br> <br>I've done a quick text setting using the face. I haven't done any modifications to the face since the first post. Basically, I've imported the face into FontLab (the first image is taken from illustrator where I drew the letters initially), created a font file and then set the text. I haven't done any work on character spacing/kerning etc etc, it's just a very raw and basic setting. Hope this helps. <br> <br>Cheers <br> <br>Darren <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/482.gif alt=Iris_02.gif></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello all, <br> <br>Thanks for all of your input - I've been working on the typeface recently (though trying to get some spare time to do so has proved pretty difficult!), making some amendments and changes which you all suggested. I feel that the changes have really helped the face start to look a little more 'professional(!)' So I thought I would post up a new image. I haven't worked on any of the character spacing or hinting (yikes - that bit scares me) so far - and I'm also working on all of the remaining characters, which, hopefully, I'll be able to post up soon. <br> <br>Any comments or recommendations/thoughts about the amended face will be greatly appreciated. <br> <br>Cheers <br> <br>Darren <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/559.gif alt=iris_1.1.gif></div>

<div class=commentbody> It forms a nice, serene pattern. Just the lc "g" is maybe sticking out a bit: its structure is calm enough, so I'd say your descenders might be too long. As for the spacing, it's really way tight. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> It's coming along nicely! <br> <br>I agree that the letterspacing might be a bit too tight. Loosening it up a bit would help, especially considering the machine-like nature of the font. <br> <br>I think the word spacing might be a bit too wide as well. Consider making the word space character about 75% (or perhaps even 50%) of its current width, and see how that works. <br> <br>Good luck!

<div class=commentbody>Here's the font so far, including the numerals. They still need a little tweaking granted. There are also a few other problems that I need to resolve - the U/C Q is a little heavy, as are a few other characters and maybe the proportions of the U/C N needs looking at. Some of the characters with accents need tweaking also. Anyway, that aside, any other comments</div>

<div class=commentbody> I think your lc is looking great, except: <br>1. The "k"'s upper arm is/seems too long. <br>2. The "m"'s counters seem unequal. <br>3. The "w" is too wide. I know it's tempting to make it two "v"s (I've done that myself), but it's better to make the strokes less inclined; you might also consider stopping the middle part before it reaches the x-height - it helps readability. <br> <br>For your UC, I like most of the forms individually, but I think you have an important -and equally challenging- decision to make: do you want all the caps to approximately converge in width (the "contemporary" approach), or do you want them to diverge (like in "old style" fonts)? The latter I myself prefer, even in designs like this, not least because it makes all-caps setting much less unreadable. Right now it seems your caps are somewhere in between the two approaches, and I think that's a problem. Also: there's still some color imbalance, although a GIF is a terrible place to judge that - you really have to go lino before you can be confident of the color (especially as mass text). <br> <br>Numerals: very nice, except for the joins of the "6" and "9" being tucked in too much - note how nice and open your "8" is. Your "7" is killer. I might make the zero rounder. <br> <br>Accents: they seem unfinished, at least in terms of placement. I'd just say that your ring might be a little too light, and you could raise the umlauts a bit, esp in the lc. <br> <br>I'd make the "ae" one glyph: flatten the top of the "a"'s bowl to unite the strokes; get rid of the "a"'s stem at the baseline. The slashes on your "O"/"o"/cent are too steep. The Yen's top bar is clotting. The dollar looks unbalanced - but to be honest I actually like to encourage ugly dollarsigns. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Thanks Hrant <br> <br>I totally see your comments - I actually looked at the lc 'k' and 'm' today and thought the same. I didn't see the w being too wide though, but I shall revisit it and make amendments - the point about the middle part being lowered I understand and will investigate. <br> <br>The UC does have a problem with its proportions which I think comes from me being a total (but hungry) novice. The colour imbalance is again a problem which I feel stems from both my 'beginner' approach and my relative inexperience with the software - they looked fine on paper! I do need to make a decision as to their proportions. <br> <br>The numerals are a first draft and the '6' and '9' do need opening up I agree. Thanks for the positive comments - I was a little nervous as the previous lining numerals were awful, and I wasn't totally sure about these ones - although I felt they were a lot better than their predecessors. This is pretty much the first time they have all been put together with the other characters. <br> <br>The accents again are 'work in progress' and do need some tweaking. The 'ring' does need some weight adding to it. <br> <br>The 'ae' glyph has gone a little crazy - I just looked at the paper based drawing and on that I had removed the a's stem - quality control a little lax there! The comments about the other characters I will take on board when I make some amendments. <br> <br>Thanks very much for your input - your comments are greatly valued. <br> <br>I'll post a revision up as soon as it's ready. <br> <br>Cheers <br> <br>Darren </div>

<div class=commentbody>Darren: <br> <br>I hope you're going to include BOTH lining and old-style numerals, as they each have their place. Old-style numerals, in general, are best for text settings, of course, but lining numerals are generally preferred for headlines and tabular columns. With a versatile font like this one, the inclusion of both types of numerals would be most appropriate. <br> <br>Hrant mentioned most of the suggestions that I noticed (and a few that I thought were fine as they are, but I'll be interested to see how you incorporate them anyway... <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> ). <br> <br>As far as your upper-case proportions, take a look at: <br> <br>Adobe Trajan (<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4465.html target=_top>http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4465.html</a>), <br> <br>Adobe Charlemagne (<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily1163.html target=_top>http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily1163.html</a>) or <br> <br>Adobe Penumbra (<a href=http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_907.html target=_top>http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_907.html</a>) <br> <br>for comparison. These are some excellent examples of "old-style" upper case proportions. <br> <br>Great work so far! <br> <br>David</div>

<div class=commentbody>David, nice refs. <br> <br>I would also add the caps of Octavian, since they do borrow the good from the classical widths, but are not afraid to improve things (like the "S"). Caps are essentially lapidary (not calligraphic), and Will Carter and David Kindersley were stone/wood cutters, which explains why their caps are the most graceful and effective, I find. <br><a href=http://www.myfonts.com/FontStyle11493.html target=_top>http://www.myfonts.com/FontStyle11493.html</a> <br> <br>Meridien is also interesting in this regard: <br><a href=http://www.myfonts.com/CharacterMap10477.html target=_top>http://www.myfonts.com/CharacterMap10477.html</a> <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>? <br>Unless I'm going blind, the only thing in there pertaining to widths is: "All glyphs in proportionally spaced typefaces have advance widths that are dependent on their proportional design." <br> <br>---- <br> <br>I think the decision of which way to go for a given design (converge the widths or diverge them) is a very interesting question, especially when it comes to caps (in a text face at least lc forms need to be so functional as to strongly favor divergent widths). I personally like divergent UC widths even in designs that many people would probably advise to go convergent (like maybe this one). I'm not really sure why, and I don't really have a feel of where to draw the line. <br> <br>It might help to look at good examples: what are some fonts where the choice was obviously good (Charlemagne?), versus designs that some of us might find difficult to agree with, like the [otherwise?] wonderful Richler: <br> <br><a href=http://www.shinntype.com/Assets/Richler_Specimen.pdf target=_top>http://www.shinntype.com/Assets/Richler_Specimen.pdf</a> <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody> Incidentally, Darren, my comments are not directed toward you per se, but novice designers in general. <br> <br>Also note that sans is rather uneventful for text settings and becomes cumbersome rather quickly. <br> <br>WWMCD? Alas, remember the sheer brilliance of Carter and snap-on serifs? You have a nice base. Snap some serifs on Iris and then set some text. Compare the readability.

<div class=commentbody> I'm always tempted to remind that any real text face has serifs, but I stop myself, thinking: "there's more to life than readability" - as long as the designer knows what functionality he's sacrificing for some "stylistic" gain. It's hard to know if Darren intends this to be a text face (and frankly that almost doesn't matter: the hardest part of making a text face is "simply" convincing others that it's a text face!), although some things (like the OS nums) seem to indicate that. It could still be as adequate for text as all those other nice sans designs we see from good designers - but sure, a serif version would be doubly sweet. <br> <br>BTW, but WTF (PTL) is "WWMCD"? <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hopefully the ""stylistic"" gain of great blocks of sans is diminishing in the eyes of many. <br> <br>Your language is rather coarse Hrant, but I will PYL if you must speak acronymically. My acronym should have been apparent to you of all people. WWMCD. What Would Matthew Carter Do e.g. What Would Jesus Do, WWJD. <br> <br>As far as I know, Jesus wasn't a typophile so he doesn't get talked about a lot on this site, but he is the GIANT. You don't need a Search Engine to find Him because he is already with us. <br> <br>Moving on. See ""Walker"", a Makela-commissioned face, that featured snap on serifs. <br> <br>Please Hrant, do not respond further regarding my comments, but to this typeface specifically. <br> <br>I do not want to get involved too deeply into this site. I will check back from time to time but alas, I am off to the airport. <br> <br>Please, all young type designers get in touch with the basics, be good to others, and as Hrant has said, study the work of the Masters, such as Matthew Carter and soon-to-be Masters such as Tobias and Jonathan. May I also put in a word for the Master himself. Bless you. </div>

<div class=commentbody> I agree with Joe here. <br> <br>In general I agree with the common notion that good text faces tend to be serified, but I also point out that there are several excellent exceptions to this rule. Franklin Gothic, Helvetica, Univers, Bureau Gothic, Officina, Meta, Gill Sans, Radiant, Syntax, and Scala Sans (among many others) are all examples of serifless faces that work well for setting some text applications. <br> <br>No font, serifed or serifless, works equally well for setting all text applications. <br> <br>If we have learned anything typographically in the 20th century, it is that to talented designers, the long-held rules of typography must be both followed and broken. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>Remember also that Carter's "snap-on serifs" were an experiment in themselves; classic serifs were designed into the font from day one, never designed as an afterthought to be snapped on after the fact. <br> <br>In my view, Iris stands alone as a well-designed (and evolving) sans-serif face, and that direction should be seen through to the end. A serifed version can come later. <br> <br>Watching this one grow with much interest, <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Yeah, Walker was comissioned by Laurie Makela when she was running the design operation at Walker in the early '90s I think. There has been a lot written about the Walker type. One good article can be found in Eye no. 19 (1995). It's all about how the font was comissioned and designed.

Even during my studies in Holland. The good thing about the font is not only its quality, but it reflexes your love, interest and willingness to design type!! Which is often difficult to find. <br> <br>I am curious about your serifed version. Because in your font the ending are very typical and therefore pretty important for its character. And that is where later on the serifs will be! <br> <br>About the textface issue. Guys, we live in 21st Century! Last century some designers proved us, sansserifs can be used and designed very well as textfaces! </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hrant, <br>I could reply by saying that the mass only has been reading for maybe 150 years, but I won't. Your point is clear and you're right. <br> <br>The point I wanted to make, is maybe reading will have to be redescribed/redefined. Most of the people in 2 generations will probably know reading solely from monitors. If those won't become HiRes, Sansserif faces will be used a lot more for text then it is the case a the moment. <br> <br>Jacques <br> <br>PS: Readability in the future would make a nice discussion topic </div>

<div class=commentbody> Andy, thanks for reference. Barnes and Noble doesn't have it, but Borders does. I'll check it out. <br> <br>Now that I think about it, Letterhead Fonts and others (Font Diner's Milwaukee, I think it's called) have a similar concept, that is fonts that you build by layering two fonts together. Walker seems like its the first to do this with self-contained serifs. <br> <br>This is something I'm going to experiment with surely because I want to find out 'how' to do it and because the font is 'private', that makes it more interesting. It may be uncommercial but all work and no play makes jack a dull boy, eh? <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> (That's just a reference to an American movie, The Shining w/ Jack Nicholson, no hidden meanings or anything.) <br> <br>re, the serifs: A readability question. Why do serifs help us recognize words better? Growing up, kids see a lot of san-serifs, especially when they are learning 'lettering' in first grade. Does anyone have a short answer? </div>

<div class=commentbody> > Readability in the future would make a nice discussion topic <br> <br>Totally. I think -like you implied- it depends a lot on display technology. LCDs are becoming standard, which means ClearType-style technology will be a big factor, but also I think there's room for more hand-crafting of bitmaps, very much so in grayscale. <br> <br>> no hidden meanings or anything <br> <br>Yeah, right (you obsessive, ax-wielding font freak). <br> <br>> Why do serifs help us recognize words better? <br> <br>It's hard to keep it short (especially when one has to first dismiss a bunch of traditional but laughable theories - like the one that says they help guide the eye like train tracks... gimme a break, linespacing already does that 100 times better, thank you very much), but I see it as two-pronged: <br> <br>1. Serifs help distinguish one glyph from another (to varying extents). <br> <br>2. Serifs help glyphs coalesce into boumas (word shapes), instead of standing out individually. Kind of like why tight spacing helps readability, noting that if you space a sans too tightly the counters overpower the inter-letter spacing (ruining the distribution of color in a bouma), while in a serif face the serifs start touching (facilitating the coalesce thing) before that happens/needs_to_happen. <br> <br>This is in addition to the familiarity factor (which some people however over-rate). <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody>Dear Darren, <br> <br>I'm new to this site, and it's great to see typedesigns evolve from rough sketch towards a 'good' design. <br> <br>BUT <br> <br>I find this difficult to say... <br>Look at: <br>http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/ArgoRegular.html <br> <br>there you will find the Argo typeface, designed by Gerard Unger. Evolved from his typeface 'Swift' as a sans-serif. <br> <br>Look and compare. Your design looks like a copy of this typeface. Hereby two plates of the Dutchtypelibrary-site. <br> <br>It's just my view, but be aware, <br> <br>succes <br> <br>matthijs <br> <br> </div>
