  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've been commissioned for a Shakespeare in the Park logo and poster. For background, it's a very well-attended event (last year, I believe, the production drew over 50,000 people).
For the logo, I wanted to give it a primarily typographic treatment. Initial thoughts went to faces like Temporal, or even Archive Penman Script, but I was wondering if any of the great minds here might have a better, or even surprising, suggestion before I get started.

Why not go for a modern look?
All these fonts are just fakes of historical originals.
Or is the play about fake? Don’t remember it that well.
My 2 cents.

		<div class="commentbody">Chuck, what a great commission! The kind of thing I'd give my eye teeth for. Sadly, my local Shakespeare in the Park company is now defunct, so I no longer get the chance to picnic in front of the thespians, or pitch for their design work. 

Eric's suggestion is very funny, but perhaps will go straight over the heads of the park-strolling masses. 

My 2¢ on the design; concerning the logo, one question might be '...is the poster for the play the only context the logo will be seen in?' If the logo has to work as a standalone device, then the period letterforms approach may be superfluous, because the company's key point of difference appears to be the locale of their performances.</div>

Yes, it will be a labor of love (and, I'm hoping, a good view of the production).
The logo will be used on posters and additional promotional materials, as well as the website, etc.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Having recently read <em>Much Ado</em>, I thought I'd chime in. The play centers on two couples, Benedick and Beatrice and Claudio and Hero. Benedick and Beatrice spar verbally throughout the play for a great deal of comedy, and as a result of their friends' trickery, they acknowledge their love for each other by the end. While Claudio and Hero also marry at the end, there is a sinister element to the plot, as Don John (sort of like a prototype for Iago in <em>Othello</em>) schemes to drive them apart. He manages to convince Claudio that Hero has been unfaithful, causing him to leave her at the altar. Until Don John is found out, the play skirts death and duelling.

The most disturbing element to the play (if it is emphasized) is the idea that you cannot believe your senses: the constant deceptions make what the characters hear and see falsely ("I have deceived even your very eyes").

So, to try to connect this to typography, maybe what would speak to the specific character of the play would be a typeface that is pleasant and fun but that has, if not an insidious touch, a bit of imperfection or mystery. <a href=http://typography.net/type/enigma.htm>Enigma</a> and <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000073#specimen>Delicato</a> both have some aspects that draw the eye's attention (just enough), and <a href=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Proforma>Proforma</a> in light weights seems to almost shake as if hiding something behind it. Finally, <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pampatype/quimera/>Quimera</a>, because of its odd weight distribution, looks odd , but you can't quite tell what's weird about it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chuck, Patty's comment notwithstanding, I like what you've done in terms of the type arrangement/contrast of forms at the top (if it was me, I'd letterspace the capitals a bit and close up the spacing on the italic U&lc title, but I suspect this falls into some kind of eggs-sucking category of advice...)

The blueness in the stage photo is standout – but below the photo of the scenery, how much of that stuff really needs to be there? The daylight slice of the Shakespeare Festivals segment is really quite jarring against the artificial nightscape above it. As is the red background behind the logos.

Is there any chance you can convince those nice people that the stage photo should be extended to full bleed along the bottom edge and that all the logos should be reversed out and floated in front of the picture?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I appreciate everyone's input. Ben- thanks for the thoughts about the title type. Letterspacing the UC was an idea I had, but decided against (maybe not a good decision) since it was so small in scale under the script - and red to boot - that I chose to take a more straight-forward approach.
As I said, though, the poster (in this incarnation, anyway) will not see the light of day; I'm working on other aspects of the pr.  But I did want to get some feedback, which has been very valuable to me. Interestingly, I have designed a number of posters in the last several years, but almost every one has been a foreign-language project. Designing in a language you don't speak well has strange challenges, but it does allow you to look at your type as the "shapes" as we were taught, even without all the "turn it upside down and squint" stuff. But working in English again (and you can't get much more English than Shakespeare!) has been fun.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps try aligning the top of the xheight of "through" with the larger xheight of "Sunday"? "Through" may also be better a bit smaller. There isn't quite enough contrast now.

		<div class="commentbody">very good point, Chris. Another idea I toyed with was dropping a 20% gray over the "through," to quiet it a bit, while what I really wanted was ital (though it's Impact, and I don't think there IS an italic...)</div>

Thanks very much for your input and viewpoints. As I posted earlier, I do a lot of foreign language work, and this piece in English offered some interesting challenges that reached beyond what I even expected. Your thoughts, opinions and steerage was appreciated and well-received.

		<div class="commentbody">I should probably let this thread die, but as part of my research on Shakespeare's handwriting I came upon this thread once again (through James' reference above to humanist handwriting being more appropriate for the poster than blackletter). Although my study so far is very preliminary, I have learned that Shakespeare as far as I know wrote in a "secretary hand" (digital examples <a href=http://www.crazydiamond.co.uk/fonts/sec.html>here</a> and <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=SWT0000014>here</a>), which is related to the Bastarda blackletter. While at the time people were using the italic style that would soon predominate (as seen in the Queen Elizabeth sample), it was not what Will used -- although he did often employ an italic long s in his signature. James was perfectly correct in suggesting that the humanist handwriting might be appropriate for the <em>Much Ado</em> poster (it's certainly easier to read than secretary hand!), but I just wanted to correct this for posterity's sake. </div>
