  several embroidery sites, but it's just called curly script or classic monogram,
  etc.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any help or pointers.\r\n\r\nBobbi Jo[img:sites/default/files/old-images/curly

  body: "Hello Mike,\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your response.  Yes, I love Harold's
    monogram fonts.  Just purchased his original monogram set a few weeks ago and
    it works great for embroidery lettering.  :)\r\n\r\nI don't have his vine font,
    but it's tempting.  :)\r\n\r\nI'll keep searching for this one and hopefully if
    it doesn't exist in ttf format yet maybe someone will do it eventually.  Wish
    I knew how...\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nBobbi Jo"
