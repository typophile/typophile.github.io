  body: Interesting. At first this whole stencil thing was not really interesting
    to me. But, it is now growing on me and I&#39;m starting to appreciate the differences.
    Does your typeface have grungy and not grungy variants?

  body: I agree that this font needs a &#39;clean&#39; variant. It has some interesting
    letters that would be cool in a non-grunge context &#40;the A in particular&#41;.
    Besides, grunge characters always look better distressed by the designer, as opposed
    to the type designer. It avoids goofy looking side by side &#39;random&#39; letters
    that are exactly the same.

    I create and just not to dirty the letter.   <BR>Thank you for the it criticizes
