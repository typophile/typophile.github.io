  hours, and the name of the foundry who made it, but it's quite difficult to find
  it. Any saver could help me?\r\n\r\nI've been told it's very popular, but i've been
  browsing on a lot of foundries and shops and didn't find it anywhere.\r\n\r\nsorry
  for the quality of the image, i know it's quite pixelised, but this is more or less
  the only example i have.\r\n\r\nthank you in advance for your help!"
