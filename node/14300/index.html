Testing and research always implies in limiting a problem to certain conditions; you can proof that something works better than another thing, but only under certain conditions. The good thing about scientific studies, though, is that we can use them as reference, being most useful when discussing a project with a colleague or a client.</div>

<p>On his site, Montalbano now has up &lt;href=&ldquo;<a href="http://terminaldesign.com/custom_road_rawlinson.shtml%22%3ERawlinson">http://terminaldesign.com/custom_road_rawlinson.shtml&quot;&gt;Rawlinson</a> Roadway</a>, a serif font for road signs approved for federal roads (national parks?). He says that it has also been tested, with similar successful results to Clearview.</p>
<p>So I think the &lsquo;san-serif&rsquo; part of Eduardo&rsquo;s specification needs to be modified.</p>
<p>I also noticed that London&rsquo;s Heathrow Airport now has a serif face for way finding. &ndash;Is it a variation of Charter? Does anyone know about this? I don&rsquo;t like it that much (I like Rawlinson Road better), but it works well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just guessing here, but it might have something to do with what&rsquo;s available in ready-made die-cut vinyl letters. A great deal of the signage in the DC Metro system is done with peel-and-stick.</p>
<p>BTW, DC has Clarendon signage out the wazoo&hellip;very popular in the 50s, when a lot of Fderal buildings and signage got their last major facelift.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m with Terry, asking why there are such conventions around which kinds of typefaces are deemed legible for signage. To me, axioms like &ldquo;Sans serif is best for signs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Serif type is more readable than Sans&rdquo; are just parroted assumptions, not empirically true. Clearview is an enormous improvement over the original, engineered faces, but I have an idea that there is more yet to be discovered about which typefaces are most clear, useful, quickly read, etc. in wayfinding situations. In fact, my theory depends on ignoring, destroying or transcending the perceived opposition between serif and sans. I will prepare some test characters soon and post them.</div>

<p>Often, yes, but not always. Like when I say it, it&rsquo;s because of a combination of empirical and anecdotal evidence. I say it because it makes sense.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David Kindersley was convinced that upper case serif was easier to read on a sign than upper and lower case sans serif. Have a look at this article by Kindersley:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbrd.co.uk/histories/wartoworboys/4.shtml">http://www.cbrd.co.uk/histories/wartoworboys/4.shtml</a></p>
<p>The impression I get from Kindersley is that Transport, the sans serif u&amp;lc font, was chosen because it was trendy at the time to use &ldquo;Swiss-looking&rdquo; sans serifs (hence Transport is an iteration of Akzidenz Gtotesk with occasional alterations to aid legibility) and not because of any inherent legibility qualities in the font itself. However, if you&rsquo;d just had your font rejected by people who didn&rsquo;t really understand your craft and someone else&rsquo;s work was going to appear on the signs across the nation, you might want to push your point a bit. I guess as an apprentice to Eric Gill, and a lover of stone cutting, he probably thought that a &lsquo;grotesque&rsquo; solution was just that.</p>
<p>For reference, the Transport fonts (Kinneir/Calvert) used in the United Kingdom can be found here:
<a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_control/documents/contentservertemplate/dft_index.hcst?n=9430&amp;l=3">http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_control/documents/contentservertemplate/dft_index.hcst?n=9430&amp;l=3</a></p>
<p>As far as legibility testing itself is concerned, it can ultimately only solve the problem of finding which of two <em>existing</em> fonts is more legible. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily point you in the right direction for the optimum. So font <em>A</em> may be more legible than font <em>B</em>, but font <em>C</em> (yet to be designed) may <em>look</em> completely different from <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> but perform much better under controlled testing conditions. Unfortunately testing didn&rsquo;t really help your endeavour to devise font <em>C</em>. I assume you want to design the optimum font rather than simply establish which is the best existing font. Testing may not help.</p>

<p>(However, train station names could be done in really long signs with hyperextended fonts, so you can read them when you&rsquo;re whizzing through at high speed. I&rsquo;ve never seen this, but surely somewhere in the world has done it?)</p>
<p>Otherwise, I believe it&rsquo;s more important to get some brand differentiation going with your signage. Like, this is a unique place, not just another mall/town full of franchises. And for wayfinding, unless it&rsquo;s on a university campus, signage is going to be competing for eyespace with commercial signage, so why not use a different kind of type to what appears there? This is the same principle that periodical art directors often use, so that their editorial pages don&rsquo;t look like ads.</p>
<p>One of the pleasures of relocating to Norwich has been the street signs here, which are cast iron, in a Victorian sans serif.</p>

<p>Note that vision behaves very differently depending on whether the subject is moving or not: when looking at a mass of stationary objects, we saccade; but when looking at something that&rsquo;s moving, the eyes &ldquo;track&rdquo; it smoothly. Yes, Science, sorry. However, how this affects reading I don&rsquo;t know for sure. But I have a hunch we&rsquo;re not attuned to reading moving things well; I suspect we switch between saccading and tracking, not getting good info to &ldquo;process&rdquo;.</p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m talking about lateral movement here: driving directly towards a highway sign is saccade-based, although I suspect as parallax increases reading starts breaking down. In fact James has equated highway fonts with text fonts; personally, although I see some similarities, the difference I think is that true immersive reading uses the parafovea. And I personally prefer to use my parafovea for spotting cops using on-ramps.  :-)</p>

<p>What research can you point us toward re: reading/legibility in these wayfinding situations? Nick brings up something interesting: On a highway, movement is much more a factor. Other factors come into play in a train station, or inside a train.</p>
<p>I heard from a friend who visited Japan that they&rsquo;ve used those silly blinking LED sticks to good effect in the subway: When the train goes by, the images they generate are stretched out and revealed, not by the viewer&rsquo;s waggling head, but by the speed of the train. So riders get pictures flashed at them. Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t think the pictures are very compelling, but it&rsquo;s interesting to think about how to make a signal/sign/image appear clearly to someone in a moving vehicle.</p>

<p>Carl, I haven&rsquo;t focused on signage research - James should know tons about that though. That said, a lot of the more fundamental research efforts (like measurements of single letter decipherment, at various distances - a common theme) are applicable to virtually any reading task.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick J., I read the links that you posted. I think its interesting that two different avenues can be justified by the same study. Maybe there is no real proof that sans serif is better than serif or vice versa? Another thing to take into account is that people &ldquo;scan&rdquo; signs, and don&rsquo;t really read them. So what&rsquo;s easiest to &ldquo;scan&rdquo; quickly in an environment would yield different results than &ldquo;reading&rdquo; under table lamp.</div>

<p>Admittedly, on a highway very often a driver is &ldquo;scanning&rdquo; a sign for a street name he knows is there - he just wants to know where to exit.

<p>There&rsquo;s a good amount evidence supporting this, its been documented. (See: Wayfinding: People, Signs and Architecture for one example). The other comes from basic observation. Most of the time when I ask people questions about signs, or information on them, most of the time they say: &ldquo;oh, I didn&rsquo;t see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most people I think just grab the bits of information they need and move on. Signs are short for a reason and don&rsquo;t usually consist of several lines of text. Attention span, and the ability to absorb info quickly is why I feel signs aren&rsquo;t read. The action of &ldquo;reading&rdquo; is quite different in nature.</p>

But when it <strong>is</strong> brought to attention, it is &ldquo;read&rdquo;, not &ldquo;scanned&rdquo;. At least the way I use the terms.</p>
<p>BTW, I feel that in immersive reading as well people &ldquo;grab the bits of information they need&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just that book text has a lot less redundacy, so you have to read -almost- everything. However, this heuristic nature does nicely explain why the parafovea (which is quite lo-res) is so useful in immersive reading, and why boumas exist.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what is happening in the subway or at an airport? Information goes from being narrative to being like objects. Icons and arrows become as functional and informative as type, when the choices are many and there&rsquo;s no time to read each one. In this situation, I think we take broad, snapshot-like impressions and process them one at a time until we get ones we need to move on. I think the parafovea is working much harder then. We&rsquo;re looking for large chunks. Big Boumas!  ;D  Of course this is in a situation where the signage program is thorough.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When you read text, you deal with whole words at a time. You don&rsquo;t break words down to work out each word from its constituent characters (unless it&rsquo;s new to you), you recognise words because of their shape. Ascenders and descenders help this part of the process. First and last characters of words are also important. Finally the rest of the characters in the word are needed if the other two criteria have not proved decisive. So you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;read&rdquo; individual words as such, you only &ldquo;recognise&rdquo; them. &ldquo;Reading&rdquo; then is an overall process of &ldquo;recognising&rdquo; and &ldquo;piecing together&rdquo; multiple words/phrases and then transferring them into sensible thoughts.</p>
<p>On signs, you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;read&rdquo; a destination in the same way as you read a paragraph of text, you merely perform the initial stage of the process, the &ldquo;recognising&rdquo; a word firstly from its shape, secondly from its first and last characters*, thirdly from the rest of the characters. It is an important distinction to make because, on a sign, you are not really concerned with the &ldquo;piecing together&rdquo; part of the reading process and far more concerned with making the individual words (and occasionally phrases) recognisable to the user.</p>
<p>The theory that upper and lower case is more helpful is based on the assumption that words are easier to recognise by their shape than by their constituent characters. There is however an argument that says upper case only is better because individual upper case letters are more distinctive. However, I would suggest that word shape is higher in the batting order than individual character distinctiveness.</p>

<p>Maybe the word is &ldquo;recognise&rdquo;. After all you can only recognise a face in a crowd if you &ldquo;see&rdquo; it. You may or may not have been deliberately looking for it but if you see it, chances are you&rsquo;ll recognise it (if it&rsquo;s a face you &ldquo;know&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The first thing signage has to do then is be recognisable as such. You need to &ldquo;know&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a sign or it&rsquo;s just another face in a crowd. Wayfinding is all about feeling secure. Nothing does that quite like seeing someone or something you know.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, some people -especially these days- have stopped believing the &ldquo;whole word&rdquo; theory of reading; they&rsquo;ve come to put -misguided- faith in what&rsquo;s called the parallel-letterwise model, where words are indeed compiled (although not sequentially) through their constituent letters exclusively.</p>
<p>My own -admittedly ongoing- research has arrived at the conculsion that we read what I&rsquo;ve come to call &ldquo;bouma&quot;s: these are sometimes whole whole words (ones that are very frequent and short), sometimes individual letters (in the fovea), but generally, they are <strong>clusters of letters</strong>. When you look at all the empirical data, take into account anecdotal evidence, and throw in beliefs about human cognition, it&rsquo;s the only thing that makes sense - to me at least.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">One of the very few benefits derived from youthful indiscretions (otherwise known as taking psychoiactive drugs in the 60s) was a realization of the primacy of <strong>pattern recognition</strong> in human cognition. I doubt that anyone who hasn&rsquo;t been there (either through drug use or psychosis) can fully appreciate the flood of sensory impressions that we receive every conscious second; the only way we can really navigate through this riot of sights, sounds, tastesm smells and touches is by employing pattern recognition to select useful, important or just familiar stimuli, and discard the rest.

What Carl was talking about I think is that symbols play a necessary role in wayfinding as well as typography. What I&rsquo;m trying to approach (although I don&rsquo;t know how possible) is to create a wayfinding system that is as universal (multilingual) as possible without typography confusing the issue. Words in context, mean more than words individually. For example since we&rsquo;ve been using this word frequently:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>But there must be a reason people worry about speed of decipherment. Otherwise switching to Clearview for example (or switching at all) is pretty hard to justify. And I think the reason is that in &ldquo;boundary conditions&rdquo;, like bad weather combined with being in an unfamiliar part of town/the_country, recognition time does matter; if you&rsquo;re trying to decide to get into the exit lane or not, switching between reading the signs and minding the (non-confused) local traffic whizz by you, a fraction of a second can make or break it; you might hit somebody passing you on the right, or miss your exit and get frustrated (ie more likely to hit something).</p>
<p>And this is in fact quite similar to &ldquo;regular&rdquo; reading: you&rsquo;re not always in a hurry to finish something you&rsquo;re reading, but sometimes, yes you are. It&rsquo;s just that the chance of dying is somewhat less.  :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Time is the critical element. I was saying speed isn&rsquo;t a factor since the sign is not zipping by. You are closing in on the decision point. The sign is in your field of view. The farther away you can read it the better. Sometimes when people discuss this topic they make it sound like all of these signs are zipping by them and they have to turn their heads to read they as they go flashing by. That is not how it works. Distance from the sign, how far away can you read it, that is all that matters. So legibility distances and recongnition distances are what the research tries to measure. The Clearview stuff is legible and more recognizable from farther away, that is why the switch is on.</div>

<p>Since recognition of words, once you can view them clearly, is virtually instantaneous, the <em>earlier</em> you can do it, the better. In this case, speed of approach does not affect time taken to decipher anywhere near as much as the actual design of the characters on the sign, which is why ClearviewHwy and Transport are so good. You can &ldquo;read&rdquo; (recognise/scan/whatever&hellip;) them from much further away than their predecessors, so you have more time to make your decision.</p>
<p>In theory, the further away a sign is the less your speed affects the reading process (i.e. if you have a very big sign on the horizon, it&rsquo;s going to be a lot easier to read than a little sign nearby that is moving quickly realtive to your car where your mind has to cope with the speed as well as the deciphering.</p>
<p>So, if you have to slow down to read a sign, there are several possibilities. Either:</p>
<ul>
<li>you&rsquo;re not really concentrating</li>
<li>you&rsquo;re breaking the law</li>
<li>the sign was positioned badly</li>
<li>the sign was designed badly (and maybe the typeface used was badly designed)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of UK roadsigns which are very clear and usually very well positioned, you were probably caning it or napping.</p>

<p>For purposes of earlier recognition, Clearview has demonstrated superiority over the awful mechanical signage letters that preceded. Now that there&rsquo;s something better to compare against, I find I hate looking at older highway signs. Those blobby e&rsquo;s, those clotted B&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I do actually feel there is more that can be done to clarify, or sharpen, or aid recognition, of letters and the words they make up, on the level of typeface design. It won&rsquo;t be an earth-shattering improvement; I think Clearview has made a great leap already. Nobody&rsquo;s myopia will clear up suddenly. Still, I am interested in playing with all the possibilities in letter design and type design to maximize word recognition. I&rsquo;ve done some test shapes, and I&rsquo;ll make another variant this weekend, and share it. Terry has been sharing his ideas and findings in his research with me, and has got me intrigued with the possibilities again. The old sketches have come out.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Highway signage is a special case.  Even street name signs have a different function. For me they require more character to define the &ldquo;place&rdquo;.  There seems like a long blurry path from highway to street to pedestrian to storefront to inside-building and so on down to the name on an office cubicle.  The difference for me is communication vs. legibility. At 100 kilometers per hour on a strange highway at night just reading it quickly is the issue. While walking around a pedestrian shopping/dining area seeing the sights brings in more of the communication angle.  I don&rsquo;t think there is a formula, I just think designers have to approach way-finding as a much broader problem than just the readability of road signs at highway speeds.</p>

Until our reseach showed that CearviewHwy was superior, they were perfectly happy with their FHWA Highway Gothic. If the next iteration is too radical in its appearence, it may be a very difficult journey towards acceptance. Also if the next big thing is too hard to manufacture (in the Highway would that would mean cutting it our of reflective material) because it contains too many subtile details, again it could be a difficult journey. (ClearviewHwy is a pretty conservative design, and it took 14 years to develop and be accepted)</div>

It seems to me that the decision makers for highway signage are most likely committees of government bureaucrats who only feel comfortable if they can just do what was done previously because of their &ldquo;that is the way we have always done it&rdquo; mentality.  (They may only have contact with designers every decade or so when the signs wear out.) 
I would be curious to know more on your method of educating them and how you finally got them to &ldquo;see the light&rdquo;.</p>
<p>By the way, it was a pleasure meeting you at TypeCon.</p>

<p>James (or anyone else), do you think there are radical changes that could be made to highway signage typefaces now that would blow the minds of the powers that be and thus be rejected at bored level? If so, I&rsquo;d love to know what they might be. Maybe they are too radical for us? Maybe we&rsquo;re no more ready for these innovations than the ultra-conservative suits.</p>
<p>When I talked earlier about plateauing, I guess I was suggesting that, with characters/glyphs/whatever, design evolution happens to some extent until a kind of form plateau is reached. Then there maybe a sudden, significant leap, by &ldquo;accident&rdquo; (?) rather than a survival of the fittest among the characters that have gone before. Can you have such a leap if it changes the known forms of existing charaters? How does that work?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have pictures, but I found the El Paso airport signage really charming and distinctive. It was done in <a href="http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Eagle">Eagle</a>.</p>
<p>This type is really strong, and has an interesting history. Morris Fuller Benton designed it as all caps for Roosevelt&rsquo;s National Recovery Association, and David Berlow drew a lower case for it and revived it for Fount Bureau.</p>
<p>At the airport they used both the U &amp; lc, in a heavy weight, bold or black. In spite of the distorted outlines and small counters of the heavy weights, it is quite readable. And, because of the setting on the Mexican border the heavy lettering seemed somehow very Tex-Mex in that setting.</p>
<p>To me this example says a few things about signage.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Outside the highway setting, where split seconds matter a lot, many types can work as signage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aesthetics and branding are often very important and valuable in a signage system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think Nick Shinn made both these points in an earlier thread about signage, but the use of Eagle is a striking example, because it is really not what one would think of first for signage, but it works admirably. It is a small airport, so wayfinding is not a huge matter, I must admit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Originally, when I was involved in the NPS stuff, Don Meeker and I proposed that the Park Service use Syntax instead of the Clarendon for their highway signature face. We also proposed using it in place of all the Helvetica Bold they were using throughout their wayfinding and publications systems. I even drew a version of Syntax to match the weight and x-height to cap proportion of their Helvetica Bold (so maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t notice!)</p>
<p>Well after what felt like a 12 hour meeting they rejected Syntax in all its forms because it was too &ldquo;Quirky&rdquo;. I beleieve that was the word they used. They just couldn&rsquo;t get past the splayed M and the angular terminals (and there were designers making these comments). They chose instead Sabon. The Sabon was a non-starter as a highway face, so that began my process of designing the Rawlinson Roadway as a way of satisfying their desire to have an &ldquo;Oldstyle&rdquo; type of face for their signature, that would also work well as a highway signage face. Reseach showed that the final version of the design performed 11% or so better than the Clarendon. It also took up less space.</p>
<p>I was going to do a presentation on this process at TypeCon in San Francisco, but my summer got bogged down with other things and I had to put it off.</p>

<p>I am definitely not in favor of ever using an all capitals system for wayfinding signage. Incorporating a small caps system might be possible, but I think all caps is not a good idea. To me, all capitals forces the reader to actually recognize each individual character rather than read a full word. I think it lengthens reaction time.</p>
<p>Based on what I&rsquo;ve read and experimented with, word shapes are important in immediate word recognition. Since we most frequently read mixed case words, it seems most appropriate to use mixed case words on signage.</p>

<p>More than likely, if money is to be spent on upgrading road and traffic signage, the bureaucrats will look to the latest accepted studies, and frankly, changing letterforms on static signage is nowhere near the top. <a href="http://www.library.unt.edu/gpo/ota/tech/safety/ap12.html" target="new"><em>Guidelines on the use of Changeable Message Signs</em></a> and <em>Summary Report</em> have already been drafted and accepted by the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration.

<p>If you think about it, more than likely these signs will be controlled centrally at transportation centers using computer consoles. I&rsquo;m sure loading in new type fonts is no more difficult than on the Mac or Pc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m in the midst of a conundrum here. A couple months ago, I spent a couple weeks bumming around some of the US&rsquo;s finer national parks (Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, and Rocky Mountain) and was really heavily into all the Clarendon signage everywhere. As has been <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/70242.html">documented elsewhere</a> on Typophile, I&rsquo;m obsessed with Clarendon, but even still, white on brown Clarendon is both aesthetically appealing to the grown-up type nerd and sentimentally appealing to the grown-up kid who spent a lot of his childhood in national parks.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s not terribly easy to read, especially when it&rsquo;s dim or raining. The Clarendon used by the NPS isn&rsquo;t blessed with an especially tremendous x-height, and the quirky details that make it so appealing up close can make it hard to read from a distance. My girlfriend and I missed a bunch of turnoffs because we didn&rsquo;t see the signs we needed in time (although the type was only part of the reason for that, which points to Terry&rsquo;s larger point that wayfinding is about a lot more than type). By any reasonable yardstick NPS Roadway&rsquo;s a big improvement. I&rsquo;m glad they stuck with a serif typeface, as much as I love Syntax and its descendants, because moving to a modern humanist sans would have been a major shock. That said, I&rsquo;ll be sad to see Clarendon go. In some ways, it <em>is</em> the National Park System to me.</p>
<p>As a side note, it&rsquo;s fun to see how long it takes to find out where the name &ldquo;Grand Tetons&rdquo; originates inside the official park brochures and maps. Talk about burying the lead&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Also, to pick up Norberto&rsquo;s point, if we&rsquo;re going to talk about wayfinding in general, not just driving, I think we have to sort of shift gears and talk about screen fonts. More and more of the information needed to get around airports, train stations, and bus stations is only available from computerized displays, and leaving aside horrible interface designs (which abound), most of the time Frutiger or Helvetica would be a huge improvement over what&rsquo;s actually getting used. Even Arial or Comic Sans would be an improvement (well, OK, given the quality of the displays, maybe not). Airport displays are one of the few environments more hostile to type than the Web, I&rsquo;d say.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Terry, I&rsquo;m the biggest word-silhouette-matters guy around, so I certainly agree that mixed-case is far superior for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; reading. What makes me open to the idea that all-caps might be better for highway signage is the issue of visibility (they&rsquo;re bigger in the same surface area) versus familiarity (where proper names don&rsquo;t benefit much). I&rsquo;m just unsure. It&rsquo;s interesting that signage has its own particular complexities compared to immersive reading - it&rsquo;s not as obvious as it might first seem, while the appreciation of immersive reading gets complex <strong>fast</strong>. But I do have to admit that James is pretty convincing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James has gained enormous ground and credibility in demonstrating that yes, a type designer can get you a better, more functional typeface than a bunch of engineers with compasses.</p>
<p>Nick asks if any solutions we might propose could scare away committees of highway planners. I think anything that looks different will scare away these kinds of viewers. James' experience demonstrates this. It makes sense: Why should they appropriate millions in funds to change something unless there&rsquo;s a real benefit? The design has to be tested (as has been done with Clearview), and the results showing specific benefits are the real bargaining chip. Beyond that, I think the design has to be superficially conventional in style, something familiar and safe, to satisfy the committee urge to please everyone in the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.terrestrialdesign.com/TransitTest01.gif">This test</a> is meant to push the possibilites of early recognition and reduce ambiguity as much as possible. In the current context, it would never be shown to a highway commission. Still, I&rsquo;m intrigued that we might discover something new about what features or qualities improve recognition most, in special cases like highways and subway systems. This design, or something derived from it, could easily be proposed to a local transit agency because the eventual style of it could fit into an identity program. Oddly enough the caps in this sample are not unlike what Kindersley proposed. I discovered this after making the test shapes. It&rsquo;s about function.</p>

<p>Very true. Kudos to him. However, let&rsquo;s not ignore the fact that the engineers gave us -or least people at large- confidence in the functional merits of the new design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The design has to be &hellip;</p>

<p>Also, <strong>timing</strong> is very important I&rsquo;d say, especially when any &ldquo;politics&rdquo; is involved.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Your trial there looks pretty cool I think. Although, as you suspect, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine government people liking it&hellip; But I think with some taming (like less stroke flaring, a more modest &ldquo;el&rdquo;, etc.) it might just fly under some people&rsquo;s radar well enough. The &ldquo;a&rdquo; though needs to lose its heavy terminal. But it&rsquo;s great, work on it some more! It&rsquo;s clear, from things like the abbreviated bowl of the &ldquo;g&rdquo;*, that you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<ul>
<li>BTW, yhy not a binocular one?</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, the Kindersley effect in the caps struck me too!</p>
