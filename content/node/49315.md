  would I embed unconventional fonts into a web page, much like the headings on this
  forum are?  I want to use various Opentype fonts in web page that are selectable,
  and spiderable by search engines like Google.  Even if the viewer doesnt have the
  font installed on their system, I want them to be able to see it.  Is this possible?"

    want if the font is very unique. '

    are movements afoot to allow HTML/CSS to either refer to regular desktop fonts
    on web servers (supported by Safari and perhaps Chrome) or to EOT fonts on web
    servers (supported by Internet Explorer).\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I don't understand how this works.\r\n\r\nDoes the web page require to be
    displayed in a certain font in order to be viewed by the viewer. Then, a freely
    distributed font is downloaded to be then installed by the user. After the font
    is installed, only then the web page can be viewed?\r\n\r\nOr does this process
    occur automatically?"

    document featuring:\r\n\r\n- Dynamic text\r\n- Embedded characters\r\n- Configured
    as selectable\r\n- Configured to be rendered as HTML\r\n\r\nI just used this method
    to create text on a webpage that behaves much like regular text.  Apparently Google
    (and others, including Yahoo!) are now indexing .swf files."

  body: "SiFR is a very smart tool. Your html source-code is not flash but just xhtml:\r\n\r\nFrom
    the sIFR website:\r\n<cite>\r\nYour (X)HTML document starts off with its standard
    styles. Then, once sIFR determines it will run, your html and body tags are classed
    with \u201C.sIFR-hasFlash\u201D. This is done in order to accomplish two things:
    1) to hide your browser text as the method is running, and 2) to create \u201Cdecoy\u201D
    styles for the text you are replacing. Decoy styles are never seen by the user.
    They are meant to adjust the space the browser text takes up before the measurement
    and replacement occurs.\r\n</cite>\r\nhttp://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/\r\n\r\nSo,
    there is no need for the search-engine to index flashfiles...\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nhttp://www.sprachkasse.de/blog\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"

    issues for doing large amounts of text with it. Even some fo the co-inventors
    of SiFR have said publicly that they just see it as a stop-gap until something
    more reasonable is implemented.\r\n\r\n@Go: Yes, it's all automatic, when it is

    to use! Of course... for Dynamic texts and so. For static text there is no need
    for embed... so... the really best way... is to avoid! ehehe maybe adobe and the
    html developers and so will find a way to embed the font on the website without
    performance issues!\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // yrmk\r\nsound & visual"

  body: "SiFR <em>is</em> flash, generated by a javascript-solution that works fine
    for headlines. There is also image-based generated solutions with php etc. but
    this is also just working for headlines and shorter texts.\r\nFor longer texts
    I don't think there is no other way to go than flash, if you want a bit more typographic
    and anti-aliasing control than in html based text. To get text in flash avalible
    for search engines, the best way I think is to add the text as a comment in the
    html document that holds the flash file."
