body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am using VOLT for the first time for a Syriac font. I am building
  each feature one by one to catch any problems then compiling and proofing.\r\n\r\nI
  have the script as \u201CSyriac\u201D and the language is \u201CDefault.\u201D So
  far I just have added the Mark to Base (mark) feature. I have set up 2 base glyphs
  to test each with 3 above marks. It complies fine and the letters show up in the
  proofing tool but when I hit the complete button the anchors don\u2019t link to
  the base glyph. I have tried this in one of the test fonts to see that the software
  works and it does. I am not sure what I am missing. I have double checked in the
  \u201Clook up\u201D window and the marks are in the correct place and locked. The
  \u201CProcess Marks\u201D are set to \u201CALL\u201D and the \u201CProcess Base
  Glyphs\u201D is checked. I have the language direction set to \u201CRTL.\u201D\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nFrances\r\n"
