Topics at TypeCon cover a broad range of interests, including typography, type design, font production, graphic design, new media, printing history, calligraphy and hand lettering, the book arts, advertising, type in motion, literacy, type sales and marketing, legal issues, type and design education, and other related areas.

In order to consider your proposal, we will need the following:

- presentation/workshop/tour title
- a concise one-paragraph description of your topic (up to 100 words)

CALL FOR SPEAKERS FOR THE TYPECON2009 TYPE AND DESIGN EDUCATION FORUM
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Society of Typographic Aficionados (SOTA) will present its fourth Type and Design Education Forum as part of TypeCon2009. This special program will be held on Thursday, July 16, at the Grand Hyatt Atlanta in Buckhead. The forum will be devoted to addressing issues faced by type educators and the institutions they represent. The program will feature presentations in conjunction with breakout sessions dedicated to the open exchange of ideas and experiences.

We are looking for presenters in the following areas:

Assignment Presentations
15-minute presentations of effective and stimulating assignments that generate a passion for type:
- Basic skill sets/foundations of type/typography
- Basic lettering/letterform design
- Type history/typographic history
- Experimentation with type

We are looking for facilitators for:

Breakout Sessions
There will be a general session consisting of small breakout discussions. We are looking for people to facilitate discussions on the following topics:
- Curriculum development for junior/community colleges
- Curriculum development for schools with 1–2 type classes
- Curriculum development for design programs with 3–4 type classes
- Curriculum development for liberal arts programs with 3–4 type classes
- Teaching type/typography basics
- Teaching letterform design
- Font selection: how to teach students to do font explorations, and make appropriate choices
- Strategies for more effective critiques
- Teaching calligraphy as a means to developing an appreciation of letterforms
- Experimentation in typography
- Type in motion
- Interactive/web type
- Multi-lingual typography

We are considering adding a new component to the Education Forum this year - a series of hands-on workshops designed specifically for educators. Workshops will run approximately 3 hours, and should be geared toward smaller groups (15-25 participants per session). If you have an idea for a workshop for educators and would like to lead your peers, please submit a proposal with supporting documentation. We are open to all ideas for this exciting new opportunity.

Submissions
Proposals should contain your biography/resume/CV, your area(s) of interest/specialty, a description of your proposed presentation and/or breakout session, and a statement about why you’d like to participate. Please include a speaking reference if you have not previously presented at a TypeCon event.

Please send all submissions to Ilene Strizver and Nancy Rorabaugh, SOTA Education Committee chairs, at education@typecon.com. Deadline for submissions is February 20, 2009.

Nope, too much of a goody two-shoes.  I park illegally now all the time, but thankfully they don't care about scooters and motorcycles and where we park at.

Can you show something in the 5¢ to 10¢ range?

"Maybe we should have a debate about the meaning of rhythm as it might apply to type and reading."

Maybe there should be a debate about the meaning of rhythm as it might apply to music and dancing first, see how that works, and then if the bad dancers wanted to help the bad scientists prepare, they'd have a chance. ;)
