    a way to convert an OT to TT?"

    a lot of OTF are simply converted old TTF or Type1!"

  body: "<strong>canderson</strong>: It's a server thing. The plug-in that converts
    our webpages to PDFs only uses TrueType. Also, this has been a problem with FileMaker
    server printing layouts in the past, though not sure if it's a problem still with
    FM 11 or not. We've simply had ongoing problems with non-graphic design applications.
    Apparently, most computer engineers aren't aware of the move to OpenType.\r\n\r\n<strong>JanekZ</strong>:
    Thanks for the tip. I also found TransType, but FontForge seems to be OpenSource.\r\n\r\n*
    And we've always used PS fonts in the past, so our TT library is pretty much what
    was installed with OS and software and no more. I haven't been able to find a
    TT version of <em>any</em> Garamond in our archive fonts."

    violation. (Assuming you've licensed it. *wink*)

    All TTFs are (or should be) Truetype, while an OTF can be either one of them.\r\n\r\nIt
    sounds like Margaux' server can only use Truetype format fonts, independent of

  body: Why convert to truetype when you can buy as truetype. Adobe only offers Opentype,
    but other foundries also offer truetype, like bitstream and URW++. I'd advise
    you to just look for Garamond in MyFonts, as there are loads of different versions,
    there should be one that suits your needs.
