  for Windows. After installing this free software I can see a new folder on my hard
  disk with some Adobe OpenType fonts (Myriad Pro, Minion Pro and Courier Std). Since
  Adobe Reader is a free software I suppose these great fonts are a free gift from
  Adobe. Am I right? Can I use these fonts for commercial projects? Where can I get
  the license agreement?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nalbertoxic"

  body: "As far as I understand it the use of Adobe's bundled fonts is governed by
    the EULA for the software, of which the font is a part. <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrreula.html\">see
    Section 1 subsection iii</a> <cite><strong>1. Definitions.</strong> \"Software\"
    means (a) all of the contents of the files, disk(s), CD-ROM(s) or other media
    with which this Agreement is provided, including but not limited to (i) Adobe
    or third party computer information or software; (ii) related explanatory written
    materials or files (\"Documentation\"); and (iii) fonts; and (b) upgrades, modified
    versions, updates, additions, and copies of the Software, if any, licensed to
    you by Adobe (collectively, \"Updates\"). ... </cite>\r\nSo the font is governed
    by the same EULA as Acrobat Reader."

  body: "This topic has come up before. The problem I have with understanding the
    EULA is that it is difficult to interpret the rest of the agreement in terms of
    using the fonts as such. For example, the paragraph about \"No Modification\"
    puts restrictions on how other software may interface with the Software, but these
    only make sense when talking about interfacing with Acrobat Reader: i.e. creating
    plug-ins for it, or integrating it into other applications. You really have to
    stretch the meaning to understand such \"interfacing\" in terms of the fonts.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Albertoxic, can you link us to the EULA? I'd be interested in reading it.

  body: "Hi Tiffany,\r\nfonts bundled with Acrobat Reader have not a specific license
    agreement. Probably their use is governed by Acrobat Reader's license: http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrreula.html\r\n\r\nBut,
    as Glyn Adgie said, it's not so simple to interpret the software EULA regarding
    bundled fonts...\r\n"
