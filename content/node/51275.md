    on the faces of everybody in Manhattan. You could see the silence and stunned
    looks in the streets, in the subway. \r\n\r\nThis time, people spontaneously poured
    out in the streets to celebrate publicly, jumping up and down and shouting. People
    were dancing in the streets and hugging strangers. The coolest event my daughter
    saw was on 14th, West of Union Square; there people were doing percussion on the
    metal newspaper sales boxes, and a telephone booth, and one guy drumming on a
    plastic bucket. She said it was like a scene out of the musical \"Stomp!\". Everyone
    who wasn't drumming was dancing, everybody was hugging each other. And a guy with
    a trombone came alone and played to the beat. \r\n\r\nWalking through the more
    deserted streets--after midnight--when she would see somebody they would spontaneously
    shout \"Yippee! Yahoo!\" And she back. She said she'd never seen anything like
    it. I haven't either. "
