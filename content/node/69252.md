body: "Problem:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GREP-kern-1_6550.gif]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nWhile
  InDesign CS4 doesn't feature a kerning table, it does support GREP styles, which
  can be used to apply custom kerning values to extended text settings. Because I
  haven't seen this documented in a truly helpful way (not that I've looked <em>too</em>
  hard) and some peeps have asked about it, here's a quick writeup of a possible procedure.
  Maybe if some of you have corrections or suggestions how to do it better, we can
  put together a killer workflow. (Scuse the atypically looong post\u2026 I figured
  Typophile was still the best place to put this.)\r\n\r\nSo in the text above, note
  the absence of a kern pair for \xABT\xF3\xBB while \xABTo\xBB looks fine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Step
  1: Kern the pair manually, once.</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GREP-kern-2_6377.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n<strong>Step
  2: Define character style for kern pair.</strong>\r\nIt seems that this has to be
  done in a roundabout way, since custom kerning values cannot be entered in the Character
  Style dialog.\r\nIt's interesting to note that while InDesign only lets you insert
  a kerning value when the cursor is between the 2 glyphs in question, it seems that
  the kerning value is treated as a <em>property assigned to the first glyph in the
  pair</em>. Thus, by selecting the first one of these 2 glyphs and then defining
  a \xABNew Character Style\xBB you will be able to make a character style that contains
  this kerning value. (You want to pay attention that it doesn't contain anything
  else.) I'd name it something telling, like kern_T_oacute in this case. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GREP-kern-3_6202.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n<strong>Step
  3: Apply this Character Style to all occurrences of the pair in question, via GREP.</strong>\r\nMake
  sure your text cursor is in one paragraph in question, then select \xABGREP Styles\xBB
  from the Paragraph (not Paragraph Styles) palette flyout. Hit \xABNEW GREP Style\u2026\xBB
  and specify to assign the kern_T_oacute character style in case this condition is
  met:\r\n<code>T(?=\xF3)</code>\r\nThe important thing is to only assign the character
  style to the \"T\" (as the kerning value is treated as a property of the <em>first</em>
  glyph in the pair), but <strong>only if it is followed by \"\xF3\"</strong> &ndash;
  this condition is what the (?=\xF3) specifies as a Positive Lookahead (cf. <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/InDesign/6.0/WSa285fff53dea4f8617383751001ea8cb3f-6f59a.html\">Adobe
  Guideline on Metacharacters</a>). If you want to include other possibilities too
  (like odieresis), you can specify a class of possible second glyphs in brackets,
  like in the screenshot below.\r\nWhen you hit Preview this baby should now automagically
  apply to all \xABT\xF3\xBB pairs in the paragraph:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GREP-kern-4_3891.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n<strong>Step
  4: Redefine Paragraph Style to include GREP style.</strong>\r\nYour Paragraph Style
  will now have a \"+\" added because the GREP style was added. Select \xABRedefine
  Style\xBB to add the GREP style to the Paragraph Style definition. Now the custom
  kern pair should automatically be applied in all paragraphs based on this paragraph
  style. (Note that you'll have to do this for all paragraph styles you need the kern
  pair in.)\r\n\r\nComments, suggestions, please shoot. I will add that in my case
  I actually solved it differently (via GREP Search&Replace) but found out later that
  this way would have been much more elegant."

  body: "Back in Ye Olden Tymes, when \"typesetter\" was a profession, kerning was
    generally accomplished with a search-and-replace function after the text had been
    keyed in. Additions or exceptions to the standard pairs could easily be added
    to the swap file, so adjustments like this were no big deal. Sadly, the advent
    of desktop publishing and \"idiot-proof\" interfaces removed a certain level of
    control. This is one reason why--until Corel fouled up the works with Version
    8--I always preferred WordPerfect to Microsoft Word: one had access to the underlying
    code, and global changes were easily accomplished with search-and-replace.\r\n\r\nOther
    things I miss from the days of yore: controllable vertical justification (one
    could add more or less space between selected elements) and Auto-tabs (the longest
    entry in an ordered or unordered list could be centered, and all other entries
    flush left with it). Sigh..."

  body: "Hey, Nina, great trick! I do have two additional remarks:\r\n\r\nTo act upon
    <strong>each and every 'o'-like character</strong>, accented or not, you don't
    have to list the exact list. You can still use it if you need absolute control
    on which characters to include, but if you are positive you want to do this on
    all 'o' characters, you can use a <em>character class</em>: the command <code>&#91;&#91;=o=&#93;&#93;</code>
    will match on all o's, with and without accent. The only drawback is that a capital
    Oh is also an equivalent of plain 'o', so you have to find a way to exclude them.
    Well -- you can add <em>another</em> lookahead to include <em>only</em> lowercase
    characters!\r\n\r\n<code>T(?=\\l)(?=&#91;&#91;=o=&#93;&#93;)</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    first lookahead asserts only lowercase characters may follow; the second picks
    up all equivalents of plain ohs.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is: Unfortunately, GREP
    styles are oblivious to <strong>formatting</strong>, so this same trick will be
    applied to italic, bold, and bold italic, and on every font as well. If you are
    applying italics formatting though a paragraph style, you can create a new character
    style for \"italic T o\" kerning, but for plain text you still have to apply manually
    workarounds to non-plain text.\r\n\r\nGiven this constraint, it's still a great
    trick. I agree: it's about time Adobe copied the Quark Kerning Pair Editor. And
    does anyone else think it's weird you cannot enter a Kerning value in a Character
    Style definition? You can only insert one using Nina's trick: first apply, then
    \"Define New Character Style\". And if you got it wrong, you cannot <em>edit</em>
    it. (Perhaps it can be done with a Javascript -- I'll have to check that.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n

  body: "Thanks for the responses. I'm glad if this is helpful to some.\r\n\r\nTheunis,
    thank you very much for the input! I'm actually quite a newbie at GREP so these
    more advanced syntax constructions are quite illuminating. \r\nUsing that blanket
    character class wildcard (like <code>=o=</code>) seems like a bit of a dangerous
    technique from a type design perspective no? I mean considering that say the oacute
    and odieresis might need quite different kerning values when following a \"T\",
    depending on the design.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Unfortunately, GREP styles are oblivious
    to formatting\"</cite>\r\nYes, this is really quite a bad constraint. I should
    have mentioned it. It's pretty stupid actually because if you do a GREP <em>search</em>
    then you <em>can</em> specify formatting (like in normal searches),* just not
    for GREP <em>styles</em>. Hmph.\r\n(* I'm not quite sure, but there seems to be
    a problem here too: In the GREP Search, if any formatting is specified, not only
    the search term proper needs to match this formatting at but also the Lookahead
    too. Which is exactly a problem for this technique, since you'd only want to match
    the first glyph of the pair in terms of formatting. So if you have a pair like
    say \"V\xED\" and the \"\xED\" already has a custom character style applied, and
    you search for \"V(?=\xED)\" with standard formatting it's not going to be found.
    :-\\ )\r\nThe interface for these functions definitely needs refining, and I don't
    only mean a nice clickable GUI here, although that'd be rad too.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"does
    anyone else think it's weird you cannot enter a Kerning value in a Character Style
    definition? You can only insert one using Nina's trick: first apply, then \"Define
    New Character Style\"\"</cite>\r\nI'm thinking my \"trick\" might be a loophole.
    This is likely not <em>meant</em> to be done this way (or at all). Otherwise there
    would be a better interface for it. But I might be wrong.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"And if
    you got it wrong, you cannot edit it.\"</cite>\r\nWell you can edit it locally
    in one instance and then \"Redefine Style\". Which works, but is also a workaround.
    OK, hack. :-)\r\n\r\nNow of course the big question to the Adobe folks is, will
    any of this be improved in CS5?\r\n"
