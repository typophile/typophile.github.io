body: There seems to be a lot of interest here in designing or discussing low-resolution
  bitmapped fonts. <BR> <BR>OpenType fonts have a feature that allows bitmapped glyphs
  for specific point sizes, optimizing on-screen display.  Has anyone tried doing
  this? <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: 'I&#39;ve experimented with this a little bit Paul, but I&#39;m no technical
    wizard, so for your own safety, doubt everything I say here. As far as I&#39;m
    aware, your OpenType font has to be TTF flavored - not CFF. I work in FontLab,
    so if you use that, try the following: <BR> <BR>1&#41; open a glyph <BR>2&#41;
    Tools&#62;Operations&#62;TrueType Hinting <BR>3&#41; turn on the Bitmap tool &#40;see
    below&#41; <BR>4&#41; right click in the glyph window <BR>5&#41; select Generate
    Bitmap <BR> <BR>You have to generate bitmaps individually for each glyph, for
    each ppem you want to support, as far as I know. <BR> <BR>Hope that&#39;s helpful.

    target="_blank"> FontLab manual</a> - looks like pages 560-575 contain a reasonable
    explanation of importing/exporting bitmaps, TrueType hinting and such. <BR> <BR>Cheers.

  body: 'I came across something on it when I was reading through Adobe&#39;s somewhat
    technical Opentype specifications.  It seems like a good way to create a font
    to work for bitmapped work and print work.  It&#39;s probably a lot easier than
    painstakingly hinting fonts to pixel-perfection like Verdana or Georgia have been,
    and it would let you accentuate features &#40;serifs, swashes, etc.&#41; at tiny
    bitmapped sizes that would normally disappear. <BR> <BR>Nathan: I imagine that
    in Fontlab, you could probably highlight multiple glyphs and do the bitmap-generating
    operation, right? <BR> <BR>Paul'

    Glyph window view to access the hinting operations, so it&#39;s a one-by-one type
    thing. I&#39;ve found they usually need a lot of tweaking anyway, so it&#39;s
    not a big deal having to go one by one. '

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not a Fontlab user, so how an OTF can be &#34;TTF flavored&#34;,
    Nathan? Does the forced-hinting technique works for multiple sizes? '

  body: As far as I know, an OTF font can contain either PostScript outlines, or TrueType
    outlines &#40;i.e., its flavor&#41;. It&#39;s my assumption that hinting is dependent
    on whichever type of outline is in the OTF file.  <BR> <BR>And, like BitFonter,
    I believe that FontLab can only output TTF files with embedded bitmaps in them.

  body: I&#39;ve had a little experience with embedded bitmaps. My &#40;free&#41;
    font <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html" target="_blank">
    Anonymous</a>, a Mac/Windows TrueType font, uses them for the Windows version.
    &#40;The Mac version has them in the suitcase file.&#41;  <BR> <BR>It works, but
    it depends on OS support &#40;and application support sometimes&#41; for it to
    work properly. On MacOS 9 &#40;and earlier&#41; and Windows they are used instead
    of the TT rasterizer at the sizes that you would expect. MacOS X uses the bitmaps
    only when they fall below its anti-aliasing threshhold, otherwise it ignores them.  <BR>
    <BR>Flash will use them &#40;yay!&#41; if the font is installed on the client
    system for dynamic and input text, but not &#40;boo!&#41; for static text and
    not for anything when you embed the font in the swf. <BR> <BR>Also, the size at
    which they are used on Windows differs from Macs in the usual way. In other words,
    if you have embedded a 12-pixel tall bitmap font, it will appear at 12-point on
    Macs but at 8-point on Windows &#40;assuming that the Windows default 96-dpi setting
    has not been changed&#41;.
