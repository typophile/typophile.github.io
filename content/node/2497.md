body: Hi  folks,  <BR> <BR>I saw this ID request today, and it&#39;s been driving
  me crazy. I know I have seen this font, but I can&#39;t for the moment recall where
  I saw it. I even think I may have this font in my collection, which pretty much
  means it would be a commercial font, not freeware. <BR> <BR>Anybody recognize it?<img

  body: That&#39;s it Adriano! And I do have the font, but with no annotation in the
    file itself about the source.  Is Luxemburg the original name, and &#39;Luxembourg&#39;
    the &#39;clone&#39;? &#40;my file has the latter spelling&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    thanks for the quick ID.

    found two other Mac-to-PC conversions &#40;Alltype and <BR>Reasonable Solutions&#41;

    &#40;a bit less than <BR>halfway down; Fonts Disk #6&#41; is an offering of a
    1995 Mac <BR>floppy disk that includes Luxembourg. Perhaps the original? <BR>
    <BR>The fonts on those disks bring names like Mike Allard, <BR>Marty Bee, Rick
    Mueller, David Rakowski, Sam Wang, and <BR>others to mind. <BR><br>'

  body: Yes, It&#39;s Luxembourg, sorry. The first time I got this font was also a
    MAC file back in 95 on the Irreligious Layout &#40;from Moonspell&#41; I&#39;ll
    ask the original designer where did he got it. I have 3 versions of this font,
    the MAC, the dafont &amp; the Alltype one...
