  body: "Given the fact that the sign is a neon light construction, it's not so easy
    to find an actual digital font corresponding to the original design. The \"NFL\"
    looks probably custom/deformed and the \"N\" of \"MAN\" looks 180 degrees rotated.\r\n\r\nYou
    can try to approximate it by modifying a similar font e.g. <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-2&ffam=RitaSmith%20-%20Medium&fid=d9f36fa6574f32caa1e350215e437f87&fsize=60&text=THE%20NFL%20MAN&fit=1|Rita

  body: There was no "old NFL logo font", just part of a designed logo. There are
    some fonts such as the one Fivos suggested, that could be deformed to match.  In
    all likelihood, you'll never find a font with an "N" like that, with one oval
    serif and one rounded triangular serif.
