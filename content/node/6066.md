  the real name for it? What do you call it? Personally, I like  <BR>the term because
  camels are mostly ugly creatures and so is that  <BR>setting most of the time. <BR>
  <BR>camelCase: as in the syntax used by programmers in terms like  <BR>&#34;openWindow&#34;
  or &#34;startNow.&#34; <BR> <BR>CamelCase as in the format used for every new product
  trying to <BR>seem hip. iTunes, eCommerce, iPhoto. <BR> <BR>I can see the new Adobe
  apps adding camel case to their list  <BR>of cases you can convert your text to.'

  body: 'The more common term is &#34;intercap&#34;. And if I were being picky, I&#39;d
    say that DromedaryCase would be more accurate. :-&#41;  And here&#39;s a typographic
    twist: the &#34;D&#34; in Dromedary has one &#34;hump&#34; while the &#34;B&#34;
    in Bactrian has two! <BR> <BR>BTW, how do you judge beauty? To me, functionality,
    resilience, self-sufficiency are beautiful. Try leaving a Golden Retriever in
    the desert for a day, much less weeks. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Here we call it CamelCaps. I like both the alliteration and the concept of
    a camel as horse ala committee.

  body: Don&#39;t know what its called, but know what its for. <BR> <BR>In programming
    &amp; scripting its used because spaces are not available. <BR> <BR>In global
    branding its used because the marketing divisions of those companies have the
    imagination of a landfill site. <BR>
