    was used in your 1990 book, and noted that there was usually a simplification
    of the typeface in text sizes compared to the headings or display sizes. The commercial
    digitized Fraktur fonts mostly show a crispness and detail not found in the old
    body type.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WalbaumFraktur_5398.jpg]\r\nBefore
    1941, when the Nazi's condemned Fraktur to the trash can, there were hundreds
    of Fraktur fonts. Only a few survived for post-war use. \r\nIn addition to the
    standard Fraktur fonts sold today by the major digital foundaries there is an
    interesting assortment at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.romana-hamburg.de/\r\n\r\nMake certain
    to download the gro\xDFer PDF-Schriftmuster-Katalog:\r\nhttp://www.romana-hamburg.de/Schriftmappe.pdf\r\n\r\nYou
    might find a closer match to your specimen.\r\n\r\nBTW, I wonder how many people
    in 2013 can actually read an extended text in Fraktur, especially where there
    is a lot of uppercase.\r\nDon"

  body: "I didn't express myself very clearly in my previous post. I failed to distinguish
    readability and understanding.\r\n\r\n1. Readability:\r\nI admire the punchcutters
    of the metal type era for their ability to simplify Fraktur for use as body text.
    \r\nThe sample is a good example of a successful simplification and is quite readable
    at small text sizes.\r\nModern digitizations almost always are from the old display
    size designs and work poorly as text because of the extreme contrast between thick
    strokes and hairlines. They would need optical scaling and flourish clipping to
    be readable as extended text.\r\n\r\n2. Understanding:\r\nMost of the Fraktur
    lower case, except for a few letters such as the upside down k, r based x and
    long tail z can be understood by contemporary readers. Readable text versions
    could have some appeal.\r\nBut the Fraktur uppercase, no matter how simplified
    would remain a mystery without major redesign. Some attempts to do this from about
    1900 to 1940, such as Koch's German script, have the potential to be adapted for
    contemporary readers.  Some designers simply replaced the Fraktur uppercase with
    a Latin one. In my opinion none of the Fraktur-Latin hybrid upper cases including
    the one mentioned at the microfoundry site are effective.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"

    and only show five UC letters (B, D, F, K, T). If you mean that a blackletter
    font isn't a blackletter font unless it has the traditional (read: difficult to
    decipher for modern readers) UC structures, I can't agree; a style is never merely
    about its specific components.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      such as Schwabachers, Rotundas etc. which have less intimidating upper cases.
      There are many readable non-Fraktur blackletters, by various designers from
      Behrens to Morris.\r\nDon"
