    graphic designers, offering comprehensive ready-to-go solutions for every occasion,
    up to \u201Cfamilies\u201D of varied typefaces (serif, sans, catchwords, dingbats,
    etc.) all designed to be different but still work together."

  body: "Although I have mixed feelings about such a solution, I do think it's wise
    for type designers to become more involved in the design process of what the typefaces
    are intended for. On the one hand a graphic designer should know best how to use
    type within a certain layout, in practice most graphic designers seriously lack
    the required knowledge to make proper decisions. For some odd reason most schools
    don't educate well on the use of typefaces and in fact in the Netherlands typographic
    education is even decreasing. As such I suspect the job of the type designer will
    only become more relevant as they're slowly taking over some of the role of a
    graphic designer. When graphic designers aren't doing their job, someone has to\u2026"

  body: "\"most graphic designers seriously lack the required knowledge..\"\r\n\r\nOne
    reason is that type is just one aspect of graphic design, and designers spend
    much of their time dealing with other things. \r\n\r\nOther aspects include gathering,
    organizing and presenting information, photography, illustration, layouts, dealing
    with clients, dealing with printers and other vendors, the business aspects of
    design, and many other things. Folks who focus full-time on fonts (like many of
    the folks here) are naturally more knowledgable."

    arrival of web design and animation to bulk up the curriculum, as well as traditional
    print skills.\r\n\r\nThe nature of typography has changed too.\r\nNow a focus
    on how it may be animated, rather than kerned."

    we're not learning all of these things at school. When I studied at the art academy
    previously in 2007 we had photography and drawing classes. Not any longer. Typography
    is such an essential part of graphic design, it really is ridiculous that we don't
    get typography class. I constantly see the most basic typography mistakes everywhere
    around me. For a profession that has to make use of typefaces to do their job
    well, they know very little about our product and how to use it. You wouldn't
    make this excuse for a car dealer who knows nothing about cars but \"knows a lot
    of other things about the industry, and the nature of mechanics have changed too\".
    I don't really see how that has any bearing on the notion that graphic designers
    no longer possess the required knowledge and skill to do their job properly.\r\n\r\nIn
    2007 we also had to learn how to code our own portfolio website. This time the
    two coding classes we had so far in 1,5 year time were an absolute joke. As for
    animation, we haven't learned a thing. I'm glad about that though. I'm glad I
    can code, but I don't want to learn animation or 3D. It's just not my focus. I
    think it's quite ridiculous how the modern graphic designer seems to have to do
    just about everything, but doesn't become an expert at most of these things."

    as much as time permitted \u2014 but it varies from college to college. An art
    academy would have a different focus from my major which was Visual Communication
    Design.\r\n\r\nDo designers know as much about typography as someone who deals
    with it full time? Of course not. Just as they don't know as much about photography
    as a professional photographer.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that I see mistakes all
    the time. Designers today often set type themselves instead of using professional
    typesetters who were more skilled.\r\n\r\nI also see bad photo scans because designers
    do it themselves instead of letting a pro do it. In some ways desktop publishing
    has been a negative for graphic design."

    in 2007 we had separate classes, so we did a lot more things. Now the system has
    changed and we work in projects rather than classes, and the layout of the school
    itself has changed to something much more open rather than separate rooms, so
    teachers and students may interact with each other more freely. As for working
    in projects, it means we get trained a lot better to function in our jobs, but
    academically speaking we're a lot less varied. As weak as the focus on typography
    on this academy is, last year I heard it's only getting worse. I was surprised
    to hear they're actually doing a third year course in Glyphs at the moment. I
    suppose it may indicate a return of focus on typography, but I think they're just
    going to let KABK do all the typography stuff.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Do designers
    know as much about typography as someone who deals with it full time? Of course
    not.</blockquote>\r\nI certainly don't expect them to, but I don't expect them
    to use hyphens for various things that have nothing to do with hyphenation either,
    or to use faux bold effects and faux small-caps. There are some basic principles
    I think every graphic designer ought to learn. I also expect them to make wiser
    choices in typefaces. That is something I actually have yet to master myself.
    As much as I know about type design, my vision regarding what I would consider
    artistic or expressive typography has a long way to go in maturing.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I feel you're somewhat downplaying the relevance of typography for a graphic designer.
    Graphic design is not about shapes but ultimately about communication. How good
    can the communication be when one of the most essential parts of it is not getting
    the attention it requires?\r\n\r\nI often feel like we're being trained as artists
    while a large part of it is perhaps not an exact science, but a lot more rational
    and less emotional. That's something I'm missing generally. There's a lot of focus
    on our ideas and process but not a lot of focus and constructive feedback on the
    execution of our projects. They will tell you what's bad, but not how to be better.
    That's something you have to work on yourself, and some people struggle with that.
    I don't, but I do feel I could potentially get a lot more out of my education."

  body: "My experience, teaching type design to third year graphic design students
    fairly recently, was that they had studied typography in \uFB01rst year, but had
    since lost the plot, presumably through inactivity in that area.\r\n\r\nFor instance,
    when making a poster to showcase their type design in text setting, they would
    just dump the text in a text box with the Paragraph defaults: Auto Leading, and
    no Paragraph Indent or extra Paragraph Leading.\r\n\r\nNothing wrong with that\u2014it\u2019s
    rather like what you\u2019re reading now\u2014but it does indicate a lack of subtlety
    and engagement."

    of differences between an art academy and the college I attended. We were not
    trained as artists, but rather as problem-solvers and communicators. It's important
    for students to pick the school and approach that works best for them.\r\n\r\nMartin
    I don't feel we're that far apart, I agree that more typographic training would
    be great. But there is a lot more to learn besides typography. And a lot of education
    takes place AFTER college.\r\n\r\nNick I agree with your comments.\r\n\r\n"
