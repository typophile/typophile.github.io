body: "When exporting an InDesign file to PDF, I noticed on several occasions, \r\nthat
  text is shifting when I used the \" Indent to Here special character\".\r\n\r\nInDesign
  moves the first (few) words to the right by appr. one space.\r\n\r\nDid you ever
  encounter this problem and is there a way to solve it ?\r\n\r\n/// Jacques"

    with Distiller. I hope Adobe will correct this bug one day...

    out of curiosity, what versions if InDesign and Acrobat were you using?"

  body: I faced the behavior described by fonthausen several times, regardless on
    fonts used. The combination of customized bullets (custom font & color) and Indent
    to Here command keeps me stressed as it appeared in one printed book I design.
    I didn't notice the problem when checking PDF files. No I always doublecheck all
    pages where I use customized bullets and indent. The other solution is not to
    use Indent to Here and rather use negative values for first line indent.
