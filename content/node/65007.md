body: "Hello all, I'm getting close to finishing a logo for a venture capital firm
  which specializes in something called cleantech ventures, basically this means they
  are raising funds for technology based start ups who are making advances in the
  alternative energy industry. My client's tastes are on the conservative side and
  after designing a lot of logos, we've finally narrowed it down to one, but there
  are strong opinions on the color across the divide between designer and client.
  I attached an image which has the logo in two color palettes and I'm hoping to see
  what you think is the better option. Also, which color has more energy, or communicates
  the idea of energy more effectively? By the way, I've presented them with many non
  blue options, the final has to be some sort of blue... THanks for the help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/terawatt_3428.gif]"

  body: I'm guessing you like the top version, the client likes the bottom? I do think
    you need more space in between the "A" and "W". I think 291 is too soft, but 286
    is too vivid. Maybe something in between?

  body: "I like it. You need to either match the spaces in AWA or join the W to the
    A. You also need to keep the weight of the A strokes the same. The color in the
    former is more pleasant but too light, the dark blue in the latter reeks of old
    Wall Street in a way that doesn\u2019t suit our times or the business."

  body: Nice logo. I agree with both. A color in between the two blues would convey
    energy and still be a sophisticated design solution. Also does need a hint more
    space between a and w.

  body: "Thanks for some fast replies. The strokes of the \"A\"'s are slightly different,
    their sort of mirrored letters so the that the side which faces the \"W\" is a
    little bit different than the outer stroke. Somewhere along the line I thought
    this would be a good idea but I guess it's just a bit distracting. Thanks for
    bringing that to my attn.\r\n\r\nI do agree that on my monitor the 291 is too
    light, the pms swatch comes across better. I guess I should either need a more
    accurate rgb value or I might need to go a bit darker if staying light is an option...\r\n"

  body: '@hrant, I did suggest that spelling early on, its a very subtle pun, they
    didn''t really get it unfortunately, but I agree that 2 R''s are better than one.
    But I''m not really sure if the idea of making every letter collide is really
    the right direction, right now some are touching in order to keep the word tightly
    kerned, and the word is split into the syllables very deliberately, since it''s
    already kind of a mouthful.'

  body: "More than having things collide, what I was shooting for was making the \"TER[R]A\"
    sort of a negative space thing (I was just inept at the rendering). One benefit
    of this would be to totally avoid the problematic diagonal separating \"AW\"*.
    Another benefit would be that you'd only need one color while still exhibiting
    a boundary between the two parts. BTW, do you think they'd go for a hyphen? Not
    necessarily textually, just visually - like in the Microsoft logo.\r\n\r\n* Hey,
    have you tried simply making them share a diagonal stroke?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: put more space between A and W. You may want to do something about that blue
    too, your close.

  body: I have one more question to ask, why do you all hate the closeness of the
    A and the W? The whole point was to create tension b/t the two halves of the word,
    and I've shown it to a few designers who appreciate that element. So what exactly
    about it do you just hate so much? Thanks for all the help.

    have the same problem with As that have no crossbar, hence I read the KIA logo
    as \"KILL\".)"

  body: to me it is just uncomfortable. Tension is interesting certainly...but the
    subject does not quite lend itself. The titles for a Hitchcock film yes...  Generally
    we always want to create harmony as designers. I think a slight adjustment would
    do it...close is good it is just claustrophobic
