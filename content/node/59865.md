body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm in the middle of designing a logo which is a chemical symbol
  that has a subscript number character. I looked through the glyph table in my fonts
  but I cannot find any suitable ones. The default Helvetica font on my Mac has a
  set of subscript glyphs that look like they are suffering from anorexia. The newer
  Linotype Helvetica fonts does not contain these glyphs.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the
  best way to achieve a good-looking and typographically-correct subscript?"

  body: "If it's 1, 2 or 3, check the superscript glyphs. Nearly every font has these.
    If it's weighted properly, you can just reposition it.\r\n\r\nFailing that, choose
    a font with a good spectrum of weights, and scale down a figure that's a step
    bolder than the main text until it seems to match. If you don't have a weight
    that fits the desired size proportion, you may be able to create it with interpolation."

  body: Kozuka Gothic Pro has non anemic subscripts and a wide range of weights. If
    you use the character palette to see which fonts have characters in the range
    U+2080-U+2089, you may  realize you own other interesting choices. In the serif
    fonts, I like the subscripts in  Hoefler text and Adobe Garamond Pro.

  body: "If it's for a logo, you may not need to get a font with proper scientific
    inferiors.\r\nJust scale and position the figure in any font you are working with,
    and stroke its outline to taste.\r\nFor a grotesque with several figure sizes,
    consider my <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/figgins.html\">Figgins Sans</a>.
    The figure options are shown on page 19 of the Modern Suite PDF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
