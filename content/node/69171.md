  the open type version.\r\nThe Q of TheSans (old version) used to have the \"tail\"
  detached from the rest of the body and it look like an eyebrow at the bottom of
  the Q, just like this Slab Serif.\r\nCan somebody help me identify it?\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much,\r\n\r\nPatty[img:sites/default/files/old-images/QC_4102.gif]"

  body: I've been trying to post the character set but typophile keeps breaking the
    link. It appears that the Q you're looking for is in the recent version. TheSans
    still has it too.
