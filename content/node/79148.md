  flat serifs, for digital use.

    it does not have flat serifs.\r\n\r\nWhat you about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/urw-bodoni/|URW

  body: "Google \"Bodoni font\" and inspect the price of what you find, and whether
    the serifs are sufficiently \"flat\".\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to visit the
    big \"department store\" online font distributors, which licence fonts from multiple
    foundries, and search \"Bodoni\" there, e.g.\r\nMyFonts\r\nFontShop\r\nFonts.com\r\nVeer\r\n"

  body: "URW Bodoni does not have an Italic though, only an Oblique. ITC Bodoni comes
    in three optical sizes and it suitable for longer text (most Bodonis are not).
    It al depends if you are looking for a Bodoni for headlines or logos or for running
    text. Bauer Bodoni is good for headlines, as is Bodoni Antiqua, both from URW,
    they are very affordable and good quality. ITC Bodoni is more suitable for text
    (the 6 and 12 pt versions) but the 72 pt version is very nice for display. It
    is less stiff in its geometry, more elegant, but very nice. [[http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/itcbodoniovervie.html|Stone
    Type Foundry]] has them at a very affordable price.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you can search
    for [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/didone/fonts/|Didone]] at MyFonts to get Bodoni-esque
    fonts"

    difference between Bodoni and Bodoni Antiqua. Could you help me?

  body: I don't know which bodoni you are referring to. All bodonis go back to the
    typefaces of gianbattista bodoni. But as he cut various typefaces, for different
    sizes, there isn't one true bodoni of which others are derivates. Bauer Bodoni
    is a very classical cut, very good for display use, but a bit too thin and wide
    for text work, as the thin lines will be very hard to read. Berthold Bodoni is
    the same as Bodoni Antiqua, it is considered another succesful cut, which is slightly
    more robust than the Bauer version, so more suitable for text, but still perhaps
    a bit too refined for that. Then there is ITC bodoni which is actually three bodonis,
    the 6 is based on gianbattista bodonis small type, the 72 based on his display
    work, and the 12 is 'generated' as a mixture of the too. overall I would say that
    ITC Bodoni is a bit more organic than the other too, and more suitable for text
    work. These are the bodonis I know well, others will differ slightly in their
    geometry, thick thin contrast, and their detailing (serifs for instance). But
    these differences seem small at first glance.

  body: I was referring to Berthold Bodoni, Berthold Bodoni Antiqua, URW Bodoni and
    URW Bodoni Antiqua. I can't notice the difference between them. And once again,
    thank you for the explanations.
