  he could find, including 8 and 10 point, etc.  ITC's Founder's Caslon, however,
  only has calson digital fonts based on the original 12 point, 30 point and 42 point

  body: "David, Founders Caslon was a wonderful achievement, and many people have
    used it successfully, and will in the future. I think there will never be a more
    authentic revival of Caslon. \r\n\r\nHowever, as I have worked on Caslon, I have
    become aware that it does have limitations even considered as the 'authentic revival'
    which, as Justin Howes said in your link, was the goal of his immense labors.
    \r\n\r\nFirst, as he says in the link you have given, he printed samples anew
    from metal with light inking, and then scanned these. The scans, no doubt cleaned
    up to some extent, became the typeface, along with some added characters he drew.
    \r\n\r\nThis lightly inked look is not the authentic look of either the original
    18th century Caslon, nor of the metal revivals well into the 20th century. As
    I understand it, in the 18th century, the technology did not give a consistent
    height-to-paper of metal types. To compensate for this, and get all the types
    to print, the types were heavily inked, and printed into dampened paper. If you
    look at 18th century examples, or the facsimile version of Caslon's 1766 specimen
    book, annotated by James Mosley (Journal of the Printing Historical Society 1981/82)
    you will see that they are far blacker than Founders' Caslon. Furthermore, the
    way Caslon was used in metal revival is that it was often heavily inked, or was
    printed on rough paper precisely to get the ink spread. \r\n\r\nIn other words,
    many people felt that the 'ink gain' of the old type was part of the distinctive,
    attractive look of Caslon. Printing of the revivals generally had less ink gain
    than the original, but still had substantial gain when printed on rough paper
    or heavily inked. Whatever inking you prefer, the fact is that Founder's Caslon
    printed by offset is not going to have the look and feel of either the original
    18th century Caslon, or even metal revivals, printed on rough paper. \r\n\r\nThere
    is a second problem I will go into in another post. \r\n "

    the lightweight problem, yes? In that case, you would have a more authentic print.

  body: "Dan, yes, if you print letter press of course when you get ink gain it will
    look more like the original, especially if you print on rough paper. So that will
    indeed approximate the old printing a lot more.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is another
    problem with authenticity in Founder's Caslon, and this is recut and damaged characters.
    For example, in the 19th century Caslon's Pica 2 italic evidently was recut with
    the slopes of the ascenders regularized. (James Mosley first pointed out the existence
    of recut characters.) Howes uses the 19th or 20th century types, which are not
    the originals. \r\n\r\nAlso there are damaged characters. The ascender of the
    roman 'h' in the Founders Caslon 12 looks like it has a broken back and broken
    serif. The same broken-back ascender is found in Linotype Caslon Old Face of 1923,
    so it probably came from the model of the same hunk of metal--which meanwhile
    seems to have gotten its serif broken also. In the 1766 specimen book, the ascender
    does slant forward, but it doesn't look 'broken'; and no broken serif. \r\n\r\nPersonally,
    what I take from all this is that authenticity is an impossible goal, unless you
    have original type or recast from original, undamaged matrices and then use the
    same printing methods. \r\n\r\nBut then the result is going to look extremely
    'antique', and not acceptable for most modern uses. \r\n\r\nSo my personal conclusion
    is that historical 'interpretations,' trying to capture what you find best in
    an old typeface, are more worth while to put effort into, rather than striving
    for the probably unreachable goal of 'authenticity'--which may not be the most
    desirable even if you closely approximately it.  "

    this whole revival thing gets \"curioser and curioser\"...  It's relatively easy
    to try to (re)create the past exactly & nostagically - (Frost: \"we lack the courage
    to be ourselves\") - or arrogantly to dismiss it.  \r\n\r\nWhat's supremely difficult
    is to pursue the subtle interpretive path you describe; I'd be willing to bet

    thought of it. \r\n\r\nGerald Lang, 'Bieler,' is a printer using photopolymer
    and sometimes posts here, so perhaps he will come on and tell us. He has said
    in the past that there is ink gain, and he takes this into account in choosing
    typefaces. But I don't know if the gain is the same as with metal. \r\n\r\nA metal
    piece of type has beveled sides leading down from the face to the body of the
    type. My assumption has been that ink gets on these sides, and then is picked
    up by the paper when the metal is pressed into it, and this is a big part of ink
    spread--not simply the ink squeezing out from under the face. (We are talking
    about thousandths of an inch, but still quite noticeable on the page.) I don't
    know if photopolymer has the beveled sides. "

    plates are made from digital files - since the vast majority of digital typefaces
    are optimized for offset rather than letterpress, it seems to me that the effect
    is often more gain.\r\n\r\nAs far as the shape, the way that the plate material
    washes away from the printing surface on a plate does tend to produce a pretty

  body: "William\r\n\r\nI haven't been watching the list that much lately but was
    just now reading through this thread. \r\n\r\nYes, there is ink gain in letterpress,
    whether it is metal or engraving or photopolymer. Justin came up with a uniform
    percentage gain at one point and posted his table of findings on the PPLetterpress
    list. One of the very early entries. He suggested I start the list for the \"investigative
    printer\" and early on, contributed some very significant information. Hrant later
    looked at the data and, as I recall, concurred. Technical reports from the printing
    industry indicate 5% in regard to photopolymer (digital-to-analog).\r\n\r\nSo,
    yes, digital fonts should be reduced by that degree or more when using digital-to-analog.
    Most of the early digital fonts were reproduced from photofilm, not metal patterns,
    and were thus a bit weightier in the first place. And that has not changed.\r\n\r\nJustin
    did indicate to me at one point that he was thinking of producing a letterpress
    version of the Caslon as he thought it looked best printed on handmade paper.
    The letterpress configured digital font Rialto had just appeared on the scene.
    Founders Caslon, as it stands, is not useful for letterpress printing as it carries
    a bit too much residue. While I am fond of faux letterpress digital fonts (for
    some odd reason) they are extremely difficult to work with using the letterpress
    process. This is not to demerit the work, it is one of the most valid historical
    studies we will probably ever bear witness to.\r\n\r\nBasically, the more anemic
    looking the face, the better it is going to work digital-to-analog. The only alternative
    is to alter the weight of fonts in FOG or FL and to hell with the EULA nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe
    relief pattern of photopolymer is not the same as it was in metal type and this
    can be a problem. The closer the surface proximity of imaging the shallower the
    subsurface relief (that is just the way photopolymer works) and often digital
    fonts are outfitted with kerning pairs that cause problems in this regard, which
    can cause \"bridging.\"\r\n\r\nGerald\r\nhttp://BielerPress.blogspot.com"
