body: "dear all,\r\n\r\nare there any templates for contracts for type design commissions?\r\n\r\na
  new client has commisioned me to create a custom type family for them, and asked
  me to submit a contract for their review, since the matter is rather specialized
  and they have no similar documents they could use.\r\n\r\nso, i\u2019ve been wondering:
  are there any standard type design contract forms available covering commissioned
  work, that can be downloaded and customized?\r\ni\u2019m happy to pay a reasonable
  fee if required.\r\n\r\nif available, i\u2019m specifically looking for inclusion
  of wording or clauses regulating:\r\n\u2013 client company has complete usage rights
  in print and digital media as long as company exists in its present form, but no
  rights to resell, while:\r\n\u2013 designer retains all rights to resell typeface
  to other companies or via retail.\r\n\r\nthanks much in advance for any information!\r\njoachim"

    The Graphic Artists Guild Handbook: Pricing & Ethical Guidelines, which includes
    a standard contract for Lettering and Typeface Design. You can order it through
    their website, or find it in any well-stocked bookstore.\r\n\r\nAlso, the website
    has a checklist for writing your own contract, under the resources link.\r\n"
