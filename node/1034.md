  body: we will have to wait and see...  <BR> <BR>once the product is released and
    you upgrade your flash player to 7&#40;the beta is available now&#41; then we
    will start to see stuff. <BR> <BR>i am curious if this is going to hault any further
    development of small pixel/screen fonts, that most recently have been turning
    up all over the place&#40;miniml.com, fontsforflash.com, etc&#41; <BR> <BR>-jm

    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s difficult to say for sure, but it <i>looks</i> like it may actually
    make pixel fonts work better than they do now. We shall see.'

  body: Josh, I don&#39;t think so. The Flash team is very aware of  <BR>current gripes
    with pixel fonts in Flash, so I hope Mark is  <BR>correct. I wish they&#39;d be
    more specific. <BR> <BR>I am happy to see this latest announcement.
