body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI thought for sure someone would have talked about this before...but
  I could not find a thread about it. I like the way mrs eaves numbers look...but
  I don't understand the baseline shift of some of the numbers like the 6 for example.
  As designers are we supposed to be \"fixing\" this or is it just the charm of the
  typeface?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    not trying to be a dick, but if you had to ask, you should really take a typography
    class."

  body: "Hey! \r\n\r\nThere's lots of information on the web about the difference
    between old style and lining figures. Don't feel weird about the question. I took
    a continuing education typography class (at the New School in NY no less!) alongside
    many art directors who had no idea what old style figures were. Typophiles, you
    can collectively throw up now ;o)\r\n\r\nA lot of my education has come from these
    wonderful folks though, so keep on keeping on!"

    same in both lining and oldstyle versions.\r\n"

  body: "I can't argue the point...I have taken one typography class, but my masters
    program really did not emphasis typography. I have learned much more from this
    site about typography than I did in grad school. I learned a lot there...but not
    about type. I guess they assumed that we all learned enough in undergrad, but
    my undergrad was in a different subject so I could really have used the help.
    I learned a lot about art directing photography however which I am very good at
    : )\r\n\r\nNow that I know what they are called I can look up old style figures
    and learn more about them. \r\n\r\nthanks!"
