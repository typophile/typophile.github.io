  body: I think this one is custom made graphic and not a font. It looks like it's
    based on Helvetica Heavy...

  body: Yup, but you'll get that problem with any angle, because A, K, M, N, V, W,
    Y, Z all have different angles.

    make sure that all angles in characters with slanted strokes were either exactly
    the same or noticeably different. ;^)
