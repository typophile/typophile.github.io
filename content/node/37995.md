  <em>corpoetry</em>. Probably the largest type specimen (1.5 m x 6 m) I'll ever be
  allowed to do. It's part of our combined 10 year anniversary party/FontFont's FiFFteen
  exhibition opening.\r\n'Lotta', who we are supposed to show the money for is one
  of our agency's account managers, by the way. \r\n\r\n"
