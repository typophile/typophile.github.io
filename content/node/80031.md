  could identify the \"Schock\" part of the image, I would be so thankful. I've tried
  WhatTheFont but it can only single out the \"S\" and only results with fonts that
  have a similar \"S\" but not the other letters. This is the font used for the logo
  of our boat, and it would be great if I could find this font, or something very
  similar, to use on our crew shits. Thanks so much!"

  body: Looks like its just old school calligraphy rather than a font. I'm guessing
    its been around awhile. This type of thing is difficult to use keywords in searching
    because people tag any handlettering style as calligraphy. This would be more
    precisely broad-edged Italic calligraphy.
