  although i guess i am b/c it is a backwards type ID -- that is, i know the name
  of the font, but i just can't find where to buy it, or even if it is for sale.\r\n\r\nso
  maybe, what i am asking for is similar fonts to this one?\r\n\r\nit seems that script
  fonts are somewhat in style now? so i was looking at some type books and found this
  cool font in the book \"typology\", on page 63, #141, it is called \"lo kursiv\"
  and is by louis oppenheim and the type specimen sheet says \"h. berthold ag\" and
  1912.\r\n\r\ni looked online and found a foreign site that mention it (a type forum
  i think in german?), and that has some images (attached), but i can't seem to find
  a foundry that has digitized it and sells it.\r\n\r\nany ideas? it is a pretty cool
  font.\r\n\r\nthanks guys!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/503a_gruppe_viii__schreibschriften__lokursiv_6663.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/503b_gruppe_viii__schreibschriften__lokursiv_3803.jpg]"

  body: Well, I know of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/lo-type-bq/">one
    foundry</a> who has the italic. I swear Monotype used to offer the italic as well
    though.
