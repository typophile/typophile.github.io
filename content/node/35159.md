body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nHere is a new italic typeface am designing right now.
  Please give your valuable feedback on the design. Am working on the capitals and
  the other characters. I will post them soon for the feedback.\r\n\r\nAlso, please
  don't mind the spacing for now as they all were set individually in the Illustrator.\r\n\r\n\r\nthank
  you so much.\r\nSatya\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/matter4 copy_6338.jpg]\r\n.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/All_4755.jpg]"

  body: "Quite nice.\r\n\r\nThe small horizontal in the q is without reason and will
    probably make most people think it's a sort of G.\r\n\r\nTo see no break in the
    s is a bit surprising."

  body: "Kevin, thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nI tried cutting the \u201Cs\u201D
    but then it was looking so weired to me.\r\nthough i will try something again.
    And ya, that horizontal bar in the \u201Cq\u201D is for nothing, i will remove
    that."

  body: I'd also break the "h", change the "k" because it doesn't really look like
    it's broken, same goes for "m" and change the "z" to a less round one.
