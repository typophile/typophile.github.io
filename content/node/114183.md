  the Yukagir language. It's standard Russian cyrillic, other than the three new glyphs,
  and I don't know how to map the characters (which I built already) so they can easily
  be typed with?\r\n\r\nDo I have to assign them a Unicode? How do I that as well?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot for the help!"

    think you should find those characters here:\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/charts/\r\nand
    assign proper Unicodes if they are defined.\r\n\r\nTo easily type foreign characters
    you usually need a special keyboard layout for the particular language.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"

    such values would presumably go in the Private Use Area; find out what codes your
    input method is generating."

    you will need to right click on the character, select Properties from the menu
    and put the relevant information in the upper and lower boxes. In the case of
    [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/51c/index.htm|Cyrillic Capital

    this requires decompiling and recompiling the Garamond Pro font, an alternative
    \u2013and IMHO more elegant\u2013 route would be to add the glyphs (from an .otf
    generated in FLS) directly in DTL OTMaster. \r\n\r\nThe latest version of OTM
    contains an autohinter for newly added glyphs. The Unicode code points can be
    assigned during import (or later, of course). If necessary, the OT Layout features
    can be exported, altered, and recompiled in OTM.\r\n\r\nFEB"
