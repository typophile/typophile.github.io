body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI just release a new font, called Arnica.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/danieljusti/arnica/\r\n\r\nArnica
  is a display font based on a simple geometry that uses circles (and modules) as
  a structure. It is an experimental project where, in place of upercases, has alternate
  characters and swashes. Furthermore, arnica has 50 discretionary ligatures which,
  when activated, give a totally different touch to the font and also has the bold
  weight, which reinforce the experimentalism of the project.\r\n\r\nI would love
  to hear what you think about it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_4515.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_4988.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03_4179.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/04_4931.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05_5219.jpg]"

    stuff, and legibility. It\u2019s nice when conceptual type is actually legibly."
