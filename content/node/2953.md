  body: Top one looks like some wood type/wild west/carnival  <BR>typeface. Couldn&#39;t
    find anything yet that looks like it. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the complete list of
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=stencil" target="_blank"> stencil
    typefaces</a> on MyFonts,  <BR>but your bottom sample isn&#39;t amongst those.

    target="_blank"> Paralucent Stencil</a> has the same feel to it tho. <BR> <BR>Anyone
    else wanna have a shot at these?

  body: It gotta be digitized since I saw that &#34;All Soul Krew&#34; logo on a cheap
    club flyer from Sweden. I also know that the clothing brand Akademiks is using
    that font on clothes. I hope somebody know the name of the font though...

  body: Ringmaster, on the Solotype Circus Display CD, is very close but not a match.
    <BR> <BR>It has an outline that can be removed fairly <BR>simply in Illustrator.
    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>There is another Solotype book that has 100 Circus fonts. Does
    anyone have this? <BR> <BR>bj <BR>

  body: The only Old Vic it has is No.6, in case that was the one you had in mind.
    The &#39;K&#39;, which was missing from your other sample, does match, by the
    way.

    it&#39;s a free font. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    font book?

  body: It&#39;s only a book. Relatively few of the fonts in the Solotype collection
    were digitized before the company apparently ceased operation a couple of years
    ago. The Solotype collection &#40;or the rights to their files&#41; apparently
    belongs to Castcraft Software these days, but I have heard almost nothing of getting
    replies from them when writing about the Solotype collection. &#40;I was one of
    them -- my mail was ignored.&#41; I once got a listing of the typefaces on the
    Dover Solotype CD&#39;s and the Circus Fonts CD doesn&#39;t have Old Vic on it.

  body: Whether Solotype is out of business or not, MyFonts just announced that they
    are carrying the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/solotype/" target="_blank">Solotype
    Collection</a>. It&#39;s probably the fonts from the Solotype CD-ROMs.

    the near future they&#39;ll be available?

  body: I also just found that out this morning while searching for 1800&#39;s fonts
    &#40;for this query&#41;. There is a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/solo/dan/x/"
    target="_blank">bio statement by Dan Solo</a> that makes it sound as if he is
    going to digitize some more of his fonts now that the Dover work has ended. There
    are 30 fonts in this first batch apparently, and Old Vic is not one of them.

  body: Just on a practicle point, its only three letters. It could be a cleaned up
    scan or traced in Illustrator. For me to believe its a font I need to see a larger
    &#40;more&#41; sample and set as words.

    more than those 3.
