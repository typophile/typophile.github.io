body: "Hello guys,\r\nI\u2019m nearly finishing work on my new experimental 3D typeface
  called Plastica. I\u2019m facing few problems I would  like to discuss.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plastica_Preview_6345.png]\r\n\r\nIt
  is CFF OpenType made in FontLab on PC. Outlines are very precise and I used atypical
  custom UPM of 2300 units (23 modules at 100 units). But this should be fine regarding
  to older nodes on Typophile. \r\nThere are two versions: Plastica One (Striped)
  and Plastica Two (Outlined).\r\nAnd here is what I struggle with:\r\n\r\n<strong>1)
  On-screen rendering issues:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plastica_Rendering_5161.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  font is naturally intended to be used at higher font-sizes. It also works quite
  well when set above cca 70 pt. There is intentionally no hinting at all \u2013 I
  suppose the outlines are way too complex for this - would you agree on this?\r\n\r\nHowever,
  some weird things are happening at lower sizes. Some glyphs become randomly lighter
  or bolder and it all mysteriously changes over different pointsizes. Do you have
  any idea what this could be and how to improve rendering?\r\n(note: all outlines
  are exactly aligned, correct curve direction set, etc.)\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Tracking
  Gaps:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plastica_Tracking_6445.png]\r\n\r\nSo
  far, glyph sidebearings are set exactly to zero, however small unpleasant \u201Cvisual\u201D
  gaps between letters sometimes occur. Would you perhaps suggest to set some small
  overlaps? (ie. negative sidebearings?) If so, how big regarding to 2300 UPM? On
  left, right, or both sides? \r\n(but I\u2019m affraid it could reversely make the
  transitions to look bolder - that happens sometimes too, see the \u201Crendering\"
  image)\r\n\r\n<strong>3) Leading Gaps:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plastica_Leading_3609.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  line leading should be also seamless. So far, it is set up to work perfectly when
  leading=pointsize. However default leading in applications is usually around 120%
  of the given pointsize. It works this way at least in Adobe apps as far as I know.
  Is this the cross-platform/cross-app standard? \r\nErgo, would you suggest to modify
  font metrics so it connects seamlessly at 120% rather then at 100%?\r\n\r\n<strong>4)
  Kerning:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plastica_Kerning_5543.png]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
  it is not possible to make traditional kerning - glyphs would ugly overlap. Instead
  I introduced special alternates to the most extreme letters like AFLTPJVW and some
  other glyphs. There are up to 3 alternates for each of these glyphs (left, central,
  right version). In the end it works quite well. However, it is also pretty tedious
  work to correctly set it up manually by picking different alternates from Glyph
  palette. \r\n\r\nDo you thik this could be possibly automated via some smart OT
  substitution? I was trying with no success - but I\u2019m not much a programmer.
  Do you have any ideas?\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate any help or advice.\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nVit\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> I have also noticed that Illustrator
  (CS6) omits \u201Cspace\u201D glyph when converting font into outlines even if it\u2019s
  not empty. I think this must be an Illustrator\u2019s bug, because it works fine
  in InDesign. As a precaution I put simple \u201Cspace\u201D substitution to solve
  this problem."

  body: "At least some (and possibly all) of these problems are screen-only.\r\n\r\nThe
    random thickening must be due to pixel rounding. Since you don't have hinting,
    the rendering engine is free to do what it likes (including not hinting at all).
    Hinting -- or lack thereof -- and on-screen representation depends on what text
    rendering engine you are using. Windows' is different from OS X's, and some software
    such as Adobe's Creative \"Suite\" have type rendering engines of their own. (I
    quote \"Suite\" because, as you found out, there are unaccounted-for differences
    between the individual programs.)\r\n\r\nIf your primary target is for screen
    only, or you find it important, you need to address your issues, but: some of
    them cannot easily be fixed. The intercharacter white line/overlap problem, for
    example, is because a pixel needs to be drawn .. or not. Without overlap, the
    pixel may disappear due to rounding; with, you get a slightly fatter pixel than
    wanted.\r\n\r\n... Both the idea and its execution are pretty awesome, by the
    way."

  body: "Thank you, Theunis,\r\nI agree the rendering issues are probably screen-only
    problem. I'm quite sure the outlines itself are OK.\r\nAnd I know the rasterizing
    is really tricky in this very case, it will never be perfect at smaler sizes.
    \r\nHowever I think at least all the glyphs should look consistent at certain
    pointsize - what should be the possible reason why some render bolder or lighter?
    (all the horizontal stripes/outlines are perfectly aligned and of exactly same
    width, ergo any eventual pixel rounding should be the same too?)\r\n\r\nI have
    tested it on PC only so far and it looks very similar over many different apps
    (Adobe and others)\r\n\r\nRegarding vertical gaps: I'm starting to believe that
    some small glyph overlap could make it better, I just wander what realtive value
    would be best.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nVit"

  body: "Cool project! \r\nI can't help with the rasterization issues, but can assure
    you that changing out better fitting versions of letters can certainly be done
    with OpenType. What you want to look for are \"contextual alternates.\"\r\nhttp://opentypecookbook.com/
    is a good introduction geared to those new to it.\r\nhttps://www.glyphsapp.com/tutorials/features-part-2-contextual-substitutions
    also might be useful (even if you're not using Glyphs). \r\nFor the leading, I
    would think you would want to leave it alone and trust the end-user to set the
    text solid if that's the desired effect. "

  body: "To prevent those gaps, I'm pretty sure all you should need is one unit of
    overlap on each side.\r\n\r\nYou can do your kerning thing with calt but you will
    probably have to do it without the little diagonal spacing glyphs. Opentype does
    one-to-one substitution or many-to-one; it won't insert more glyphs."

    go for that.\r\n\r\n@cerulean OpenType also has one-to-many substitutions, but
    no direct support for many-to-many.\r\n"
