  some new ideas on a project I'm working on. \r\n\r\nI've been asked to create an
  icon to accompany a logo still in progress. I want the icon to be simple and to
  suggest being \"in IT.\" \r\n\r\nIdeally, the icon would read, simply, \"IT,\" but
  upon 2nd read you notice that in the negative space, you can see the word \"in.\"
  That's the ideal I guess. But ultimately I just want the word \"IN\" to \"play\"
  with the word \"IT.\" The Sun Microchip icon that looks like a chip but upon 2nd
  read, you see that it spells \"sun\" is another way this could work. \r\n\r\n\"IT\"
  should be u/c and the overall look should be \"techy.\" But no other restrictions.
  It's been a real challenge to get this to work. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick, nice work. Thanks! \r\n\r\nI think the first one has some real potential.
    I'd actually never tried a front/back treatment. It almost looks as if the IN
    has a dimensional relationship with the IT. I might try to push that further. "
