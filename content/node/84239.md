body: I am having trouble with a press-ready pdf that was supplied from an ad agency
  to be printed in our newspaper, some of the Ts have dropped off once the pdf has
  gone through our RIP. Document was created using Quarkxpress and distilled to create
  PDF - font (Trajan) has been embedded. I remember having the same problem years
  ago before CS was even thought of and Xpress was the norm, we always had trouble
  with True Type and MT faces (we would sometimes convert text to outlines in Freehand
  and import as a picture - way before you could convert text to outlines in Xpress)
  ... How things have changed ... We have since converted the fonts in the PDF to
  paths and re-downloaded through our RIP with no issues, we still need to know why
  it happened in the first place, if anyone can shed any light it would be much appreciated.
  Thanks.
