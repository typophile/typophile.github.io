body: Two years ago I created a logo for a company called Trent&#39;s Prints. The
  company sells artwork by Trent Altman who also has autism.  <BR> <BR>The company
  wants to build a website and make brochures, catelogs, etc. Until now the logo has
  been on business cards only and before alot of money is put into things I want to
  make the logo better. <BR> <BR>The font used is Rundfunk. Adobe Garamond is used
  as the secondary type. My customer liked Rundfunk because it has an &#34;artsy&#34;
  feel. The icon is a &#34;T&#34; brushed to give a feel for what the company sells.
  Pms 262 is the color used for the purple and pms 241 is used for the pink.  <BR>

  <BR>&#40;The purple appears duller than it really is&#41;

  body: The brush stroke looks like an airplane to me. <BR> <BR>I like that Rundfunk
    font, though I think it calls for a more radical companion than Adobe Garamond.  I&#39;m
    thinking that Vendetta Italic might look better. <BR> <BR>Also, don&#39;t forget
    your curly quotes on the slogan.

  body: '- Yes, that&#39;s an airplane. Or maybe a really stiff bird &#40;that just
    pooped&#41;. <BR>- The Adobe Garamond is too soft. Vendetta is a great suggestion.
    <BR>- I&#39;d bring the apostrophe down to inside the &#34;T&#34;. <BR>- I would
    make the rule much shorter. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    &#40;except I don&#39;t get the dead guy association&#41;. Is it hurting the logo?
    I am curious to know.  <BR> <BR>Hrant and Chris, I worked on your suggestions.
    I see what you mean by the type treatment. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25496.gif"

  body: I do like the apostrophe above the line of lettering. I have decreased the
    point size and added kerning. I also altered the icon so it doesn&#39;t look like
    a bird or airplane...or a dead guy. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25591.gif"

  body: Tom, I&#39;ve been thinking about this, and reading what the others have been
    saying. It seems to me, that while the illustrative part of this is playful and
    organic the type is toooo rigid, and I&#39;m not referring to the Vendetta, not
    necessarily. The rundfunk seems to call so much attention to itself &#40;to me&#41;
    that the illust. loses it&#39;s impact.  <BR> <BR> <BR>What about typefaces with
    similar bone structure, but without being &#34;fussy&#34;? Nick Shinn&#39;s <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/eunoia/regular/testdrive.html?s=TRENT%27S%2BPRINT%27S&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Eunoia Regular</a>? It has the same contrast as Rundfunk. You
    might even think about something without so much contrast.  <BR> <BR>Just ideas.
    <BR> <BR>More spacing in the Vendetta was a good call.  <BR> <BR>Do you &#34;need&#34;
    the rule at all? It also seems to drive away from the illustration more than it
    helps. <BR> <BR>One more thing. What if you stacked the slogan and made it a little
    bigger opting for the lighter weight?  <BR> <BR>Breaking through Autism <BR>with
    Artistic Expression. <BR> <BR>I think it makes too much of a statement not to
    be punctuated too.

    think it is better without it. Also below is what Eunoia Condensed would look
    like. I would rather not stack the slogan because I don&#39;t want too much importance
    on the slogan. I do like the period at the end. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25913.gif"

  body: Tom, I think Eunoia is better. Do you think the name is too big? Do you think
    if you scaled it down, oh about 85% it would be in better relation to the slogan?
    Do you think the whitespace around the illust is uneven, could the type be moved
    down? Is there not enough space in between the company name and the slogan in
    relation to how much space you have in between the letters of the company name?
    <BR> <BR>Just thoughts.

  body: 'I disagree with you Chris. I recommended something less decorative because
    the logo &#40;illustration&#41; seems to me to be the most important part of this.
    The &#34;artistic expression&#34; is in the illus ... the type was too dominant
    and not allowing a more natural hierarchy. Not everything in any given compostion
    can do the shouting. '

  body: I stuck with Rundfunk because my client loves it. I see what you are saying
    about the business Tiffany, but I think I look at Rundfunk as playful more than
    you. Runkfunk does call attention to itself, but I feel that by adding tracking
    I decreased the activity.  <BR> <BR>The bookmarks were taken to the printer today.
    I didn&#39;t have alot of time to play unfortunitely. My clients are happy with
    the end result.
