body: I am working on putting together new packaging for a management consulting corporation.
  It must appeal to a younger client base (18-25) while not alienating the existing
  client base (45-60 age bracket).  The key words for the brand are ACTION, SUCCESS
  and WINNING. The current font used is Eras, which is not fresh although does have
  a sense of action. I would like to get any suggestions on a serif and sans-serif
  pair based on the above criteria. Any opinions are appreciated.

    font that has a full body--light, regular, bold, etc. One I was looking at is
    Pill Gothic. Another was Politica. '
