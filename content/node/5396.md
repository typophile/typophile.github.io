body: Hi. I&#39;m no font expert, but I have been trying to design an uppercase Q
  for a font that has no uppercase included, and would appreciate some criticism.
  The gifs below show my first three versions, any constructive criticism most welcome..
  I think I&#39;m getting close with the last version, but the inner elipse is distorted.
  Thanks. Tom <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39498.gif"

  body: 'Tail is too heavy and flattens out too much on the thick &#40;right&#41;
    side. Concept is very interesting. <BR>Since you are having problems with it,
    I  would suggest you think of common words one may use an upper case Q for. In
    english most words starting with a &#34;Q&#34; follow with a &#34;u&#34;-example
    :Question, Queen, Quagmire, etc..and think of how this glyph would look in that
    context. '

  body: thanks! How about these? <BR> <BR>Just discovered this forum, and it has inspired
    me to find out more.. Was wondering if anyone could recommend a good introductory
    book on typography? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39795.png"

  body: Hi tom! <BR> <BR>this is much better &#40;especially the bottom one&#41;,
    but you could make it even simpler. I send you my suggestion. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    know any book to introduce you typography, but one of the must-have books about
    Typography is Robert Bringhurst&#39;s &#34;The Elements of Typographic Style&#34;.
