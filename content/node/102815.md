  body: "I was pointed to this redesign thru a Tweet from J\xFCrgen Siebert and my
    reaction was: bad design, too mechanical, too thought\u2013thru. Mr Siebert disagreed
    at first, but then changed his opinion (after some explanation from me).\r\n\r\nIn
    the discussion on the site there is a Mr Marchington who has put my opinion perfectly
    into words:\r\n<blockquote>I really have to disagree with the consensus here.
    The new design loses all of the character of the original. it is so sanitized
    and dull. The designers could have done so much with the character and playfulness
    of the original. The uniformity of the x-height in the new version is boring,
    beige and bloody ugly. Ugh! Couldn't be more white bread if they tried. They should
    be ashamed of themselves given the opportunity.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt IS always
    noticeable when something has been designed by committee\u2026 (And on a side
    note: A lot of artwork is too slick because designers don\u2019t draw or sketch
    but start out with digital tools.)"

    towards italic...

  body: "Instagram seems to have led to a kind of homogenization of amateur digital
    imagery on the web. It seems appropriate that its logo be likewise homogenized.\r\n"
