body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone can help me.  We currently have a database
  called 4d (4th Dimension) \r\nunfortunately every time we upgrade from one version
  of os x to another 10.3 to 10.4 or upgrade\r\noffice  2003-2004 or 2008 we have
  font issues with the reports 4D produces. 4D seems to substitute\r\ndifferent fonts
  of Arial. We believe the issue is with office or mac os x changing the font between
  versions.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an suggestions as to how we can fix this issue
  without buying expensive font management \r\nsoftware for 200+ macs\r\n\r\nWe have
  already moved from helvetica to Arial in an effort to fix issues we had with cross
  mac/pc platform and id hate to have to redesign all our data base reports every
  time we upgrade office or Mac os X. "
