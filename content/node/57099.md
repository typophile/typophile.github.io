body: "\r\nhi all,\r\n\r\nI've been having this issue with inDesign lately. I am setting
  a\r\nparagraph left-justified, ragged right. Hyphenation is turned off, \r\nand
  snapping to a baseline grid is turned on.\r\n\r\nInDesign will send words to the
  next line which I am quite certain\r\nwill fit within the column measure. And there
  is no manual carriage\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions to address
  this?\r\n\r\nthanks much,\r\njarrod\r\n"

    calculates to be the lesser evil.

    \"Balance ragged lines,\" which might come in handy now and then."
