  body: Got it. Thanks. I think you would want to add the Aldine Press as well. I
    see Manutius and Griffo under Typographers but nothing about the Aldine Press
    under Events or Places. To paraphrase Ron Burgundy, it's kind of a big deal.

    be included in the next update (plus many more points, font samples for type designers
    and a few other features to make it more user friendly). It will be ready at the
    end of the month. We promised it earlier but it is taking a little bit more time
    than expected. We will also launch the Android version in the same time. Follow
    us on twitter or facebook for news and updates. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately we've run
    out of promo codes. We are browsing old emails, maybe we will find some unused,
    but we cannot guarantee that they are still valid.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other
    suggestion let us know (here on the forum or using twitter, facebook, email)\r\n\r\nThanks
    again\r\n\r\n "
