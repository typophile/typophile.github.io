  body: "Stymie (the Bitstream version) has a similar \"R\", but differs in other
    details\r\n(like the head serif on the \"G\", serif on the crossbar of the \"E\",
    and noticeable trapping in the \"M\"). \r\nMy money's on <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/memphis/\">Memphis
    Medium</a>."
