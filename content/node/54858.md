body: "I have developed an Opentype family for a client. I generated them all and
  produced a test document using InDesign CS3 and exported the document as a pdf to
  Acrobat 8. So far so good.\r\n\r\nThe client sent an email last week which stated
  that they had done the same thing in InDesign CS4 and exported the document as a
  pdf to Acrobat 9. Both documents were fine. They then sent the pdf to their printer
  who tried to open the pdf in Acrobat 7. Using Acrobat 7 the OpenType font appears
  as 'notdef' symbol apart from a couple of characters.\r\n\r\nThe so-called technical
  expert at the printers is insisting that the font is corrupt and unusable, whereas
  I think it is an Acrobat issue.  He knows that he can just download the latest version
  of Acrobat 9 for free, but for some reason insists on using Acrobat 7, making out
  that downloading and installing the latest version would be a major inconvenience,
  while insinuating my incompetence.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is that an earlier Postscript
  typeface (in blue) displays with no problem in both versions of Acrobat. Have I
  done something wrong when generating the OTF?\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this incompatibility
  problem with InDesign CS4, OpenType fonts and versions below Acrobat 8?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any replies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Acrobad_5423.gif]"

  body: I think the issue is from trying to open up a newer PDF-version file with
    an old version of Acrobat. Try a test - save your PDF's down to Acrobat 5 level
    and see if the printer can open that successfully. If so, that proves that it's
    Acrobat 7 at fault and not the font.

    no Acrobat present, convert to outlines, save as eps, drag to Apple Preview, it
    distills the file and give you a good pdf. Done."

  body: "If only it were that simple Andr\xE9. I know that would be a perfectly workable
    solution but the client has paid for custom typefaces - they want to use the typefaces,
    not turn them to outlines. \r\n\r\nAfter the technical expert at the printers
    so unhelpfully stuck the boot in, the client now believes there is something wrong
    with the fonts. \r\n\r\nI need to know if this is a compatibility issue with CS4
    programs and pdf's viewed on Acrobat 7 or lower.\r\n\r\nBen - I don't have CS4,
    I'm still on CS3 so I can't replicate the problem, but thanks anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "What version of Acrobat did you select by 'Compatibility' in the PDF export
    options? \r\n\r\nSet it to Acrobat 5.0 (PDF 1.4). Or choose PDF/X-1a:2001 under
    'Standard', which sets it even to Acrobat 4 (PDF 1.3). I don't think it has anything
    to do with CS4, but with compatibility settings.\r\n\r\nHe should be able to open
    the PDF in his old Acrobat 7.0 then."

    font in question is broken/invalid inside the PDF (don\u2019t know about the original,
    but whatever embedded and/or modified the embedding killed it).\r\n\r\nA Type
    1 font\u2019s built-in encoding shall be defined by an Encoding array that is
    part of the font program, not to be confused with the Encoding entry in the PDF
    font dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe encoding array in the problematic font has only ONE
    ENTRY (the \u2018A\u2019, which is why it displays correctly).\r\n\r\nWe have
    code now in CT/PDFL/Acrobat that detects this bogus case and falls back to using
    the Encoding from the PDF font dictionary instead of the embedded Encoding...\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    have no idea what this means, But I presume it relates to CS4. I do know the font
    does not have a standard Adobe character list, and when I generated the font window
    name was set to 'MacOS Roman' - maybe it should be set to 'Imported'?\r\n\r\nWhere
    is the info for the encoding array in the font which shows only ONE ENTRY?\r\n\r\nNick

    In FontLab this can be achieved through the Preferences. But you're generating
    an OpenType font from FontLab, so I'm not sure how this option affects that.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StandardEncoding_3860.png]\r\n\r\nNick,
    I have CS4. If you send me one of the fonts I'll test it along with some of our
    fonts."

  body: "Yes.\r\n\r\nI believe that even in FontLab, this determines the encoding
    used inside the CFF table, which is independent of the encoding used in the cmap
    table. My recollection is that using stuff other than StandardEncoding for the
    CFF table can cause problems....\r\n\r\n(Miguel, if you want more info on this,
    I think Sairus may have been involved in investigating the issue. David might
    also remember.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Nick,\r\nI know this is an old question, but I've just encountered a similar
    problem by another means. I'm a Ventura user and have found difficulty with the
    interface between Ventura and Acrobat, mostly related (I believe) to the amount
    of RAM available. In replacing an old desktop with a new machine with 8 MB of
    RAM, running Ventura 10 and Acrobat X, I discovered when I tried to use Adobe's
    Caslon Pro in its .otf format, Ventura would display the typeface with no trouble,
    would print to an HP 1320 with no problem, but Acrobat would generate blank pages
    whereever I had the .otf font. Acrobat printed rules (e.g., crop marks) fine and
    rendered heads and subheads that used a .ttf font, but NO GO on the .otf. When
    I uninstalled the Caslon Pro set of fonts, converted the 4 weights to .ttf, and
    reinstalled, I was able to generate a pdf (though a request for a pdf of the entire
    publication elicited an error message in Acrobat). Using CorelDraw X3 for comparison,
    I found when I changed the text to the .otf font, the text disappeared in Draw.
    So the problem must be a matter of interface between .otf and some applications
    (notably both Acrobat and Draw)."
