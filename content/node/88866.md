body: "Is there an easy way to set up column guides on each side of a spread in InDesign?\r\n\r\nSay
  I'm working on an 11 x 17 brochure (which will be folded in half). I've got a .5\"
  margin, but I'd like the gutter to be 1\", and each side to have 6 columns for my
  grid. My usual cumbersome method would be to draw a text box with six columns the
  width of one side of the spread, and then manually put guides at the same spot as
  the the columns in the text box?\r\n\r\nI feel stupid for asking this (having been
  working in Indesign for so long), but is there an easier way?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: You can apply different settings to each side of a spread by using master
    pages - though I'm not clear on why you would need to do that in this instance.

  body: "If you are working with a 11x17\" paper, your procedure is already the best
    I know.\r\n\r\nBut things could be easier if you work with a spread of two 11x8,5\"
    pages:\r\n\r\n<strong>01</strong>. Create the document using \"facing pages\"
    option enabled.\r\n\r\n<strong>02</strong>. Set inside margins to achieve the
    central gap (in your case, they are actually the same 0.5\" in order to get the
    final 1\" gutter).\r\n\r\n<strong>03</strong>. In master page, use the command
    Layout > Create guides to set up your 6-column layout. Note the option to define
    guides inside margins only.\r\n\r\nThese two optional controls could also help
    your work:\r\n\r\n<strong>04</strong>. If you want to edit the spread with both
    pages visible, disable \"Allow document pages...\" option in pages panel menu
    and drag page 2 to be together with page 1.\r\n\r\n<strong>05</strong>. Use the
    File > Print booklet to finnish the work or make imposition in Acrobat with the
    excellent Quite Imposing plug-in."

  body: You only need to create the guides on one side, then select all the guides
    (command-option-G), duplicate them (edit > duplicate) and drag the duplicates
    as a group to the other side.  Not a huge timesaver, but it's a little faster.

    can find them in the usual places (eg Adobe Studio etc,)
