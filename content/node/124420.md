  body: "Reminds me of Lectura, a design by Dick Dooijes, Amsterdam Foundry, circa
    1966. Letraset sold a version as a contact transfer from Tetterode. Character
    set is in the old Letraset product catalog. \r\nA much thicker and more conventional
    version by Paul Hickson is available in digital format as Leighton from Red Rooster

  body: "The resemblance to Lectura is only approximate. Here is a character set \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lectura1966_5756.png]\r\nCompare
    to this better quality image of the book cover, which was published in the early
    1970s [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BarthesSM_4426.jpg]\r\nStill have not
    spotted a digital font. Perhaps a photolettering font, or lettering?\r\nDon"

    in \u201Cthe\u201D have quite different ascenders. "
