body: Hi, this is my first pixel type, but it was not my first idea. The original
  idea was a simple display font, composed by geomeric modules, the regularity on
  some gliphs proves that it can be work on pixels, generating gray smoth pixels too
  at 8 points. Now i am interesed to finish this font, thanks for your critiques.

    so smooth and so legible.

    work&#40;and look&#41;well on print and on photoshop too right? That can be cool

    font on Flash? <BR> <BR>

  body: Nice illustration of a fact - subpixels do not need to be square.  <BR> <BR>Luciano&#39;s
    way is a twist on the method TiD patented and licensed to FFF. We used square
    subpixels but many geometric forms are possible. Different fonts may call for
    different subforms. <BR> <BR>TiD is launching a foundry to popularize and market
    such fonts to Flash and Photoshop designers, contact me for info. <BR> <BR>Adding
    to Darryl and Gustavo&#39;s comments, many diagonals &#40;N,M,K etc&#41; are fuzzy.
    Tune them in Photoshop, then get a calculator and figure out the grey fill.

  body: 'I&#39;ve experimented with curves as you have, but without the results you
    have achieved. Nice work. <BR> <BR>My experimenting has been done with bold pixel
    fonts though, where the contrast between the black and the gray portions of each
    letterform are much more pronounced. <BR> <BR>I really think that &#34;gray&#34;
    pixel fonts are great additions to the pixel font world, but what are your thoughts
    on their useability? <BR> <BR>What I mean to say is, the letterforms break down
    when not used at their intended point size. Before anyone yells foul, I&#39;m
    not talking about setting the type at 10pt when the font should be set at 8. I&#39;m
    talking about setting the type at 16pt or 24. <BR> <BR>Granted, not many pixel
    font owners actually set the type this way, but it is one definate advantage that
    non aliased pixel fonts have over their &#34;gray&#34; cousins: wider useage possibilities.
    <BR> <BR>Each has its own strengths, I think, and am glad to see more energy going
    into pixel font development.'

  body: 'There&#39;s huge development in pixelfonts, at the garage level, and it is
    awesome. Big digital type companies so far have seemed to ignore it, which is
    dumb cause cheap devices are sprouting screens all the time. <BR> <BR>Luciano
    asked: <BR>&#62; Hello Christopher, How is the TiD patented <BR>&#62; method?
    Can you explain here to compare? Thanks <BR> <BR>A year ago, there were no greyscale
    pixelfonts. I had a brainstorm, did some tests, and came up with a reliable method.
    TiD applied for and got a provisional patent on the use of subpixel forms &#34;partial
    fills&#34; in outline type. Outline type is the key - there are embedded bitmap
    fonts on Win, Mac and Unix but they are not compatible. <BR> <BR>Partly this was
    to make me rich, partly it was to prevent other companies from patenting it for
    one platform or the other. Currently outline pixelfonts &#40;grayscale and otherwise&#41;
    are the ONLY crossplatform compatible pixel fonts. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a little
    ironic that the outline format, in a way the opposite of pixels, is the bridge.
    <BR> <BR>tyler asked: <BR>&#62; I really think that &#34;gray&#34; pixel fonts
    are <BR>&#62; great additions to the pixel font world,  <BR>&#62; but what are
    your thoughts on their useability?  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a compromise. They can be
    MORE usable at their intended size, cause grey helps humans read, especially when
    the pixels are painted by another human. But they do fall apart at other sizes.
    I think we&#39;ll need every kind of type in the future.'

  body: Pretty nice overall. <BR>1&#41; The taller smallcaps are better. <BR>2&#41;
    Upright italics don&#39;t really work &#40;as emphasis&#41; - it&#39;s better
    to call that a &#34;cursive Roman&#34;. <BR>3&#41; I think the oldstyle numerals
    a little bit too oldstyle. Try making them hybrids, matching the [larger] smallcaps
