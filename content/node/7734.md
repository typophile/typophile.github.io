  body: I think the sans is just widened Helvetica.

  body: That&#39;s basically the same, but I agree we should link to the  <BR>original
    designs wherever possible. As for Inflex, I don&#39;t  <BR>believe that&#39;s
    it, as squishing it would make the face less  <BR>heavy, not heavier like in the
    poster. Let&#39;s not call off the  <BR>dogs just yet.

    target="_blank">ITC Modern 216 Heavy</a>. Inflex is similar, but I think this
    is a better match.'

  body: I think indeed it is. Serif shapes match perfectly, as does the weight. <BR>Excellent
    job as always, Mark.

  body: You got me, Mark.  It does look alot more like Modern... it was late, I was
    trying to quickly whip up some ID&#39;s and got sloppy.  Sorry guys!

  body: The Benguiat polish is unmistakable. You know, how the curves look almost
    too perfect. That&#39;s what made me think of Modern 216. Not very obvious, though,
    because the particular characters used don&#39;t give much away.

  body: I meant that Swiss 921 Light Extended is in fact the Bitstream  <BR>&#34;version&#34;
    of Neue Helvetica 43 Light Extended. Go to <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14101.html?1060495139"

    for further explanations.

  body: I seem to always pick the knockoffs thinking they&#39;re originals... remember
    when I took Book Antiqua over Palatino a few weeks ago?

  body: It&#39;s not always so easy to know which is the original unless you have
    the institutional knowledge. I date from the pre-digital Linotype era so I instinctively
    go for the names I recognize from the old days, like Helvetica, Bodoni and Futura.
