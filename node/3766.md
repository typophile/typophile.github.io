body: I&#39;ve asked this already on FL list, but now think that this might be a more
  better platform fot my question. <BR> <BR>I have a question concerning Catalan middot
  in PC TTF. I generated fonts in FL with a standard Latin 1, <BR>1252 encoding, and
  the middot &#40;aka periodcentered&#41; had 00B7 unicode value, yet it seems that
  it doesn&#39;t function properly on a PC. Now I am looking around and see that other
  values e.g., 22C5, 2219 are also used. Does anyone know where are these values coming
  from? Is it necessary to encode the middot to all three of them? <BR> <BR>Is there
  a know issue about using middot in various PC applications? Does anyone have experience
  with this? <BR> <BR>Thank you, Peter

  body: Correct. The Catalan keyboard cannot access it, and when trying to type it
    get only missing glyph symbol.

  body: I believe the correct codepoint for the Catalan middot is U&#43;2219. I usually
    double-encode the /periodcentered/ glyph as U&#43;00B7 and U&#43;2219.

  body: 'Peter,  <BR> <BR>1. Instead of using arbitrary names for your glyphs &#40;&#34;middot&#34;&#41;,
    I suggest that you use standardized names listed in the Adobe Glyph List For New
    Fonts 1.1 &#40;in your case, &#34;periodcentered&#34;&#41;.  <BR> <BR>You will
    find all the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts 1.1 at <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/aglfn13.txt"
    target="_blank">http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/aglfn13.txt</a>  <BR>
    <BR>2. For glyph names that are not in the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts, check
    whether the glyph is a basic &#40;default&#41; form of a character encoded in
    the Unicode Standard. If so, use the Unicode-based glyph name:  <BR>a&#41; for
    BMP Unicode codepoints, use the name &#34;uniXXXX&#34; where XXXX are the 4 hexadecimal
    digits representing the codepoint.  <BR>b&#41; for non-BMP Unicode codepoints,
    use the name &#34;uXXXXX&#34; where XXXXX are the 5 hexadecimal digits representing
    the codepoint.  <BR> <BR>3. If a glyph is an alternate form of a character that
    is encoded in the Unicode Standard or is listed in the Adobe Glyph List For New
    Fonts 1.1, use the glyph name of the basic form followed by a period, followed
    by a suffix. For the suffix, use the name of the OpenType Layout feature that
    you would most likely access that glyph through.  <BR> <BR>For example, for a
    small-caps A, use &#34;A.smcp&#34;, for a styllistic alternate R use &#34;R.salt&#34;,
    for a swash Q use &#34;Q.swsh&#34;, for a superior m use &#34;m.sups&#34;, for
    a tabular 5 use &#34;five.tnum&#34; etc. If there are multiple OpenType Layout
    features that can be used to access a glyph, pick one of your liking.  <BR> <BR>4.
    If a glyph is a ligature that is not found in the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts,
    use the glyph names of the glyphs that form the ligature, concatenated using underscore.
    For example, for a ct ligature, use &#34;c_t&#34;, for an ffi ligature use &#34;f_f_i&#34;,
    for a ligature of long s and i use &#34;longs_i&#34;.  <BR> <BR>5. If a glyph
    is an ornament, a non-textual symbol etc., use a glyph name of your liking.  <BR>
    <BR>6. Assign proper Unicode indexes to the glyphs discussed in &#40;1&#41; and
    &#40;2&#41;. If the same glyph represents more than one Unicode character:  <BR>a&#41;
    create multiple glyphs with identical content but different names, and assign
    one Unicode codepoint per glyph; for example, create a &#34;periodcentered&#34;
    glyph and encode it as U&#43;00B7, and create a &#34;uni2219&#34; glyph and encode
    it as U&#43;2219.  <BR>b&#41; alternatively, either assign multiple Unicode codepoints
    to your glyph; for example, for &#34;periodcentered&#34;, assign U&#43;00B7 and
    U&#43;2219.  <BR> <BR>7. For glyphs discussed in &#40;3&#41;, &#40;4&#41;, &#40;5&#41;,
    you may but don&#39;t have to assign custom codepoints from the Unicode Private
    Use Area &#40;PUA&#41;: from U&#43;E000 to U&#43;F8FF. I recommend against assigning
    these codepoints, but for some applications &#40;e.g. Microsoft Word 2003 for
    Windows&#41;, assigning PUA codepoints may be the only way to display such glyphs
    in your font.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.  <BR>'

  body: Nice post from Adam. Just a couple of comments. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Although it&#39;s
    good to use consistent suffixes, people should be aware that from a technical
    perspective the suffix is irrelevant. <BR> <BR>5&#41; Some symbols have Unicode
    codepoints, and if so one should use the appropriate uniXXXX/uXXXXX name. Otherwise,
    as Adam says, one can name them whatever one likes &#40;as long as it doesn&#39;t
    conflict with names that have defined meanings&#41;. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    not sure that the Latin 1 encoding claims support for Catalan. I&#39;ve looked
    into this some more, and I think I may be mistaken in my identification of 2219
    as the correct codepoint for the Catalan dot. I thought this was noted on the
    MST website somewhere, but I cannot find the reference now and instead note this,
    from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/diacritics.htm">Diacritics
    Design Standards</a>: <BR><i> <BR><b>L or l Catalan &#40;L with mid dot&#41; </b>
    <BR>This character is actually a compound character made from a base character
    and an additional punctuation character. The mid dot is used in the Catalan language
    to separte two lowercase l or two uppercase L characters that are not part of
    the same syllable in a word.  <BR> <BR>The mid dot is commonly made from the overdot
    diacritic U&#43;02D9 or a character made specifically for this purpose. Often
    the period U&#43;002E, period centered U&#43;2219 or mid dot U&#43;00B7 are not
    an appropriate size for this character. The dot in the L or l Catalan character
    should be positioned to center vertically on the uppercase height and center horizontally
    when followed by another L or l. </i> <BR> <BR>This seems to me very unsatisfactory,
    because although the U&#43;02D9 <i>glyph,</i> is an appropriate size for the Catalan
    dot, it is not necessarily the appropriate character code to use. <BR> <BR>Peter,
    try this: In WordPad on Windows, enter the Catalan dot from your Catalan keyboard
    -- resulting in a .notdef glyph I presume -- and then enter alt&#43;X this will
    convert the preceding character to a hexadecimal character code, so you can confirm
    exactly what Unicode value is input from the Catalan keyboard.'

  body: I just checked the Unicode standard, which includes a precomposed L=middot
    for Catalan &#40;based on some old 7- or 8-bit Spanish standard&#41;, and the
    compatability decomposition for this indicates that the dot is, in fact, U&#43;00B7.
    So please ignore my previous advice re. U&#43;2219. <BR> <BR>What Catalan keyboard
    driver are you using? My Windows XP does not ship with a Catalan keyboard.

  body: Adam, John thanks for your answers. I figured how it could be solved, but
    I was wondering why there would be different codepoints for the same glyph, and
    whether it is the same glyph or it is also used in different languages or situations.
    Some foundries, for example, add U&#43;2219 as a supplement for the space character
    when &#39;show invisibles&#39; is turned on in some applications. <BR> <BR>I cannot
    answer in detail right now what didn&#39;t work about 00B7, because I can&#39;t
    test it myself, and rely on my Catalan contact. I will check and get back.

  body: There are tons of cases in Unicode where you have what could be the same glyph
    at different codepoints. Some of these are purely for historical encoding reasons
    &#40;capital letter A with ring above versus Angstrom symbol&#41;. Some of them
    have linguistic differences &#40;English, Greek and Cyrillic have different characters,
    but in each case one of those language-specific characters might look an awful
    lot like an &#34;A&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: I just found this.. <BR> <BR>The referrence to the catalan in the MS document  referring
    to x02C9 &#40;overdot&#41; is saying that the catalan dot should be a punctutation
    character similar to the way the over dot x02C9 was designed and NOT a MATHEMATICAL
    operator which is what both X00B7 and x2219 are.  <BR> <BR>x2219 is in &#39;Mathematical
    Operators&#39; in unicode and xB7 is part of the ASCII set that comes from earliest
    technical keyboards and all the character in there are Math characters not pubishing
    characters, ie. ASCII Tilde &#40;used in programming&#41;, ASCII circumflex &#40;used
    in Pascal for pointers&#41;, middot &#40;used as a mathematical operator for muliplication&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>I did a test back then and just did now and xB7 is mapped in the catalan keyboard.  <BR>
    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/43049.gif" alt="catalan
    shift three"> <BR> <BR>I believed technically x2027 &#39;Hyphenation point&#39;
    in the x2000..x206F &#39;General Punctuation&#39; section of Unicode is more correct
    as the Catalan dot than either the historical middot or math operator periodcentered...
    <BR> <BR>But they pull x00B7.  <BR> <BR>Back in the Ikarus days for lazer imagesetters
    we use to make a Capital Catalan dot and a small Catalan dot that were on different
    widths and spaced differently so when they were composed with the Capital L or
    small l they would center correctly. The Capital L dot would need to have a negative
    left sidebearing for it to center between L&#39;s.  <BR> <BR> <BR>

    and in that section of unicode and is probably wrong.  <BR> <BR>Back then I was
