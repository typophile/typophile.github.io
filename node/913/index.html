  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Formerly Alphabetty now MonkeyBoys Top-font-Gear place.  <BR> <BR>Hey Dave that pic looked like me driving south from Florence.. on the Autostrada..lights on or no lights?? found out YES.. on motorways and non-city roads new law&hellip; and John boy did I miss the Audi S3 and the 1.8T 215BHP&hellip; I had a Renault Clio..1.2 which had lots of trouble getting up the Tuscan hills &hellip; I found a hint.. turn off the air conditioning. and a bit confused about how to get it into reverse. but all sorted HAD TO HAVE MY GIRLFRIEND SHOW ME!!! there you go Tiff&hellip; there is your mention for Alphabetty. Woman are good about the details.. she's a lousy driver&hellip;. believe me. Only odd thing that happened was a friend who is a new driver and comedy writer hit my back bumper at the Tuscan villa on the Clio and the plastic thing in the bumper fell out and the bumper almost fell off. I had to fix it a bit so it looked like it wasn't hit. I couldn't tell if he did all the damage or some of it was from the no parking sign I knocked over in Florence near the hotel doing a U-turn in the street.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; turn off the air conditioning <BR> <BR>Yeah, in smaller cars it feels like you're doubling the horse power! Last summer in Halkidiki* I was trying to find this little monastery on a hill in the middle of nowhere, dirt trails and all, in a little Hyundai. The first day we were four adults and a kid, and we couldn't find it, but we did get over a pretty steep uphill with some proper clutch work. The next day we tried again with three adults and a kid (my dad refused to come along that time), but when we got to the strong uphill part the car refused to go. Thinking &quot;this can't be right&quot;, I tried a hunch and turned off the AC, and there it went! It turned out we had the AC off the previous time. There really is something pretty sick about AC, if you ask me - at least in a car. <BR> <BR>* After the Thessaloniki conference, which is happening again next year, and I recommend both the conference and the tourism there very highly. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, men and women are good at different things. There's nothing wrong with accepting that, as long as you don't use it unfairly. Generally, it's good to know the truth. <BR> <BR>And the difference isn't just anecdotal: the &quot;wiring&quot; between the brain's two hemispheres is different in men and women. I don't pretend to know what that implies (and I think few scientists have even tried to get any grasp of it either, yet - maybe due to the social phobia that Vincent described elsewhere), except for this simple and safe conclusion: there is a difference. And by god does that make me happy - homogeneity is death. <BR> <BR>I honestly don't know about driving (I think it's mostly a cultural thing - like there are only two female tow truck drivers in the entire state of California, and such a low proportion can't be due [mostly] to physiology), but for example women do make better astronauts, apparently. Sadly, such distinctions are often ignored by people in power who are psychologically weak: <BR> <BR><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3042836.stm" target="_blank"><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3042836.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3042836.stm</a></a> <BR> <BR>Don't shoot for &quot;as good as&quot; - relish the diversity, and conquer your own glorious mountains. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>You know what's really funny? Much faster that the &quot;mother&quot; thread (pardon the pun), this thread went from being about cars to being about women&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
