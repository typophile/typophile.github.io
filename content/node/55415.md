  identifying this dingbat. Do dingbats technically count as typography? Anyway, your
  help would very much be appreciated, thank you in advanced. Also, if this is in
  the wrong forum, I apologize, please feel free to move.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dingbat_4604.jpg]"

  body: "Hello! I have this. It's metal though and since I acquired it second(or third?)-hand
    I have no idea what it's called. It unfortunately doesn't have any convenient
    identifying marks; I looked through a couple of specimen books and the closest
    thing I found was \"Old English No. 13\" in an ATF book from 1912. It's similar
    but not the same. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldenglish_3683.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    did find some crazy judgmental manicule people in another book, though. Completely
    off topic, but I think they're pretty great![img:sites/default/files/old-images/maniculeheads_6490.jpg]"

  body: "Aha! One Paul Ritcher of Devil's Tail Press found it! Posting on <a href=\"http://www.briarpress.org/19179\">Briar
    Press</a> he says:\r\n\r\n\"Typographer John Ryder in his book \u2018A Suite of
    Fleurons\u2019 dubbed it a Lyonnaise Arabesque. Originating from the Lyon printing
    office of Guillaume Rouille in about the year 1570, it may have been cut by Rouille
    or Pierre Roussin, assisted by Salomon or Robert Granjon. It was recut and cast
    in multiple sizes as Monotype 219. Francis Meynell and Stanley Morison in their
    essay \u201CPrinters\u2019 Flowers and Arabesques\u2019 published in The Fleuron,
    give the lineage: Michael Jouve and Pierre Roussin, 1551-1580; Jean Pillehote,
    1580-1600; Lamesle, 1742; Delacolonge, 1773; Ploos van Amstel, 1796 and Imprenta
    Real, 1799.\"\r\n\r\nSo there! \r\n\r\nAs for Digitization <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/glc/1550-arabesques/arabesques/characters.html\">here's</a>
    a sort of rough interpretation."
