    are part of your design or just becasue of a low-res jpeg!\r\n\r\nYou may want
    to post a different sample image where one can view the details better. It may
    also be an idea to use a PDF.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "If it's a PDF, I think you'd need to upload it on to your server and post
    a link.\r\n\r\nJpeg, gif etc. could also do the job provided the samples are slightly
    larger.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    came upon this design, and also perhaps the applications that you designed it
    for?\r\n\r\nBtw have you seen [[http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/Pixella/mudTyper+Weights|this]]? "

  body: "A, V, v, w, y are really too wide.\r\n\r\nThe b is aesthetically strange,
    but it probably helps legibility.\r\nYou might want to try to find a way to make
    the descender of the g not so big.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the design is nice and solid,
    though I think one pixel is missing from the diagonal of the M, and the serif
    on the bottom of the h may be closing it too much.\r\n\r\nThe numerals are my
    favorite. I like that they have their own height."

    of Zuzana Licko with Lo-Res, and some manual works that with the point we construct
    the letter. From this i came up with Punto.  "
