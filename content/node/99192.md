  body: "Don't know if it's actually a font, more a custom artwork and lettering for
    this special occasion.\r\nComplete illustration here: http://www.spd.org/2012/11/spd-48-call-for-entries-is-her.php\r\nWhen
    looking at this webpage, I noticed the script on the right \"Click Here! To Enter
    Pub 48\" wich I think should be [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=lavanderia|Lavanderia]].
    Now going back on the artwork, looks like \"Society of Publication Designers\"
    has been set in Lavanderia too. So may be, rest of the lettering \"Pub N 48\"
    could have been also derived from the same font.\r\nSame layering style but different
    design: [[http://ilovetypography.com/2012/01/13/interview-font-designer-kunihiko-okano/|Quintet]]
