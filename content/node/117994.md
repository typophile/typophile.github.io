  body: "Sample is awfully small, but the body text could be Directa Serif:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/directa-serif/\r\n\r\nIf
    you have the full version of Adobe Acrobat, open the file and go to File > Properties
    > Fonts, and you should see a list of all the fonts used in the PDF. \r\n\r\nOr,
    simply open the PDF with Illustrator, being sure to open a page that contains
    body copy. As Illustrator opens the page, you should see a dialogue box that tells
    you that fonts are missing--make note of the fonts listed.\r\n\r\nBonne chance."

  body: Even Adobe Reader will list the fonts embedded in a PDF (but not if they were
    converted to outline).
