		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can’t see why anyone would list membership in most graphic design organizations on business cards or a resume. Unlike architectural, industrial, and interior design associations, most graphic design organizations aren’t accrediting organizations, there are no qualifications to join them, they don’t regulate anything or intercede in matters on behalf of designers and clients, and in the case of NAPP, it’s really just an overpriced magazine subscription. Unless you’re just sucking up to someone who is a very active member of an organization and unlikely to hire nonmembers, it’s just window dressing.</p>
<p>And as for Typophile, the last time I was helping someone review resumes, people who added stuff like blogging and web forum activity to their resumes went right into the trash. Who wants to hire someone who spends so much time on web forums that he puts it on a resume?</p>

<p>A place that wants someone who will be a problem solver and up-to-date on current events in the industry. I had a job once where my job description included 5% for reading magazines and trade publications &hellip; that was pre-Web, I suspect today the same job might want a similar amount of time spent online.</p>

I&rsquo;m relatively new to the design world, my experience is still in it&rsquo;s infantry. I see listing memberships to these active design communities as a viable extension of my design education. I&rsquo;ve been part of several conferences hosted by NAPP and AIGA. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of helpful tips and expanded my design skills (albeit for specific programs) at these conferences too. Granted they&rsquo;re not nearly as ingrained into the community as other associations are with other professions. You have to agree they&rsquo;re recognized by most in the design community.</div>

<p>I’ll admit the Graphic Artist’s Guild does a heck of a lot. Honestly I forgot about it because I very rarely hear it mentioned outside of Typophile. As for the activities of the AIGA, TDC, and so on, those activities are certainly of great value. However, unless one happens to have been directly involved in making those things happen, they do not apply to one’s resume. My post was in no way intended to denigrate graphic design professional organizations, just to point out that simply being a member of one does little to qualify one for a job.</p>

<p>This might be a difficult thing to measure in the world of graphic design. So little differentiates us from the wide gamut that makes up the creative art world. Examinations would have to be very specific, and geared towards both knowledge and application. There would be so many fields of accreditation. Would you be expected to take several accreditations if you&rsquo;re an illustrator, web designer, typographer and production artist?</p>

<p>There are exceptions&hellip; for example, the TDC has some great <a href="http://www.tdc.org/events/education/index.html">classes and workshops</a>, and if you attend one, you can list it under &ldquo;Continuing Education&rdquo; on your resume.

<p>I might have a miscellaneous section for awards, extended learning/conferences, and memberships. I&rsquo;m a NAPP member and I&rsquo;m going to probably be joining AIGA again this year. But of all my memberships, I feel as if I get more out of my membership to Typophile.</p>
