  assigned the task of updating our order of service bulletin. I am not at all a design
  professional and so was wondering if anyone could suggest a more elegant way of
  defining the header than I have done ([[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzZXJtb25zZGV0b211fGd4OjViNGQ0OTg3ZWUxNDQwZWM|here
  is the pdf]]).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n- Tomas "

    a church bulletin would draw a big crowd :) \r\nRegardless of people's interest
    levels, for the sake of sharing I thought I would post what I came up with after
    tinkering all afternoon:\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Common_6446.png]"

  body: "I'm a preacher's kid and have made many bulletins over the years, so I hope
    you don't mind my comment... \r\n\r\nI did a quick Google for your church, and,
    if I found the right website, it appears that this bulletin is for short, outdoor
    services for homeless people.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, your entire bulletin looks
    a tad formal to me. Yes, I know it's a worship service, but it's an outdoor service
    which probably has a fairly casual atmosphere, and perhaps the worshipers themselves
    (who apparently are primarily homeless folks) are folks who prefer a more casual
    atmosphere. \r\n\r\nIn fact I've been to many casual and/or outdoor services which
    were structured so that no bulletin was needed at all.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, you
    might want to consider experimenting with a slightly more informal design. You
    might try avoiding all caps, have larger type, shorter line lengths, maybe even
    trying breaking it into 2 columns instead of 1, etc.  \r\n\r\nJust a thought."

    line. and also Tomi's use of upper & lower case which gives it a more approachable
    look than the original all caps.

    perhaps they would appreciate one thing in their lives with some formal structure?"

  body: "Thanks for all the comments!\r\n\r\n@ Tomi - Thanks for the suggestion. What
    did you think of the italics on the \"the\" and the \"of Cambridge\"? I thought
    it set of the \"Outdoor Church\" a bit but did you find it messy or distracting?\r\n\r\n@
    JamesM - You indeed found the right website. I considered going the informal route
    but decided against for a few reasons: \r\n1) although it is outdoors the liturgy
    we use is relatively formal (it's lifted almost word for word out of the Book
    of Common Prayer) \r\n2) in line with what John Hudson suggested, this is one
    of the few opportunities that many of our congregants have to participate in a
    community where their views, and to a large extent their personhood, are respected
    so I wanted that respect to carry over even into our bulletins.\r\n- I like the
    the two column idea. I'll give it a go.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
