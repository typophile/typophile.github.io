  one of those Edwardian revival styles of the 60s... Anyone got a clue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think I've answered my own question - It looks like Hawthorn (but somehow
    optically stretched horizontally or hand-redrawn?) A 1968 font by Michael Daines,
    reissued in 2004 by Linotype; E+F also have a version.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/hawthorn-lt/"

    might be a closer match than Hawthorn.

  body: "Andrew, I agree the proportions of Romana look closer, but the weights of
    Romana that match this have a flat top on the A, and the R leg angle seems different,
    I think maybe A.J. is right that this is Hawtorn that has been graphically manipulated
    into this shape.\r\n\r\nAt least all the MyFonts versions of Romana I saw had
    these differences.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think that it is someone's version of Devinne. Not the ornamental Devinne,
    but the boldface of Romana that ATF created and called Devinne - and other foundries
    mimicked. Opti, for one, offered a version years later with the pointed top to
    the 'A' and downward vee of the 'M' - as well as that 'R' as an alternate.\r\n\r\nJeff
    Levine's <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/hand-stamped/' target='_blank'>Hand
    Stamped JNL Regular</a> is a deliberately crude and inexact version of this."

  body: "Good work Mike. I knew something else had to be the answer, but I was having
    trouble imagining how I could get there with Hawthorn. I'm not at home, so I couldn't
    play with the actual font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    you were talking about. This is probably the actual answer, but I am saying this
    without putting them side to side.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Nice, Mike. Yeah, that is probably as close as A.J. is going to get in a digital
    font in 2010.
