body: "Font settings for a website always use the least common denominator. Fonts
  like Verdana and Georgia, sizes between 13 and 16 pixels and so on. This may not
  be appropriate for your 24 inch screen, but there is nothing you can do about it.
  You don't have much more influence besides telling your browser to make the type
  \xBBlarger\xAB.\r\n\r\nThis is fine for a website you visit just once, but on a
  website you visit day after day you may want to have your OWN settings based on
  YOUR fonts and YOUR display. Maybe you want to see the headlines in Warnock Pro
  and use Calibri for the body copy?\r\n\r\nFor our German typography website [[http://www.typografie.info|Typografie.info]]
  I have developed a system, that will allow the users to choose various font settings
  (including the fonts found on the user's system!) and apply them automatically to
  the website, everytime they will visit it. \r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info/local-fonts-in-html/\r\n\r\nIn
  the example above the font list is limited to a number of common fonts, that are
  known to work in an HTML environment. At the moment these are PC and Mac system
  fonts and some common Adobe fonts. \r\n\r\nIn theory, a user may choose any font
  on his machine, but since fonts with a name like \"Font Family SmBt Ital LF\" won't
  work in an HTML environment, this is may be a little bit too experimental. \r\nHere
  is the same script, but this time showing all fonts installed on the user's system:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info/local-fonts-in-html/index2.htm\r\n\r\nI
  appreaciate any comments on this system!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-10_4802.jpg]"

    obvious (type-)designers and maybe some computer affonciado's."

  body: "It's slick, for sure. Useful? Probably not. Folks that know/want to modify
    a particular site to that extent are probably already familiar with client-side
    options like greasemonkey and user style sheets.\r\n\r\nThat said, cuttin' makes
    a good point...perhaps this would be useful for the masses that like to customize
    their personal home pages to that extent. "
