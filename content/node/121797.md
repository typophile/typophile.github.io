body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a typeface this quarter for a school class
  and need some critique from you type experts. The name of my typeface is \"1800
  Something\" because it was Inspired by the \u201CFranklin TYPE Foundry - Book of
  Specimens Edition of 1889\u201D. The goal with this font was to use characteristics
  of 1800 typefaces and make them relevant again for type nerds alike. Basically i'm
  looking for any critique but I am specifically concerned with my drop shadow alternates,
  how can I make the drop shadow less illustrator stroke looking, it feels too blocky.
  \r\n\r\nThanks for any comments and all your critiques!\r\n\r\nKyle[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1800-something-specimen_5564.jpg]"

    strokes and the smoothness of letter shapes.\r\nAnyway, you could look at accomplished
    chromatic typefaces for clues (a suggestion: instead of applying some effect to
    one glyph, you could start placing one glyph over an identical one, then nudge
    it around until you're satisfied with the result)."

      need some work? I am new to font design and would appreciate some further feedback
      if you have the time.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I will start by saying that this style isn\u2019t exactly my cup of tea,
    so please keep in mind that some of my comments could be more a matter of taste
    than else.\r\nAlso, in your image the outlines look jagged, making it difficult
    to see if a problem lies in the curve or just in the rendering of it.\r\nIn random
    order:\r\n- |G|\u2019s top serif is different from anything else in the typeface.\r\n-
    The chisel-shaped \u201Cclosing\u201D serifs on |E|F|L|T| look a bit weak, and
    out of character next to the triangular ones.\r\n- Not a fan of the elephant-trunk-like
    middle arm of |E|.\r\n- |A| could be wider.\r\n- |&| could do with less overshot.\r\n-
    |R|\u2019s leg is a bit weak.\r\n- |C|\u2019s top and bottom curves look heavier
    than the vertical stroke.\r\n- Overall, horizontal and vertical strokes vary sensibly
    from letter to letter, not in an organic way.\r\n\r\nHope it helps."

  body: "I appreciate it riccardo, I will take a look at these points, I think you
    made some valid concerns. The type from these periods have a few letters that
    feel off from the rest of the alphabet, that was intentionally done, but maybe
    poorly on my part.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    is currently working on a similar typeface and might be able offer his thoughts.
