  guidelines for my company. We're very much stuck with Proxima Nova as our main font
  (it is used in Logo specifically). Which I don't mind - but I need help pairing
  a complementary serif font - specifically for use as a body copy (such as paragraphs
  in employee handbooks, press releases - printed materials).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?
  (examples would be nice too)"

    brand looks like / what you're trying to communicate about your company.

    could have had it very much worse! ;-)\r\n\r\nAs for suggestion pairs, what Penn
    rightly points out, and also which and how many features you need (weights, styles,
    language coverage, small caps, old style figures, etc.)."
