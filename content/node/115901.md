  Thierry La Fronde.\r\n\r\nhttp://ekladata.com/xyRVks1hPz8PGYISVGe1nPbjrAY.jpg\r\n\r\nIt
  has elements from the Amador, but not all. \r\nEspecially the\"r\" and  \"y\" is
  different.\r\n\r\nAlso many similarities with the Monotype  Engravers Old English,\r\nespecially
  \ the kapital \"T\", but the \"f\" differs. \r\nIts like a mix of the two.\r\n\r\nThanx
  in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n- Emil Brants"

    of _e_. But put Friedrich Bauer's Fette Gotisch of 1875 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fette-gotisch/
    on a diet and narrow the letters, and this is pretty much what you would get.
    The pen-stroke technique of Morris Fuller Benton's Wedding Text of 1901 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/wedding/
    is used for much of the finishing of the letters.\r\nDon"
