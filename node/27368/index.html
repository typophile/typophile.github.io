  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Interesting study... 

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060801/cltu530.html?.v=35

Not sure of the real world implications of this though...

<CITE>For example, people were more likely to predict underdogs when the questionnaire on which they made their predictions was printed in a difficult-to-read font. The increased effort provoked by reading the difficult font made people feel less confident in their intuitions, and they were more likely to predict underdogs as a result.</CITE>

I'll see if Kevin can shed any light on this.

		<div class="commentbody">Difficulty to read fonts has been used as an operationalisation of preference fluency (in this case caused by low perceptual (vs. conceptual) fluency) in other studies as well (also at yale school of management). 

Novemsky et al. (2004), for instance, used an italic embossed arial (i think), which looks very faint and hard to read. low fluency increases people's tendency to defer choice/choose not to choose, and to choose 'compromise options.'</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter is perfectly correct.

The authors of this study are manipulating the font selection to reduce the answerer's confidence: "Poor fonts reduce fluency, increase the feeling of difficulty, and, in turn, lower exam answer confidence."

In this study they used 9 point Tahoma at 100% contrast as their good font and 10 point Haettenschweiler at 25% contrast as their bad font.

The study is looking at how confidence impacts intuition. People are more likely to predict against their own intuition when their confidence is low.

From the typographic perspective it would be interesting to learn if the reduction in contrast or the font difference is responsible for the decrease in confidence.

		<div class="commentbody">So, easy-to-read encourages hasty decision-making.
Whereas hard-to-read encourages indecision.

Doesn't sound like faster-is-better is the right criteria for assessing readability...unless you want readers to endorse the status quo, rather than think for themselves.
The best thing is type that allows you to take your time in fully absorbing what's being said, nothing to do with the hard-/easy- to read axis. 
The best thing is type that's easy to read slowly. 
But how could that be measured?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone,

I suppose one application of this might be in election rigging - if the polls indicate that your candidate is the underdog, then by changing the font used by the touch screen voting machines to a hard-to-read font you could swing undecided voters towards that candidate. Conversely if your candidate is ahead in the polls, using a legible crisp font may reinfoce votes for them.

That's so true because often times, the type are so "buttery" to read to the point that you end up skipping over the words -- conceptually -- and losing comprehension in the process. This is true, especially when the materials are to be read in full focus.

My case has been reading Bringhurst's <em>Elements</em> at 9:45 pm one gloomy Tuesday night. Has it been the case with anyone?</div>
