  body: "We had [[http://www.typophile.com/node/46105|another Arquitectura post]]
    recently, and it's basically an edited version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/casablanca-rr/casablanca-rrcond-alt-light/|Casablanca
    Condensed]], which is another name for a Spanish typeface by Carlos Winkow called
    Electra (a name also used for serif typeface by W. A Dwiggins). It's not just
    a coincidence that the Jaspert sample of \"Electra Estrecha Fina\" includes the
    word ARQUITECTURA.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
