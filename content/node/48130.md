  rather like this kind of font: no serifs, no tail on either the b or the d. But
  I don't know much about typography, so I'd be very grateful if somebody could tell
  me the name of the font and/or the name of this <em>kind</em> of font (is there
  a family into which it belongs?).\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nSam"

  body: "Ok, I've found [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4&subpage=viewfonts|this
    page]] with what I think are different weights/styles of Chalet. The 1970 ones
    are closest to what I'm after, but they have a slanted bar in the 'e'. Ideally,
    I'd want a straight bar.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1B.html|Harry]]
    is pretty close too, but has a curved descender on the y, whereas I prefer a straight
    descender.\r\n\r\nThe hunt is on!"

  body: "If it weren't for its dratted e, [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces7.html|Tschicholina]]
    would fit the bill. Unlike the font in the headphones publicity, it has no stem
    (is this the correct term?) on the r, but that doesn't bother me.\r\n\r\nPS. Lex,
    I meant to thank you in my last post, for getting the ball rolling! Thanks :)"

  body: "Hi Sam,\r\n\r\nYes, I meant Chalet 1970, not 1960.\r\n\r\nChalet was designed
    to be mixed and matched, so the 'e' could be from one of the other \"years\",
    although on closer inspection, your original sample looks more like a modified
    Avant Garde to me (the narrow 'r' gives it away).\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    makes sense to me. How I would duplicate those modifications in my own work is
    something I guess I'd have to research..."
