  body: The update of the numbers & symbols & an alteration of the original W which
    was far too wide. Accents have been made also, but are not included in this character
    map.

  body: "I would hope that you will get more expert opinions than my own, but, I like
    the Stencil much better than the Regular. It may be the white on blue on my laptop
    monitor, but the Regular is not nearly as crisp... many features are lost, particularly
    in the numerals ('2', f'rinstance, has no counter to speak of).\r\n\r\nI LOVE
    the Stencil W. what a nice solution to a cumbersome char.\r\n\r\ngeo."

  body: The A and the V, W, X, Y, Z all have angled cuts while the rest are vertical.
    I would think that it might be more interesting to mix it up a bit more. Rounded
    sans and rounded stencil sans are so cuddly. I just want to hug them.

  body: "I actually started off with the stencil, but halfway through the alphabet
    decided to make a regular version as well. It's not a \"good\" stencil (the @
    & the % still have gaps that would get lost if stencilled), but I was just aiming
    for the stencil effect. The W was really bad at first (much too wide compared
    to the rest), but I'm quite pleased with the second version.\r\nI might try to
    make some alternate letters to mix it up a bit more."

  body: "Nice work ill\r\n\r\nI agreed with Miss Tiffany. >At first look, I really
    like your slant line with the V, W, but I think the S need more attention. Samething
    for the M. I'm no sure that the vertical \xABcut\xBB is the best way to thoses
    letters.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "agree on the Kada thing. \r\nIMO you need to find some more personality.
    Now it just feels like a font inspired by Kada. And why would I want to use your
    when Kada is better? "
