  for a community called 'booze free'? Its for young(ish) 'hip' people who want to
  live life without alcohol. One idea I had was to use a font popular with the brewery
  / alcohol industry in a subversive stylee ;-)\r\n\r\nany ideas?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nLuke."

    with \"booze\" that it will work for you. An homage to a particular label would
    be more likely to work visually.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't get, in general, is defining
    a group in relation to something they don't participate in. By the time you've
    named the group, and then strapped the members with a mark that recalls some alcohol
    product it would seem that you've put an almost obsessive emphasis on something
    you don't have in common and maybe don't want to emphasize. \r\n\r\nThere is a
    Pabst font that you might consider."

  body: "thanks for the replies! I appreciate the point regarding putting emphasis
    on something you don't have in common so that is useful in itself. I should also
    point out that this is not a commercial project. The point of calling it booze-free
    was just so that it sounded a bit less stiff like 'the anti-alcohol group' or
    the 'we are no fun at all and prefer knitting to having a good time' group.\r\n\r\nthanks
    again."
