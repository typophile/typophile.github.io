  asking me to recreate it in high quality resolution.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the BM
  font is \"Arial Rounded MT Bold\" and the \"a\" looks like \"Bella Donna\" but is
  not the same. Could someone please help me to identify the font names of the orange
  \"a\" and the text \"Budomart America\"?\r\n\r\nI really hope it's a font I can
  find for free haha.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo Budo 1_4491.jpg]"
