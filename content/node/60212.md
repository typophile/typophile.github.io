  how many fonts I have, It would take days to look through them. I tried the usual
  methods like identifont and what font, etc. Thank you in advance for any pointers,
  I really do not want to draw the letters I need from this small sample sent by a
  client.\r\nMani"

  body: "I have a font called Rubloff from the old Expresiv Ornate font collection
    done by NovelFonts. My notes say it is really Rubens Wood (a.k.a. Kildare). They
    flattened it a bit (my sample is 83% normal height), but I would bet this is what
    they used.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RubloffPLAZA_4706.gif]"
