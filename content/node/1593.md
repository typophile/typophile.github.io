  be a custom design just for logo sake, but i want to be sure. Anybody? <BR> <BR>Thanks<img

  body: What is the source of these images? It looks like some 1920&#39;s advertising
    copy.  In that case we will be lucky to identify the typeface, but of course that
    doesn&#39;t mean a &#40;digital&#41; font exists for it. So far it looks like
    drawn lettering, since the identical letters seem to have small variations.

  body: Rajar films and paper. As far as I know its a british company who sold, yes,
    film and paper. The photo sensitive kind. The pictures come from an advertisement
    from around 1910. I too think it&#39;s drawn lettering. The difference between
    the 2 A&#39;s gives that away I&#39;d say. Finding a similar type is hard. I appreciate
    the feedback so far. Thanks guys.

  body: 'The most useful thing I can suggest for something that old, is to look at
    one of the sites that specialize in revivals of very old typefaces. Dave Nalle&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.ragnarokpress.com/scriptorium/" target="_blank">Scriptorium</a>
    has the most antique typefaces, as far as I know, although all the names have
    been changed. I am fairly familiar with the Scriptorium collection, and I don&#39;t
    think your style is in there, but you might see something that you&#39;d consider
    similar enough for whatever your purposes are. '
