  this a personal identity for a portfolio/blog site. I've been through lots of sketches
  and I'm at this point trying a purely typographic mark, though I'm not necessarily
  sold on that approach. The kerning on \"digital\" needs some work but I'm more looking
  to see if the overall idea is working at this point. Any feedback or ideas for other
  typeface combinations or other directions to try greatly appreciated, thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fd_sketch04_5808.jpg]"

    profound.\r\n\r\nAs for the fi ligature...I'm not sure if it's needed. "

  body: "Hmm...well, 'fig' could certainly be the primary element, with 'figdigital.com'
    being a tagline or supporting mark.\r\n\r\nI guess my point is that 'fig' is much
    more interesting/unique than 'digital' and, as it is now, the 'digital' has the
    emphasis. "

  body: "I'd like to see \"digital\" not in italic, and grey.  Or other ways of emphasizing
    \"fig\" - right now the ligature is in visual competition with the \"D\", to me.\r\n\r\nOn
    your site - is \"in theatres\" in Gotham?   Either way, if \"digital\" were to
    look more like that, and be de-emphasized colorwise, I think it would look pretty
    sweet."

  body: Good thoughts, thanks guys. And yes eeblet, Gotham on the splash page (I've
    had a slightly unhealthy addiction to Gotham recently). That could work well,
    I'll play with it a bit tonight and see what might work.

    get a lighter gray tone of type to work well, but by going with a thinner weight
    I think it balances much better. thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fd_sketch05_3671.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
    also sketching a bit on an \"fd\" mark with sort of similar shapes rotated 180
    degrees...not sure how that'll develop yet."

    better than your original, but it still needs something.  IMO.  :)"

  body: "Good thoughts guys. and eeblet, aluminum nailed it...i did tons of sketching,
    research, etc., and a fig is a horribly unidentifiable shape :) I have played
    with the fig leaf concept and haven't yet hit on one I like, while I think the
    concept has some potential I want to stay away from the scripty leafy trend but
    i'm not at all opposed to the concept. logosam, i tried a pixel approach like
    that as well but kind of leaned away from it as i thought it might give an appearance
    of being too digital/web-centric.\r\n\r\nThat being said, here's two revisions
    on a combination of earlier discussed comments. I'm leaning towards the linear
    version, or do you guys think I should explore some other concepts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fd06_4423.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fd07_4047.jpg]\r\n"

    to grey now that you have the size contrast working better.\r\n\r\nTo nitpick...I'm
    still not convinced the fi ligature works. The g seems disconnected. I'd maybe
    try one with a slight gap between the bar of the f and the i. "

  body: "Those both look nice, although I agree with Darrel about the fi - to me,
    it seems stilted.  The f & i are so starkly parallel, that the small curve of
    the f is the only thing holding the g in.\r\n\r\nI was being kind of jokey about
    the fig - as in, \"well, I'd rather illustrate 'fig' than 'digital' if I had to
    illustrate something\" - but now I'm wondering if an abstracted fig behind the
    vertical arrangement of \"fig digital\" wouldn't soften things up?  Something
    like this, only not looking like it was drawn in MS paint (I think figs have a
    quite distinctive shape...):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fig3_5872.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    probably not.  :)"
