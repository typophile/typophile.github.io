  legitimate because it included ads for legit sites selling fonts (e.g. fonts.com).
  \ Seen statements that AGP is not not available free, but those are a couple of
  years old, so thought AGP had been freed.\r\n\r\nNow worried that's not so.  Will
  delete AGP if pirated.  Hope not.  Love Adobe Garamond; others don't compare.  Can't
  justify buying it.  Not a designer, just a writer with newfound font fetish.\r\n\r\nWhat's
  the truth about Adobe Garamond Pro's copyright status, cost at this point in time?\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'About the Ads: It seems that Fonts.com has an agressive marketing campaign,
    so as to appear with anything having to do with fonts (a Google AdWords kind of
    technique I assume). So they also appear on illegal sites like the ones you stumbled
    upon. Free download sites are to be suspected, so one always has to double check
    if what they claim is legit. Also check the license (EULA) which will also tell
    ou something. Anyway: Ads don''t legitimize sites in any way, as the mostly operate
    seperately from the content of the site.'

    one is can be used without concern, the quality is quite alright, it is an older
    digitalization of Stempel Garamond which is now free. However in this version
    the small caps are actually petite caps and the old style figures have way too
    much distance between the figures, at least in the software I use. If you use
    it with lining figures and normal capitals for abbreviations it will serve your
    well. \r\n\r\n\r\nEB Garamond is an ambitions project as it aims to be true to
    the original Garamond. It is currently in development and the status is beta or
    alpha even for bold and italics. \r\nRegular: https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond/tree/master/otf\r\nItalics
    and Bold: https://github.com/georgd/EB-Granjon/tree/master/OTF\r\n\r\nSo tradeoffs
    everywhere... The Adobe Garamond isn't that expensive for a font."

  body: Btw, if you are a writer, normally all you need are regular and italic style
    (which include smallcaps etc). IIRC, the license fee for individual styles is
    pretty modest at the Adobe site, especially if you're in the US, so that you can
    have a proper license for the equivalent of a good book. The real question is
    if you really need it for what you do.

    didn't know about EB Garamond.  Just went and got it.  It feels very nice.  Makes
    me happy.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nWhat does alpha mean for a typeface?  Spacing might
    be poor?  Uneven color?  Characters have other design flaws?  Or worse--tops of
    characters get cut off or something horrible like that?  I'm just learning to
    see details of typefaces.  I'm sure that most of it passes me by, except unconsciously,
    presumably."

  body: "Thanks T.R.-\r\n\r\nI know what alpha vs. beta vs. 1.0 vs. the rest mean
    in the context of general software development, testing, and use.  I've experienced
    all of them both as a programmer and as a user. (1.0: \"It's beta, but we have
    cash flow problems.\" :-)\r\n\r\nI don't know what's implied by these terms for
    a digital typeface.  If EB Garamond were still in an alpha state for its roman
    fonts, would that mean \"Don't complain to us if it crashes your typesetting/wordprocessing/whatever
    program, and there's a good chance it will\", or \"It's supposed to look like
    original Garamond, but only some of the characters are close\", or \"might look
    fine at 12 pts but could look wacky at 36 pts--and again, don't complain to us\"?
    \ I'm a novice in this world, so I don't have a sense of what sorts of things
    count as showstoppers, and what sorts of things count as annoyances which one
    can choose to work around.  I've noticed no problems or things that bother me
    so far using EB Garamond's roman, italic, and bold at text sizes with XeLaTeX.
    \ I've learned to notice certain things about fonts in recent months, but I'm
    sure that miss a lot.  Maybe for a designer there can be glaring problems with
    a typeface that make \"alpha\" the appropriate term, while I just blithely abuse
    readers by giving them documents in the same typeface.\r\n\r\n(Yes, URW Garamond
    No. 8 is the one I haven't found moving--thanks for clarification Andre.)"

  body: "For a font or face in alpha, expect roughness of all kinds; hinting/kerning,
    if any, somewhat short of exact; not all glyphs there yet; glyphs reshaped, sometimes
    drastically, as time passes. This sort of thing. Very similar to programs, in
    fact.\r\n\r\nIn beta, a face would be mostly finished but in need of tuning. You
    may get some odd OpenType substitutions, including none. A beta test needs a lot
    of pathological test cases to weed out the bogosity. Again, just like programs.
    Do your French and German quotes sit right where they should? What happens if
    you turn on historical ligatures within small-caps within swashes?"
