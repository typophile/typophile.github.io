  body: "I doubt this is possible with nested styles (but I'm not very experienced
    with them yet, so maybe a crack may can help you).\r\n\r\nWhat you could do: use
    the \"next style\" feature.\r\n\r\nDefine in your question style that the next
    style should be the answer style.\r\nIf you assign the question style to a paragraph,
    the following paragraph will automatically be set in answer-style.\r\nIt is not
    quite as fast, but at least it's semi-automatic.\r\n\r\nAs your document is not
    uniformly structured, I doubt full automation will be possible."

  body: "You may try to do this with find/replace method - since your questions end
    with question mark or colon, and your answers with full stop. You can find them
    and automatically change to different paragraph style. If you insist on using
    nested styles, you find them and automatically ad a mark that nested styles can
    recognize, eg. non-breaking space, em- or en-space, etc. and configure nested
    styles as img. below shows:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nested_4740.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nAntoni"

  body: "Hi Dustin,\r\n\r\nSebastian is right; this is a typical case for \u2018Next
    Style\u2019.\r\n\r\nTwo minor problems:\r\n\r\n1. You have an empty paragraph,
    separating an answer from the next question.\r\nYou could introduce a third paragraph
    style (\u2018Separator\u2019), and specify this sequence:\r\n\r\n\u2018Question\u2019
    followed by \u2018Answer\u2019 followed by \u2018Separator\u2019 (followed by
    \u2018Question\u2019 again).\r\n\r\nBut actually, that wouldn\u2019t be very elegant.
    You should get rid off this extra paragraph (search for <code>^p^p</code> and
    replace by a single <code>^p</code>), and rather give the \u2018Answer\u2019 style
    a bottom margin (via paragraph style options). \r\n\r\n2. You must not have hard
    breaks within your paragraph (because they would trigger a new one). Thus, your
    \u2018three things list\u2019 should have soft breaks. And you don\u2019t need
    soft breaks in your second-last answer (though they won\u2019t hurt either).\r\n\r\nWhen
    you have set up your styles, select all your text and simply ctrl-click on on
    your first style (\u2018Question\u2019) and choose \u2018Apply this style and
    then the next style\u2019 \u2013 or whatever it is called in the English menu.\r\n\r\nF
