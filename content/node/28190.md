  \r\nSeen here used by Pentagram (top) + Build (main) - is this the same typeface?\r\nHelp
  appreciated. Thanks, Andy."

  body: "Yeah there are some subtle differences from Caslon 3 Italic -\r\nthe A above
    is pointed for instance. The example above seems lighter overall.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caslon-3-italic_5324.jpg]"
