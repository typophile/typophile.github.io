  I am looking for a playful font, and the best font I have found at the moment is
  Oldenburg.  The designer I am working with doesn't like Oldenburg, and he suggests
  we go with a cleaner font, such as Roboto Slab.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that you could
  take a look at these two wire frames, and let me know whether the Oldenburg works,
  and if not whether you knew a font that might work?\r\n\r\nThank you for taking
  a look!\r\n\r\n"
