  body: "I would say that legibility is more to do with handwriting (doctors' prescriptions
    are the archetypical item in the field) whereas readability is concerned with
    texts that are set in type. The latter term entails the relative ease or difficulty
    we have in reading a column of text. Eye comfort could be an equivalent expression.
    Variants such as the width of the column in relation to type size and interlinear
    space (leading) are essential factors that determine the degree of readability
    of a text. Type size alone is also a factor but this is usually less important
    than leading and column width. The design of the type is another factor: some
    types (Utopia or for example) require considerable leading in most settings because
    of an unusually large x-height. Other more classical romans (like most of the
    digital ones named Garamond) usually look good and can be read easily even in
    fairly wide columns because of the small x-height which naturally provides space
    between the lines which are only occasionally occupied by the relatively long
    descenders and ascenders. Readability also has to do with the designs of type
    that we are familiar with reading in books or other publications. We have difficulty
    with reading texts of more than a few words in uppercase simply because we have
    been brought up on lowercase for continuous texts. Likewise most of us would have
    some difficulty reading any text set in a gothic type (or Blackletter type if
    you are American).\r\nNevertheless, there are occasions when illegibility is also
    a problem which concerns type. Two examples that one frequently sees are: a) texts
    that have been set in light types or delicate neo-classical types such as Bauer
    Bodoni or Didot and have been printed white or in a light colour on a dark ground:
    the ink-spread (which will happen to some degree even in offset printing) tends
    to fill in the delicate strokes and the hairlines \u2013 especially in small sizes
    of type; b) when type (headline or text) runs over a photogaphic background which
    disturbs immediate perception of words. "

  body: "Legibility used to mean the ability to decifer symbols as in identify glyphs
    or alphanumeric characters. Readability was initially intended to distinguish
    the comfort level in reading running text. It was assumed that you could identify
    the glyphs but all the other reading factors also came into play including line
    length and leading, etc..\r\nToday, there is confusion among the masses and it
    seems only scientists and typophiles differentiate any more :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"
