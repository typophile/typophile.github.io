body: "Hi all (again)!\r\n\r\nIn my \"readings\" I found an type designed by a Portuguese
  typography offer to the King (at the time). See picture.\r\nMy investigations lead
  me to similar types. But again, I need the \"pros\" feedback.\r\nIs this already
  in use? I mean some typeface equal?\r\nI would love to digitize it, but dont want
  to find something equal out there.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\nAnt\xF3nio[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tuga_4470.jpg]"
