body: "Hi there\r\nI have stayed away from Metrics Classes in Fontlab up until now
  because of the 'disappearing Metrics Classes' bug. Is that bug gone now with the
  5.0.3 release?\r\n\r\nThe case is that I would love to use Metrics Classes in my
  MM font. I have a set of working Kerning Classes that I use for the two endpoints
  in my MM design. Can I use the same set of Kerning Classes as Metrics Classes somehow?
  And if I can, then how do I set it up without breaking anything?"

  body: "Okay I have set up set of metrics classes by hand, but the functionality
    seems rather flaky. Sometimes the preview in the Metrics Assistance windows is
    way off, and when I turn on \"Use the measurement line\" on it's way off in another
    way. A restart of Fontlab seems to fix it for a time before the strange preview
    appears again \u2013 a bug?\r\n\r\nAlso, is it correct that I can only choose
    to use the measurement line globally, and not pr. class? When I press \"Apply
    and save\" it runs through all the classes that are turned on, as in I can't set
    and apply the settings pr. class?"

  body: "A bit late ... <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/downloads/KLTF-KerningToMetricsClasses.zip\">this
    script</a> creates an equivalent metrics class for every kerning class. Also sorts
    into OT, kerning and metrics classes. (Note: It will remove all existing metrics
    classes. Also, you need to turn on kerning/metrics classes by hand.)\r\n\r\nHm,
    I don't use metrics classes."

  body: "Thanks Karsten\r\nAny users of Metrics Classes that wan't to chip in? How
    do you use Metrics Classes? Is it a matter of having very fine grained classes
    with strictly identical shapes? Then what about i with diacritics?"

  body: "I'm currently working on FontLab 504 in Mac OS 10.6.8. I'm newby to font
    metric classes and looking for someone to guide me in this tedious work. I have
    defined a new metric class by hand, my key glyph has their LSB and RSB set, composites
    have different values, How do i transfer the key values to the composites by class?
    I'm avoiding the obvious copy paste special process.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.
    PD. I'm figuring out how metric class works."

  body: "Ok, I figured out. First you have to create the metric class \u2013either
    by hand or in auto mode (this last one isn't that precise)\u2013; open the Metrics
    Assistance under Tools menu and check the classes you want to apply. That's it!
    click Apply and Save button.\r\n\r\nFor the I and their accented composites, you
    will have to use the measurement tool and meke sure to check it, so, the LRS and
    RSB will be copied from the stem, and not from the very edge of the bounding box.\r\n\r\nHope
    this works. =)"

  body: "I've yet to really solve the i diacritic issue but what I do is establish
    a class for the left side of say, the letter /o/ and use it for the c,e, and whatever
    else has the same left side shape. I then make a class for the left & width of
    where the original letter is used to define the diacritic characters. For ligatures,
    I have a class for the right side. \r\n\r\nI hope that made sense."

  body: "An alternative to using Metric Classes, \r\nwill be to write a script to
    set the metrics for you.\r\n\r\nIn the first lines you can define the left and
    right side bearings for the typical letters.\r\nThen you define the groups, and
    finally you apply the changes.\r\n\r\nThis way you can update everything quick
    and easy.\r\n\r\nBut it's just an idea, still have to learn python.\r\nMaybe you
    can write it Claus :)"
