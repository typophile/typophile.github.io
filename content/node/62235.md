body: "Hi Guys, Im looking for some advice for this logo,  a freind who's got a great
  writing style is doing a custom signature style logo for me (my father actually)
  and Im looking for advice on how best to combine the supporting text with it.\r\n\r\nDue
  to the odd outline shape of the signature Im finding it hard to sit it next anything
  comfortably.  Do any of you have any good examples or advice on how best to combine
  heavily scripted hand rendered styles with supporting sans serifed text like this?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help.\r\nGeorge\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_06B_5431.jpg]"

    resembles too much an \u201CI\u201D.\r\nThe signature\u2019s capital \u201CA\u201D
    appears to be a little weak."

    Have you tried putting \"DESIGN\" above the line, and \"DEVELOP\" below? \r\n\r\nThe
    wide set width of the sans font might be causing some of the uncomfortable union
    you speak of.  I might try a sans serif that's tall, like the script is, for more
    unity. "

  body: I like the bottom one! Would love to see the text optically centered below
    the signature.

    telling the person looking at your logo to design, develop and consult. It doesn't
    read as <em>you</em> doing those things. The last two are definitely your best
    options there. \r\n\r\npenn"

    other is a lot more reserved.\r\n\r\nDepends what you're going for I guess.\r\n\r\nFirst
    versions reflected best to me without knowing more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

    the same block as the signature. No reason they can't be separated a bit more."
