  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear Typofiles,

I've been luking around for a while following one clever thread after another having all my questions asked and answered for me. But there is one one subject i havent been able to find an ansver to... 

My problem at hand drove me to create a profile and step into the light: Hello :)


Ive worked in the graphic design industry for 10+ years or so and I have yet to do a typeface. That is about to change - I've set a goal to make a display type, uppercase with numurals within a 3 month timeframe. I is important to note that I see all this as a learning process and that learning is one of my key motivators.

Am I being overly ambitious? 

Do I underestimate factors like Learning software, kerning and finetuning? 

I'll be working on this project alongside my normal workload and I know that my skill level, ability to learn software etc. is a huge factor but how much time do you usually allocate to your projets? 

I know that time will tell if I can meet my deadline or laugh at my own ignorance, but for now im just setting up some goals to push myself forward.

Since this is a new process for me I plan is to make some milestones - Any input would be more than welcome - So far i have something like this planned out:


1. Concept fase, 5-7 carecters hand drawn or Illustrator to determine the overall style

2. Reversion

3. Fontlab learning, reading playing  

4. Carecter redraw (or copy from Illustrator and finetune) in fontlab

5. Reversion

6. Design rest of carecters

7. Design numurals

8. Fine tuning

9. Kerning, testing, kerning, testing ...

10. Check up on legal stuff

11. Release (champagne and french fries)


Am I on the right track? </div>

Other great things about sketching all of the characters out, you can do it virtually anywhere - even laptops have their limitations. And, you can sketch thoughts and accept or reject several variations quickly. 

If you are married or attached, you might explain to you spouse before you start about font widows...

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for your input,

First off - my intention is to start on paper (my usual process with most design even though i tend to work very loosly in this phase - I have a feeling i need to be more precise with typography) - Ill take Kentles advise and get to know my tool of choice first :) 

Thank you for "10.5. Create specimen document and interesting samples" phrostbyte64 - Im sure I will relish that specifik part of the project. Better half is not advised but for her it will just be another one of my nerdy pasttimes ;)

Eben, I know everybody underestimates thats why im curious as to how long both amatous and pro use - It will help me put things into perspective...  </div>

Seriously, I'd say go for it &ndash; start out and ride along! Having a voice in the back of your head that's telling you what should be a "normal" timeframe for this, and what "stage" of the process you should now be in, might just put too much pressure on you. If this is about learning for you, you will need time to play, to explore, to compare, and to examine what others have done; to do and re-do. I think if you try to stick too closely to a fixed plan you might get frustrated. (FWIW, with my first font I ended up making the complete lowercase alphabet three times from scratch until I was satisfied with the shapes and proportions. I'm not saying that's normal! But it can happen to a beginner, and I think is much better than feeling you "have" to stop because you don't have any time left, even if you're not satisfied.)

Note that you left out spacing in your plan. As far as I understand things (and I'm still a beginner as well), it's very important to get spacing down as far as possible before starting out with kerning. 
But anyway, I'd question if type design is really such a linear process as your chart suggests. :)</div>
