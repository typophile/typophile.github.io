body: "I am seeking advice for a font to be used for a corporate identity package,
  for a food hall based in London, UK.\r\nThe customer would like to portray high
  perceived value, and should have mass market appeal.\r\n\r\nThe project is based
  upon an underlying narrative of, new life being breathed into a \"tired, archaic
  \"  building. It really tells a story of the  juxtaposition of New and Old....a
  repurposing with a new concept.\r\n\r\nThe project is a redevelopment of a 500,000
  sqft building, built circa 1862. The repurposing of the space will include a 45,000
  sqft  food hall, that will provide  Artisan quality foods offered by business operators
  with an operational history, generations deep.\r\n\r\nI know that Goudy Old Style
  has its fair share of opinions,  but there are certain elements that I do like about
  this font set\r\nPrimarily, it's soft rounded serifs . I'd really like to hear your
  opinions and advice, for alternative fonts that I might try to illustrate the points
  mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\nJeremy\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As far as i recall Goudy Old Style is already taken by some big British warehouse
    (or defintely was, though i do not exactly remember which one it was), therefore
    i would not recommend using this typeface. There are lots of other Antique styled
    typefaces with soft rounded serifs. Look at all the different Garamonds, for example.\r\nBetween
    old & new maybe something in the direction of a <a href=\"http://typematters.de/tmt_MS.html\">typeface
    without serifs</a> would do the job also pretty well. The roundness can be found
    in its italic."

  body: Given the history and artisanal aspects, Garamond Premier might be a good
    Garamond for the purpose.

  body: 'The notion of "Britishness craftmanship", implied in Jeremy''s request, brings
    to mind the work of Eric Gill: excluding the overused Gill Sans, perhaps one should
    try to have a look at some of his serif typefaces - Joanna, Perpetua, Golden Cockerel
    or Aries.'

  body: Some of Fred Goudy's other faces might do you, and may be slightly less ubiquitous.
    Kennerley, Deepdene, or Californian, for example.
