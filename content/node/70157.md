    HypeforType caters to display faces for young trendy designers. Personally, I
    think FontShop would be a much better fit.

  body: "<cite>I think you should be more discreet about potential business deals.</cite>\r\n\r\nUsually
    I am rather discreet, if I may say so; however, what do you mean by that in this
    case? I have nothing to hide here. I have been contacted out of the blue by this
    man and just thought to ask others wether this is an option to consider.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, he wrote much about quality and talent, yet a browsing of HFT fonts teached
    me otherwise."
