body: When perusing old phototype catalogs, I was surprised to notice how many typefaces
  had no true italics, just mechanically slanted versions, sometimes this is even
  the case for serif faces. Was this done because the foundries assumed people would
  just mechanically slant faces and did not offer italics/obliques, or because the
  typesetters were keeping profits up by not buying the italic/oblique fonts?

  body: When you say "Phototype," which technology are you referring to? The Phototypositor
    & clones? The photocomposition machines from Linotype (like the VIP) & the other
    manufacturers? I used a photocomposition machine that employed a rotating disk
    negative system with a lens system, and there was no way to "mechanically slant"
    characters. You wanted italic, you bought the italic font -- though usually, it
    came on the same disk as the roman & you bought it perforce.

  body: It was done with special lenses. From the point of view of a lot of typesetters
    (the people, not the machines), the ability to slant the characters was considered
    an innovation, a time-saver. It was something you couldn't do with metal type.
    Same with condensing and extending. To a lot of people, though, especially type
    lovers, it was a cheap trick and something to avoid. This is still true of digital
    type, even more so because so many people who set type now (just about anyone
    with a computer) don't know the difference.
