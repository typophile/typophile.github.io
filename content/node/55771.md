  then, when doesn't the client have these?\r\n\r\nFor example, he wants his product
  to use a light bulb... yeah It's too cliche for me but he's the client. The logo
  is for software apps... the trick is that he wants icons too. SO I extended the
  light bulb logo to implement through the icons too... like so:\r\n\r\nIt is what
  it is. Obviously very riffed, very early, and just throwing it out there... The
  thing is he turned it down and said he wants more \"3D\" and more Helvetica rounded...
  he pointed me to this... yikes!\r\n\r\nSo I decided I needed to see some stuff with
  Helvetica rounded that I like. I'm just having a hard time finding good logos with
  it off the top of my head. \r\n\r\np.s.... be nice:)"

    yeah if it wasn't clear right of then that's not good.\r\n\r\nSeriously don't
    expect much.. it is scrappy madness."

    is naming a web company something nonsensical... that trend is not so rad. (i.e.
