body: I'd like to use this font on my website, but so far I have yet to be able to
  identify it. Nothing I have in my collection of fonts looks even close. I've marked
  the font in particular that I want identified.

  body: "This comes up every few weeks. The \"font\" is internal to the printer and
    does not necessarily match a font that you could use on your website.\r\nThat
    having been said, you might be happy with a web-font semi-bold version of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/\r\n\">Proxima
    Nova</a> by Mark Simonson, which has essentially the same letter forms and numbers.
    The only obvious difference is the lack of a serif at the base of 1. If you are
    really observant you will find that the upper tip of 6 dips slightly more an the
    printer font.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: I think it looks a lot like Tahoma and not like Proxima Nova at all.
