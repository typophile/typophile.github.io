  body: 'I&#39;m realizing that part of the problem is resolution/visibility: people
    want their design to be highly visible, but since screen resolutions are so much
    lower than your eye, the graphics are made larger than they&#39;d normally be.
    I know that &#34;the boys&#34; give us zoomed views sometimes, but that seems
    to be mainly when some type is totally illegible &#40;and probably when one of
    them isn&#39;t on vacation&#41;, as opposed to for counteracting the &#34;diluting&#34;
    effect of low resolution. Maybe next year every shirt should have an automatic
    zoom of the pritable area&#40;s&#41;, preferably provided by the submitter. <BR>

  body: It&#39;s a little joke about the two moderators of the type id forum. A tad
    obscure but more connected to the world of typography, I&#39;d wager, than a rooster
    and a dog. <BR> <BR>Unless, of course, the rooster and dog represent the Chinese
    astrological signs of two famous typophiles. If that is the case, and the designer
    of the shirt meant the rooster to represent me, since I am indeed a rooster &#40;on
    the near-cusp of dog, it should be noted&#41;, then that shirt is automatically
    my favorite.

    actually a revision of a design posted on day 19, which, due to administrative

    &#40;by Joe&#41;. They&#39;re done by two different designers &#40;USA &amp; Germany&#41;
