  Dafont with no success.\r\nFirst I thought it was a logo drawn from scratch but
  I found some other very similar letter in a banner, so I suspect it is based on
  an existing font...\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen_5733.jpg]"

  body: Most probably custom job. I think you could get very close with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/bitsumishi-pro/|Bitsumishi
    Pro]] (rounding /G's bottom right corner, moving /R's leg to right) or at least
    its [[http://www.dafont.com/bitsumishi.font|free version]] (same work as previous
    plus closing letters).

    so directly).\r\nThanks!"
