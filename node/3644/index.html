I have been labouring through the night, driven by a surge of adrenalin brought about by a university acceptance. So here it is... Dent ... at least most of teh characters. s,u,v,w,x,y,z are still to be done in lc. no uc have yet been done. Am I doing everything wrong here?

BTW: the angel of the &#39;t&#39; down-stroke and the &#39;f&#39; up-stroke looks very different to the others round shapes. &#40;dont need to be the same... maybe it is only my own flavor&#41; <BR> <BR>The &#39;n&#39; needed a little improvement at the left stem. <BR> <BR>&#39;d&#39; where the bowl go in to the stem looks round at the punch but linear a the outside &#40;hope you understand what i mean&#41; <BR> <BR>The &#39;m&#39; is to small <BR> <BR>okay hope this helps a little <BR> <BR>Greetings Jens </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Very nice start. Reminds me a lot of Bernhardt &#40;Agfa&#41; or Bernhard &#40;Font Company&#41;. I think overall your spacing is a little tight. &#40;Although you probably aren&#39;t addressing spacing just yet.&#41;  I agree with the remarks made by Jens overall. It looks as if you are designing a monolinear design, but I think the main vertical strokes on all the characters &#40;which have them&#41; would benefit from a little modulation. I&#39;m interested to see your version of UC for this style of face. Post soon? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jens... having not benefited from an eductaion in typography of any kind, your remarks at first were slightly confusing. But it doesn&#39;t take a genius to decipher most of what you say.  <BR>&#62;Look at the &#39;c&#39;, the width of the bowl is bigger than the bowl of the &#39;d&#39; <BR> <BR>yup, noticed that. have corrected. <BR>&#62;The horizontal stem of the &#39;f&#39; and &#39;t&#39; is to short in my opinion <BR> <BR>I was unduly influenced by a common newspaper font in England here. You are right. <BR> <BR>&#62;BTW: the angel of the &#39;t&#39; down-stroke <BR> <BR>Am I right in thinking you meant to say &#34;angle&#34;? <BR> <BR>anyway, will fix the &#39;m&#39; and &#39;n&#39;. I can see what you mean about the &#39;d&#39; in the gif, but in fontographer it seems OK. strange. <BR> <BR>anyway, here is the font so far.. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2879.gif" ALT="blit"> <BR> <BR>m still needs work, as does s</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hoppla angle yes you are right! Im sorry! I form germany... <BR> <BR>lets go on: :-&#41; <BR>&#39;m&#39; and &#39;s&#39; you saw by yourself... but look where the bowl meet the stem and compare/make it similar to the &#39;n&#39; &#40;the same to the &#39;r&#39;&#41;. The &#39;s&#39; seems to be mirrored. You can do this I guess but I would try to do something like this: <BR>&#40;simulation&#41; <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2884.gif" ALT="2xs.gif"> <BR> <BR>The width of &#39;v&#39;, &#39;x&#39; and &#39;z&#39; is to big, inverse the &#39;w&#39; is to small. <BR>Flavor: the middle stroke of the w maybe have to go up to the x-height <BR> <BR>The horizontal line of the &#39;e&#39; need improvement. Also the &#39;down&#39;bowl as not smooth <BR> <BR>BTW: Please dont care about the typography name I make, maybe they are wrong.. <BR> <BR>Greetings Jens <BR>BTW: wich university is it where you will go? And wich &#39;course&#39;?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> &#62; Cambridge University, doing Computer Science. <BR> <BR>Heavy. <BR> <BR>The font: my main problem is that many of the curves have &#34;wobbly&#34; contours; like in the bowl of the &#34;b&#34;, the top is heavy, the right way too light, and the bottom a little too light. Compare with the &#34;c&#34;, which is mostly solid, but much darker too. Also, make the &#34;m&#34; like the &#34;n&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>
