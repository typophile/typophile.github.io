  sites like myfonts and linotype etc... Does anyone know of any online or offline
  articles about Arthur Baker (of GlyphSystems.com) of about 1000 words? They can
  be about anything to do with the man, his life, his typefaces etc etc.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    a public library. For years, many people have found them useful for gathering
    information for homework assignments. You might want to try it.

  body: You are welcom, Mikaela. Not sure if you've tried larger University libraries
    online archives, but they should have access to other article databases as well.
    I can't remember the names, but I've used them myself and found them, as I recall,
    quite useful.

    Cynthia Batty (formerly Hollandsworth) has some connection to them I think - try
    asking her.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Mass. Maybe you could look him up in the phone directory and interview him by
    phone.\r\n\r\nHe has a short Bio on http://www.internationalhouseoffonts.com"

  body: Years ago, Arthur used to call me up from time-to-time and want to gossip
    about what was going on in the type business. If you do call him, I think you
    should be careful about mentioning Cynthia, he might give you a few stories too
    many.
