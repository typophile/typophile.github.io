body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been trying to figure out some things about digital type
  in the early and mid-nineties. I have licensed sets of fonts from URW (not URW++!)
  and Bitstream. Both these contain ITC fonts, for instance ITC Symbol and ITC New
  Baskerville. However, these fonts have several differences; For one the kerning
  differs and the accents are mostly different. Here is an example, ITC Symbol from
  Bitstream and URW.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCSymbol_4569.jpg]\r\n\r\nTop
  is the Bitstream version, bottom the URW version. If I compare these to the fonts
  now offered by ITC on MyFonts, it seems the URW version is closer, whereas the Bitstream
  version seems to have more generic accents for it\u2018s fonts. My question is what
  was licensed from ITC? It seems only the outlines are the same. \r\n\r\nAs far as
  I know URW and ITC used to work closely together in realising the ITC fonts, which
  were also sold by URW at the time. I don't know exactly what their collaboration
  amounted to, though I know they developed smallcaps fonts for several typefaces,
  including Mendoza and Symbol. When URW when bankrupt in 1994 the license agreement
  stopped, and seems to have gone to Elsner and Flake (former URW employees). This
  is why URW++ does not sell the ITC fonts anymore. Bitstream seemed to have a more
  straightforward licensing deal, which was ended when Monotype bought ITC.\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to have more info, or corrections, from those in the know.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "In the years of photo and then in the early part of digital (I'm taking about
    80s-early 90s), a lot of the ITC stuff was done at Mergenthaler-Linotype and later
    at Linotype-Hell (same company.. just merged with Hell Graphics). Mergenthaler
    took the supplied 'film strips' and 'film' letter forms, and adopted them to their
    grid (unit) system. Linotype felt they did a better job, because they examined
    all the 'control' characters throughout the family of weights, and made spacing
    and character proportion adjusted as necessary. The general consensus was that
    Mergenthaler did a very good, job. The joke on the inside was, why doesn't everybody
    just leave our stuff alone, like Mergenthaler, instead of changing things, when
    in fact, it was the other way around. And, we all know that Adobe came to Linotype
    for the Linotype version of all the fonts currently in use today. Or, I should
    say... most of them. There are always exceptions.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, URW
    licensed the fonts from Linotype, and as far as I know, should be the same. But
    then, Elsner & Flake negotiated a licensing agreement to distribute Linotype fonts.
    I think, they might of made changes. I cannot remember the specifics. Maybe others
    can shed more light on this.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, in the early/mid-80s,
    Bitstream (created by former Linotype employees) started to create digital versions
    of the 'Linotype Library' for Camex and Scitex. \r\n\r\nAn interesting previous
    thread about Bitstream...\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/904\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    Bitstream made many changes (improvements), because of the old Linotype antiquated
    (18) unit system, and added in their own accents. In some cases Bitstream went
    back to the original (well-known) designers and actually created a new digital
    version of the font family(s) with many aesthetic improvements.\r\n\r\nBut, because
    they could not get Linotype's blessing, they had to adopt their own font naming
    scheme. It was actually a very good typeface naming solution. Later on, Linotype
    negotiated a deal with Bitstream... and all the fonts are still around, different
    names and different flavors.\r\n\r\nThat's just about the extent of it. That's
    why all the differences.\r\n\r\nI hope this was helpful."
