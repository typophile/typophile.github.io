  years (yeah! pretty slow). What make it different (or try to), from other pixel
  fonts is make it have OpenType features, such as subscripts, superscripts, ligatures
  and, at least, have all European alphabet characters. If you want to have a go,
  drop me a line:\r\nfelipe [at] sugarcaned.com.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cosmeticbit-regular_4334.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cosmeticbit-bold_6651.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cosmetic-features_5298.gif]"

  body: "Pixelfonts are mainly used in Flash applications, and Flash does not support
    Opentype. That's a bummer. It looks nice, but there's not much to add to this
    genre (though the language support might be very useful to someone!). I'd rather
    go down the road of subpixel rendering and optical sizes for screen use \u2013\_which
    really is some sort of hinting when I come to think of it."

    but the bold is just wonderful.

  body: OpenType feature support should arrive in Flash shortly, if it's not already
    there through some new alpha release. I believe it is also already available in
    Silverlight, arguably a formidable alternative to Flash.
