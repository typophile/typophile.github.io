  but I cant find any license information  for it on the web \u2014 does anyone know
  where it might have come from/who the designer might be? \r\n\r\nIf nothing else,
  I would love to find a similar font that is available for commercial use. "

  body: "The copyright of a Booker font says:  \"1995 Solotech Design. All Rights
    Reserved.\"\r\nAccording to Luc Devroye info on Solotech:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-29677.html\r\n<blockquote>\"[...]
    some of their fonts (if not all) are exact unaltered copies of other people's
    fonts.\"</blockquote>\r\nTherefore I don't think the original font name was \"Booker\".\r\n\r\nThis
    is one of these fonts copied/sold by many forgery companies under different names
    and although I doubt any of them is the original design, I'll list them here to
