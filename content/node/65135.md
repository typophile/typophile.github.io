  from a photo seen in today's Heidelberg newspaper shows that the font for typesetting
  \"Pfizer\" was forged too.\r\n\r\nsee www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/viagra.jpg\r\n\r\n(to
  the left: original, to the right: forgery)\r\n\r\nBy the way: The word \"Viagra\"
  is a \"forgery\" of the Sanskrit word \"vyaghra\", which originally denoted \"he
  who smells scents by opening his jaws\" (Manfred Mayrhofer).\r\n"
