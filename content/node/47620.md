  body: As this poster tries to mimick vintage movie posters, I'd say this movie logo
    most probably is custom drawn.

  body: Have a look at the work of Douglas Annand. He did some pretty amazing work
    around the time that this poster is aping.

  body: The actors' and director's names indeed, but I thought Matt was specifically
    asking for the movie logo.

  body: "I think Yves is correct that AUSTRALIA is custom drawn. The closest I can
    suggest is Red Rooster's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/radiant/|Radiant
    Bold Extra Condensed]], which includes a symmetrical U as an alternate character.
    A tweak to the A and added quarter circle serifs would get you pretty close.\r\n\r\n-
