body: "I would most appreciate your opinions regarding my logo.\r\n\r\nThe client,
  IPiFony, specializes in the development of software that enables hosted VoIP telephony
  services.  Their customers, primarily, are regional ISP's.\r\n\r\nThe concept for
  the logo is a light bulb formed from exclamation marks, with a cable jack at its
  base.  The light bulb, obviously is a common symbol for a bright idea.  I realize
  that it's cliche, but I think it works here; it's simple and memorable, and that's
  often the best approach.  The exclamation marks suggest the urgency / sudden realization
  that is an epiphany; furthermore, there are eight of them, which references the
  number of wires in a CAT5 cable (which is used to connect the phones to the network).
  \ The logotype is Mink (from T26) with numerous customizations.  I believe it strikes
  the right balance between casual and formal, and appears sufficiently modern without
  looking trendy.  For the \"i\" characters, I used inverted exclamation marks to
  establish visual continuity with the icon.  The colors are Pantone Violet and Pantone
  122.\r\n\r\nNOW, the dilemma...\r\n\r\nI have two versions where the only difference
  is the appearance of the \"y\".  The client prefers the first.  I prefer the second.
  \ I believe the crook in the \"y\" is distracting, and leads the eye back toward
  the beginning of the type rather than continuing naturally to the icon.  I like
  the consistency achieved in the second version by echoing the vertical descender
  of the \"p\" and \"f\".\r\n\r\nPlease comment.  I'd really like additional perspectives
  before I revisit this issue with the client.  I really think I'm right about this,
  but I welcome your opinions whether you agree or disagree.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/critique_5269.gif]"

  body: "Is it supposed to be pronounced 'epiphany'? If so, then this works. As for
    the y, the second seems a little more consistent with the rest of the letterforms.\r\n\r\nRemember,
    never show the clients the versions YOU don't like. ;o)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like that you've given so much thought to the symbolism in the logo art.
    My only worry would be that the purple lines radiating from the light bulb may
    look a bit elementary or cartoony. And I didn't see them as marks until I read
    your description.\r\nAnother solution may be to use an exclamation mark (an inverted
    i here) as the filament in the light bulb, bringing the art in closer to the type
    and raising it in a superscript-ish fashion to communicate the \"exclamation\"
    of sudden insight.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the attractiveness of the artwork should
    never be sacrificed for the sake of a good idea.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ipifony_3445.jpg]"

  body: I like the second one - without the crook in the 'y'. I agree that it is distracting
    and I am drawn to look at this too. Maybe try this without the crook in the 'y'.
    With just a curved descender.

    this to the join in the 'p'. They should look the same.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    definitely better unless you were to take out that weird mass at the bottom of
    the first and make the descender straight. '

  body: I like the 1st one at the top but without the purple lines. The bulb says
    enough to me but is it an electric company or a telephone service? Hmm...the bulb
    suggests light, idea, electricity to me.

  body: "The f's long descender emphasizes the \"fony\" for me, making it a company
    I'd be hesitant to trust.  Is that just me?\r\n\r\nI think making the y into a
    lightbulb would deemphasize that."
