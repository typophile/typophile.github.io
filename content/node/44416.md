  being the best rock album of all times (don\u2019t argue!). Since he is an electronics
  engineer I had this idea for a T-shirt for him. But - it doesn\u2019t seem to work
  out. Top has the tightness of the original but the L isn\u2019t legible very well.
  Bottom: L is OK, but is it still AC/DC enough (too loose, L punches a hole)?\r\nWhat
  do you think? Is it just a nice idea but doesn\u2019t work out?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LA-RS_TP_4482.jpg]"

    not the bottom of the first and the top of the second?\r\nI think you can tighten
    the spacing overall too."

    that the spacing of the whole thing is much tighter in the original."

  body: I agree with Kevin on the Cars thing. What about the "bling" spots and zeroing
    the kerning on the bolt?  I guess you already noticed that and decided it looks
    better this way .

    Huerta</a>...\r\n\r\nSee also this older thread: http://www.typophile.com/node/20336\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I don't want to start an argument either, but I am high-fiving Miss Tiffany across
    cyberspace for mentioning Led Zeppelin! :-)\r\n\r\nYou rock, Tiffany!"

  body: "Hmm...\r\n\r\nI think the bottom one is probably better than Eben's sketches
    (but I would still try it out though) - I just have a feeling the L will have
    too much of an arabic feel compared to the other letters if you go in that direction.\r\n\r\nNot
    getting involved in an argument either but Miss Tiffany and Ricardo are absolutely
    right about Zeppelin (eventhough that statement is gonna cost me a couple of friends
    down under;-)\r\n\r\nPs: Don't get me wrong ACDC is up there!-)\r\n"
