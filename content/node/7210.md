  work by Nicolas Jenson. Where do the revivalists get their samples? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  also looking for old magazines and pulp fiction in the public domain, especially
  British, French and German. Are there any good resources on the web?

    It&#39;s not highly difficult to get to handle some of those old gems &#40;try
    a good university&#41;, but getting permission to squish them down or expose them
    to strong light is another matter. Maybe if you had a really good macro photography
    setup that could work in low light, you might get somebody somewhere to OK it.
    The big-name &#34;revivalists&#34; often have important friends, or they might
    work directly from the punches or matrices. <BR> <BR>But Octavo is indeed one
    good way to get at that type of stuff. Good facsimiles are another, but they do
    have to be good enough. You might also find enlargements of snippets of text here
    and there, like in that Gaskell article: &#34;Photographic Enlargements of Type
    Forms&#34; in the Journal of the Printing Historical Society, #7, 1971, pp 51-53.

  body: Fortunately, I don&#39;t need punches, just images of his prints. <BR> <BR>Before
    I actually design anything, I want to go through the motions in FontLab with a
    variant of an existing typeface. I saw an enlargement of some Roman type by Jenson
    in &#39;The Elements of Typographic Style,&#39; by Robert Bringhurst, and realized
    it would be a lot of fun to make an &#34;antique&#34; variant of it, complete
    with alternates. A good starter project. I might even degrade the quality further
    and make an &#34;ancient&#34; style face. Much as I adore Caslon Antique, I think
    it misses some of the flavor I see in this Jenson sample. <BR> <BR>Thanks for
    all the suggestions! Octavo.com already has me drooling...

  body: You could always research at different special collection libraries. Most
    libraries have the availability of photography and photocopying available. For
    instance, the <a href="http://sc.lib.byu.edu/" target="_blank">L. Tom Perry Special
    Collections</a> has an amazing collection of books from the incunable period and
    beyond.
