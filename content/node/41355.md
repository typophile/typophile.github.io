  about the development of the \xABBrauer\xBB typeface, its originator\r\nPierre Miedinger
  (a nephew of the designer of Helvetica, the legendary Max Miedinger) cryptically
  said: \xABAs we all know, beer contains alcohol, an intoxicant with all its known
  side effects, it blurs the vision and obliterates any sharp edges. That\u2019s why
  we continuously squinted when checking the shapes of the developing letters while
  drawing the typeface. The resulting negative drawing of the font is both sharp and
  rounded - as if you didn\u2019t have clear vision anymore.\xBB\r\n\r\nToday, we
  can only guess what role the actual consumption of H\xFCrlimann Sternbr\xE4u played
  in the genesis of the typeface in the mid-seventies.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the
  H\xFCrlimann brewery has been bought up by Carlsberg and the typeface was discarded
  many years ago. The beautiful factory buildings were recently transformed into a
  complex of offices, shops and restaurants; Google will soon open their largest offices
  outside the US on exactly the premises where the \xABBrauer\xBB font found its first
  modest manifestations.\r\n\r\nDesigners Marco Walser of Elektrosmog and Philippe
  Desarzens very soberly went about the task of further developing Miedinger\x1D\x1D\u2019s
  alcoholically challenged Helvetica variant into a full family of six weights. LL
  Brauer Neue, as it is now called, features a Regular, a Bold, and a Black cut, all
  with matching Italics. The Black cut replaces the existing version of \xABBrauer\xBB
  which has been available from Lineto since 1999.\r\n\r\nWith its new weights and
  italics forming a comprehensive family of fonts, LL Brauer Neue is now ready for
  much wider use \u2013 going well beyond its previous status as a headline font,
  something many customers have continuously been asking for.\r\n\r\nWe raise our
  glass to Messrs Miedinger, Walser and Desarzens whose fonts promise to reach the
  parts other fonts cannot reach!"
