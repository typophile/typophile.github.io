  be?\r\n\r\nNormally when I design, I copy and paste content from my client's ms
  word doc that they typed on their PC into my design projects on my mac. Or, I flow
  it in. This works perfect.\r\n\r\nNow, I need to copy content that is traditional
  Chinese typed on PCs  and paste it into my projects (inDesign or ms word) on my
  mac. I do not speak or read Chinese.\r\n\r\nI have lots of adobe and other fonts,
  but I believe I need the Chinese equivalent of Times New Roman or Arial that would
  be come standard on PCs sold to Chinese people."

  body: In theory your OS and apps should ship with fonts to cover these requirements.
    Are you encountering problems when you paste the text?

  body: "The OS comes with fonts;  the problem is to choose. For the fonts on the
    Mac, here is a list on Yales' site http://www.yale.edu/chinesemac/pages/osx7.html#fonts\r\n\r\nThe
    extesions TC means traditional Chinese and so I guess that Heiti TC would be suitable
    (I am no expert). I also understand from the list of characters sets http://www.yale.edu/chinesemac/pages/character_sets.html
    that Big-5 corresponds to Traditional Chineses and thus LiHei \u5137\u9ED1 Pro
    and LiSong \u5137\u5B8B Pro as well as Apple LiGothic, Apple LiSung, and BiauKai
    should fit the bill but I would double check."

  body: "Here is what I found in the mac fallback file DefaultFontFallbacks.plist
    (comments from 10.6 and 10.7; the 10.8 file is a binary):\r\n\r\nsans-serif:  \"for
    Traditional Chinese, use STHeiti TC\"\r\nserif:       \"for Traditional Chinese,
    use LiSong Pro\" \r\ncursive:     \"for Traditional Chinese, use BiauKai\"\r\n\r\nThose
    appear to be the default choices when Traditional Chinese is put before Korean,
    Japanese and Simplified Chinese in the System Preferences, Language & Text (I
    checked in Safari and TextEdit)\r\n\r\nThere is also another file, NSFontFallbacks.plist,
    with the following entries (PostScript names) for Traditional Chinese:\r\n\r\nsans-serif:
    \ LiHeiPro\r\nserif:       LiSongPro\r\n\r\n"
