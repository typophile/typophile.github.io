  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Not being a professional type designer or typographer myself, it is possible that my tastes require educating.</p>
<p>From time to time, I&rsquo;ve looked through various specimen books of typefaces in search of the typeface which most perfectly, in my mind, fulfills the &ldquo;crystal goblet&rdquo; dictum of Beatrice Warde. Garamond, Caslon, Caledonia, Times Roman, and even Century Expanded are all quite nice typefaces, but each of them has an individual personality that does call attention to itself to some extent.</p>
<p>Instead, I found that newspaper faces like Corona an Aurora (but not, say, Ionic No. 5) seemed, if not for their tiny descenders and large x-height, to embody the &ldquo;average&rdquo; forms of the letters that readers expect - particularly in the part of the lowercase letters that lies within the x-height area.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve finally found the regular book faces which embody the same basic design that I like in Corona and Aurora.</p>
<p>Bell, Roman No. 1, and Oxford are those faces.</p>
<p>But there are objections to those faces for general use. Especially in Bell, but still present to a lesser extent in Oxford, the digits have a peculiar form, the 2 especially being curly and slanted.</p>
<p>But there is something else, too. Perhaps I&rsquo;m imagining it (hence the title of this post). It looks like those faces are&hellip; distressed. Not to the extent of Fifteenth Century (aka &ldquo;Caslon Antique&rdquo;) - and distressed may not be the right word. Instead of the face being made to look like the type is beat-up, it is just that the shapes are made less regular and uniform, to give a punch-cut appearance rather than a pantographic appearance to the face.</p>
<p>Today, to the general reader who is not of refined typographic tastes, this, if present, would indeed be a fatal objection to widespread general use of a face, and even more so to its &ldquo;invisibility&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>According to recent research, people find that an averaged (blended) image of two faces is more attractive than either of them.
IIRC, Adrian Frutiger was interested in this effect of merging images.</p>
<p>It may be that what, in your own mind, you find most closely corresponds to neutrality, is the average of what you are familiar with.
So if you are looking to appeal to the taste of the general reader, it would be the average of what they are exposed to.</p>
<p>But I wonder how change comes about. Perhaps it is because the average also takes into account the percentage of the population who are &ldquo;prosumers&rdquo;, i.e. those of &ldquo;refined&rdquo; taste, who carry more clout than the bottom end (semi-illiterates).</p>
<p>And bear in mind that those of refined taste (art directors, graphic designers, typographers) are pushing the issue, putting non-neutral trendy types into the mix that is seen, and averaged, by the general reader.</p>
<p>Technology, also, changes the mix &ndash; I suspect there is a connection between the recent (last 20 years) retreat of serifed faces and the emergence of low-res reading devices.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bell was recut by Monotype as a revival, and essentially a facsimile, of an 18th-century letter. Thus the irregularities that you perceive. I believe the digital version also seeks to retain this characteristic.</p>
<p>Oxford and Roman No. 1 (by which I take you to mean the Binny Pica Roman No. 1) are the same face. But I&rsquo;m not sure what versions you are viewing. Oxford was a name later given to the Binny Pica Roman — again, a late 18th-century face: punchcut, warts and all.</p>
<p>Linotype cut Monticello as a revival of Binny/Oxford. And retaining the irregularities and inconsistencies was a <em>sine qua non</em> for Griffith and Conkwright in doing so.</p>
<p>Matthew Carter&rsquo;s digital update of Monticello, likewise, continues to preserve these characteristics.</p>
<p>Corona, on the other hand, was made unto itself, not a revival. It was, in fact, a culmination of the exploration of a certain hard-news style. As a result of the production environment it was destined for, all “irregularity” was necessarily boiled out of the design. Same goes for Aurora, Imperial, Ideal, et al.</p>
<p>As Nick points out, “average forms of letters that reader’s expect” is something of a moving target.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@kentlew:
I should indeed have made my point clear.</p>
<p>My first question, which was obvious and less implicit, has been answered: Bell and Oxford are indeed intentionally made to look punchcut instead of pantographed.</p>
<p>My other questions should have been stated explicitly, and then my point would have been clear.</p>
<p>The next question was: am I mistaken in thinking that Corona does have something in common with Bell - while the two faces are different in their purpose, and their x-height, is there indeed an important quality which they share? (What I think I admire about the two faces is the proportions and shapes of the lowercase letters - ignoring ascender and descender height, which can be changed easily enough.)</p>
<p>And, if that question is answered to the effect that the two faces do have something in common, what other faces share that? (One answer might be, I suspect, the wider and heavier Scotch Romans of the early 19th Century, as opposed to the narrow and lighter ones that came later, which, to me at least, gave Scotch Roman a bad name.)</p>
<p>In this connection, I will further note that I have the good fortune to own a copy of the Blue Ribbon Books edition (not the first edition, but a less-expensive reprint) of Secret and Urgent by Fletcher Pratt.</p>
<p>I had assumed the book was perhaps typeset in Century Expanded, but that is not the case. Its typeface comes very close to my ideal of an &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; typeface - to someone who grew up when Century Expanded, Baskerville, Caledonia, and Garamond were in wide use for publishing, but Times Roman was still a novelty; a particularly beautiful face, but one that called attention to itself by being a bit too gorgeous and too modern.</p>
<p>But it had one defect - the letter H, in small capitals, was clearly wider than it should have been. This allowed me to at least tentatively identify the face - as the Linotype face known by the name &ldquo;Number Twenty-One&rdquo;, thanks to &ldquo;The Type Specimen Book&rdquo; of V &amp; M Typographical.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I suppose this is rambling, but I sort of object to the notion that revivals are irregular only because the originals were. &ldquo;Object&rdquo; in that it doesn&rsquo;t address why the originals were irregular &ndash; the implication being they either didn&rsquo;t know better, didn&rsquo;t have the skill, or didn&rsquo;t have the technology.</p>
<p>Any aesthetic, whether in pure art &ndash; a piece of music, a painting, or in the design of a more practical object &ndash; a car, a typeface, falls between complete order and chaos. Complete order is boring, chaos not understandable. It is easy to avoid chaos. Boredom, on the other hand. . .</p>
<p>Perhaps the 18th and 19th century type designers understood that better?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I haven&rsquo;t forgotten how Donald Knuth found it necessary to make a travesty of mathematics.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a reference to the lecture which introduced TeX and METAFONT to the world; he showed how different values for a &lsquo;randomness&rsquo; factor would affect the appearance of type - which he illustrated with the word &ldquo;mathematics&rdquo;. And then he joked that he had one more thing to say - partly because he did not want people to be able to accuse him of ending his lecture by making a travesty of mathematics!</p>
<p>Having a bit of irregularity in a typeface, then, can of course be seen as making it warmer, more natural, and organic.</p>
<p>However, as my goal is an &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; typeface in the crystal goblet sense, and as irregularity had <strong>very definitely</strong> fallen out of fashion, as opposed to pantographic perfection, in the period of time (1950-1965) relative to which I am seeking to find or create a nondescript typeface, while some design elements of Bell might be useful to its quest, sadly though it may be, its irregularity definitely is <strong>not</strong>: that would be noticeable and jarring to the reader, not &ldquo;invisible&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Bell was irregular because they couldn&rsquo;t do any better - after all, Baskerville already existed - or, on the other hand, that Century Expanded was free of irregularity because they had meretricious tastes over at ATF. Mechanical perfection does demand quality craftsmanship, and is legitimately appealing to the eye in appropriate contexts - and the printing of the 20th century largely was such a context.</p>
<p>In that connection, I can still remember the visual impact of a book set in Times Roman back in the days when that was a rarity (i.e. the first edition of <em>The Codebreakers</em> by David Kahn) and before the face became ubiquitous. A return to a somewhat older style of face might give the eyes a rest, and let Times get some of its mojo back.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Charles — I certainly didn’t mean to imply that the revivals cited above were irregular solely because the originals were. I’m sure there was more consideration than that. And I certainly don’t hold that the earlier punchcutters didn’t know better or didn’t have the skill. (At least not those from the period in question here.)</p>
<p>In the case of Monticello, Griffith himself stated his explicit intention to preserve the irregularity of Binny’s original in several instances. Here is one example from an article for the <cite>AIGA Journal,</cite> ca. late 1950s, which I think you will appreciate:</p>
<p>“The serif treatment of the lower-case is unusually interesting, and is in my opinion largely responsible for the pleasant and spirited movement of the face under continuous reading. The keen eye will perceive that no two serifs in the lower-case alphabet are exactly alike, a remarkable achievement of a gifted type-cutter.”</p>
<p>So, CHG recognized the truth of your statements.</p>

<p>Well, if we’re talking purely about perception, who am I to say that you aren’t perceiving an important shared quality? I don’t know that I see exactly the same kinship that you do, but let’s all take a look:</p>
<p>First is 8 pt. Corona from a Linotype specimen book. Following that, Bell from Morison’s <cite>Tally of Types</cite> (presumably 12 pt.) These illustrations are not to scale. I made a effort to roughly match x-heights.</p>
