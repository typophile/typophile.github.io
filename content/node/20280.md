  \r\nI've been messing about in ResEdit without getting any satisfactory results
  (I still could erase the new icon in the info window). I've gone through ResEdit's
  manual, but found no answer to my question.\r\n\r\nOr is there a better (easier)
  application to do that in the first place?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSteph"

    thought that on MacOS you could even just copy-paste\r\nan image (if it's the
    right size) from the clipboard.\r\n\r\nIf it's not working it might be because
    fonts are considered\r\nsystem files, the and OS imposes an icon that it wants?\r\n\r\nA
    tangential question:\r\nAre you using ResEdit in OSX? I didn't think that was
    possible.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "No, I'm using ResEdit in OS9. But if you just paste the image into the
      info window, you can still erase it in order to see the original one. But what
      I'm looking for, is to embed the icon into the icon resource, so that no one
      could erase it (e.g. FF-fonts). And I haven't succeeded up to now.\r\n\r\nBut
      funny thing is, in OS9 all the original icons are preserved, while most of them
      are ripped off in OSX mode. So now I wonder what's the point doing this at all?

  body: "i've used a photoshop plug-in called <a href=\"http://www.iconfactory.com/iconbuilder.asp\">Icon
    Builder</a> to create [directory/folder] icons.\r\n\r\nfollow the steps to create
    the icon at the various required sizes, then actually copy and paste the very
    small graphics at the top of the \"get info\" windows.\r\n\r\nthere are a few
    ways to do it, but using a program like Icon Builder allows you to preserve the
    transparancy so your shape doesn't have to be rectangular.\r\n\r\nhope this helps\u2026\r\n------"

    download the program for free, but I can't remember which site I got it from.
    You can then just copy/paste like hrant said."
