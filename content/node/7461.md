  and i&#39;m experiencing a little problem. <BR> <BR>i&#39;m using fontlab. every
  time i generate the font and view it in say, illustrator, the period after the lower
  case &#39;y&#39; moves itself before the &#39;y&#39;. something like this: &#34;honorar.y&#34;
  <BR> <BR>any ideas why this is happening?'

  body: I have had somewhat the same problem with different letters though. I am guessing
    that you have autospaced and autokerned the font. That is what I did and weird
    things started happening. Certain letter pairs were kerned as much as -1000. <BR>I
    had to go back and change the values manually in Fontlab&#39;s kerning dialog
    to get this straightened out. <BR> <BR>Check the kerning values for the glyph
    pair &#34;y.&#34; <BR> <BR>Magnus
