body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI work as an in-house designer, and I'm trying to standardize
  our font library. There are many fonts that have multiple weights and widths that
  show up individually as families, instead of all in one family with the weights/widths
  as styles.\r\n\r\nI've read the guide from the now-offline FontLab group on MSN,
  but I don't like the end result. It works fine in Adobe Illustrator, but in font
  management programs (I'm using FontExpert) the subcategories (FontName Med Cnd)
  show up in the lists, instead of only the family name. I would already have given
  up, but I've seen a font that has 7 different weights (exceeding Windows' limit
  of 4) plus an italic for each that showed up as one family in both Illustrator and
  FontExpert. I've been able to replicate this partially, but won't work when you
  add in the variable of condensed/compressed fonts.\r\n\r\nI did a test to see how
  the data in the FontLab font info fields is interpreted by both Illustrator and
  FontExpert, and was a little surprised. I put the name of the field into each field.
  (Family Name: FamilyName, Style Name: StyleName, etc.) In FontExpert, only the FamilyName
  showed up, but in Illustrator, I found the font under FullName, with the default
  style being OTStyleName. (from the open-type specific page) However, when I opened
  FontLab up again, and looked at the fields, Menu Name wasn't MenuName anymore, it
  had been switched to FamilyName. I tried to change it back, and it wouldn't stick.
  Also, after clearing all the open-type specific fields, the Style Name showed up
  as StyleName in Illustrator, as expected.\r\n\r\nSo my head hurts from thinking
  about all of this. I thought I'd check with you experts to see if it can be done
  before giving up and dealing with multiple families in font management."

  body: "Theoretically you can do what you want with OpenType naming <em>if</em> all
    fonts have the same OpenType Family Name and you make the weights part of the
    style name. That doesn\u2019t mean software is going to play well with your OCD
    font naming system because it\u2019s not how sane people do it and software tends
    to expect naming to be rather conventional.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you just do
    not do this. Font naming can get really ugly when it doesn\u2019t work well, and
    there are good reasons for font designers breaking the widths up into their own
    families. It\u2019s also going to be a real problem if you ever need to do work
    with outside designers as almost no font license allows you to distribute modified
    fonts to users outside of your organization."
