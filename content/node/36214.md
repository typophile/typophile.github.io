    them himself. THey include Chica, Gangly, Ingenius and Serifedsans.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a thread on the subject.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/18055"

  body: He designed one typeface that was offered at GarageFonts only for a very short
    time. He used fonts and lettering from a variety of designers, including Rodney
    Shelden Fehsenfeld, Miles Newlyn (who hangs out here) and Nancy Mazzei. If you're
    seeking Raygun-era fonts, go to http://www.garagefonts.com and have a look around.

    and I see it moved my post out of order. Boo.

  body: "If I recall correctly, a number of proprietary designs and customized versions
    of existing typefaces that Carson used got unleashed into the underground due
    to a stolen computer. Patty, I'd be interested to know how you came by your set
    of \"David Carson\" fonts. A lot of people have these fonts on their hard drives
    but don't know/remember where they came from. Some of them are actually available
    on the market as retail types now, through various foundries (for instance, Gangly
    is at Font Bureau).\r\n\r\n*Edit to put post in proper order*\r\n"

  body: Tamye - I got the fonts from a friend, about 5 years ago. No idea where this
    friend got them. Unlicensed, obviously.
