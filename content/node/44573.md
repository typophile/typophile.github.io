  (pdf)]] arrived through my door this morning. After reading the posts about the
  American Presidential elections and their design, I was a bit stunned about how
  bad all of these are. For instance, why didn't they justify the text (set in tight
  columns) on Left List candidate's page; why did Si\xE2n Berry's team choice a typeface
  with such an ugly \xE2; and why are there so many letter collisions on Matt O'Connor's
  page (this seems to be less obvious with the PDF)? I'm also a bit surprised that
  Brian Paddick chose UKIP's colours (purple and yellow) for his campaign, but I suppose
  that would be less noticeable if they were not on adjacent pages. The most scary
  thing, however, is that picture of Ken Livingstone. In print, it looks like it was
  taken with a fish-eye lens!\r\n\r\nConsidering the amount the main candidates are
  spending, you would have though that they could have done better!\r\n\r\n-Jacob

    simple copy in word and photocopy it on Astrobrites. This crazy brochure made
    me contemplate cutting my eyeballs out with my bone folder.

    entertaining piece of post I've received in a long time. I thought more or less
    everything you thought, though I take no issue with Ken's portrait, which I think
    is better than all the others bar Si&acirc;n's. I'm amazed by the Lib Dems to
    the extent that I feel like writing to them. A lot of them seem to have opted
    for purple. I wonder why?\r\n\r\nAnd the Conservatives have snuck through a re-brand
    without my noticing before. A green scribbly tree replaces the Tory torch. A green
    Tory tree? What horseshit!\r\n\r\nWhat's worse is the barly shrouded racism in
    the content of the BNP, UKIP and the anti-mosque Christian Choice candidate. In
    all what a terrible advert for London. The fact they mailed the entire electoral
    register with this booklet is pretty poor too. There are three voters in my house.
    One appallingly designed leaflet between us would have done."

    they do ours. If mainstream American parties sent this kind of stuff out in New
    York City it would light a fire under the ass of every politico around the globe. "

    quite liked the style and the design and the font.\r\n\r\nThen came page three.
    Oh dear. The colours. The Arial. The Times New bloody Roman.\r\n\r\nI rather liked
    the Conservative one, it\u2019s clean and unobtrusive. The Liberal Democrats\u2019
    designer should be defenestrated. The Christian Choice one first made me cringe
    at the disgusting purple gradient background; then I guffawed mirthfully at the
    expression on the kid\u2019s face; and then I wondered what kind of Christian
    politician chooses to boldly parade the fact that he\u2019s old enough to be his
    wife\u2019s father. And Ken Livingstone just looks creepy. No, I don\u2019t want
    a lollipop.\r\n\r\nAh, thank God. Back to proper design with typographic hierarchies,
    relatively acceptable colour schemes, and overall lack of choroidal incinerations.\r\n\r\nI
    like my \u201CJunk mail\u2014no thanks!\u201D sign."

    over. I believe it is supposed to be an English (or should that be British?) oak.
    I seem to remember that they were toying with a less scribbled one for a while,
    which looked a lot a better than the current one. Incidentally, has anyone else
    noticed how small the Labour logo is on Ken's page?\r\n\r\nThe problem with the
    Tory one is that is looks rubbish in print. The leaflet is published in a booklet
    with each candidate's page folded in half so the important information really
    needs to be on the left page for maximum effect. Scanning through it, I missed
    all of his policies. I get the impression they only printed it onto flat A4 and
    didn't think of it as a page in a booklet.\r\n\r\n-Jacob"
