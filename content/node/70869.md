  that ever since I upgraded to Snow Leopard from Leopard, I have been unable to get
  certain ligatures to display, such as the 'ct' ligature.   \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  what the problem might be and if there is a workaround solution? \r\n\r\nThx! "

    ligatures ...

    system fonts slightly different now. Also is it the same version of MS word that
    you were using pre-snow leopard? '

    know about newer versions, but MS Word 2008 ignores it insistently. "

    OpenType ligatures (assuming they have been turned on for your document), but
    only common ones like fi, fl, ffi and not st or ct."

    as far as I know. Linux Libertine does have both ct and st, but you won\u2019t
    get to use it with MS Office. \r\n\r\nThis is the type fad in all it\u2019s glory:
    more ligatures, for less money."
