  body: Yves - thank you for your time &amp; effort. Yes, that&#39;s the best sample
    I have so I will have a good look at Alexon. This site is a great resource and
    I will no doubt have plenty more font ID&#39;s to post. BTW your pic looks a bit
    like Bon Scott to me! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
