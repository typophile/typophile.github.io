  one of the best. It's called [[baseline magazine|baseline]] (http://www.baselinemagazine.com/)
  and for \xA348 for a quarterly magazine it beats pretty much any other I have come
  across so far. What I'm after are recommendations for other typesetting/typography
  journals/magazines. I don't actually know anyone else in person who gets the same
  enjoyment out of typography as I do and it's not really the sort of thing which
  I can talk about down at the pub with my mates! so any pointers are gratefully received!\r\n"

  body: "I subscribed to Baseline from issues 20 to 37, and even paid a bundle for
    all their back issues (back to #11). Then I bought the elusive #10 on eBay. In
    the end though, I realized that the amount of type design (as opposed to typography,
    which is broader, less focused) content for the price was too low, and frankly
    getting lower. And realizing that my collection had become worth as much as it
    ever would, I sold the bundle on eBay (for a decent, not stellar price). These
    days I read two others: [[typo magazine|TYPO]], and [[tipoGrafica]]. Plus the
    occasional \"special type issue\" of things like Eye, although I've massively
    cut down on my physical browsing time lately.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Ack. Hrant, thank you for mentioning those two. If you read Portuguese then
    look for Tupigraphia as well.

  body: "I have ALL the Baselines -- going back to the time it was Letrasets house
    mag. But come to think of it; I have never reread a single issue.\r\nEye is a
    lot broader in its appeal, though the last issues are too off beat for my taste.\r\nTYPO
    is great. I subscribed two issues ago and downloaded the rest. Makes for interesting
    reading (Preissig!). \r\n[[DotDotDot]] is a nice addition to the list..."

  body: "Also if you have a spare GBP 275 lying around you could buy the Octavo, journal
    of typography box set . \r\n\r\n\"Limited edition, numbered, boxed set from an
    edition of 225. Contains 7 printed issues and an interactive CD-rom. Wide-ranging
    articles discuss typography in design, the visual arts, architecture and the environment.
    The first typography journal to practice what it preaches, its eight issues are
    a typographic journey from three-column grid to interactive CD-rom. Pre-Mac typographic
    experimentation at the limits of photo-typesetting, repro and print technology.
    Innovative, intelligent and influential. Challenging the narrow dogma of then
    traditional theory and commercial acceptability. Typography in Britain would never
    be the same again.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.markholtdesign.com/\r\n\r\n"

      our university on the InfoDesign pathway...\r\n\r\nhad a great type workshop
      with him using photocopiers and scissors. and a chance to look through some
      of the editions of their journal; very impressive stuff. he didn't leave the
      box with us for long though, i don't blame him!"
