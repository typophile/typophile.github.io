  at Cooper Union.\r\n\r\nI have been taking private classes with Hannes Famira, and
  it has been hugely beneficial to my development as a type designer.\r\n\r\nI went
  from barely clunking around in FontLab to producing a type family which was accepted
  by FontShop and Village, the latter of whom I will distributing with.\r\n\r\nI recommend
  it to anyone in the New York area who is serious about type.\r\n\r\nYou can register
  for his class here: http://www.cooper.edu/ce/calligph.html#p105\r\n\r\nAnd learn
  more about Hannes and his teaching philosophy here: http://www.typedu.org\r\n\r\nJeremy"

  body: Hey, Jeremy! Thanks for the info -- I believe Hannes also taught this class
    in 2006, at least according to this <a href="http://typographica.org/001056.php"><strong>Typographica
