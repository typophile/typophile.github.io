body: "Most of the time Gmail lets me insert whatever characters I want into the subject
  or body of an email, but about a quarter of the time, it simply refuses to accept
  en or em dashes, and I have to revert to hyphens. It's so annoying, and it seems
  to do this at random.\r\n\r\nThis has been bugging me for ages, and I figured some
  other typophile here must have run into the same thing.\r\n\r\nOther deets: It doesn't
  matter whether I'm in plain vs. rich text mode, or replying vs. composing anew.
  I don't know if it also would prevent me from inserting other nonstandard glyphs,
  but I'm guessing it would. (I tried to check just now, but it's not doing it right
  now.) I'm on a Mac, using Firefox. I tried finding an answer via google, but no
  luck."

  body: I can't reproduce it, works ok for me. I wish I had a mac to try to figure
    it out. In windows you can manually type alt+0151 but on a mac it looks like you
    do these via an onscreen keyboard... or do you? How do you usually enter it?

  body: "Don't you just love troubleshooting glitches that seem to happen completely
    at random? The first thing that comes to mind is that Gmail uses shortcut access
    keys (and a metric ton of javascript), but that alone isn't much to hint at the
    problem.\r\n\r\nWhich methods have you tried using to enter the characters \u2014
    Option key shortcuts, character palette, copy/paste from another app? When the
    bug occurs, have you tested to make sure that those characters work elsewhere
    in Firefox? Does restarting have any effect? Are you using any extensions or user
    scripts related to Gmail, or that might affect key bindings? "

  body: "Hi guys \u2013\r\n\r\nThanks for the ideas, I'm waiting until it next happens
    to test them... \r\n\r\n(I'm using option shortcuts, very few extensions, and
    it doesn't seem to affect any other part of Firefox, but I'll double check next
    time it happens. I'll also try restarting, but considering how many tabs I keep
    open, I hope I can figure out a better solution.)\r\n\r\nZach"

title: Annoying Gmail bug, anyone else notice it? It won't let me type en/em dashes.
