  body: "EDITED:\r\nA true mystery. The usually reliable reference for the source
    of Nick's Fonts http://home.kpn.nl/savoogt1963/FontSources.htm states that the
    lowercase of Xanthippe is unknown.\r\nSome variant of a \"titling text\" by a
    19th century foundry. But which one?\r\nSince writing this I checked and found
    some similar fonts but nothing spot on.\r\nI wonder where Nick saw the font with
    the lower case. \r\nDon"

title: It looks like Engravers Old English but The E and C are different. C has two
  extra lines on it. Trying to figure out what font this is.
