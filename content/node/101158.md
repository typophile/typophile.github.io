  of nice pictures that you could buy to use for presenting for an example an corporate
  identity. There where everything from white boxes to stacks of business cards etc,
  that you could add your design on to. It was proper photos rather that the generic
  vector stuff you find on shutterstock etc.\r\n\r\nAnyone? \r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n//C\r\n

    photo sites. For example, at iStockPhoto.com if I search for \"business cards
    blank\" I find numerous images similar to this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stock-illustration-22964126-business-cards-templates_3561.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
    you've got Photoshop you can easily take a business card mockup and apply it to
    the stock photo . Open the stock photo, then in a new layer add your card mockup,
    and then distort your card mockup to fit the photo's perspective by selecting
    the mockup and then Edit > Transform > Distort and drag the mockup's corners until
    they align with the card in the stock photo."
