body: I realize this is a new font, but I was wondering if there was anything out
  there that is similar to it.  The closest I could find was <a href="http://www.paratype.com/ustore/fonts/URW-Quint.htm">Quint</a>

  body: "I recently compiled a list of humanist slab serifs, the category into I would
    put Soho except that I see it as more cold and mechanical (\"modern\"?). Here
    goes (all fonts available on MyFonts.com unless otherwise listed):\r\n\r\nSilica
    (Stonetypefoundry.com)\r\nPMN Caecilia\r\nEnclave (Terminaldesign.com)\r\nChaparral\r\nTheSerif
    (Lucasfonts.com)\r\nITC Officina Serif\r\nAmasis\r\nFF Olsen\r\nPlacebo Serif\r\nAptifer
    Slab\r\n\r\nEDIT: And how could I have forgotten Stag from Vllg.com?"
