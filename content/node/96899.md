body: "I want a font that is legible like print, but elegant as cursive. The cursive
  fonts connect the letters too much and make it difficult to read. And the print
  fonts are all to boring. I would like a font that has a mix between cursive and
  print so that tails of the letters are only slightly connected, but are still readable.
