body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI am turning to you all as my typophile saviors on this
  one.  A former employee created an address sign's artwork (for our studio).  As
  the years have gone by, files were lost, fonts deleted.  Time has come to remake
  it.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on what this might be?  The \"1\" is similar to Century
  Gothic Bold, but the 2 differs to some degree.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chadwick_addressSign_sm_6143.jpg]\r\n\r\nANY
  help would be great!!!\r\n\r\nBest\r\nDaniel"
