  have identified the bold typeface that reads \"EPCON\" to be Bazar, but I am having
  trouble identifying the typeface that reads \"Year One,\" along with the low-waisted
  typeface that reads \"September,\" as well as the information that has been written
  on the flyer.\r\n\r\nI have tried contacting the graphic designer who designed this
  flyer with no avail, as they've not replied to my messages.\r\n\r\nI would like
  to know what these fonts are for album art I am designing.\r\n\r\nYour replies are
  appreciated,\r\n\r\nDr. Kosher"

    body: Thank you for the quick replies, Fvilanakis!  It looks like Canter might
      fit the bill.  I am looking for the typeface that reads "Wyndham," as well,
      and I see that Canter has a light and a medium, but not a bold, or a black,
      and this seems to be bolder than the aforementioned.

    you are right, it's not bold enough for \"Wyndham\"\r\n\r\nIf you use an illustration
    package like Adobe Illustrator, InDesign or Corel Draw you can always create a
    artificially heavier weight using the bold font (this is probably what the graphic
    artist of the original poster did)."

  body: You are correct.  Upon further inspection of the poster, it seems the designer
    added a stroke to the font to add a thicker weight to it.  Thanks again for the
    quick response!  This forum saved me a lot of time, looking for these fonts!
