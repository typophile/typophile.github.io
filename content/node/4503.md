  body: Kris - <BR> <BR>The problem may be more complex than the setting you <BR>mention.
    In fact, your settings are correct. <BR> <BR>Aside from appearing out of order
    in the InDesign  <BR>glyphs window, I&#39;m assuming they appear out of order
    <BR>when you type as well? Can you post a screenshot of  <BR>the whole font as
    it appears in FontLab? I&#39;m guessing <BR>you&#39;re character assignments are
    out of wack.

  body: Thanks Eric. <BR> <BR>When I type in InDesign, there doesn&#39;t seem to be
    any  <BR>problem. Except when I output in unicode, the d and q <BR>go elsewhere!
    Two shots of the font window, one in  <BR>name, the other unicode - look at the
    d &amp; q do silly <BR>things.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/34532.gif"

  body: I&#39;m stumped on this. <BR>Aside from switching the offending characters
    into <BR>the correct slots and ensuring they&#39;re coded correctly by <BR>punching
    in the proper Unicode values... <BR>You need John on this one.
