  body: "Since I know nothing about the company, I can only voice my preference for
    the look. I prefer the second one (yellow balloon, sans). If you use the serif
    face, try the sans for the tagline. I assume the shape above the 'i' is supposed
    to look like a word balloon. Is that true?\r\n\r\nAlso, at smaller sizes, 'complete
    communications' will turn into ant tracks. Be careful. It should probably be at
    least 150-200% larger, I'd guess."

  body: "I have to agree with version 2, although the na needs a hair more space,
    the strapline (what is that face by the way?) seems caught between ranging right
    and centred under the yellow bubble (enlarging it would help avoid that). I think
    the bubble needs some work if it is to be a speech bubble.\r\nTim"

    As I previously stated, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12982\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>,
    I like / prefer the 2nd version, but I still think you will probably loose the
    finer lower end part of the 'speech bubble' / 'quote' detail, on the 'i', when
    scaling down the logotype.. )</em>"

  body: "To start \"Creative Marketing\" or \"Creative Communications\" work better
    but are very vanilla. Can you say something stronger about your business? \"Complete
    Communications\" once again could be a book publisher. \r\n\r\nOn the new logos:
    the top left the dot looks like a printing registration mistake. I like the middle
    left logo without the extra letter spacing. The talk balloon is cute.  "

  body: I like the talk balloon one as well. Also, 'creative marketing' isn't a very
    creative tagline.
