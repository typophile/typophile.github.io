  asked me to illustrate the process of drawing up the words 'The End'. From the sketch,
  to the final digital version in illustrator / type program. Its for a large client
  (Panasonic) and I need to version this in 26 languages, and I need to do 3 or 4
  stages for each one. (Sketch / Firming Up / Scanned in and illustrated / Final).
  aghh! \r\n\r\nThe font is set, Din Condensed Medium. So what I need to do is retro
  fit the idea to the font... \r\n\r\nSadly, I'm no expert typographer! I've built/tested
  a couple in my spare time for the fun of it, which is why I've been asked to do
  this.\r\n\r\nSo I wondered if anyone knows of any nice examples or tutorials of
  people drawing up there type. I'm just looking for the style of drawing, and what
  kind of grids/lines people use to help sketch, and then firm up their designs. \r\n\r\nAny
  help, much appreciated,\r\nRob."

    Din, but your AD is asking for pencil sketches? Why?\r\n\r\nEither way, I guess
    I'd: Set the type, print it, grab a pencil, hit the light table and trace.\r\n\r\n"
