  urging, the organization I work for has agreed to choose just one color of red for
  their logo and branding materials (when I started here there were four different
  colors of red being used inconsistently).  \r\n\r\nI am working with CS2 programs
  on a Windows PC, Windows XP, Service Pack 2.  The majority of our materials are
  print, and we have a small website that basically supports our printed material
  (curriculum for nutrition education) and is not emphasized as a marketing tool (yet).\r\n\r\nThe
  director has settled PMS 199.  The problem is, 199 in process is not the same color
  (at all).  So, I need to create a process swatch for our four-color print jobs.
  \ When I choose 199 in the old Pantone Solid to Process color library (Pantone 199
  PC), I get a process swatch.  When I chose 199 in the new Pantone Color Bridge Coated
  Color Library,(also Pantone 199 PC), it shows as a spot color.  Am I missing something?
  \ The colors in Pantone Color Bridge, marked PC, should be the process equivalent
  to the cooresponding spot color, no?\r\n\r\nIn Illustrator, I can manually change
  the color to process in the swatch dialog box, but is that really just a \"faux\"
  process, similar to a \"faux\" italic in type?  Will this make the printer hiccup?\r\n\r\nAm
  I better off just creating a process swatch and globalizing it? \r\n\r\nAlso, are
  there pitfalls to either swatch solutions I should look out for or discuss with
  my printer?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for any and all input."

  body: "I don't know the color bridge technology, but you should pic a solid that
    will convert well to process.\r\n\r\nThe Pantone guide, to me, is odd. I can often
    produce a better match with a custom mix. What I look for is a good synergy where
    the process match doesn't have any particularly small percentages of any process
    color. For example, no process color below 10%. That ensures that even low end
    projects/printers will be able to hold the mix well.\r\n\r\nIt helps to have a
    calibrated process proofing system with all your apps talking ICC. Still, you
    might even run your mix swatches out from different workflows (PDF, Photoshop,
    etc) and see how consistently the mix swatch renders.\r\n\r\nOther tips would
    be to stay away from black in the swatch mix so the printer can focus on the density
    of the black for the type without scewing the color."

  body: I think the biggest problem is that it is a red. Pantone reds are notorious
    for looking dead when converted to process. However, if you have a good relationship
    with your press perhaps they can help you with that?

  body: "Red is bad, so is blue.\r\n\r\nLooking at my process book the Pantone S 111-1
    looks like it isn't bad.\r\n\r\nC-10\r\nM-100\r\nY-60\r\nK-0\r\n\r\nGiven any
    printer will show variance in those percentages over a run, you've at least got
    a little cyan to put some punch in that purple cast."

  body: It's also virtually impossible to judge a print swatch from its appearance
    on screen. The tints appear not to match but then in print maybe they do. Or vice
    versa.

  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments; I always appreciate them!  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    PMS 199 is here to stay. It doesn't have any black in it so it screens back without
    getting greyish (although, of course, it goes pink!).  If you look at the color
    bridge swatch fan (not the screen -- I never chose colors based on what they look
    like on screen) you'll see that the spot color translates into process fairly
    well.  C =0, M - 100, Y = 65 (formerly 62) and K = 0.  It is a much better transition
    than, say, 1787 C.  \r\n\r\nMy question is this: Why is the swatch 199 in Color
    Bridge color library showing up as a spot color and not a process color in my
    files?  Aren't the Bridge colors (PC and UP) process?  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nzoya37"

  body: "I've got an older version that doesn't have the RGB values in the swatch
    book.\r\n\r\nI think you will need to spec a Pantone process color rather than
    the PMS color to get the process mix you want. If you let the software do the
    conversion of a PMS color each software will make its own conversion.\r\n\r\nMy
    point was that you can make a better match than what the Bridge or Pantone to
    Process swatch books show. Get a Pantone process book and compare it to the Pantone
    formula guide. That will get a good match that can be refined more if you want."

  body: The Pantone Euro Solid to Process gives 100m 60y for 199C. Looks pretty good
    in the printed fan, a touch pink, perhaps.
