  type, i've been looking for it for days, it reminds me of Futura, but it doesn't
  fit the C nor the M. I've concluded it down to Mostra-type or alike.\r\n\r\nDo you
  think it's a modified type?\r\nIf i would say a thicker version of this Gothic type
  http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olround-gothic/\r\n\r\nwould i be right?"

    when i don't find it..\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to be that familiar, maybe a higher
    risk of a modified type?"
