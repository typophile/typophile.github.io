  design).\r\n\r\nI am about <cite>60%</cite> sure that my school will not have the
  BA in Arts by the time I graduate. \r\n\r\nThat said: What types of things should
  I be aware of regarding applying to a GOOD MFA program? Will this really hamper
  me? Is it negligible? \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of opinions on this but you are all
  mostly experience professionals and I value your opinions. \r\n\r\nBest\u2014\r\n\r\n"
