  body: "So far all the versions I have found do not use the alternate characters,
    like the reverse bend 'p'.  URW, Elsner + Flake and Scangraphic all have similar
    (to each other) versions of 'Thorowgood', but none are identical to this sample.
    I guess it's just a similar look. \r\n\r\nSomeone like Jason Walcott (Jukebox
    at Veer)  might be the one who would have been more likely to digitize a display
    face like this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: You won't find a digital match, sadly. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=EF.6730.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Rip+Slyme&sampleSize=48">Carousel</a>
    is a close upright relative.
