    a dead-on match:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/Matamoros/fonts/\r\n\r\nIt appears
    to be an old woodtype face that may not have been revived digitally. Looking through
    old type specimens, and will report back if I find anything...."

    by Mike F...\r\n<blockquote>[...][[http://www.linotype.com/155164/mccollough-family.html|McCollough]]
    for me, Don.\r\nDesigned about 1898 by Gustav F Schroeder for ATF and - according
    to [[http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Schroeder/GustavFSchroeder.pdf|this
    Klingspor Museum PDF]] - originally spelled McCullagh.</blockquote>\r\n... and
    Don \r\n<blockquote>Matamoros NF is based on a similar but different font -- note
    for example the lazy s counters in _O_ and _Q_, similar to Inland Foundry's _Inland_
    -- from circa 1900 called Jason Wood by Dan X. Solo and sold by him in digital
    form with one of the Dover Books. Used for the title of the Solotype catalog.</blockquote>\r\nSo
    probably in your case McCullagh at its origin."
