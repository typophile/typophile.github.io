  body: More precisely, it was the film font Caslon Black Swash. Cabernet is by far
    the best digital version. It includes all of the alternates. In case you don't
    need a precise match, though, I thought I'd mention Nick Curtis's version, <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/emfatick-nf/" target="_blank">Emfatick</a>,
    which includes your alternate lowercase letters, but not that Y and L.
