  classes this semester and thinking about having it wire bound. It probably won\u2019t
  exceed 40 pages so I\u2019m thinking that a perfect binding will just fall apart,
  and I want it to lay flat so I can talk about it in interviews without having to
  hold it down. So I want to have it spiral bound. \r\n\r\nMy book-arts friends think
  I\u2019m just some sort of lazy monster, and are trying to convince me to do some
  wacky stitched binding or some other crazy thing, and say spiral bindings look cheap.
  Do designers really look down on spiral bindings, or are my friends just being snotty
  because they want to see everything hand bound from five kinds of paper with printed
  vellum tip-ins?"

  body: "Every binding system has its advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\n1) Perfect-binding
    requires a minimum thickness to be effective. I doubt your 40 pages, even if printed
    on cardstock, will be thick enough. (And if printed on cardstock will probably
    tear the binding apart.)\r\n\r\n2) Coil or Spiral bindings look nice and come
    in many colors and sizes. But, because of the nature of the spiral, opposing pages
    of spreads do not align. One side of the spread will always be lower than the
    other side. Only a problem if you've got crossovers.\r\n\r\n3) Wire-O bindings
    are slightly more complex than Spiral (looks somewhat like a wire version of Cerlox),
    but allow opposing pages of spreads to align. Also comes in many sizes and colors.
    As Chris mentioned, Coil and Wire-O bindings do not add structural strength to
    a book, so they tend to be floppy. Using a heavy card back cover to add strength
    is common.\r\n\r\n4) Saddle-stitching could work, depending on your page size.
    If doing the stitching yourself, you'll need a stapler that can accommodate the
    width of your printed page.\r\n\r\n5) Rivets & grommets also come in a variety
    of colors and sizes. Two options available: a single rivet will make a fanbook
    (think Pantone swatchbook); a couple rivets in line will seal one side of the
    book but this uses a lot of space. Anywhere from a half-inch to an inch of each
    page of your book will become inaccessible to the reader (this is easy enough
    to design around by adding additional space to each inside margin). "

  body: With only 40 pages, you could easily hand stitch it yourself using a two needle
    coptic binding which looks good, and most importantly lies flat because the two
    covers aren't joined together. Google 'coptic binding' - there are various ways
    of doing it, and it can  be done with easily available materials.

    don't think I properly addressed your question in my long-winded previous post.\r\n
    \r\nSpeaking only for myself, I do tend to view Spiral and Wire-O bindings as
    aesthetically inferior. So I guess I'm like your art-friends. I've also recommended
    and used both Spiral and Wire-O systems in different projects. I see them as gimmicky.
    I also see \"novelty\" typefaces as gimmicky. But I'll still use them, if they
    are right for the project."

  body: "Speaking from a user's point of view rather than a designer's point of view,
    why oppose a far more practical solution because of aesthetical preferences?\r\n\r\nSpiral
    bindings are probably underappreciated because the coil binding spines are made
    of plastic instead of traditional materials like leather or paper. The association
    with cheap spiral-bound notebooks doesn't help either. The difficulty of utilizing
    the spines for displaying the title of the publication, making identification
    difficult when shelved, must be another reason it is not used for more expensive
    projects--they would be harder to display in bookstores and the like.\r\n\r\nI
    think that's a shame because there are lots of situations where one needs a lie-flat
    binding, and spiral bindings are hard to beat there. Not only do they lie flat,
    you get 360-degree rotation at any position in the book. From my own experiences,
    dense mathematical texts can often benefit from being spiral-bound as one often
    has to have them open at a single page and take several minutes studying the material
    on that page, all the while taking notes or solving problems using the page as
    a reference.\r\n\r\nUsing hard covers takes care of the slouching when placed
    on bookshelves should it become a problem. If the book is really thick, the pages
    will follow the curve of the coils when closed rather than line up neatly, but
    that won't be a problem with 40 pages."

  body: "If your book art friends think you're a lazy monster, probably some others
    will too. It's human nature to look down on everyone who uses things not to their
    liking, and designers, as a generality, are all too human.\r\n\r\nHere's a thought:
    In a town the size of Washington D.C., there has to be a number of people who
    teach classes in hand binding. Even in Durham, North Carolina, there are a couple.
    My wife took a couple of these courses, and most of the projects involved binding
    books of less than 40 pages. Anyway, for a fee, one of the teachers would probably
    bind your project for you, with nice covers.\r\n\r\nOn a more general note, if
    you don't mind the art-book people looking down on you for a bit, your schoolwork
    gets you your first job. You get your second job based on what you achieved in
    your first job -- You won't be showing your schoolwork during your interviews
    for the second job. For the second & subsequent jobs, even the school itself is
    less important than what you've achieved at work. I'd hire a good, productive
    person who had gone to the local community college over a RISD grad whose professional
    work wasn't quite as good."

    make it look less ugly in the eyes of your \"book-arts-friends\" is to make a
    hidden spiral binding. You add as last \"sheet\" to bind no \"sheet of paper\"
    but a simple cardboard with the width of approx. 4 times the width of your papersize
    plus the width of the spine (??correct term??). The cardboard is four times ??channeled/scored??.

    tends to be thick and colorful, while wire-o is usually thin and black. And as

    tends to come undone more easily, in my experience.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Oh, and I agree
