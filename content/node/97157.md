  to be elnarged as well, and optically thinned down after that, which i didn't have
  time to do here.\r\n\r\nWhere did this style come from?  Does it have a proper name?
  \ Are there any fonts that are built like this?"

    way.\r\n\r\nIt could, however, be achieved by using a titling font instead of
    the regular caps."

  body: This is seen in children's books, especially those that seek to draw attention
    to words that start with the same letter. I'm not aware of any fonts made this
    way, and it isn't really necessary since character styling in any decent page
    layout app can achieve the result.

  body: "I found one of the URW fonts I remembered, called Antique Olive DC D. It
    is not C/lc as I thought, but is a C/sc font with the large caps centered vertically
    on the small caps which are base-aligned.\r\n\r\nI recall someone telling me when
    I first saw it in the late nineties that it was a style of alignment popular in
    Europe but I kind of think that is not true. I had never seen anything like it,
    and still don't have any idea why it would be useful."

    work only appeared once a page or so."

    camera, so you can't really even see the base line.  There must be a better pic
    out there.
