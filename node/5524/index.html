		<div class="commentbody">Following your advices i thought about different or changed symbols to use for the logo. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the first one i did something completely different. Basic idea is to use a gradient to again convey the idea of movement or speed. I decided to make it a mosaic to give it a nice touch. Of course you could also read it as reference to screen design, i.e. pixels. Now, i am not sure if that is all too far fetched to make sense. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second one is taking the vortex idea a little further and making it more prominent. Also that way the symbol is more simple and easier to grasp than in the original. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Third is basically the original, i just took out one layer of shapes to make it a little less complex as well. Those of you that said they got an impression of organic growth from it are right. There is a certain resemblance to a flower as well. I actually had this in the back of my mind when i made it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the type, i really liked the suggestion by Sally to use a different color on the dot. I think it works well because it makes the dot less dominant so you don't trip over it when looking at it, while it still works to separate the two words. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In earlier incarnations of design i did use italics and bold type on rush and media like suggested, but this time i would rather not do that as i found it makes the name look unbalanced. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What are your ideas on these designs, what direction do you think i should go?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi all, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thanks again for the feedback. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First let me try to explain what i would like to convey with a symbol for my firm. It should symbolize attributes like motion, energy and excitement. Not only because that is connected to the word rush, but also because these are desirable attributes for the work i do - at least in the case of excitement. If you haven't done so you can go to rushmedia.de to get an idea of my work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That said, it seems my attempts so far didn't work well. As Soren pointed out the symbols i used are still too static. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still like the idea of a vortex, and i wonder if i could change it in a way to make the element of motion apparent enough. However i also think about other images that could be used to symbolize motion. I want to stay with simple abstract shapes if possible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will work on new/improved symbols. If you have any further suggestions i am happy to hear them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think their is something in the square mark that is intreaging. You have subtley created motion within the square shape by using variations of color. The contrast of elements is kind of nice. Plus you reference pixels which is a nice connection to the multimedia world. In fact, motion on screen is created by the changes of color from pixel to pixel. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There would be no need to round the edges of the square. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Asymetry is what creats motion! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In keeping with many of the other postings I agree that the spiral versions of your logo are not quite hitting the mark. They seem more representive of spinning (which can be more of a negative ie: spinning one's wheels but getting nowhere) than &quot;rushing&quot; or getting from here to there. At first I wasn't wild for the dot. Depending upon your clients, it could be confusing for them as they look for the url rush.media. Who are you branding yourself to? If they are tech savy it's not an issue of course but on the whole the general public still finds the web a little overwhelming and confusing. On your second go-around with the colored dot it became more of a graphic element and therefore less likely it would be misinterputed as part of an address.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So far I like the square/pixel version however, I would suggest making the dot a small square.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall perhaps you should re-think your design elements. In your first posting you said these were refinements from previously used designs, are you trying to keep the old elements simply for recognition?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just went to your web site. The spiral logos do look like flowers and you use a lot of floral imagery on your site, perhaps it's the name that should be re-thought, flowers don't really convey the concepts of speed and energy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the continued support. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some of you liked the idea of my pixel symbol, hinting to screen design and using the gradient to convey an idea of movement. I took the idea one step further to add the kind of rush i was looking for. Putting the square in perspective i think it combines the impression of motion and of the pixels as the elements of screen design. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I made two versions for now, with slightly different angles. Also i tried if i could place the symbol behind the word in the smaller version. Just food for thought. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I really prefer the rounded corners on the symbol for a number of reasons. First, it gives a nice resemblance to the image of a screen. Second, it &quot;holds together&quot; the single squares, making it look more like one unit. And last, it works well together quite well with the font used imho. I also made the dot between the words into a rounded rectangle to go along with the symbol. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Below, there is different versions of the vortex symbols. I tried to add more motion to them. I am not convinced though and the approach maybe just doesn't work. No matter what it always looks more like a flower than anything else. I wanted to put them here anyways though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am very much leaning towards the &quot;pixel and screen&quot; symbol, it looks fresh and clean, and i really like the abstract approach. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your comments? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andrew&ndash; Thanks for your thoughts. I also like the concept of the skewed square the most so far. To me it has a strong expression, yet its simple enough.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Soren&ndash; You are or have been thinking on a different level than i about the theories of movement and pixel placement it seems. While i think i can follow your ideas it seems i don't get down to what you are actually meaning. I have been playing with pixels on paper and in my mind, but i don't seem to be able to create that strong movement. How would you arrange a set of pixels that depicts &quot;rush&quot;? Something like streaks?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My thoughts when i did the last designs was of a moving object (the bigger pixels) that will leave a trail (of smaller pixels). So the different pixels sizes were not meant as an information of distance, though i agree this is true also. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other symbol of a &quot;screen&quot; could be animated, yes. I did not do this for now, as it has to work as well without it, it would just be a nice little enhancement for the web. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think i would agree, after all the different designs, that maybe one of these will work just as good in their own way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andrew&ndash; Thanks for the suggestion, thats a good concept. I just wonder if you imagine to merge this into the idea of the square symbol, or if that is supposed to be a different idea. Looking at it i could imagine using the skewed square i have and blending it into this row of shapes. So that i am retaining the skewed square as a mark and at the same time use the stronger dynamics you propose. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David&ndash; Why would i want to show motion? That is the concept i want to base this mark on, so of course its supposed to show motion not only in a digital media context, i.e. on the webpage where it is actually possible to animate the symbol, but also if it is printed and not actually moving. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The color orange? First of all it was/is a personal preference, but beyond that orange is considered a color that represents energy, enthusiasm, creativity, to name a few. So it is very appropriate imho. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe I'm crazy&hellip;Probably&hellip;.but in the context of this particular critique I saw a potentially strong idea. I respoded to the idea of the logo acutally being motionless in print, and then &quot;IN Motion&quot; on the web.(Motion in the since of changing colors in a rigid square to create the idea of motion) My favorite logo in this whole post was M's post #12 top left(except for the round corners).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hypothetical situation: Say I recieved a letterhead from your company. On that letterhead was a square with 6(maybe 4) squares in it of different color shades. Next to that square (motionless square) logo it said &quot;rich media, motion graphics&quot; I would think to myself what does this motionless logo have to do with motion graphics, Hmmmmm. Then I would go to your website and see the 6(maybe 4) squares constantly changing color on the website&hellip; And then I would realize why the logo on the PRINTED Piece was unable to show motion because it was a frieze frame of the logo on the web. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ah Hell, Maybe I'm nuts!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi everybody, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->i have spent some days thinking about this design and how to improve on its weak points. Also thanks to your input that i value a lot. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have been stuck with the screen symbol that on one hand carries some good ideas but also has its shortcomings. Main point in question is the impression of movement it conveys. I could not come up with any convincing solution to fix that lack of motion. I tried with Andrew's suggestion, but the breaking point was to create a mark that is not becoming too complex. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am still all for the idea of animating a symbol on the web and want to stick with the use of visible pixels. However the mark also has to work for print use in a non-animated state, which turns out to be a problem. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Following these thoughts i decided to come up with more distinct shapes. Since previous pixel designs were already hinting to arrows, this is what i went with here. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The right one is something that just happened when playing around and i found it looks interesting. The left one is the serious suggestion, which is easy to recognize as arrows. At the same time i have made changes to the type, as it seemed that with a small and light symbol it works better to combine the two words and distinguish them by font weight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please let me know how your impression is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

Answer: the pixels would change color(shades of grey), however they WOULD NOT CHANGE SHAPE. The pixels would stay SQUARE.This is why IMPO the logo using the Basic Square was the strongest concept you have shown so far.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your comments,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andrew&ndash; You are right that your suggested arrow shapes provide a stronger feeling of movement. However in my impression they feel too heavy and massive. Why i separated mine and used the angle is because i actually like feeling of ease and lightness i get from it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plus i didn't completely drop the idea of pixels, even though they are less prominent then before. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David&ndash; Your idea of moving, as in shifting color, pixels is great.  I had understood your concept right away. My only problem, and i am still not absolutely sure if that really is a problem, is that for print use it is possibly not distinct enough. So i am thinking, while still using pixels, build a shape from the pixels that again speaks motion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott&ndash; Different colors is definitely an option. I have been thinking about using color for the logotype as well. I will try a cool grey. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am leaning towards the concept with arrow shapes, but maybe i can get some more opinions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's not a problem if you are a &quot;motion/web&quot; designer. One solution to this ? would be to use a different logo on each variation of printed matter.

You have infinite flexibility in terms of how many variations of hue that can exist in the square verision of your logo.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The reason why you might use different logos on each piece is so you will create the overall illusion of motion from one thing to the next. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The logo is changing at all times, even on your own stationery.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I feel like the new logo and the original(vortex) logo have similar qualities and directions about them. It feels like you are trying to say to much in the latest logo. It is confusing as to which direction you want the logo to take me. There are three arrows pointing inward and one out. I personaly can't wrap my head around this rationale. The logo and the type also feel like they are in two different dimensions. What made you choose that typeface? To me the logo looks a little to Galaga( the video game) It feels like it's going to shoot another spaceship any moment. I guess you know my opinion at this point and so I'll stop blabbing. My favorite is still the 6 squares forming one square. That logo tells me all I need to know and leaves infinite possiblilities to my imagination. Look at how Hewlett Packard has used the PLUS symbol. Or the H+R block green square. The green square is so symbolic it is freaking mind boggling. Anyway, good luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your comments. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As it is always one of the toughest things to create your own identity, i myself am still not satisfied completely with the logo i created. I know its probably okay but no masterpiece. Since i have no deadline i think i will let it sit at the back of my mind for a little longer. I am just afraid i'd end up having a totally different idea and starting over. ;) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No matter what, i have and am learning a lot from your input. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daniel, as you noticed, my website also needs a bit of update. This is on my far to long to-do list. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And David, please be assured i really like your idea. I just couldn't see that this is what i want here, since i like a logo that can also simply look good, for all those that are not designers. Saying that, i understand your complaint that the last logo is too complicated again. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The typeface indeed was never discussed, its now contrasting with the hard edges of the logo to some degree. I had chosen it right in the beginning because it is modern and fresh, yet still serious.</div>
