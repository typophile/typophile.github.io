<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm doing a motion graphics video on Benton's gothics. My question is, should <a href=http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/globegothic.html>Globe Gothic</a>, even though it is a reworking of Taylor Gothic, be included with the others below?
Franklin Gothic
Alternate Gothic
Clearface Gothic
News Gothic
Lightline Gothic
Novel Gothic
Bank Gothic
Agency Gothic
Raleigh Gothic
Headline Gothic
Any comments would be greatly appreciated.
btw I've never seen Taylor Gothic just read about it</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not familiar with Taylor Gothic either. But the Globe Gothic sample seems very inspired by Clearface (or could it be vice versa?). If Clearface predates any of them then I would be inclined to give the nod to Benton.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You need to read the <a href=http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/inland/ target=new>actual article</a> in it's entirety, but a portion is extracted from Luc Devroye's page on The Inland Press. (Luc sites his sources: "The sources for this text include an article by James Eckman in PAGA, vol. 8, pp. 31-52, 1960, entitled The Inland Type Foundry, 1894-1911, and an annotated list of typefaces in Mac McGrew's famous book, American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century (1986, Oak Knoll, New Castle, DE).")
<em>Globe Gothic is a refinement of Taylor Gothic, designed about 1897 by ATF at the suggestion of Charles H. Taylor of the Boston Globe, and used extensively by that paper. But Taylor Gothic has mostly the same lowercase as Quentell, though with hairlines heavied a bit. ATF's Central Type Foundry branch in St. Louis claims to have originated Quentell (q.v.) in 1895 or earlier. The conversion to Taylor Gothic was designed by Joseph W. Phinney, while the redesign as Globe Gothic in about 1900 is credited to Morris Benton.</em>
Also, you should read this <a href=http://www.typophile.com/threadrss/18136 target=new>OLD Typophile thread</a> containing McGrew's claim about Studley vs. Taylor/Globe Gothic (though I could only find it as an XML feed... a little distracting read).

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the input.
Globe, 1900, does predate Clearface, 1905.
The McGrew quote on Globe clarifies it's history but I'm still not sure if it's original enough to include with his other gothics. </div>

<div class=commentbody>If it's "originals" that you are listing, I personally would follow the references on "Taylor Gothic" (J.W. Phinney) as being <em>closer</em> to the original and "Globe Gothic" (M.F. Benton) as being a refinement/rework.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well that's kinda my question. When a type designer does a face that is a refinement or rework of another face can you say that's their design? Or, if you were making a list of Benton's gothics what criteria would you use or should you use?
Thanks

Ah, the old revival vs innovation argument.
MF Benton worked at a time of consolidation of foundries, caused by the advent of machine typesetting--which had collapsed the demand for foundry type for extended text. Pieces of the foundry type industry were put together by ATF, and MF Benton redrew, modified, and innovated the types of the companies they bought out. He did over a hundred faces--with superb craftsmanship. To what extent he reproduced and to what extent innovated varies with the typeface, and it is a major undertaking to trace exactly what happened.
So the only way to be accurate is to tell the history, and that takes a lot of historical research.</div>
