  It looks like a total redesign and includes a type tester. \r\nNick, when did you
  post the new site (or am I so far behind that I just didn't know :-)\r\n\r\nCongrats,
  Nick! Lookin' good!\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\n"

  body: "i really like it too, but i miss the descriptive texts about each typeface
    that were on his old site. maybe i just haven't unearthed them yet.\r\nalso, everyone
    needs to bug him about having \"index\" as the title of his homepage. >^p"

  body: "Thanks for the comments, people.\r\nI'm waiting for a proper announcement
    of the redesign until the shop is up and running.\r\n\r\nThe descriptive texts
    are history, there's too much talk about type, people should just use it. That's
    my new marketing philosophy, although I'm finding it difficult to restrain myself
    from blabbering on about the types in a couple of the PDF specimens. Memo to self:
    features, Nick, not cultural influences!\r\n\r\nThe site was designed by Aleksey
    Liskovsky, who interned with me earlier this year."

  body: "I can address that here, Stephen.\r\n\r\nHaven't the best specimens always
    been the ones where the only text is the font specimen, with its peculiar poetry?\r\n\r\nI
    kept the showings like that, not giving visitors any straight prose to think about,
    just play around.\r\n\r\nEric Shinn wrote the sample text, by running some marginally
    relevant text backwards and forwards through Babelfish a few times, among other
    things.\r\n\r\nThere is information, mainly technical, on the fonts in the PDFs.
    \r\n\r\nCorrection, Aleksey's name is Lisovsky."
