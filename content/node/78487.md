body: "I am constructing a font for use with ancient Greek and Roman metrics (as in
  poetry, not as in character sidebearings!).  There are a few simple signs (breve,
  longum, anceps [like the multiplication x sign]) and then many complex signs which
  are combinations of these simple signs.  So I decided to use <ccmp> to form the
  combined characters, like this:\r\n\r\nfeature ccmp {\r\nscript latn;\r\n  sub uni0311
  uni23D1 uni23D1 multiply by mt01;\r\n  sub uni23D1 uni23D1 endash uni23D1 by mt02;\r\n
  \ sub endash afii301 bar afii301 uni23D1 afii301 uni23D1 by mt03;\r\n} ccmp;\r\n\r\nmt01,
  mt02, and mt03 are the names of my fancy combination characters.  It would be safest
  if the user entered a ZWJ between the simple elements in order to avoid any situation
  where adjacent characters might combine when that was not wanted.  So I tried that
  on the third line of the code above.  (afii301 is the name of the ZWJ, U+200D).\r\n\r\nThe
  code works fine in FL's preview and the font is generated with no error messages.
  \ However, outside of FL, I cannot get the third character, the one with the ZWJs,
  to work.  The non-ZWJ ones are fine in NotePad and XeLaTeX and BabelPad.  Can anyone
  see what's wrong?  I use FL Studio 5 on Vista with SP2.\r\n\r\nThanks - David"
