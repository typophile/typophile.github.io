  body: "This designer is really not so much of a has-been, but more of a definitely
    won't-be.\r\nWhen this designer opens her mouth, it seems that this is only to
    change whichever foot was previously in there.\r\nThis designer reminds me very
    much of a gyroscope - always spinning around at a frantic pace, but not really
    going anywhere.\r\nThis young lady has delusions of adequacy.\r\nWhen he joined
    my agency, this designer was something of a granny; since then he has aged considerably.\r\nThis
    designer sets low personal standards and then consistently fails to achieve them.\r\nThis
    designer has the wisdom of youth, and the energy of old age.\r\nThis designer
    should go far - and the sooner he starts, the better.\r\nWorks well when under
    constant supervision and cornered like a rat in a trap.\r\nThis designer is depriving
    a village somewhere of an idiot.\r\nOnly occasionally wets himself under pressure.
