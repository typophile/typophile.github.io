  used this font a while back, but i'ts not installed anymore. The software is complaining
  about this missing font, and it's called 'ridiculous'. But any Google search with
  this name brings up a different font. Not the one I want. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help
  me with this? I already tried the ususal search by image sites.\r\n\r\nPaul"

    book that someone did as a font. Have looked several places but no luck.
