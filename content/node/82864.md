  <em>consistent</em> looking website designs, here is the best practice guideline
  I have converged to. For anything larger than 16px in font-size:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ff-vs-cufon_4394.png]\r\n\r\nIf
  it were not for the pinch zooming on iOS devices, it would've been Cufon all the
  way.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIf you sell font licenses for the web usage, please <em>please</em>
  make them Cufon friendly. No self-respecting pirate will ever care to convert obscured
  Javascript outlines back into mangled OTFs, when it is far easier to find the originals
  on torrent sites. But having a Cufon option <em>will</em> make the fonts far more
  attractive and useful to the web designers.\r\n\r\nIf you are set on a service business
  model with recurrent charges, consider offering Cufon .js the same way you currently
  offer @font-face files. In the end this is not about paying less or more, it is
  about having a website look the same on all platforms. Something that is currently
  <em>impossible</em> to do with just the @font-face.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Replacement for everyone else?\r\n\r\nAnd I think there is much, much less concern
    these days for consistent appearance from device to device, browser to browser.
    Half the time, it seems like nobody tests further than Safari on Mac.\r\nAnyway,
    embracing and delighting in the differences is going to make for greater happiness.
    Learn to love ugly - I'm amazed at how forgiving people seem to be about it when
    it comes to fonts."

    been a long asked for thing from folks but that's just not what the web is about.
    The best way to describe it is that web design is about suggesting a design...rather
    than controlling it. \r\n\r\nThat said, yea, Web font rendering still has a way
    to go on many platforms, so I don't blame you for switching to Cufon. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    main problem with SiFR is the Flash dependency, especially considering the proliferation
    of FlashBlock and similar plugins.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI am mulling over writing
    a replacement rendering engine for Cufon that would outsource the rasterization
    to the web server. In other words when it would come to actually drawing text
    on the canvas, it would instead talk to a web server, have it draw that text into
    a .png instead and then fetch and display the resulting image. Basically a form
    of <a href=http://facelift.mawhorter.net>FLIR</a> that works as a drop-in replacement
    for Cufon.\r\n\r\nIf I am to take the idea a bit further, this could actually
    be wrapped in a service run by the foundries themselves. And under the very same
    recurrent billing model used for @font-face licensing.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n@Darrel
    - I should've said \"looking good across all platforms\" rather than \"the same\".
    Not achievable with @font-face in larger sizes at the moment as I'm sure you know."

    their products. Screens that break too easily, batteries you can't change on your

    some developers are anti-Flash now is that they're emotionally attached to a brand,
    not least because they are also emotional <em>users</em> of \"cool\" gadgetry.
    Their consumerist loyalties overpower their pragmatism.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'll

    the fact that one needs to do it differently for different browsers, is probably
    better.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I experimented with it. TeX Gyre Schola worked perfectly.
    Goudy Bookletter 1911, however, crashed it. That face has some coding issues,
    and points are missing at extrema according to FontForge, so the fault likely
    lies in the font and not Cufon."

  body: "... the good news (from my perspective) is that Linden Hill, from the same
    source, works.\r\n\r\nOf course, Cufon has serious limitations. CSS has to be
    used for leading - that isn't really a limitation, except that CSS is slightly
    more awkward to use with it. But the big limitation is that you can't have it
    substitute multiple fonts, giving each font certain tags - although there's a
    workaround involving a fancy JavaScript utility that turns various scripts on
    and off.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the technique it uses means that people have to
    \"view source\" to copy text off the page... that will annoy people, and start
    some on their first step to becoming hackers. For some content, of course, it's
    largely irrelevant.\r\n\r\nOf course, for an open-source font, embedding is not
    required, and so @font-face probably is the right way to go for most purposes."
