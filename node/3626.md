  body: very cool! i love it! <BR>this face fits very well with the retro style illustrations.
    i wish you&#39;d give us a bit more info about the premise and setting of the
    cartoon &#40;is it mexico in the mid 50s? cuz that&#39;s what it feels like to
    me but then again maybe that&#39;s just the name giving me that vibe&#41;. <BR>Personally
    i wouldn&#39;t set the leaning figure in the middle of the word cape, i&#39;d
    put him before the C. but overall this is very fresh &amp; inventive. good job!
    <BR>oh, btw, if you need any inspiration for comic book fonts it&#39;d be worth
    yer while to head over to blambot.com &#40;but i&#39;m sure yer probably quite
    familiar with that site as well as comicraft&#41;.

  body: Hey Paul, <BR>              This is one of those cases where the potential
    cartoon was sort of being written as the typeface was being created.  I like your
    assumption of 1950&#39;s Mexico though, though I don&#39;t think I could write
    that as I do not want to assume I know the people and culture of 1950&#39;s Mexico.  Right
    now my only description is that it&#39;s about a group of &#34;hip cats&#34; and
    their unusual personalities in the big inner city of Cape Donkey.  I&#39;m just
    as confused and that&#39;s half of the fun! <BR> <BR>-Mitch

  body: 'Hello &#34;Mitch&#34; <BR>I think your figures are very original and fun.  However,
    I don&#39;t think that the &#34;girl&#34; icon at the end of the digbat line doesn&#39;t
    go with the line weight of the other dingbats.  Also, the numbers, &#34;4, 5,
    6, &amp; 9&#34; don&#39;t have the thin strokes like all the other characters....maybe
    you should go for consitency on these.  Finally, I think the &#34;zero, 8, I,
    &amp; A&#34; don&#39;t quite fit in the typeface.  Great start.  '

  body: Hi, <BR> <BR>It appears that you have quite a few overlapping paths &#40;I
    can&#39;t tell if they are intentional or not&#41;. Make sure you get rid of those
    or your font will have issues with printing etc.

  body: Hey Matthew, <BR>                     The overlapping path look was indeed
    intentional, inspired by a mistake early on in the design process.  It sort of
    follows a design element I want to use in the backgrounds of the city etc. <BR>

  body: hey mitch, definately keep the fractured letters as a design element. but
    it think what matt is meaning is that they technically shouldn&#39;t be overlapping.
    &#40;but i&#39;m sure you knew that already&#41; I believe you can fix this if
    you use the &#34;merge contours&#34; feature in FontLab, but then again, I don&#39;t
    really know what yer building this in! <BR>One last note, i know that you&#39;re
    pushing the boundaries of traditional letterforms in this one, but to my eyes
    the 3 and 4 are almost unrecognizable &#40;without the greater context&#41; perhaps
    think about reworking those?
