body: "I was just wondering if it would be at all possible to get an education in
  typography, at say Reading, without having a prior background (in my case and undergraduate
  degree) in graphic design. \r\n\r\nThe college I want to go to (N.C. State) has
  a wonderful Graphic Design program, which includes Typography courses, but I fear
  that it is too late for me to create a portfolio. So instead, I was planning to
  major in Communications instead."
