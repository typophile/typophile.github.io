  body: "Now that's an unusual question.\r\n\r\nThis question involves too many links
    in the chain, though, to be considered a single issue from start to finish.\r\n\r\nWhen
    it comes to libraries, one thing to remember is that they tend to be funded by
    local sources of tax revenue. Hence, they will not be likely to purchase books
    that are needlessly expensive. \r\n\r\nThus, they're not likely to purchase luxurious
    private press editions of works that are already available in more utilitarian
    editions.\r\n\r\nThis additional constraint would need to be kept in mind to answer
    your original question as posed.\r\n\r\nBecause the question that can be answered,
    or at least examined directly, in a more reasonable fashion is: which kinds of
    books (as defined in terms of subject area) are more likely to be produced with
    an eye to quality typography?\r\n\r\nSeveral categories come to mind.\r\n\r\nEditions
    of classic works of poetry (such as Edward Fitzgerald's translation of the Rubaiyat
    of Omar Khayyam, a special case, as there have been several mass-market editions
    of this work designed to resemble private-press editions in elaborateness), short
    fiction, or even some essays - the kind of material found in private press editions.\r\n\r\nBooks
    about typography, advertising layout, art, and related subjects.\r\n\r\nSome types
    of children's books, I think, although someone here has questioned that."

    that's good. That's i need\r\n\r\nActually, i wanted to observe would Typography
    quality in books attract people to come along to the library. In case of my country,
    Indonesia, with typographically bad-quality books, people don't really like reading
    (so, they're hard to be educated), and the people in the low of finance (so, they
    couldn't buy books neither). I concern to elevate the people's reading interest
    with typography art in every books. So, they would be helped to be attracted to
    read those books.\r\n\r\nAnd probably the categories that people need most here
    are literature books, science book, and everything else that could educate & civilize
    people."

  body: "This is a different question indeed.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the wealthy
    nations, the market demands books that meet a certain standard of typographic
    quality. Even if it costs a bit more to make a book this way, it will be printed
    on white paper, such things as margins and leading will be reasonably generous,
    and so on.\r\n\r\nOf course, we're still not all that rich, so pocket books and
    paperbacks and second-hand books are still very popular.\r\n\r\nBut even pocket
    books, printed on newsprint, still are more easily readable than many of the books
    from the later nineteenth century, when there was a great deal of competition
    to make books as cheaply as possible, and so typefaces were narrow and ugly, and
    printing was usually in smaller point sizes.\r\n\r\nSo I would analyze this situation
    as follows:\r\n\r\nArtistic typography will make an individual book eye-catching,
    and so people who have come to the library might pick up that book and look at
    it first.\r\n\r\nBut just getting the basics right - making sure the book is easy
    and comfortable to read without eyestrain - combined with ensuring that what is
    in the book is what they are interested in reading will count for more.\r\n\r\nEven
    here in our educated and civilized society, the most popular books in the public
    libraries are in the fiction section. Despite the books in Indonesia not having
    good typographic quality, I suppose you still have, and thus don't \"need\" more,
    romance novels, detective stories, and things like that.\r\n\r\nEducation that
    people can apply in their own lives - things like cookbooks, books on household
    repairs, on sewing - won't be ignored.\r\n\r\nAnd there will be people who will
    want to widen their horizons if it's made easy and interesting - books written
    for the lay person about science, for example, are popular. And your country's
    traditional literature wouldn't have survived if it wasn't entertaining to the
    ordinary people.\r\n\r\nBut don't set your sights <em>too</em> high. Pretty typography
    will <em>not</em> bring them to a library that chooses its books on the basis
    of \"Read this, it's good for you\". Educating and civilizing people only works
    if you remember that to work it must be a slow and gentle process."

  body: "I used to work at a public library (although my job didn't include ordering
    the books). The librarians didn't personally inspect most of the books prior to
    ordering them. They ordered them based on factors such as which books were on
    the bestseller lists, which books had received the best reviews, which books were
    needed to fill holes in the library's collection, etc.  \r\n\r\nI'm sure most
    librarians love an attractively-designed book, but they generally wouldn't know
    anything about the typographic qualities of the books prior to ordering them unless
    it was something that was mentioned, good or bad, in the reviews.\r\n\r\nIn recent
    years libraries have seen more and more of their budgets being used to purchase
    things other than traditional books -- computers, electronic books, audio books,
    videos, music CDs, etc. In the future we'll probably much less shelf space devoted
    to traditional books as more and more of their customers (especially younger ones)
    will want ebooks instead. "
