  body: look the frist and the second &#34;e&#34; don&#39;t have a similar drawn.
    <BR> <BR>i&#39;m think is a handwriting drawn, not a font

  body: I agree with Josep, this is custom drawn, Paul. Maybe  <BR>we can find similar
    stuff that gets you reasonably close,  <BR>but you won&#39;t get a match.

  body: Thanks everyone. Yes, hand-drawn seems to be the correct answer. We have done
    more research here and the boss reckons he&#39;s tracked down the actual artist/designer
    - to a suburb of Sydney called Palm Beach. Please call off the hounds on this
    one. Unless you want to still discuss the age...?
