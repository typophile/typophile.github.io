body: HI All, <BR>Trying to find the font equivalent of Churchward 70 Hairline as
  shown in Rookledge&#39;s Typefinder. I saw it on a piece for Bjork, maybe an album
  cover, not sure. The closest I&#39;ve come is Ronda, but that&#39;s not it. Thought
  it might be a Lettraset/Fontek font but it&#39;s not. I assume someone has knocked
  it off. Thanks for your help.
