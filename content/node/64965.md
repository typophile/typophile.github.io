  you like it or not and why. Also what shall I draw for the bottom 2 rows? I just
  need one image but not sure (whale?zebra?unicorn?) they don't seem to go with butterfly,
  deer, bird house, rabbit, flower and tree. Wheat? Water? is that too weird?\r\n\r\nthanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/abc-poster3b_4532.jpg]"

    and very modern. Excellent color scheme. Is this your font? If so, I''d be interested
    in talking to you about purchasing rights. I''d say wheat, by the way. Water doesn''t
    feel right, contextually. '

    contrasts the tender parts.\r\n\r\nBy the way, try to confine your image size
    next time. It makes watching much more comfortable. Go with approx. 18cm width/72dpi."

    which I love as well.\r\n\r\nAndreas,\r\n\r\nI like your idea, but this will be
    screen printed and I am not sure I can afford another color : )\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Also anyone that has any ideas for the last 6 letters : any of these: u v
    w x y z.  I would love to hear.\r\n\r\nI am leaning towards wheat, but it does
    not seem quite childlike enough. I mean a child would know what rabbits, deer,
    butterflies, trees, flowers, bird houses are..but would they know or care about
    wheat? I thought about unicorns but they are not \"real\" and the rest of the
    things are. Most abc posters have a zebra, but that doesn't seem to fit either.
    Please make suggestions : )\r\n\r\nthanks again!"

  body: "Don,\r\n\r\nGreat suggestions (especially the windmill)! I wonder if you
    have a few more? I love them, but I am still looking for something that will go
    with the others a bit better. To me the bird house, flower, tree, rabbit, deer,
    butterfly all feel like an english countryside with a cottage on it (you know
    vintage, but fresh). I feel like it would be weird to add in something incongruous
    at this point. Like here are somethings that would work theme wise...but not with
    the letters I have:\r\n\r\nbicycle, frog, lilly pad (do you think I can get away
    with this as a water lilly for W???), bridge, picnic blanket...you see what I
    mean?\r\n\r\nthanks so much!"
