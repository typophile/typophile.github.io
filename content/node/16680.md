  couldn't afford the book, and google throws up zip. It looks bloody weird, and I
  like it!\r\n\r\nKris."

  body: As far as I know, [[Image Club]] offered the only digital version of Antikva
    Margaret. The digitization was rather quick-and-dirty, but I'd love to be able
    to redo it some day. I have a VGC specimen of the phototype version set at about
    30pt, if that helps.

    if you redo it, you'll have to do something about those curly braces. I've been
    drawing some of my own lately, and have been struck by how little attention they
    get in so many otherwise well-digitized faces."

    It was called Antikva ... Margaret isn't present.

    trying to get a digital version?

    Design Competition sponsored by Visual Graphics Corporation (VGC), maker of the
    Typositor filmsetting machine. It was designed by Zoltan Nagy of Hungary. I believe
    there is an effort to revive it by current Hungarian designers, not sure of who
    to contact."
