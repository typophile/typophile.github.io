  body: I think so, too, but that G spur has been killing me. Must be modified. I
    thought maybe Jim Parkinson had done it, but it&#39;s not on his site.

  body: Gentlemen, I strongly believe that is Times Bold, squooshed to 54%. I created

  body: 'Sorry, I hadn&#39;t seen what you had done above. I take back my Century
    id. &#40;Further embarrassment: I now realize that I was hanging onto Century
    due to a letter that&#39;s not even in the sample. Good thing I&#39;m so cute.&#41;'
