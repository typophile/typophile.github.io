  it&#39;s own label,  <BR>if it morphed into an online &#39;foundry&#39; that  <BR>sold
  original fonts, developed right here in <BR>these forums? I know it is a lot of
  work for  <BR>the Punchcut crew, but there must be a <BR>reasonable amount of traffic
  through here <BR>to generate sales. Or is this just silly? <BR> <BR>kris.
