  body: "hmmm, this doesn't look like it came from Sloop at all.\r\n\r\nThis one actually
    looks Custom, in other words, designed/drawn/built from scratch. In this case,
    it feels like it was done by hand, before it ended up on a T-shirt. It could be
    the handiwork of an LA artist/art director, Jose Soto.\r\n\r\nIf it was indeed
    based on Sloop's outlines (adding flourishes to an existing font) ... you could
    call it Customized, or you could call it a Type Treatment. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/todiefor_6120.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sloop1_3460.jpg]"
