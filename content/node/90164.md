body: "I designed this logo 30 years ago. I have recently contracted to the same client
  to update and also make two new brands utilizing this same style.\r\n\r\nI believe
  the font was either Letraset press type or a Linotype font.\r\n\r\nI can not seem
  to locate any typefaces that match the curves on the lower G serif, or the squat
  serifs of the lowercase letters. \r\n\r\nA close match might be Centaur but even
  that is not quite right.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Grillman_5086.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance for any help!"
