  body: Yes, there is something there, isn't there?  The bottom of the element is
    raised off the baseline, same with the b and d, and the corresponding element
    on the p and q are set below x height.  I didn't know if it could really work,
    but then someone posted about Serif Gothic and I noticed that it did it as well.

  body: No, I only came across that yesterday.  I was trying to figure out someway
    to suggest an element there without really having one. You can see my other experiments
    with this in the b, d, p and q.  I think actually I may make the a look more like
    the d.  I'll post some close up pics later.
