  used this font when creating labels for my daughters herb & spice business. Her
  computer had a virus & the \"so called\" techy removed the virus along with some
  files including this font which is used for hundreds of labels. \r\n\r\nI've tried
  URW but it's not listed but they hold the copyright.\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be greatly
  appreciated!"
