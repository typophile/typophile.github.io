  engaging and everlasting community. From my count, Typophile might possibly be the
  last bastion of civility on the Internet. That takes a lot of will-power, people.
  Of course our record isn't exactly spotless, but we do make attempts at keeping
  a pretty clear head before running the mouth off because of personal tastes or disagreements.
  \r\n\r\nOpinions and ideas are exchanged freely and without persecution or prejudice
  here and that's a marvel in this age. Granted, there aren't many heated debates
  that end in fisticuffs when related to typography.\r\n\r\nSo, I wanted to take a
  moment and thank everyone for being intelligent, patient and making Typophile a
  beautiful place to share thoughts and ideas without (too many) worries. It's what
  keeps me coming back .\r\n\r\nBravo."

    of themselves occasionally. Many times you write something thinking about it one
    way, but somebody else can read in a totally different way contrary to your intention.
    \r\n\r\nBut in most cases nobody here cares so much because the <em>ideas</em>
    are actually assessed rather than the person. \r\n\r\nAnd if not, theres always
    ATypI."

    but at the risk of moving the fracas over here, they are currently having an issue.
    Typophile has the advantage of being actively threaded, so you can avoid the contentious
    threads if you\u2019re not feeling that way inclined on a particular day, harder
    to ignore when the stuff floods your inbox. "

    resource. Though it is far from perfect like the people that use it. (shining
    example right here) I do find it disappointing when people resort to insults and
    bias but the worst thing that happens here is condescension. Typophile is for
    many kinds of people with different skill levels and educational and economic
    backgrounds. We need to keep this in mind when we see posts that have naive questions.
    Also, if there is something that another person is saying that is creating disagreement
    - 'attack' the issue not the person.\r\n\r\nI encourage those that have had a
    bad experience here to keep on posting and asking questions. Ignore the bad (people)
    and keep on learning.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

    daily occurance could be the Type ID Board. Even I've had moments when I thought,
    is this guy serious? Then, I'd refrain from posting what I really thought of the
    5 minutes I wasted reading their request and just answered the damned question.
    On other sites, I might not have been as patient or understanding. Typophile definitely
    has a calmer, gentler social community. "

    of just a few less pleasant or reasonable individuals who are quite outspoken.
    But I'll be the first to agree that 99% of Typophiles are great people to chat
    with.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
