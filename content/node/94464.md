body: "Hello all, \r\n\r\nI'm in the process of designing/building a font and It occurred
  to me that I don't know what best practices I should be following, if any. I'm sure
  everyone has their own preferences, but in general...what does your process look
  like? For example, here's what I have done so far: \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Sketched
  key font glyphs</li>\r\n<li>Scanned and drew glyphs in Illustrator (didn't have
  a font program yet)</li>\r\n<li>Bought a copy of Glyphs (love it) and imported all
  glyphs into the app.</li>\r\n<li>Added extended Latin characters, punctuation, and
  numerals. Printed, tweaked, printed, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Set side bearings (LSB and
  RSB) to 50 units on every glyph. A few glyphs have different side bearings, but
  99% of the font is set at 50.</li>\r\n<li>Set kerning classes on all upper/lowercase
  letters. Didn't do it on numerals or punctuation. </li>\r\n<li>Kerned all characters
  using multiple methods: [[http://logofontandlettering.com/kernking.html]] and ebensorkin's
  brute force test: [[http://typophile.com/node/30960]]</li>\r\n<li>Set some long
  text, printed and reviewed on screen</li>\r\n<li>\u2026and\u2026hated it. Deleted
  all kerning pairs \u2013\_started over.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nSo at this point, I'm
  feeling pretty stuck. I want to design multiple weights for the font, but I don't
  know if I should do that first, or kern the font <em>before</em> working on the
  other weights? What kerning method should I use? Should I set up kerning groups
  for punctuation and numerals? What is your process? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance! "

  body: This is something that I would be interested in seeing too. Because I've been
    reading this forum, I got the urge to buy typetool so I've been drawing in that
    (I heard it's like the baby FontLab Studio so the drawing tools should hopefully
    be similar if I ever upgrade). One thing I appreciate is the 'snapping' to units
    that you won't get in Illustrator by default, and I think I prefer it for drawing
    outlines than in Illustrator now (which I was more used to before).

    where 99% of the glyphs \"work\" with some fixed sidebearing value is probably
    not a usable font. Especially if your #2 involves auto-tracing, since that only
    really makes sense for letterforms with very organic/irregular outlines.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks hrant - perhaps you misunderstood. I didn't say it \"works\" with
    RSB and LSB at 50 (it doesn't). I just used 50 as a default. But your concern
    brings up a good question: Should I be setting the font's main spacing through
    side bearings or kerning pairs? I think the answer is to set spacing with side
    bearings wherever possible, and use kerning pairs only for specific issues (like
    AV). Is that right?\r\n\r\nAlso - no, I'm not auto-tracing the font. I've actually
    spent an inordinate amount of time tweaking, correcting, and perfecting the shapes
    in Glyphs. I used Illustrator at first because I hadn't bought Glyphs yet. \r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Yes, I did misunderstand - sorry.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between \"base
    spacing\" and kerning is more complex than it seems. The old maxim of \"space
    first, then kern\" isn't useless, in fact it might be a great way for a beginner
    to get a handle on spacing, but in the end it's limiting. All these steps in type
    design that seem discrete are in fact highly interdependent, but since they do
    have to be performed discretely they end up being highly iterative, with experience
    helping you save much iteration.\r\n\r\nSituations where kerning will be off are
    pretty much the same situations where users won't notice -and if they notice they
    won't much mind- if the spacing isn't just right. So there's a benefit to accounting
    for the eventual kicking-in of kerning when you're doing the spacing. And then
    there's the hidden truth that even the \"black bodies\" should be affected by
    spacing... and hence even kerning! For example one can't make a good lowercase
    /r in a space-less vacuum.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "oh good. that makes me feel better then because my instinct is to space and
    kern almost simultaneously. I was afraid I may be doing things out of sequence
    by doing that, so I kept resetting all the spacing/kerning and starting over.
    \r\n\r\nSo is there a 'best practice' for base spacing? \r\nFor kerning: is it
    better to kern using brute-force or kern king? \r\nIf I use one method (brute-force),
    should I not use the other (kern king)? Or is it a case of the more the merrier?
    \r\n\r\nWhat other 'best practices' should I be following? "
