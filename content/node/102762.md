  2008 and 2011 installed on a current MacBookPro ( so OS 10.8). \r\nThe letterhead
  template had been built for them (a Solicitor) some years ao using ITC Franklin
  Gothic, and checking  the text info in the letterhead template, this was what is
  still specified, although in Font Book variants named Franklin Gothic are listed.
  \r\n\r\nProblems arose after getting the new MBP and installing Office 2011. THe
  size of the Company Name in the letterhead form the template was larger , but also
  inconsistent. Inconsistencies were (presumably) fixed by some hard drive error repairs
  a,d flushing all caches ( using Onyx).\r\n\r\nThe residual problem is that there
  is a noticeable difference between the shape of the capital letter 'C'  as printed
  from there old MBP, and that printed from their new MBP. The old version  is less
  rounded and the gap between the 'jaws' of the letter C are quite different.  My
  familiarity with fonts and such are extremely limited ( as is probably apparent),
  being a database developer. \r\n\r\nI checked MS office site, and there appears
  to have been different 'versions' of the Franklin Gothic in office 2008 and later,
  but can not find equivalent info for 2011.  However, I am assuming  the diference
  in character (glyph?) shape(s) is something to do with versions of the Font. Is
  this correct?\r\n\r\nI have checked the font info using the text in the template
  , in the old and new MBP; the sizes, kerning etc are the same.\r\nCan the subtleties
  of the original  font be re-implemented? If this means purchasing a 3rd part copy
  of the required software this is no problem. The client is keen to maintain precise
  continuity of the appearance of there letterheads etc.\r\n\r\nIs ITC Franklin Gothic
  technically the same as Franklin Gothic? \r\n\r\n\r\nthanks for any suggestions\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No, they are not the same, technically or otherwise.\r\n\r\nFranklin Gothic
    originated as a foundry typeface first produced by American Type Founders (ATF)
    in the early 20th century. It only had one weight (fairly bold) with four different
    widths, some with italics.\r\n\r\nITC Franklin Gothic was a reworking of Franklin
    Gothic as a multi-weight family first released in 1980 by International Typeface
    Corporation (ITC). Besides having several weights, from Book to Heavy, it has
    a larger x-height and other design differences which had the effect of making
    it look more \u201Ccontemporary\u201D at the time it was released. A condensed
    width was added a bit later. More styles were added by Font Bureau more recently."

    body: "Ok, thanks.\r\n\r\nI had a look on the Linotype site, and the original
      letterhead ( i.e. from old MBP) looks like Condensed Book, while the current
      output (new MBP/Office 2011) looks like Book variant.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't yet
      understand is that the listed Franklin Gothic fonts are the same on both systems
      ( i.e. MacBooks), and that Fontbook lists Franklin Gothic, yet the Word template
      indicates ITC Franklin Gothic Book.\r\n\r\nIf it were just a matter of the template
      specifying ITC Franklin Gothic, and the system substituting Franklin Gothic
      as that is all it had, then the output should be the same on both computers.\r\n"
