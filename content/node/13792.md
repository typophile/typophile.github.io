  Computer Arts on what life for font designers is like at the moment - what do you
  guys think?\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Is it easy for font designers to sell work and make money
  - is it a good career move?\r\n\r\n2) Is there enough new blood coming into the
  industry?\r\n\r\n3) Do colleges and universities do a good enough job of getting
  students intersted in font design and helping them persue the art as a career? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDom

    design\". Typefaces are the letterform designs while fonts are merely the digital
    files that store them. Similarly, you wouldn't call a digital photographer a \"JPEG
    designer\". \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "\"1) Is it easy for font designers to sell work and make money - is it a
    good career move?\"\r\nMaking the move into type design is not only accomplished
    by springing up with an irresistable and original new design. There are other
    jobs too, but I a person is talented enough to start out with best sellers, yeah!
    it's a good career move. . \r\n\r\n\"2) Is there enough new blood coming into
    the industry?\"\r\nOver the last 10 years, I think there's been enough new blood
    to make a couple of Hollywood epics. New designers are coming into the industry
    in better shape than ever. \r\n\r\n\"3) Do colleges and universities do a good
    enough job of getting students intersted in font design and helping them persue
    the art as a career?\"\r\nSome do, and those send not just designers/ Other universities
    are not so thorough, but for the top 1% of potential type designers, it's the
    student, not the school. \r\n"

  body: "1) Is it easy for font designers to sell work and make money - is it a good
    career move?\r\n\r\nIt's very difficult to make all your income from type design.
    Many independent foundries are run by people with supplememtnal forms of income,
    such as graphic design and teaching. Many successful foundries don't rely on retail
    font sales, but on commissioned work. Starting out with a best seller, hmm, you
    may be a one-hit wonder! (But hopefully the royalties will last for a few years,
    subsidizing subsequent flops, and the reputation will lead to commissions.)\r\n\r\n2)
    Is there enough new blood coming into the industry?\r\n\r\nAll the time. Independent
    foundries have blossomed as a business sector, thanks to e-commerce.\r\n\r\n3)
    Do colleges and universities do a good enough job of getting students intersted
    in font design and helping them persue [sic] the art as a career?\r\n\r\nAs good
    as can be expected, given that it's a small industry. If you are looking to study
    type design, you will probably not find it as a separate course near you, and
    it is an oddity as part of a general design degree. There are very few places
    where type design can be studied in depth, such as the MA at Reading University."

  body: "I think Nick has it right. I don't think people go into type design for the
    money--designers go into it because they have a burning interest. If what you
    call a good career move is doing something that interests you then yes. If you
    think you will make Bill Gates jealous, then you will be disappointed.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Dom:\r\n\r\nI won't post anytinhg new here, but I think the insight of someone
    working at a Faculty (as a Design Technician) can probably add some factual data
    to your magazine feature.\r\n\r\n3)\r\nI work in a faculty in Porto, Portugal.
    It's a traditional Fine-Arts School.\r\nThe course is \"traditional\" Graphic
    Design oriented, having a strong multimedia component on the last 2 of a 5 year
    course. So as Nick said, to study Type Design in deph, here too is complicated:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"If
    you are looking to study type design, you will probably not find it as a separate
    course near you, and it is an oddity as part of a general design degree.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nActually,
    Type Design as a discipline, is integrated on the second year of the Graphic Design
    course and it can not be taught separately. It must stress that, on the second
    year, students also do composition and poster design. So it can be tricky for
    them to invest enough effort in this subject, and drawing, and history, and geometry,
    and...\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are some students who do persue Type Design
    as a \"personal quest\" all the way to the fith year and develop very interesting
    work.\r\n\r\nActually this last year there was a pretty valuable effort from one
    of the fourth year teachers to implement a Type Design assignment - Students were
    required to complete a working digital font from scratch. So many of them who
    had never used font software really had to take this on. The only problem here
    was that the school lacks the infrastructure to do this... maybe next year we'll
    be ready. This is due in part to the old traditional way of aproaching Type Design
    - Paper Drawings! I'm not against it, I still do them as a mandatory phase of
    Type developing, but the problem develops if you don't materialize your fonts
    and test them on real samples.\r\n\r\nSo, you can say that at least this Faculty
    (taking on account that this is a traditional school) is doing it's share <cite>on
    getting students intersted in font design and helping them persue the art as a
    career</cite>\r\n\r\nThis takes me to the other two questions. \r\n\r\n2)\r\nAt
    least here is very difficult to develop Type Design as a profession because there's
    a very small demand for it, and usually it's lettering. So the few that develop
    should really be enough to \"freshen the industry bood\". Altough... I really
    don't know this. My doubt comes from the last \"big clients\" like Funda\xE7\xE3o
    de Serralves, Grupo BPI and Grupo EDP. They all comissioned their work from international
    companies... so I think that, as a nation, we need to overcome our national prejudice
    first to stregthen our own industry.\r\n\r\n1)\r\nChris said it all!\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, which computer arts issue will your feature be on? I'd like to read it
    then!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPedro\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\r\n<a href=\"http://livetype.sourceforge.net\">LiveType
