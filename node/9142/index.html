  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">firstly pardon my english... <BR> <BR>I have been making fonts for 5 years. Two years ago I thought I was ready to sell them... two years later after endless kerning pairs and tweaks I am almost ready. So as I&#39;m building the site to sell them I&#39;ve come across a few questions...  <BR> <BR>As much we love type, even make them ourselves, and love to look at them... <BR> <BR>1.Does anyone regularly buy fonts?  <BR> <BR>2.How does anyone feel about the font prices? <BR> <BR>3.How many times did you need accent characters/special and they where not there? or made due <BR> <BR>4.How interested are you in non traditional but nice looking font design? ie the font &#34;enabler&#34; <BR> <BR>5.Anyone have experience selling fonts through a font house or sell them yourself? if so how was it <BR> <BR>Also any advise you can give would hugely appreciated? <BR>modestly thanx</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; 1.Does anyone regularly buy fonts? <BR> <BR>I have a nasty font licensing habit that I&#39;m doing my best to curb right now. <BR> <BR>&#62; 2.How does anyone feel about the font prices? <BR> <BR>The foundries from which I have licensed have fair pricing: Emigre, Font Bureau, FontShop, Hoefler&amp;Frere-Jones, Underware, House Industries .. all reasonable for the quality and customer service offered. I also use MyFonts which has again, I think, fair pricing for those foundries whom they represent. <BR> <BR>&#62; 3.How many times did you need accent characters/special and they where &#62; not there? or made due <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve become spoiled by full character sets. I really think you limit yourself by not including as many as you can. <BR> <BR>&#62; 4.How interested are you in non traditional but nice looking font &#62; design? ie the font &#34;enabler&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure I follow this question. <BR> <BR>&#62; 5.Anyone have experience selling fonts through a font house or sell &#62; them yourself? if so how was it <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t, but I think it will come down to how much time do you have to do your own marketing?</div>
