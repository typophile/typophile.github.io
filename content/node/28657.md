  body: "AllGiggles, since you seem to be writing from the UK, you may not be aware
    of the unique aesthetic that has developed amongst American college athletic logos.
    A perusal of the myriad designs at <a href=\"http://www.logoserver.com/College.html\">this
    site</a> will show you some of the trends that have developed -- bold, oblique,
    and high-contrast type (often with pointed serifs), everything on an angle, every
    mascot sneering, etc. There are some historical marks presented at the site (Alabama's
    all-smiles elephant from who-knows-when comes to mind) to give you a historical
    perspective, too.\r\n\r\nAs for official logos for colleges and universities,
    there does seem to be way too many marks that include <a href=\"http://www.und.edu/\">a
    torch</a> (signifying knowledge), <a href=\"http://www.northwestern.edu/\">complicated
    seals</a> (asserting legitimacy by harking back to European institutions), or
    (almost exclusively) serif type. \r\n\r\nSome institutions have worked hard to
    update their identities, often giving a modern facelift to their crests and seals
    (<a href=\"http://www.luc.edu/logo/about.shtml#\">Loyola Chicago</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cornell.edu/identity/\">Cornell</a>
    come to mind). \r\n\r\nMy institution, the University of Notre Dame, has done
    the same, recently updating their identity to include <a href=\"http://mark.nd.edu/\">this
    simplified mark</a>. However, it should be noted that the <a href=\"http://nd.edu/aboutnd/about/sights/images/wall_seal640.gif\">university
    seal</a> \u2014 a more complicated, historical version of what's seen in the new
    mark \u2014 is still used for official business and can be found many places on
    campus."

    of optical justification on 'UNIVERSITY' The right arm of the _Y_ is flush with
    the downstroke of the el in Drexel and therefore makes it feel like UNIVERSITY
    isn't wide enough on the right side.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Drex_6173.Logo.smallb.gif]"

  body: "They're not all boring, I quite like the Direct Gov example you cited, but
    I agree that Wigan college etc. ain't great.\r\n\r\nMy own beef with uni logos
    is the University of Nottingham - they had a great logo (I think The Chase designed
    it), and they've semi-introduced a watered-down version that takes a portion of
    the old logo and then replaces the beautiful typography with a couple of lines
    of Dax. The clincher is that they had a new building made in the last few years,
    and the signage on the entrance still bears the previous logo. So, their marketing
    department have created a de-personalised, bland, modern-looking logotype to represent
    a red-brick university steeped in heritage. Nice one. (There are 2 unis in Nottingham,
    the other is an old poly which has, incidentally, rebranded to appear more established).\r\n\r\nIt
    comes down to design by committee, and letting everyone in the place have their
    say on it... I can see why it happens, but you would think that a marketing department
    should really know better.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/before_5843.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/after_4326.gif]"
