body: I&#39;ve searched for these but can&#39;t find who sells them. They appear to
  be extensively in embroidery so I assume that there is an electronic version - any
  help would be great. <BR> <BR>Mark <BR>FontSurfer.com <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49567.jpg"

  body: Letterhead Fonts has a free download version similar to Pro Block. Although
    one difference is that the Z is not champfeured in the same way as your sample.
    Look at the <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/downloads/index.shtml" target="_blank">Old
    Block</a> Series
