    included.\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=44276\r\nYou may require
    both the italic and swash italic fonts to get all the needed glyphs.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No, Adobe's version does not have the swash alternates. That's why I posted
    the link to the Monotype/ITC site, fonts.com. Adobe licenses the typeface from
    Monotype/ITC, who recently made the swash alternates available in digital form.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
