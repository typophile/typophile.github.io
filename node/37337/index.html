<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi All
I have to create from scratch a Unicode windows compatible font embedding (predefined) bitmaps. I have been asked to use the BitFonter tool to perform this job. As far as I have well understood in the BitFonter user guide, this software should be the right one to perform such a job. So, following the User guide advices, I have created a brand new font and copied/pasted all my bitmaps in the corresponding characters. Then I have saved the result in a "OpenType SBIT (bitmap)Font (*.ttf)" file.
But, if I preview the resulting file using the MS-Windows preview (double click on the ttf file from a windows explorer) all the characters are rendered win a "."
I have spent a lot of time messing around all the parameters related to the font in BitFonter but it drew a blank. Always "." are displayed !
I have spent an e-mail to the FontLab support, providing by ttf file and they replied that the outline was empty! But I was not intent to create outline since I wanted to embed bitmaps.
I thought if should be a very straightforward job but it doesn't look.
Is there somebody confortable with this tool who can advice me?
Thank everybody for your help.

<div class=commentbody>I wonder if that windows font preview can even render bitmaps. I think it uses vector rendering. Have you already tried just installing and testing the font?</div>

<div class=commentbody>At least in the testing phase I would include outlines - perhaps some quite different from the bitmaps. Might also want to look at Calibri and Cambria in Vista which include embedded bitmaps at key sizes - maybe diffing against your font. Finally don't forget to turn off ClearType and all antialiasing when testing the font.

<div class=commentbody>Keep in mind that since the bitmaps are embedded into the font at a particular ppm size, you'll only see your bitmaps when you call that ppm size.
When I use the MS-Windows preview (Win XP)on a font I have with bitmaps, I can see bitmaps at 12ppm in the 3rd section that shows the Ascii characters, at 16ppm for the 12 point sample, and at 24ppm for the 18 point sample. (Remember that bitmaps are embedded at ppm size, and the sizes listed in the preview are point sizes)
If your bitmaps are embedded at another size besides 12,16 or 24, you won't see them in the Windows preview.
You should install the font in Windows, then try to type a few characters in Notepad or Word, using your font. As Si noted, "don’t forget to turn off ClearType and all antialiasing when testing the font" and remember that you're specifying a point size in the app, so you need to spec the right point size to hit the ppm size you embedded:
(point size * 96) / 72 = ppm size used.

<div class=commentbody>Hi All
Thanks a lot for your prompt replies!
Here are my font configuration:
Point size = 11 points
Pixel size = 15 pixels
Resolution = 96x96
With these figures, the Windows font preview displays only dots, whatever the size is.
If I assign this font to a string in WordPad for example, only dots are displayed (whatever the size).
Actually, the embedded bitmaps fit in a bounding box of 15 pixels height. That's the reason why I assigned the Pixel size to 15.
ClearType & Antialiasing are turned off.

As I mentioned, With bitmaps embedded at 15ppm, you should not see them in Windows font preview.
If you've installed the font, using Wordpad, calling the correct characters, you should see them at 11point.
If not, then something is probably wrong with your font, but it could be lots of things; character encodings, bitmap embeddings, settings, etc. Does the font pass Font Validator?
