body: Hey everyone, it's been a while since I posted here. I'm looking for clever
  typography in Flash animations. Short movies where the text plays a prominent role
  and interacts visually with the images/animations. Letters morphing into shapes
  might be an example of what I'm looking for. Animations where type is the key element.
  Please share any examples you have. Thanks.
