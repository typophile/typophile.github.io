    try making it 10pt shorter and see what happens. I'm designing a PRO version with

    Google Web Fonts collection :)"

  body: "Unless you see it as a newspaper/magazine font, the descenders are not too
    long, the ascenders are too short (BTW, they shouldn't be the same length). It
    is nice to see a font that doesn't have descenders that look like a withered limb.
    Just fix the proportions. (BTW2, the ascenders can be taller than the cap height.)\r\n
    \r\nSadly, Without a companion italic, it is of no use to a number of us..."

  body: "<blockquote>they shouldn't be the same length</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's
    pretty much what I meant (\"compared to the ascenders\"). But although the fitting
    is too tight for a news face (not the same as a magazine face) the color -which
    is much harder to adjust- fits that usage, and that's why I gravitated to seeing
    this as a news face... which means the descenders are too long. If Fernando does
    lengthen the ascenders instead, he can keep the tightness, but then the color
    will be too dark (barring peculiar taste).\r\n\r\nIt might be nice to gawk at
    pretty descenders, but immersive reading is quite removed from such deliberative
    enjoyment. Especially in a news face linespacing plays a huge role in optimal
    vertical proportions, necessarily at the expense of letterwise beauty. Or: it's
    beauty on another level.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>the ascenders can be taller than the
    cap height</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhich they currently are. But if the descenders
    are made longer the caps will probably need to go up too...\r\n\r\nErgo: the shortest
    route to making this more usable is shortening the descenders, and shooting for
    small size setting.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant,\r\n\r\nYou can't really judge a typeface outside it's use; either
    pixels on a screen or ink on paper. I have no expertise with pixels on a screen,
    but (sadly) over 30 years with ink on paper, spanning several printing technologies,
    and many  kinds of paper.\r\n\r\nCutting to the chase, for printing on a coated
    sheet as with an art book, I think the font will have about the right weight.
    I'm reminded of Merlo, too heavy for an uncoated sheet, but  attractive on coated
    stock. The font has enough understated elegance to work for illustrated books,
    too. Not all of them of course, but that's the argument for having more than just
    a few fonts.\r\n\r\nWith the leading typically used today, slightly longer ascenders
    would easily be accommodated. Were it my font design, I'd play with just slightly
    lengthening the ascenders first, and leaving the caps alone.  This would allow
    for skipping small caps -- a heresy for those who only read rules and can't use
    their eyes, I know. But it might work with this font.\r\n\r\nStill, the lack of
    an italic makes it all moot for me."

  body: "<blockquote>slightly longer ascenders would easily be accommodated</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    believe it's not really about \"accommodating\" (i.e. descenders of one line not
    touching the ascenders of the next line) it's about efficient use of space, especially
    in terms of maximizing apparent leading (hence the ability to lengthen lines without
    impeding reading). The space wasted by overly long descenders can be used to make
    the x-height and/or ascenders more visible. It's basically wasted functional potential,
    with very little practical aesthetic gain.\r\n\r\nYou don't know how your font
    is going to be used. Sometimes it won't matter, but if a user pushes the vertical-space
    limits the font will not deliver what it could have if the descenders weren't
    so long.\r\n\r\nAnd why do the lion's share of text fonts have ascenders longer
    than descenders, even though: making them equal is the most intuitive thing to
    do; or making the descenders longer allows them to elaborate their more complex
    structures better?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>skipping small caps</blockquote>\r\n\r\nReducing
    the need for, sure; skipping entirely, no. Long acronyms are not uncommon these
    days, and fullcaps that are small enough to make those acceptable would be too
    small to function well in capitalization.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Fenix, it's really a web font (will be available in Google Web Font collection
    soon). That's why it doesn't have an italic yet and the ascender/descender are
    fixed for this purpose. You are 100% right about the use, it's still doesn't have
    much besides titles for web.\r\n\r\nBut, I'm comming up with a PRO version for
    books and newspapers, with proper italics and smcp's. This is going to take a
    while, becouse I must test it on printed surface, make the correct kerning, etc...\r\n\r\nSo
    I hope you'll see it soon as a typeface for print.\r\nRegards! :)"
