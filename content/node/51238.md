  french folds and so i only had to consider using one side of the paper.\r\n  Now
  i want to create another small booklet that uses both sides of the paper. \r\nWhen
  making spreads in InDesign, will the spread 4-5 automatically be printed on the
  back of spread 2-3?  "

    to a commercial printer?\r\n\r\nIf it's the former, go to the help section and
    search for \"booklet.\" It'll tell you about how to use the Print Booklet command.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's the latter, your printer will take care of the page imposition."
