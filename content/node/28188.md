  body: "You're right Patty -- good eye! That A is borrowed from something like Commercial
    Script, or Typo Script (which has been revived). It seems to have been a practice
    by some 'cloners' to mix one letter from a different font, or modify one letter,
    so that they can say it's not an exact copy. Maybe that's what this is, but it
    is basically York Script (Solotype Catalog, p. 96)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
