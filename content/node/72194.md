  body: "Thanks guys... I appreciate you trying despite the lack of info.\r\n\r\nCoquette
    is actually very similar in flavor to this. The major difference is (which I failed
    to mention) the letters should are connected.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\nS"

  body: "You can also try using the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\">Script
    Font ID Guide</a>. If the letters connect, look at either Part 1, or Part 7, depending
    on whether you think the script is a formal, or casual style. If the letters are
    not all connected then check Parts 2, or 8, again depending on whether you consider
    the style formal or casual.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
