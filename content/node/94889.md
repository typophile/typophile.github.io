  local supermarket)? I've been messing around with font detectors all day and none
  of the machine/automated methods will give me a close match. The closest What The
  Font gave me were Code Pro, Avenir Medium and Skyler while Identifont gave me Alinea
  Sans. Close but not identical. I was hoping someone might have seen this font somewhere
  to give me an accurate name.\r\n\r\n*I've got many 'regular' samples (not sure if
  bold or if the large print gives the impression of bold), none of them are italic
  (the slant in the photos above is just from camera angle).\r\n\r\n*Not sure if this
  font family has an upper case at all since its user only used lower case\r\n\r\n*Sorry
  but couldn't find any words with the letters 'y', 'q' or 'j', which surely would
  be useful in identification. I'll look for some words with those letters the next
  time I go.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
