  scanned images of vintage books on calligraphy and penmanship: http://www.iampeth.com/books.htm
  \r\n\r\nToday I was contacted by a typographer that would like to create a couple
  of fonts from some images on our website, that were originally published in a book:
  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.iampeth.com/books/dennis_pen_art/dennis_pen_art_page27.html\r\nhttp://www.iampeth.com/books/dennis_pen_art/dennis_pen_art_page28.html\r\n\r\nThe
  artwork in the book was created by W.E. Dennis, and published in 1914 by the A.N.
  Palmer Company.\r\n\r\nIf we agree to provide high-resolution scans of these pages
  to aid this typographer in his creation, could IAMPETH (the owner of the website)
  be liable at all?  Would we be violating any type of copyright laws?\r\n\r\nI would
  be very grateful for any advice you could offer.\r\n\r\nTrying to do the right thing,\r\n\r\nJames
  Ivey\r\nDallas, Texas\r\n"

    providing any specific rights or permissions regarding how they could be used,
    only how they can't be used. So I guess what i'm asking is under what terms do
    you provide the scans?\r\n"

  body: "Hi sii.  Thanks for responding.\r\n\r\nWow.  Haven't even considered that.
    \ Since we (IAMPETH) don't own the copyright for the book or the artwork, it didn't
    even occur to me to consider terms of use.\r\n\r\nI guess part of the dilemna
    is, since we don't own the copyrights, is it even our permission to give?\r\n\r\nIf
    he (the typographer) were breaking any laws by creating and selling the font,
    would we (IAMPETH) be getting ourselves into hot water by providing the scans?
    \ kind of like \"aiding and abetting\" a law-breaker... that kind of thing."

    it matters, but the images/website is hosted in the United States, and the typographer
    is in Germany.  The book was published here in the U.S.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for
    the link.  Good stuff."

  body: "\r\nJames, I think your totally safe in providing the scans, but it does
    seem strange that the type designer is asking your permission to make a font from
    them. Like buying a gun and asking permission of the gun shop owner to go shoot
    tin cans off a fence. \r\n"

  body: "Thanks sii.  He's really not asking for our permission, he's just asking
    for some high resolution scans.  We've got the original book, and he needs high-res
    images to start creating his font.  We just want to make sure that we (IAMPETH)
    are not exposing ourselves legally by helping him make his fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm like
    you though... I think we're safe.  I'm ready to go for it, but we've got cooler
    heads than mine that are expressing concern."

    on this particular book.  We figured it was public domain since it was printed
    in 1914."
