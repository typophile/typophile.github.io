  good, elegant design (let alone any that harness \"web 2.0\" features like dynamic
  cart updating, etc. etc.) \r\n\r\nI really like boomkat.com\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know
  of any other really well designed stores?"

  body: I've found the less 'web 2.0'-ish a store is, the more usable it is.

  body: oh yeah--if we're talking superficial "web 2.0" design elements. There's so
    much potential for using that kind of technology to make shopping carts better/easier/quicker
    to use, though.
