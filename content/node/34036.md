  system using the same font throughout. There's a free lookalike font available at
  http://www.haroldsfonts.com/metro.html and here are some photos I found on the Web:

  \r\n\r\nDoes anybody know the actual name of the font and who has designed it, and
  when? \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nMichael"

  body: "The Mexico City metro sinage was designed by Lance Wyman, who also designed
    the Mexico 68 Olympic sinage.\r\n\r\nYou can visit his website at lancewyman.com
    where there are some samples of the sinage created for many of his projects, including
    the Mexico City Metro.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if he also designed the font, but I
    hope that may atleast help you find some more information on it."
