  anyone seen something like this before?\r\nMy Safari version is 3.2.3 (5525.28.3)"

  body: Is this triggered by a font manager? Or is someone using @fontface and is
    this Safari's way of ensuring that you know about it? And no, I don't recall ever
    seeing that dialogue before.

  body: I think that is the dialogue for the "font auto-activation" feature of OS
    X 10.5.  In theory it means fonts that are on your machine can be activated for
    a particular purpose even though they have not been "installed" in any of the
    Fonts folders, or are there but "deactivated."  As I understand it the feature
    does not work that well....

    seen this because I use Firefox with OS X 10.5.7, rather than Safari."

  body: 'Despite all the <A HREF="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Mac+OS+X+font+exploit&form=QBLH">documented</A>
    OS X font exploits, Safari will download and temporarily install fonts from the
    wild wild Web, but asks permission to temporarily install a font located on your
    hard disk? Seems just a little arse-backwards to me. '

  body: "OK, so it sounds like it shows up when a font is requested by a web page,
    and the font file lives somewhere in the drive but it's not installed. Is that
    right?\r\n\r\nBut what exactly triggers the dialog? A CSS <code>font-family</code>
    property?"
