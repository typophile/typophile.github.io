  Anyone here got any impressions? How does it perform while managing thousands of
  fonts, for example? Is it fast? Does it have some kind of possibility to spot duplicates
  and deactivate them?\r\n\r\nbr,\r\ntobias\r\n\r\n"

    take on font management and now that FontShop is involved I expect the development
    to pick up pace and add some very desirable features.\r\nBTW The possibele use
    of 3rd party plug-ins seems to be an innovation that none of the other fm\u2019s
    don\u2019t have.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
