  working on.\r\nWhy do they exist? I think they should be converted to vectors in
  FL when the BCPs ain\xB4t there.\r\nAnybody know of a script o get rid of them quickly?"

  body: "You can only remove control points if both BCPs <cite>within a curve segment</cite>
    are retracted.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure if this is what you meant. Note that it is
    always two BCPs that belong to one curve segment \u2013 the notion that the two
    BCPs on one node belong together is wrong.\r\n\r\nIn case both BCPs of a curve
    are retracted (i.e., it is in fact a straight line) you may be able to solve this
    quickly by using the remove overlap function.\r\n\r\nBtw, there does not seem
    to be anything technically wrong with retracting one BCP within a curve. You may
    encounter problems when converting them to TrueType curves, though."

  body: "This is typically something that designers want to control easily. Because
    FM is in the first placed developed for internal use here at DTL, we constantly
    try to improve and simplify the behavior of the BE and IK editors. The consequence
    is that the wish list is always growing, of course. Recent improvements for instance
    include the placing of (magnetic) guide lines by simply clicking on points and
    the enhanced control over BCP's.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bcp_example_1_4542.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    the first versions of FM removing Control points naturally resulted in a straight
    line between two adjacent (Smooth) Anchor points. It took some discussion to convince
    the programmers that in the design process we also could use an option for directly
    placing Control points on the Anchor points, without the necessity to use the
    coordinates editor (illustration 1). \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bcp_example_2_6595.gif]\r\n\r\nAt
    the end the solution was to place the Control points on the Anchor points by simply
    \u2018deleting\u2019 the BCP's (illustration 2) and to use the \u2018Change Label\u2019
    option for the conversion from curve to line and vice versa (illustration 3).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bcp_example_3_6068.gif]\r\n"
