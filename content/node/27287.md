body: "Hi. I was hoping to get some advice from people with much more expertise on
  this subject than me. I am a publisher for a small trade magazine (circ 16,000)
  that caters to the floor covering industry. Basically, the magazine is read by retailers
  who sell carpet, vinyl, wood, ceramic, etc. It is of the 11 x 17 size and is composed
  of text, photos of people and products, maybe a few charts. When I arrived a little
  more than 6 months ago a redesign was one of my top priorities, as describing the
  look as archaic and a mess would be an understatement. The former graphic designer
  would employ five headline fonts on the cover, not to mention different fonts for
  decks. Some work has been done in the war room, but nothing that will see the light
  of day. So my question is whether anyone can recommend some fonts that may be appropriate
  for this magazine, particularly body copy. I am looking for something fresh, clean,
  contemporary. Anything will be an improvement, but I'd also like to blow people
  away while not going exceptionally radical. I have heard the fonts Miller and Whitman
  tossed around, but I don't know. Any thoughts would be much appreciated. \r\nThanks,\r\nSteve"

    have a look at my foundry and see if you find any of them appropriate for this
    task? Let me know if you have additional questions?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com\r\n\r\nCheers"

    work with. It might take a couple of weeks to get the hang of it:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens.html?key=bannerfam&thename=Freight&link=T&formsubmit=T\r\n\r\nThe
    Mac Rhino text faces look very nice, thanks for bringing these to my attention.
    Bookmarked!"
