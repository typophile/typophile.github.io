  I am really dependent on Interpolate node in fontlab, and I am wondering, does such
  a thing exist in Illustrator CC either natively or as a plugin?\r\n\r\n\r\nJdooley"

  body: "I've played around with it, and will say you can use Object > Blend to achieve
    interpolation. You can also specify the number of steps you want so you will end
    up being able to choose which one you like the best.\r\n\r\nThe downside? Unless
    you are super-attentive to making sure your two masters are node compatible, it
    will probably only work one character at a time without making a huge mess of
    things. I never tried it with multiple characters.\r\n\r\nIt just occurred to
    me that I should have tried it with three in-line masters; that might be interesting."
