  body: "Sort of.\r\n\r\n<cite>Ella Deloria's The Buffalo People</cite> by (with?)
    Julian Rice, published by the University of New Mexico Press, available at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Ella-Delorias-Buffalo-People-Deloria/dp/0826315070\r\n\r\nTypographically
    speaking, I remember setting this book. It was set before PostScript fonts, using
    a Linotron 202. What is significant here is that I was limited by characters available
    for the 202, and movement of characters limited by the 202 -- not TeX, but the
    L-202, then called an \"output device.\"\r\n\r\nWe could do a much better job
    today -- at least, if we used a font where the EULA permitted modifications to
    create custom diacriticals.\r\n\r\nTypography aside, at the end of the book is
    an appendix showing two different orthographies for rendering Lakota in written
    form using the Latin alphabet."
