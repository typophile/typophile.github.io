      Roman, but the T and R have different serif tails... They only go left, not
      left and right.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions you may have would be very much
      appreciated!"

  body: "1985 is on the cusp of the desktop-publishing era, so this might not be a
    digital typeface. It's close enough to University Roman that it is quite possible
    that no one has digitized it.\r\n\r\nI probably also out to point out that chopping
    off a couple if serifs isn't too difficult a task."

    the original design, as they are created by well known font forgery companies.\r\nI
    'll mention them here, hoping that somebody can find the original:\r\nSagittal
    - no foundry info\r\nChickadee - no foundry info\r\nPiquet SSi - Southern Software,
    1992\r\nPiquetSSK - Southern Software, 1992\r\nLondon - Brendel Informatik GmbH,

  body: I think the "original" for this was Fontbank's Chickadee - which was, of course,
    a modification of University Roman. Fontbank's offerings were all modifications
    of existing fonts.

  body: "I agree Mike. \r\nFontbank's Chickadee has a copyright claim of 1990-1991.
    So the other versions are copies of Fontbank's hack of University Roman. Fairly
    well done, for a hack. If it had been another font maker I might have looked for
    a photo lettering rework of University Roman as a pre-digital source.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
