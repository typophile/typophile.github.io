  the original Belwe antiqua.\r\nAnyone any idea?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_5704.jpg]"

  body: The g appears to be from Cheltenham. Maybe someone just didn't like the g

  body: I've been working on this one with ro18s, and concluded that it might be a
    derivative work from the early twentieth century by a Dutch foundry, but my source
    material from the Netherlands is very slim...
