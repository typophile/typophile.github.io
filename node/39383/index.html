<p>Thanks to Antonio for the great feedback. In response to what you said:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The proportions are definitely not accurate. Shadowcliffe is only partially based on Trajan, as opposed to being a direct replica/revival. So I&rsquo;m still taking plenty of artistic liberties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The S is indeed wider by design; as much as I love the original Trajan S, I wanted Shadowcliffe to be a little more versatile, and as a result things like the ultra-narrow S have been adjusted for greater consistancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The J, K and R terminals did in fact &ldquo;swell&rdquo; too much. I was trying to give some of the standard glyphs a slightly more swash-like character, but as much as I like the idea I was going for, the execution never quite worked out. So I&rsquo;ve reverted them to a more standard design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The X was unintentionally top-heavy and should be fixed now.</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like it, well produced and balanced (probably <!-- raw HTML omitted -->because<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of things like the &lsquo;S&rsquo; being wider than it is in Trajan and such).</p>
<p>Only thing I don&rsquo;t like &ndash; which I also don&rsquo;t like in Trajan (amongst other things) &ndash; are the serifless tops of the &lsquo;M&rsquo; and &lsquo;N&rsquo;. I understand that the historical precedents have this as well, but I think it makes them look as if they don&rsquo;t belong in the set.</p>
<p>I like the &lsquo;R&rsquo;, the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t connect to the stem, and the leg as well.
The weight distribution could use some attention, but only here and there. For example compare the diagonal of the &lsquo;N&rsquo; with the spine of the &lsquo;S&rsquo;. But also the bowl of the &lsquo;D&rsquo; compared to those of the &lsquo;C&rsquo;/&lsquo;G&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s only minor, but nevertheless. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the comments. Funny how subjective this stuff can be: The missing serifs on the M and N are among my favorite aspects of the Trajan characters, and one of the reasons I chose it as an inspiration. :)</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also right about the weight issues&ndash; I noticed the S vs. N problem shortly after uploading the PDF, and have since fixed it. I also always knew there was something up with the C/G vs. D thing, but you&rsquo;ve prompted me to take a more formal look at it and actually do something about it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, just a difference in opinion, but those characters are one reason why I don&rsquo;t use Trajan. Well&hellip; mainly the fact that it has been used to death on movieposters, but ok. ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Phew! Turns out the last character set was anything but finished. :) I just did another complete overhaul, doing a lot of very brutal testing, viewing test strings from a distance, from weird angles, etc:</p>
<p>NOW, I think I might finally be ready to wrap up the character set. I did a lot of work across all of the weights/strokes/stresses, and made a rather bold change in the size of the bowls on the R, P and Thorn&ndash; they&rsquo;re considerably larger now, giving the face quite a bit more character than it had originally. They&rsquo;re so big they almost remind me of Goudy Old Style or something. But this is a titling font, and I think it makes sense. As part of my move away from the strangely narrow characters found in the Roman Trajan capitals, such as R, P and S, I think this to some degree inescapable.</p>
<p>I should be able to knock out the rest of this weight within a few days, assuming I don&rsquo;t once again decide to redo the damn capitals. :) Here&rsquo;s what I plan on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Union of WinANSI + MacOS Roman characters</li>
<li>Small caps for lowercase</li>
<li>Both lining and old-style figures (lining will be default, as this is a title font)</li>
<li>Complete set of numerators/denominators for OpenType fractions</li>
<li>Select swash capitals</li>
<li>Flourish ornaments</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll at the very least be adding a considerably heavier bold weight, and possibly a light weight on top of that.</p>
