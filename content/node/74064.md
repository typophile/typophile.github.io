body: "I need to create an icon that can be understood by speakers of many languages.
  I'm thinking of incorporating an exclamation point, but I'm wondering how universal
  it is. According to wikipedia:\r\n\r\n \"The exclamation mark is common to languages
  using the Latin alphabet, although usage varies slightly between languages. The
  exclamation mark is also used in languages with other scripts, such as Greek, Russian,
  Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.\"\r\n\r\nIt mentions Arabic, but what
  about any of the other languages of the Middle East?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of
  any languages (not counting languages spoken in undeveloped areas) that don't use
  the exclamation point (and if they use a substitute, what is it)?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    people on the world. Even something simple like the arrow \u2192 is ambiguous
    -- the \"Warning: Laser\" icon uses it in a reversed form.\r\n\r\nLatin, Greek,
    Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Korean and Japanese -- with both first- and
    second language speakers --, to how many people does that add up? Who are you
    afraid of missing out on? Cherokee, Amaya, Aussie Aboriginals?"

    up in front of the viewer's face in a \"Stop right there & go no further.\" gesture
    is often used in countries with low literacy rates.\r\n\r\nHowever, the exclamation
    mark is very widely used as a caution symbol on packaging and signs meant to be
    trans-lingual."

    hand gesture.

  body: In at least one southern African alphabet, the exclamation sign is a consonant
    letter, indicating a retroflex click.

    reportedly offensive in some countries (essentially the same as giving someone
    the finger in the US)."

  body: "Thanks for the input! It looks like the exclamation point would be recognizable
    in all the geographic areas I need to deal with, but I'm probably going down the
    wrong alley, since the exclamation point is so widely used as a caution symbol.\r\n\r\nThe
    symbol I'm trying to create needs to say \"I need help!\" and I was thinking that
    the exclamation point could serve that purpose, but since it's already commonly
    used for something else, it probably wouldn't be a good choice."
