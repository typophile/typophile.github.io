  for quite some time.  I am working on a t-shirt design that is based on the Jim
  Beam Black ad campaign.  I am mostly finished with my design, but I NOT satisfied
  with the font that I have come up with.  Here is the Jim Beam ad and my design side
  by side.\r\n \r\n\r\nand please ignore the typo :)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  body: Hmmm. It looks like Texas Christian University Delta Tau Delta's "commitment"
    is to drinking (Jim Beam).

  body: "I wasn't referring to the misspelling. Numerous incidents around the country
    involving fraternities and drinking have resulted in hospitalization, death, jail
    time, expulsion, and the shutting down of fraternities.\r\n\r\nI hope your fraternity
    does nothing foolish in that regard. But if something should happen, you have
    already suggested (if not gone on record) that Delta Tau Delta is committed to
    drinking, thus increasing your liability.\r\n\r\nI have nothing against responsible
    drinking, but linking your fraternity (even by a T-shirt) to drinking doesn't
    seem like a good idea to me. Also, copying a company's brand identity is neither
    original nor creative."
