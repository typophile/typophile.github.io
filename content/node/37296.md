  decorating brochures and generally making anything look awesome.\r\n\r\nI've to
  compose a journal for my placement year to keep my lecturers happy, and I want to
  make it as outstanding as possible. However, coming across free vectors is like
  finding gold dust. \r\n\r\nIn my moment of despiration, I turn to you typophiles
  in search of some eclectic vector formats for use in print.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPaul."

    you have CS2, there is a feature called Live Trace similar to Streamline that
    can vectorize the .tif files. (I just read this, so I can't give you details)"

    have tons of cheap ($1 - $4) vector files like that. Search for the same descriptive
    words you used above.

    once you have it in vector format (or as far as I've found anyway).\r\n\r\nIt
    has a setting for vectoring raster versions of type though - piracy anyone?"

    and some of the options work better than others, no substitute for starting from
    scratch and beziering it up though (sorry for that verb), certainly unimpressive
