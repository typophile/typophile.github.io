  In Illustrator is there a way to have more control over the control handles than
  just the &#34;click and drag&#34; method? Can you specify the distance or location,
  similar to how you can move points in the &#34;transform&#34; panel? Thanks!

  body: Thanks for your reply Andriy. I&#39;m talking about the bezier handles, directional
    points, BCP&#39;s, whatever you call them. Do you mean I could set up precise
    guides that I could snap the handles to? That does work, but I&#39;d rather transform
    the bezier handles themselves. With my little experience with Fontlab, it looks
    like you can do what I want to do - in the node properties and the BCP checkbox.
    So far I&#39;ve been creating the glyphs in illustrator and pasting them into
    fontlab, because i&#39;m a little a more familiar with Illustrator. Is that bad
    practice?

    I think that FontLab makes drawing glyphs easier because there you can see the
    coordinates of all the points &#40;including BCPs&#41; and thus control them precisely.
    Also, all the coordinates are integers there, so there is no chance to be &#39;a
    little inaccurate&#39;

  body: Matt, <BR>I also started out drawing glyphs in AI but quickly gave it up.
    The way FontLab curves spring out instead of collapse in &#40;like AI&#41; makes
    glyph drawing much easier.  You can also select a control handle in FontLab and
    use the up-down and left-right arrows of the keyboard to nudge the handles in
    exact units.  If you add the option key, the nudge is 10 units instead of 1. If
    I were you I would jump into drawing in FontLab and abandon AI as a font drawing
    program.  You will quickly grasp the nuances of FontLab and soon be glad you made
    the switch.  I have also noticed that AI nodes and joins sometimes behave strangely
    when pasted into FontLab.  This can cause peculiarities when making transformations.  AI
    is a great drawing tool and I use it every day but it is not the best glyph drawing
    program. Fear not, jump in; the water is warm :-&#41; <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    I&#39;ve seen so far...

  body: Matt,  <BR> <BR>I recomend checking out Leslie Cabarga&#39;s book &#34;Learn
    FontLab Fast&#34; &#40;<a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com" target="_blank">http://www.logofontandlettering.com</a>
    &#41;, esp. pages 50-57. On these four spreads, Leslie managed to pack the essentials
    of glyph drawing in FontLab in a highly informative, concise and yet very understandable
    manner.  <BR> <BR>Even though I was technical editor for the book, I still keep
    learning from it every time I re-read or re-browse it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
