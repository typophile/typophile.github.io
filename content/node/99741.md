  relax.  Some of us don't want to just get away from it all, but we also want to
  get away from it all without sacrificing sustainable development.  \r\n\r\nThe environment
  is always an important factor in our lives, so how can we figure out a way to get
  our rest and recreation while promoting minimal environmental damage?  One way to
  do it would be to take public transportation while you are at your vacation destination.
  \ \r\n\r\nMany popular destinations offer various types of public transportation,
  and it is becoming more progressive in plenty of major cities.  Leave the car at
  home and save on gas and parking fees, all while giving the environment a break.
  \ Another tip would be to eat locally. \r\n\r\nFind out where the farmer's markets
  are and stock up.  Eat at the local restaurants and support small businesses.  Resist
  the advertisements to eat at the popular chain restaurants.  Bring up the global
  economy.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.best-resume-templates.com\">http://www.best-resume-templates.com</a>"
