  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In the currently running thread ostensibly about 'New MS Type for 2006', but seemingly about grinding some rather ancient axes, a lot of stuff has been written about Microsoft's new ClearType Font Collection, almost all of if by people who have never used the fonts, have no access to tools that would allow them to test the fonts under the rendering system for which they were designed, and have apparently only seen screenshots on a third-party website. <BR> <BR>In this thread, with the exception of this introductory text, I do not intend to write very much. Rather, I will post, as my schedule permits, images that will give a better idea of some of the CT fonts in use in the environment for which they were designed. I should stress that even these images give a poor idea of how well the fonts perform, unless you happen to have an identical monitor to mine and like your CT rendering tuned the way I like mine tuned. I suspect that most of you will have a lower resolution screen than mine, so the graphics will appear larger on your screens than on mine. This means, among other things, that the colour fringing of the CT rendering will be more obvious on your screen than mine, since the individual pixels are larger. I will include some absolute measurement, e.g. width of graphic in millimetres on my screen, in the caption of each graphic. [Note, the captions of graphics may be set in Photoshop, as in the first image, so will not themselves be examples of CT rendering.] <BR> <BR>I will not take part in any thread to which Bill Troop contributes, so hopefully he won't kill this thread by voicing opinions here. If he wants to continue slagging fonts and the people who make them, he can do so in the other thread to his heart's content. Everyone else is encouraged to ask questions that I can try to answer visually. If there are particular kinds of settings you would like to see, particular type sizes, background colours, etc., please let me know. I hope the images will be helpful to making up your own mind about these fonts, but I maintain that the real time to judge these fonts will be when Longhorn ships and people actually start using them. <BR> <BR>One final note, where I label an image as 'Longhorn CT rendering' this is actually output from a test app using the Longhorn APIs running under Windows XP. This test app does not, currently, employ the y-direction antialiasing of the Longhorn renderer, so I will limit such examples to typical text sizes. I can post some display size examples from another test application, but this will not show sub-pixel positioning. <BR> <BR> <BR>PS. If nothing else, this thread might convince some people of the near impossibility of forming a valuable judgement of screen typography via screenshots. I just looked at the images below on a 96dpi screen, and they look worse than I feared. Live text on your own screen is the only way to judge these things at all well, and even then you are likely to learn as much about the limitations of your screen as you are about the qualities of the type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some informal observations: <BR> <BR>The biggest difference I can see in the way CT renders text compared to OSX (Panther) is in the way horizontal elements are rendered.  <BR> <BR>On both CT and OSX with sub-pixel smoothing on (&quot;Best for LCD&quot;), vertical elements are rendered using sub-pixel rendering.  <BR> <BR>With CT, horizontal elements are pixel-aligned, just like non-antialiased type. This leads to a bit of jaggy-ness in strokes that are close to horizontal, like the middle of the lowercase s in the examples John provided. The most noticeable difference in the Longhorn example is the addition of sub-pixel spacing, as Si noted. <BR> <BR>With OSX, horizontal elements are antialised the conventional way, using varying shades of gray. This leads to smoother glyph shapes, even in slightly horizontal elements, but also a certain degree of fuzziness with some fonts at some sizes. OSX also appears to use sub-pixel spacing because the glyph patterns vary in the same way as the Longhorn CT example. <BR> <BR>To my eye, CT renders text more crisply with some distortion of the glyph shapes, while OSX renders text with more even color and less distortion at the expense of crispness.  <BR> <BR>They both look good to me, but for different reasons. I don't know which would be best for reading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Longhorn renderer can apply y-direction antialiasing to smooth horizontals, but this would normally only be turned on as the type size increases (this is design specific: MS have defined a new GASP table format so that font developers can set the sizes at which y-direction antialiasing kicks in). Y-direction antialiasing makes display type look excellent, but as in the OSX display, it reduces contrast and crispness at small sizes. One thing that pretty much all legibility/readability research agrees on is that contrast is key to reading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, John, for these marvellous specimens. I am just blown over by how much more readable Verdana is than anything else you have shown. You have really helped me deepen my appreciation of Verdana. In the past, I believe I have muttered some words to the effect of 'oh, Verdana, nothing special, anyone who has ever seen a 4-1/2 point news sans could have done it.' And I have also said that Verdana was the world's ugliest sans serif, even if it was also the world's most functional. Well, I take that all back. Verdana is a miracle of legibility, and in massed type, as you have set it here, I must to my utter astonishment admit that I actually find it almost heartbreakingly beautiful. Now those are words I thought I would never utter!  <BR> <BR>Again, with Georgia. You really help me see why it is so much more readable than the comparison fonts. Carter is really much better than even I thought he was. <BR> <BR>Great job!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Verdana is really excellent: difficult to improve on, and it adapts well to ClearType. It will be interesting to see what people think of the Meiryo Latin, which is based on Verdana. I was about to post specimens of that type, including comparison with Verdana, but now Bill has shown up in this thread, I'm not going to post any more. <BR> <BR>I think Georgia suffers under ClearType: the stem weights, geared to producing the best b/w pixel arrangements, make the colour of text very uneven under ClearType. It would be great if MS hired Matthew to revise Georgia for ClearType: it is a splendidly readable face (barring the default linespacing, which is too tight, but I doubt if that is Matthew's fault). <BR> <BR>Anyway, goodbye, again.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is a fascinating display. It is immediately clear that Verdana, in either rendering system, looks better than the other sans serifs. It is less obvious why Georgia, again in either rendering system, is superior. Very generally I would suggest that it is a matter of the proportions - - the proportions and weight of each letter individually, and each in relation to its neighbour, the perfect judgment of the serifs, which really do aid readability, and the well-judged x-height. What I find particularly remarkable is that when magnified even a little, one sees that the rendering of the newer fonts is better in some respects than for Georgia. Yet there is something so sturdy and functional about the shapes of Georgia that even at its worst, it easily emerges as the most readable. How on earth did he do it? <BR> <BR>One thing I am curious about is that so many of the new fonts seem to be somewhat compressed. Traditional wisdom has it that this impedes readability, and I am with traditional wisdom here. But was there a practical reason to make the new fonts slightly compressed? <BR> <BR>I notice also with interest that few of the numbers in the new fonts seem happy. Some are too small, others have too much ascender and descender play, few seem just right in relation to text, although they might look fine on their own. Were they tested in text?  <BR> <BR>Do please post some more. It would be nice to see Meiryo Latin, and it would be lovely to see Georgia in one of the narrower columns of continuous text such as the one directly above. <BR> <BR>it would also be great to see some larger text samples and perhaps a few fitting tests. <BR> <BR>Oh, and a question: you write, &quot;I suspect that most of you will have a lower resolution screen than mine, so the graphics will appear larger on your screens than on mine.&quot; <BR> <BR>Could you tell us what your resolution is? Is it some special kind of monitor that can't be generally bought? And what are your preferred CT settings? What I'm getting at is, if you're going to say that the particular equipment you use when viewing these pages is important, than you ought to specify the equipment. That way some of us might be able to view the material under optimum conditions. I would expect that everyone reading this has some kind of reasonable minimum as regards equipment, but perhaps I am naive?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, see my response in the 'CT and the future' thread re. Verdana and Georgia. <BR> <BR>[I'm sitting here &ndash; unable to sleep as it happens &ndash; wondering if it is possible that we might actually have a civil discussion. I would like that.] <BR> <BR>I think the new CT fonts might <i>seem</i> compressed because they're not what we've become used to in 'screen fonts'. With the exception of Calibri, which I think of primarily as a subhead type, they're actually not compressed in terms of the norms of print typography. Candara is very generously proportioned, and Corbel and Constantia are both quite typical in width for sans and serif text types. ClearType reduces the gap between screen and print, and as it and monitor resolutions improve the gap will be further reduced. Unlike some of the people at MS, I'm not convinced that reading on screen will ever be as comfortable as reading print (presuming similar levels of relative quality &ndash; there is some printing that is decidedly worse than text on screen!), but I do think that ClearType brings the conventions of screen and print typography closer together. Yes, after using Georgia and Verdana in every screen reading situation for so long because they were the only option, most other fonts are going to seem compressed at first. <BR> <BR>Yes, numerals were tested in text. I have a theory about numbers on screen, based on the fact that we don't actually read numbers in the same sense that we read text (except perhaps commonly recurring numbers such as dates from recent years). I suspect that we notice the compromises of low resolution more consciously in numerals than in letters forming words. <BR> <BR>By the way, the new CT fonts all contain at least four different numeral styles (not counting superscript and subscript): proportional oldstyle, proportional lining, tabular oldstyle and tabular lining, and some of the families also include smallcap lining numerals. MS decided that the proportional oldstyle figures would be the default for all the families except Cambria (the latter is intended things like for business documents, in which tabular lining is likely to be expected as default). <BR> <BR>I will try to find some time to post more graphics in the next few days. If you let me know what kind of things you would like to see in a fitting text, I can see what I can do. Making the graphics with my test tools is time consuming, because I can't show multiple sizes or styles at the same time, so have to cobble the graphics together. <BR> <BR>Regarding my monitor, as I noted in the caption for the first graphic, my display is 146ppi. This is a 15&quot; widescreen Dell laptop display, running 1900 x 1200 pixels. So I have a pixel pitch of about 0.1725mm. As far as I know, it is the best display this side of the IBM 200ppi monitor. <BR> <BR>I have another laptop that I use when I'm travelling because it is very small and light, but it only has about a 105ppi screen and it is very difficult to go from reading ClearType on my Dell to reading it on the lower resolution screen. For some tasks, I turn ClearType off on the smaller machine and use b/w rendering instead. ClearType really comes into its own around 130ppi: that's the 'sweet spot' at which, even at text sizes, design details like serif form start to become distinguishable and the individual identity of typefaces start to assert themselves.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is great, thanks very much. At first glance I see nothing alarmingly irregular in this (the Calibri spacing), although I could (and in fact do) quarrel with the underlying parameters, but that is another issue. This makes me suspect that there really <em>is</em> something fantastically wrong with the Poynter showing. I should have the book soon, anyway. But &hellip; if the Poynter setting is an accurate representation of the book (and I see no reason to suppose that it is not) and if the book, therefore, has some really awful spacing, the question arises, how on earth did it get there? Is it even remotely possible that the book was set with InDesign, with the optical kerning settings on? And could they have caused these problems? Just last week, finally, after all these years, I actually tested InDesign CS for an article. (Surely, John, you will be glad that I have done this, as you have been asking me to do it since at least the end of 1999!) I discovered some rather alarming things about the optical kerning - far worse than anything even I ever suspected. Could that be the problem? Or, could some designer have done some hand kerning that was hopelessly misguided? Such things, after all, do happen! Needless to say, it's MS that ought to be finding out the answers to these questions, not me! But let me get on with my measurements. Too bad I don't have the fonts! I should hate to have to go abegging to the ACT for them!</div>

But none of the other showings of the fonts in the book should be optically kerned. If they were, it would be an error, and I'm sure I would have heard about it from Luc(as), because he is very particular about his spacing, as anyone who has seen his 'Kernologica' presentation knows. I don't always agree with the way he spaces and kerns, but I do know that he is very thorough in his approach.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah. It <em>could</em> explain everything, if the text in the Poynter specimen was, indeed, kerned by InDesign. <BR> <BR>Of course, one couldn't be sure without testing the font in InDesign, but I have a very good idea of what might have happened. <BR> <BR>Consider the word ' jumps' set at 12 point in Adobe Garamond OT Pro. No kerning for any of the letter combinations. Everything just sets perfectly, it has been perfectly spaced by not any longer so Slimbach. Now apply 'optical kerning'. InDesign subtracts 23 units of space between j and u, adds 14 units between u and m, subtracts 16 units between m and p, and -1 units between p and s.  <BR> <BR>The u is now much too close to j, and there is a coruscating river of space between u and m.

I was wondering how much more efficient, so prepared this illustration. The strings of letters in this image represent the relative frequency of lowercase letters occuring in an English text of 34,643 words; I've compared this to frequencies in other, somewhat smaller samples (c. 10,000 words) to confirm that it is similar or identical to what you could expect in other texts. The only distortion in the frequencies is the q, which was rounded up to 1 from .3 in order to ensure that at least one instance of every letter appeared in the sequence. <BR> <BR>To assist comparison, I have reduced the linespacing of Meiryo in this graphic to match that of Verdana. <BR> <BR>Top, Verdana.

		<div class="commentbody">Most interesting images. I hate to be so perverse, but I don't think I like Meiryo as much as Verdana. However, I've only looked at these images, briefly, on the Mac, on two monitors, 1600x1200, colour and greyscale (which remains I must say sharper than anything else I've ever seen). I'll look on the PC later. Speaking of which, I have exactly the same Dell screen you specified. Does it make any difference what browser is used? How should ClearType be set up? And are there any other desired parameters? I wouldn't want to make some silly mistake in some setting that would invalidate the view. <BR> <BR>But before anything else, and just based on the quickest glance, I am coming to wonder the following: I am not at all sure I like the new proportions of Meiryo (considered not at all as a companion to Japanese, but simply as an alternate Latin to Verdana - that is of course a wrong consideration, but let it stand for the sake of argument), and I know I don't like many of the proportions (x, desc, asc, cap height) of the new CTs. So: is there a technical reason for these proportions? Or was there some research which suggested these proportions as desirable and which was incorporated into the design briefs? I suspect I'm on the wrong track here, but I do wonder. <BR> <BR>Speaking of the design briefs, that is helpful background, and there is much to respond to in that and other areas when time allows. <BR> <BR>Finally, I find myself uncomfortable with the new default line spacings, which I find too generous. I wonder the following: are the new line spacings calculated to improve comprehension of every word? If so, is it possible that they impede rapid skimming? My point being that I don't actually want, on screen, in many cases, to read every word of text before me as I haven't the time. I want to be able to glance at the entire paragraph and take away as much information as I can in a couple of seconds. For this purpose, I would suggest that tighter default line spacing might be more helpful.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, one last post, and then I'm going to sleep. <BR> <BR>Since you're looking at screenshots rather than live rendering, it doesn't matter how you have your ClearType tuned. What you are seeing is how I have <i>my</i> ClearType tuned. You should be able to make a direct comparison of live Georgia rendering on your own screen to the first image above if you do want to compare tuning. Be sure to compare to the WinXP rendering in the image, not the Longhorn. The background colour of the above images is R255,G255,B220. <BR> <BR>The proportions of the new types was not technically determined, no. The horizontal proportions were left to the discretion of the designers. Since the new CT renderer allows glyph boundaries to fall on subpixels, there isn't a technical need to conform to something approximating full pixel widths as there was for Georgia and Verdana. As I wrote previously, I think part of your reaction to the proportions of the new types might be that you are so used to the wideness of Verdana and Georgia in on screen reading. I'd be interested to know, in a couple of years, after you've had a chance to live with the new types for a few months, whether you still dislike their proportions. <BR> <BR>Regarding the linespacing, the idea was that the <i>default</i> linespacing should be similar to that which one would use e.g. in a book for a text column of typical length according to the canons of traditional typography. I don't think one can make assumptions about how people want to read text on screen. Yes, there is probably more skimming on screen than in print, simply because of the quantity of information presented, but I think it would be a mistake to set default vertical metrics in a font based on this. And, as I say, this is only the default spacing, employed where there is no human intervention in the linespacing. You can always increase or reduce the linespacing as appropriate to particular text using CSS. <BR> <BR>Goodnight.</div>

In those days, you could tell right off by putting your finger on the i or l key, and holding it for while, then, if you looked closely at the picket fence, you could see some spaces larger than others in the sub-pixel positioned vs. pixel positioned specimen, where the picket was/is perfect. <BR> <BR>In the specimen, (Post Number: 1857), both the images of the glyphs and the spacing between the glyphs varies.

So, when I say color has become more important than rythym, you know what I mean.</i> <BR> <BR>Can you perhaps grab the image and edit it to indicate specific places where you think the spacing varies? I'd like to confirm that we are talking about the same thing. <BR> <BR>If the spacing did vary, it could only vary by a subpixel, but I think there is a spacing illusion caused by the variation in the glyph rendering that may account for what you are seeing. If you look at the close-up from the Meiryo in post number 1857, below, you will see that the spacing of touched sub-pixels is actually very regular indeed, but the colour density of those touched pixels varies, making some glyphs look lighter on one side or the other. I think this can create the illusion of greater space between some glyphs than others. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/68521.gif" alt="Meiryo subpixel close-up"> <BR> <BR>The question of rhythm is an interesting one in regard to screen typography, because although it is possible to create very regular intervals of verticals in b/w bitmap rendering &ndash; and this was a major goal of most of the hinting that has been done in the past decade and a bit &ndash; this is done at the expense of that interplay of rhythm and form that we prize in good text faces for print. So, for example, the subtle reduction in the widths of the bowls of a lowercase <i>m</i> relative to that of the <i>n</i> is abandoned in b/w screen rendering in favour of total regularity in the spacing of verticals. Is this really typographic rhythm? Or is it a mechanically determined simulacrum? The rhythm of a well hinted font in a b/w display, compared to the rhythm of even the same typeface in print (Verdana is a good example, despite being designed around bitmaps: Matthew has put into the design as much subtlety of rhythm as he could, which is only evident in print), is a bit like the rhythm of a drum machine compared to Buddy Rich. <BR> <BR>The promise of sub-pixel rendering and positioning &ndash; only just beginning to be delivered on the higher resolution screens, in my opinion &ndash; is that the subtleties of typographic rhythm, i.e. rhythm as it relates to form and not merely to regularity, can be deployed on screen as it is in print. (although obviously not to the same degree of refinement). <BR> <BR>I think at the moment, we're in an awkward position where the technology of screen displays is in transition, and we can no longer optimise type for a presumed level or type of display, as we could when MS commissioned Georgia and Verdana. ClearType is in part an anticipatory technology. This is also true to some degree of the new CT fonts; there are details in Constantia, for example, which probably won't be evident on screen, except at very large sizes, for several years, but they are based on the direction of development of both the CT renderer and screen resolution.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Counting subpixels in the enlargement above, I note that there seems to be a single subpixel increase in space between the touched subpixels of the 2nd and 3rd <i>i</i> and between the 5th and 6th. But this is because the stems of the 3rd and 6th <i>i</i> appear to be one subpixel narrower than the others. This confirms my suspicion that the actual spacing is regular &ndash; in terms of the advanced widths of the glyphs falling on regular subpixel boundaries &ndash;, but there is an illusion of spacing variation based on the variation in stem rendering. <BR> <BR>At this point in the conversation, it would probably be helpful to hear from Mike Duggan or Beat Stamm, since we're reaching the limits of my own technical knowledge of ClearType.

		<div class="commentbody">Bill: if you want to control the space between letters with subpixel accuracy, then the relative offset of the glyph with respect to the pixel grid will have different subpixel values for different renderings. Otherwise, you're forced to quantize to whole-pixel space values, which can be ok if the spacing of the font is carefully tuned to screen resolutions, but can also be a serious problem for WYSIWYG rendering. <BR> <BR>The basic antialiasing algorithm is to render the glyph at a higher resolution in monochrome (say 400 dpi for a 100 dpi rendering), then count the number of &quot;on&quot; pixels within each 4x4 cell. If you offset the pixel by 1/4 increments, that corresponds to offsetting the high-resolution rendering by 1 pixel increments before doing the subsampling, which is all pretty straightforward. (Adobe uses 4x4 subsamping and 1/4 pixel subpixel positioning accuracy in their font renderer that ships with Acrobat; Apple does something a little different which results in even higher precision). <BR> <BR>Doing grayscale subpixel offset to a stem aligned to the pixel grid (as the result of hinting, perhaps) reduces contrast. If the high res rendering is ####<em><strong><em>, and you subsample by 4, then you get #</em>, which is quite crisp. Move two pixels to the right, so that the high res is <strong>####</strong>, and the subsampled version has two pixels of 1/2 intensity. <BR> <BR>With ClearType, subpixel positioning has much less of an effect on contrast, because of the subpixel LCD addressing. A stem which is rendered as RGB</strong></em> and shifted 1/3 pixel to the right turns into <em>GBR</em>_, which visually looks almost the same. (I believe Adobe uses 1/3 pixel subpixel positining increments in their CoolType implementation). Even if you shift by 1/2 pixel, you get <em>gBRg</em>, which is a lot better than the grayscale case. <BR> <BR>As far as I know, there is no patent protection on basic subpixel positioning in antialiased text (I know AA text itself goes back well over 20 years). MS, of course, has a sheaf of patents on their ClearType implementation, but it is unclear to me whether those cover the basic concept of LCD subpixel rendering, or just their specific implementation. If the latter, then Apple (with their &quot;font smoothing&quot;) and Adobe (with CoolType) don't have anything to fear in the patent department. <BR> <BR>As for other competing systems, you might be interested in my <a href="http://artofcode.com/fontfocus/">FontFocus</a>, which does <i>not</i> use LCD subpixelling, but does a much better job of preserving spacing than techniques based on quantizing to pixel coordinates. I am finding, incidentally, very little interest in the technology, so it's not clear I'm going to keep working on it (even though I do have a few more ideas on how to refine it still further).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John: thanks for explaining in simpler terms. In the case of ClearType, it's clear that it's not <i>just</i> a case of offsetting by 1/3 pixel (i.e. whole color stripe) increments, as you can see from the following example (taken from your Meiryo, but with the stripe pattern faded in so you can more clearly see the pattern in the underlying subpixel image). <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/68580.png" alt="stripe example"> <BR> <BR>Note how the first two i's have a &quot;darkest pixel&quot; width of two pixels, while the third's is a single pixel wide. If I had to guess, I'd say that the subpixel positioning is calculated to 1/6 pixel accuracy. So the subpixel offset <i>does</i> have an effect on contrast, even aside from the question of which color stripes get addressed.</div>

Try reading aliased type in print and you can see the problem. Some sort of anti-aliasing is called for, but clearly there are differing opinions about the best approach. <BR> <BR>CRTs are a different story. I would agree that aliased text looks better. But I think this is because of the inherent softness of the CRT. Anti-aliasing just makes it look even softer and blurrier. <BR> <BR>This debate will probably continue inconclusively until reasonably-high-resolution displays become the norm and the point becomes moot  (i.e., indefinitely).</div>

At the kick-off meeting in Redmond, we began with a technical briefing on how ClearType works, and the development progressed from that understanding. The initial phase of development for the designs involved sending test glyphs for hinting, to test rendering under ClearType. My own design went through two rounds of weight testing, with five variant stem weights. Decisions about details were informed by the kind of forms that ClearType renders particularly well, and avoiding as much as possible the kind of shallow horizontal diagonals that look jagged under ClearType. I also conducted a series of tests to determine the best italic angle for Constantia's forms under ClearType. <BR> <BR>The designs do address the unique qualities of ClearType. What they do not do, unlike the Base types for example, is to fetishise the technology stylistically. <BR> <BR>Refer also to my explanation of the design briefs in the other thread: the types need to look good in print as well as being readable on screen, because they are intended for areas of use that include both print and screen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So you're saying that it's kind of ironical to discuss the qualities of a series of type designs, because the designer doesn't have control over the design anyway, because the new rasterizer for which the types have been developed will render them in dozens of different ways on the screen? Is that the basic point?  <BR> <BR>Well, so it is. That raises the question, at what point does this make any perceptible difference in the real world? Isn't that part of the science of CT, that artefacts will not be perceptible? I suppose there is the possibility that the studies are all wrong, and the artefacts will actually result in subliminal viewing fatigue, but that seems far-fetched. <BR> <BR>A problem, I now see, with John's images, is that they are, in fact, images, and can thus be enlarged and substantial defects revealed. <BR> <BR>But so what? If you enlarge a photo too much, and put your nose right to the print, the grain will be too large and you won't see anything. But if the normal viewing distance is respected, everything looks sharp and artefact-free. <BR> <BR>The same applies here. When we are looking at real CT onscreen, will we really be able to tell that characters are non-uniformly rasterized and that spacing is subliminally irregular? And if we enlarge the type onscreen, won't such artefacts decrease, not increase? I mean, the type is scalable, so artefacts should be less and less obvious as size increases. (The exact opposite happens with John's images, since they are images of type, not actual type. I hope this is clear to everyone - it is the nature of the bitmapped image versus the nature of scalable type.) I say that I expect CT artefacts to decrease as size increases, and I do, but will that really happen? <BR> <BR>Re increasing the density of the dot of the i, may I play devils advocate and ask if there isn't a point, in a high x-height font, where the i could then be confused with the l? The possible advantage of a weak dot on the i is that you might minimize this possibility. <BR> <BR>Re customers with old equipment, MS must be calculating that those who buy Longhorn will primarily have LCDs with reasonable resolution (at least 1280x960 I would guess) and must have reasonable grounds to make this calculation.  <BR> <BR>How will the CTC types render on older screens using older versions of Windows?  <BR> <BR>And should we be worrying about that? Isn't the whole point of these types that they are not recommended for webpages? <BR> <BR>What interests me more is the hint of a closed, proprietary nature of the type system - a holy grail that the type industry has been searching for ever since the unfortunate invention of PS and TT. <BR> <BR>How does CT-style rendering contrast with Cool Type and Quartz when used with older CRTs? <BR> <BR>Mais je divague. I don't want to lose track of my question: we have established that CT will render 7 consecutive i's in 7 different ways. But we also know that we will never normally have to view a text stream of 7 consecutive i's. However, the point is has been made: strokes are rendered differently, according to their position on the screen vis-a-vis subpixel positioning. What do we gain from this? What do we lose?  <BR> <BR>And another question: what is the processing overhead for CT? We know it is turned off by default in XP, but why? Turning off a great new feature by default is always a mistake, as GX showed. So what's the problem with CT that mandated this counterintuitive situation?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">here is an example showing Natural Widhts ClearType v Subpixelpositioned CT. For reading I much prefer the more accurate spacing and placement of glyphs in the SPP case. There is a slight loss of contrast but the gain is more accuracy in letterfit or letterspacing, (see the word &quot;subtleties&quot; in both cases. I find the SPP to be much better spacing, find your own favorites :-) and a much more even tone or typographic color to the page.

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I'll try to precisely address your comments about discrepancies in rendering and apparent spacing being reduced as the size and resolution increase, once Greg has had a chance to respond about what we have shown so far. In general terms, though, you are correct: the larger the type and the higher the resolution, the less rendering discrepancies should be noticeable. <BR> <BR>Speaking of larger type, though, here are some new images. One of the most dramatic changes in the Longhorn CT renderer will be the introduction of y-direction antialiasing (greyscale smoothing). In the current WinXP implementation of ClearType, only the x-direction is smoothed, using subpixel rendering, while the y-direction is aliased (jagged). In Longhorn, both directions are smoothed, and I think the results for display sizes are truly stunning. In the comparisons below, I show the new CT fonts in WinXP CT rendering and then with the new Longhorn rendering; the latter includes subpixel positioning and kerning as well as the y-direction antialiasing. [Graphic width on my screen = 188mm] <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69048.gif" alt="CT renderer comparison"> <BR> <BR>Since none of the new CT fonts are primarily intended for display setting (especially not the two serif faces), below is another image of the Longhorn rendering applied to a bona fide display face. I'm afraid my CT test tool doesn't allow me to apply OpenType Layout features, so you're only getting the Zapfino default glyphs. [Graphic width on my screen = 129mm] <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69049.gif" alt="Longhorn CT Zapfino"> <BR> <BR>Again, all the usual caveats about trying to judge the quality of ClearType from screenshots apply.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Now that we are learning so much about CT, would it be possible for someone to discuss what is happening along these lines in CoolType and Quartz, using the same excellent paedagogical principles we have been seeing here? <BR> <BR>I am deeply impressed with the y-axis improvement provided by LH CT and remain to be convinced that its disadvantages outweigh its advantages. However, I continue to be disturbed by obvious anomalies in the types. For example, why is the lower vertical offshoot of the C in Constantia so much less than that of the o? It makes the C look as if it were about 7 or 8 (PS) units higher on the baseline than it ought to be. Is this a defect in the design, or in the rasterizer? I am perplexed to see this problem at such a large size. What is especially odd is that I don't see this anomaly in the book. Yet, if the rasterizer is at fault, why do we not see this overshoot problem in the other samples? Curious.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Excellent spotting, Bill. The 'C' doesn't overshoot at all (it's level with the bottom of the 'n'), but the 'o' overshoots a whole pixel exactly as you'd expect at this size. Since the cap-height is 74px, that's about a 110px em, which works out to 9 PS units. My guess is that this is an artifact of overzealous y-direction TrueType hinting. <BR> <BR>For comparison, here are some images I made on OSX. First, without subpixel positioning (grayscale). Apologies that this sample was made with default ligatures turned on, so it doesn't exactly match John's sample. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69145.png" alt="Zapfino OS X 10.3 grayscale"> <BR> <BR>Second, with subpixel positioning (&quot;smoothing&quot; in Apple lingo) set to Medium: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69146.png" alt="Zapfino OS X 10.3 Medium smoothing"> <BR> <BR>Note the strong thickening of the thin strokes. I think this is Apple's idea of pseudo optical scaling, and may even help at text sizes, but here is a bit much. <BR> <BR>In my opinion, the grayscale rendering is competitive with CT. To my eyes, it looks like CT is doing a better job controlling gamma, but the CT also has some quirks such as the near-dropout on the 'c'. <BR> <BR>The best rendering I was able to produce of this particular font was a straight area sample (16:1 from a monochrome bitmap), followed by a gamma of 1.4 and the (255,255,220) tint. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69147.png" alt="Zapfino&#44; pure area sample with 1.4 gamma"> <BR> <BR>To my eyes, this sample shows that you don't get much benefit from RGB subpixelling at display sizes, but of course other people may see things differently.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Greg Hitchcock at Microsoft responds regarding the rendering width variation noted above. <BR> <BR>Short answer: <BR><i>From a scan conversion point of view, we break each pixel down into six parts&ndash;two parts per sub-pixel. If we were trying to display a feature that was one pixel wide and aligned on the pixel boundary, it would take three sub-pixels to represent that. If we were to take that same one pixel wide feature, and instead shift it one half of one sub-pixel in (one part of the six) then it would take up the three sub-pixels of the pixel plus an additional sub-pixel to the right, for a total of four sub-pixels. Of course the edge sub-pixels are grayed to represent this spatial shift.</i> <BR> <BR>Extended answer: <BR><i>Scan conversion is the process of turning a vector representation into a bitmap representation. The scan conversion rule we use in TrueType is if the center of the pixel (or a virtual pixel in the case of anti-aliasing) falls on the interior of a closed outline, then that pixel will be turned &quot;on.&quot; In the case of a virtual pixel, you could imagine taking a real pixel, and breaking it into fourths (2x2). Then using the scan conversion algorithm, you figure out how many of the virtual pixel centers are in the interior of the outline. If for example the outline included two of the four virtual pixels, then the true pixel would be assigned a gray level of 2/4ths. This method is called a box filter. There are other weighted techniques that can be used, but the box filter is easy to implement and fairly easy to explain. <BR> <BR>Why did we choose six instead of three? To be clear, we're just talking along the horizontal axis here. Three would be very straight forward, each sub-pixel becomes one pixel. But we felt that we got better detail by breaking each sub-pixel up into two virtual sub-pixels&ndash;without the typical loss of contrast caused by full pixel anti-aliasing. We did many experiments in this area. Some of our algorithms broke the full pixel into 40 different parts, and we asymmetrically assigned weights to the colored sub-pixels proportionally based on the eye's ability to perceive color detail (e.g. 60% green, 30% red, and 10% blue). In some of the different tunings available for ClearType, these options can be selected. Ultimately, we felt that two virtual pixels per sub-pixel worked well, and was efficient to implement. I should also note that the ClearType algorithms, as part of the color perception reduction technique, have a bleed of one sub-pixel to the right and one sub-pixel to the left of the feature. This bleed is usually quite small, but it is there.</i></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I want to start with a letterpress perspective inspired by the thread on the new Bembo, where we were discussing the fact that, taking a given line of metal type, weight and spacing may vary within acceptable limits by 30% (at least) according to how the line is printed. (If you consider that 30% gain in a character has a 60% effect on space anytime two letters are adjacent, you will see why I consider this important for spacing.)  <BR> <BR>More important here is the fact that in all practical letterpress printing, stem widths of individual letters can vary largely, depending on a thousand unpredictable mechanical factors. <BR> <BR>So: Relating the issue of variable stem widths in CT2 to letterpress, I simply cannot get upset about variable stem widths in ClearType. I realize this is anathema to most digital era designers. But once you have really examined a lot of great letterpress printing under magnification, and have seen how profoundly stem widths routinely vary there, and how little it seems to matter, it just doesn't seem that important that the CT rasterizer will here and there alter shapes of letters. The attempt to weed irrationality out of type rasterization seems to me as pointless as Einstein spending the last 30 years of his life trying to disprove his theory of quantum mechanics. (For a convenient summary, see 'One Hundred Years of Uncertainty', Brian Greene, New York Times Apr 8, 2005, p. A27.) For Einstein's credo, 'God does not play dice with the Universe' simply replace the type designer's 'God does not play dice with stem widths'. Unfortunately, both for Einstein and for rigid typophiles, it seems that God does sometimes gamble.  <BR> <BR>OK, we now have the general idea that the CT rasterizer has now reached the point that it prints to the screen with some quanta of irrationality, just as letterpress prints to the page with some somewhat similar quanta of irrationality. This should not disturb anyone here, except the Einsteins of Type, who, I hear, have temporarily gone missing in Beruit. Would that they might solidify in that state! Alas, quantum mechanics informs us that they are all too likely not to. <BR> <BR>Our job here, now that we have got the philosophical and theoretical generalities out of the way, is to examine the particularities of the system under review. What are the gains of variability here? What are the losses? To what extent do the scores we come up with vary depending on the quality of the hardware, in this case the LCD? To what extent can we say that LCD quality can be indexed grossly but effectively by considering only top resolution capability? What are other variables in LCD quality that would negate such a gross index? <BR> <BR>Has anyone considered the grotesque extent to which fixed resolution LCDs are routinely set to lower resolutions, with ghastly results? Should OSs not contain warning messages about such problems? <BR> <BR>David has pointed out that CT does not interrogate the system for dpi. Isn't this a big mistake? How can this system work unless the OS takes some steps to insure that the user has set up his display hardware optimally? The OS certainly has this capability. Here is a display system that will, if something isn't done, be routinely wrecked by a huge proportion of users, who will take 1600x1200 LCDs and set the resolution to 800x600, just because 'the type seems to small.' How do we intelligently deal with this challenge if the OS does not take intelligent control of all the relevant parameters? We must consider that most users do not know even how to use the zoom control in MS Word. <BR> <BR>My very preliminary judgement is that Microsoft has done a phenomenal job of dealing with most of the issues of variability at hand. Of course I could be quite wrong - perhaps I overestimate the brilliance of the CT engineers. I simply don't have the background to judge and hope that others with more perspective and deeper knowledge will be able to elucidate. Nevertheless, it seems to me that a large technological step forward has been taken here, though it may not be quite as unique as I at first thought. We have not had enough input from others working with this technology. <BR> <BR>That said, I can see only two issues raised so far that need work, none of it, unfortunately easy. <BR> <BR>I think my point that considerable aesthetic and technical review of the new typefaces needs to be undertaken, is valid. <BR> <BR>I think David's point that the OS must know exactly what hardware it is dealing with, screen resolution being the first essential piece of knowledge but certainly not the last, is valid. <BR> <BR>It would be ridiculous to assume that I have somehow got the priorities right. This is only my individual perspective. It would be nice if some bright people would contribute some new thoughts and critiques, unlikely (even from the viewpoint of quantum mechanics) though that may seem.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;I think David's point that the OS must know exactly what hardware it is dealing with&hellip; <BR> <BR>Yes and no. A movie buff would say that you need to get an engineer out to set up your home theatre, a audiophile would say the same thing about your hi-fi, a serious photographer would argue that your wasting your time unless you buy one of those color correction gadgets.  <BR> <BR>I'm as horrified as the next type person when I see non-native resolutions being used. And you're right that OS vendors need to do a much better job of helping detect settings, produce resolution independent products, and help users tune their screen reading experience.  <BR> <BR>But I don't see this is a specific ClearType problem. The problem of non-native LCD resolutions affects regular antialaising and black and white just as much, and in some cases more, than it does ClearType.  <BR> <BR>Si</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One special case that affects ClearType and similar processes worse is when one drops a screen resolution neatly in half. I sometimes do this (going from 1600x1200 to 800x600). It messes things up with these technologies noticeably more than it does with traditional gray-scale anti-aliasing. <BR> <BR>That being said, anybody running an LCD in anything but the native resolution is messing things up, and there's no reason on earth we should sacrifice great improvements in general screen display for these relatively unusual cases. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, I didn't realize that 1600x1200 to 800x600 was a particularly drastic case. However, I think it will become a common one. In two or three years, 16x12 will probably be a kind of norm, and you will have a lot of users - those who could most benefit from CT if only they knew how - switching to 8x6.  <BR> <BR>You are absolutely right that the technology should not be sacrificed to lowest common denominator (LCD!) users. However, I don't think these cases are relatively unusual - I have seen a lot of screens that ordinary folk run lately and not a single LCD was set to its native res - and I do think that provision can and should be made to advise them how to deal with the problem. Their concern is for larger type. Their solution is to lower screen resolution. What has to be made easier is the various mechanisms that programs and OSs have for scaling type. This is one of the great unresolved issues of UI design. <BR> <BR>In the meantime, I have a peripheral question. For those of us who believe (amongst them are DisplayMate's Ray Soneira) that the very best CRTs are still superior to the very best LCDs, and though none of us believes that CRTs are for this world much longer, what is being done to make the CRT experience as good as possible? Or does it make any difference if you have a CRT that is roughly 3200 x 2400 or even more?</div>
