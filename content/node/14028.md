body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Publications]] : FUSE</strong>\r\n\r\nFUSE was mostly
  relevant in the late 1980s and early 1990s as an experimental venue for playing
  with digital type. Only a handful of FUSE fonts became commercially successful --
  which was not the aim of the project, but such a measure can in some ways help discern
  the historical relevance of the work produced. Some of the FUSE work is interesting
  for its own sake, which clearly helped broaden the possibilities of type design
  by throwing out the rules and inventing new and interesting forms and visual ideas.
  On the other end of the spectrum, some FUSE fonts could be more accurately called
  dingbats where no clear connection between the forms and letters exists.\r\n\r\nFUSE
  as a phenomenon, along with the work of other early digital foundries, such as [[Emigre]],
  that defined the early foray into the era of digital type. "
