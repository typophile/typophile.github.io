body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Designers]] : Lars Bergquist</strong>\r\n\r\nLars Bergquist,
  of [[Timberwolf Type]], born in 1936, is a leftover from the age of lead type and
  letterpress printing. His first avocation was history, which may well explain his
  love of classical letterforms, historically significant typefaces and fuddy-duddy
  typography in general. He did however spend a lifetime in technically advanced reference
  publishing. In retirement, he decided to spend his next life as a type designer.
  His type designs, both text faces and display fonts, are distributed worldwide by
  several independent type foundries. He has been happily married to the same woman
  since 1964, lives outside Stockholm, Sweden, and has two daughters and a grandson.
  His atypical interests are history, small arms, photography and hiking in the mountains
  of Lapland.\r\n\r\n(info from [[Fountain]] website) "
