  body: "Recommending a printer depends on what your project is.\r\n\r\nIt also depends
    on how you define \"print on demand.\" that term means different things to different
    people. It ain't codified yet.\r\n\r\nIf you tell us more about your project,
    recommendations will be given, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nGood luck. I'll wait to see what
    you tell us.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "yeah good point, thanks will \r\n\r\nits a personal portfolio, so very low
    volume (20-30 copies)\r\n\r\nI'm looking for good quality and low volume, with
    cost or time not being a huge issue. \r\n\r\nthanks \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: b/w Lulu does really well. Did some calendars through Lulu this year and the
    colour was pretty good. Not earth-shatteringly good, but it looked passably professional.

  body: "You should check out BookMobile. See them at Bookmobile.com. They are my
    preferred short-run book printer. Many university presses use them also.\r\n\r\nColor
    / b+w / paperbind / casebind.\r\n\r\ngood service. excellent quality. Much better
    than any I've sen from Lightning. I have not used Lulu.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "We used Lulu for the first time a month ago. Was not at all impressed with
    their website. Nor with their instructions on creating the PDFs. And getting an
    answer from their chat room or forums was a complete joke.\r\n\r\nDespite the
    initial difficulties we printed a color book, 6x9, paperback. The color wasn't
    bad, but certainly not stellar. We went ahead and printed an additional copy.
    This time the binding was awful\u2014way, way too much glue. We sent it back and
    Lulu redid the job (for free). Fortunately the turn-around time for both print
    runs was very quick. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I would recommend Lulu, but not wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\nsarah"

  body: "I've recently become obsessed with Lulu, though interior color jobs leave
    much to be desired.\r\n\r\nI've scanned a number of old photocopy collections
    of documents that I had and designed a few covers and presto, I can toss the photocopies
    (or pass them off to someone else).\r\n\r\nThe books aren't really cheap enough
    to wholesale, unless you've got some really good stuff that would demand high-dollar,
    but I'm putting together some facsimile collections of booklets for my wife's
    store. \r\n\r\nWhen they send out lousy product, I've heard nothing besides that
    they'll fix it right away for free."
