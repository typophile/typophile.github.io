		<div class="commentbody">Imo, OSF is the way to go in stationery design, if the font allows for it. They simply visually fit in better with miuscle letterforms and make for a more lively reading. In tables, of course, lining (or better still monospaced tabular) figures are what you need, but in brochures, books, stationery and anything that adheres to the general rules of what makes reading text easier, OSF is nicer. Also, to me, it looks more professional, not as run-of-the-mill&hellip; OSF are anything but old-stlye, I think. Actually, I much prefer them to the lining figures that came up during the 70s and 80s,when you even had lining figures on Renaissance fonts like Garamond and the like, which clearly need OSFs. :-D. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok. I have to agree with you about the small caps usage. If you do use small caps, then you should probably use the OsF because the do fall in line beside the small caps much better than to the lining. Thank you for clarifying that. However, I do still standby my statement of stationery being design more of the information variety. Too much OsF, IMO, is a bad thing in a stationery system.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm a sucker for OSFs. There is a certain sophistication to them, and it's one of the tell-tale signs of whether something is professionally set (this sounds really superficial, just generally speaking). When I was in high school designing newsletters and magazines, I so much wanted expert sets so I could be more of a typographer rather than a desktop publisher! <BR> <BR>Though OSFs can look terribly fuzzy for certain things. Like for general word-processing tasks like an invoice or letter, I tend to stay away from OSF even when I'm using a typeface that has them - ITC Charter, more often than not. Charter's lining numerals are beautiful though. Georgia is a very nice general purpose font, but the lack of lining numerals would be very problematic for people like accountants. <BR> <BR>How about 'short' lining numerals? For example in Bell? Or Miller? They don't jump out at you in continuous text, and look 'lively' enough to be interesting. I would be happy to do without OSFs for these typefaces. <BR> <BR>How about lining old-style figures? They line up in neat columns and jump up and down. A nice addition, I think. Many of Adobe's Pro fonts have them. <BR> <BR>I think for people like me who don't like numbers, OSFs are more pleasant to read. At least they don't look so monotonous. And I tend to think that they even help me read them better (shape recognition, just like caps vs lowercase). <BR> <BR>For me, definitely OSFs on business cards. But how about ISBN numbers and such? <BR> <BR>Have you noticed certain designers/firms don't use OSFs at all? Like Massimo Vignelli, and Pentagram. They are trying to be 'modern'?! OSFs are also rarely seen in magazines, and definitely not newspapers. And not to mention cheap novels (they probably just don't know better/couldn't be bothered).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've only seen &quot;lining numerals&quot; to mean where the numbers are the same height. Usually this means the same height of the caps as well, but not always: there are short lining numerals (pioneered by Austin/Bell), and I think they generally work better. Lining numerals are often fixed-width. <BR> <BR>The &quot;opposite&quot; of lining numerals are old-style numerals (which are called all kinds of funny things, like &quot;up-and-down numerals&quot;), and they generally behave like lc letters, but not always: there's what's called &quot;hybrid&quot; numerals, which have larger-than-x=height bodies, but also feature extenders. The foremost practitioner of this style is Luc[as] de Groot, although happily this style -which I consider the ideal for text- is getting quickly more popular. There are actually tentative traces of this in some ATF fonts (like Garamond), but Luc[as] was the first to really flourish the hybrid style, as far as I've found. <BR> <BR>Old-style numerals are rarely fixed-width, even though structurally they actually fit that mold more easily! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd take Version a) or b), although I like a) a bit better.  <BR> <BR>The reasoning behind the circles is very very nice, in my opinion. I can see the quick and easy way that FFLefthand came over you &hellip; but it doesn't add a personal touch, but rather fakes the illusion of personality in an industrial fashion&hellip; that is kinda the opposite of what you want to express, thus my comment. Maybe it is still possible to at least work a bit on the individual letterforms and add a tuch of inividuality without compromising the already established version too much&hellip;? <BR> <BR>I don't think the f is too much of a problem. Maybe it helps to make the p and f bold, to better differntiate them from the numbers? Or you use Small Caps for these two letters, so they make an ideal fit with the numerals and the overall design should look quite nice as well with the added SC.  <BR> <BR>One more thing &ndash; I'm not suire how this is done in the US but in Europe we tend to divide off the phonenumbers into little packages, like this:  <BR> <BR>0201 849 61 64  <BR>(with less space between the numbers, of course) <BR> <BR>Isn't that done overseas? Because apart from the dots I don't see any kind of this and I wondered if it would even make sense, as there are never more than four digits in a sub-section. Just trying to learn something here&hellip;  <BR> <BR>Aaaand, when I'm already playing 20-stupid-questions-for-a-buck&hellip; Just to satisfy my curiosity: what is the meaning of the x123?

I am speculating here, I have not tried it, but I'll bet that small caps will be different enough and at the same time not match enough to work just right. Give and take. Try it. I'll bet it will work. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I totally agree with Keith that the extension number is way out place there. I can not stress enough how much you should move that.
