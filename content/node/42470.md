  or is very similar to the \"orca\" logo for the Orca Triathlon gear? \r\n\r\nI am
  not sure how to insert a picture here so will post two links below. The first is
  Orca's site. The logo I am talking about is the white word orca in the top left
  corner\r\n\r\nThe second link is a larger resolution image in black on white. \r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance!\r\nRick\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.orca.com/]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.nelsontriclub.co.nz/Photos/Elite2004/ORCA_LOGO_main.JPG

  body: Thanks, Jan, for the suggestion. I agree with you. With all the fonts out
    there, however, I was hoping that someone may recognize the pattern and know of
    an established font that may be similar. :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ORCA_LOGO_main[1]_3803.JPG]

  body: I suspect there are freeware fonts in a similar style out there, but it'll
    be a bitch to locate them. :^/
