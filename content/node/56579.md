  body: "Actually . . . not Avenir. \r\n\r\nYes, some early, leaked screen images
    used Avenir as a placeholder (as seen above), but the final Palm Pre release uses
    [[http://www.fontbureau.com/news/2009-06-10|Prelude]], a custom font made for
    Palm and webOS. \r\n\r\nSimilar feeling, but not the same:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PalmPre_ContactProfile_5658.png]"

    -- Ya gotta admit: if you're Palm and you've gotta be hyping Palm's new iPhone
    killer at CES or someplace like that, then \"Desi\" looks a whole lot cooler than
    \"Betty,\" now doesn't it?"
