body: Attached is September Heavy Italic by Device Fonts.  I've seen fonts like this
  used in countless logos.  I'm looking for more fonts like this, where about half
  the corners are rounded and it looks slightly future/tech.  Does this look familiar
  to anyone?

      R, and the unusually low crossbars on the A and R as well as the tail on the
      V kind of ruin it for me.\r\n\r\nI like the way <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000043\">Pill
      Gothic</a> combines angularity and roundness.\r\n\r\nAny more ideas?"

  body: Interesting, but I'm going for something with more consistent stroke widths.  More
    commercial.  Thanks for all the ideas, keep them coming!
