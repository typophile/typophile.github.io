  1940s. The sign on the building was probably installed in 1941.  \r\nThe first image
  is a historic photo of the building sign. The second photo shows the current state
  where the letters have been stripped from the wall. We plan on replacing the sign.\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/MA_historic

  body: It's lettering or hand-drawn/designed and not likely to be based on a font.
    If it were me, I would just trace and/or redraw the letters based on the photos.
