body: "In 2001, [[Ray Larabie]] launched Typodermic, his commercial font foundry with
  a small selection of fonts at very reasonable prices. \"As long as the ideas keep
  coming,\" Ray says he will continue making new fonts. Designing at his home office
  near, appropriately, Fonthill, Ontario, he now works on fonts full-time. \"I'm lucky
  to be doing something I enjoy everyday,\" is how he describes himself. His wife,
  Rina, runs the business, writes ad copy and creates graphics for his new font releases.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typodermic.com/"
