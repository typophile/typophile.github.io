  our own Graphic Design busness &#40;within a year&#41;. But are in two minds about
  the direction for our identity.  <BR> <BR>We have two ideas which I would like to
  put forward.  <BR> <BR>1 - Scratch Graphics &#40;or&#41; Vendetta Design : Focusing
  on graphic design within the creative industry, but also extending to brand/corporate
  identity. <BR> <BR>2 - Focusing our own identity on the fact we are brothers, therefore
  using our own surname and exploiting the brotherly LOVE/HATE relationship.   <BR>
  <BR>I guess what I am asking, is would we be limiting ourselves from prospective
  clients if we name ourselves SCRATCH GRAPHICS / VENDETTA DESIGN. We are trying not
  to jump into an identity too soon.   <BR> <BR>The more I think this through, the
  more I am looking at the BROTHER identity. But would appreciate feedback from anyone
  offering their profound knowledge and experience. <BR> <BR>Take care <BR>kumbuniko

  body: May I ask what your surname is.? <BR> <BR>I would maybe tend to choose the
    surname version.. <BR>&#40; Because of you being brothers, sharing the same name
    and having such close relationship.. &#41;

  body: You&#39;re definitely creating a recognizable and memorable identity if you
    use your surname, especially if your main marque is something, for the lack of
    a better phrase, horrifying or scary. Like if your logo was just all-caps &#39;Manson
    Design&#39; written in blood. <BR> <BR>But you certainly run the risk of repelling
    potential clients solely on the basis of your name

  body: I would not attempt a gory image to go with my surname. But perhaps exploit
    its eccentricity.  <BR> <BR>I doubt many people would associate MANSON with gore
    and I would not even head in that direction. <BR> <BR>We do not plan to hire any
    other family members. Just me and my brother. Since we bounce and feed off each
    other with respect to design and marketting. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback,
    I shall stew these responses and keep branstorming. <BR> <BR>take care <BR> <BR>

    <BR>I think incorporating &#34;Manson&#34; would be great if the target clientele
    is &#34;edgy&#34; &#40;like Chase says&#41;. The fact that your surname is indeed
    Manson means nobody can hold any allusions to criminality against you &#40;at
    least not formally&#41;. And when somebody asks you if Charles&#39;s reputation
    had anything to do with your choice of name, you can tailor your answer depending
    on what kind of person is asking! It can help you create an atmosphere, an illusion,
    based on the needs at hand. <BR> <BR>Visually: I would try some kind of Yin/Yang
    opposition/unity thing &#40;but not too literal a reference to the Yin/Yang symbol
    itself&#41;. Here&#39;s one of my most favorite logos &#40;by Gahlord Dewald&#41;:
    <a href="http://www.thtfct.com/" target="_blank">http://www.thtfct.com/</a> <BR>
    <BR>BTW, note that &#34;Manson&#34; is &#34;man&#34;&#43;&#34;son&#34;; maybe
    you can play the sibling aspect into that. Like maybe some kind of tree with two
    branches? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: If you&#39;re going for an eccentric angle, perhaps a near-minimalist logo
    would work nicely. The yin/yang idea is a good basis, but it&#39;s a pretty common
    reference.  <BR> <BR>You could use Hrant&#39;s literal idea and design a stylized
    man that tesselates with itself, either in the same size or in two complementary
    sizes &#40;man &amp; son&#41;.

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>The &#34;man&#34; &#43; &#34;son&#34; was somethng we were
    thinking of exploiting with regards to our brotherly competitiveness. Promotional
    material which illustrated that envy, jealousy, and immature brotherly habits
    &#40;such as the border within the shared bedroom&#41; played a large role in
    our individual stride to &#34;out-do each other&#34;. <BR> <BR>We intend to target
    the &#34;edgy&#34; clientele despite which name we choose. But were concerned
    with regards to corporate identity. <BR> <BR>Do corporate identity jobs tend to
    be conservative clients? Would YOU be turned off by a surname?  <BR> <BR>We have
    constantly been asked throughout our lives about our surname. Resultng in us giving
    them the answer they were hoping for. Then it changed with Marilyn heading into
    the mix. <BR> <BR>I tend to be optimistic with regards to our name. And since
    we will also be striving into brandng/advrtising, it could make for a brilliant
    edge with promotional material. <BR> <BR>All your feedback has been great, spurred
    us both into further discussions and scenarios. I want to get this decided well
    before my institutional study ends. <BR> <BR>take care
