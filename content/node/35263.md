  the fonts are targeted for use on Mac and Windows, and for print. By right, I mean
  the regular and bold are the proper distance in weight from each other on both platforms,
  and when printed. \r\n\r\nI can solve everything except this one thing: is it possible
  to use one digital outline for the screen, but when it goes to print (a word document),
  another font is substituted? This is to get around the problem that I can make a
  regular and bold that work on the Mac, but regular is then too light for Windows,
  so it gets hinted to be heavier for windows, no problem. But then the printing of
  regular is too light if I do it thus so we want a bolder regular to be used only
  for that purpose...\r\n\r\nAny route known for this, or should I start mixing some
  Cool-Aid, just like the big guys do? ;-)"

    Or turn hints off at printing? Are these TT or PS outlines?  Seems to me you might
    ask Matthew or Tom about Verdana on this one. \r\n\r\nOr is this one of your sassy
    theorems?   ;)"

    the source of the problem is what happens on the Mac side, yes? You need to make
    the regular light for Mac's hint-free screen rendering, but then it is too light
    for printing.\r\n\r\nWhat you are doing on the Windows side, using hints to beef-up
    the type on-screen, is one approach, but it seems to me that if you are contemplating
    using different outlines for printing you could also use different outlines to
    address the Windows screen rendering.\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that the Mac screen
    rendering is the exceptional environment:\r\n\r\nMac screen = needs to be lighter\r\nMac
    print = needs to be heavier\r\nWin screen = needs to be heavier\r\nWin print =
    needs to be heavier\r\n\r\nSo in theory the most efficient approach would be to
    make the heavier regular outlines the 'default' and address the Mac screen with
    exceptional lighter outlines, rather than making the latter the default and then
    have to jump through hoops on three fronts in order to support the majority need
    for heavier outlines.\r\n\r\nAs I say, this is in theory. The practical question
    is whether folk at Apple or Microsoft are more interested in the issue."
