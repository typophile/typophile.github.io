  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey all</p>
<p>Here is a logo I designed for my firm and I wanted to get some feed back from everyone here.  Now before you all say it; Yes, I know that the scales of justice is one of the most overused legal images but my first name is Troy and I like that the scales evoke the image of an uppercase T.</p>
<p>I wanted a logo that was fairly coservative but with a contemporary feel.  I would be open to adding some color for a little punch, but nothing excessive.  I also wanted a logo that even from a distance would let you know that it belonged to a law firm.  I have seen a lot of really visually appealing law firm logos that didn&rsquo;t give you any indication of whether the company was a law firm or a theme park.</p>
<p>Thanks for all of your help in advance.</p>
<p>(I could not get the image to load on the page, if anyone knows how I can do this please let me know.)![](/images/old-images/Hough Logo.jpg)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Troy, please don&rsquo;t take offense to this, but I would think that if you&rsquo;re practicing law, you can afford to hire a graphic designer to design a proper logo for you. I will say that the logo is not &ldquo;bad&rdquo; per se. You&rsquo;ve done a decent enough job, but it certainly does not look any different than hundreds of other law firm logos out there. Good luck.</div>

As a law office, I don&rsquo;t think you would benefit from a logo that would would be &ldquo;clever&rdquo; in any sense.  Maybe use the T and reference the scales rather that using the scales to reference the T, that way you remove &ldquo;overused legel image&rdquo; issue.  Just some first thoughts</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Its not conserative enough for me. It doesn&rsquo;t inspire confidence, it looks industrial. Loose the cliche scales and use your full name and title(s). Pick a high quality letterhead paper and think of a process you might print the frims name like hot stamping or blind embossing. Go upscale not ambulance chaser.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The scales are definitely overused although I do understand how the &ldquo;t&rdquo; plays in. Visually the HOUGH treatment doesn&rsquo;t make sense. There&rsquo;s no logic to what you&rsquo;re doing with the logo to portray the difference you plan to offer your market.</p>
<p>It does look really industrial. It looks a bit amateurish which would make sense seeing as you&rsquo;re not a professional designer. If you must cut costs, i would say at least go to a design college and recruit a student looking to build their portfolio and throw them some money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good try, but there is a reason why our occupation exists.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I certainly do not plan to outright bag your design, though I do feel a need to support the above statements. Joseph is absolutely correct when he states <em>there is a reason why our occupation exists</em>; as there is a valuable reason why your occupation exists.</p>
<p>At this time I do not feel that your logo sets you out from your competition in a positive manner, nor do I get a feeling of confidence, security, professionalism or excellence in your field, which as an audience member I would hope to get. I also do not feel that currently your logo depicts a contemporary enough message, rather something dated or staid.</p>
<p>I apologise that these criticisms are so negative; however I would like to offer a suggestion that perhaps another way to keep costs down would be to find a smaller design firm or freelance graphic designer who may benefit from a trade of services for something like contract writing advice or professional services; or indeed a young graphic design student who would benefit from an appropriate remuneration agreement.</p>
<p>Best.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, it looks like every other legal related logo on the planet. Now, that isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad. The scales have become the universal symbol for &lsquo;lawyer&rsquo; so if you are looking for people that need a lawyer that are just walking down the street, then hanging that sign probably makes sense.</p>
<p>However, for business correspondence, I don&rsquo;t think you need the symbol to point out the fact that you are a lawyer. As such, i&rsquo;d ditch the scales altogether as it does nothing to make you unique in this field.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I looks too clip art.  It reminds me of a logo done in microsoft word sort of.  There are ways evoking a strong, trustworthy image without being so literal. I agree with ditching the iconography.  There are plenty of typefaces out there that portray what you are trying to say all by themselves.  Try type only.  I like the idea of going to a college and hiring a student if you are trying to cut costs.</div>
