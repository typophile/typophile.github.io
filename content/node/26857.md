  body: ' Is the font available for retail purchase? I am working with a client who
    uses it for their corporate typeface, and have yet to see it anywhere for sale.
    I had looked for it earlier on the FB site and still haven&#39;t been able to
    find it. <BR> <BR>&#40;I haven&#39;t received my copy of the new FB book yet&#41;

  body: The new Font Bureau book divides their fonts up into regular retail fonts
    &#40;available from the usual sources&#41; and &#34;special&#34; families that
    are available directly from FB only. Benton Gothic falls into the latter category,
    but <I>is</I> for sale as near as I can tell.
