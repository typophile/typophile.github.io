  body: Hi, Aaron. I have both the hardcover (1986) and paperback (2003) editions,
    both published by David R. Godine, and as far as I can tell the only difference
    is the cover design. The back cover of the paperback states that Tracy died in
    1995, and the copyright date is still 1986. There are no new forewords, prefaces,
    or other updates to the 2003 paperback.

  body: "David, the request was, \"I'm very curious about typography in general ...
    an introductory book... \"\r\n\r\nI think you assumed that when Victor spoke of
    the characteristics of \"types\", he meant particular typefaces, rather than genres
    of type or typefaces in general.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me (and other people who
    responded) that he is looking for a general introduction, rather than a work themed
    by typeface.\r\n\r\nThat is why I thought your statement, \"...there was nothing
    close to what you are asking for...\" was absurd, as, obviously, there are lots
    of general introductions to typography.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if I had been <em>more</em>
    prejudiced (i.e. taken into account that you are French and may have misinterpreted
    the nuances of the request--spelling errors and all), I would not have offered
    such a literal criticism!\r\n\r\nNonetheless, your work is, I think, as good a
    way as any to get deeper into typography--in fact it may be better than those,
    such as the ones I mentioned, that enforce an author's grand teleological structures.\r\n\r\nLet
    the reader look, enjoy a series of discursive essays, and make up his own mind!"

  body: "Thanks for the book, David.\r\nPlease send me your address, and I'll mail
    you one of my books in return.\r\n\r\nI've read several of the essays in it, and
    my first impression is that you've simplified the genesis and history of the types
    in order to create a grand narrative: myth-building.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there
    is your assertion that Cooper Black had fallen from usage mid century, to be revived
    by the Pet Sounds album cover, a notion which I disproved in a Typophile thread.\r\n\r\nWith
    regards to Futura, you state that, \"...les premiers succ\xE9dan\xE9s de Futura
    apparurent d\xE8s ann\xE9es 1950...\" which is incorrect, as the face was immediately
    plaigiarized by foundries in many countries in the 1930s, e.g. Intertype's Vogue
    of 1930.\r\n\r\nYou explain how DIN typ[eface was \"...d\xE9di\xE9 aux panneaux
    routiers...\" which is incorrect, as it was initially a face used by engineers,
    dating from well before the first autobahn, and its use, upon adoption by the
    DIN in 1936, was not especially connected to autobahn signage, which had very
    few kilometers at that point in time, but was in many media such as type and acetate
    stencils.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I do agree that the format of the book, focusing
    on well-known typefaces with samples of their usage and an accompanying essay,
    is unique and fascinating.\r\n\r\nFor the second edition, please include some
    Shinn types, and I will go a little easier on my criticism :-)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey Nick, you're welcome.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my purpose has never been
    to create a grand narrative, but to give basic biographical information about
    type designers at a time it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so (finding
    today a detailed (as much as possible) biography of Roger Excoffon or Giambattista
    Bodoni is almost impossible for a regular student, at least in France, unless
    you have access to rare and old books in some way). I tried not to simplify too
    much, but the book is indeed an introduction: I also, therefore, tried not to
    make it look too much boring. I tried to talk about as many type creators as possible,
    and also not to go too much over 200 pages. If the book contains some unprecise
    facts, it is because I couldnt get any more precise information at that time.
    I am well aware that it contains some mistakes, it is after all talking about
    a lot of facts that take years to confirm, and I had it read by many people whom
    you can trust when it comes to being precise and reliable in type history; still,
    some mistakes went throught the net, though not that much. I can actually see
    that you focused on the mistakes without talking about the 200 other pages of
    reliable facts - if you know any other book like this one, please tell me so.
    I guess the second edition will be much more precise and in many ways corrected,
    thanks to interventions like yours. But still, I am happy to have produced a book
    which talks extensively about the life of famous and obscure type designers, about
    the genesis of type creation (even if you consider it simplified), and which contains
    at least a crash course on how to choose it well, a starting point into developping
    your own way to do so. And most of all, the layout is clear, rich in colors, not
    too boring (hopefully), so that it may attract students and other people into
    reading it. It's not what you consider a \"perfect book\", it's too simplified,
    etc... but this book is not for you. You don't need it. It's not perfect, I admit
    it, but it's better than doing nothing at all, I guess you will admit this.\r\n\r\nAbout
    Cooper Black: all the sources I checked are pointing to the lack of interest in
    the typeface between 1930 and 1960, and its revival in the sixties mainly due
    to this album cover. I couldnt find the thread you mention, I'd be happy to read
    it.\r\n\r\nAbout Futura: you are right, I should write the 1930's. I will correct
    this in the next edition.\r\n\r\nAbout DIN 1451: it is widely accepted that this
    specific variation of the DIN type system (for engineers indeed, as I wrote in
    my book) was mainly created for use on railways and road signs, a quick look in
    Google and in the articles of Albert Jan Pol will show you that - my mistake if
    I believed it to be true. You obviously have access to information which states
    the opposite, I'd like to see them.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\nps: 8 rue de bretteville,
    14000 caen, france, and thanks in advance."

  body: "David, I looked in some 1960s Playboy magazines from before Pet Sounds in
    1966, and immediately came across the Teachers Scotch campaign, among other uses
    of Cooper Black. If you want to form believable theories about the popularity
    and usage of faces, it's important to look through the mass media of an era first
    hand, and also consider the typographic trade practice, i.e. which fonts are being
    offered by print shops--if they were putting it in their specimen books, it was
    because it was being used.\r\n\r\nPet Sounds was not actually a popular album,
    in fact its critical acclaim is probably partly due to that. If you are looking
    for an influential Cooper Black album cover, this, from 1963, would be a better
    candidate:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/The-Beatles-Twist--Shout-383672_5151.jpg]\r\n\r\n<em>you
    focused on the mistakes without talking about the 200 other pages of reliable
    facts</em>\r\n\r\nYou're right, the vast majority of the book is sharply observed,
    for instance (just opening it at random) some nice comments about Stella and Optima.\r\nI'm
    just an incorrigibly petty typographic nit-picker!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
