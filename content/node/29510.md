body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/squashA_1_6514.jpg]\r\nI'm designing a
  new logo for the Hungarian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_%28sport%29\">Squash</a>
  Federation, and i'm not sure if the mark of my mockup is recognizable enough. I
  was thinking i put here just the mark without any comment, but than i realized it
  would be a silly guessing game, and the logo will be used in a certain context where
  the recognition is easier...\r\n\r\nA few comments on my layout:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>i
  still need to work on the colors, this just the first approach</li>\r\n<li>the kerning
  of the the title is default kerning of the font. Will be finalised at the end.</li>\r\n<li><em>Magyar
  Fallabda Sz\xF6vets\xE9g</em> means Hungarian Squash Federation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAny
  feedback is welcome, thanks,\r\nP\xE9ter\r\n"

    bird with a thin long beak. Maybe the white line is too strong?\r\n\r\nI like
    the blue, some squash balls are that colour, aren't they? (haven't played for
    15 years)"

    the racquet, except that there are other sports that use a similar court layout,
    if the mark was to appear without the text. Like Mili it is years since I played
    squash and the racquets have changed shape a lot since then.\r\n\r\nTim"

      theme? I give it a try. Thanks, for the idea.\r\n\r\nP\xE9ter\r\n\r\n"

    perhaps to generic or abstract. . . Im no Hungarian and its been a while since
    I embarressed myself on the Squash court, but is there some thing here that tells
    me its Hungarian?\r\n\r\nI also agree that the motion of the ball could be worked
    on. Ball seems a little small as well.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

    understand, that this is not working, i sketched a few variations on this, and
    also got some other ideas. Will sent it to this forum later on.\r\n\r\nThanks

    too easily confused with other enclosed court games. I felt that your mark didn't
    make enough of squash's three dimensional quality where the ball could come from
    virtually any direction.\r\n\r\nTim"

    with squash being such a fast paced and dynamic game, I'd expect to see that reflected
