  design rests somewhere between old country (Mesquite) and newer/slick country (clean
  sans-serifs). \r\n\r\nAny ideas, advice or direction would be greatly appreciated.

  body: "(this part deleted; missed the script part in the header)\r\n\r\nAnd I second
    Paul's Zaner recommendation. Sort of like Scarlett Johansson, I'd like anything
    it was on, just to look at it. (I used to say Kim Basinger for things like this,
    but I updated it for the youth here rather than hear \"Kim who?\").\r\n"

  body: I like the font Zanner as well.  Another one to consider with a little age
    to it is <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000104">Dear
    Sarah</a> which has extended characters for different effects.
