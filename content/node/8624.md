  body: That logo is pretty old. I&#39;d say it was almost certainly custom designed
    and I can&#39;t think of any fonts which look exactly like it. If you&#39;re just
    looking for something with a similar feel, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-novarese/ultra/testdrive.html?s=NASA&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Novarese Ultra</a> might work.

  body: There was also a photo display font called Primus that was similar, but I
    don&#39;t know of any digital versions. Phil Martin did a version called Primus
    Malleable that even had the right kind of serif on the A. A little closer than
    Novarese, but not a match.

    form.   <BR> <BR>i&#39;ll try and tweak the Novarese Ultra font. <BR> <BR>Thanks!
