body: "I recently upgraded to MS Word 2008 and I find that some italic versions of
  my font fails to be listed in the font menu. They still function via style command.
  Not all the italics fail to list, only the lighter weights.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering
  what, if anything, has changed in this version of Word to cause this?"

  body: "My weight classes are fine. The style linking actually works in Word 2008,
    it just that some of the italic fonts do not appear in the font menu. When I apply
    the Italic style to a regular weight it does change to the proper italic. Even
    though that italic is not in the font menu.\r\n\r\n"

  body: So maybe that's on purpose? It always worked like this in Word on Windows
    with style-linked fonts.

  body: That would typically indicate some naming incompatibility in the families,
    such that some italic fonts are being recognised as style-linked variants within
    families and others are being recognised as individual typefaces.

  body: "I have also witnessed some strange behavior, very similar to what's described,
    in Word 2008 Mac. It seems to affect only \"super-families\", that is, families
    with more than the usual 4 members. Have not found anything wrong with the font
    data despite numerous investigations of naming, weight class values, PANOSE, etc...
    It really seems to be something with Word 2008 Mac (only).\r\n\r\nWe haven't found
    a workaround; fortunately the actual style-linking seems to function correctly...it's
    just the Font menu entry issue that is a problem."

    that to be absolutely sure that the <em>PostScript name</em> will not generate
    errors, it should be limited to 28 characters. For at least older Mac versions
    of MS Word the <em>Full font name</em> (nameID 4) should not contain more than
    32 characters. One way to circumvent this, is to limit the <em>Compatible Full
    name</em> (nameID 18) for the Mac to this number."

  body: "The name length thing may <em>also</em> be a problem, and should be checked
    out, but I have also seen this behavior in Word 2008 with names that are well
    within those limits.\r\n\r\nOne thing I've noticed is that it is not necessarily
    predictable or even repeatable: for example, installing a family with members
    Light, Light Italic, Regular, Italic, Medium, Medium Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic,
    in one instance it might be the Light Italic that doesn't show in the menu. A
    separate install could omit the Medium Italic. It is this apparent randomness
    that leads me to believe there's a Word 2008 issue at play, and not necessarily
    a font naming or styling issue."

    a Word 2008 issue at play [...]</em>\r\n\r\nAfter running some extra tests in
    Word 2008 for Mac, version 12.2.1, under Leopard 10.5.4. (Server, because of image
    file), I tend to agree with Joshua. By removing fonts (after quitting Word) that
    didn't appear initially in the Word font menu and reinstalling these (without
    cleaning caches), the fonts in question showed up after a spinning wheel session
    in the restarted Word. Therefor it looks to me a matter of font menu refreshment,
    especially because the \u2018hidden\u2019 fonts seem to work via the style keys.
    Also the problem does not seem to be restricted to OpenType (CFF/TTF) fonts.\r\n"
