body: "Hey there everybody,\r\nI've designed a Persian font (Arabic letters) in Fontlab
  5 and exported it, but after I tested it in Adobe Illustrator to check if there's
  anything wrong with it I encountered a strange problem:\r\nSome specific letters
  don't follow the kerning values I've designated to them when used before or after
  one another. For example, the letter \"\u0627\" (alef) doesn't follow the kerning
  values when used after \"\u0631\" (Re), \"\u0632\" (Ze), \"\u0698\" (Je). There's
  also a problem with Re, Ze and Je when used after one another.\r\nI've double checked
  the kernings and found no problem with them whatsoever. The only thing that I could
  think of as a potential cause was that I used an existing font as a reference to
  put the letters in the right place, I thought the original font might have additional
  properties which are causing the problem.\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\nThanks"
