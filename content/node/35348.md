  body: "I think 'hand'-colored would perhaps be as likely (the quotes is because
    it could have been done on computer too). If you used a font like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/\">Eagle
    Bold</a> for your outline, the rest would be coloring it somehow. (I see the R
    is not the same, so maybe there is a better Deco style candidate, or you could
    customize the R from the P.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    doesn't seem to be any overshoot on the 'N' and 'A'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
