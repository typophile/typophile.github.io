  body: "\"Georgia or Calibri\"?  I think you need to press the client to articulate
    what they don't find suitable about Franklin Gothic, and find out what they are
    trying to achieve with the alternates suggested.  It is really critical to the
    feedback process to fully understand what the client is trying to say, especially
    when they are not used to expressing those ideas in terms that are not solutions
    to the problem, but rather defining the problem and goals.  Saying 'use Calibri'
    is a solution, but what problem and goal is it addressing?  You need to know the
    answer to that question to find a solution.\r\n\r\np.s. you can also explain that
    your job is to design effective communication, not discover things that the client
    happens to like.  Focus on the message and the audience, not the personal preferences
    of the client."

    more than two weights?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe standard ITC Franklin Gothic family has
    four weights, I believe \u2014 Book, Medium, Demi, and Heavy.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GeorgiaPro\">Georgia
    Pro</a> has four weights \u2014 Light, Regular, Bold, and Black \u2014 if you\u2019re
    just looking to \u201Cmake the client happy.\u201D"
