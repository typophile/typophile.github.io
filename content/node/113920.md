  using that font.\r\nIt looks like College font, but I cant identify it. Please,
  help!\r\nIf you'll find something like this but not the same - post your answer
  too!\r\nThanks!"

    is worth a shot. Found [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/studio-k/alma-mater|Alma
    Mater]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thomas-kaeding/undergrad-exscribed|Undergrad
    Exscribed]] this way.\r\nHave also a look to the [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=104|Fancy
    > Old School]] section at DaFont, there should be some good ones (possibly including
    a rough effect)."
