  body: Sorry can't help... but this is very charming and i'd like to know what this
    is. Even though my gut tells me that this might not be available digitally.

    to Antique Olive Nord.

    like the font shown in the '98 Big Yellow (FontBook) as Information BQ Bold Extended.
    I can't find it being sold anywhere, so apparently Berthold dropped it, or re-named
    it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    (at least in terms of present technology fonts). Geez, I was 24 when 'Bullitt'
    was new, so THAT's OLD by my book!\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
