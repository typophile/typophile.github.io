i started learning graphic design just a year before, so im a beginner. just wanted to make something nice like Marian does.

The stuff about the rules is a pile of crap, no offence. :)
1. Who says script fonts <em>should</em> look like calligraphy?
2. All caps... I actually see 'wku' in lowercase, if you compare them to T and F's from the other lines.

Hmm… lettering should at least resemble letters, otherwise it's a code, and not script[ure]…
It seems "fonts" have nothing to do with that kind of illustration treatment, as much as I appreciated Lee Schultz Antionette and Salome.
In a similar vein, I think Missionary by Miles Newlyn is a good example to indicate an extreme limit you can reach if you wish to write a text meant to be read, and not decoded, after which letters become mere illustrations.

For example, which has been the idea behind making Restraint as a typeface? Id' be curious to know…
It's a pattern generator in the form of a typeface, and it helps by mechanizing the ornamentation elements, but it's no longer a typeface.</div>

Well, they <strong>are</strong> letters? :) I asked 'who says script fonts should look like calligraphy', since Victor Curran said that that is a rule. A script -- or maybe <em>lettering</em> is a better word -- only has to look like calligraphy if the designer wants it to. 

That they <em>should</em> look like calligraphy is a rediculous claim/rule, in my opinion, which is proven by Marian Bantjes and Aron.</div>

about the rules...

Wesley,
no drawings on paper, just did it with vectors, it was a half a day's work. and i did in in flash :D, so its not really professional, for example the hairlines aren't shrinking, there's only a gradient on them :)
(don't ask why flash and not illustrator... i didn't even know how to use illustrator at that time)

		<div class="commentbody">Quincunx: You don't understand what I meant: they are letters, but they are used in a way that becomes more illustration than word, so the text meaning is the second thing you get.
I am not saying this is not good, I just said, as you agree, that this is lettering illustration, or art, as in English art seems to be used for any graphic endeavor.

The fact that one might like it or not is not the key, since taste may be pretty deceiving.
I have tried to incorporate such abstract treatments in typeface design, and I find more interest in this than the simple use of letters in illustration, that's what I mean.
But of course, being an illustration, it depends on the whole essence of its communication as desired by the author.

For example, I prefer a lot Áron's typeface [[http://flickr.com/photos/mil3n/|Milen Serif]]. I would make alternative attempts to re-evaluation of the weight distribution (especially on [c], [s] and [y]), but the alphabet it is done with great consciousness, and the layout choosen to present it and choice of colors are immersive and successful.

Of course, Victor Curran comment did not make much sense.
