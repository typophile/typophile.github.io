  for my image to be printed in. Then I have to wrap an electric guitar without having
  any folds, bubbles or creases.\r\nAny help in figuring this out would be much appreciated.

  body: "I remember seeing something about Peavey guitars using <a href=\"http://www.agriffmaster.com/about.php\">ArtGuitars</a>
    for photographic decorations. I don't have personal experience with what you describe.
    Our guitars are either laminated wood or painted directly on the instrument. \r\n\r\nThe
    vinyl wrap suggestion sounds promising! \r\n\r\nIf the guitar is a bolt-on neck,
    are you covering the body only? Do you already have the guitar you are decorating?"

    hand work and yes they are \"bolt-on\" necks.  I've already reached out to the
    Alchemic thread site.  Getting closer....I will try artguitars.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\ntimothyvan"
