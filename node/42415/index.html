  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">When you purchase workhorse fonts, why do you do it? Is it because you need a complex font for complex hierarchies? To use with existing client identity systems? To develop new identity systems? Because you have a limited type budget and want to cover all your bases when you buy type? </div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">First, let's define workhorse. For me, it means (a) there are at least three weights with italic for each; (b) it's a serif family, because sans-serifs, in corporate work, are used as a secondary or highlight font, one that harmonizes with the primary serif family; (c) the x-height is high enough to permit the base-weight roman to bloom at 9 pt, whereas many of our flavor-of-the-month fonts bloom at 10pt or higher; (c) the base weight is strong, contrasted, and dark enough to be crisp and legible at 6pt, which similarly leaves off many fashionable fonts: in particular, the finer serifs have to hold up clearly as the point size goes down; (d) the italics have to match the romans in their proportions, unlike, say, Gill's Joanna; and (e) both oldstyle and liner figures are available and can be alternated easily.

For me, the perfect workhorse, fulfilling all these requirements, is Stone Serif (from ITC, not Adobe), with Stone Sans as the perfect sans-serif foil. It blooms at 9pt, there are three weights, all well contrasted from each other, and the italics look even better than the romans. Also, the letterforms are fat instead of slightly condensed. Warnock, for instance, is a fine workhorse for all these reasons, but I place it below Stone because, like Minion, its letterforms are slightly condensed in look producing, for my eyes, a cramped look in texts. Galliard would be a workhorse for me if its italics were not so fussy--but otherwise I admire it greatly.

You choose a workhorse family for organizational work because coherent corporate design requires one primary serif text family for everything, punctuated by one well-matched sans-serif text family for highlights and sidebars. This is the classic approach, and it's classic for damned good reasons that hold up over time.</div>

There's little to criticize, all of them being utterly consistent and clean in their details and their construction. They hold up well under almost all situations, and if push came to shove, any number of them could be relied up to do a steady, serviceable job on almost any job.

		<div class="commentbody">For me a workhorse font also has to have either open type or a full expert set. (As I've said before) I design a lot of cookbooks and art books and the former especially can require a lot of different variations within the font, fractions, small caps, various weights. A workhorse font (for me) also doesn't call too much attention to itself.

I'm not a fan of the Stone family aesthetically. Depending on my purposes I might use Adobe Garamond or Caslon or Jensen Pro. I might also use Thesis, which nicely has both sans and serif. Other fonts that serve this purpose for me have included Bembo, Bulmer, Dante, Columbus, Fournier, Perpetua, Sabon. There are plenty of others that I don't have licensed. Stefan Hattenbach has fleshed out his font families very nicely.

For sans I often turn to Meta (haven't purchased the Serif yet). Klavika if I want something more modern.</div>
