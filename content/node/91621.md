  freelance design company's logotype, and would love it if anyone had any suggestions
  as what to use as a sans-serif to compliment it?\r\n\r\nMain applications will be
  stationery, business cards, letterheads, invoice, etc.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any
  thoughts!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. "

  body: Din is looking pretty sharp, I did have it in Helvetica Neue but the uprightness/less
    extended-ness of Din seems to suit Ionic better in contrast. Thanks!
