  a CV, and am using various variants of Arno Pro (Semibold Subhead, Regular, Caption).
  Then I decide to see what it'd look like in Brioso Pro; select all, go to the font
  menu, pick Brioso Pro ... and all the work in picking optical sizes is obliterated:
  everything is in Brioso Pro Caption. Is there a fix for this? Or do other word processing
  programs (as opposed to InDesign) have the capability I'm missing?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
