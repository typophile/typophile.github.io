body: "I am interested in having my vector designs turned into functioning fonts.
  I would like to outsource this part of the job though. The font I have designed
  is quite simple. I am hoping someone can direct me toward someone reputable. The
  fonts are odd and geometric, and wouldn't require pinpoint perfection.\r\n\r\nNo
  doubt this has been asked about before, but I wasn't able to find a thread. If so
  please drop me a link.\r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nRuss"

  body: "Filip, I'm delighted to see that you've cloned yourself!  ;-)\r\n\r\nRuss,
    please also consider my services for this project - you can email me for a quote:
    hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\nFYI, the fee will depend on the following things:
    the number of glyphs, whether they're all at the same scale, what level of screen
    rendering quality you desire, and how quickly you need it done.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    // www.ferfolio.com\r\n\r\nKind regards!\r\n\r\nPS: I think you've come to the
    only forum where you can ask people to design a typeface... you will probably
    have a lot of (awesome) offers from type designers, and no one will reply 'Do
    whaaat???'\r\n"
