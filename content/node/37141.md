body: "Hello everyone, nice to meet you all, first time poster here and all that :-)\r\n\r\nI'll
  try to keep this trim. I'm a student in a Belgian school of translators, starting
  my final year. The \"master's thesis\" (or \"dissertation\"? Not sure about the
  English term. Whatever) I'm supposed to do will consist mainly in a translation
  (English to French) of a short book, or of selected chapters from a longer book.
  And as I recently found out typography is a subject I really dig, I've decided to
  work on a book about just that. Still choosing between \"Stop Stealing Sheep\" and
  \"Type and Typography\", but this isn't the point.\r\n\r\nNow to the question. When
  it comes to producing text content, which is what I'm doing, I'm fairly sure there
  are much better pieces of software than the usual OOo or MS Word. I dunno, maybe
  allowing better control of text formatting, more features, whatever. I'm a newbie
  to this, but I s'pose there's GOT to be something better than the word processors
  I've been using so far. And since my translation is about typography, I figure using
  the best tools available would be a valuable addition to the final work.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? Or should I just stick to Open Office? Here my requirements:\r\n1) Free or
  cheap. I'm a poor student.\r\n2) Windows or Linux. I don't own a mac.\r\n3) Possibility
  to save or convert my work in Microsoft Word format without too much hassle. I know,
  I know, it sucks, but it's officially required by the school. However, having a
  more \"professional\" file included as an annex would kick ass. Perhaps I'd even
  use that one to print, and the .doc to give to the school as requested.\r\n\r\nVoil\xE0.
  Sorry for not having searched much on the Web, I've always found community answers
  were much more useful than search engine answers. However, don't hesitate to just
  post a link and tell me to figure it out from there. Your help would be very appreciated."

  body: "Nice to have you posting here, Simon. That's pretty cool that you're able
    to integrate an interest in typography into your dissertation.\r\n\r\nFor professional
    layout, the standard is [[http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/|Adobe InDesign]]
    (now in version CS3), which gives you far more flexibility than MS Word ever could.
    [[http://www.indesignsecrets.com/why-use-indesign-instead-of-ms-word.php|Here's]]
    a short post that goes over a few reasons why InDesign's better. After you learn
    it, I doubt you'll be able to even imagine laying out something like a dissertation
    in Word, especially when it comes to typographic refinement. Plus, InDesign comes
    with a bevy of high-quality fonts perfect for a dissertation without having to
    spring for those, too.\r\n\r\nPeople also use [[http://www.quark.com/products/xpress/|Quark]],
    although the numbers are, as far as I know, going down each year. I haven't used
    it so I can't really comment, but most people I know choose InDesign when they
    can.\r\n\r\nThe bad news -- both of these are quite expensive. Two pieces of good
    news, however: 1) You're a student, which means you may be eligible for student
    discounts on software and other goodies. As a student myself, I use studica.com,
    where I could get InDesign CS3 for $200 (U.S.) instead of $699 from Adobe. It
    looks like they sell in Europe as well, but you should check -- there are several
    of these academic resellers around, so choose whichever seems best to you. 2)
    You can download the InDesign CS3 trial to use free in all its glory for 30 days
    [[http://www.adobe.com/downloads/|here]]. If after experimenting you think it's
    worth it (and you should if you pick up a book from the library or buy one about
    how to use it), then you can buy the program.\r\n\r\nAddressing your other two
    requirements, InDesign is available for Windows and can export its files to RTF
    (under File>Export...), which Word can read and print. You can also easily import
    Word files (File>Place), if that makes a difference."

  body: "Welcome, Simon. I\u2019m something of a newcomer here myself, tho\u2019 I\u2019ve
    been quickly giving the place a workout and I can tell you, hands down, that this
    may be very nearly the most helpful group of people I\u2019ve ever encountered
    on a forum.\r\n\r\nOkay, that said, get away from MS Word and Open Office\u2014perfectly
    good tools for what their purpose is, but not page layout software. (I often liken
    doing book design and layout in Word to whacking a nail into a wall with the flat
    side of a heavy wrench. Eventually you will pound that nail in, I suppose, but
    it\u2019s not the tool made for the job and you might have unintended results
    along the way that cost you more time and money overall.)\r\n\r\nAlthough I keep
    hearing how InDesign is rapidly replacing Quark, the lion\u2019s share of the
    books I get from publishers and book packagers are to be done in Quark, now up
    to version 7.3, I believe. But I am also beginning to get requests for InDesign.
    I\u2019m still a little more used to Quark, but InDesign\u2014although CS3 is
    available, I\u2019ve yet to make the move from CS2, which suits me fine yet\u2014is
    a great program, easy to learn (if you apply yourself  and put in the time), and
    seems particularly familiar to anyone who used PageMaker previously.\r\n\r\nI
    second the notion that it\u2019s a good deal to have the opportunity to indulge
    an interest in typography into the work of getting out your dissertaion.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with it.\r\n\r\nStephen Tiano\r\nBook Designer, Page Compositor & Layout

    cost a penny.

  body: "Thank you all for your input. So I've learnt newbie lesson #1: word processing
    and layout/design are two different things. Since I won't be using any fancy layout
    functions (saying my school is conservative in its requirements would be an understatement),
    I guess I'll stick to word processors, and perhaps deal with another piece of
    software when it comes to printing the physical copies... if I'm not in a rush
    to meet deadlines.\r\n\r\nWhat actually had me wondering about the adequacy of
    word processors was their incomplete support of, for instance, small caps or non-lining
    numerals. But spending days or weeks learning a whole new program, for a result
    probably too small to even be noticed by the professors? Nah.\r\n\r\nStill, I've
    bookmarked Scribus and will remember InDesign as the way to go once I'm rolling
    in dough... 200 dollars is about what I spend in food every month, so buying even
    a discount copy of a professional application isn't an option. And stealing is,
    well, wrong. Thanks again!"
