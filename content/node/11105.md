  is big enough to be printed at 4pt. <BR> <BR>i tried to look for the better readability

  body: 'ruben!  <BR>  <BR>First font, my foot! It&#39;s hard to believe you&#39;re  <BR>just
    starting out in type design when you have  <BR>such a great grasp of form and
    consistency.  <BR>  <BR>I like the base shape, the rounded corners and   <BR>the
    angled terminals. I&#39;m sure this face will   <BR>lend itself well to a bold
    weight too.  <BR>  <BR>Two small concerns:  <BR>  <BR>- The &#39;M&#39; distracted
    me immediately. I&#39;d like to  <BR>see the middle come down a bit to match the   <BR>other
    caps.  <BR>  <BR>- The &#39;4&#39;s counter is much smaller than any other  <BR>glyph.
    Maybe an open topped &#39;4&#39; is in order.  <BR>  <BR>It&#39;s very cool overall
    and there is certainly  <BR>a market for this look. Peter Bruhn of Fountain   <BR>might
    be watching this critique closely. See his  <BR><a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/mayo.asp"

  body: ' Ruben, I agree with Stephen: I think you&#39;re lying.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously,
    pardon my language, but this is one goddam good design. I do happen to have a
    fetish for designs that combine the mechanical and the organic, but Oban &#40;great
    name, btw&#41; really is class. <BR> <BR>Stephen&#39;s suggestion for the numeral
    &#34;4&#34; is right on, but for the UC &#34;M&#34; I think it needs more than
    just a lower middle: it needs a curvier middle. Also: the &#34;K&#34; is imbalanced,
    the &#34;Q&#34; is amazing, the &#34;X&#34; too wide. <BR> <BR>In the lc, &#34;k&#34;
    and &#34;x&#34; have the same problems as above, but overall I&#39;m salivating
    to see some text. <BR> <BR>Non-alphanumerics: The exclamation/question color needs
    help, the dollar sign is the only one with a double bar that I&#39;ve ever liked,
    the ampersand rocks, the BP is too stiff, the Pilcrow is great, the Euro looks
    forced. <BR> <BR>More, please!! <BR> <BR>hhp '

    was great. Overall a very nice feeling, friendly without looking corny. Will you

  body: ' Let me add my praise for this specimen. I love the squarish forms and gentle
    tapers. The whole alphabet is very exciting and has enormous potential. <BR> <BR>The
    lower leg of the K seems a bit thin, and the round corners of the Z seem inconsistent
    with the way you&#39;ve handled similar junctions.  <BR> <BR>As for the punctuation,
    the letterforms seem close - I think I&#39;d need to see the punctuation in context
    to judge their compatibility. '

  body: ' thanks a lot, for each comment, I&#39;ll take in consideration each of them,
    for soure. <BR> <BR>i&#39;m finishing some other works these next days, but as
    soon as i can i will post some corrections and also a text preview. by the  way
    i tried to use the font in flash to post it here but the same curves that work
    perfectly in freehand sometimes doesn&#39;t look good on flash  but other times
    do. i dont understand wy, but i don&#39;t really use flash usualy so maybe i&#39;m
    doing something wrong. <BR> <BR>by the way, it realy is my first font but i&#39;m
    working on it for some time ago, and in the last few years i had read a lot about
    type design, even before i started to draw these one and i had talked with some
    friens and done some research. <BR>so maybe that&#39;s the reasons, <BR>thanks
    a lot for the compliments, <BR>i gave my best to it. <BR> <BR>thanks, again, and
    see you as soon as i can, bring you more news. '

  body: ' Concerning Flash: <BR>I&#39;ve noticed that cubic bezier curves &#40;the
    kind that PostScript uses&#41; seem to get distorted more than quadratics &#40;which
    TrueType uses&#41;. Translation: Try exporting the font as a TT &#40;of course
    after you move the letterforms from Freehand to Fontographer - or Fontlab&#41;.

  body: Ruben, this is really nice. I&#39;m seeing that the leg of the UC K is too
    small or doesn&#39;t extend far enough to the right. It actually seems to jump
    left and right a little when I look at it. <BR> <BR>I like the feeling of this.
    Kind of reminds me of the letters in the Sezession House designed by JM Olbrich.
