    be a custom made logo.

    on WhatTheFont but not exact...they want a poster with just the logo on but do
    not have the font...\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Those simple lines should be rather easy to trace in a drawing program. I
    found the shape of the P in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/century-gothic/\">Century
    Gothic</a> to be fairly close, but the A was a bit too wide, and the stroke was
    also a bit thicker in the regular weight. (Adding a leg to the P to make your
    R would be easy)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
