body: "I Would like to hear some feedback in this logo design. The mark says \"Al
  Qasr in Arabic which means The Palace in english. I'm not quite sure if I did the
  calligraphy just fine as my knowledge in Arabic language is close to none. \r\n\r\nThank
  you for looking!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Identity_5205.jpg]"

  body: The mark is really nice! The kerning in "THE PALACE" needs some work though.
    Look at the space between each letter, and compare it in pairs.

  body: I hope you can use the mark for something, it's really nice. By the way, the
    long tag line ("The Palace is a royal house...") reads kind of awkwardly to a
    native English speaker (not sure if you are one or not, or who wrote it).
