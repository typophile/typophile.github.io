body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nAfter four years of happy working with LeMondeSans accompanying
  LeMondeJournal in a business mag I thought it's time for a change.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMonde_4106.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeal
  candidate to stand in for LeMondeSans should:\r\n<ul><li>have at least 3 font weights
  (4-5 are most welcome),</li>\r\n<li>have an accompanying condensed family for use
  in short portions of texts in infographs (not a must),</li>\r\n<li>cover variety
  of functions: comfortable reading in circ. 8-9 pt in sidebar texts, subheads in
  body in 12-14 pt, sidebar titles in over 18 pt and titles in brochures in really
  big sizes,</li>\r\n<li>OSF and small caps are very welcome,</li>\r\n<li>CE characters
  are very welcome,</li>\r\n<li>Open Type is preferred font format.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nFonts
  being under consideration so far are FF Quadraat Sans, FF Unit, Fedra Sans Alt,
  DTL Prokylon and Stalemate.\r\n\r\nU.S. edition of the mag went for Univers family
  some time ago and I'd like to try something different.\r\n\r\nPlease share your
  thoughts on what in your opinion would be the best choice to accompany LeMondeJournal.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nAntoni"

    it quite hard to recommend something, it depends on how much \"change\" you want
    and can't really compare to LeMonde Journal regarding relative x-height etc. just
    from your image\u2026 I'd kickstart by browsing the Hoefler&Frere-Jones site at
    http://www.typography.com probably\u2026 \r\nOr have you ever thought of pairing
    Meta and Meta Serif when the later will finally have been released?"

  body: "<cite>You could try Budweiser instead\u2026 :-)</cite>\r\n\r\nI assure you
    I don't avoid it :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI want a \"change\" to be easily spotted by casual
    eye of a reader. But it shouldn't be too \"modern-like\" (eg. Klavika, Engel,
    Din, Vista) at the same time. \r\n\r\nIn fact I put the Whitney from Hoefler&Frere-Jones
    on my short-list, but wasn't able to get any vector based specimen, so abandoned
    it for a moment.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons beyond me changing the body font (LMJournal)
    is not possible. \r\n\r\nI updated the initial post and added a pdf sample.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAntoni\r\n\r\n"

    But it lacks of Condensed, OTF-Format, CE (?). Not a big help, i know :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm a big fan of Bil'ak/Typotheque, so I think Fedra Sans Alt would be a very
    good choise. I don't know how it pairs with LeMonde Journal though, you should
    check that out as well.

    I like both Shaker and Bliss but I just feel they won't be good (a bit too bland)
    for the layout - as well as gothic typefaces for other reasons.\r\n\r\n<strong>I
    updated </strong> the initial post with pdf comparing selected typefaces with
    Le Monde Journal. I know it's hard to say much from it, but maybe some of you
    could give some opinion. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAntoni"

    which I didn't before because I thought it had a bit more attitude than you wanted.

    feeling - and that's actually good for the mag. \r\nI updated a pdf in initial

  body: Since you liked Amplitude, I'll suggest you take a quick look through the
    thread I started a few months ago <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/33546>here</a>.
    Amplitude was something I was strongly considering (I went with Shaker for my
    newspaper, ultimately), so you may find that the other types mentioned in the
    thread might be candidates for your magazine. None of them jumped out at me as
    particularly amazing candidates for your design, but I didn't think you'd like
    Amplitude, either ...

  body: 'As to narrowing down your choices, it''s hard to say; they''re all quite
    nice, so it''s whichever one your gut/wallet/criteria tell you. But two, I don''t
    think, are quite ideal: Meta, which is a bit overused if you''re going for a change,
    and Quadraat, which I think doesn''t fit so well stylistically (i.e. Le Monde
    is too modern for it). Both would still work if you like them, though.'

  body: "@ auricfuzz: thanks for the link, glad you found your solution. Unfortunately
    I didn't find there typefaces that would suit my purpose. But hey, accidental
    (followed a Parisine link) I found at long absent in my browser http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeJournal
    that I can upgrade my Ps Type1 Le Monde Journal to new Open Type version! \r\n\r\n@
    Stefan H: nothing to thank for:) your typefaces are awesome! I got printed specimen
    of your Stalemate, Remontoire, Tarocco and Delicato stick to the board over my
    desk. What a pity they don't include Polish diacritics, even in Graficz. Can't
    work without these. BTW - does your EULA permits adding this characters to the
    font? You got all elements designed: \"ogonek\" for a-ogonek \"\u0105\" and e-ogonek
    \"\u0119\", \"abovedot\" for z-abovedot \"\u017C\",  \"acute\" for z-acute \"\u017A\"
    and c-acute \"\u0107\". It's so close... :(\r\n\r\nPS. Your specimens design is
    really great!\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nAntoni"
