    mark. In other words, it's a useless file, no matter how hard you huff and puff.\r\n\r\nI
    have been around Hebrew files to typeset, and have run into every imaginable problem.\r\n\r\nThe
    latest problem of the exclamation marks is related to the solution: Unicode, which
    assigns a code value to every letter, symbol, or glyph belonging to most every
    language of the world.\r\n\r\nHowever, transfer of data by one userto another,
    when each user uses a different software program poses a small challenge. Unfortunately,
    one user chooses a file format that doesn't support Unicode, and the resulting
    file only contains exclamation marks.\r\n\r\nThis is like any good invention.
    Instead of trying to repair the results, it is wiser and best to simply start
    over again from before the error happenned."

  body: "> Was it a helpful hint?\r\n\r\nThat does help anwering the initial question,
    namely what to do when a text that does not want to display. I did not tell you
    but the text that may not want to display is http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/morfix.txt.
    It is a text file. As soon as you can manage to display its content, you can usually
    copy and paste as you did.\r\n\r\nThe problem is thus finding a first way to display.
    One way is to use <code>recode</code> and produce a utf-8 encoded replacement.
    Another way is to use TextEdit on the macintosh because TextEdit accepts ISO-8859-8
    encoded text inputs (and can write utf-8 files). Another way is to add a few lines
    on top and bottom of morfix.txt to transform it into an html file, and specify
    that the charset is windows-1255. That is exactly how I produced the link morfix.html.\r\n\r\nThere
    may be other tricks to display. Of course, you could use yourself Notepad++ to
    transform the .txt file into the html file the way I did and then use some browser
    and finally copy/paste. It however seems that Notepad++ still cannot do what TextEdit
    does, i.e. do it directly. That is what I wanted to know. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that is good on plain text, or some html documents. For me that's enough, since
    I almost exclusively typeset with LaTeX and LaTeX inputs are text files (and LaTeX
    can also handle various encodings). In fact, I need to recode only when colleagues
    tell me they can't use my files. For those professionals that require more sophisticated
    inputs I am afraid life may not be that easy."
