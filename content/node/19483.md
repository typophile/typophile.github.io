  sailboat. The sailboat name is Esprit and we are looking for a font that \"captures\"
  this name below. The definition of esprit is liveliness of mind or spirit; sprightliness.\r\n\r\nThe
  fonts that we are considering are:\r\n\r\nJeffriana\r\nMarmalade\r\nMr. De Haviland\r\nValentina
  Joy\r\nMinistry Script\r\nLoveLight\r\nUpDock\r\nSarah Script\r\n\r\nThanks for
  any help that you can offer!"

    target=\"new\">ITC Esprit</a>![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Esprit_ital.png]\r\n\r\nJust
    kidding! :-)\r\n\r\nIn all honesty, why search for a \"font\".\r\nIt's a \"one-off\"
    to be cut in vinyl, so why not have a custom logo?\r\nSo much more impressive
    than straight typesetting for a boat's name."

    body: Thanks for the input, everyone. Jan, I don't know the specifics yet as to
      what kind of sailboat it is. I'm waiting for a picture from my client and will
      upload it here when I receive it. Thanks again.
