body: "I'm looking for a kind of do-it-yourself lettering signage system that used
  to be all over the place, in the UK at least, for house names and numbers particularly.\r\n\r\nEach
  letter was printed on its own brushed gold, or sometimes silver coloured self adhesive
  aluminium plate. What made it distinctive was that the lettering was always sloped,
  and so each plate was too -- a parallelogram.\r\n\r\nI know a picture would make
  this easier but I can't find one!\r\n\r\nI've had a good look around on the web
  and in local hardware stores but I don't think I've seen it on sale for at least
  5 years.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on the tradename/manufacturer/sources?\r\n\r\nCheers"

    PC, but think it might have been a heavy condensed Univers)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lettering_4875.gif]

    Mainly used for mailboxes, IIRC.

    will look around a bit more.\r\n\r\nI got a bit obsessed by this system as a kid
    and used to buy letters with my pocket money.\r\n\r\nIt always amused me when
    people compensated for the slanting letters by mounting it with a rising baseline.\r\n\r\nI
    was that kind of kid."
