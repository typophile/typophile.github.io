  sticks showing matrices in line and a specimen sheet, not sure if it will appear
  large enough, but will scan anew if need be.\r\nThe fun in the Ludlow is the setting
  or composing is much like setting cast type or foundry type by hand in a composing
  stick. one gets to adjust word space and some letter space and ligature mats are
  available as well as some swash."
