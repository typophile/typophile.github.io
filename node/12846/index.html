  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">For a while now I haven't followed the Type-ID section at all. One reason is that helps me spend less time on Typophile, but another is that I feel inadequate in the company of the planet's best font hounds! But I have noticed (through the [old] search facility) that some ID threads evolve into quite interesting discussions, ones I'd love to be exposed to. And I suspect a few others are in my position, so I have a suggestion:

Could we have a Best of Type-ID compilation? It would include threads with juicy discussion but also exceptional cases of font sleuthing, and maybe great humor, etc. Assuming Yves is willing to spend <strong>any</strong> time on something like this, what would reduce his load a lot would be if people (especially the pack of alpha hounds*) nominated memorable threads, or even divvied up chronological chunks** of all the ID threads and went through them. It could be a long-term thing, as people have the time.

* In fact one of the alphas could be the project kahuna instead of Yves.

** You could give me a chunk too.

Also, it seems like a lot of threads didn't make it to the new version, and those that did are missing Stephen's comments for some obscure reason...</div>

That was me. But I think I intercapped it -"StepHen"- and that makes it harder to find? So maybe try searching on "stephen" + "hhp" from around 2.5 years ago. Or maybe it was "Step-Hen", since I love hyphens to much.

Missing stuff: my guess is the system processed mine, then it needed a vacation. Seriously, I've noticed that posts from anonymous users for one seem to be missing; but that doesn't explain Stephen's missing stuff. Maybe it has to do with having multiple login accounts? I've always had this one, but I remember early on (like maybe 3.5 years ago) there was some sort of purge and most people created new accounts (thereby exagerating my [relative] post-count even more...) and maybe the system only revives posts of <strong>currently</strong> registered users?

Stephen, the moderator posts were not properly batch processed along with all the rest of the users' info and posts. The same thing happened to Tiffany.
