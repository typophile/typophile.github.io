  paths and there are certain glyphs (K and V) so far that shut FontLab down for some
  reason, it just quits out of nowhere. Also, when I'm going through the face making
  parallel paths, my keyboard shortcuts will stop working and then eventually FontLab
  will just shut off..\r\n\r\nAnybody know what's going on?"
