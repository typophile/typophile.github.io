    type. If you do see how the curves and spurs and relative widths are affected
    by being 12 pt and below. I think if you put readability at small sizes as your
    goal, it will help decide what direction you want to go with it, and get one font
    design.  <BR> <BR>On the other hand if you go for a maybe different or related
    display type, you will be more free to be expressive and innovative. <BR> <BR>Generally
    your letters are really beautiful, but it is said that a text type is &#39;not
    a collection of beautiful letters but a beautiful collection of letters&#39; &#40;Walter

    the question of the original sharp terminal on the a, you might compare Kent Lew&#39;s
    Whitman, at FontBureau and his own site kentlew.com. I don&#39;t like the sharp
    a terminal on Perpetua, but Kent Lew made it work beautifully on his Whitman.

  body: 'I am just now doing my first face, a text face, and you are now at a point
    where the mysteries - to me - of spacing, relative widths, and thick thin contract
    become very important. One thing I have found is that the thickness of the horizontal
    part of round letters is very important, and that the thins get visually get thinner
    faster than the fats as you print out in text size. Thus for text faces the horzontals
    in my opinion shouldn&#39;t be too thin.  <BR> <BR>I would try reducing the contrast,
    and see how it looks in text sizes.  <BR> <BR>Also, I think the spacing needs
    work. It looks tight to me, but this might just be some letters. Also to me 9
    point and 12 point are different animals. I believe that at 8 point the Adobe
    opticals &#39;caption size&#39; generally are wider, looser and bolder.  <BR>
    <BR>The subtlety of the soft curves you have drawn get lost in small sizes, but
    this isn&#39;t necessarily a disaster, as people will see them more clearly in
    titles.  <BR> <BR>Also, I would say with the problems you say you are having with
    the sharp version, to try also reducing the contrast. This will mean changing
    the look of the terminals, but you might find a good solution.  <BR> <BR>One more
    issue that I don&#39;t understand is whether you have to do hinting first to get
    a decent read on the print out at 1200 dpi on a laser printer. Are you PDF&#39;s
    hinted? Are PDFs in general hinted?   <BR> <BR>Oh also the italic is great.   '

  body: '&#62;a bit rude  <BR> <BR>No, of course not. But the reason for not more
    commentary is probably that it is not very clear where you want go with this.  <BR>
    <BR>I went last week for the first time to a type event, the &#39;Making Faces&#39;
    seminar in New York. The two from House Industries, Font Bureau&#39;s David Berlow,
    Matthew Carter, and Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones.  <BR> <BR>What I was really struck
    by in these folks who are producing and selling a lot of fonts is that the &#39;brief&#39;
    for the font was critical. In the case of House Industries, it was more aesthetic:
    they wanted to take lettering they admired, and make functional type from it.
    For the others, it was producing fonts for specific purposes within a publication.  <BR>
    <BR>You have a lot of good ideas here and elsewhere, and a gift for elegant shapes,
    but I think you may be helped by a more clear brief for these fonts - either your
    own, or some one else&#39;s. For example, with your &#39;Eliza&#39;, you had a
    clear brief, and just produced the thing.  <BR> <BR>The scientist Michael Faraday
    kept a slip of paper in his top desk drawer. It said &#39;work, finish, publish.&#39;
    I wish I always took this advice, but I think it&#39;s good. You will have chances
    to revisit old ideas once you do them for one purpose.'

    <BR>Both of your suggestions shall get me thinking. I know what I mostly want

    curves, I like subtle softness without being cutesy about it. Seems to make it

    is making sense.&#41; <BR> <BR>The monocular form is too modular with respect
    to the rest of the alphabet. It is very legible, but does not contribute much
    divergence to boumas. The conventional, closed binocular form is richly divergent,
    but it&#39;s way too complex - it violates the &#34;rules of belonging&#34; of
    the Latin alpahabet too strongly. Topologically only the &#34;B&#34; &#40;which
    is way less frequent, and bowl-adjacent&#41; is equal to it, and then there&#39;s
    the ear on top of that! Giving it an open bottom -especially with a diagonal join
    that swells- ties it nicely into shapes like the &#34;s&#34;, while reducing &#34;alien&#34;
    complexity. The best example of this form is B&amp;R#2/Oxford/Monticello; another
    good example is Patria. <BR> <BR>That said, there might very well be other structures
    that nobody&#39;s even thought of yet &#40;or at least that haven&#39;t been promulgated

  body: I agree with Hrant that the binocular g is the most out-of-place character
    in the alphabet, but I don&#39;t buy the binocular g with open loop being necessarily
    better.  <BR> <BR>Among classic faces, Baskerville has it, but the loop is nearly
    closed. The slightly open loop - as in your face above also - I think is fine,
    but I find when faces try to open it more, it most often looks awkward. For example,
    the open binocular g I think mars Meta, which is otherwise great. I notice that
    in Unit, Spiekerman has the closed loop. <BR> <BR>I also do agree with Hrant that
    it is a letter where there is scope for new ideas. I just don&#39;t usually find
    the binocular loop opened a lot works well. The monocular g you have been experimenting
    with here is very interesting, for example, though I think it is not fully solved
    yet.   <BR> <BR>By the way, Kabel is one of the few that has a really different

  body: '&#62;sounds like a lot to start with <BR> <BR>At the &#39;Making Faces&#39;
    seminar a few weeks ago in New York, when someone asked about the proliferation
    of styles and weights in type face families, David Berlow of the Font Bureau said
    &#34;You know, we didn&#39;t start this.&#34; In other words, the demand came
    from clients.  <BR> <BR>I really think that having a variety of weights and styles,
    as well as optical variations, as Adobe has done, gives a face an edge over others
    for designers, as it becomes so adaptable to different challenges. So I think
    the variety you talk about is a good idea. <BR> <BR>Also by all means complete
    and include your display version, which you have already. Having this for subtitles
    to titles and even &#39;poster&#39; is great, and gives you an edge, particularly
    because the display is so good.  <BR> <BR>As to what to do first, and how to market
    it, I think this is something that a font publisher can tell you best, because
    they know the market. Maybe the best thing is to approach them with what you&#39;ve
    got, and see what they suggest. <BR> <BR>I agree with Aaron about the top of the
    g being slightly too heavy, but not about the k. When I printed it out &#40;1200
    dpi laser printer&#41;, the gap actually closed in the text size, and in any case
    it harmonizes with your other opened letters, bpq.'

    redesigned, some ampersands added, and the small caps fixed. This version is for
    text/reading, 12pt and below. All of the weirdness that used to be in it has been

    <BR>this may just be kerning issues, but look for the word &#34;unserviceable&#34;.
    It seems to have some difficulties towards the end of the word, specifically between
    the a and b, especially after the &#34;cea&#34; combo. <BR> <BR>The sticky-outy-bit
    &#40;enlight me, please!&#41; of your lc r seems a bit dark. perhaps changing
    the angle at the top-right of the sten may fix that... <BR> <BR>Well, there are
    my two cents. They might be those old ones you can&#39;t use anymore, or be like
    1 yens which aren&#39;t really worth anything. Yeah. <BR> <BR>anywya, looking
    good bro. There is an ocean or jungle or top desk drawer or something of detail

    on my laser printer. Probably you ought to get a printer to do an offset version
    to see it under the real conditions, and make your decisions accordingly.

  body: "\"The monocular form is too modular with respect to the rest of the alphabet.
    It is very legible, but does not contribute much divergence to boumas. The conventional,
    closed binocular form is richly divergent, but it's way too complex - it violates
    the \"rules of belonging\" of the Latin alpahabet too strongly\"\r\n\r\n:) that's
    one way of putting it. And another is that the older form has a unique x-height
    area and a unique descender form and this \"divergence\" breeds readability...\"violates
    the \"rules of belonging\"...not."

  body: "People can get used to anything. But that doesn't mean it doesn't affect
    them. I'm used to the traditional closed-bottom binocular \"g\" myself, and didn't
    realize there was anything wrong with it until I started seriously thinking about
    the Latin alphabet. But just look at it. It's almost an oriental logograph. Formally,
    I would point out that its topology is way more complex than any other lc letter;
    and in the entire alphanumerics only the \"B\" matches it, and at least the \"B\"
    has the two counters abutting - the \"g\" has a link on top of everything. Anecdotally,
    I would point out that this \"unnatural\" complexity is what makes it so hard
    to draw well, with many competent designers failing when they come to it (eg Matrix).
    It's especially hard to get a double-\"g\" not to form too strong a pattern that
    ruins the texture (affecting immersive reading). So it's not a legibility issue
    (almost anything is legible) it's an issue of standing out too much, and by itself.
    Don't get me wrong, I think complexity is da bomb - but it has to be balanced
    - and I feel that the open-bottom binocular form is the ideal (general) balance.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
