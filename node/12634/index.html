<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>¡Howdy!
I was wondering if there are any fonts that scream "American" when you look at em. Fonts designed by Americans, used more by Americans - etc.
A few thoughts I had:
Obviously all the old west looking fonts like <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/wanted/> Wanted </a> look American.
Some others that have been kicking around for many decades like <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/copperplate-gothic/>Copperplate </a> and <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cooper-black/> Cooper Black </a> came to mind.
And maybe P22's <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/hopper-edward/>Hopper, Edward </a>, since it's based on the handwriting of a big time American artist.
I curious to know what you all think,
Cheers! </div>

or others by morris fuller benton (who designed cheltenham)
seeing as how america's a diverse country with a diverse history, it kinda depends on what you define "american" to be...</div>

My votes would be
1. Bud's original Courier for IBM - the official face of officialdom. Don't forget to black out parts of the doc for the authentic declassified security memo look, if that's what you're after.
2. Helvetica, the corporate face of the IRS and all those tax forms.
3. Franklin Gothic

<div class=commentbody>The problem with the "most often used" angle is that these fonts were mostly not American designs. Times Roman is perhaps the most often used text face. For some reason, Century strikes me as having an American look. Helvetica has more of a Swiss connotation to me. Too often, the most popular fonts are those that come bundled free with either Windows, Office, Mac OS, or Adobe applications.
I guess in this Digital type Internet era, nationalistic fonts are melting into multinational fonts. It is so easy to get fonts from anywhere in the world that being pinned to one country's fonts is unrealistic. I have many hundreds of fonts and have never chosen which to purchase because of its nation of origin. I just by the fonts that work best for me. The only reason I might not buy a font from a country is if I never have a need to set that language (meaning I don't understand it). I am very tempted to by one of the Korean fonts because I am intrigued by the letterforms. I would have no practical use for it other than just appreciating the form.

<div class=commentbody>Being an American studying type design in Europe, it's become a surprisingly often occurance for someone to tell me that I'm designing very "American" type. When I ask the person to elaborate it always seems to come down to "adding something a old into something new." Another explanation went along the lines of "in America you don't have anything old so you feel like you have to make something look older." I think that's true with a lot of things, especially architecture, but what do you think about it in regard to type?
I also agree with ericgio about the Goudy reference, I think Goudyness is what a lot of people would consider to be Americanness in type.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Someone (was it Allan Haley?) at Typecon (Minn.?) contrasted US vs European advertising typography letter spacing - as I recall he said the US was a lot tighter. Perhaps setting any American type tighter gets a more American feel.

<div class=commentbody>The funny thing is that Americans (except for the Native American Indian) are from other countries. We are like conglomerate rock, bits of lots of other things melted together into an undefinable amalgam. I am second generation Greek American. My wife is a combination of Ukrainian, Romanian, Russian, and German. My kids are then a fusion of all of this--notice no English speaking ancestors in the mix. Both my wife and my families emigrated to the USA after 1918 so we are not DAR or Mayflower candidates. All this said, my children are no more American than my Russian, El Salvadoran, or Pakistani 1st generation neighbors living on my street. We can try to picture an "American" typeface but whose America? A descendant of the Mayflower or my Salvadoran neighbor?
Perhaps this is like naive Americans who have never been to the Netherlands and picture the Dutch as all wearing wooden shoes. Perhaps there may be some equally naive Europeans who think we in America all wear cowboy hats and carry guns?
The World has truly shrunk. Many of the nationalistic boundaries that we have been so fond to depend on are just naive visions of a bygone era.

<div class=commentbody>I think part of the difficulty is that it's hard to put a blanket stereotype on america because of its all the different ideas and influences it has absorbed. i've read a thread or two about typically dutch typography and type design. Is there less diversity of style in dutch design which therefore makes it easier to label? this isn't meant as a disparaging remark in any way, just observational
for example it’s easy to say Helvetica and Univers embody swiss typography because they were designed by swiss designers and predominantly used in modernist design which became widely known as the swiss school. I'm sure there were some other styles in switzerland, but let's be honest, that was the predominant style and the one for which switzerland is best known.
paul rand was a huge proponent of many of those same ideals and he is the father of graphic design in america. but I don't think that connection makes those swiss typefaces “american” in any way.
so maybe there are american ideals that are embodied in certain typefaces?
I agree with chris about century schoolbook. I always picture kids in a one room schoolhouse on the frontier somewhere.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"for example it’s easy to say Helvetica and Univers embody swiss typography because they were designed by swiss designers and predominantly used in modernist design which became widely known as the swiss school."
I thought Adrian Frutiger was French? Anywho, this is an interesting discussion and one thing that a few others have commented on already is that its really hard to determine the quintessential American face primarily because America is so different in many ways. I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio and live in New York City and let me tell you they're almost completely different countries. New York has more in common with London and Paris than it does with Ohio (aside from language of course). If I were in Cincinnati I would answer Rotis (since there are far fewer designers there and much work is done by only a few firms), but here in New York there are so many different designers and design firms that there doesn't seem to be just one answer.
On the other hand, I'm surprised no one has really mentioned any Benguiat fonts (aside from Bookman). His stuff is very historically American. Nothing screams American like some good ol' photo-lettering style type.

<div class=commentbody>Or, alternately, flip through either of [[Doyald Young]]'s logo design bibles [[Logotypes and Letterforms]] or [[Fonts and Logos]]. His designs are rife with Morris Fuller Benton type, and even when the faces he uses aren't American, he uses them in a very American way.
I'm kind of surprised that nobody's mentioned any of the five billion woodtype faces out there, but then again, I doubt many of y'all went to school out Montana way like I did. Nothing says ol' time Americana like some stylized woodtype on a tall skinny poster.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Franklin Gothic by Morris Fuller Benton, most any Goudy font but especially Goudy Modern, Goudy Extra Bold, and Goudy Old Style, always loved Goudy Thirty in metal, definitely Dwiggins Electra, any style Cooper especially Cooper 570, love Centaur by Bruce Rogers. I guess I am thinking more about metal type as the kind of American type I am used to. There aren't quite "five billion woodtype faces out there" but there are enough to keep me happy doing what I do.

<div class=commentbody>To answer Joe's question, I was mostly thinking of a font that says "American" like baseball and apple π (to be honest - from the anglo-saxon perspective).
I can certainly see Cheltenham, Goudy, and Century Schoolbook as all american. And Stephen, I see what you mean by Clarendon. What about ITC Bookman? It kinda has that feel taken even further.

<div class=commentbody>Upon reading the initial question, Morris Fuller Benton's Franklin Gothic family immediately jumped to the front of my mind. While I agree that Century Schoolbook and numerous classic woodtype faces have a quintessential Americana flavor to them, among others, I think one would be hard-pressed to find a typeface that has had such consistant and widespread usage since its creation than Franklin Gothic. Perhaps it's just my newspaper background shining through, but I think the typeface has an elegant simplicity to it, with a touch of flavor, as well. Its heavy variety, for example, has a way of being firm without the artlessness of Impact or any number of unfortunate slab serifs. Franklin Gothic is undoubtably "new" -- at least as of the machine age -- and I think its lack of pretense speaks to what I like to think of as one of the best aspects of the American character, assuming there is such a thing. In other words, I don't think the typeface is trying to pass itself off as something it's not. It's just a great, utilitarian sans serif family, and I feel its widespread popularity since its creation near the turn of the century (just as the US was beginning to assert itself as an international power) makes a compelling argument for it as the "most American" typeface.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have the feeling that the classic American faces have a little more virtuoso "drawing" in them than comparable European faces. This would certainly be true of Goudy's faces, and you still see it in Berlow, Hoefler (especially his serifed), and of course Robert Slimbach.
An appreciation for the beauty of line for its own sake, rather than as mere servant to the overbearing rigor of a design system. At the risk of generalizing, there is something of use to commercial showmanship in this, and American culture is very commercial.
Having said that, in the digital revolution (despite the contributions of LettError and FontShop, a largely American-driven phenomenon), there has been a strain of hardcore experimentalism, where American typographers and type designers have been every bit as theoretical as the Europeans, and not afraid to produce conceptually driven work quite harsh in appearance. Many of Licko's designs, such as Matrix and Base, have this quality.
So these two leading proponents, Slimbach and Licko, could be said to represent the dichotomy of American culture, the mainstream (corporate) and the anti-establishment.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Grunge fonts that sprung from David Carson's aesthetic seem contemporary American to me. Not sure if that's accurate to their origins/influences, but they seem skater/surfer influenced. Also, Ed Fella's vernacular work. I agree with tbiddy about the photo-lettering.
Revivals like Mrs. Eaves and Filosofia (in their method of revival, rather than the type itself). Many of Emigre's fonts, in many ways, actually.
Though, as others mentioned, Century Schoolbook and Clarendon feel American to me. Oh, and boxing poster types in the vein of Knockout and Balboa.
Wow, names keep hitting the front of my brain now. Maybe I agree with Nathan most of all: "All of these at once."</div>

<div class=commentbody>Centered Clarenden caps as display and justified Century Expanded as text was, for me, the “American Look” in the 50s. Later (early 60s) Cooper Black was all the rage. The 60s also brought the International style to the U.S. with AG, then Univers and Helvetica. Since then we have gone through many font flirtations. I don’t think I can come up with a single face that would mean “American” over all time. Maybe that is the point. America is always in a visual state of flux. We either borrow form from others or quickly invent our own and just as quickly abandon it in favor of some newer fad.

<div class=commentbody>Everyone seems to be treating "American" like some monolithic thing that a single typeface can somehow express. The first Declaration of Independence was printed in Caslon. Which isn't much like 19th-century slave lettering or contemporary urban graffiti. America is factionalized and always has been. Before you can pick a typeface to represent it you have to specify which America you're talking about. There's a political element implicit in the question.

<div class=commentbody>I know this might sound ridiculous due to their actual origin, but I always found the Bell types to look tremendously American.
And Christian's Los Feliz is, I think, the most quintessentially American type I've seen - in character, at least, if not often in use.
I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the early Cherokee types as being American. Or perhaps "those Americans" don't count.

<div class=commentbody>The Cherokee types (there are a few) are based on the <a href=http://www.cherokee.org/Extras/Downloads/Font/Keyboard.htm>85-character syllabary</a> and I have only, unfortunately, seen them typeset in specimens and not actual "real world" usage (although I know the historians among you will argue that specimens are just as much an authentic - or even more authentic - use as any other). It's similar to the LDS Deseret type in that it's based on a roman alphabet.

Geez, I really hate to be so politically incorrect here but you do realize where the word America comes from, hopefully? The European occupation doesn't provide aboriginal claims to Americanism. What the hell does prior soil got to do with it? Who was here before the northern transmigration? There is some evidence that other humans "existed" here prior to the occupation by what you refer to as "those Americans," and who were exterminated as a consequence. And, I should point out, in the typographical vein, the original point of this post would seem to be what is American as thought of in the here and now. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Interesting thread. National traits are always a bit elusive and with exceptions. Still, they are also, depending on the area of interest, palpable. Confucious said something like: show me the music and dance of a country, and I will tell you its character.
Nick's second post in this thread I think captured something in speaking of more showy or expressive line to attract attention.
And Vince Connaire's quote and comment is also on target in that Americans want warmth in the designs. That's why to me Goudy is always the quintessential American type designer, even though Benton and Dwiggins are in some aspects better.
Overall, I think there is more of a desire to make typefaces friendly - a general American trait - than in the more formal European ones.
This kind of difference doesn't show up just in America vs Europe. I saw an exhibition of the first European porcelain vases and the Chinese vases they were imitating. It was really striking how much more intimate the European designs were compared to the Chinese ones, which had a stiff, formal, Imperial perfection to them.
>Stop waving your flag, America.
Oh, give it a rest, Nick. This is not about better or worse, just different. You do have a point, though, in that that type design is, and has always been more international than many other arts.

<div class=commentbody>Just two years spent in the US. But to me the essence of America is Franklin Gothic and Bell Gothic. Okay from URW suits this couple perfectly. I can already see the fantastic design of constructors company logo using these faces on glossy Mack truck cabin side door. Conservative and naive but strong and straight.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well I am American too, altough I have never stepped in the US...
I would say that all upper case sans serif grotesques -specially wide or condensed- are the most characteristic sign of the United States typography, but I dislike it. I'm sorry but sometimes I can´t stand the uglyness of this style which seems to appear everywere: from electoral signs to signage to magazine advertising to business facades.
On the other hand I like very much the warmth of Californian FB but I really don´t associate it with the United States, altough I do associate some of the Goudy's flourishes with it.

<div class=commentbody>What an interesting thread! Wasn't it on this site that someone referred to Franklin Gothic as the American Helvetica?
I recently made an exhibition about the 1923 Type Specimen Book & Catalogue from the American Type Founders (ATF). In the accompanying blurb I called it a ‘sleeping giant’ of early 20th century typography, and went on to say "Looking at what informs the design of these letters and pages, one can almost sense the American love affair with wide open spaces. The types (Bookman, Century, Cheltenham, Goudy, Souvenir) that perhaps best constitute ‘the ATF style’ are designed to be set wide; they have broad, bracketed serifs and generous proportions."
Incidentally the show also included specimen settings of Pabst.
This of course, is not meant to be definitive; so much has changed since 1923. But some of the more recent types and what people are saying about them here, reflect those changes pretty well. No one typeface will ever define a nation, but I think it's possible to agree that some of (20th C) Americas greatest type designers had a stylistic commonality; Dwiggins, Goudy, TM Cleland and the Bentons all deserve to be mentioned in the same company here.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Joshua, while the typical Cherokee types show influences of Latin letterforms, it is important to note that Sequoya's original syllabics looked quite different from the types that were made (by non-Cherokees). His original design for the writing system was much more cursive and less Latinate.
All you Mac OS X users have a Cherokee font on your systems: <a href=http://www.tiro.com/Plantagenet/plantagenet_index3.html>Plantagenet Cherokee</a> designed by Ross Mills. Plantagenet references both Sequoya's original design as well as the typographic tradition, although obviously needing to meet readers' expectations. Most Cherokee types are degraded copies of a single early model, and Plantagenet, to my knowledge, is the first design to re-evaluate the typographic history of this script.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The Western movie and TV series are both past their heyday, but nonetheless still provide the dominant image of an American typographic past, the archetype. It is somewhat illusory, because although the myth of the Wild West is uniquely American, the lettering styles aren't.
Typography (lettering, really) is front and centre as the protagonist rides into town, past the magnificently signified Bank, Saloon, Hotel, and General Store, before reaching the Sheriff's Office and the Wanted poster. This may be why 19th-century display types, or reworkings such as Clarendon or Americana, have the national resonance they do. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I think "what is the quitessential American typeface?" is an interesting question but alas it is probably going to sit for eternity without an answer that even a 25% minority says "ahh, yes, that is it."
The reasons for this are deep, I think. First of all, the typographic cross pollination between Europe and American has been intense since, oh about 1850. So there are a lot of types on both sides of the pond that've been deeply effected from the other side, e.g. Chelt and Times. Also: Americans commission many more fonts than anyone else, and have for decades, they'll buy and use types in ways that'd make other nationals cringe (see or hear Spiekermann), and thus, find new design styles through heavy use, misuse and other routes to discovery (see grunge)...whichis why we're "here" and they are all still "there".)
This's been aided and abbetted by American type companies, from the first Cambridge foundry to Linotype, ATF, ITC, then Adobe and into the modern-est era of HTF, FB and P22, US makers are and have historically been among the most active in the world. As users, our Gringos have short fashion cycles, big wallets and questionable tastes, so all these companies find clients galore.
One whole branch the always leaps out at me as "American" is typewriter faces. This example bundles a lot of what I've said above into a, perhaps, clear example. Before ITC Typewriter, no one thought of it; I mean we were just escaping the real typewriter and who'd be dumm enough to release a thing so odd as a "designerly" typeface based on such a hideous machine? The rest is history with the amazing popularity of that series.
And then something happened that no one could have predicted and was totally American: (kind of like Bilbo finding the ring), computers needed monospaced fonts so software developers would only have to count characters, and since they all had the same width, you could write code that laid them out even if you were an idiot ( :o ). You could also read your code more easily if it was "all lined up" nice and neat, (I guess). So a new life sprung up for typewriter faces and again, the rest is history, though unfortunately, Courier is everywhere.
Looping back to the point, type is so American that you can argue forever about Dwiggins, Benton, Stone, Frere-Jones, Chank!, without really getting a hold on the tail of the issue, which is that we're probably a sick society, but new type makes us feel much better, and that is really American.

So do I but I always thought they (Dom Casual & Murray Hill, etc.) cast a bad light on American type design. I hope this is not what we are remembered for. (I guess it is our sad legacy though, just as much as slavery, Viet Nam, and Iraq.)

<div class=commentbody>Maxim,
I don't know why those faces are so unappealing to me. When I was a young designer in the early 1960s, I had a complete stack of large specimen cards from ATF. Among them were Dom Casual and Murray Hill. I had seen the types used (perhaps overused) many times but seeing them there on those yellow ochre cards along with many other much better types really gave me a negative reaction. It is funny that a typeface can do that to a person. I can't explain it. Perhaps it was that they were wannabe showcard brush lettering and therefore don't seem honest to me. The contradiction is that several years later, upon seeing Herculanum, I fell in love with its forms even though they should have been subject to the same dishonest feelings I had for Dom Casual. For some reason, I perceived a difference--and still do. I suppose type can really generate a visceral reaction one way or the other. I quite like the look of Fractur for its own form and can easily dismiss the perceived association with Nazi history some people profess. For some reason though, I can't shake my early distaste for Dom and Murray.

Some of us American designers much prefer Univers to Helvetica. The type studio in the design school I attended (Carnegie Mellon University) had numerous complete hot metal sets of all the Univers weights. We had no Helvetica but some display sizes of AG. Other than Jack Stauffacher (there was lots of wood type), most typography professors were from either Basel or Ulm.
I firmly believe that the popularity of Helvetica and Arial in the U.S. was do to their being bundled with software or laser printers.

This is perhaps a function of the Desktop Publishing craze of a few years back fueled by the current tricks packed into MS Word. I guess people feel compelled to use ALL the tricks just because they are there (no matter how garish). The only tricks they surely will never use is buying an actual font. It seems "free" is the American trendsetter in amateur typography. Some of us still love those flat, boring letters though :-)

<div class=commentbody>> <em>something as innocent as a font design</em>
I agree: there are no national implications inherent to a type face. What we <em>are</em> discussing in this thread is common connotations, norms, stereotypes and perceptive customs that we tend to attach to type faces in discourse and while using type in praxis.
There are different approaches to lettering and design, though. These are more likely a result of traditions, "schools", and common conventions than nationality (although national -- and lingual -- borders are also borders for traditions, "schools" and conventions in typography).
Conclusion: When talking about the relative 'Americanness' (or 'europeanness' or 'greekness' and so forth) of type design, do not forget that this quality is always a second order quality.
This is not about being politically correct but about trying to understand how 'type nationality' works and how we can handle the original question. That question already had part of my suggested clarification in it: <em>fonts that <strong>scream</strong> “American”</em> -- the type face is expected to 'scream', i.e. take part in discourse itself and take a position there.

<div class=commentbody>The discussion of a “national” feel a font may have is intriguing. No one seems to have mentioned Gill Sans as the quintessential font of modern Great Britain. Also, isn't Americana an obvious choice for an American font? How about Mistral for 1960s-era France? Or Caxton for Mexico (maybe that’s a stretch).</div>

Font that screams American to me - Comic Sans!
Hate the font, but somehow seems typically american to me, Semi casual, found just about everywhere, overhyped, and either loved or hated by all. Even those who profess hatred of the font have most probably used it at some time, for some project.

Ok, bring them on! ;)
I am quite sure, though, that all your counter arguments will have something to do with context (institutional, biographical, connotational, historical, conventional, etc.), not with <em>inherent</em> features of a type face. </div>

<div class=commentbody>generally, i get more of an American vibe out of western fonts on "Most Wanted" posters than i do from fonts by Benton or Goudy. they may have made fonts with a decidedly American style, but their fonts are universally pliable. i can use Franklin Gothic in Europe without the design looking "American" in any way.. it's much harder to look at/use a western-style font without thinking of the wild west in America.
did anyone mention H&FJ's <a href=http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html>Gotham</a>? it strikes me as very American (which it's history can attest to).

<div class=commentbody>I think what Americans think of as American type is more broad than what might be thought accross the oceans. Perhaps too much of what has been seen on foreign shores comes out of Hollywood--and that means a lot of weterns? Gotham, to me is a very American face and in much more versatile than western faces (and quite good as well!).

This apple is sweet, hence the apple has to be perceived as tasting sweet.
Gotham's 'a' is double storey and has no serifs, hence what?

The caucasus range is in one place. American genes come from all over the planet, and American geography varies hugely. Chauvinist philosophy could perhaps be used to contrast the cultural styles of discrete, isolated populations, but it doesn't work for a continental melting pot. However, lifestyle and diet (nurture, rather than nature) do have physical, national implications, but I'm not sure if that can be related to typestyle. But if it can, then Diner surely has his finger on the pulse!</div>

No, but it can allude to things that are inherent to physical
features of Europe[ans] (not that defining Europe[an] is easy).
Nobody is isolated. Nonetheless, the melting pot is in your head(s).
Every location on this earth is different, although mostly it's so
subtle as to escape our conscious (but not subconscious) views.
Subtle as in text font, not faddish display font...
Don't fear our human reality because it makes you have to work/think harder.

<div class=commentbody></em>I did not deny context and the possibility for any thing to allude to something else. The intent was to differenciate between existing things and features we (thus perfectly fitting into cultural etc. norms, i.e. 'our human reality') ascribe to them. Just yesterday, as I sat scrubbing my skin because of my (well-deserved!) sunburn, I was really annoyed about this terrible European sun…
The question 'I want to have a perfectly American typeface' may just be impossible to answer, whereas 'I want to have a typeface that will be recognised as having American features because of its origin, its history, its predecessors, or just because it was designed to fit into what may at a certain time be experienced or visually perceived as "being American"' can match a certain subset of the currently available type faces and styles.
But this may be a long question to ask, I admit.
So I guess Mr. Shinn and V/W make it to the next round ;) </div>
