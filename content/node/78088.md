body: "Slash as a diacritic is almost only known to produce \xD8\xF8. For these glyphs,
  there are specific design recommendations (slash would be centered and its extremes
  would match or be near the O extremes). Here are the \xD8\xF8 from the font I'm
  preparing:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slash01_3567.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Slashed
  Oo.</em>\r\n\r\nAlthough much less common, there are other characters with the diacritic
  slash, as A, C, E and T. But in all fonts I verify, slash applied to these letters
  is clearly different than the \xD8\xF8. It is usually steeper and goes well beyond
  baseline/caps height.\r\n\r\nYou can find a list of fonts with these characters
  here: [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23a/fontsupport.htm|A]], [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23B/fontsupport.htm|C]],
  [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/246/fontsupport.htm|E]], and [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23E/fontsupport.htm|T]].\r\n\r\nMaybe
  this is due to the angle of \xD8\xF8 slash, which produces bad results for AaEeTt,
  whose widths are smaller than Oo. It also cannot be centered exactly without causing
  some undesired overlaps.\r\n\r\nI made some tests and decided to also use a different
  slash for these letters, as found in other fonts. But I'm quite unsure if this is
  the better solution:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slash02_5237.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Slashed
  letters.</em>\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion?"

  body: Beautiful idea, Frode! Simple and very wise. I saw the optical illusion but
    was not able to formulate any solution. Thanks a lot.

  body: "To me, the most glaring difference is that \xD8 and \xF8 appear to be actual
    letters, where constant use developed proper design guidelines. While the others
    appear to be just constructions, where the juxtaposition of a slash bears no connection
    either with handwriting nor with the shape of the letter. This is most evident
    on A-slash.\r\nThat\u2019s not a problem with your solution (which works) but
    with the glyphs themselves.\r\nOut of curiosity, how different is your \xA2 from
    c-slash?"

  body: "Agreed. \xD8\xF8 have unit, the others not. I especially dislike slashed
    A (and with the same slash from \xD8 it becomes much worse) but do not see a better
    way to design this.\r\n\r\nHere are my cents:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cent_4577.gif]"

  body: "The only improvement that I can see could improve the A would be either intersect
    the slash at the left foot or going unconventional and make it parallel to the
    left stem.\r\nEither way, you\u2019ll loose the balance on the other glyphs.\r\n\r\nInteresting
    that your \xA2 terminals are different from those of c."

  body: "<cite>your \xA2 terminals are different from those of c.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's
    based on petite cap C. I made monetary symbols using small caps or petite caps,
    except dong, livre-tournois, cent and mill. But there are corrections to do here:
    Euro terminals need to be stronger and dong is still a bit heavy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cur_4190.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Currency
    symbols.</em>\r\n\r\nAgain, I agree with you: a parallel bar (to left side of
    A) surely produces the best result. There is a font using this, Linux Libertine
    I guess. But unhappily these characters are used in the same languages and the
    conflict between slopes become very ugly.\r\n\r\nHere is another try for slashed
    A, C, E and T. Closed counterspace is still problematic in A. But if bar is moved
    to the right, the left base appear very thick. So only acceptable possibilities
    are to coincide with left base or to stand far from it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slashes_6400.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Slashed

  body: "I think it's fair to give a feedback about how the issue was concluded. I
    decided to adopt the same slash from \xD8, with small adjusts. For example: slash
    for E is thinner than for C due to optical illusion.\r\n\r\nLowercase also follows
    this criteria. For t, I extended the bar a bit to the right, so it glues to slash.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slashes_6366.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>
    Slashed uppercase and lowercase sets.</em>\r\n\r\nI must thanks Frode Frank once
    more. His tip is really useful and I'm using it in many situations aside \xD8\xF8.
    This gives an idea about how I used it to correct optical illusions:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/optical_5506.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Optical
    correction for slash and stroke.</em>"

  body: I'm glad it was useful, Igor. It'd be interesting to try my hands at these.
    I'm thinking a slash with a similar angle to the left leg on A might solve some
    problems.
