  difference between contextual and stylistic alternates? I am in my sixth or seven
  month of this really stressful learning curve towards the making of open type fonts.
  I know I haven''t shared my ideas in the "Critique" side of here but first I want
  to make sure I got everything right on the BUILD side, so please, if you could share
  this basic info with a poor type wannabe, I''d be grateful forever. Hi from Mexico,
  Seneca'

  body: Contextual alternates take into account the characters on either side of the
    character in question. They are useful, for example, in connected scripts where
    certain letter combinations require different forms to make a smooth connection.

  body: 'Also: contextual alternates (meaning the ''calt'' feature) are intended to
    be "on by default". Applications which recognize this feature are expected to
    have it enabled by default. Stylistic alternates (the ''salt'' feature, or stylistic
    sets, ''ss##'') are expected to be discretionary, or off by default.'
