body: "I am having an issue with FontExplorer and have been looking around to see
  if anyone else has run into this problem.\r\n\r\nWe just finished converting all
  of the fonts \u2013 4500 of them \u2013 from PostScript and TrueType to OpenType.
  I know this is not ideal, but we are beginning to purchase Vista machines and they
  no longer support PS fonts without the outlines file. At the same time we are moving
  to using LinoType FontExplorer.\r\n\r\nThe problem that I am running into happens
  while trying to activate some specific font families, but have been unable to narrow
  it down. Take for example Helvetica Neue, when I try to activate the family I get
  the following error:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/conflict_3524.png]\r\n\r\nWhen
  I compare the internal naming of these fonts I cannot find any of the naming that
  overlaps and would create an issue.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this issue and how
  have you gotten around it?\r\nDoes anyone think that it may be linked to the font
  conversion?\r\nAlso, of note we are unfortunately on PC? Is this a PC issue?\r\n\r\nAny
  help, or suggestions would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    even allow this in their license agreement. \r\n\r\nSecondly, any PostScript fonts
    without the outline file would be useless, no?"
