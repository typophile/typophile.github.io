body: "Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\nJust finished my first concept for this company and wanted
  to get some feedback while I work on some other ideas.\r\n\r\nThis first concept
  came about as the client wants to work with the letter \"A\"\u2014playing off of
  \"Alsip\" and also the layout of their lot is \"a-shaped\".\r\n\r\nAfter a little
  doodling I noticed that a rotated box, inside an non-rotated box create A's. So
  you have a box within a box to show the storage aspect, and it also makes four A's
  that can be seen when the logo is rotated 0, 90, 180, and 360 degrees.\r\n\r\nI
  didn't bother putting time into kerning yet, so let me slide on that for now.\r\n\r\nLet
  me know what you think so far.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alsip_self_storage_logo_1_5085.gif]\r\n\r\n"

    box in a box idea. \r\n\r\nGood work.\r\n\r\npenn"

    think about storage I think about security & strong. The logo looks too flimsy
    to me.\r\n\r\nThe second logo is a better suite imo. I would change the green
    boxes to brown since most moving boxes are brown color."

    the second one hits the target audience better. Maybe to make it less 'windowy'
    what if you removed one of the 'boxes'?\r\n\r\n"

    makes the inner square ? is my english understandable?

    could be used in some combination of negative space in the counters (clearly not
    like i've done), or next to the A where you have had a large square--something--but
    i find the idea of 3 stacked boxes compelling in terms of the formal similarity
    between the shape of the A and the boxes. plus, as aluminum pointed out, stacked
    boxes really does imply boxes."

    <em>\"This is one of the two water towers which are notable landmarks with their
    dark red color and fluted shaft. Both are visible to travelers on I-294.\"</em>\r\n\r\nMike,
    have you considered changing the rectangle shapes (red & blue) from your latest
    post (20.Jul.2009 6.27pm) and changing them to mimic the \"famous\" water tower?
    A dome on top with the skewed rectangle below? Just a thought. \r\n\r\nI agree
    that the middle one in the second image is well balanced and looks good ... but
    wow, is it boring! Totally unmemorable. Sorry, but that's my impression. I love
    simplicity, but this feels like it needs something to punch it up; a subtle pattern,
    a fine paper texture, letterpress printing, anything to make it look thought-out.
    I like the top (red/blue) one much better. "
