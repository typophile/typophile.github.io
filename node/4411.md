  boss is crazy. I know that for Adobe specifically you can transfer the license,
  but not sure if you can transfer the platform. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Does anyone know if it is possible to transfer
  licenses for software from MAC to PC? I&#39;m specifically curious about Adobe,
  but anything would be interesting. Media 100 too.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> We figured as much. Turns out they will work with us.
    It is just a matter of some paper work. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Adobe has some of the most understanding and workable
    licenses around.
