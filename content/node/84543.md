  used in it is Willow.  I'm working on his website and need a pairing font for the
  copy/navigation.  He showed me what the designer of the mark paired with it on the
  back of his business and appointment cards (it's Helvetica - badly kerned). run
  through a couple of selections and he hasn't liked a single one of them. \r\n\r\nI've
  attached a partial image contact sheet for the website, (degraded for file size)
  and a .jpg of Willow - Any thoughts?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wts_image_contact_4159.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/willow_5014.jpg]"
