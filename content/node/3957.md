  <BR>Could you possibly critique this? I didnt create the font, but was wondering
  what the experts thought of it?

    Why not try and leave the &#39;a&#39; as seperate and cut the &#39;m&#39;? &#40;so
    the leftmost stem seems to come from the &#39;a&#39;. draw a thick white stroke

    <BR>I think the break increases readability. You can also use 2 colours to seperate
    the words even more if you want. <BR>That Cap height is huge. Try reducing it
    some? might give a better flow. <BR> <BR>Bren '

    I am also going to have to say nix on the binoc &#34;a&#34; as i tried and it

    really looking at some of the characters - I wonder if the &#34;u&#34;, the &#34;r&#34;
    and the &#34;e&#34; need just a bit of work on some of the curves. I&#39;m noticing
    a bit of straightness or something - can&#39;t find the technical word for it
    but see the lower left inside of the &#34;e&#34;. <BR> <BR>Also - I prefer the
    word &#34;dura&#34; to be full strength over the other word - since it is your

    ALT=":&#41;"> This was mostly for concept anyways <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> The gradient probably shouldnt have been in this picture, as I really
    wasnt considering it, and was just too lazy to take it out. Thanks for the comments!
    Anyone else have anything else? I should be able to post something new pretty
    soon. '

  body: ' Like Ben said, &#39;dura&#39; should be full strength. I think that because
    the face is so geometric you will not be able to manipulate the logo much more.  <BR>One
    thing you might consider is the 10% grey outline, either darken it or take it
    out. Light greys like that often dont copy well. <BR> <BR>To give the logo more
    substance you might try a bolder weight? that way at a smaller size it will read
    well. Have you also tried inverting the colour? &#40;white on black&#41; I often
    find it helpful to test for eventualities. <BR> <BR>That &#39;e&#39; does need
    a redraw ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Bren '

    In a negative space kind of way. But, shouldn&#39;t you include the entire curve
    of the m? The entire &#39;d&#39; is better. The bottom one reminds me of Depeche
    Mode. '
