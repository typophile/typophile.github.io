  (Year two), AUT University, Auckland, NZ.\r\n\r\nI have an indentity assignment,
  \"Atlantis\" - Aquarium.\r\n\r\nCurrently its set in Baskerville.\r\nI have Mrs
  Eaves, and was hoping for some possible ligature combinations, there are none.\r\nI
  no this probably means that there is no need, But damn, Mrs eaves ligatures are
  beautiful! \r\n\r\nWhat are some possible combinations that you can think of? be
  they decorative or functional?"

    The good part about it is there are no wrong answers, as long as they make sense.
    Check out this simple ligature: http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/love_at_first_glancia.php\r\n\r\nIt
    is beautiful and subtle. I think you could go with either extreme ligatures or
    subtle but I see combinations between the A+t, t+l, a+n, t+i, and the i+s. So,
    almost every letter could have a ligature. Don't go overboard, no pun intended,
    but see which combinations work the best in whatever typeface you end up using.
    Baskerville is a nice typeface to experiment in so have fun! "
