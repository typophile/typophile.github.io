    property would be nice too."

  body: "Nice to see the return of the scrollbar. However, now it seems there's a
    display problem on Mozilla-based browsers:\r\nIn the main posts, images appear
    pushed all the way to the right edge of the centre column, covering the rightmost
    one."

  body: "Yeah, I mentioned that to Jared. He needs to put in a {clear: both } declaration.
    Seems like only Mozilla, though. I didn\u2019t see the problem with Safari or
    Opera, anyway."

  body: "I can confirm it displays fine on IE too. \r\nAnd this particular post looks
    ok in Mozilla now. However, this one (http://typophile.com/node/91578), for example,
    still exhibit the odd behaviour.\r\n"

  body: "It only occurs if the image is the first element in the content. So, in this
    particular post, the initial line of text provides an adequate buffer.\r\n\r\nThe
    issue has to do with the way various elements at the head of the post are floated.
    If an image of a certain size occurs directly after the title and posted-by meta
    info, then because of the float, it gets pushed over. \r\n\r\nEither the .content
    or the .imageWrap needs to get cleared. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure why it only
    seems to have started at the same time as the image-scrolling was put back in.
    The two should be separate issues.\r\n\r\nI sent Jared a screenshot a couple days
    ago. I\u2019ll talk to him again about it."
