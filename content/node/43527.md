  body: Rubens is a Dan Solo font from Dover Books (and on CD). OPTI fonts in Chicago
    has a  extra condensed and wide version of the same font - can not tell if Dover
    and Opti versions are the same but they look close in printed samples.

  body: "The original Rubens font was made by me (Facsimile Fonts 1962). Dan Solo
    got the font from me and Optifont copied it. Therefore, the Dover version is authentic.\r\nBob
