  any common typefaces from the 20th century that were used in futuristic works? (1909-1920s).\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I read somewhere that Studley is a font that was used. Does anyone know where I
  can download this, or if it is even available digitally?\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate
  any help you can give me.\r\n\r\n"

    filter out the Art Deco fonts, although I've also seen those used. It's probably
    more about placement, suggesting movement:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marinetti_3967.gif]\r\n\r\n(
    I'll stop doing your homework now ;-) )"

  body: "Thanks for your input, although I suppose I should have mentioned that I've
    already found P22 Il Futurismo, and that I'm looking for more of a body text typeface.\r\n\r\nI'm
    really hoping to find something that somehow is an integral part of the Futurism
    period. (Il Futurismo is of course, but is more of a display type, rather than
    a body text type.)\r\n\r\nAlso, Futura is more of a Bauhaus and Constructivism
    typeface."

  body: "I don't think there really is a typical futurist (body) typeface. From what
    I've seen (so far) they used typefaces that were at hand (like Bauhaus or Art
    Deco or plain) and played with composition.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not an expert on the
    matter. I didn't mean to state things you already know, I was just intriged by
    your question. It's an interesting movement.\r\n\r\nHave you seen this book already?:

    purchase it, I might ;-)"

    my findings I have come to realize this too; that there is no specific font. I
    was hoping someone else could tell me different, but it seems everyone I ask comes
    to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThat book has come up in my searches, but I am
    unable to purchase anything at this time.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your help."
