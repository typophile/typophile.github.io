    Calliope</a> is similar and arguably more readable.

  body: "Hi Stephan,\r\n\r\nThank you for the reply. Actually the typeface is called
    Deloitte Script - part of a brand and unfortunately not available to the public.
    I found out the name through a PDF it was used in.\r\n\r\nYes MVB Calliope is
    very close - might need thinning out a bit and straightened slightly. There is
    also Wiesbaden Swing which is sort of similar.\r\n\r\nThanks again though.\r\nMukhtar"
