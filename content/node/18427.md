  when making composites using the "Generate Glyphs" feature?

  body: "To prevent the accents from shifting up, you can specify \"~\" as in A+~acute\r\n\r\nBut
    to put the component always at 0,0, you need to either use anchors (just set them
    onto the 0,0 position at both glyphs so the components will snap there) or set
    the position of the second component to 0,0 per Python after generating the glyph
    as is: \r\n\r\nfl.glyph.components[1].delta = Point(0,0)\r\nfl.UpdateGlyph(-1)\r\n\r\nA."
