body: "I am in search of an outstanding paper to use in our Canon Color Laser Copier
  1150 (and similar). The \"felt\" like or uncoated papers are what I am looking for
  but I have had poor results with spotting and streaking. So far \"Carnival\" 65lb.
  cover has the texture closest to what I would prefer.\r\n\r\nAnyone know of a paper
  that can handle the laser ink so well it looks almost printed?"

  body: I have done a LOT of printing to the CLC1180 and CLC5000, and have found that
    Hammermill 80# Photo White Cover gives the best results.
