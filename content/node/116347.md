body: "Inspired by a comment by Hrant Papazian that several other scripts have advantages
  over the Latin script in readability, I've come up with an alternative to learning
  a new script in order to obtain the benefits sought.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/semi2_5648.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  started with Linden Hill, compressing the capital letters vertically by 15%, while
  leaving the lower-case letters unchanged.\r\n\r\nI gave the capital letters A, G,
  and L small ascenders, and C, G, P, T, V, W, and Y small descenders, by restoring
  their uncompressed forms, and aligning them suitably. The letter J had a small ascender
  added the same way; so its original large descender remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nExpanding
  the lower-case letters a, v, and w by 25% gave a a small ascender and v and w small
  descenders. m, n, and r were given small descenders by dealing with elements of
  the letters, and u was given a small ascender in the same fashion.\r\n\r\nIn addition,
  the large ascender of d and the large descender of q were diminished in size (but
  not reduced to the size of small ascenders and small descenders) to avoid the mirror-reflection
  issue.\r\n\r\nSo even words in all caps will now be more likely to have a \"bouma\",
  and lower-case words will have more frequent ascenders and descenders, but small
  enough to be not overly disturbing to the Latin alphabet with which everyone is
  comfortable."

    where fast uncontextualized word recognition may be critical\r\n\r\nThis could
    certainly amount to the readability of isolated words but I'm not so sure how
    this would work on a long text. The changes do certainly give the typeface a playful
    character. Do you have samples of long running text set with this?\r\n\r\nA thing
    to consider is that increasing the distinctiveness of characters may ultimately
    hinder readability of longer texts because it's not all about distinction (which
    may lead to distraction) but also about rhythm and unobtrusiveness. While reading
    the mind is predicting and confirming predictions to make sense out of the text:
    context and good writing can help readability more than the best type designer
    could ever do.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Incidentally, after posting this, thinking of the fact that Hrant mentioned
    Arabic and Korean, I thought of another way to add more bouma to the Latin script.
    Have the letters in each syllable on a baseline angled downwards slightly, perhaps
    descending in steps. Or just have the consonants before the vowel raised, those
    after the vowel lowered.\r\n\r\nAlso: the illustration provided is simply a mockup
    of a thought I had, so as to get feedback from Hrant as to whether this kind of
    font would address his concerns or not. It may be that I have misunderstood what
    he finds to be lacking in the Latin script.\r\n\r\nAs well, while it is true that
    the baselines are perhaps less prominent when there are more ascenders and descenders,
    it isn't intended to lead to a ransom note effect. This diagram, incorporating
    some minor corrections as well, shows the lines:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/baselines_5000.jpg]\r\n\r\n1:
    Ascender height\r\n2: Old cap height - cap secondary ascender height\r\n3: New
    normal cap height\r\n4: Lowercase secondary ascender height\r\n5: x-height\r\n6:
    baseline\r\n7: Secondary descender depth (upper and lower case)\r\n8: Reduced
    full descender depth (q)\r\n9: Descender depth\r\n\r\nThe reduced full ascender
    height, as evidenced by the letter d, didn't get a horizontal red line in this
    diagram; it would have been just two pixels above the new normal cap height, (3).\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is a small, not extended, text sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text2_6687.jpg]"

  body: "I think the result is still too jumpy to be usable. Maybe having only a full
    and half descender depths would work better and also choosing only some critical
    characters to alter would ease the jumpiness: one of the r,n,m group, either the
    r or the t, the b or the d and the q or the p.\r\n\r\n I think caps are distinct
    and enough from lower case and infrequent enough to distinguish themlselves. I
    don't think height variations on the upper side of the x line are helping since
    this is area with already more distinctiveness."

    making letters more distinctive is a worthwhile goal and does contribute to legibility.
    But I expect that the differences need to be within the range of normal for those
    letters. Otherwise the reader has to essentially \u201Clearn\u201D your specific
    typeface to become comfortable and speedy reading it. That seems like an awful

    the modified script - these distortions can be applied to most text typefaces
    - the more important letter shapes (which aren't changed much) are, and the less
    important word shapes (which is what this changes) are.\r\n\r\nIn a way, that's
    not a cruel paradox; the less benefit it provides, the less effort it asks. But
    it could mean that if it can be done, it's not worth doing.\r\n\r\nOnly if such
    a script initially impairs readability, by no longer providing the word shapes
    that people have memorized through their reading, would the greater diversity
    of word shapes provide a benefit. I tried to minimize the problem by making the
    new features much smaller than previously existing ascenders and descenders, but
    I suspect that won't be sufficient to reduce the impact, since any contribution
    of word shapes to facile reading would not happen at a conscious level."

    It's pretty straight-forward once you really think about it. Also, it's entirely
    routine for an experimental psychologist to miss the point. One can harbor a bit
    more hope for experienced typophiles however.\r\n\r\nThe reason many people want
    to believe in the letterwise-decipherment model might be that they instinctively
    realize that the alternative would put them on a road that might not end (the
    white being essentially indeterminate). It is mystical, and in this age we are
    conditioned to shun that in favor of the determinate.\r\n\r\nBTW learning things

  body: "I have to admit that my personal bias is in favor of the primary mechanism
    in reading being letter by letter. However, I didn't find Larson's paper fully
    convincing, because proving that something is nonexistent is more difficult than
    proving its effect, if there, must be small.\r\n\r\nAs I noted, I was surprised
    by Hrant's suggestion that certain other scripts, usually viewed by Latin script
    users as much less legible, were more readable. This makes me think that there
    is a missing piece in the puzzle - have there been studies of the visual mechanisms
    used by native readers of the Arabic script, for example?\r\n\r\n<cite>Also, it's
    entirely routine for an experimental psychologist to miss the point.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat
    certainly happens, although it wasn't clear to me why this was likely to have
    been happening here.\r\n\r\nAnd then it dawned on me that perhaps the criticism
    being aimed at the paper might be this: experimental tests of reading speed and
    the like are more reliable as tests of legibility than readability. Efficiency
    and speed in reading short texts may depend primarily on legibility, while readability
    affects the effort required, and shows up in performance primarily when dealing
    with longer texts.\r\n\r\nIf, though, the definition of readability has retreated
    this far, I can see the aptness of Hrant's remarks about the mystical versus the
    determinate.\r\n\r\nA potential experimental test has occurred to me. If subjects
    are tested on reading effectiveness using different typefaces, including ones
    known to be highly readable (Baskerville, Imprint, Jenson Oldstyle) and ones known
    to be unsuited to extended reading (Helvetica, Futura) and performance differences
    don't show up in tests of the kind used to debunk Bouma, then that would show
    the tests <em>are</em> missing readability, and thus we're not dealing with false
    subjectivity.\r\n\r\nAlso, I seem to recall that some experiments were described
    in Typographical Printing Surfaces that crossed the divide between legibility
    and readability."

    the scientific research of Matthew Luckiesh, who first introduced the concept
    of readability as ease of reading extended text. Luckiesh collaborated with Linotype
    in the late 30s and we think his research is still relevant and important. He
    found that increase in blink rate over time indicated lower readability, that
    the text was more taxing to read in extended blocks.\r\n\r\nOur paper was published
    in December in [[https://hyphenpress.co.uk/products/books/978-0-907259-48-0|Typography

    rightly, I think that Kevin has conceded that Peter Enneson's theory of reading
    by whole word patterns of sub-letter parts is not hit by most of the objections
    in his survey paper.  The paper assumes that whole word theories are only looking
    at the 'envelope' of the outer outline of the word. \r\n\r\nOn the specific proposal

    and Georgian are more readable than Latin. So is Arabic, by a big margin. Hebrew
    is less readable. Thai is probably slightly inferior. Korean? Makes Latin look
    like a village idiot.</cite>\r\n\r\nled me to construct the sample alphabet shown
    above simply to ask Hrant if this was the sort of improvement the Latin alphabet
    could use. His full post was:\r\n\r\n<cite>You're way too rosy-eyed towards Latin.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Actually
    blackletter (I mean structurally, not necessarily most instances of it) is inherently
    more readable* than Latin:</cite>\r\n<cite>http://themicrofoundry.com/ss_fraktur1.html</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>*
    Not at all the same thing as \"legible\".</cite>\r\n<cite>And virtually nothing
    to do with \"literacy\".</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Armenian and Georgian are more readable
    than Latin. So is Arabic, by a big margin. Hebrew is less readable. Thai is probably
    slightly inferior. Korean? Makes Latin look like a village idiot.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    adoption/abandonment of a script has little to do with its readability, sadly.
    Especially in this age of idiotic democracy. And it has even less to do with familiarity.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Is
    it worth switching? Hmmm, is it worth learning math in school? It's so hard!...</cite>\r\n\r\nSo
    I was treating this as if it was my responsibility to find a way to save the Latin
    script; to improve its readability to match that of other, superior scripts, by
    whatever criteria Hrant is applying, in order to avoid the necessity of everyone
    in the Latin script world having to learn to read and write all over again. (Someone
    might ask: why am I taking this so seriously? Who has made Hrant Papazian emperor
    of the world? But while it is true there is no real deadline, if he has identified
    a real problem, it deserves to be examined.)\r\n\r\nAnd while lower-case is quite
    differentiated in the Latin alphabet, it's not the case that every word has a
    unique overall shape; ascenders and descenders aren't <em>that</em> frequent.
    This is why I thought having more of them would improve the odds.\r\n\r\nBut it
    wasn't just ease of adoption that led me to make the new ones smaller; if almost
    all the letters have ascenders, then the result is the same as if hardly any have
    ascenders, the words mostly have similar shapes; by having the new ascenders have
    a new height, I'm sure of increasing variety instead of decreasing it.\r\n\r\n(If
    my approach is valid, this would also mean that the Cyrillic script, where so
    many lower-case letters have a small capital form, is somewhat less readable than
    Latin. But I am not going to attempt a reformed Cyrillic at this stage, as I don't
    yet know if I've understood Hrant correctly.)\r\n\r\nSo when you say,\r\n\r\n<cite>On
    the specific proposal here, I am skeptical that it will help ease readability.
    That is because the roman lower case, particularly, is pretty highly differentiated.
    So I'm doubtful that additional differentiation will be of much help.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    am not disputing it. I thought that Latin was as differentiated as it needed to
    be too. But Hrant seems to be saying otherwise; so I am essentially here asking
    him if that was what he <em>did</em> say - or if it's something else entirely
    that is the limitation of the Latin script that he perceives. I'm not yet prepared
    to take a definitive position on whether script reform for Latin, such as the
    one I've tentatively proposed, or of a different nature, to improve readability
    <em>is</em> needed."
