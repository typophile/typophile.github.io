    click edit then delete\r\n2. Did you kern any pair of letters?\r\n3. Can you bring
    out / table all your ligatures? In a PDFile?\r\n4. If you want your font to be

    be good to have more and larger images or  PDF file so that we can better appreciate
    the work.\r\n\r\nAlso, can you be more specific about what it is you want to do
    with this design? Do you want to license it to users directly? Or find a foundry
    to do this for you? What do you want to do?\r\n\r\nEben Sorkin, Moderator"

    Foundries on web but could not guess which foundries are popular for arabic fonts.\r\nwhat
    should I do? license it directly by a new website or by font foundries?\r\nCan
    you provide me the links of some great arabic foundries?\r\nI will load some more

    MS Office add-in <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F1FC413C-6D89-4F15-991B-63B07BA5F2E5&displaylang=en\">'Save
    as PDF'</a>\r\n\r\n2. Open your Word document showing your font, and use the 'Save
    as PDF' add-in to generate the PDF.\r\n\r\nTypophile won't let you attach a PDF
    to a discussion comment, so you'll need to either upload the PDF to another website
    and provide a link from Typophile, or send the PDF to someone who can do this
    for you."

    offer you. This is not going to be a complete list and my apologies in advance
    if I am leaving out a foundry that sells & supports Arabic; but you might try
    contacting ( in no particular order):  Monotype/Linotype, Myfonts, Fontshop, Microsoft,
    Tiro Typeworks, Dalton Maag, Ascender, Typotheque, Sakkal Design & Adobe.\r\n\r\nYou
    also might want to contact Fiona Ross at Reading University.\r\n\r\nYou can also
