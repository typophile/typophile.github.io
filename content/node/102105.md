    to use it before. Ive used some Din condensed for other work Im branding myself
    on. Its to send out to various companies I see advertising, including design agencies.
    This is the first time 'rebranding' myself since college 3 years ago...so dont
    be fooled by my D.OB on here :)\r\n\r\nOk Im getting scared now and going to run
    back under my helvetica shell lol"

    like a solid choice.\r\n\r\nAs for a companion: I've been recommending Axia* a
    lot lately (hey, maybe I should use it on <em>my</em> r\xE9sum\xE9 :-). But it
    might be too strong.\r\n\r\n* http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/axia/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I was imagining it in Armenian and French!\r\n\r\nJoe, are you familiar with the
    history of the, [[http://www.din.de/cmd?lang=en&level=tpl-home&contextid=din&languageid=en|Deutsches
    Institut f\xFCr Normung]] as a standards body? I am intrigued that you identify
    with the fonts on a personal level. Whatever you do, don't run back to Helvetica!"

    level I just love how my name sits in Din bold...I could look at it every night,
    in fact thats exactly what I do. I wish there was a town in Germany named Joe90..just
    so I could have a sneaky perv driving by the sign in my V-Dub :)\r\n\r\nDas DIN
