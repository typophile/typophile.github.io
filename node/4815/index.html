  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all, this is my first post here. I stumbled upon this site today and I was quite impressed. I havent had a chance to totaly look at everything yet but It was really interesting to the progression of some of the identities.  <BR> <BR>Anyways I am a high school student, my name is Tom and I am from Toronto, Canada. I am looking forward to my experience here :D <BR> <BR>A few friends of my parents who run small business and have a tight budget have given me the opportunity to do some small design jobs for them. <BR> <BR>I just got one to design a logo for a company that sells a variety of different UPS units to deliver uninterupted power protection incase the power goes out. they are called &quot;UPS For Less&quot; <BR> <BR>Here are my first few ideas, I am having a bit of trouble finding a type face to suit this and I am still working on the icon, which is a sheild combined with a power symbol. Any help would be much appretiated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36129.jpg" alt="Samples"> <BR> <BR>Thanks!</div>

I'd play around with that.  <BR> <BR>As for the name, I don't think they would be in danger. They aren't in the shipping business, and there are other UPS outfits, e.g. <a href="http://www.minutemanups.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.minutemanups.com/">http://www.minutemanups.com/</a></a> (who use a plug in their logo). <BR> <BR>However, if United Parcel Service does decide to sue them, there will be lots of publicity. So, design a logo you would be proud to see on the 6 o'clock news!</div>

You can certainly keep the face you have, but add more space.  <BR> <BR>In the meantime, I've been poking around looking at varous other UPS system logos.
