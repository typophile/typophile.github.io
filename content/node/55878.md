body: Hello everyone, can anybody please help me identifying this font? It is hand
  painted, but really really beautiful. Looks like it is a street artist.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/23_4817.jpg]

  body: "As you say, it is hand painted. I don't think it is based on a font. The
    'a' is similar to some Celtic style scripts, but the rest of the lettering is
    nothing like them. Except for the 'a', the closest similar style I can suggest
    is [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script04Pg14.html|Flourish]], by Judith Sutcliffe
    (shown in the top three samples on this page in the Script Font ID Guide).\r\n\r\n

  body: "Hi Mike, thanks a lot for your help, I appreciate.\r\nI guess you might be
    right, this could be an original font by the artist.\r\nI fell for it, he uses
    it for writing pieces of poetry.\r\nI'll wait and see if anybody can see some
    other similar fonts.\r\nSilvia"

  body: "It really is a mix of styles; Compressed oblique n, a few celtic characters,
    and some really strange top heavy s'. A bit too inconsistent for my taste. I think
    it is just letters the sign painter liked grouped together rather than a font.
    It might be worth your while to look up either celtic or uncial for styles and
    see what you get.\r\n\r\nHere is Uncial search from MyFonts:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=uncial\r\n\r\nOne
    with similar a and e.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/carlomagno-nd/\r\n"
