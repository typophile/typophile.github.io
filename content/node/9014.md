  body: Very nice. The cap R looks a bit narrow, tho as I can&#39;t find one in your
    text setting, it may look fine in text.

  body: Very very neath work, I agree on the &#34;R&#34; and also find the &#34;K&#34;
    a bit ackward. I like the font and would like to see heavier weights someday.
    <BR> <BR>Congratulations.

  body: Very nice work, I can&#39;t imagine this is your first as the quality, consistency
    and concept is top notch.  <BR>Critique? B, P, R are a hair small in context.
    also, how about an open numeral 4.

  body: Proper work. Additionally to the previous critiques i have my doubts about
    the lc &#39;g&#39;. It is alien in this alphabet - look at your textsetting. The
    same applies to the &#39;sz&#39; which in fact is a greek &#39;beta&#39; .

  body: Simon, <BR> <BR>Great work!  I like the quirky lc &#39;g&#39; and the lc &#39;a&#39;
    is nice too with its small bowl.  Keep up to good work!
