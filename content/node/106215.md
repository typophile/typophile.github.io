body: "Dear Typophile forum,\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a foundry that could help
  with internationalising a typeface (5 fonts)?\r\nTo start with, I would need all
  Latin based characters:\r\nLatin Extended Additional\r\nLatin Extended-A\r\nLatin
  Extended-B\r\nLatin Extended-C\r\nLatin Extended-D\r\n(= 500 new glyphs).\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  also Russin, Ukranian, Kazhak, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Mongolian, Uzbek, Greek, Hebrew,
  Kurdish, Arabic, Farsi, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Hindi.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
