body: I have a linguistic book project coming up that involves an African language
  written in the Latin alphabet. I&#39;d love to be able to set the text in an African-designed
  text font, but all I&#39;ve been able to locate so far are decorative fonts. &#40;Setting
  a dictionary in an alphabet based on birds probably won&#39;t please too many users!&#41;
  <BR> <BR>Any pointers?

  body: I don&#39;t know of any text fonts made in Africa&#42;. Except maybe if you
    include Egypt, but even then I personally don&#39;t know one. One option might
    be to go with something Joshua Darden has designed - although they don&#39;t necessarily
    look African. And really, anything that&#39;s <i>strongly</i> African -or of any
    other landmass, or even any group of people- wouldn&#39;t be a good text face.
    Text is all about subtlety, which does however leave room for some expression.
    For example if you believe that Africa has preserved its respect for Nature whereas
    much of the rest of the world has lost it, you might use one of the &#34;fauve&#34;
    fonts from Eastern Europe or South America. <BR> <BR>&#42; Look to Saki Mafundikwa
    for display work. <BR> <BR>Lastly, there&#39;s Gentium by Gaultney. Victor is
    not African, and there&#39;s nothing inherently African about Gentium really &#40;unless
    you think chirography is fauve - not a implausible idea&#41; but it does happen
    to be one of the very few typefaces designed to serve African languages, and serve
    them well. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I understand that many Latinized African languages require combining mark
    combinations that are not precomposed in Unicode. So another limiting factor &#40;if
    you want to use an OpenType Unicode encoded font rather than a hack-encoded font&#41;
    would be support for combining marks - if so &#39;Doulos SIL&#39; might be worth
    looking at.     <BR> <BR>Si

    from criticism using European or US fonts.'

    I was just surprised that there were no text faces designed in Africa.

  body: Excuse was a bad choice. If Saki Mafundikwa didn&#39;t have access to a good
    quality African produced text font then there probably aren&#39;t many choices.
    Perhaps you could work one of Brode Vosloo&#39;s display fonts into the book.  <BR>
