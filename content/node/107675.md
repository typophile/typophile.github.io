  in the attached visuals. I understand that these may be custom but the closest equivalent
  would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nLooking to identify the \"DETROIT\" on the front of
  the jersey, numbers on the back, \"player name - DATSYUK\" and \"C\" and \"A\" on
  the sleeves.\r\n\r\nThanks for any assistance with this.\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0407-det14wc-jersey_4705.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wc2014zetterberg_5836.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Redwings4_3569.jpg]\r\n"
