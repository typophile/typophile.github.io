  I didn&#39;t find anything in that vein. Any other suggestions? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19786.gif"

    &#40;which in fact means I now have to keep the  <BR>Type ID Board clean all by
    myself&#41;, maybe it&#39;s time to  <BR>look for a more dignified picture or
    symbol to represent  <BR>myself. Black bow-tie anyone? Or should I use a monogram?

  body: I found this at dafont.com. It&#39;s close but not the same. The README file
    is a fascinating read for the history of the font. Perhaps the only time that
    the &#39;README&#39; imperative has ever been justified. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
