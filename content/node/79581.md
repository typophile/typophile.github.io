    it says:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nCabernet Regular Set\r\nby Jukebox Type\r\nSee all
    fonts in this collection\r\nA digital revival of a vintage, Caslon-style photo-typesetting
    face. The character set has been expanded and modernized. Heavy yet upbeat, the
    true vitality of this typeface emerges with use of the swash variant. The swash
    font contains several additional alternate characters, including alternate cap
    A, K,L, M, N, V, W, Y and lowercase ligatures for 'ki', 'ri', 'vi', and 'wi'.
    The character set has been expanded and modernized from the original.\r\nThis
    package contains:\r\n\r\nCabernet Regular, Swash\r\n\r\nCopyright \xA9 Jason Walcott
    / Jukebox / Veer</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhile the proper name of the copyright holder
    may not necessarily be the same individual as the designer, it's sufficient grounds
    for further investigation. Note that this is a revival of an earlier photo-typesetting
    face, and may have been marketed under a different name when produced in its original
    form, and the original designer may be someone other than who did the digital
    conversion."

  body: "Ah...I just connected that Cabernet was probably a re-imagining of Caslon
    Black Swash.  I had already researched Caslon Black Swash for over an hour with
    no success of a design year.  Perhaps I should change my question to:\r\n\r\nWhat
    year was Caslon Black Swash designed?  And (foolish question, but I am rather
    new to typography) I assume any font designated as Caslon would have been designed
    by William Caslon himself? \r\n"

    co-opted for any number of designs, not all of which bear any true relationship
    to the faces cut by the original William Caslon or the Caslon Type Foundry, and
    some only distantly related. So it is wise to do research."
