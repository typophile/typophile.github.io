  body: "There are at least twelve different typefaces shown in the samples, plus
    the seven identified by name. You can probably locate a number of them by searching
    for Wood Type, Victorian, Latin and Tuscan on a site like myfonts.com. The \u201Cstriped\u201D
    typeface in the first example is Atlas; I believe that Harold Lohner has a version
    of it available."

  body: Agree Jan, thanks for correcting me and giving the official version name for
    Vineta. Definitely not matching for "FRESH FISH" but I still believe it's quite
    close (even matching) for "POISSONS FRAIS".
