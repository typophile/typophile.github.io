  managed to hit 'no' by accident. Luckily, I had one more file open and InDesign
  prompted me if i wanted to save that one. After hitting Cancel, I opened a new file,
  saved the other and force-quit InDesign remembering that it has a pretty decent
  crash recovery system.\r\n\r\nLo and behold, when I relaunched, there was the document
  I had told inDesign not to save.\r\n\r\nOf course, be careful when doing this, perhaps
  there is a more elegant solution?"

    and recovering from crashing.
