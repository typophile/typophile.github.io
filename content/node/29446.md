  body: I'd say that <a/href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.htm?pid=201220">ITC
    Avant Garde Demi Bold</a> is most of it, the 'Haie' part, but the 'r' has been
    tweaked by hand.

    body: It's not ITC Avant Garde Demi Bold. Look at the "e" in the logotype its
      more open, the "H" is wider, the end of the "r" cuts off at an angle. Actually
      looking at ITC Avant Garde Gothic Demi Bold at a larger scale I can also see
      that the "a" is different too. The "i" looks the same though. How do I reopen
      this post?

  body: "Even if they are originally based on a typeface, the individual characters
    in logos are often tweaked for harmony or visual effect. I'm with Ben -- this
    probably started life as Avant Garde and was stretched/manipulated by the designer.
    Not very well, IMHO: look at how thick the r is compared to the e, for example.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    if you just need the logo as artwork, go here:\r\n\r\nhttp://brandsoftheworld.com/search/?query_id=899873&page=1&mtype=&brand_id=147482"

    body: "Yea, I think the letters are from different typefaces.\r\n\r\nThanks for
      the link, but I'm not really interested in the logotype itself, but the actual
      typeface. That is if it is a typeface."

    You don't have to reopen this post \u2013 it's not 'solved'. Other people will
    contribute if they feel they can give you a more definitive answer, as Mark has
    done. \r\n\r\nHow about I tell you that the Haier logotype is NotFutura?"

    did tag the post as solved with ITC Avant Garde Gothic, Ben, as this is clearly
    no font but a customisation of the aforementionned design. I reopened it upon
    Ferdinand's request, even though I'm convinced this is a wild goose chase. There
    is no font that looks like that."
