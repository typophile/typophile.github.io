body: "Stephen King once said (I believe it was in On Writing) that he could tell
  a lot about a person by what books they own.  There's quite a bit of truth in this
  statement.  I can tell a lot about people just by examining the odds and ends they
  keep around their home.  People will usually buy things that reflect their particular
  tastes.\r\n\r\nAs a designer this fascinates me. Thinking about this I happened
  to glance at my coffee cup and an idea hit me; I should start a thread here on Typophile
  where everyone could share something from their own life that reflects their love
  of typography.\r\n\r\nFor me it has always been anything old and ornate.  Last year
  about this time I had the opportunity to participate in a Photoshop Design contest.
  \ The challenge was to design a billboard ad for Photoshop in the past or future.
  \ I had no idea what I was going to make until I visited Leterheadfonts and spotted
  Tom Kennedy's gorgeous Billhead font.  Looking at the old letterhead samples he
  had made (to display the font) I was inspired to create an early 1900's billboard
  advertising Photoshop.  The challenge was to conceive of how this ad would present
  the program during that time period; what terminology would they use to describe
  the program? what pictures (if any) could I use to convey the message?\r\n\r\nIt
  took me about three weeks to come up with my final billboard design.  Unfortunately,
  I did not even place in the finals, but Denise Buyers of Letterheadfonts offered
  to display my design in their Gallery section.  I was honored.  If you're curious
  you can see the design there or visit it [[http://photoshopcafe.com/contests/contest-5-finalists.htm|here]]
  on the PhotoshopCafe design challenge page.\r\n\r\nSo began my love of old typography
  and a more devoted search for \"old things\" to display around my home, including
  this great old coffee mug that I found one day when me and my mom were visiting
  an antique shop here in town.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coffeemug_3463.png]\r\n\r\nSo
  do you own anything that communicates your deep, abiding love of typography/design?
  Show it off here :)"

    word, \u2018\u795D\u2019, on the collar of the right cat means \u2018to congratulate\u2019,
    \u2018to wish\u2019 or \u2018to pray\u2019 and the word, \u2018\u958B\u904B\u2019,
    on the legs of the right cat means \u2018to have a better luck\u2019. \u2018\u958B\u2019
    means \u2018open\u2019, and \u2018\u904B\u2019 means \u2018luck\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe
    cat on the right is a good-luck charm.\r\n\r\nThe word, \u2018\u5343\u4E07\u4E21\u2019,
    on the legs of the left cat means ten million ryo\u2019s (\u2018ryo\u2019 is an
    old Japanese currency). In other words, it means a great deal of money.\r\n\r\nThe
    cat on the left is an amulet which gives you money.\r\n"

    <em>the Holy Grail</em> one such example sold for over $2 million.\""

  body: "- <em>what is the significance of the misspelling?</em> \r\n\r\nelis died
    last year, at 99 years of age, angry until the end. He said he had been born three
    times as an artist. I'm most familiar with his two last incarnations, characterized
    by his both childish and aggressive onomatopoetic works, of which this is one.
    The significance is perhaps better explained by Karl Nyberg, who wrote this for
    an exhibition at the Modern Museum in Stockholm: \r\n\r\n<em>His classic phrase
    \u201CH\xC5LL TJEFTEN\u201D (SHUT YOUR GAB!) incites revolt and represents a refusal
    to submit to repressive norms, both linguistic and social. A peculiar writing
    style is one of the most characteristic features of Eriksson\u2019s art. By making
    his own dyslexia a distinctive and individual form of expression, he turns accepted
    values on their head. What is normally seen as a restriction becomes instead his
    strength.</em>\r\n\r\nMore pictures of his work <a href=\"http://www.gallerilarsbohman.com/books.asp?art_name=Elis%20Eriksson\">here</a>
    and the rest of the quoted text <a href=\"http://www.modernamuseet.se/v4/templates/template1.asp?lang=Eng&id=2873\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nLet's
    just say that everytime I look at it I can feel a tiny bit subversive when everything
    I do is not. \r\n\r\n- <em>What an awesome view from that window. What kind of
    work do you do?</em> \r\n\r\nI'm a (typo)graphic designer, and as the myth goes,
    we must have inspiring work environments to be \"creative\". "
