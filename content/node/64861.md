  body: "When I first saw it I thought it was  Folio Extra-Bold but this one is less
    \"square,\" and not so geometric like Proxima Nova or Gotham. The \"o\" looks
    a little like Dobra Black. I love the o!\r\nI cannot find the campaign online
    \u2014So maybe I could show a better sample of a Oxford Health Insurance campaign
    I found on a telephone booth...\r\n\r\npatty\r\n"
