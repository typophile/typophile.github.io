  body: 'I''ve found a number of good newspaper design books at used book stores.
    I''m not sure about contemporary titles but there are plenty of old ones from
    back in the day. The one I have at my desk right now is titled Functional Newspaper
    Design and it''s one of my favorite books (mainly because it''s full of clippings
    and letters from the previous owner, who was an editor at the Detroit Free Press
    during the 60''s). Try some old book shops or ebay. "Newspaper Design" would probably
    be a good search term. '

  body: honestly, i would really suggest books on grid systems and typographic hierarchy.
    These two things, IMHO, are the most important aspects of a newspaper. The book
    on grid systems that I would recommend would be this one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3721201450/ref=wl_it_dp/104-0529799-6655911?%5Fencoding=UTF8&colid=J1SPAXLSVHA0&coliid=I2DHVK79XGR5SU&v=glance&n=283155">Grid
    Systems in Graphic Design by Josef Muller-Brockmann</a>I am sure you already have
    books on typography, so I wont bother mentioning any here, unless you need me
    to.

  body: 'I''ve used a good basic book called "Newspaper Designer''s Handbook" by Tim
    Harrower, that comes with a CD-Rom. It''s spiral bound and is sort of a step by
    step guide to newspaper design. It has lots of examples and design ideas and I
    thought it was well explained and presented. '
