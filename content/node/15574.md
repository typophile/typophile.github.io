  help me out. My problem is that when I try to convert text to paths in Freehand
  MX the resulting text is nothing more than rubbish.\r\nIf anybody can lend a hand
  in how to remedy this I would be very thankful.\r\nCheers\r\nRay"

    I fear Freehand is a dead application when Adobe is done with it. Maybe they will
    try to sell it, but more likely they will let it die.
