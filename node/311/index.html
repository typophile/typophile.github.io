<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>In my friday fonts efforts, I'm getting close to having one weight just the way I want it. Next I <br>want to start thinking about other weights. What is the "right" way to go about this. I have <br>a regular version, and I want a light, regular, bold, and heavy. <br> <br>In looking through the FontLab pdf manual I got this idea: If I draw up the heavy version <br>next, taking care to use similar points to define the outlines, can I use that and the <br>regular version I have to create a multiple master for the bold? From there, I could <br>extrapolate to the light version. I imagine it will take some tweeking to get these intermediate <br>weights the way I want them. <br> <br>My questions are these: <br>How hard is it to set up a mulitple master from two weights? How much tweaking is <br>neccessary? Will this save time, or cause more of a headache? Does this make any <br>sense at all? <br> <br>Thanks for your thoughts! <br>Randy</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>You'll get different answers about the "right way", but to me best compromise is what I did in Patria: <br> <br>1) Assuming you have a non-extreme weight at hand, use the software's "weight change" to make the light and dark extremes. Confine to the x-axis. <br>2) Tweak like there's no tomorrow, specifically by decreasing the contrast in the light extreme while increasing it in the dark. But you should also adjust the overshoots: the lighter the greater. <br>3) Create a new intermediate of where you started, and compare it to your original. Assuming you still like your original better, tweak the two extremes (not the resultant intermediate) to get back to where your original was. <br>4) Once you end up with extremes that you like, and they generate your original intermediate weight to your liking, you're done. You shouldn't have to tweak any intermediates at all. In general. :-) <br> <br>Two words of caution: <br>1) Very light weights reveal problems in stroke thickness very obviously. <br>2) Very dark weights can get too pudgy. It takes a lot of expertise to put the sparkle in them - few people can manage - I for one can't. Look at the darkest weights of Galliard for guidance there. <br> <br>BTW, you don't have to make an actual MM font - in fact most users would have trouble with that! Just have your axis "internal" to your font app, and generate the necessary intermediate weights. Four weights is a good number - too many weights and some users can get confused. If you have very light and dark weights, go to 6. <br> <br>Spacing the weight gradation is v e r y t r i c k y ... and very open to personal preference. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Good tips, Hrant, but I avoid using automated "Change Weights". <br>I don't think it's worth it. A lot of tweaking will be necessary <br>anyway, so I just "change weights" myself, manually. It's like <br>splitting together your steps 1 and 2. ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Randy - <br> <br>As Eduardo and Hrant have pointed out, there really isn't a correct way to do this. Maybe try it both ways on a few glyphs and compare the results. It could be a nice experiment. I prefer Eduardo's approach. I draw one extreme and then paste it into the mask layer in FL 4.5 and use it as a reference for drawing the other extreme weight.</div>

<div class=commentbody>FontLab 4.5 ships with a demo Python script called 'Family Generator', which automatically produces a Light, Bold and Heavy design from a Regular. Of course, the results are never perfect and always require manual editing to clean them up, but depending on your design this can be surprisingly effective as a first step. The other thing to realise, of course, is that you can <i>edit the Python script</i>, and so tailor the weight and width adjustments made by the script to your design.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Another consideration if you're truly considering producing <br>a Multiple Master--OS X supports MMs, albeit with sticks <br>and chicken wire. I can get them to display, but printing <br> and creating outlines wreaks havoc. From what I've read, <br> MMs are on the way out.</div>

<div class=commentbody>i think kyle is absolutely right. forget multiple master, it's hardly breathing anymore. <br> <br>there probably isn't a correct way and it usually depends on the kind of design you're working on. i personally have found it to be efficient to work both ways at the same time. you can use the "change weight comand - resize to x-height" as a sort of reference and also to get your accents, punctuation etc. you still have to tweak those, but it's less of a hassle then also tweaking all the main letters from that. those you should definately draw manually. <br> <br>it also helps layering all weights of one character atop of each other and optimizing the "new" weights right there in one window in comparisson with your finished regular weight.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Multiple master fonts never were a big hit commercially. I've got about three dozen of them and I think that was about how many were made. <br> <br>But, they do work well on pre-OS X systems and, quite frankly, will for quite some time. OS X didn't exactly come out during the best of economic times and it still hasn't pulled over the "majority" of folks, or so the reports from MacWorld indicate. <br> <br>Problem with Multiple Masters was that they were &#149;&#149;&#149;-backwards. Works better to extrapolate from the medium point not interpolate from the end points. Like QuickDraw GX did back in 1994. <br> <br>Still waiting, and waiting for OpenType to look spectacular. Starting to look like just another format isn't it? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>no -- that's why it's called RoboFab (a name that could be expanded into something like Robotic Fabulous FontLab). There is more in-depth comments about the ideas behind it on the FontLab-Scripting list: <a href=http://mail.letterror.com/pipermail/fontlab-scripting/2003-July/thread.html target=_blank>http://mail.letterror.com/pipermail/fontlab-scripting/2003-July/thread.html</a> <br>(just read everything for July). <br>The RoboFog MkII was supposed to be free of the Fontographer code, but it seemed like completely writing a font editor in Python from scratch was a bit too heavy. But now, with Just's FontTools (in-depth technical font manipulation) and Yuri's FontLab (a more abstract and more universal toolset), the Dutch Connection and House's Tal Leming seem to be back in game <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br>Adam</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>One should consider that multiple master can be used as a design tool, without ever generating multiple master fonts in the end. Most recent Adobe fonts were designed in MM space, without ever being built as MMs. <br> <br>Personally, I would add a weight axis to the regular, design the black weight, extrapolate the light weight, set it as the new master at the light end, and then clean it up. <br> <br>One good piece of advice Robert Slimbach gave me on the family I'm working on right now was that designing the extreme masters and interpolating really helps the intermediate weights come out better. It forces you to fix things in the extreme masters that might not be so noticeable in intermediate weights. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>So you're saying that when you design type you should design the light and the black and then get your regular and other weights by morphing between the two instead of drawing each weight separately?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, "should" is to strong a word. I'm saying you <b>can</b> do it, and that for anything more than three weights it can be faster (although maybe not the first time you do it). Plenty of very nice typefaces have been developed this way, including most of Robert Slimbach's designs. <br> <br>There are cases where you wouldn't want to do it this way, or where you'd use an intermediate master on the weight axis (something that FontLab doesn't directly support). <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>> design the light and the black and then get your regular <br> <br>I think that's dangerous. The <i>eventual</i> Regular might be better interpolated from the extremes, but since the Regular is the heart of the design (in terms of usage), the extremes should really spawn from it. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I heard Jonathan Hoefler describe the development of <br><a href=http://www.typography.com/catalog/champion/index.html target=_blank>Champion</a> in the same way Thomas describes. Of <br>course that was 4 years ago, so I'll have to fudge the <br>details. But in essence the method is to start with the <br>regular weight, then manually design the extremes (the <br>widest black and the narrowest thin). Then have the <br>software create the basis for the intermediate weights. (If <br>my memory is correct, the software would've generated 3 <br>weights of Champion.) Then of course, there is a lot of <br>cleanup work to do to add some human care/finesse to the <br>intermediate weights. <br> <br>In other words, the computer can help take some of the <br>tedium out of the process, but it can't make up for <br>attention to detail.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> there is a lot of cleanup <br> <br>Unless it's an overly complex design with an inherent issue with interpolation, I find that iteratively tweaking the extremes to get intermediates that don't need any adjustments themselves (except correcting rounding errors) is of great benefit. The reason isn't just design elegance, it's practicality: if you change your mind about what the intermediate(s) should be, or if a client wants a custom instance later on, it's much quicker. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
