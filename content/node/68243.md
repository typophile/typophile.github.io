  body: "Neo-grotesk does not actually refer to style. The term neo-grotesk was invented
    to aggrandize the use of Helvetica, Univers, and Folio by certain designers working
    in the Swiss international style. The stylistic features\u2014mechanical refinement
    and and horizontal terminals\u2014that some claim differentiate the genre from
    its predecessors can all be found in older typefaces. "
