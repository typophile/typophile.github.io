  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve started a series of articles on <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/">Unzipped</a> about type design. These are intended to be an introduction, to explain to novices what type design is. In the <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=161">first episode</a>, I dwell a little on the motivation of designers to start on a new typeface.</p>
<p>[[Peter Bilak]] reacted in an e-mail, and this comment had me particularly intrigued:</p>
<p><em>“(&hellip;) to explore other motivations for designing type. I am sure there is more than craft/technology versus art. (&hellip;) I am wondering myself what are the motivations to create type, besides the two obvious ones: problem solving, and urge to express oneself artistically. I used peculiarities of language as inspiration for making Eureka and Greta. A new Typotheque project embraces entire typographic history as a single source of inspiration, so the result is poly-historical. But again, these are personal stands, and I am wondering what else can serve as inspiration; these are the issues I discuss with my students when they are starting their type projects.&quot;</em></p>
<p>So I thought it would be interesting to post his question here and listen what other motivations might be a reason to start on a new type design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Except for the obvious reasons Peter Bilak stated, I think all reasons to do anything spring from an interest. And once past the point of passive interest, it&rsquo;s only a small step for curiousity and a self challenging attitude to get you started. It&rsquo;s also the best way to learn about something. For the professionals out there, hunger &amp; the need to get food on the table might also be a good motivation ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am not a type designer, but as a graphic designer one of the reasons I am constantly looking for new typefaces is because as they are put out in the world and used they get associations attached to them. This of course can work for us in reinforcing the meaning

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Besides the &ldquo;two obvious ones&rdquo; (which they are) there&rsquo;s a distinct third one in non-Latin type design: politics (if in the loose sense). Certainly not every non-Latin type designer thinks in those terms - in fact some try hard not to! But whenever you see something like Nour&amp;Patria, or even something like a Hellenicized Latin (Carter&rsquo;s Skia; Michail Semoglu&rsquo;s work) you can safely assume there&rsquo;s some &ldquo;culture-clash&rdquo; undercurrent at work there.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the &ldquo;ideological&rdquo; motivation, which is not as rare as one might suspect. Think of the 20th century&rsquo;s penchant for making type &ldquo;rational&rdquo; = sans. But think also of Legato, which embodies what Evert (and I as well to a good extent) thinks type <cite>should</cite> be, irrespective of sales, personal expression, etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The concept of &ldquo;classic&rdquo; not as an object but as a relation.
Indeed, it’s not the apple (Newton’s, but you may associate it to the computer tool as well) or the magic moment that matters much, it’s the <a href="http://typophile.com/comment/reply/34183/206219">work</a> before and after. Big thoughts are fun to romanticize, but it’s many small insights coming together that bring big ideas into the world.
It’s no accident that type designers study type.
Part of the challenge of innovation is coming up with the problem to solve, not just its solution ; according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson">Dyson</a> <em>“it’s very important to be idle&hellip; people who keeps themself busy all the time are generally not creative.”</em>
A typeface is like a fact, and a fact is like a sack——it won’t stand up till you’ve put something in it. So, evolution in type design probably means only that what’s on top is fit for the current environment, not that it’s “better.”</div>

It&rsquo;s about the choice of an environment (design) &amp; an appropriate fontstyle (text, display, script,&hellip;). This originates from either a given job or a personal desire to create, but then the motivations are respectively &ldquo;problem solving&rdquo; and &ldquo;the urge to express oneself artistically&rdquo; as Peter Bilak stated.</div>

<p>Bilak says &ldquo;problem solving&rdquo; but I would add &ldquo;puzzle solving&rdquo; and stress that they are different things. The former is in service of a need, a use; the latter is compulsive play.

<p>You have to be kidding! Type designers, like other loads of other people, can indeed be arrogant, but this is hardly a high-flying-gather-around-groupies-let-me-snort-coke-off-your-tits-while-watch-myself-in-the-mirror-flexing-my-muscles occupation.</p>

<p>Hmmm. You, know, George Orwell once wrote down what he considered the four motivations for writing, and numero uno on his list was&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. Sheer egoism. Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc. etc. It is humbug to pretend that this is not a motive, and a strong one. Writers share this characteristic with scientists, artists, politicians, lawyers, soldiers, successful businessmen &ndash; in short, with the whole top crust of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes on to list the other motives: aesthetic enthusiasm, historical impulse and political purpose&hellip; in that order. And then he adds,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be seen how these various impulses must war against one another, and how they must fluctuate from person to person and from time to time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Taken from &ldquo;Why I Write,&rdquo; first published in 1946.)</p>

<p>Me too&hellip; Without the help I -as well as 90% of the type designers out there apparantly- should get, I usually can&rsquo;t be bothered after having drawn it. The whole kerning part is so dreadful to me that I just can&rsquo;t get past the drawing point. But -as always- the most effective solutions are also the most simple ones. My solution to my problem: limiting myself to monospaced &amp; connected script typefaces.</p>

<p>Last but not least: arrogance: it&rsquo;s just an extent of vanity.
None of us who would be here sharing our ideas if we weren&rsquo;t. The modest don&rsquo;t broadcast their ideas &amp; designs.</p>

<p>This is actually a very interesting paradox, and one that some desginers never experience; some of them have even reacted a bit violently when I&rsquo;ve suggested it myself: when you use a font, in a way you&rsquo;re violating it. Not because of some virginity envy, but because a font is really an abstract thing that&rsquo;s qualitatively greater than any instance of its usage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even though I do occasionally feel the above, I do also generally feel very good when I hit some keystrokes in a new font! And that&rsquo;s in fact the norm with type designers as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Well, to give you another paradox, I strongly believe modesty &amp; pride can go hand in hand. It&rsquo;s a question of being able to objectively judge yourself which -I know- sounds like a complete contradiction. I can only speak for myself when I say I&rsquo;m probably my best (or worse, depends on how you interprete it) criticist &amp; I&rsquo;m sure there are more people out there like me. Being your own judge has the adventage that you can take everything into account which is something an outsider can&rsquo;t do. You know where you&rsquo;re coming from, where you wanted to go (and your limits as to how far you can go at a certain point) &amp; where you ended up &amp; how you got there. So even a modest person can be openly proud when he has achieved something in his own best potential. This obviously often gets confused with arrogance, but for that I refer to a previous post of mine in this thread ;-)</p>

<p>Maybe&hellip; All I know is that I&rsquo;m the hardest one to please when it comes to my designs, but maybe that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m just hanging with the wrong crowd? ;-p
I have to admit though that I can never immediately judge my own work. Time is the final judge &amp; if something survives its test (which at least takes more than a few months if not years in my case), I think it&rsquo;s pretty safe to say you&rsquo;ve done a good job. Usually I&rsquo;m displeased with something after a while, but that&rsquo;s because people evolve. And even in all my malcontent with a certain design, I can still tell if it&rsquo;s the best I could do at the time.
Even my therapist (yes, I&rsquo;m a mental case, didn&rsquo;t you notice? ;-p ) says I should try to be a little less hard on myself. She&rsquo;s obviously speaking in general terms, but I for one know it applies best to my work. I consider my work as something holy (yes, I am aware of how corny that sounds) &amp; in that view I try my hardest to be a good &ldquo;believer&rdquo; &amp; I consider self-flagellation part of that ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We humans are social animals, and we all desire the positive regard of others. This factor of &lsquo;ego&rsquo; or pride is an important motivator, and can take positive and negative forms.</p>
<p>The positive form of pride is that the person is aware of his or her gifts, and wants to use them to benefit others, and enjoy the process of doing the work. And they will enjoy the honor that comes from their contribution.</p>
<p>Einstein put it beautifully when he wrote: &ldquo;The most important motive for work in the school and in life is the pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The negative form of pride is arrogance, when one tries to build one&rsquo;s self up by not listening to others, tearing them down and dominating them.</p>
<p>Added:</p>
<p>Tom, I think you are confusing criticism of one&rsquo;s own work and running one&rsquo;s self down as a person. On the latter many are their own worst enemies, yes, and that is no good.</p>
<p>But on criticism of one&rsquo;s own work, that it is rarely the case. First of all most people will be totally indifferent to your work, which is the worst criticism. Second, those with greater or even equal experience and expertise will see things you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I completely agree with Kris on the benefit of an outside editor, particularly when you are starting out. I certainly have followed that principle, and have recommended it to others. And I am delighted to see that with that with that additional input Kris is going &lsquo;from strength to strength&rsquo; as a type designer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To me, the motivation the start and the stumbling block to finish a typeface are one and the same: the micro/macro nature of type design. There&rsquo;s nothing like exporting your little collection of micro creations and feasting your eyes on a big fat macro paragraph of text for the first time.  Exporting for the 1000th time to compare some rediculous detail is no where near as intoxicating as: [cue caveman voice] &ldquo;I have make font from nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s loads of other reasons, but for me, this was the hook.</p>
