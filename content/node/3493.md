    target="_blank"> FF Meta</a>, and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if  <BR><a href="http://www.orangeitalic.com/fonts/index.html"

    version.

    font but a custom designed mast head. Unfortunately the  <BR>&#34;masthead&#34;section
    is not yet up at Orangeitalic, so I can&#39;t check.'

    target="_blank">Amplitude</a> is different, and the trap in the r is more pronounced.
    I know from past ID&#39;s the inside does use Amplitude, but I suspect this is
    different. '

    - not stoopid, stoopid, stoopid in your first comments. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-meta/bold-roman/testdrive.html?s=Wallpaper&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Meta</a> has shapes that are so close to this, that your idea
    of a re-worked Meta is probably a very good bet. As I said, it isn&#39;t Amplitude
    - look also at the tops of the stems, which are different. '
