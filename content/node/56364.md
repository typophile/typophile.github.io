  They have never had one before so their current logo is not exactly online friendly.
  Specifically the type it uses is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/american-uncial|American
  Uncial]] (kudos to raph for the ID), which is heavily serif'ed and virtually illegible
  in smaller sizes when rasterized.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I'd explore some type options
  to present them for the online use. My first choice is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/hightower/|Hightower]]
  followed by [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/centaur/|Centaur]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/jenson/|Jenson]].\r\n\r\nI
  realize that my choices is a pretty far departure from the Uncial. It'd be of course
  ideal to find the type that is similar to Uncial, but with a bit more \"modern\"
  feel to it. Any suggestions ?\r\n\r\nIn general, what type you guys think would
  work well for the ID of the engravers ?\r\n"

    is printed with the intaglio method and that would give an immediate suggestion
    of what their process is and why it is desirable. Uncial wouldn't be right for
    this. Maybe something more like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/smackeroo-nf/|Smackeroo
    NF]].\r\n"

  body: "Ha. What an interesting take on a question. They don't really print <em>the
    money</em> though :) They do a lot of really elegant and upscale work and the
    problem with Smackeroo is that it doesn't exactly imply either of these to me.
    \r\n\r\nI was thinking more of a lighter serif type that would work well in smaller
    sizes. That's where the Hightower & Co. came from.\r\n"

  body: If anyone's interested, we went with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/hightower/|Hightower]]
    and also lightened the logo a bit for the online use. From [[http://swapped.cc/stuff/tmp/westeng-original.png|this]]
