    the K, lower the crossbar on the A, and add a wing to the B, then faux italicize
    the works, and you're pretty close.\r\n\r\nFairview could be edited to work:\r\nhttp://www.losttype.com/font/?name=fairview\r\n\r\nThese

  body: "Americain is a good find Kevin. \r\nIf you use the lower case instead of
    the upper, it seems that there is no need to do some of the editing because the
    _k_ is already inverted and  the crossbar on the _a_is already low. Still need
    to add a wing to the _b_ and slope all.\r\nDon"
