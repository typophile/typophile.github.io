body: I have 2 weights that I have designed in FontLab - and I don't know if it makes
  a difference, but they are two individual vfb files. How can I export these files
  to come up in Adobe Illustrator as "roman" and "oblique" in the character menu?
  Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks.

    on both. Then you can File>Generate Font as whatever format you require. \r\nThe
    Font Info box needs lots more details inputting too...the diamond icon is pretty
    useful to auto complete the options for you."
