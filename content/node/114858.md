body: "I'm trying to get a better idea of the characteristics of some of the less-commonly-seen
  letter-types. Could you direct me to some fonts that exemplify the difference between:\r\n\r\n*
  a \"Textura\"\r\n* a \"Gotisch\"\r\n* a \"Fraktur\"\r\n* a \"Bastarda\"\r\n* a \"Schwabacher\"\r\n*
  a \"Rotunda\"\r\n* (bonus) an \"Uncial\"\r\n\r\nI'm becoming mildly fascinated with
  faces that use non-Latin letterforms, particularly if they have some historical
  usage precedence. I know there must be lots of research and documentation out there
  about this. Can you give me half-a-dozen things to look at so I can start to see
  the distinctions?\r\n\r\n(Some things that tempted me down this rabbit-hole: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/delve/rieven-uncial|Rieven
  Uncial]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/dark-angel|Dark Angel]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mason-ot|Mason]].
  What the hell is Mason?!?)"

  body: "Well, it only took nearly two years.\r\n\r\nI still wonder, though, whether
    there's an on-line resource where I can at least see a \"family tree\" of names
    of styles within the \"Latin script writing system genres\". Other than Wikipedia,
    which I didn't find helpful.\r\n\r\nI just came across something called \"Lombardic\"
    for example, and a search on Identifont and MyFonts turns up a variety of Lombardic-y
    caps married with fraktur lowercase, uncial lowercase, what-have-you. I take it
    that that's an artifact of the whole upper/lower case thing being a relatively
    recent development.\r\n\r\nA search on \"bastarda\" turns up enough of a variety
    of results that I can't tell which aspects are hallmarks of the genre and which
    are artifacts of trying to cram these historical styles into modern-day conceptions
    of alphabets.\r\n\r\nIf books it is, books it is. They look like excellent books."

  body: "Since Googling \"bastarda\" turns up, for you, a bunch of modern typefaces
    without context, a book on the history of typography would definitely help you
    to achieve an organized understanding, since one of the first things you would
    find in one is historical examples of the various categories of typeface.\r\n\r\nUpdike's
    Printing Types is available for free download, and it's not a bad place to start.\r\n\r\nAnatomy
    of a Typeface by Alexander Lawson, and An Atlas of Typefaces, by James Sutton
    and Alan Bertram (which was recently reprinted, and the reprint was remaindered,
    so copies should be inexpensively available) are additional helpful references."

  body: "Wow, okay, Updike's book is amazing. I can't claim that my understanding
    is better and more neatly categorized. But it's certainly <em>deeper</em>. Categorization
    may (or may not) happen as I view more and more of the typefaces I see with this
    new (and as yet incomplete) understanding.\r\n\r\nFraktur Mon Amor is on my wish-list
    now.\r\n\r\nI still want to know where the hell we got Mason (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mason-ot/)
    from. I think I can start to see the history of Andron 2 (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-2/
    ,  which I find increasingly charming), though.\r\n\r\nY'all are awesome."

    or L'Elf Noir du Mal or Celtic Garamond the 2nd - posters for horror movies followed
    by lettering styles evocative of the Goth look.\r\n\r\nSo one mixes in alchemical
    and religious symbols with the forms of the alphabet."
