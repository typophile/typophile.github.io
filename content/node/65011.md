  body: "If it's a wordmark and the rectangle is part of it, the type is too small.\r\nGenerally
    I think that logos with straight type in simple geometric shapes are underwhelming,
    however nicely set and coloured."

  body: All, Many thanks for verifying the readability. It seemed a fairly obvious
    read to me, but you never can tell. Thanks for the input Nick, I agree with your
    point. The wordmark would not be contained in this shape, I was just trying to
    get an approximate weight of the colours I was working with for the future Identity.

  body: Ha! That's a great post Nick. Actually, it may not be so clear from the jpg
    I uploaded, but I set this in Akkurat, not Helvetica.

  body: I see "39 degrees north" as well, but that should be an uppercase /n/ if you
    are to follow an established notation. Otherwise /n/ looks odd. Readable, but
    odd.

    me, this reads \"n\xB039\" backwards (i.e., \"number 39\")."

  body: Progressing slightly. What do you feel is working better? As to Christopher's
    question - this may become a wordmark for a creative studio who deal with fashion,
    tv, pr and ad agencies.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/39_WIP_6464.jpg]

  body: Is the underscore supposed to represent a blinking cursor? If so, you need
    to use a monospaced font. Otherwise, a vertical bar would be needed for the cursor.

  body: "@ markduk: Can you explain the meaning behind the words \"39\xB0 north?\"
    Regardless if it's a letter (n,N) or word (north, North), why were these words
    chosen? For example, \"That's where their office is located.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the underscore, if the clients are fashion, TV, PR and ad agencies, then I would
    consider the underscore to be inappropriate as it is an obvious digital reference
    and speaks more to software and high tech.\r\n\r\nThe custom \"t\" in (n)North
    is a nice touch should you choose to stay with the full word."
