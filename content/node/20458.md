  body: "This is probably custom, it seems to be inspired by the Coca Cola logo. \r\n\r\nEDIT:

  body: "Ive seen pretty similar lettering, recently, and loved it, is this from 'Smirnoff'
    vodka bottles? Id vote for custom type, as well. <em>( You may still want to consider
    some of the lovely script faces recently released by <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com\"

    usually like scripts but that one looks tasty. OT has really bought scripts to
