  hard drive crash I have lost the original copy (which included the font name).\r\n\r\nI've
  tried a few automatic picture match sites by splitting the logo up into the only
  3 letters I have which are W 3 L.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help identify it?\r\n\r\nhttp://w3lwrestling.com/images/w3l-logo-l.png\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBlaine"
