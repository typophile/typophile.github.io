  body: "Thanks that's close.. but I want the uppercase letters! :D\r\n\r\nI believe
    it's a typeface because these two are from totally different LPs and labels..
    but I'm not sure if it exists as a computer font.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone know the
    type foundry that did this font? or can help me out to start my research? Any
    other good font forums out there? Any sites or books on 70s typefaces? Any persons
    I can contact?\r\n\r\nAnyone seen this font being used other places?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
    again..\r\n\r\n-pookey"

  body: If either of those are fonts - and I would agree that they are surely hand
    drawn - then they would be found amongst the freebies (try DaFont.com). I see
    nothing to suggest that both use the same "font". They only have the pointed tops/bottoms
    in common and that is simply a style -- ala Fette Fraktur, Bradley, Becker and
    others.
