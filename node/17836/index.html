  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="http://typophile.com/node/17535">Frank Jonen&rsquo;s recent topic</a> on text rendering in Quark 7 sparked some discussion about various antialiasing methods. It was noticed that subpixel antialiasing appeared to be disabled in Quark and Pages even when it was on systemwide. There has been some discussion and speculation about this elsewhere culminating in <a href="http://www.michelf.com/weblog/2006/subpixel-antialiasing-achilles-heel/">an explanation by developer Michel Fortin</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, you can&rsquo;t have subpixel anti-aliased text when it&rsquo;s on a transparent layer and you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s going to be composited against. At least not without a performance hit. Graphics applications typically displaying their text in such a context which is why they fall back to pixel-level anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>I would suspect this would also be true with ClearType on Windows. Is it?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical of the explanation. You always antialias to the background, if you don&rsquo;t you get some nasty haloing etc., obviously this requires more processing than assuming you&rsquo;re antialiasing to a solid background - but I&rsquo;m not sure that the rasterizer has a  mode where it assumes this. The engineers report that ClearType rendering is a bit slower than regular antialiasing but not that much slower. The only time I notice perf problems is when the text is displayed against an animated background, due to the constant redraw when the background changes.</p>
<p>Any how I&rsquo;ll direct the engineers to this thread and hopefully they can chime in WRT ClearType.</p>
<p>Edit - comment from the lead ClearType engineer&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a system point of view we keep the alpha channel and then blend that with the active foreground/background.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I probably should point out that I intentionally disabled the full color anti-aliasing on Panther, which is where the screenshot was made. It just wasn&rsquo;t good enough on Panther, better on Tiger but still not there for reading large amounts of text.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know what Quark uses but it was close enough to Pages that it could just be ATSUI.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t anti-alias to the background but the rendering is done separately of the rest of the screen imaging, it must be done on the graphics board&rsquo;s DSP/GPU directly since you&rsquo;ll need more than 8bit per channel to do this in a way that&rsquo;s presentable. At least that&rsquo;s what I noticed when rendering outlines to pixels (no, not in Photoshop).</p>
<p>aRGB seems odd to me, it would imply that the Alpha channel is rendered <em>first</em> then the rest. In theory it wouldn&rsquo;t make much of a difference if you fill a mask or if you cut with a mask. In theory… might be just a typo.</p>
<p>So anti-aliasing to the background makes sense on Windows XP as you never know what kind of graphics board your software might end up on.</p>
<p>At what bit-depth does ClearType operate internally? - Or ATSUI (color) for that matter?</p>
<p>I can only guess about both as the fringing types look similar given that the objective for ClearType is sharpness and of ATSUI it is for longer reading. While the CT approach is better for the type designer, I&rsquo;ll always look at it from the view of a type user.</p>
<p>To the MichelFortin issue with Pages: I think once Apple stops supporting Panther and earlier versions this won&rsquo;t be an issue anymore. You can simply hand-off your rendering operations directly to the GPU with CoreImage.</p>
