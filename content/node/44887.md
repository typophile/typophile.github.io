body: "If I wanted to design a set of ornamental capitals based on an existing typeface.
  Would I be allowed to distribute (sell) that as a typeface?\r\nI once read that
  the name of a typeface may be even more protected then the actual letter forms.
  Assuming it would be allowed to distribute the work, would it also be allowed to
  advertise it as \"A set of ornamental capitals for Bembo\xAE\"?"

    on.\" For example, starting with the outlines of a digital Bembo and modifying
    them, vs drawing them from scratch.\r\n\r\nYou could also simply contact Monotype
    and ask if they mind.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
