    about leaving the past behind: Apple's decisions to dump its \"superior\" classic
    OS and its \"superior\" Motorola architecture has turned the two Macs I purchased
    into high-priced junk, whereas my 12-year-old Pentium II runs Apache server like
    a charm..."

    it's designed nicely. On the downside: there is hardly any customization ever,
    in terms of performance, their products are usually not on the high end, their
    products become obsolete extremely quickly, and to top it off, they charge more
    for their basic stuff compared to high-end companies. All their shit is proprietary.
    New phone? New charger. Want to project with your laptop? Gotta buy an Apple-branded
    adapter. Why not use industry-standard mini-USB? Or HDMI/DVI?\r\n\r\nThey're making
    this whole deal like \"Flash crashes Macs\" and \"Flash is outdated.\" The only
    reason Apple isn't supporting Flash is because, by doing so, they will sell wayyyy
    less Apps in the AppStore, thus losing tons more money. I, personally, hardly
    ever see Flash crash so I don't know where they got that. And the whole deal with
    \"Adobe being close-sourced\" and \"hard to deal with\"? HAH! Every company that
    has ever worked with Apple says they're a nightmare. Close-sourced? Look at yourselves.
    You sued a company that was putting MacOS on non-Apple-branded hardware for no
    reason, other than you may have been losing (very little) money. Great job.\r\n\r\nJon
    Stewart does a nice commentary:\r\nhttp://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-april-28-2010/appholes\r\n\r\nBUT,
    on the positive: their computers look beautiful. :)"

    will sell wayyyy less Apps in the AppStore\"\r\n\r\nApple seems to be taking a
    brunt of the blame in this 'debate'. I think it's rather telling that it wasn't
    until this past release of CS5 that Adobe made native Cocoa apps. \r\n\r\nApple
    is a forward thinking company and I'd agree with Steve that if you rely on the
    3rd party IDEs, your developers will always be several steps behind what Apple
    is doing. At that point, you'd not differentiating your platform very well (which
    has always been Apple's primary business model).\r\n\r\nDoes that piss of a chunk
    of developers out there who like the idea of right once deploy in multiple devices?
    Absolutely. But there are so many dedicated Apple developers that I think they're
    not too worried about that. \r\n\r\n\"I, personally, hardly ever see Flash crash
    so I don't know where they got that.\"\r\n\r\nThey get it from more than one person's
    first-hand personal experiences.\r\n\r\n\"other than you may have been losing
    (very little) money\"\r\n\r\nAgain, they want to fully manage and preserve the
    user experience. I think there's room for arguments of anti-competitiveness, for
    sure, but from a basic user experience POV, Apple isn't stupid. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"But there are so many dedicated Apple developers that I think they're not
    too worried about that.\"\r\n\r\nDedicated software developers to one operating
    system or one mode of thinking/processing defeats the purpose of market diversity.
    The reason Microsoft and Adobe are so successful is because they make room for
    variability and work with programs/developers. Apple says here are the rules,
    and it can only be done the way we want. In the end, this sucks for developers/users
    because you're forced into the hole that the company puts you in.\r\n\r\n\"They
    get it from more than one person's first-hand personal experiences.\"\r\n\r\nI'm
    speaking from more than just one person's experiences. I've seen MacOS crash tons
    of times but never because of flash. This has been discussed widely where I am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"preserve
    the user experience\"\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that those who bought their computers
    not from Apple but with MacOS on it did it for that very reason: they didn't want
    to have Apple controlling every aspect of how they interact/use the product for
    which they are paying. The Macbooks are completely overpriced and aren't even
    close to being up-to-date. They're pretty and function well (besides tons of failing
    hard drives) but they don't even offer quad-core, which for the same price of
    their basic Macbook you can get a workhorse with Win7 installed (which is just
    as wonderful an OS as SnowLeopard, if not better for workflow.)"
