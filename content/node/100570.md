  body: "> Can you give me some ideas please\r\n\r\nKyle, you might want to consider
    hiring a professional graphic designer to develop your logo, stationery, website,
    signage and marketing materials. It would be money well spent. \r\n\r\nBut if
    you're looking for an idea for your existing concept, one approach would be to
    make the house icon large and put the type inside of it.\r\n"
