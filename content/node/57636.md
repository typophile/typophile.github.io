  body: "We have gotten questions before about these kinds of Dot fonts, but I just
    failed to find any of the threads with a Google search of the site. Maybe someone
    else remembers? (My recollection is that there is an old film font like this,
    but I also think there is a new revival, or something similar, in digital form.
    I seem to remember that certain letters were not the same in all versions.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/studiocharlie/superpois/|Superpois]] is similar,
    but the letterforms are more condensed and have some different forms than the
    sample (G for example).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
