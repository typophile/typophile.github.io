  attached sample. (The raised appearance and the option of using two colours (in
  this case the raised gold border and enamel) are of particular interest). \r\n\r\nRealize
  the sample photo itself is a hand carved 'one off'  but any suggestions for  commercially
  available fonts in a similar vein please?\r\n\r\nthanks as always for the input
  and best wishes\r\n\r\nSteve"
