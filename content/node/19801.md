  I''m working on. I''ve looked through the Flickr group here: http://www.flickr.com/groups/type_specimen/
  but I''m really interested in more contemporary designs, not just showing the character
  set or Lorem ipsum. Typefaces don''t matter I''m just looking for the variety and
  different techniques (phrases vs. single words per line vs. story telling).'

  body: Hmmm, I'm obsessed with type specimens. I collect them PDFs (along with scans
    and photographs) and print them all out on the laser. I think that the best place
    to get them is to download them directly from the foundry's/type designer's website.
    My <a href="http://del.icio.us/geoffriding/typefoundry">del.icio.us/typefoundry</a>
    tag if you need links to their websites. I hope this helps.

  body: "Geoff: I'll take a look at that link!\r\n\r\nStephen: GIFs are fine as long
    as they're decent size. Like I said I'm just looking at styles/techniques and
    formatting. What I'm really looking for is more extensive samples like Mark has
    on his website ie. http://ms-studio.com/FontSales/goldenbook.html . I know I've
    seen them before but just can't remember/find examples. Thanks!"

    you might like to check it out, see <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EmigreCatalog.php\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nMost
    foundries do have PDF specimens available for download, just look for that elusive
    little icon or text that says PDF. :^)"
