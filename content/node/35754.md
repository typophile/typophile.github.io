    is sort of like this, but the B is not as much like the one in the sample. Is
    that the one you were thinking of?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Naw. Maybe I'm just imagining things. We'll only know when this gets identified
    -- if it ever does, because for all it's worth this could be a custom designed
    logo.

    not nailed it. Bald  may be right, it could be custom.\r\n\r\nThanks again for
    all the help and then some."

  body: "I immediately thought Blambot when I saw it. I think Ignacio hit it dead
    on.\r\n\r\nEdit: I made a side-by-side comparison (see below). There are definitely
    variations, but I wouldn't put it past someone to make their own modifications.
    The lc o seems to have been flipped, other corners have been rounded, and there
    are some other differences, but I'm still willing to bet Workingman Extended was
    the origin.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodytech_6418.jpg]\r\n\r\nSide
    note: when I went to type in the sample text, I typed in \"BodyText\" by accident.
    Guess that's why I'm a graphic designer and not a muscleman."
