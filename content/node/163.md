  body: I think actually spotted the typeface you&#39;re looking for. I only saw it
    for a second but it was used for the logo/title of TLC&#39;s tv show, &#39;For
    Better or for Worse.&#39; <BR> <BR><a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/tuneins/forbetterorworse"

    no picures of it are on the web yet--I guess the show isn&#39;t very popular.&#41;
