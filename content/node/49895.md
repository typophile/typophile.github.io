  body: "I created this with Cochin... Just added a small stroke to it. Looks like
    they may have modified the bar in the R to lose the curve. But perhaps it just
    becomes less distinguishable at low-res.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/COCHIN_4665.jpg]\r\n\r\nSerif
    brackets look a little different as well. They look heavier in your image."
