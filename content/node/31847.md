  body: satya - I did not say it was the same, I was just thinking that there are
    typefaces close enough to this sample to suggest that it might not be a MM replacement.

  body: "oh, I didn't read your reply properly, sorry. :)\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy
    question.\r\n\r\nI don't understand, whats the point of having such similar typefaces
    which already exists(ya there are difference but negligible). \r\nIs it really
    Ok to design a similar typeface with an existing face??\r\nNow look at this typeface
    only, it resembles with these many typefaces...More similar faces creates confusion,
    nothing else.\r\n\r\ndunno, just a thought...any reactions??\r\n"

    'R's leg stroke to the middle of the bowl.
