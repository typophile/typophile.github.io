body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have been drawing sketches of typefaces for a long time and I
  would like to learn to turn my ideas into digital fonts. I currently own a laptop
  running Ubuntu. I haven't searched seriously, but I doubt there a lot of interesting
  tools for typographical design on Linux. (Prove me wrong if you wish!)\r\n\r\nSo
  I am considering getting a new mac. My question is this: what components of the
  computer should I consider for the specific task of designing typography? For example,
  \r\n\r\n- Does designing a typeface on a laptop somehow affects the working habits
  of a designer? \r\n- Is a large screen essential to perform this task? Can you get
  away with a 15\" or 12\" screen?\r\n- Are the type-design softwares typically hungry
  for RAM or processor speed?\r\n\r\nSo basically, I am asking for advice to put together
  a nice and effective workstation for type design. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCh.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Christian, I just upgraded to a Mac Book Pro laptop. But I use it more as
    a desktop machine. Meaning it mostly stays plugged into a large monitor and USB
    keyboard, plus a speaker system and ethernet. When I want to get away, I just
    unplug and go. It's the best of both worlds.

    habits. I'm a laptop user for lyfe because I spend most of my waking hours on
    the computer and like to have the freedom to move around.\r\n\r\n- I use a 15\"
    macbook. I have a large dual monitor setup but rarely use it for type design work.\r\n\r\n-
    My macbook only has 512mb of RAM right now and it's perfectly fine for running
    the 2 programs I use - illustrator and fontlab studio.\r\n\r\nIf you do get a
    mac for the love of all things holy, GET THE 3 YEAR APPLECARE!\r\n"

    like no matter what kind of design I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s just a lot easier
    on a big, hi-res screen.\r\n\r\nAs far as performance goes, none of the popular
    font applications need too much RAM, and with all of Apple\u2019s systems selling
    with at least a gigabyte of RAM, so you should be fine there. Of course, if you
    want to simultaneously rock out in Indesign and Photoshop, you might want more.
    \r\n\r\nIf you already have a good external monitor there\u2019s no reason that
    the $600 Mac Mini won\u2019t be all you need."

    the screen size. I hadn't thought about the Mac Mini at all.\r\n\r\nChristian\r\n\r\nPS:
    Is there a directory of classic Typophile threads somewhere? I have stumbled on
    the FAQ for posting guidelines, but I was wondering if there is a shortcut to
    frequently asked subjects or highly informative threads, apart from the search
    box above.\r\n\r\n "

    \r\n\r\nNote that once you get a laptop, it's REALLY hard to go back to a desktop.
    ;o)\r\n\r\nPersonally, my view on laptops these days is to go cheap and upgrade
    more frequently. I used to have a TiBook and 'upgraded' to a Plain-Jane Macbook
    for half the price 2 years later. "

    \r\n\r\nI very much like having a wide screen to do type design on, so that I
    can have lots of windows open in FontLab. It is also good for previews, and I
    and can rotate it to portrait orientation for really big previews. I also have
    a smaller screen with the tools on it and a text file open. "
