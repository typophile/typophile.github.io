  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm a graphic designer who works in a Portuguese publishing company specialised in children's books. <BR> <BR>My question is: <BR>How many of you consider it is correct to use ligatures (like fi or fl) in these kind of books ? <BR> <BR>The point is: <BR>I want to set beatiful and typographically (more) &quot;correct&quot; layouts, making good use of the features I have available. However, I don't want to confuse young readers who are still developing their reading skills. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for your time &amp; opinions <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are different classes of ligatures, and aesthetically the only ones that really makes sense to me are the ones that fix problems: like the beak of the &quot;f&quot; touching the dot of the &quot;i&quot;. The other ones (like &quot;ct&quot;) are usually too decorative. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I feel that ligatures have an abscure functional advantage: they diverge boumas*. But it's very hard to use them properly in this manner, and the gain is admittedly small. <BR> <BR>* <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>In the functional realm, it's worth pointing out that children only start reading boumas around the age of 9. So if the books are for younger kids, there's a very good reason <i>not</i> to use ligatures: individual letters have to be highly decipherable, so the dot of the &quot;i&quot; can be very important for example. Choose a font where the &quot;f&quot;-&quot;i&quot; sequence sets well by default - that usually means a shy lc &quot;f&quot;, but&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would have to say that it depends on the level of the book. If the reading is going to be done on the sentence level the kids are old enough to undestand a ligature. If the book is quite short, where reading is done on a per-letter basis, i.e. b-a-l-l, than I would deffinately skip the ligature. <BR> <BR>As I understand it good typography is about readability. Ligatures aid that by clarifying places in a word where the combination of letterforms is awkeward. Everyone likes that. And I can imagine as a kid ligatures would seem fancy and interesting.  <BR> <BR>As a father I would appreciate any addition of quality and sophistication to my childrens books. I believe that they will adapt to any level of sophistication they are presented with. For me ligatures are a go</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While I appreciate John's comment. I would have to say that you shouldn't use ligatures. Children, especially those learning to read, are also developing writing skills. I would think that ligatures would introduce confusion. At that level it would be difficult to depend upon conformity in the typography of the books they are reading.  <BR> <BR>It is also important, I think, to keep dyslexia in mind. Those children already struggle with this disorder. It could be especially damaging for them.</div>

I know, 'cause I've been trying since my pre-teen years. When I moved back to Beirut after living in Palo Alto for 2.5 years, I tried to introduce &quot;moron&quot; to my classmates. I think like three of them were using it profusely by the following year. But &quot;bouma&quot; is much harder, because you never hear it on TV, plus the target group is adults. The advantage is that the concept itself is pretty old by now - even though it's never been explained properly, at least not in the context of typography. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I think there are now almost a dozen people who use it without quotes or italics or anything, which is great. And it's possible they've passed it on to people who haven't been in my &quot;vicinity&quot; - who knows? Like this was pretty &quot;unprovoked&quot;: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7060.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7060.html">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7060.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>But really, it's not a matter of vanity, &quot;bouma&quot; is much better than the only alternative, &quot;word gestalt&quot;, which: <BR>1) Sound like a German lobotomy clinic; <BR>2) Is too long; <BR>3) Is misleading: we don't read words, we read letter-clusters. The space is certainly the strongest delimiter, but the longer the word the less a bouma is a word. <BR> <BR>I simply like the term &quot;bouma&quot; (which I didn't invent - it's a simplification of &quot;Bouma-shape&quot;, which is used by at least two &quot;real&quot; scholars) simply because it's an elegant and effective <i>solution</i> to talking about this stuff. <BR> <BR>I should do really some Google exploration and see what I can dig up&hellip; <BR>Here's something: <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/readability.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/readability.html">http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/readability.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>And if I remember correctly, you've used the term yourself!  :-) <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; this new religion <BR> <BR>? <BR>It's just part of good craftsmanship. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I think understanding of reading has advanced considerably in the past hundred years or so, but it is not complete, and one of the areas that we still don't fully understand is exactly <i>how</i> we recognise these clusters of letters. I'm not aware of evidence that eradicates the possibility that we are assimilating multiple data <i>including the sub-pattern of individual letters within the larger pattern of the cluster.</i> I don't think there are grounds to over-promote the 'nebulous' by forcibly demoting individual letters beyond consideration. The 'legacy misconception' is that we read by moving from letter to letter; this is clearly bunkum and has been known to be false for a long time, but recognising this misconception is not the same thing as saying that individual letters do not contribute to the recognition of, ahem, bouma-shapes. Obviously individual letters <i>do</i> contribute to this recognition, because they define the overall bouma-shape, but I don't think we know enough, yet, about how this recognition takes place.</div>

Bunches of people have concluded this. <BR> <BR>So for example Larson's mistake -I presume- is to assume that ClearType text is fully immersive, and that throws eveything off, in many ways. <BR> <BR>&gt; forcibly demoting individual letters beyond consideration. <BR> <BR>You're right - not beyond consideration. In fact when you run into a brand new word, your resort to letter compilation. But that's rare. And really, the best reason not to compile letters into words is good old-fashioned efficiency: letter distribution is not flat, and frequent groups of letters greatly reduce the overall recognition time of a text, because things proceed in clumps. Even in the hi-res fovea, boumas are used primarily, simply because it's much faster. The brain is a quick and dirty little devil. <BR> <BR>The basic valuable conclusion of the bouma model is that legibility of individual letters and readability of real texts are somewhat opposed. Not totally opposed of course, but think of it as vectors 90 degrees apart. So a letter that is too much itself is bad for reading, and a letter that easily decomposes into components -in the low-frequency (blurry) layer of perception-, for example thanks to stroke contrast, is good for reading. This is a core reason why some studies have found that sans fonts are more &quot;legible&quot;, while others have found the opposite. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Bunches of people have concluded this. </i> <BR> <BR>Well, 'not more than half the time' is a heck of a lot more that I thought you were giving individual letters credit for. Consider, though, your own examples of readability in para-foveal vision on your website: apart from the very obvious benefit of clear ascenders, there are evident benefits of certain letterforms within the bouma-shapes that limit fixations and regressions. The lowercase k in your images seems to me a good example of this. In order to say that a bouma-shape in one typeface is more readable than a bouma-shape in another typefaces is necessarily to say that individual letterforms have a profound impact on bouma-shape recognition. <BR> <BR>I'm not debating legibility vs. readability; I largely agree with you on that front. I'm saying that individual letterforms provide the underlying sub-patterns of all bouma shapes, and this needs to be incorporated into a useful description of reading. There is a very simplistic and reductionist view that says bouma-shapes are recognised by their 'outline', but the examples on your own website clearly show the importance of internal shapes and space within the bouma-shape. When multiple data are contributing to pattern recognition in a complex way, I don't think it is a good idea to talk about 'demoting' the importance of a particular kind of datum, even if the intent is to correct an historical conceptual imbalance, albeit one to which almost no one still holds. Why not simply try to be accurate and, when necessary, acknowledge the incompleteness of our description of reading and, hence, the uncertainty of our practical responses? I'm not advocating paralysis: there is still a lot we can learn from the description and apply to type design.</div>

There was a method which prefered to teach reading by shadowed words, or something like that, opposed to the old one which basically teached syllabs one after another to make words. The &quot;new&quot; method was interesting in the fact it permitted children to read some things (their name, usual things as &quot;mother&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, certainly different scripts have different degrees to which they support the move from the decipherment of elemental shapes to the decipherment of groups of shapes (and the use of the parafovea) as a person is learning to read, but the tendency of the human brain to process information as quickly as possible is universal. Getting used to patterns in written language (frequent groupings of letters), and using as much of the information available as possible (through the entire retina, not just the fovea) happens naturally for any normal person. <BR> <BR>It would be very interesting to compare English and German for example.

		<div class="commentbody">I base my view &ndash; that the majority of reading, in the sense of cognitive processing of perceptual elements (as opposed to the wider sense that includes liminal recognition of peripheral cues, regression, etc.), takes place in foveal vision &ndash; on what studies indicate about the phenomenon of lateral masking. This is the phenomenon by which adjacent shapes in parafoveal vision actually <i>distort</i> perception of each other: note, not blur each other, as the illustrations on your website suggest, but distort. This distortion, because it is the result of interaction between letters, is present not at the individual letter recognition level <i>but at the bouma-shape level</i>. The lateral masking of adjacent letters in parafoveal vision results in radically underdetermined bouma-shapes, with no recourse to internal details because it is the distortion of these details that is affecting the bouma-shape as a whole. <BR> <BR>That said &ndash; but without undermining the view that <i>most</i> cognitive processing during reading involves perception in foveal vision &ndash; the quality of cues available in parafoveal vision <i>are</i> affected by type design, which can certainly make it harder or easier to anticipate fixations. Mansfield, Legge and Ortiz (University of Minnesota) published an interesting study in which they addressed the 'paradox' of lateral masking: the fact that lone letters in parafoveal vision, without flanking letters, are easily recognised, but strings of letters become unrecognisable either as individual letters or as groups of letters. They measured the phenomenon of lateral masking as the space between shapes with and without 'joining flanks' was reduced, with some interesting implications re. the usefulness of serifs. Lateral masking is released when shapes with 'joining flanks' get so close enough to form a single figure. In other words, letters with 'joining flanks', e.g. serifs, are more likely to release lateral masking and form recognisable letter clusters, but note the central implication of all this: bouma-shapes are <i>built up</i> from individual letters, whose form and interaction determine the recognisability of the bouma-shape. <BR> <BR>This is the conclusion of the Mansfield, Legge and Ortiz paper, with direct implications for your 'nebulous' reading concept: <i>A 'blurring' explanation cannot account for the release of masking when the flanks and target form a single figure. Our finding suggests that lateral masking occurs only after figural segmentation.</i></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Lateral masking (LM) is difficult to grasp. I have to admit that it's one of the two big holes remaining in my understanding of reading*. On the other hand, what I do undestand about it indicates that it doesn't <i>dessimate</i> parafoveal information the way you seem to be implying. Three things: <BR>1) LM doesn't affect <i>all</i> shape-adjacencies, just certain ones where curves and straights are in certain configurations. <BR>2) As far as I understand, even foveal vision isn't immune to LM. <BR>3) Without any empirical measurements of saccade length versus foveal span, you could plausibly use LM to think what you do. But the empirical measurements are in fact there to give credence to the view that the parafovea is the major player - the evidence is where the idea comes from, to me. How could saccades span three times more text than the fovea can see while enabling us to still read? Again: what kind of data from the parafovea can provide such a good location to saccade to next, while not providing significant usable textual information, especially in such a wide span? <BR> <BR>* The other -actually the much bigger one- is something that <i>nobody</i> seems to understand yet (and I'm not holding my breath that it'll happen in my lifetime): how the brain maps a shape to a concept. <BR> <BR>&gt; strings of letters become unrecognisable <BR> <BR>But other experiments have shown otherwise. Who do you choose to believe? Not any single researcher, but the &quot;converging&quot; model. <BR> <BR>And actually, reading the rest of your elaboration makes me think that the UoM researchers* validate the bouma model! You can't single out <i>individual</i> letters in the parafovea, but when multiple letters cluster together they form a nice big shape (that also happens to be more efficient for reading). And serifs are very interesting: my view is that they help readability in effect because they hinder legibility!  :-/ <BR> <BR>* Whose work I think I have a copy of, but haven't read yet - I have yet to muster the forces to climb the LM mountain. :-)  BTW, you might also check out this: &quot;Enhancing the perception of form in peripheral vision&quot; by G Geiger and J Y Lettvin, '85 - it contains some very interesting LM research. <BR> <BR>Also, the issue might very well be that they were measuring deliberative decipherment but in the parafovea (not the fovea where it happens naturally), and that's not something that happens in normal reading: you don't stare at a point and try to figure out what's a few centimeters to the right of it! Where consciousness fails -by worrying too much about absolute recognition- the subconscious might very well say: Who cares if I'm not sure? It's close enough - let's just assume the most probable case based on the semantic context of the actual phrase, and move on, and if we were wrong, we'll regress (which in fact does happen). Speaking of regressions: they could only happen if reading is in fact a &quot;lossy&quot; process. <BR> <BR>As for merely blurring, yes, it is indeed naive - it's just a start, and I hope to have subsequent pages on my site to delve deeper. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In relation to the side-thread here about perceptual processing in reading, shouldn't the question be: what happens where, and when? rather than who is the 'major player', or where does the majority of reading take place. Specifically, in the context of what Hrant refers to as boumas, since by definition bouma shapes include information about shapes internal to an aggregate of letters we process as a unit, as well as information about the envelope, the question is, is information about internal shapes accessible to the  parafoeveal processing mechanisms used in immersive reading or is it masked there. Empirical evidence from at least one of Hrant's sources suggest that when there is discrimination up to the bouma-shape level, 97.3% of words in an essay length text are uniquely identifiable! Does the way the parafovea is used in reading include discrimination to that level? Or does such a level of discrimination only happen during fixations, triggering word recognition, and the expansion of the zone of perceived acuity? <BR> <BR>pe</div>

But in the absense of such depth of understanding, we could still try to extract some usefulness out of what we do know. The nature of the balance between letter-wise and bouma decipherment (which I feel can be gleaned with what we already know) does affect type design, for example in the determination of x-heights: if letter-wise is the main player, why not make x-heights as large a possible (without for example making the &quot;h&quot; look too much like an &quot;n&quot;)? <BR> <BR>&gt; what Hrant refers to as boumas <BR> <BR>Hey, you call them &quot;bouma&quot;s when we talk in private!  :-) <BR> <BR>&gt; is information about internal shapes accessible to the parafoeveal processing mechanisms used in immersive reading or is it masked there <BR> <BR>Whether it's masked or not, most of the parafovea is inherently too blurry to convey the jumbled internal details.

		<div class="commentbody">Can &quot;children&quot; handle ligatures? I suppose it depends on the age and experience of the child. It also depends on the book itself. Some books are meant to specifically teach reading skills, others are intended for parents to read to their kids. Children range from 0-17 years, but I'll assume you're talking about young children.  <BR> <BR>Personally, my parents bought me books from all over the world when I was a child. Many were set in both english and another language. Usually these books used ligatures and they were even more magical because the typography was special. In fact, I credit my current passion for type and design from my early inspiration from these &quot;children's books.&quot;  <BR> <BR>My point is this: children's books are very important, and grown-ups shouldn't underestimate the readers of these books. Do you really think a five-year old will be harmed by an &quot;fi&quot; ligature? This doesn't mean you should incorporate every possible ligature, but if it really increases legibility, it will most likely go unnoticed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In relation to the original question for this forum, I would guess that for readers who have mastered the writing, recognition, naming and orthographic assembly of a particular alphabet's placeholders (letters), the curve for gaining familiarity and readerly comfort with ligatures is quite shallow. As a child I delighted in such clever concoctions. <BR> <BR>That, for many types, ligatures assist in guaranteeing the rhythmic cohesiveness of the orthographic clusters the letters help form is clear.  <BR> <BR>Our perception of whether ligatures have a long-term perceptual processing benefit for immersive reading might or might not depend on how divergences in opinion about the mechanics of perceptual processing in reading  &ndash; such as the ones one senses in the above &ndash; get resolved. I for one do not see a ready-to-hand answer emerging from what I think I understand about the process, and as a result feel hesitant about subverting this forum to that end. Perhaps the Mansfield, Legge and Ortiz material John Hudson cites can provide an oblique clue. <BR> <BR>The Hrant source I referred to in my earlier post is Chapter 9 &quot;Letter and Word Recognition&quot; of Taylor &amp; Taylor's <em>The Psychology of Reading</em>. <BR> <BR>I use the term bouma because I like the emphasis it places on the word as a *perceptual* entity defined by more than just its 'envelope'and parts; this rather than as an orthographic cluster, whose identity as a word presumes a subattentive cognitive assembly process every time it is encountered. I see a similar emphasis in Gerrit Noordzij's talk about the word image and word-blindness. (Of course the word is more than that, but that is the side of it the type-designer cares about most) Most studies of reading I have consulted don't take this dimension into account when they frame their investigative strategies and draw their conclusions. This is why  so much of what is surmissed here is based on extrapolation (of which I think Hrant's #3 in post  2582 is a misfired example). I don't necessarily think my formulation or the term states well enough what is at stake here, but they go a ways.   <BR> <BR>pe</div>

I think the problem here is that you are raising points (length of saccade, outside-in shape recognition) that support your view &ndash; and I acknowledge that they support your view &ndash; and I am raising points (lateral masking, insufficiency of envelope, importance of sub-patterns to bouma-shape recognition) that, at least, suggest that your view is simplistic and far from complete. I don't think you are wrong; in fact, I still think we agree on more than disagree about. You've repeatedly stated that you are interested in what is useful, specifically what is useful to type design, and I share this interest. Increasingly, it seems to me that the usefulness of the envelope stops somewhere around 'make sure ascenders are obvious and the x-height isn't too big'. This would be an important and radical insight if we were still living in an age of gigantic x-heights, but how many recent text typefaces suffer from this problem? So I'm interested in the more complex implications for type design that emerge from the acknowledgement that individual letter shape does play a r</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Brian, your DIY testing is interesting. I've learned that on occasion astronomers actually use parafoveal vision consciously (it helps them see flicker in celestial bodies, since the fovea is less sensitive to movement), and one day I hope to explore than personally myself. <BR> <BR>&gt; distortions <BR> <BR>The distorions are complex, sometimes mysterious, and they happen in different realms. In terms of raw acuity (resolution), biological and perceptive tests have revealed that the retina has a small central area of high acuity, beyond which acuity plunges deeply, and then plateaus. Picture a narrow bell curve with the top sheared flat. So in terms of rod/cone &quot;hardware&quot;, the fovea has suberb resolution, while the parafovea starts blurry and gets blurrier. In addition to blurring, there's a strange phenomenon called Lateral Masking which causes certain shape adjacencies to implode, so to speak, reducing decipherability. LM is not very well understood yet, but from what I understand it happens at a higher level than the retina. Lastly, there's the issue of deliberative/conscious versus immersive/subconscious perceptual processing. When you get somebody to focus on a point, and you then ask him to deliberately describe what he sees some distance to the side (usually the right), how accurately does that reflect what happens when we read &quot;naturally&quot;? It can be said -and I would agree- that the amount of information the immersed mind needs to feel satisfied that a bouma has been deciphered is much less than the conscious mind needs to feel like it's answering an explicit decipherment question adequately. <BR> <BR>In terms of empirical findings, Herman Bouma has done tests to measure the acuity of the parafovea (both in the recognition of individual letters as well as the recognition of component letters of [short] words), and a few researchers have done work towards understanding lateral masking. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; insufficiency of envelope <BR>&gt; importance of sub-patterns to bouma-shape recognition <BR> <BR>Could you elaborate on these two? <BR> <BR>&gt; it seems to me that the usefulness of the envelope stops somewhere around 'make sure ascenders are obvious and the x-height isn't too big'. <BR> <BR>That is perhaps the most obvious result of accepting the prominence of boumas, and of course there are no resultant hard numbers one can lean on to make better fonts. <BR> <BR>I would say however that there are other important results too, things like: the importance of tight spacing, the positive role of serifs, etc. The realization that we primarily read the silhouettes (your &quot;envelopes&quot;) of clusters of letters really has deep and multifarious implications. <BR> <BR>Also, I would add that a &quot;culture of understanding&quot; is perhaps the most valuable result of learning something specific like how boumas work. <BR> <BR>&gt; how many recent text typefaces suffer from this problem? <BR> <BR>It's hard to say, since: <BR>1) Readability performance is on a curve - there are no plateaus. There is always a point (although it moves) where an x-height is optimal. <BR>2) Who knows how small an x-height should be? Maybe the average contemporary x-height is indeed too large. I tend to think it is, if not ridiculously so like it used to be. <BR> <BR>But really, more important is that overall &quot;cultural&quot; attitude. It's pretty clear to me that type designers as a whole haven't been taking the technical aspects of the craft seriously enough, perhaps as a result of the &quot;romantic&quot; 90s. This atechnical attitude is contagious, and it permeates type users as well as designers. With more understanding of why boumas for example matter, readers will end up benefiting. <BR> <BR>A specific example that sticks in my mind is Bilak's Eureka, and how it was [mis]used in One (?) magazine. Eureka is a wonderful font in many ways, including a modest x-height, but it's too loose to form good boumas, and this is a direct result of Bilak's announced attempt to make the individual letters more legible*. Now, this looseness could always be largely corrected through negative tracking in the layout app, but of course you'd have to know that's the problem. One magazine soon abandoned Eureka and went with something ultra-conservative (Minion or something). Although I have no proof, I do have a strong suspicion that: they realized its readability was low, but had no idea how to fix it, so they panicked and decided to play it super-safe. All they really needed to do is apply negative tracking - but they didn't know what that really does to a text face. <BR> <BR>* The good news is that his more recent work, like Fedra-Serif, is much more well-rounded - and yet doesn't forsake his wonderful originality. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree profoundly with what you say, Hrant, about a developing 'a culture of understanding', but feel uncomfortable with your negativism about its present prospects. <BR> <BR>I believe the study of perceptual processing in reading should be given disciplinary status within the encyclopedia of the sciences, and that reading in the discipline should be an educational requirement for type-smiths. Even if only to convince us that space-craft (Kindersly) is more than a niceity, it is a percepual processing requirement in texts meant for immersive reading. <BR> <BR>First we will have to get clear about first principles, as this forum demonstrates. <BR> <BR>pe</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; your negativism about its present prospects <BR> <BR>No, I think the <i>prospects</i> are better than they've been in 30 years! :-) But I am indeed negative about where they've been recently, and still largely are. <BR> <BR>Together, we are trying to lift the craft out of this quagmire. Let's see if our arms hold up. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>I guess our main divergence of opinion here concerns the balance of importance of the silhouette (envelope) versus the internal details of a bouma. Larson notwithstanding. <BR> <BR>As happens often enough to keep me online, thanks to this thread (and countless other threads on many forums) as well as some private exchanges, I've clarified my own views on this particular matter, unifying many disparate ideas: <BR> <BR>The retina provides the brain with a great amount of information. Perhaps to manage this overload efficiently, the brain processes this information in layers of frequency: starting with &quot;blurry&quot; low-frequency versions that can be analyzed quickly, and moving to sharper higher frequency versions that take longer. The number of such layers the brain resorts to depends on need. In terms of reading text (composed of horizontal lines of well-defined b&amp;w forms), there may only be two layers of frequency needed: a coarse one that conveys sufficient detail of silhouette, and a sharp one that conveys fully unambiguous data (where individual letters could be -but are generally not- fully deciphered). <BR> <BR>My view is that the low-frequency data is usually adequate to decipher a bouma, considering the rich context of actual language. This view is substantiated by the fact that the parafovea (which cannot convey the higher frequencies that the fovea can, but which is larger) covers most of the reading surface during immersive reading. It is also substantiated by research which has shown that the brain processes shapes &quot;outside-in&quot;. In truth this outside-in business is misleading, because there's really no such &quot;geographic progression&quot;: it's a matter of subsequent processing of increasingly higher-frequency data, where internal details become increasingly clear. However, the level of detail needed to strike a balance in reading between speed and limiting errors is sufficienty expressed in the parafovea, upto ~3 times the span of the fovea. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Append: <BR>And it's not really a matter of parafovea versus fovea, since the latter also conveys the low-frequency data first (because it's processed faster). However, the fovea can convey the higher-frequency version of the data when needed: when the silhouette is not good enough; or when the bouma is unknown and letter-wise decipherment/compilation (the slowest of the slow) becomes unavoidable. Note that in the former case: if the silhouette is in the parafovea it results in a fixation upon it; if it's already in the fovea it means internal details will in the end be needed for adequate decipherment. <BR> <BR>So: <BR>The better the bouma, the less often the higher-frequency layer is <BR>needed, because that translates into greater reading speed/comfort. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

When I have some time over the next couple of days I'll post an explanation of why I believe this high contrast pattern is important and, also, why I think it is not only perceived in immersive reading but is actually unavoidable.</div>
