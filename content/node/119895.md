  body: "The sample isn't large enough or high-res enough for a definitive ID, but
    this looks like a typewriter-style font that someone customized by removing the
    bottom serifs. The following fonts could help you approximate the look:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/glen-jan/leto-slab/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/courier-new/\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the label appears to be set in Futura.\r\n\r\nGlad to know that the designer
    did this as a parody of luxury packaging:\r\nhttp://www.moreytalmor.com/?mtp_page=habit"
