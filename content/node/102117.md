  In the given image you may observe the problem.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Word
  2013 Issue_3869.jpg]\r\nThe first line shows a large single ligature shown correctly
  by Word 2013 but the same ligature does not appear completely at smaller sizes.
  At smaller point size the right side of the ligature do not appear as in the lower
  lines in the above image. But it is a view issue only (not printing issue) and so
  if I zoom in, the same ligature appear correctly. All the the larger ligatures show
  same issue in the otf. The problem appears in otf file only while the ttf is shown
  correctly by Word 2013. The same otf file works correctly in Word 2010 and InDesign
  CS6."
