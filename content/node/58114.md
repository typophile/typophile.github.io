body: "infomaniak means computermaniac in english wich name is not related on their
  services (10 years ago their were fixing PC, so is their name). in french \"maniac\"
  is writtent with a 'c' not a 'k', so i decided on this project to focus on the k
  to get an identity.\r\ni made the first logo based on a Myriad Typeface, wich i
  modified to make it more personal, but i'm asking myself if enven with modifications,
  myriad is so much used, that it's hard with this font to have a personal touch signature
  logo.\r\nSo if you could help me decide in this series wich one is the best, what
  do you like or not.\r\ndont hesitate to be crude if think so, i'm not afraid of
  the dark, and you can learn a lot from critisism.\r\nps. sorry for my bad english.\r\n\r\nfirst
  three have the same typo, just added a logo for project 2 (and a 'trying to be fancy'
  gradiant in 2b)\r\nProject 3 is different typefont."

  body: "I like #3 the best. The Infomaniac part, not the Network. I think it could
    easily work even without a special treatment of m and k as a wordmark.\r\n\r\nThe
    K symbol is nice and memorable. I would however try switch back to regular M and
    slice off the tip of f's ascender instead. I.e. to match the appearance of 'a'."

    the f as you suggested and it's much better, so now\r\nwhat about the m cutted
    \   yes or no ?\r\n\r\nI have to find a font for \"Network\" what do you think
    about helvetica Neue Thin extended ?\r\nlike this\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/infomaniak5_5105.jpg]"

  body: "If it were up to me, I'd drop modified M. \r\n\r\nA couple of more ideas
    if it's not too late - (a) cut the top of the K at the same 45 deg angle (top-left
    to bottom-right) (b) consider using all caps.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the secondary
    font - I'm not convinced it is needed and that the whole logo cannot be done in
    just one family."

    suggestions. All Caps, mmh i don't know\r\nabout that. i will also try all the
    same font, didn't try\r\nthat because i tough it would be too heavy.\r\n\r\nfor
    the all caps, i have to stick a minimum to the current\r\nlogo wich you can see
    at    www.infomaniak.ch\r\nand i love the generous-rounded side of the font\r\nin
    Capital it would be all angle, don't you think?"

    with the same font, i've tried with capitals, it losts all its charm if found.\r\nin
    the top version i have the k cutted like n and m and the original font.\r\nin
    the bottom the k is full cutted and the font is matchning modifications\r\n\r\nIt
    would be nice if i could have opinions of more people, about the k the m the Network
    font\r\ni need inputs, i'm a slow decider and i need to fasten the project as
    much as possible\r\nAll inputs are warmly welcomed."

    i have this old habit,  comming from print usage, to always work the shape before

  body: "Forget about colours for now. Stick to your habits inspite web times these
    days. Logos are still logos and are better made bootom up, than vice-a-versa.\r\n\r\nAnyway.
    I like the \"ik\" symbol, but would like to see it more squared.\r\n\r\nIf the
    name is Infomaniak Network, than both words should be equally emphasized. If Network
    will be something \"changeable\", then I like tel light Helvetica version much
    much better, because it doesn't distract the logo. If Network is just as important
    as Infomaniak, than I'd use the logo with both words in the same type size. And
    same letter manipulation.\r\n\r\nBut. I would write Infomaniak in lower case.
    Including \"I\", so it will make more sense to the logo symbol.\r\n\r\nOne more
    observation: the modified \"k\" at the end of these words has a bit too wide top.
    Translation: right angled stroke goes too much to the right so it visually goes
    over the end of the bottom left slanted stroke. Can anybody translate this crap
    to english readable sentence? :)\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "my english is as bad as yours, so i totally understand what you say. Thanks
    you for so descriptive and precise opinion, helps a lot to make mind. \"Infomaniak
    network\" is the legal name of the company, but sometimes they just communicate
    as \"Infomaniak\" alone. This is the reason why at first i didn't use the same
    typo, but it's not changeable, there is or there isn't, depending on the space
    reserved for the logo (or not), so this is why i decide to finally emphasis the
    Infomaniak word, and make Network smaller.\r\ni will carefully meditate and try
    your suggestion, once again thanks for your time, it's very rare."
