body: "I'm a student making a website for a sushi restaurant, and I'd like some help
  choosing fonts for the logo and for text.\r\n\r\nTo give some background: The restaurant
  owner said he wanted to use white, green, and orange, \"fresh\" colors that emphasize
  the freshness of his sushi, and the light atmosphere of his small, hole-in-the-wall
  restaurant where sunlight pours into a mostly white room with a green/orange/white
  tiled ceiling.\r\n\r\nCompared to other sushi restaurants, his sushi is very creative,
  and very flavorful; their tagline is \"Rockin' Sushi\".  At the same time, he is
  a very masterful chef who has many years of experience as a head chef in California.\r\n\r\n<strong>I
  want to choose a font to pair with their logo, but I'm having a hard time finding
  one that will look good on a light color scheme, fit well with his fish symbol,
  and also give the impression of quality fitting of an experienced chef.</strong>\r\n\r\nMost
  sushi restaurants go for \"brushstroke\" fonts and put them on very dark backgrounds,
  since they want to convey a traditional and high-class atmosphere, but I don't think
  that will work too well.  At the same time many other fonts look too commercial
  to be appetizing; Singo Sushi is known around here as a hidden jewel that nobody
  knows about, yet is of the best quality.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for a font to use
  on their logo?  Should I consider not using the fish symbol?\r\n\r\nAttached is
  their old logo, my rerender of it, and an attempt at combining the symbol with Clarendon/Open
  Sans."

  body: The owner said he is open to changing the shark symbol, although he likes
    the feeling it carries, as do I.  Singo Sushi has attitude in both flavor and
    atmosphere.  They've been using that logo for about 4 years now.

    and the particular execution will help determine what font(s) to use.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I don't know a lot about sushi, but to me the style of the shark drawing
    seems off. You might want to experiment with versions that retain the attitude
    but have more of an oriental (if that's the right word) style.\r\n\r\n> Should
    I consider not using the fish symbol?\r\n\r\nSince they've used it for years,
    if you decide to eliminate it you might want to phase it out gradually. Maybe
    use it small for awhile before eliminating it, or take it out of the logo but
    use it as a graphic element in the menus, etc. Maybe I'm being overcautious but
    restaurants often operate with very small profit margins and I'd be cautious about
    totally eliminating a symbol they're associated with."

  body: Your description of the colour scheme and modern "fresh" approach reminded
    me of [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Talby-by-Marc-Newson-mobile-phone-Interface-design/459087|Marc
    Newson's Talby design for KDDI]], the only phones that I have ever viewed as desirable
    (fun) objects. Another aspect of those designs that I like are the simple icons.
    Perhaps the shark could be subtly updated to clean up and simplify the design
    and perhaps change the colours to bring it in line with everything else, it seems
    to me more jaunty than edgy at the moment.
