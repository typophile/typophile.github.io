body: Have had this font since 1999, but don't know where I got it. It won't work
  right for me on my Mac. Tried regenerating it in Fontographer. My Mac almost stops
  working when I try to put it in Font Book. It gets strange looking in Word, but
  trying to use it in InDesign is impossible. Need to use it or find a new one. Can
  anyone help, please? Thanks.

  body: Thank you, Chris. I guess I have my heart set on this one. I get tons of Chinese
    writing when I ask my Mac to give me info on it. Everything practically locks
    up.  Wish I could find this one that would work.
