body: "Hi All - I'm admittedly struggling with the task of pairing PTF's Seravek with
  a serif, for an identity that would ideally also carry over well to screen/web.
  \r\n\r\nThe aim is to stay mostly neutral with the feel of it all \u2014 complementing
  the little bit of humanity that Seravek has. After quickly ruling out anything too
  old-style or didone (mistake?), and personally not wanting to explore slabs (possibly
  a mistake also?), I'm left wondering whether a transitional serif is most appropriate.
  There is something not working for me with the transitionals I have to test with
  (Plantin, Utopia, etc.), though I can't pinpoint what is feeling off. Of course
  while testing, when I pair the transitionals with something like Helvetica - something
  more neutral than Seravek - the transitionals work just fine. \r\n\r\n In the effort
  to not abandon Seravek, I know there must be serif faces I am unaware of or not
  remembering that will somehow work. Any advice and ideas are much appreciated. This
  is proving harder than expected!"

  body: It may be that you're only looking at older serifs. Try FF Meta Serif, Minion,
    Lyon, Charter or Arnhem.

  body: Thanks for that input Stephen ... I'm not sure why I can't seem to reconcile
    this. I'll explore the type you suggest and others I can find. The want to build
    a pairing that can go to web easily should help me narrow things down a lot (e.g.
    Lyon not being an option as well as other ones I suspect). Any further advice
    or suggestions are much appreciated ...

    for their suggestions. That's one of the nice things about smaller foundries -
    they are usually very helpful with these sorts of things.\r\n\r\nThere were a
    few I was going to recommend, but if you need screen/web use as well, your options
    - for now - will be more limited. \r\n\r\nI second Stephen's recommendation of
    Meta Serif, I can see that working nicely."

  body: "Thanks Chris ... I might just call PTF like you suggest. I've called in the
    past and spoken to Eric and gotten good feedback; I just don't want to be a nag
    and I'm trying to torture myself with this pairing as a learning exercise.\r\n\r\nI'm
    looking more closely at Meta Serif, and am warming up to it quickly. At the same
    time, I want to keep entertaining other serif faces to see if I can't create at
    least a few options.\r\n\r\nPeriodico was fun to check out as well. I feel it
    to be a bit too \"sharp\" ( if I can get away with saying that ) for Seravek (wrong?)
    but it's a beautiful face and has been bookmarked.\r\n\r\nThe considered ideas
    and feedback from the community here are always helpful ... thanks again"

    first half hour, it seems to be a great match for Seravek ...

  body: I'm a little late to this, and as Chris has pointed out, the addition of web
    use complicates things a bit. But I'll throw in two that have worked well in the
    past with Seravek - Gerard Unger's Swift and Kent Lew's Whitman. Not the furthest
    stylistic ends from one another, but not necessarily close. Whitman of course
    can be licensed for web use so that's a plus.

    thoughts over the phone (sorry for my craptastic AT&T service). I really appreciate
    your input, seeing as well ... Seravek is your creation! I will definitely review
    all ideas put on out there and eventually let you know what I've run with and
    how its manifested.\r\n\r\nAnd remember, Glucosumine for those jump-ramp joints.\r\n\r\n"

    should clarify: Font Bureau currently only offers some of the <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WhitmanDisplay\">Whitman
    Display</a> styles for @font-face through <a href=\"http://www.webtype.com/store/search/?q=Whitman\">Webtype</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t know if or when FB might decide to make Whitman text styles available
    for web.\r\n\r\nI did do some initial explorations of a Whitman small text version
    for screen, but when I showed it around, it didn\u2019t really seem to get any
    traction. Or maybe everyone was just too focused on the RE series.\r\n\r\n"
