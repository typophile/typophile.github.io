  saw the SF premier of Helvetica last night and I had to run out during the Q&A to
  catch the last Bart train, but the question I wanted to ask Gary was, at what point
  in the making of <em>[[Helvetica]]</em> (the film) did he realize this was not a
  film about a typeface, but about a commentary about the design and cultural landscape
  we live in (and that we are products of)? His film is really, really much more than
  I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be much more academic and historic.
  It was so much more than that. Helvetica is so much more than a typeface, it's a
  cultural landmark and Gary Hustwit's film put it into great context.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt
  was so great to see footage of [[Massimo Vignelli]] extolling Helvetica and the
  AmericanAirlines mark (that he designed, in Helvetica) put back to back with the
  Helvetica detractors.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe other question I would ask is: What is
  your Helvetica story?<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn design school I had this fear of Helvetica,
  everybody did. And then I discovered it accidentally when I fell in love with a
  [[Bitstream]] face called [[Swiss]] (I was a sophomore; it was an easy mistake.)
  It was great and I spent a whole semester using it. Then in my career it was easy
  to ignore Helvetica until BMW's brand guidelines dictated it and again I saw it's
  merits.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf I were a design instructor, this film would be required
  material. Kudos again to Gary."

    introduction\r\nto Helvomi... uh, Helvee... uh, Helvetica. In fact it's interesting\r\nthat
    I had any reaction to it at all, since the first time I consciously\r\nthought
    about its [de]merits I really had a weak grasp of typography.\r\nBut over time
    my feelings haven't changed in essence: starting out\r\nwith an intuitive unease
    about it, I've now elaborated my opinions\r\nwith a more studious grasp of what's
    wrong with it.\r\n\r\nBTW, I was also very pleasantly surprised by the movie.\r\nGary
    has done an amazing job conveying a balanced but\r\nnonetheless passionate story.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    sure Gary could answer for himself, but from what I got out of his Q&A here in
    Buffalo, he meant for this film to be a survey of the last 50 years of graphic
    design, and Helvetica happened to be the vehicle to tell this story. quite ingenious,
    i think: more interesting than a film only about a single typeface."

    hype. Erik Spiekermann spoke at my graduation, Spring '06.
