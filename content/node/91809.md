  in its regular weight.\r\n\r\nI have tried a google search and have talked to a
  major type vendor here in the UK and no trace of this face can be found. Has anybody
  heard of it or, even better, know where it can be found/bought?\r\n\r\nIt is a roman,
  almost engraving style face, with pretty even weight on the strokes and very slight
  almost imperceptible serifs. The only example I have is in all in upper case.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in anticipation\r\n\r\nNick"
