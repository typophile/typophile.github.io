  I came across this which speaks of what may be [[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/internet-star-least-473-years-old/|the
  first known use of the @ symbol]]. Orthographic history is really *not* one of my
  stronger suits, so I can't confirm or deny this. Just thought it may be of interest.

  body: I thought I had read somewhere that it might have been used as early as the
    6th or 7th century for 'ad' (at, to or toward). But yeah, 1536 is pretty early.

  body: "That claim by Professor Giorgio Stabile of his discovery of the @ sign in
    a document of 1536 has been doing the rounds for years, but to be fair to the
    professor he doesn\u2019t claim it in quite these terms.\r\n\r\n\u201COne can\u2019t
    say this is the first example of its use, as ancient financial institutions may
    have earlier examples lying forgotten in their archives,\u201D Stabile said over
    iced tea in Rome\u2019s scenic Piazza Navona. The professor discovered the document
    while doing research for a visual history of the 20th century, which is due to
    be published by the Treccani Encyclopedia. In the document a trader called Francesco
    Lapi describes the arrival in Spain of ships bearing treasure from Latin America.
    \u201CThere an amphora of wine, which is one thirtieth of a barrel, is worth 70
    or 80 ducats,\u201D Lapi wrote in his letter, sent from Seville to a colleague
    in Rome. \u201CNo symbol is born by chance,\u201D Stabile said. \u201CThis one
    has represented the entire history of navigation on the seas and has now come
    to typify travel in cyberspace.\u201D\r\n\r\nI forget where I found this fancy
    piece of stuff, but it is all over the Web.\r\n\r\nWhat I wonder is, how many
    early financial documents Stabile looked at. Italy was the home of some very sophisticated
    accounting practice a long time before the 16th century, and there are plenty
    of surviving archives that have been studied. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised to
    learn that there is a symbol looking like @ in much earlier documents from one
    of the big trading or banking centres like Venice, Genoa, Milan or Florence. It
    might be worth asking one of the economic historians who read these archives.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I\u2019m no palaeographer, but I personally doubt if @ has anything to do specifically
    with amphoras of wine. (But just a moment. Wine imported to Europe from the New
    World in 1536. That has to be a first.) Or with the Spanish weight called the
    <em>arroba</em>. The term <em>arroba</em> is derived from Arabic, and probably
    dates from a long time before the <em>reconquista</em>. Maybe there is a symbol
    for the <em>arroba</em> (or even the amphora) that looks a bit like @. Incorrigibly
    sceptical as I am, I suspect that the term <em>arroba</em> was only recently adopted
    as a convenient Spanish (and French) name for a symbol that didn\u2019t have one.
    If there is proof to the contrary, please let us see it.\r\n\r\nLess excited historians
    do indeed seem to agree that the modern @ is simply a flourished form of Latin
    <em>ad</em> (at), for use in repeated lines of accounts containing phrases like
    \u201Cso many pounds or barrels of something at \u2013 @ \u2013 so much per pound/barrel\u201D.
    Commercial documents are full of abbreviations or symbols for other Latin commercial
    terms like \xA3 (capital L) for <em>libra</em> (pound as currency), <em>per</em>
    (for which we keep the Latin word), % for <em>per centum,</em> and & for <em>et</em>.
    The so-called <em>solidus</em> or forward slash (maybe a long s) for dividing
    shillings and pence (<em>solidi</em> and <em>denarii</em>) is another. So we are
    lucky that the computer keyboard \u2013 which is a typewriter keyboard (and typewriters
    were designed as office machines) \u2013 was not cluttered with the symbols for
    more of them, like <em>per</em>, which can be quite elaborate. These symbols were
    made as types for commercial printing and schemes for printers\u2019 type cases
    in the 19th century show them. \r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s of interest, here is @ in
    a specimen of the Miller foundry in Edinburgh dated 1822:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Miller
    P2 p 1822 with @ - 500_4030.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs this a typographical first? Or are
    there offers of something earlier? \r\n\r\nPerhaps Dr St\xF6tzner can tell us.

  body: "Nice topic. The link below has a few more illustrations, including a hand-written
    one from 1775 and some typographical ones of the early 20th century. Some of the
    other signs shown are good examples of James' point about the variety of commercial
    symbols in type.\r\n[[http://hapax.qc.ca/Pourquoi_arrobe_dans_10646.html]]\r\n\r\n<cite>(But
    just a moment. Wine imported to Europe from the New World in 1536. That has to

    way around. I believe Lapi was commenting there on how high the price was of Spanish
    wine when shipped to the New World."

  body: "That\u2019s a great link, and it has badly dented my scepticism. In fact
    it sent me to the abbreviations at the back of my big dictionary of the Real Academia
    Espa\xF1ol, 14th edition 1914 (didn\u2019t think of looking there), where @ is
    shown for the arroba.\r\n\r\nAnd that document of 1775, with its well-shaped @s,
    is impressive. It\u2019s pretty late, though. It would be good to have more and
    earlier examples, from Italy, Spain, England... \r\n\r\nThe examples of typographical
    @ for arroba given in the link are very English or North American in appearance,
    as Spanish types in the 19th century often are, so were maybe made for \u2018at\u2019
    and adopted for the other purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd I\u2019d clearly misread Lapi...\r\n\r\nWell
    now. What about a typographical @ earlier than 1822?\r\n"

  body: While the current [[www.rae.es|DRAE]] has the symbol in its entry for arroba,
    at least up until mid 1900s I couldn't find an example of its use in the dictionary.  Not
    to say it wasn't used as an abbreviation before computers, in fact the entry in
    the DPHD makes it sound like it was used before and then simply "popularized"
    because of computers, but in terms of being common enough to make it into the
    dictionary ... doesn't seem so.

  body: "I am delighted to see Mr. Mosley respond to that. I can not offer a printed
    sample antedating 1822 (one can hardly beat a St. Bride\u2019s scholar in a matter
    like this ;-).\r\nAs for paleography, surely more investigations into old manuscript
    archives would have to be undertaken. 1538 is impressively early. The only hint
    on a possible even earlier usage I found was in a paleographers manual from Portugal
    (see http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=143 ). The indication
    of \u201C52\u201D at the first @ in this image means \u201C1520 decade\u201D.
    Unfortunately, no original source is specified in that booklet.\r\n\r\nIf any
    further research upon the @ emerges I am prepared to register it under Signographie.de/Focus.
    \r\n\r\nFinally, cheers to Mr. Mosley for the \u201CDr\u201D Stoetzner, but I
    have to refuse this honouring unless a kind of \u201CDr occ[assionis] c[ausa]\u201D
    may apply ;-) ."
