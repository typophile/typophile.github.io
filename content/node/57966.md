  typophile friends,\r\n\r\nWe just released <strong>[[http://www.outrasfontes.com/force.htm|Force]]</strong>,
  a contemporary sans serif ultra-black family designed by Ricardo Esteves Gomes (that's
  me). \r\n\r\nThere are 4 font styles: Force Regular, with an upright roman structure;
  Force Italic, with more cursive lowercase forms; Force Shadow, that can be used
  alone or as a second layer to Force Regular; and Force Dingbats, cointaining some
  pictograms. Each font file has some OpenType features: discretionary ligatures,
  fractions, subscript and superscript. The Force family is suitable for big-size
  high impact situations like posters, headlines, titles, magazines, packaging and
  many others you may creatively think of.\r\n\r\nAvailable at <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/force/|MyFonts]]</strong>,:
  $29,90 per font & 1 free font.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it."
