  to \"Arno pro caption\". It doesnt need to be very close!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trans1x1_6439.gif]\r\n\r\nOf
  course a free font would be best (because I need it only once) but I would be willing
  to pay for one if no other option.\r\n\r\nWhy ttf? Because I want to export a document
  from OpenOffice into pdf (Open Office creates very solid, linked PDFs) and OpenOffice
  doesnt support otf in pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much for any ideas\r\n\r\nPS.\r\nI
  tried uploading an image of the font (http://www.itcfonts.com/Assets/images/trans1x1.gif)
  but didnt succeed."

    it from .otf to .ttf format. You might not get the features, but I don't believe
    Open Office supports them anyway, does it?\r\n\r\n"
