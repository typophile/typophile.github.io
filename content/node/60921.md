body: "Hi everyone,\r\nmy name is S\xE9bastien Morlighem. I\u2019m a french teacher
  & researcher in history of typography & type design.\r\nI\u2019m also the curator
  of the Biblioth\xE8que typographique, a \u2018work-in-progress\u2019 book collection
  mainly dedicated to punchcutters & type designers for Ypsilon \xE9diteur (http://www.ypsilonediteur.com,
  english website soon), who\u2019ll make its debut in February 2010 with a (french-english)
  book about Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida, co-written with Martin Majoor & introduced
  by Jan Middendorp. There\u2019ll be essays about the making of Pascal, Photina &
  ITC Mendoza Roman, as well as shorter pieces about less-known typefaces, all carefully
  documented & fully illustrated.\r\n\r\nApart of spreading the news (more about it
  In Mexico during the ATypI), I\u2019m calling the Typophile community for help about
  ITC Mendoza Roman. I\u2019m searching for any judgements/opinions/papers about this
  so uncanny face, especially around its time or release (1991). Many thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nAll
  the best\r\nS\xE9bastien"
