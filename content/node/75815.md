  of. A quick example is a topography (not typography!) map versus a simple map showing
  country borders (of which, of course, there are many variations of!).\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know how I might go about finding a map that has a bit of a crafty, old-world
  feel? \r\n\r\nI don't mean a one simply thrown onto an old manuscript (as a super
  clean vector will never really look that old).\r\n\r\nI have a client for an identity
  who is going with a bit of a traveler/mariner theme--we need a good map.\r\n\r\nThere's
  something about the 7th one in this list that I like, perhaps the illustrative quality
  (which would be appropriate) is drawing me in. (forgive the pun)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webresourcesdepot.com/free-vector-world-maps-collection/\r\n\r\nI
  know it's a shot in the dark but I'm hoping someone out there has some knowledge
  of geological or cartological terminology--because I just don't know how to ask
  for what it is I'm looking for. (and NO \"illustrated maps\" as a search term generates
  results that are way off the mark)"

    You can refine your search with words like \"african\" or \"ocean\" or whatever.\r\n\r\nThey
    aren't free, but the prices are extremely reasonable for most of them."

    any big, old library or historical society would be a good place to start. Just
    bring a digital camera - photocopiers won't do! Some old library's even have a
    <a href=\"http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/macro/copy.html\">copy stand</a> available
    to mount your camera. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Evan,\r\n\r\nPictures of real Ye Olde Worlde maps are by definition bitmaps
    (as said above, photographs of actual old maps). They didn't think in the 15th
    century of supplying vector files :-)\r\nHowever, the samples you point to are
    all vector files, and since it seems this is for a corporate identity, that <em>would</em>
    be preferable over a bitmap.\r\n\r\nUsing data from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSHHS\">GSSHS</a>,
    I can produce high-quality Illustrator files in just about any map projection
    you can think of (Mercator -- deprecated, actually --, Mollweide, Robinson, Werner,
    and loads more), and even throw in country borders. But there are two huge \"howevers\":\r\n\r\n1.
    The data is contemporary. I don't think Dubai's Palm Islands are incorporated
    (I'd have to check), but the Netherlands for example have all of their polders
    filled in. .. Come to think of it, I don't think that's visible on a global map
    ...\r\n\r\n2. The country <em>borders</em> are contemporary as well! In your link
    of examples, the Illustrator file 'with borders' clearly shows Yugoslavia as one
    big country (but not the Soviet Union). Whether or not that makes it \"ye olde
    worlde\" depends on your age ...\r\n\r\nA third 'however' is that it'd require
    you to manually make it old style. Sepia? Blurry lines? It mainly depends on the
    intended target size & usage."

  body: "> since it seems this is for a corporate identity, \r\n> [vector] would be
    preferable over a bitmap\r\n\r\nThat's a good point; logos are generally vector
    art.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that while the map itself would be
    in the public domain due to its age, the actual photograph of it might be copyrighted
    by the photographer. And this would make sense as the photographer may have gone
    to some time and expense to find, photograph, and retouch it. And in some cases
    the photographer might be able to easily tell you're using his photo due to a
    digital watermark, or some specific retouching he's done to it, etc.\r\n\r\nSo
    be sure that both the map AND the photo of it are in the public domain (or use
    a licensed photo, like from a stock photo company, and be sure the license agreement
    permits use in logos). Or use a vector image made specifically for the identity."

  body: "Blueflag--that is just about the perfect link. Those maps look great. Now
    to see if we can use them--which shouldn't be too hard to figure out since I live
    in Austin and have access to UT's great libraries. That points me to a question
    I was greatly curious about, thank you to James. Some maps might need a credit
    for usage, some can't be used at all for this. We'll see.\r\n\r\nBut what the
    map is actually needed for, at this point, is the landing page background of the
    client's webpage. We're going with a compass for the mark, and this will tie together
    with that mark. I suppose it would be nice to use it on the business card design
    as well, but at the very least, for the website, perhaps its not too bad a thing
    to have a small, somewhat unnoticeable credit in the bottom corner. Maybe if it
    comes down to it they'll let me go take my own pictures so I can have infinite
    use.\r\n\r\nAnd Joe, thank for the link to Tierra Nueva. I'm not sure if my client
    is looking for that direction with the type, we'll come to that bridge. They would
    like a nice script for their name and my first thought is to checkout Sudtipos
    and see if something will match the mark--but I'll certainly check out if this
    could work as well. "
