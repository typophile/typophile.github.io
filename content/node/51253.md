body: So I was sitting around the other day and realized that I had some nice development
  on some type to help express my political views and had unfortunately done nothing
  with it. So I sat down for an hour and pushed something out for fun. I figured I
  would post it and see if we can get a poll on election day of the typography crowd
  up here. So throw them up! Take a few minutes (or more if able) and show your support
  for your party with a fancy little type lock up. You know, if you are into that
  kind of thing.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/obama-we-believe_3767.gif]

    election(s). This one has recieved so much attention outside the U.S that people
    over here and elsewhere have been saying we non-U.S citizens of the free Western
    world should get to vote for the U.S president since it affects us in more ways
    than we care to mention.\r\n\r\nI like Barak Obama and think he would make an
    excellent president in 15 to 25 years from now, when he has more life experience
    and experience holding executive office. I know, he is an early bloomer, and America
    really needs change right now, but installing a young president who isn't white-skinned
    is not the way to do it. Obama's skin color is not an issue with me. His lack
    of experience and world weariness is tho. And not being white-skinned makes him
    the target of hatred and bigotry. I don't want to see him get blown away. Watching
    Kennedy die was bad enuff. A liberal white-skinned nominee devoted to change and
    pulling America out of Iraq, Afganistan and Pakistan, funding the war veterens
    hospitals and public health care system properly would be a better choice.\r\n\r\nA
    large number of the public are still using the outmoded term \"race\" when referring
    to Obama. There is no such thing as race or races within the human species. We
    are all of the same race&#8212;homo sapiens. In a politically-correct liberal
    society, \"race\" should not be an issue to the extent it does not even rate a
    mention, yet people continue referring to Barak Obama's \"race\". So we ain't
    there yet.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    just any old \"experienced white guy\". A liberal white-skinned guy, or even a
    white-skined woman.\r\n\r\nThe point about skin color is that Obama's poses serious
    obstacles to his potential effectiveness as commander in chief and obstacles to
    America moving forward. U.S citizens threw away their best candidate, Hillary
    Clinton. Hillary was well qualified for the job. British author Doris Lessing
    expressed much the same view I am expressing.\r\n\r\nExperienced white guys are
    not the problem. America's privately funded republic government is the problem.
    That and economic dependence on her munitions and war industry. America's economy
    runs down when it doesn't have a war to fight. As Gore Vidal said, \"Why be a
    senator when you can just buy one?\"\r\n\r\nGiving a younger person with a brain
    a chance at leading the country is a nice idea, but how practical is it?\r\n\r\nAnd

    campaign. He came from basically out of nowhere and managed to unseat the frontrunner
    in the primary, Hillary. He had an organized field operation that turned out the
    vote in places that had not voted for a democrat in decades. His first real act
    as candidate was choosing a vice president; he went with a man who has the experience
    he lacks rather than a publicity grab like Sarah Palin. He has shown extraordinary
    judgment and restraint in the general election. I have no doubt that Obama will
    staff his administration with smart, experienced advisors. I trust that he will
    have learned from what went on the past 8 years and cooperate with the other side,
    especially since he's facing the sorts of challenges (economy, wars, healthcare,
    global warming) that require a bipartisan effort rather than just ramming legislation
    through.\r\n\r\nAnd importantly, he represents a chance for America to redeem
    its tattered reputation abroad."
