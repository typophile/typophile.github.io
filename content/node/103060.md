body: "I am doing a class project for Rolo candy, a counter top Point of Purchase
  display. I have not been able to find a \"Rolo\" font and I fear that because the
  product was created so long ago, that the lettering was hand drawn. Is there a Rolo
  font, or something very close to it. I would prefer free - I am a struggling student
  - free is always good!\r\n\r\n"
