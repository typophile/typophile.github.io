  to school in Georgia for my undergrad before transferring to the bay area. I will
  be living in the bay area and employers I hear generally look for a b.fa degree
  as opposed to our school's b.a. degree- which only has an emphasis in g.d. I do
  have that degree as well as I completed it upon passing a portfolio review for the
  b.f.a.\r\n\r\nFriends say not to take less than 35/40k a year at minimum because
  of our skill level.\r\n\r\nThe bay area is full of shitty designers, and where the
  good ones come in, there is a lot of hard competition- mostly from California College
  of the Arts and Art Center. I can't compete. Of course  I know that the portfolio
  I have matters in the end, but is there a place to draw the line and just say, \"No
  - that's not enough?\". \r\n\r\nwhat amount is realistic?"

  body: "I'm not sure what you are asking, here. Are you asking if you will earn enough
    money to live in the San Francisco area? Or are you asking whether or not it is
    true that local design studios tend to favor graduates from local \"star power\"
    art schools\u2014like CCA and Art Center in this case\u2014over anyone else?\r\n\r\nI
    can't vouch for SF myself; I've never worked or lived there. But in my experience,
    every market has a range of studios willing to pay a range of salaries. Some of
    them pay better than others. It is possible to make more than 40K, too, but you'd
    probably have to work mad overtime for that. Will you earn enough to live in SF?
    That depends on who hires you, in the end\u2026\r\n\r\nLocal art schools do tend
    to dominate their geographic areas. Its a head and reputation thing really. It
    is never impossible for graduates from other schools to get work in those markets;
    employers just often think that they are \"better\"\u2026 maybe because they went
    to those schools themselves, have worked with people who have, or just believe
    the hype. The art schools also have big alumni and referral networks, which makes
    it easier to get a job in some places if you can fit in that picture.\r\n\r\nEvery
    market has its own \"favorite\" schools. But if you write a killer cover letter,
    have a good resume, and a good portfolio, you'll get interviews at great places,
    too."

  body: "hi dan, sorry for being unclear.\r\n\r\nI guess my question is about salary.
    what can on expect to be offered, generally, just coming out of school? what should
    one hope for realistically? how as a ,graphic designer, do you know what you are
    worth?"

  body: "Well, this is really a personal question. The answer depends on 1) how much
    money you want, 2) how much money you really need, 3) how much a specific market
    pays entry-level designers in general, and 4) how much the studios that hire you
    themselves are willing to pay.\r\n\r\nSome studios are small (and mean?) and will
    just pay you a tad over minimum wage. I guess you could hit the jackpot, too.
    Back in the days of the internet bubble, I heard an urban legend about a recent
    grad from my school who got 72K right away\u2026 those were the days ;-)\r\n\r\nI
    don't mean to be morose, but the probable answer to your question is: just enough.
    Whatever that means. Entry-level salaries are rarely \"great\"\u2026"

  body: "<em>I heard an urban legend about a recent grad from my school who got 72K
    right away</em> I agree Dan; legend would have be the operative word there...
    \r\n\r\nWhere I live and work graduates command a starting salary slightly <em>less</em>
    (between 5-10K p/a) than the local cost of living, which apparently is cheaper
    than metropolitan Australia.\r\n\r\nBoth Amanda's question and Dan's response
    highlight that 'local alumni dominate local networks' thing \u2013 so if you want
    to command premium price it's not worth moving out of the area. Emigration is
    an expensive business in many (undocumented) ways."

    so fast! I'm not being too off-base here\u2026 in 1999, designers where geting
    salaries in the bay area that were way abnormal. The internet boom was great while
    it lasted."

  body: "Well, I don't mean to be rude what so ever....but you might want to brush
    up on your writing skills.  Not that you need them in order to design graphics,
    but I also had a hard time deciphering what exactly you were asking.  If salary
    is most important to you coming straight out of college--you will most likely
    not be getting a design job right away, and will need some writing/speech/interpersonal
    skills for a temporary job.  \r\n\r\nReality is, yes, graphic design is a very
    hard field to get into, and VERY competitive.  I mean, it is important to have
    a degree from an accredited program, but that's worth almost nothing without a
    SOLID portfolio and legit experience.  It's almost impossible to get a legit job
    in design right out of school, unless you've already interned during school and
    what not.  What's your internship experience?  Here's a good website showing you
    how to really make your portfolio stand out from all your other competitors:  http://www.youthedesigner.com/2008/06/30/12-steps-to-a-super-graphic-design-portfolio/
    \ \r\n\r\nSo, also a lot of designers start off freelancing to have some small
    side jobs on their own if they can't go under the wing of a bigger company.  If
    you're new to freelancing, it's pretty much just running your own business, getting
    clients and tailoring your work to their needs...which also involves the work
    of taxation: http://www.anti9to5guide.com/2006/10/27/freelance-tax-faq/ some faq's
    to help guide you through that process.  But in order to actually establish, you
    need to actually be GOOD at marketing yourself.  You can try out http://www.marketingdegree.net/
    to see what marketing is all about and how to build relationships with your clients--this
    is the ultimate root of all your business.\r\n\r\nGood luck."
