  body: Well... it has all the copperplate characteristics except for the tiny serifs.
    &#40;which is in fact very characteristic for copperplate&#41; <BR>The &#34;J&#34;
    also has the copperplate shape. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ITC Blair.  <BR>Could
    it be a modified copperplate?!?!?!? <BR> <BR>
