body: "I've been working with Fontographer on and off for the last six years - first
  on PC and now on Mac. The handwriting font I've been working on recently needs to
  be output in both Mac and PC ttf versions. I've managed a good output for the Mac,
  but the hyphen (and occasionally other characters) won't code, leaving nasty holes
  in text or Times substitutions in the PC version. I have managed to avoid kerning
  pairs by careful design and spacing - and I haven't left any duff vectors crossing
  over.\r\n\r\nHeeeeelp! What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nAny serious suggestions gratefully
  received."

  body: "I had a funky experience with opentype the other day (not entirely relevant,
    but maybe!) where I was trying to insert a apostrophe into a well known brands
    typeface, everything in the tables was jiggy, but in applications, no apostrophe!\r\n\r\nTurns
    out the problem was (quite obvious really) that the cells for single quote, apostrophe,
    quote mark all require an entry for the application to use the correct glyph according
    to context. So my apostrophe required entries at 2018, 2019 & 0027.\r\nMaybe a
    similar problem to yours. Maybe.\r\n\r\nPeace!"

  body: "That's kind of familiar - I had the same initial problem with apostrophes.
    My problem is that on generating the font, the cell for the hyphen is not generating
    at all so that the system (be it mac of pc) substitutes a times character (in
    Word) or simply leaves a gap (in Adobe apps). Does this ring any bells?\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the suggestions"

  body: "I always check the path direction! I know it's a common problem - that and
    failing to simplify and balance handles etc etc...\r\nI've actually stripped everything
    out twice and copied individual characters into a new font to avoid these problems
    - the Mac font is now fine - works in all apps, it's just the PC font that is
    being a pain in the proverbial!\r\n\r\nThanks for that suggestion - it's always
    worth checking."

  body: I just re-read the last suggestion - and yes, I always delete the font in
    its entirety prior to installing a subsequent version - I fell foul of that basic
    error a long time ago!

    glyph maybe missing on screen - but what happens at print?"
