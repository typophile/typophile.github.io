body: "I have been converting fonts from PostScript / TrueType that I originally designed
  in Fontographer to OpenType fonts using Font Lab 5.0.4 MAC version. \r\n\r\nIn Fontographer,
  a CORRECT path direction is defined as having the outer contour or path of a glyph
  running clockwise, and the inside counters of a glyph running counter-clockwise.
  An INCORRECT path direction will result in the character looking heavy. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pathdirection_6532.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  appears to me that FONT LAB has the paths running in the opposite direction from
  Fontographer. Is this true, or am I reading it incorrectly?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pathdirections1_4611.jpg]\r\n\r\nDoes
  it matter which direction the paths are created so long as the counters run opposite
  to the outer contours? If so, which is correct... the way FONTLAB defaults, or the
  way FONTOGRAPHER says paths are correct?\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of curiosity AND
  I need to know before I go into over 700 glyphs to make sure they have correct paths.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nRL"

  body: 'I don''t think it matters - just depends on whether you''re making PS or
    TT flavoured OT.  PS flavour has outside contours running anti-clockwise.  I usually
    just select all glyphs and change contours to postscript. '

    on purpose or through negative tracking could show white where the crossover occurs.

  body: "<em>Checking/fixing this is something FontLab can do for you!</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    but it's something FontLab does oddly, at least for me. If I select all characters
    and then select Contours &gt; Paths &gt; Set PS Direction, the contours which
    have changed are indicated by a black bar at the top of the affected glyph box.
    When I save the changes, the black bars disappear, as they are supposed to. But
    if I perform the same operation later, several of the previously-corrected glyphs
    show the black bar AGAIN, even though nothing has been done to the highlighted
    outlines in the interim. As I said: rather odd..."

    I did some testing... Generated a font in Fontographer as both a PS file and a
    TTF file. Looked at them, and the paths were different, but consistent in each
    font.\r\n\r\n\r\nI still wonder why FONTLAB would render PostScript paths in the
    opposite direction from what  Fontographer calls \"correct\" path. Or am I just
    misunderstanding what those little arrows in FontLab are actually pointing toward?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRL"

    is mentally challenged calling the \"correct\" paths in the opposite direction
    from Adobe's recommendation? \r\n\r\nI wonder if it has anything to do with way
    back when... Altsys developed Fontographer, Freehand, and PageMaker... competitors
