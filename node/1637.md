  body: Jared, I think you may have gotten as close as we can get to this one. I agree
    Trafton has many very similar features, but my guess is that it may have been
    a style model for this Trans Cal logo artwork. In other words, I think the reason
    we have had such a hard time with this is that it is not a font at all. &#40;I
    know these are sometimes &#39;famous last words&#39;, but I just don&#39;t think
    this looks like any font I&#39;ve seen except House Industries <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg5.html"
    target="_blank">&#34;Fabulous&#34;</a> &#40;at the bottom of the page&#41;, which
    is also rather close to this. Trafton image follows &#40;also from the Script
    Guide, and note that the letters do not connect -- something it&#39;s hard to
    tell from sample books&#41;:<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18625.gif"

  body: Another quick thought.. Could the T and the C be a different font from the
    others .. or possibly hand drawn? and if so what font is the other part?

  body: Frankly, to me this looks like some 50s air company  <BR>custom drawn logo,
    really. I haven&#39;t got high hopes  <BR>of someone finding an exact match. It
    all looks pretty  <BR>homogenous, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s subsituted  <BR>characters
    or anything like that.

    I&#39;d see if a new post would cure what ails it.
