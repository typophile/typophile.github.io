  to find anything on it.\r\n\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/39436506@N00/\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nEric\r\n\r\n\r\nupdate:\r\n2.23.05
  \ 2:42 am\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample of the right leg where stem meets serif. I
  was noticing that the stem, if using a purely geometric rectangle for the serif,
  visually makes the serif look like it bows. The sample on the left side, I raised
  the serifs a bit at the base of the stem, seems to work better, doesn't bow anymore,
  at smaller sizes,at least, If you make it too big, the mod's become apparent. Any
  suggestions, diff was to bracket or maybe just a more subtle angle, or even maybe
  an extremely shallow curve?  AA.jpg\r\n\r\nupdate:\r\n2.24.05 11:44 am\r\n\r\nconstruction.pdf"

    [[Bauer]] Foundry in Frankfurt, 1933. Reiner was Hungarian by birth, I believe,
    but he studied and worked in Germany between the wars, designing quite a few typefaces.
    What else would you like to know? I have a lot buried in reference books behind
    me\u2026\r\n\r\nBTW, if you like old German specimen books, <a href=http://www.typeoff.de/?p=29\">here
    is a nice one</a>."

    drew at some point. Some resources are better to rely on than others. Just because
    a designer, or someone else, dubs something a revival, that doesn't necessarily
    make it so. And some fonts that don't call themselves revivals are\u2026\r\n\r\nA
    good reference is the Klingspor Museum in Offenbach, which has lists for most
    major 20th Century German type designers (and then some\u2026) on its site. <a

  body: "This is tricky. Everyone seems to have a different answer here.\r\n\r\nFor
    a font this old, there are no legal problems (probably) with digitizing the design.
    The designer is dead, but he may have relatives who are involved in design. This
    happens sometimes, that they would like to have their permission asked.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think you can call it Gotika though, although that would take some research.
    Bauer released the font, and the Neufville Foundation in Spain is Bauer now. They
    hold the old copyrights, and distribute fonts (digitizations of old ones and new
    fonts, too\u2026 for instance the best digital version of Futura available is
    theirs\u2026 Bauer Germany released Futura in metal in 1927). It is within the
    realm of possibility that they are working on their own revival, in which case
    they may have already applied for a design patent in the European Union. A typeface's
    design may be registered and protected within the EU for 25 years. Older designs
    cannot in general be patented, but you never know.\r\n\r\nSome people will tell
    you to ignore all of this, and they would call it all \"unreasonable.\" I think
    that it would just be polite. If we were talking about a type foundry which had
    NO connection with the present, or a type from the 1800s, it might be a little
    different. Its best to go case-by-case on this.\r\n\r\nHonestly, in my opinion,
    the best thing to do would be to digitize it, and then submit it to Neufville.
    If they would take it and distribute it for you, then you could call it Gotika
    for sure, and there wouldn't be any problems at all ever, because they would back
    it, etc."

  body: "Oh, another thing: if you digitize it, don't say the following when you sell
    it (on MyFonts.com or whereever): This is my NEW FONT, by Eric West. Better for
    everyone's karma would be wording like: Gotika (or, insert other name here), originally
    by Imre Reiner, 1933. Revived and Updated* by Eric West, 2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Updated,
    because you clearly must update it. Old metal types almost always cannot/should
    not be redone just 1:1 digitally. Some things must invariably change to suit contemporary
    usage. Not to mention that today's standard character set is quite different than
    one from 1933. The Euro, for instance! But subtle things, too, e.g., Small Caps,
    different figure options, etc."

  body: "Sorry not to get back to this sooner, Eric, I was away most of the week at
    the ATypI conference in Helsinki.\r\n\r\n1. Whether display or text, conventions
    change over time. We use type in 2005 differently than we did in 1933. Also, the
    original Gotika was made primarily for German-language use. But I can almost guarantee
    you that any revival of Gotika that you make will primarily be used anywhere else
    but Germany (but this isn't the place for another Blackletter debate).\r\n\r\nLots
    of glyphs we use today (even in display faces, like the Euro and the @ symbols,
    just to name a few, were probably never cast in metal for the original Gotika.
    And don't forget the need for accents, even CE, Baltic, and/or Turkish accents,
    because German accents alone just won't be enough (see above paragraph).\r\n\r\nAnd,
    in the past, mistakes were sometimes made. Sadly, you probably can't get your
    hands on Reimer's notes (if such things exist) to see when and how he made which
    decisions, and why.\r\n\r\n2. I think that literal revivals are far less interesting
    than adaptations. Some change is good. Just make sure that your customers know
    which changes, if any, you make, and why. They'll thank you for your honesty and
    clarity.\r\n\r\n3, I don't know where you can get better images of Gotika. Paul
    Shaw and Peter Bain wrote a series of books for a Blackletter exhibition at Cooper
    Union in 1998. These have Gotika images inside them. Also, some public libraries
    in the US may have some copies of specimen books with Gotika. Any 1930s or 1940s
    Bauer book would do, I guess. If you ever come to Germany, I could show you some
    resources in the Frankfurt area. If I were you, I would e-mail Neufville in Barcelona
    (?) and ask them if they have and/or know of any other resources.\r\n\r\nHow's
    that?"

  body: The reproduction quality is only important to a degree. You want to get a
    look at the letters, but I would recommend that you not scan-and-trace! Look at
    the letters, use your eyes, and then make the outlines on screen. This will take
    longer but it will result in better, and probably more consistent, letters.
