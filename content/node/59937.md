body: "I\u2019m looking for a sans serif with a \u201Clong\u201D f in small case,
  what I meen is an f that goes below the other letters. There seem to be many like
  this in italic but i\u2019m looking for this in a regular cut. Sorry for the weird
  explanation but I dont now the word for this style, if there is one. I know Anivers
  and Fedra has this kind of small case regular f."
