  recently issued \u201CPersona\u201D film by Criterion. It reminds me Optima but
  with rounded corners. (Sorry the first two letters are cut off, the sticker was
  covering them.) Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_8265_4218.JPG]\r\n\r\nHere's
  the whole cover:\r\nhttp://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/release_boxshots/4220-24e878ae87060090d71abcc9fbde79d3/701_DF_box_348x490_original.jpg"

  body: "In thread http://typophile.com/node/120887 I asked the experts who congregate
    in the general discussions forum if they had any information on a lower case for
    Florida. \r\nSome experts on font history do not seem to participate in the the
    general discussions forum, but do contribute to the font ID forum.\r\nSo I might
    as well ask the same question here; does anyone have any information on a lower
    case for Florida?\r\nDon"
