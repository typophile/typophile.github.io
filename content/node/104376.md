  typefaces that are condensed or have a condensed version in which the leg of the
  capital R descends below the baseline and is curved. (what is that called?)\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "\"Hooked,\" perhaps? But I think your explanation is perfectly clear.\r\n\r\nAre
    you looking for serif, sans, script? \"Condensed\" might suggest sans, but the
    feature you mention is more common in serifed faces."
