body: I know this could very well be custom lettering, but I'm interested in anything
  that resembles this type style and period. Any help is greatly appreciated, even
  other references or examples. Thanks.

  body: So quiet. I didn't think this ID was that uninteresting. Sorry about that.
    I really like this (19th century?) serif and would still love to know what it
    is exactly or what it seems to resemble. Where can I get my hands on this sort
    of thing, besides the usual suspects? (Letterhead fonts, Archive Type, Walden
    Font Co., etc.) Thanks again everyone.

  body: "Ditto. I flipped thru the Clarendons but nothing was bold enough.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a nice design, has a Louise Fili-esque look but I'm not gonna endure her endless
    flash intro to find out if she did it."

  body: I agree with the Louise FIli similarity. This logo has the same kind of class
    that is found in her work. I'm still digging around for this and I've found a
    few close(ish) matches including <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-souvenir/bold/">
    ITC Souvenir Bold </a>. But nothing seems to rival the delicacy of the logo.

  body: "Louise Fili did do the logo.\r\n\r\n[Edit: Ok. I had it confused with another
    company. I'm not sure she did do it. But, her site has been updated and there
    are many new beautifully designed items to view.]"
