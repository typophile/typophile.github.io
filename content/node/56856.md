  body: "I do not recognize either of these. The \"Mother\" lettering looks custom,
    because of the way the letters fit together (at least, the letters were positioned
    separately, IMHO). \"Howdy!\" looks like an amateur font effort, maybe from a
    scrapbooking site. Pizzadude's (Jakob Fischer) [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/dandygal/|Dandygal]]
    is similar.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
