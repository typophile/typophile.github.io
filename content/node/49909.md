    Kontrapunkt designed the new typeface \u2018Via\u2019 for the Danish State Railways
    to replace the previous \u2018British Rail\u2019 typeface who looks like Helvetica
    Bold. \u2014 <cite>Claus Eggers S\xF8rensen: Danish Humanist Modernism at <a href=\"http://www.forthehearts.net/Danish_Humanist_Modernism\">
    forthehearts.net</a></cite></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Bo Linnemann [of Kontrapunkt]
    professed being influenced by Knud Engelhardt, the famous Danish architect who
    lived about 100 years ago. The guiding principle in all of Linnemann\u2019s work,
    accordingly, is legibility. Engelhardt used to open up glyphs such as A, M and
    N. Linnemann\u2019s face VIA for the Danish Railways (DSB) has inner spaces bigger
    than those of Helvetica, which was the face used previously by DSB. VIA\u2019s
    identity is in the lower case g, a neat feature found in more and more corporate
    typefaces these days. \u2014 <cite><a href=\"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/atypi01.html\">Luc

    Hamburg seems to use the Danish DSB font for its corporate identity. This would
    mean that the font is available outside the DSB, either for commercial purchase

    yet return any result. Maybe someone has got a hint? I'd really love to buy the

    typeface was developed. In the development I rebuilt all the characters in Fontlab.
    I made corrections on the Curve definitions and fitted elements from other fonts
    in it. The design of the fint consists mainly of three different source fonts.
    The \u201CVia DSB,\u201D \u201CDTL Argo,\u201D and \u201CLT Rotis\u2019. The font
    name \u203AEklekt\u2039 was chosen because the word \u2018eclectic\u2019 reflects
    the characteristics of the typeface. It means taking the best of everything. So
    it just did. This typeface taken all the best features of its source fonts and
    creates a unique font with lot\u2019s of character.\"</cite>"

    strongly inspired by the via from kontrapunkt.  The small \"g\", that's by the
    way just one of the greatest \"g\" ever made is and a arrow. The font Eklekta
    is a mix of total 4 different typefaces. The name \"Eklekta\" means, to take the
    best of all and merge into something new. That's exactly  what we did with this
    font. But beside the fact that we took elements from existing fonts, we spend
    a lot of work and energy in making a well design and drawn font that in it's self
    is quiet unique. I agree with you that this is not best practice, but in this
    case, the font is only used internally for the corporate design for the agency.
    It's <em> <strong>not</em> </strong> for sale or public available. \r\n\r\nWe
    just put together what we like a lot and shaped our own version from it. To have

    this...\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/91187\r\n\r\nLars, thank you for coming
    here to post that\r\nhonest response - I have to say I only expected\r\na reply
    to my private email to you outlining\r\nthe concern. Doing this in public will
    surely\r\nhelp more people make each other happier in\r\nthis case and in the
    future. Call me hopelessly\r\noptimistic!\r\n\r\nThat's said, it's still not OK.
    Meaning ideally\r\nsome steps should be taken, or at the very\r\nleast practices
    should change in the future.\r\n\r\nThe \"g\" is a special case in the Latin alphabet;\r\nmany
    people need help making it work. Maybe\r\nthis isn't what happened in your case
    - it sounds\r\nlike you were simply deeply inspired by it. And I\r\nagree that
    the font isn't a clone of the original(s).\r\nBut that does not excuse copying
    outlines. If you\r\ndid \"spend a lot of work and energy\" making some-\r\nthing
    (sufficiently) unique, you should have just\r\nspend a little bit more energy
    making a new \"g\".\r\nIt's really too cavalier swiping its outlines.  I do\r\nbelieve
    that inspiration is highly necessary; but\r\nthis practice isn't.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    saying that your design is only for internal\r\nuse doesn't excuse this. Via was
    only for internal\r\nuse too and look what happened! :-/  I also have to\r\nwonder
    how the other inspiration-fonts were used\r\nin the making of Eklekta.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not some sort of judge, and I only want to help,\r\nso here's what I recommend
    - it might be hard to\r\nswallow: make a new \"g\" yourself (it can look very\r\nclose);
    tell Kontrapunkt what happened; and give\r\nReinhard & Ostmann the new version,
    even if they\r\nprobably won't care (and wouldn't want to go the\r\ntrouble of
    replacing the existing version).\r\n\r\nGood luck, and again, thank you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
