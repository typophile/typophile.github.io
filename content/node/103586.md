body: "Hello,\r\nPoli is my second font, it's a 4 font complete sans serif family.
  It's a display typeface I guess. I wanted something elegant and crisp, something
  masculine and feminine at the same time. Poli inverses\_with some letters (c o d
  l p\u2026)\_the classical thickness of the font (downstrokes are commonly down,
  upstrokes are up).\r\nAs I'd like to release it  - so that I can begin another project
  - I'd like to ask here some critical advice...\r\nThank you,\r\nSerge\r\nhttp://www.serge-paulus.be/docs/poli.html"
