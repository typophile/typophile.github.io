  body: Thanks for both responses, Acadian is indeed pretty similar.  I looked through
    a newer Letraset catalogue and didn't see anything similar, or Marvin; Richard,
    if you happen to be at work next to the catalogue and think of this post, I'd
    love to hear.

    <a href=\"http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/south_park/\"><cite>South Park</cite></a>.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a character named Kenny who often gets killed in a humorous and grisly manner
    (only to be resurrected without explanation in the next episode). Whenever Kenny
    is killed, the following dialogue ensues between his friends:\r\n\r\n<strong>Stan</strong>:
    Oh my God! You killed Kenny!\r\n<strong>Kyle</strong>: You bastard!\r\n\r\nSorry
    about that.\r\n\r\nEdward"
