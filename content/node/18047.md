  body: What does the radioactive symbol have to do with their name? Nothing apparently.
    I would dump it, and start over completely. There are plenty of ideas to explore
    with the words "idea" and "factory" neither of which are expressed in the logo.
    Your design IS an improvement. But I think the idea itself doesn't make sense.

    and really think about the communications problem, not the execution.

    body: hey guys ! the problem is thats the owner-partners WANTS the radioactive
      symbol attached to a film reel, and the correct translation of "usina de ideias"
      to english is something like "power plant" not "factory" (sorry bout that) heheheh
      ! so, what do ya think ?

  body: Well I actually like the angle and movement of the old logo, but I like a
    simpler, more graphic approach. The 3-D thing doesn't work for me. I think the
    way you have shown the film, on the new logo, looks awkward. Keep working on it,
    and explore some options, I don't think it's done.

  body: "The US needs kerning a bit tighter, the first de also needs tightening (although
    that line is all a bit too small and loose). The USI don't have the same characteristics
    as the NA you might try to work in some of those characteristics. You could rotate
    the film icon so that the strip is parallel to the righthand vertical of the A
    and bring it down to align with the text block, it seems disconnected to me.\r\nTim"

    to my comments I was suggesting that you redraw some of the letters that you have
    used to give them some of the technical drawing, quirky modern feeling of the
    others (it is quite common to redraw some characters for a logo), sorry to have
    caused a confusion.\r\nTim"

  body: "I really don't like the S or I, but the U, N and A are advances although
    the area where the serif joins the U is a bit dark. The icon still seems disconnected
    to me, maybe it could provide the inspiration for the S and that would tie it
    in, you could also look at making the space between the core of the radioactive
    symbol and the \"arms\" similar to the weight of the type stroke. The alignment
    of the de id\xE9ias might be better aligning the upright of the d to the I although
    at small sizes it might be too small.\r\nTim"

  body: "first of, i think that is definitly the right decision to ditch the 3D-ness
    of your earlier sketches and I personally really like the film reel, but just
    as Tim says the icon seems completly disconnected from the type.\r\n\r\nI reckon,
    you should find an existing type that picks up the feeling/proportions of the
    icon and then you can always customise the font if you think its needed. \r\n\r\nLooking
    forward to the next instalment...\r\nSeb\r\n"

    eye however sees verticals thicker than horizontals - make optical adjustments. "
