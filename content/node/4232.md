  body: 'I was going to say the same thing, but I think it&#39;s something else. Notice
    the thick and thin strokes on the M and A. If it was Courier &#40;New or otherwise&#41;,
    the angled strokes should be the same thickness. I think it&#39;s some kind of
    &#34;letter quality&#34; inkjet or dot matrix font, stretched of course. <BR>
    <BR>Here it is unstretched: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33150.gif"
