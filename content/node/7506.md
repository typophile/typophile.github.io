  body: Andrij why the different height of the characters? Could you give more background
    on the firm. Being from Manhattan, USA it makes no sense to me.

  body: 'If your client is trying to create a single word, you should make it a single
    word. The lack of contrast in height makes it look unintentional. Try one of the
    following: &#40;1&#41; create higher ascention and just combine the words via
    word spacing, &#40;2&#41; lose the varied height completely, or &#40;3&#41; heighten
    the &#34;A&#34;, but not the &#34;C&#34;. <BR> <BR>Can you offer any explanation
    of what the company does? What kind of trading company? <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: Andrij much better balance to the letters but the A still bothers me. Its
    out of balance with the other characters. The high negitive space is my problem.
    Investigate making the balance more like the reverse N. One other nit pik you
    flattened the tops of the 3s and C but not the bottoms, looks awkward. In the
    A3 the bottom of the 3 is swooping upward noticeably.
