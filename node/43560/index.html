> Users must give credit to Latinotype™ as a registered trademark and the holder of copyright for the font


EULA point No. 6 can be read in two ways:

1. (the strict interpretation): In every use, let's say on a business card, you must credit Latinotype™ (printing the foundry name on the card) and indicate Latinotype™ as the copyright holder. Obviously this as impractical as it is illogical. I'd be genuinely surprised if this is the correct interpretation of the EULA. Nobody is going to put a foundry name on a poster, packaging, or title sequences. :|

2. (the logical interpretation) When Latinotype is mentioned in print, in a colophon, in some liner notes, please indicate the ™ and © whenever appropriate.

Latinotype™  does not appear to have been registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office, but maybe it has been registered with the Chilean PTO maybe? 

In the U.S., ™ can be used at any time, even without federal registration, to put others on notice that you are claiming rights in the mark.
® is used when a Trademark has been officially registered after going through the required steps with the USPTO.</div>

If BJ's interpretation is right, the clause should be rewritten to be clear about that. Guessing is not a wise thing to do in legal matters.

Sorry Miguel, at least one sale lost due to an over protective EULA.</div>

As for embedding...it's really just an issue of practicality for a designer. I want to be able to start a project and choose the typeface suitable for the project based on the LOOK of the typeface rather than the intricacies of the EULA.

But, damn...that's a fun typeface. I'll probably be getting it anyways ;o)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A good case for a clear EULA in more than one language to avoid ambiguity. #6 is very confusing and if interpreted literally, it is a great way to self-promote but logistically difficult to have accommodated. Those who ignore EULAs will ignore this one as well.

I like the PR spin here:<em>Proceeds from this limited-time offer will support the development of the complete Cadena family</em>. It may be fair to say that proceeds from any sales of fonts support the development of future fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think guifa’s shortening of point 6 in the EULA made it more ambiguous than the original:

<cite>6.- El usuario de este software de fuentes Latinotype™ se comprometa a dar créditos a Latinotype™ como marca registrada y dueños del copyright de Latinotype™ como único distribuidor de las fuentes y sus nombres, sin importar los créditos de sus referentes, diseñadores y/o creadores que se muestren en el sitio.</cite>

I read this as, “The user of this Latinotype™ font software is obliged to give credit to Latinotype™, as a registered trademark and owners of the copyright Latinotype™, as the sole distributor of the fonts and their names, regardless of credits to references, designers, and/or creators as given on the site”.

Meaning that, regardless of who the web site has as the designer or creator of a font, users are required to credit Latinotype™ as the distributor and copyright holder of the font, rather than the individual designer; <em>not</em> that you are obliged to always credit the foundry, every time you use the font.

[I’m not sure what exactly they mean by <em>sus referentes</em>, though—guifa?]

Would the more learned Spanish-speakers agree with such an interpretation?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, it wasn't meant to be a full translation, just a quick point-by-point you can do this or can't do that.  Although I think the intent of #6 is to say when crediting, please credit it like exactly as shown with the TM symbol as opposed to crediting the individual designer (like Janus indicated), it's not the most clear thing.  (Aside for Janus: «sus referentes» in this case means more or less references, or perhaps "points/places of reference".  I would take this to mean the web-design credits, for instance)

Kegler makes a good point about having EULAs in multiple languages, but in this case it really needs to be rewritten for both English and Spanish users' sakes.

The problem is that the "y" (and) is not really well defined as to what it's joining, it could be creating a second object of the verb «give credits» or it could be adding a second object under the preposition «como» (as) or it could be a second obligation creating a sentence fragment.  Unfortunately all three areas sound odd given that the second «como» (<em>as</em> the only distributor) doesn't really seem to be well attached. Janus assumed an additional «y» (and) with his comma placement but it's not there or something else to indicate it's position in the hierarchy.  And in any case, it sounds weird to need to identify Latinotype the only distributor of the <em>names</em> of the fonts...  It seems to me like a lot of words and phrases got mixed up.

For anyone who is interested, [[http://www.elahorcado.net/random/eula.html/index.html|I broke down #6]] with side-by-side English translations.

Again I support Miguel Latino Type as I have paid full price for 2 of his typefaces, $50 for MOTE

I really love MOTE, which is no longer on his site, though I guess it will be the uppercase version of Cadena Heavy?

Looking at all this I have to say I don't really think the 'point 6' really applies if you look at where his fonts are being used and that he is celebrating where they have been used. So sorry Miguel.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the tip, Haley. When I first discovered Typophile, Miguel was here very often, and amazed everyone with creations like <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/6215">Garadot</a>. Go, Miguel! Nice to see you around here again. :-)

<em>sorry, I hate it when Spanish-speakers call fonts “fuentes” which actually means either fountain or source</em>

guifa, I studied graphic design in Argentina and typefaces were called "tipografías" or "fuentes tipográficas" by our professors... And this was in the 80s, mind you, before everyone had a personal computer over there! Here's a Spanish Wikipedia page that talks about the use of both terms:

<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuente_tipográfica">Tipo de letra</a>

You're correct as far as the Real Academia Española not listing the terms <a href="http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=fuente">fuente</a> or <a href="http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=tipograf%EDa">tipografía</a> as equivalents of the English "typeface"... which I have to admit really bugs me! But language is a living thing, and changes faster than dictionary editors can keep up, I'm afraid. :-)

<em>Latinotype. The latin alphabet, on latino hands.</em>

Miguel, some friendly advice from a bilingual admirer: Your slogan would sound much better to an English speaker if it was "The latin alphabet, <strong>in</strong> latino hands."

Cheers,
Ricardo

		<div class="commentbody">Ricardo, está muy bien la aclaración sobre los términos:

En Chile hablamos así:

Fuente is Typeface.

Tipografía could be Typeface and/or Letterpress (impresión tipográfica)

Diagramación o composición es Typography

Tipógrafo (typographer) as typedesigner (diseñador de tipos)

is a really confusing for the students (and for some designers also)
