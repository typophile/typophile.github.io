body: "I am the associate pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of Ukiah, CA and
  was brought on to work with youth and families and revitalize the congregation\u2019s
  aging population. Step #1 was get a website with a reasonable, simple design, and
  a logo to suit it.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt was posted and critiqued here:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/30295\r\n\r\nTherefore,
  you may want to take a minute to look over some of the conversation from before
  if you are new to it.  Needless to say, \"Hire a professional\" is a recommendation
  that I have already considered.\r\n\r\nHere is my second attempt at a church logo.
  \ Here I chose two main images: a cross and a grape vine.  The cross is included
  for obvious reasons.  The grape vine is both a scriptural allusion (Jesus likens
  himself to a grape vine, and his followers are the branches who bear fruit), and
  a reference to the agricultural industry of the area, in which there are a lot of
  vineyards.\r\n\r\n(Side note: I don't think that one necessarily needs a cross to
  convey Christianity, but I have had that discussion with my boss and others in the
  church, and a church logo without a cross is too outside the box right now).\r\n\r\nAs
  I said before, please let me know what you think with frankness and forthrightness.
  I am not a professional designer, but I am very teachable."

  body: I only have a second, but I generally like it (much, much better than your
    last attempt). My two suggestions are to work on the curves of the curling top
    of the grape vine (I assume you're using a vector illustration program like Illustrator
    or Freehand), as they're a bit abrupt now, not as smooth as they should be, and
    to get rid of that thick black stroke around everything. You might try putting
    a white stroke around the grape vine to break apart the cross appropriately, but
    it may work fine without one.

  body: Check out this book "The Cross as Symbol & Ornament" by Johannes Troyer, Westminster
    Press, 1961 - if you can not find it a Library try Booksold.com (add all). Your
    cross is in need of better proportions and needs to be less stiff - the stroke
    must go on your grape vine, it is just too heavy.

  body: "Hm, it looks a bit 'clip-arty', if you know what I mean. It could be the
    black stroke or the general style of drawing, but it's a bit too cartoonish for
    my taste.\r\nI think a logo should be a bit more to the point, without too much
    confusion. A bit more iconic, so to speak.\r\nHave you--for example--considered
    what will happen if the logo is printed in black&white/greyscale or with a raster
    (will the difference in colors still be visible), or what happens when it's drastically
    reduced in size, etc.?"

  body: "Yes, it looks much better without the lines.  Do you think it makes it look
    less cartoonish?  Also, I had the vine interact a little bit more.  And I ordered
    the book.  Finally, these images scale better than the horrid black lines.  Any
    new thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fpcu logo 22 jan 2007

  - body: I think the "cartoony" effect you're seeing is caused by the scale issues.  Whole
      bunches of grapes are typically not the same size as a single grape leaf --
      except, of course, unless they're champagne grapes :)

    heavy, interweaving the vine and cross pulls together the elements. The cross-bar,
    to my eye, is a bit too high on the vertical. Do you intend to use type with the
    image?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I think the clip art effect is caused by the fact that there are too many
    colours, and too many bright colours. Pick one item you want to stand out (the
    vine, the grapes, the leaves, the cross) and make the colour of it contrast with
    the rest. At the moment, all elements are competing for my attention. Also, watch
    your curves. They're looking lumpy.\r\n\r\nI actually liked the direction of your
    original logo (from the previous thread) better than the vine, but of course,
    it's up to you.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "All your leaves are the same pattern, so make them different to add more
    interest. The vine feels loose and floppy. I like the darker green,but not the
    electric green. Consider making the cross thicker and short.\r\n\r\nSketch vines
    and crosses until you get a reasonable balance between the two.\r\n\r\ngenerally,
    you should start off in black and white so you can focus on composition."

    and focus on the colors later. Colors are a distraction, when you need to establish
    good contrast and composition. :)"

  body: If you weigh the use of the mark verses a commercial logo, then its fine the
    way it is. It doesn't need to be accurate or realistic. It just has to convey
    the point and I feel it does.

    to target and the logo that you made reminds me of those horrible textbooks we
    had to read in Sunday school. \r\nNot only is Alaskan's idea beautifully simple
    and elegant, it's also very easy to use in a variety of applications. I can just
    picture it etched into glass somewhere.\r\nIt's also the opposite of what I would
    expect from a church logo. It looks high-end without being too designer or stuffy.\r\n\r\n-Scott"

  body: I agree completely with Spire. With the outline, the leaf is too harsh compared
    to the organic lines of the vine. The serrated edges on the leaf will definitely
    not look good at small sizes either.

    denomination of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe drawing style of the leaf doesn't match
    the drawing style of the vines. The outline is the reason for this. Maybe extend
    the black under the vines outside the cross, sort of as a shadow. It's kind of
    hard to explain, but if you've ever seen Mike Mignola's (Hellboy) comics, take
    a look at what he does when a detail is on the border between light and shadow.\r\n\r\n
