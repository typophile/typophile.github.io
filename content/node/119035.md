  Im having trouble with a specific font letter, i get two different types of I\xB4s(seen
  in image) i\xB4ve tried to edit the font but it all seemed normal to me. It\xB4s
  strange, generally the F should not get in the space of the upper part of the I
  and sometimes it does.Can\xB4t really understand why and i kinda need that I loose.
  Any thoughts? "

  body: "Fonts these days contain something aikin to programs or codes that can be
    used to tell a layout application to replace one or more glyphs with glyphs that
    look different. In this case, the code in the font tells the layout application
    to replace the letters FI by a glyph that contains both of them drawn together
    (this is called a \"ligature\"), replace the I by a different I for looks (this
    is called a \"stylistic alternate\" or part of a \"stylistic set\") or possibly
    replace the I specifically when it comes after an F (this is called a \"contextual
    alternate\"). \r\n\r\nMost layout applications have functions to switch these
    on or off, tell us what you're using and we can help tell you where to find that
    function."
