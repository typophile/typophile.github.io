  small as possible, only the fonts that are really needed for websites and programs
  that run on the mac to avoid crashes.\r\nThe rest i want to activate with fontexplorer.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a list or something of fonts that can't be thrown away?\r\nOr which folders
  are save to clean and which not?"

  body: "If you want a truly minimal /System/Library/Fonts folder and do not require
    CJK support, you <em> can </em>  remove everything but the following.\r\n\r\nHelvetica.dfont\r\nKeyboard.dfont\r\nLastResort.dfont\r\nLucidaGrande.dfont\r\n\r\nHowever,
    you should probably also leave the following alone as many applications won't
    work properly without them:\r\n\r\nGeneva.dfont\r\nHelveLTMM\r\nHelvetica LT MM\r\nHelveticaNeue.dfont\r\nMonaco.dfont\r\nSymbol.dfont\r\nTimes
    LT MM\r\nTimes.dfont\r\nTimesLTMM\r\n\r\nNote that if this list is specific to
    Leopard. Other fonts may also be required under other versions of MacOS. Since
    the above list includes no CJK fonts, you may run into serious problems if you
    ever switch input methods.\r\n\r\nAnything which is *not* stored in /System/Library/Fonts
    is pretty much guaranteed to be safely removable.\r\n\r\nOn an unrelated rant,
    I still can't fathom what possessed Apple to make Helvetica a required font under
    OS X. That has to be one of the stupidest decisions they've ever made.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
