body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve chosen Avenir as the font for heads and subheads for
  a book geared toward CEOs &#40;the cover uses Avenir&#41;. And I&#39;m looking for
  a good companion font.  Does anyone have any ideas? I like Wilson as well but I
  need a font family that contains a bold italic. Any help you can provide is greatly
  appreciated. Thanks!

  body: I really like the suggestions, however I need a font with a bold italic in
    the family. The Sabon NEXT does have a bold italic but I can&#39;t afford it.
    Thanks...

  body: What is your budget? How many weights do you want &#40;4? regular, italic,
    bold, bold italic? more?&#41;? Let me know, and I&#39;ll see what I can find that
    is within your price range.

  body: Hi Dan, <BR> <BR>Thanks so much for the assistance...Yeah I need four &#40;regular,
    italic, bold, bold italic&#41; at least. Possibly a small caps too. I really don&#39;t
    want to go over $40 per font.

  body: Hi Tamara, <BR> <BR>Wow $40 per font, you can buy almost anything &#40;from
    us at least&#41;.  <BR> <BR>My first recommendation, if you like Sabon NEXT, would
    be the original Sabon. They are two different designs, but the original Sabon
    was designed by Jan Tschichold, and is pretty comprehensive. Sabon has many, many
    weights, and separate Small Caps sets available, so you certainly can get a bold
    italic. You can even get a bold italic small caps/osf font! All weights cost 22
    Dollars or Euros, plus tax. The regular weight is even availble as an OpenType
    font

  body: Thanks, Dan <BR> <BR>I was leaning toward Sabon for the companion font. However,
    I&#39;ve changed the type on the cover from Avenir to Agenda Semibold Condensed  &#40;the
    title is really long and I needed something that would allow me to bump up the
    size a bit &#41;.  <BR> <BR>Do you think Sabon could work well with Agenda?

  body: That depends on which Agenda you mean. On MyFonts.com, I found two very different
    looking typefaces named Agenda. The sans serif Agenda from Font Bureau would still
    pair well with Sabon, I think. The other Agenda from URW&#43;&#43; I&#39;m less
    sure about. That might call for a more robust serif face? <BR> <BR>BTW, Avenir
    NEXT has a semibold condensed weight of its own. The revised/expanded Avenir NEXT
    is a much better family than the original Avenir, but it might be out of your
    budget range
