  body: "It's very feminine, in a \"Sex and the City\" / women's deodorant sort of
    way. To me it says \"women who want to have fun on their terms\" which might not
    be what you're going for, depending on if the logo is to attract women or men.\r\n\r\n

  body: The letters don't really connect. The outgoing angle of the first "e" doesn't
    match the incoming angle of "l", same with "l" and the second "e", as well as
    the second "e" and "c". At the very least, the strokes need a lot of fine tuning.
