body: Can anyone help me identify the type face being used throughout Martha Stewart&#39;s
  new publication, &#34;Everyday Foods&#34;? The same sans serif font is used in light,
  medium and bold weights, as well as in small caps. Very understated, very classic,
  with a few quirks. It&#39;s  similar to &#40;but not&#41; Advert and Praxis. Got
  any ideas? For more examples, go to <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/everydayfoods"

    Gothic, a proprietary font family they designed  <BR>for MS a few years ago.

    target="_blank">Found it.</a> Looks like the MS version is changed a bit &#40;single-
    <BR>storey  &#39;g&#39;, shorter overhang on the &#39;a&#39;&#41; but it&#39;s
    essentially <BR>the same design.

  body: Thanks, Stephen. I had actually looked at Font Bureau&#39;s site and overlooked
    the newspaper fonts section. I&#39;ll likely use it as it, but I think I prefer
    the single-storery &#34;g&#34;. Thanks again for your guidance.
