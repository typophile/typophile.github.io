  body: If you ever need to find similar designs, we have a <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/wide_grotesque/?&sample_text=HOME%20DAY%20BIRGER%20ET%20MIKKELSEN&sample_size=18">FontCase</a>
    for that genre as well. Unfortunately as FontShop doesn't carry Berthold we couldn't
    add this one.
