body: On Latin script at least, emphasis is given in text with italic and bold. I
  know that those don't apply for all languages, yet it seems that limits on technology
  kind of forces the same thing on other scripts. What other means uses other scripts
  to indicate emphasis? How those translate to HTML, text processors and stuff? Which
  scripts actually uses bold and/or italic for it?

    verbally, and contextually, and maybe more. Verbally one can  write such things
    as, \" \u2026he said, emphatically.\"   Typographically, in addition to what you
    and John Hundson have mentioned, there's also underlining, all caps, change of
    font, surrounding the word or phrase with something like asterisks, isolation
    (putting  lots of space above and below the material), etc.  Contextually, some
    phraseologies can be stronger that others..\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean
    by \"limits of technology\" or why these would vary with the medium such as being

    any [number of] vowels, so although the need for Italics is not obviated, the
    need for emphasizing by style-change nicely is. Our Bold situation though is the
    same as in Latin.\r\n\r\n* Similarly we have floating elongation and question
    marks.\r\n\r\nIn Georgian (which is a monocameral script) emphasis is often implemented
    via a full-height style (reminiscent of all-caps in Latin).\r\n\r\nBTW John, you
    forgot your favorite example: Ge'ez's use of red for emphasis.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Cyrillic and Greek both use bold and italics. Greek italics is straightforward
    (I assume its forms are copied from the familiar Latin italics), but Cyrillic
    has a number of idiosyncrasies. An italic /t '\u0442', for example, looks like
    '<em>\u0442</em>' -- and it depends on your viewing software what <em>that</em>
    looks like for you!\r\n\r\nThe concept of \"Italics\" is hard, if not impossible,
    to translate to other scripts. Chinese, for example, only uses Bold and Light
    fonts, although I have seen my part of 'italicized' (through Word) and underlined
    Chinese text. Then again, I'm pretty sure the Chinese script has more subtleties
    to it than my inexperienced (round) eyes can discern.\r\n\r\nUppercase is another
    thing simply not applicable to non-European fonts. Uppercase Hebrew? Uppercase
    Arabic? Uppercase Mayan hieroglyphs? That's like asking for an 'uppercase' digit."

    I suspect that since most implementations only supports bold, italic and underline
    perhaps some script are more forced to use those instead of what is more appropriate
    and elaborate. There's still a lot dedicated support for Asian and Middle East
    languages of course, but I'm worried about the usage of HTML stuff that is supposed
    to give semantic emphasis (&lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;), yet some script may ignore
    that and only use them based on their default look. That's the very reason the
    &lt;u&gt; element was added back on HTML5, as it was used on Chinese for indicating
    proper names (the current definition of the element is pretty awkward trying to
    make it having a more general semantic meaning).\r\n\r\nI believe that some Asian
    scripts empathize by placing dots over the characters. Not sure how is typed commonly,
    yet it can be archived with combining diacritics. [[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#emphasis-marks|A
    current CSS3 draft proposal]] has a property (with no kind of implementation at
    the time of this writing) that adds dots over characters, along other symbols
    by default I don't know if they are used or if have a different meaning (circle,
    double-circle, triangle, sesame).\r\n\r\nI believe that Arabic empathize by placing
    an over-line in the text. It is supported in CSS, yet I don't remember much support
    in word processors."

  body: "Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have a traditional method of emphasis as well
    as Western-derived bold, oblique, and underlining. When text is typeset vertically
    a character can have a small dot or lachrymal brush stroke on the right side.
    This serves much the same purpose as italics for emphasis in modern Latin-alphabet
    typesetting. It\u2019s not seen very much when text is typeset horizontally, however
    it\u2019s still possible. For Japanese there\u2019s the likelihood of clashing
    with ruby (furigana) annotations, so that the two don\u2019t usually cooccur with
    the same text. The Wikipedia article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_typographic_symbols\">Japanese
    typographic symbols</a> notes their use.\r\n\r\nAnother emphasis mark in Japanese
    is the \u7C73\u5370 <em>komejirushi</em> or \u2018rice symbol\u2019: \u203B. It\u2019s
    named after its resemblance to the character meaning \u2018rice\u2019: \u7C73.
    Although it\u2019s often described as being like an asterisk, it\u2019s actually
    more like a bullet because it doesn\u2019t have a cross-reference function. Instead
    it appears before text that is supposed to be particularly important.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThis
    is a short example paragraph. This short paragraph contains some ordinary text.
    The ordinary text in this paragraph is not terribly important.\r\n\r\n\u203B This
    line of text is particularly important and the reader is advised to pay attention
    to it.\r\n\r\nThis paragraph is ordinary like the first example paragraph. Once
    again, this text is not deserving of any special emphasis.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    not sure if this is used in Chinese and Korean typesetting, but I think I\u2019ve
    seen it at least in some Korean flyers around town in Vancouver and Honolulu."
