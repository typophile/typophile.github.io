body: "Urbana wants to be a contemporary sans-serif typeface inspired in the traditional
  lettering seen in one of the most popular, massive transportation mediums available
  in Bogot\xE1 (Colombia): \"busetas\" (small city buses). A mixture of influences
  reminiscent of modernism, hand lettering, cluttered spaces and improvisation are
  the source of its characteristic forms. Urbana wants to save space and catch the
  reader's attention at the same time. All of your comments are very welcome.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/muestra

  body: "C\xE9sar, te debo unos comentarios m\xE1s detallados, pero puedo decir: es
    una tipograf\xEDa preciosa, solo noto (en un relevamiento veloz) dos cuestiones
    referentes a la contraforma:\r\n\r\n1. en la palabra \"ahorro\" creo que el espaciado
    entre las dos \"r\" deber\xEDa de ser un poquit\xEDn mayor... si comparo el espacio
    \"rr\" con el espacio \"ro\" me da como que faltara un poco de blanco en el primero.\r\n\r\n2.
    algo similar me ocurre con las palabras \"transmilenio\" y \"TRANSMILENIO\" referido
    a las \"s\" y \"S\" en ambas me da la sensaci\xF3n de una separaci\xF3n apenitas
    mayor de la necesaria, como que las veo un poco separadas de la palabra.\r\n\r\nY
    3. que lo veo ahora hay algo de eso en la palabra \"caos\" como que me queda la
    \"ca\" por un lado y el \"os\" por el otro, es apenas tambi\xE9n.\r\n\r\nLa seguimos
    por aqu\xED o por all\xE1! abrazo!"

  body: I really like you 'o' & 'a'. 'e' too. The cut on your r seems too arbitrary
    & not in keeping with the design. Also they way they set together 'rr' also looks
    a little odd. Your lower case is stronger & more compelling than the Upper Case.
    I think you have a good strong piece of work here. I suggest that you keep working
    on it for a bit longer & then start submitting it to foundries. It's really good
    looking.

  body: Actually, I disagree. English is probably the second language of more Typophile
    users than first language. But not all second language English speakers are as
    strong in their English as others. If a thread is mostly in Spanish, German, or
    Dutch (etc.), I think that is just fine. Typophile is for everyone. As you can
    see, some users are posting in English here, too. If two Spanish speakers can
    communication better here in Spanish, that is OK. No oone should feel left out
    and not post because of their English abilitiues.

  body: "Fair enough, but that could always devide the thread into two (or more) camps;
    the native speakers and the english community. A Spanish thread will propably
    mostly attract spanish speaking people. Where an English thread can reach a very
    large group of people, giving more input and getting out more result. \r\n\r\nI
    think it'd be just 'open minded' to include everyone here on Typophile. My english
    is also far from perfect, but you can understand me. ;-)\r\nIf I see a foreign
    thread that I can't read, I will not involve myself. That would just be a pitty.
    But hey, you're right; Typophile is for everyone.\r\n\r\n\xAE"

  body: "Me gusta esto mucho! Okeydokey...the MNVW letters seem too flat/wide in the
    joins. In the diagonal letters it is always a balance between making the joints
    too wide, or making the joints too dark. Wide joins can be part of the style,
    but here you have a mixed style. The A join is so wide that is has a very big
    \"trap\" at the apex. The MNVW, are just wide. Consider adding this trap to the
    MNVW too, or solving it by making the joins narrower. \r\n\r\nAlso, the diagonal
    of the N is too thin to me. Consider making the diagonal thicker, and if needed,
    the verticals a little thinner.\r\n\r\nSorry, no tengo palabras de tipographia

  body: "Very nice typeface! Is it up for sale?\r\n\r\nI have to say about English
    vs other languages: English was the original language here at typophile and all
    posts should be kept in English. If there is interest for a Spanish Typophile
    that should be on a different url (www.typophile.(something)). Considering the
    people that only speak Spanish are not going be able to take part in any English
    threads and vice versa there will only be a divide. I myself am Norwegian and
    English is definetly not my first language. I have many gramatical mistakes in
    my posts but that doesn't stop me. There is not one person in here that's gonna
    judge you for trying to write in english. People are just happy to have a mix
    of people in here with different backgrounds. That's what makes Typophile great.
    Having said that; there are a lot of people in this world who only speak spanish
    and it would be an idea to make a Spanish site for them (sooner or later it will
    definetly have to be a Chinese site as well). The Spanish speaking Typophiliacs
    can then decide whether to post at the english site or the spanish site depending
    on the relevance of the topic for the different groups. The community would not
    separate but just be more organized. Posters that speak both fluent Spanish and
    English would still post and translate anything of importance on both sites.\r\nMaybe
    I should start up a Norwegian/Scandinavian Typophile division...? Nahhh We are
    only about 20 million people up North (Danes Swedes, Norwegians and the few Finnish
    that still speak Swedish). I'll stick to the .com site;-)"
