As a type designer a don't like the aproach of using uncommon symbols.

As a designer i don't like the bolder or squer sheva that makes the text look not good.

Kehos (Chabd) uses an asterisk.

Kehos USA follows Rabbi Zalman Henna, while Kehos Israel follows the Minchat Shai.

According to Rabbi Shmuel Rabin of Torah, the view of Rabbi Zalman Henna produces more shva-nas than the view of the Minchat Shai.

Those that mark the shva-na with a bolder shva, as you did in the your sample, follow which shita view?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the hollow circle is going to be hard to harmonize with the other nikkud. 

For the kamatz katan, that is sometimes done with a line with a dot under it (like a patach with a hirik below). You could use the "T" form for the regular kamatz and the line with a dot below for the kamatz katan. This would keep the same design elements, so it would not stick out so much. I think some siddurim already do this, but I think they make the kamatz katan symbol also bigger, which I wouldn't do. The kamatz katan is relatively rare, and I don't think the difference has to be so prominent.

How about for the shva na, having a dot above and a short horizontal line below, indicating some pronunciation? I haven't tried this, but it might work, and would be more harmonious with the current design elements in the nikkud. 

Another possibility is a dot above and a short vertical line below, or two short vertical lines, one over the other. There is a danger of mixing it up with the dreaded meteg, though :) Also you might have a space problem. I think the horizontal line below is a more promising direction.

William, this a nice graphic idea, but it is conceptually wrong, since the "pattach-hirik" combination you speak of is actually the original Tiberian way of writing a kamatz. The combined shape (a line with with "droplet", or a "T") we know as kamatz today seems to be a later evolution (by the early printers perhaps). 

As I said before, there is really no allowance under the Tiberian nikkud for these differentiations and, although I know some people want to see these differences represented graphically, it is an unfortunate development form the purely typographic point of view. Making up for the lack of grammar knowledge by screwing with this venerable and very laconic system is just sad.

I also think that including a kamatz koton in Unicode was a mistake. </div>

I advocate that it should be done also for the shva-na, and the shva-nach, just like the vav is encoded twice.

The shva should remain, when not differentiated.

Similarly, there should be an encoding also made for dagesh kal and dagesh chazak, with a special symbol for either, in addition to an ordinary dagesh.

Similarly, there should be an encoding also made for the vowels which are kal and chazak, with a special symbol for either, in addition to an ordinary vowel.

If this occurs, and its supported by font makers, with 5 years Jewish teachers and students will learn these rules.

		<div class="commentbody">Raphael, I am not sure whom you are addressing with the "mistake" question.

But let me pose the following hypothetical question: How would you people feel if someone proposed (nay, implemented out of whole cloth) a change into the Latin alphabet structure by adding two versions for, say a vowel "a" (one for short vowel, one for long vowel)? The reasoning would be to help immigrants learn how to pronounce English better...

I bet all of you would agree this would be insane. Well, the same applies to these new typographic aberrations with variant qomatzim, shevaim, and daggeshim! I know some people WANT them, and I understand the commercial realities, but I think it would be FAR better to promote learning of grammar over this wanton destruction of such a beautiful system.</div>

2. Even for a narrow usage, it would require a major typographic effort to create something that really works. As things stands now, some guy in some publishing house (I think it called "Simanim", not really sure) came up with this "brilliant" idea of using fat square dots for sheva na and daggesh chazak, and an extended line on the komazt katan, and now this ugliness is being seriously discussed on a typographic forum!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Baruch, I think your implementation of the kamatz katan as I mentioned—perhaps others have already done it—doesn't look half bad. Your sheva na looks too weird, as does your dagesh kal. My concept, which is different than the philosophy now, is that the difference between the sheva na and nach should be slight, you can mistake one for the other, and have to look closely to differentiate. You could just discretely make the sheva na with square dots, but NOT big and ugly. By the way, you could also use the patach-hirik look as the normal kamatz and the "T" one for the kamatz katan...

The point is, that in a siddur, if a person wants to learn the pronunciation, they are going to have many times going over the same text, and these "instructional" variations don't have to shout at the reader, so long as they are noticeable when he or she looks closely.   

Raphael, that's my point about the kamatz katan also. It's true that kol and chochma are very common words, but there really aren't that many which are common, so flagging them very discretely will be a way for people to learn them, without messing up the look of the nikkud, as Baruch says. 

Baruch, the problem with your argument is that you can also say to people like me, who struggle without nikkud, or those who are totally unable to sound out words without them: go learn your Hebrew! Text with nikkud look pretty ugly in any case, if you ask me, compared to straight text with Hebrew letters.  

An injunction to learn Hebrew would be good advice, but would not address what is likely to remain a problem in the diaspora for a long time. </div>

You might have missed my point, I did not even for a second suggest that such a system should actually be implemented in a regular-purpose text with <cite>taamim</cite> and <cite>nikkud</cite>. I was simply answering Raphael's point about a hypothetical specialized phonetic text. My illustration was intended to show the KIND of approach that would be needed EVEN for such a purpose – that a NEW system with clear differentiation between the marks would have to be invented. For the general audience (and certainly for people that are having trouble with the language) there is really no need for any of these grammatical nuances to be graphically represented. 

gohebrew: <cite>"Why not keep everything as it was for centuries?"</cite>
My point exactly – leave the damn thing alone :) All the "time-tested" stuff you site is pure nonsense – these are all very recent inventions. (The Kehoth siddur type approach is not really the subject of my derision, since it doesn't feature the stupid new komatz koton and dagesh hozok).

William: 
<cite>"Text with nikkud look pretty ugly in any case, if you ask me, compared to straight text with Hebrew letters."</cite>

I guess if you feel this way, you would not be troubled if this system was further eroded by featuring two kinds of dots of slightly different shape (a typographic horror). I, needless to say, strongly disagree. I truly believe the Tiberian system of <cite>nikkud</cite> to be absolutely stunningly beautiful, and I hate seeing it messed with.

Your "forget the whole thing" about adding distinctions has an appeal. Yet honestly I don't find those distinctions as for example executed in the Koren Siddur look worse than the regular ones, and in fact are helpful.  </div>

By "educational purposes", I refer to the classes in Christian or Cathlic Bible schools, Hebrew school, and intelligent Israeli schools that teach Hebrew Grammar.

All Bible and nikkud-based Mishnah, Talmud etc. is digital, and costs little or nothing, as it is public domain.

A teacher presents the same text, in the same font side by side. One side doesn't have the shva-na marked. One side does. He or she explains why that is. He shows examples. The student understands. Instead of being ignorant about shva-na, as most people are, in a few generations most people will now about a shva-na like a comma or period.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am a Jew from the diaspora, and most of my Hebrew knowledge is from religious school and the siddur. I would not normally comment on Hebrew typography, but because I have a need for phonetic marks, my perspective might be useful. 

The qamats qatan is a very useful mark for those who do not speak Hebrew fluently. A special mark for the sh'va na is not so important because the rules for pronouncing it are very predictable (elementary students learn these rules in their first year of Hebrew school).

I have seen styles 1 and 2 used together in a text, one indicating the qamats gadol the other indicating the qamats qatan. I have also seen a curved version for the qamats qatan like style 4. Style 3 will definitely confuse non-Israelis and students.

I realy don't like the SIMANIM method of distinguishing these nikudim, i think they are ugly from a dasign point of view and incorrect from a typographical point of view.

mimiking him, means taking his system and making it into a standared.
I realize that as the first one to add this functionality to an open type font, it might lead to a standared, and that i don't want to do.

some might disagree about doing it at all at any level, others disagree on doing it on an OT level, but if we are allready doing it, we should come to an agreement of the best way of indicating these grammer distictions</div>

The dagesh chazak is harder. A larger dot won't work with most fonts. And distinguishing between a square and a circle (regardless of ugliness) won't work at small point sizes.

I'm inclined to leave the dagesh chazak.

Regarding mileil, again the use of the meteg is of course wrong, but everyone does it and people understand it. That seems to be the most typographically acceptable way of indicating it.</div>

It's whether the last (milra) or penultimate syllable is emphasized. My impression is that Ashkenazi, as spoken by Hassidim, under the influence of Yiddish gets this regularly wrong, by "official" grammatical standards. Ashkenazi shifts the emphasis to the the first syllable. SHAbas instead of shaBAT  So much for "sacred" pronunciation. 

Also note the table of traditional national variations in Hebrew pronunciation in the first link.

Thank you for the links, and for the explanations.


>>  Ashkenazi, as spoken by Hassidim, ...

This is true by most Chassidic groups.

Chabad-Lubavitch is mainly made up of Baalei Tshuva, people who became chassidic Jews from non-chassidic backgrounds. Those Chabad-Lubavitch chassidic Jews in Israel do not speak Hebrew, or even pray/study, like other chassidic or heredi non-chassidic Jews, in an Ashkenazic dialect. These Sephardic dialect speaking Jews number more than half of the Chabad-Lubavitch chassidic Jews in Israel. 

As the rate of Baalei Tshuva increase rapidly more in Israel than in the Diaspora, it is likely that there will be more Chabad-Lubavitch chassidic Jews speaking with a Sephardic dialect, and not speaking Yiddish.

In America, most Chabad-Lubavitch chassidic Jews are Askenazic. I for example come from a Reform Judaism family, and changed my way of speaking, praying, and learning, to that of an Askenazic dialect, because I am an Askenazic Jew.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I face the issue of the kamatz katan both as a typographer and as a type designer. I agree with Baruch in that the patach with a dot underneath is, indeed, the way the kamatz was written in the Aleppo and Leningrad codices, thereby putting it off-limits for sue as a kamatz katan. I have seen it done, but I believe it’s plain wrong. We’re not free to do what we wish, we have to explore precedents; otherwise, we simply add confusion. But I disagree with Baruch’s remark about the inclusion in the Unicode of kamatz katan (and hataf kamatz katan) being a mistake, for the reasons stated by Raphael. Both appear with sufficient regularity in siddur texts alone to justify their presence in fonts. 

I think we came up with a perfectly tradition-based, workable kamatz katan in the Milon font. It is a kamatz with an extended center bar, sufficient to be recognized immediately for what it is, without resorting to a bold character or other typographically obnoxious solutions. When the book was in progress, I shared it with Raphael, who thought the difference wouldn’t be noticeable, but we now have the evidence of over 150,000 satisfied users, including a large number of rabbis and other learned types. Feel free to judge for yourself: http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/Mahzor.KolNidrei.pdf

In the book linked above, we did not include the sh’va na, nor did we differentiate dagesh kal from dagesh hazak. We did use the patach g’nuvah, which is simply a typesetting issue, though I question its sense when used with ayin—what does it mean? I realize, as most of you do, that one can descend into a perilous realm of hair splitting, adding symbols that are outside the Tiberian sources, but are, rather, the product of latter-day khokhma. (“Rabbi Hutzpis on one foot? Big deal, I can recite the entire Torah on just three toes!”) The question in litugical Hebrew is which paytanim used which nikkudot—if any, and how early they were applied. Without some sense of historical application, one might come to the conclusion that everything should be typeset in the International Phonetic Alphabet. There’s great virtue in simplicity—you either know, or you don’t know—and if you don’t know, you can learn.

However, I recognize that for some, especially Jews who are from Persia or some Arabic-speaking lands, nikkud such as the dagesh hazak is clearly vocalized, whereas among Ashkenazic Jews no discernible sound is made. Therefore, it may be a worthwhile thing to differentiate, at least in material intended for certain communities. But again, we should look for typographical (or even calligraphic) precedents that appeared more than just once. We shouldn’t try to reinvent the wheel, as Ezra has done. I’m told that there’s a special place in gehinnom for people who do that kind of thing! (Sorry, I’m not at liberty to divulge my source.)

Bill, the Yiddish linguistics scholar Dovid Katz has proposed that the Asheknazic pronunciation of Hebrew may have been influenced by late Aramaic style more than by Yiddish—and that Yiddish pronunciation, itself, as well as some of its syntax, were heavily influenced by Aramaic. There’s no reason to think that the melding of Sephardic and Mizrahi phonemes one finds in Modern Hebrew have any greater claim on authenticity than do the phonemes of Ashkenaz. Why is Spanish or, say Persian, closer to “proper” Hebrew than Middle High German? Linguistic influence is not measured in miles or kilometers. It was simply the case that, at a certain time in the 20th century, the desire to leave behind anything European was overwhelming. Yet, somehow, Judeo-Spanish was seen as “cleaner” than Judeo-German. Don’t believe the popular press. It puzzles me as to how American Jews got sucked into this agenda, though I do understand how and why it was sold. As for me, I continue to pronounce Hebrew as my father did, and his father before him, even if it means turned heads every time I say “yisgadal v’yiskadash, sh’meih raboh.” And I am not a Hasid.

		<div class="commentbody">Scott-Martin, I did not mean to imply that Israeli pronunciation is somehow more pure or holy. I was just tweaking Israel's obsession of getting all the pronunciation "right" when there is no clear single standard for "right"—and, as I read, there was a ruling that the Torah scroll should not have nikud as nikud are not mi-Sinai. 

I am imagining that Hebrew would sound better with the daled with out dagesh as "th" in "the", tav without dagesh as "th" in "thin" and gimmel without dagesh as "g" in "George," and ayin as "ng". But this is not a well-informed opinion!  </div>

Actually, these Hebrew grammar issues are independent of pronunciation obsessions. An Ashkenazi Jew says toe-may-toe, while a Sephardic Jew says toe-mah-toe. It's still that yummy red vegetable.

There are then 5 dageshes.

A second dagesh is kal,
a third dagesh is chazak,
a fourth dagesh is mavhin,

I prepare work on a shul's private siddur and used the furtive patach. It was well-received. When you educate anyone, the response is generally positive.

		<div class="commentbody">The furtive patach or patach ganuv is defined here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud

A patach on a letters ח, ע, ה at the end of a word is sounded before the letter, and not behind. Thus, נֹחַ (Noah) is pronounced /no-ax/. This only occurs at the ends of words and only with patach and ח, ע, and הּ (that is, ה with a dot (mappiq) in it). This is sometimes called a patach g'nuvah, or "stolen" patach (more formally, "furtive patach"), since the sound "steals" an imaginary epenthetic consonant to make the extra syllable.</div>

then,

Kamatz katan and kamatz gadol,

then,

Shvah-na and shvah-nach.

		<div class="commentbody">GoHebrew, From this last post (And others) It seems that you don't know the basic terms.
but yet, you consistly claim that it can be done in volt.

I allready suggested before "jump into the cold water and solve dificulties as you go along."
OR, First getdown your fundamentals. then you will understand your by your self the broblems you are going to encounter farther on in the project.

I would Check first Dageshim Then sheva's the qamats qatan.
But qamats qatan and shevas work together so you hav to check these both together back and forth.

In volt it's not a matter of just one lookup do all.
you do a check after check where every check norrows down posibilities
So you are checking Sheva and qamats again and again.
because each New lookup can effect somewhere else somthing you hav allready checked before.


Patach as one form only (Patach Genuva is distinguished at the position Like Holam Haser) you don't need an alternate glyph for Patach.

Also Mapik is a normal dagesh kal, and you don't need an alternate glyph.
Mapik is a He + Dagesh Now we all now that Alef,He,Het,Resh Don't get a  dagesh so any dagesh on this letters are Mapik.

If you want to go creazy about all these stuff then according to some you also have SHEVA MERACHEF.

Meteg does not need an alternate glyph because two metegs don't come on one word.

So if i Let say a qamatz (gadol) and Meteg, I won't insert another meteg for mileil or Milera.

I disagree. Why?

The appearance of a meteg and a silug is different (the silug is longer than the meteg), although Unicode encodes them with the same code value. 

They represent different functions, and look different. Hence, they deserve to have their own Unicode code value.</div>

I believe the UTC never responded to an additional meteg proposal, and heard over the past three years there will be a shvah-na proposal. They are not opposed, as these are valid requests.

The short-coming is that certain Hebrew enthusiasts are timid or defeatists, as the Torah compares them to grasshoppers. (weak-willed)</div>

Re: Dagesh Mavhin


Well, we coined the term דגש לתפארת הקריאה from something, no? not the air :) 

Even, the Babylonian Masorah/Tradition has a dagesh mavhin which aim was to draw attention to some words that might be misunderstood ,or sometimes to indicate negative meaning, or just to indicate a different meaning.

This dagesh was very common  with the name Elohim אלהים. That said, when the verse was about just any  Elohim then the letter alef was with dagesh &  the letter lamed with raphe;  any other Elohim -- the alef was with raphe & the lamed with dagesh; but when both the alef and lamed were  with raphe then we're talking about G-D. In other words, there was a distinction between hol and kodesh.

Moreover, this will explain Targum Onkelos:  The Decalogue, Exodus 20:  elohim aherim אלהים אחרים is אלהא אחרן , whereas Leviticus 8: 19  elohim aherim is טעוות עממיא, or דחלן. Again, there is a distinction between hol and kodesh when writing Elohim

But the question is why do we need to encode it? what is the right/correct pronunciation? do we know it?

As always, what you write is an interesting lesson.

Summary, you are saying that the term 'Dagesh Mavhin' is actually a shem hamushal שם המושאל 'a borrowed term' for a function unlike an actual dagesh (kal or chazak).

The hol/kodesh matter is an application of this borrowed term.

A borrowed term is not a shem haetzem שם העצם its actual meaning.

Can't we encode simply to teach or warn, for we do not intent the encoding to be actual?</div>

One just tries, as best one can, to reconstruct how the Hebrew language was pronounced three to five thousand years ago based on the archeological evidence.

This thread helped me update my [[http://www.quadibloc.com/other/hebint.htm|page]] that I've just started to help me quite understand what is being discussed here - I had been using the terms I found in the really old Hebrew grammars in the public domain on Google books, and so from this thread, I was able to Google up some web pages with which to associate the proper Hebrew terms with the half-Hebrew/half-Latin terms I had been using.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One possibility, which would throw tradition to the winds, I fear, would be to leave dagesh kal and mappiq alone, but to indicate dagesh hazak in an entirely new way: by two (perhaps short and heavy) horizontal lines placed where rafe would go.

This would allow dagesh hazak and dagesh kal to be both present at the same time, so that either form of the consonant could be doubled.

In dealing with qamatz katan, however, tradition suggests the way to resolve the ambiguity.

Sometimes, matres lectionis are not available to distinguish between the two kinds of hireq, or between qibbutz and shurek. In those cases, one could put a tiny yod or waw above and to the right of the character. Thus, a tiny aleph in the same position would be the way to indicate qamats katan.

Given that apparently the highly-regarded Koren siddur actually uses a new symbol to indicate qamats katan, apparently modifying the Tiberian system to reduce ambiguity isn't horrifying everyone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,
Question for you guys: do you realize that you're talking about things of which you can't even agree how to spell? Looking at the thread it seems like each person has a completely different ways to spell each niqquudh. Is there a Hebrew dictionary that I can reference that gives the Hebrew name for each of these marks in Hebrew?

From my experience with Hebrew, it seems like the language is in a complete state of disarray...almost schizophrenic. It seems like there are dozens of ways to transliterate the simplest words, the niqquudh sometimes don't seem to make sense (which you have addressed to some extent above), I've seen about half a dozen suggestions for how each vowel point should be pronounced, and I have found multiple ways to spell both the letters and the niqquudh...in HEBREW and in English.

I would appreciate some help or direction...a source, dictionary, or something that is a reliable source.

Thanks.</div>

The spelling of nikud and pronunciation varies among traditions, and time periods. The Jewish people embraced different traditions, which spelled some nikud differently, and pronounced then differently as well.

Transliteration has always been handled diversely, as one person's more perfect convention is considered illogical for another person.

In my view, transliteration is a very superficial factor is understand nikud and its dynamics regarding Hebrew grammar.</div>

David, the problems of Romanization are problems of languages written with latin letters, not problems of Hebrew language, contrary to what you say. Hebrew is normally written in Hebrew script, with no reference to latin letters and hence no disarray or schizophrenia. As John wrote, the transliteration of other non-latin scripts have similar histories and problems. 

The story of efforts to romanize Hebrew is told in the Wikipedia article on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Hebrew|Romanization of Hebrew.]]

You don't need to re-invent the wheel, as there are several complete systems, as explained in the Wikipedia article. If you want consistent transliteration rules you can pick of the systems in the Wikipedia article. If you use your own, nobody will understand you.    

There are complicated reasons relating to tradition and ease of pronunciation for English speakers why many people (including me) don't consistently follow just one of these systems. I can explain these if you like, but in any case you are free to use one of the completely systematic and consistent methods, if that is helpful for your purpose. </div>

The way I understand is that each Hebrew word contains sets of subsequent nikud pairs which render the second one either kal or chazak, depending upon whether the first one is a kamatz or a patach, for example.

Is this correct?

If so, all the nikud must be redefined into two glyph groups, one glyph group for kal nikud, and another glyph group for chazak nikud.

Does this kind of tenuah definition CAUSE a subsequent dagesh in the second letter to become a dagesh kal or chazak?</div>

My Volt project (based upon technology used by SBL-Hebrew) deciphers both Biblical Hebrew text with or without taamimn, or Hebrew vocalized text with or without meteg.

To summarize:

A tenuah chazakah causes the following to be a dagesh chazak, if that letter has a degesh,

But if the previous nikud is a tenuah katanah, then the following letter is dagesh kal, if that letter has a degesh.

1.  How does this relate to a shvah-nah or kamatz katan?
2.  Where is this grammatical rule written?</div>

-------

I never said that a dagesh kal or chazak have anything to do with tenua gedola or ketana.
