    isn't. And if it were wider, it'd be Flyer. But it ain't. \r\n\r\nToo late to
    browse the Big Yellow Book."

  body: Hrmph. I think it is more than likely Scangraphic Futura X-Bold. It has more
    in common and is the correct weight. I rescind my "nice catch" statement. If you
    stare at the G long enough, the bottom is flat and ill-shaped. Mea culpa.

  body: futura x-bold from an old collection i have from ICG.  i searched high and
    low to find the one that matched the old lubalin work and that was the only one
    that had that "G".
