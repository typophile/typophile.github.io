  the attached image is from a German advert for Tiberian Sun from 1999.\r\n\r\nThe
  closest match I can find is Maximus BT, but the a few letters are noticeably different
  once i overlay the type on the image. the letter R is the obvious one. Perhaps they
  used a older revision of  Maximus BT?\r\n\r\nI appreciate any help you can provide.\r\n\r\n-Luke"

  body: "I can't find such a revision of Maximus, but there are many illegal clones
    of it having this /R (but also a different /S) from well-known font forgery companies:\r\n\r\nLevelorDisplayCapsSSi

    usual practice of companies like Southern Software & FontBank was to copy the
    whole font and change only the family name (sometimes they don't even bother to
    replace the copyright of the original foundry) so I assume there was actually
    an older revision of Maximus (or other original font) having this /R and SSi/SSK
    just copied it."
