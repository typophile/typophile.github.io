  body: "Andreas, I can't argue with your basic idea, but these letters looked familiar
    to me. The VA comes from Larabie's [[http://www.dafont.com/sofachrome.font?nb_ppp=50&text=VAC|Sofachrome]].
    The C may have been custom drawn, or it's from another font and just happens to
    work with these shapes.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Rian Hughes, except that I think it is a modified G from that font. (I kept thinking
    I had seen that shape before.)\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    but my font collection has been in a sad state for years now. :-(\r\nMaybe the
    C was just mad up to fit the rest. \r\n\r\nAndreas"
