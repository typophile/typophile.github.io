    the same font ID thread before posting. Once again, Bliss Pro slipped out of my

  body: After all this whole thing was happening in London. So using good english
    type is adequate. Would have been bizarre if this was set in DIN.

  body: "Agreed. Bliss as a typeface and a word interprets well what the Summit is
    about: A bliss for economic growth, financial stability and good jobs for people.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I just saw the picture, I immediately had several typeface names flashing through
    my mind. But I forgot only Bliss. (Bliss is one of my favorite sans serifs)\r\n\r\nJZ"
