  3.2.2 and 3.2.3 are the best support I can come up with for PHD.  <BR> <BR>Am I

  body: I would say if you are using smallcaps that you set it PhD, having the h as
    a smallcap.

  body: 1&#41; make the H 10% smaller, 105% width &#40;to compensate for lost weight&#41;
    <BR> <BR>2&#41; Use Filosofia &#40;it has 2 sizes of &#34;small&#34; cap&#41;
    <BR> <BR>2&#41; Fake the &#34;small small cap&#34;, by using an H from a heavier
    weight, and reducing it in size.

  body: Must you set the name in small caps? Bringhurst&#39;s idea of the name in
    normal text and PHD in small caps is I think much the best solution. If you have
    italic small caps in the font, that would be a possibility for PHD, or Tiffany&#39;s
    suggestion - but these are less good, I think. <BR> <BR>William Berkson, PhD

  body: If the style you&#39;ve chosen is smallcaps, I would use all caps. It looks
    too small, in comparison, set in all smallcaps &#40;phd I mean&#41;. <BR> <BR><img

  body: Hmm. Okay. If you are using all smallcaps, then yes, I would do as you have
    done. I missed the part about you using all smallcaps.

    that I&#39;m short and squat? Hehe. ;^&#41;
