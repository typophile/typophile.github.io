  font? I checked whatthefont with no luck. It looks like there is some customization
  going on here too, but maybe its based on something. Thanks."

  body: "This seems like a few familiar things mixed together, but it could be a single
    font I just can't think of at the moment. It's close to <A href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=204170&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=8236&query=ELROY&SCOPE=Fonts\">Elroy</a>
    and there is also some resemblance to <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=418117&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=35933&query=PIKE&SCOPE=Fonts\">Pike</a>
    (for the 's' maybe).\r\n\r\nPossibly some outline manipulation to make the 'm'
    and 'n' uneven, but something about those letters seems familiar too...\r\n\r\n-
