body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI've recently designed a logo for a band called 'Pink on Black'.
  they are a four piece band with 2 females and 2 males. Their brief was to design
  a logo that was dark and slightly gothic with a femine touch.\r\n\r\nThe logo I've
  come up with has a clean typeface with the serifs adding a slightly gothic 'dark'
  feel without going over the top. \r\n\r\nThe format of it has 'pink' on top of the
  word 'black' to reinforce 'Pink ON black' (obvious).\r\n\r\nI've slanted the 'A'
  in 'black' to create a negative space within the 'N', the 'L' and 'A' which creates
  a triangular shape that resembles the play button of a CD player. When turned at
  90 degrees this shape also represents the female form (according to the Da vinci
  code!). This rotated shape is repeated underneath the type to confirm the idea and
  add another element of interest.\r\n\r\nOverall, it is meant to have a simple, classic
  and timeless look that shouldn't date as the band grow and develop.\r\n\r\nAs usual
  all constructive comments welcomed.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDave"

    or perhaps not as well used as it could be and the triangle device seems, at the
    same time, to be forced and meaningless, while Friz Quadrata doesn't convey a
    gothic feel to me <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=macbeth\">this</a>
    is in a similar vein but far darker. \r\nI apologise if you feel this is harsh,
    but my feeling is you should start again.\r\nTim"

  body: "My first reaction is that you're trying to wrap too many concepts into this
    design. You're using the color pink on the color black, The work \"Pink\" is above
    the word \"Black.\"\r\n\r\nI'm also not getting the play button thing. I understand
    the idea, it's just not prevalent enough in the design to really need to be present.\r\n\r\nI
    understand what you are saying about the rotated shape under the type adding another
    element of interest and \"confirming\" the idea of the female form. But, since
    the pink triangle is such a global symbol of gay pride, you may want to rethink
    its use here.\r\n\r\nAs for the typeface itself, i'm really not sure if it's appropriate.
    I'd have to hear the music or know the genre of music to make an assessment."

  body: "I always look at the logo before reading the justification, so here's what
    I originally thought:\r\n\r\nA group of homosexuals who play Black Flag covers.\r\n\r\nThe
    pink triangle to me said \"Gay Pride\" right away. The band Black Flag uses Friz
    Quadrata (although the bold version) in their logo, which has black rectangles
    in it, much like yours, and the name \"Pink on Black\" could definitely be a pun
    on the whole gay cover band idea. Since you didn't mention anything about this
    in the post, I'd rethink the logo.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    you could just make two of the four bars in the original Blag Flag logo pink and
    you're finished :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bf2_5843.jpg]"

  body: With a band name like "Pink on Black" my first suggestion would be to take
    your expectation (ie, a logo which is pink and black) and do exactly the opposite.
    Reading the words "Pink on Black" while looking at a mark which <em>is</em> pink
    and black creates no resonance. You might try exploring other visual ways of expressing
    the deeper idea of femininity paired with aggression?

  body: "This is all good (if slightly soul destroying) so far! I had no idea about
    the gay pride thing either - quite the wrong message! I think a total re-start
    seems like the best option.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDave\r\n\r\nP.S Please don't
    take this as a sign to stop the feedback. Please continue :)"
