  body: 'I have written to the site owner to see if they can tell me the name of the
    font. I think it is a freeware or maybe comic book font. It is a good example
    of how simple hand-drawn letters  can look good with some graphic treatment. Simply
    by choosing good, bright colors, outlining and adding a drop shadow they have
    made an attractive set of navigation buttons, using a font that could have been
    &#39;home made&#39; for almost no effort or cost. <BR> <BR>I looked through <a
    href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg1.html" target="_blank">Part 6 of
    the Script Font ID Guide</a> and found at least 7 similar styles that could be
    used in a similar way: Oz Poster &#40;Alphabets &#42;Inc&#41;, Balder &#40;Linotype&#41;,
    Eborg &#40;ITC&#41;, Accent &#40;URW&#41;, Fat Tony &#40;Letterhead Fonts&#41;,
    Puff Daddy Bold &#40;Art &amp; Sign&#41;, and Shocard Block &#40;Art &amp; Sign&#41;
    -- sorry I didn&#39;t have time to make links for these. <BR> <BR>I will let you
    know if I get an answer about the font from the futtes.dk site.'

  body: Is it because it contains Danish letters it is so uncommon that no one knows
    it? <BR> <BR>I can settle for a font that just resembles the above...

  body: Hey - There was a good answer already :-&#41; <BR>Sorry. <BR> <BR>Yeah I should
    have written them myselves, but then I would not have gotten all the useful information
    about how it is created and which font are similar :-D <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot!
