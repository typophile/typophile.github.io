  a custom typeface originally designed in 2006 for the Slovak folk dance ensemble
  Poleno, as a part of their corporate identity. Ever since, new weights have been
  added to complete six variables and two different options for accents.\r\nThe typeface
  adds a fresh, bold and non-rational feeling to headlines and titles in books and
  posters in display sizes where emphasis and detail are equally important.\r\nRandomly-generated
  contextual alternates included in the family contribute to add a distinctive look
  to words with repeating characters, whenever they occur next to each other.\r\nhttp://dizajndesign.sk/fonts_Poleno_info.htm"
