  <BR>He says he sent it to FontShop but they never replied. I told him I&#39;d look
  around for someone who might be interested in developing it.  <BR> <BR>He also said,
  &#34;...at the moment Roxane only exists as a research tool not as a real font because
  there are no other weights, italics and not much punctuation; nevertheless I can
  send you a copy if you want...&#34;  <BR> <BR>It looks like a good project for someone
  into designing a useful plain sans family.  <BR> <BR>I told him: &#34;...If I get
  anyone interested in taking the job on then I&#39;ll insist that you are credited
  as the original designer and that you should get half of any sales - although don&#39;t
  expect to retire on the proceeds!...&#34;'

  body: 'What I really like about Roxane is that its design is analytical - something
    very lacking these days. But Gluth is not so analytical that it prevents him from
    taking a leap of faith - and that&#39;s even better. <BR> <BR>On the other hand,
    the good methodology and intentions are largely marred by a misguided foundation.
    His main mistakes are that: <BR>1. He ignores the essentially bouma&#40;word-shape&#41;-based
    nature of immersive reading. <BR>2. He needs to consider conflicts among letters,   not
    just the letters themselves. <BR> <BR>What this adds up to is that Roxane hits
    its target in terms of legibility &#40;where individual letter clarity is paramount&#41;,
    but not &#42;readability&#42; &#40;where word clarity is central&#41;. <BR> <BR>Even
    so, it would be great to have it as a fully finctional font. As for FontFont,
    they only review fonts twice a year during a TypeBoard&#42; meeting; but once
    they do, they let you know of their decision very quickly. He should still get
    a confirmation that they actually got his specimen, but he might have to ask for
    it. <BR> <BR>&#42; <A HREF="http://www.fontfont.de/fffstuff/f_submit.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.fontfont.de/fffstuff/f_submit.html</A>
