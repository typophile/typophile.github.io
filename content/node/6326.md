    I see you lost interest. The second font was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/ribjoint/">Ribjoint.</a>

  body: Alex, maybe Yves likes to play your game, but I would rather help someone
    try to find something they don&#39;t already know than be &#39;tested&#39; with
    two letters &#40;one of which is almost useless&#41; from a variety of fonts that
    could come from anywhere. That style G is about the most common one there is.
    <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve got to be kidding if you think we are going to know &#39;Ribjoint&#39;
    from CAKE Publications, based on the G, or even the whole alphabet. And I&#39;ll
    bet your clue about Bitstream is absolutely the only reason Yves picked their
    version of Gill Sans. There is no difference in those two characters. <BR> <BR>I
    know I don&#39;t have to &#39;play&#39;, but I have to say that such questions
    seem to me like a waste of time.  <BR> <BR>Where is that &#39;Bah Humbug&#39;
    when I need it?
