body: "I am in the process of creating my first visual identity as a designer and
  am feeling a bit overwhelmed by the spectrum of possibilities. The visual identity
  will be used as a starting point for the portfolio, resume, and used for billing
  an occasional freelance project. \r\n\r\nTo get an idea of what employers are looking
  for in a junior's visual identity, I interviewed a few firms (which ironically focus
  on branding) that I am interested in working for upon graduation. The general consensus
  seems to be \"keep it simple\", but make sure it \"stands out\".Hmmmm. I assume
  that taking a typographic approach would probably be best, however I am having difficulty
  selecting the \"right\" typeface. I want the typeface to read \"creative\" \"fresh\"
  and as requested \"simple\". The face that I am gravitating towards is Insigna because
  the \"J\" \"M\" \"A\" seem to add some interest to my long and awkward looking name.
  The big problem with this is it looks a bit too much like a \"frat house\" identity.\r\n\r\n-\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/workmark_6497.jpg]\r\n-\r\n\r\nAnyway...
  In light of being overwhelmed I thought I would throw a few questions to those with
  a bit more experience. \r\n\r\n\r\n1. What is the most important thing you want
  your clients to read from your identity? And what typeface did you select fulfill
  that goal? \r\n\r\n2. How did you go about selecting the right typeface. What was
  your process?\r\n\r\n3. If anyone has any suggestions for typefaces that read \"creative,
  fresh and simple\", I am all ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "When you choose the typeface for your portfolio choose something like Univers
    that will go completely unnoticed. The identity of your portfolio should allow
    people to focus on your  work, not the identity. If you want your portfolio to
    stand out, the entire piece needs to have a really great concept driving it, and
    a typeface isn\u2019t going to do that.\r\n\r\nUsing a novelty face is a bad idea,
    and using a Neville Brody face from 1986 is akin to putting in a title page that
    says \u201CI went to to a school that did not teach design history, I haven\u2019t
    studied it on my own, and I\u2019m out of touch with contemporary graphic design\u201D."

  body: "Thanks for your feedback. \r\n\r\nThe point of the project is more to create
    a \"word mark\" that can be used in other applications (business cards etc.) that
    carries over into the portfolio. (maybe that is a bad idea, I'm not sure) \r\n\r\n\r\nYour
    response further clarifies my issue though. How does one balance simplicity and
    clarity with visual interest when choosing a typeface for a word mark? "

  body: "Go to the biggest mall in town. Take your camera and a sketchbook. Look at
    everything in sight, identify the marks that work and differentiate them from
    the ones that don\u2019t. Take lots of notes and pictures. Go home and do some
    sketches. Then go to bed, wake up the next day, and think about it all. \r\n\r\nDoing
    some reading will probably help, too. Take a look at Willi Kunz\u2019s books,
    he has some ideas that will be dead on for this project. "

  body: "If you are creating a personal identity, I would create something <em>you
    like</em>, instead of what 'they' like. I would try to show what you are about,
    and the only way to do that is to make something that comes from yourself.\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, I would not worry too much about what other people tell you it should
    look like. Just take a sketchbook, Illustrator or whatever suits you for making
    sketches, and start brainstorming. :)\r\n\r\nYou'll end up with alot of different
    approaches. Pick one or two of them, and go from there."

  body: "Following up on Jelmar\u2019s advice: think about the kind of firm that you
    want to work for. When I was in design school my portfolio was in constant flux
    as I shifted it around to try and impress different firms based on advice from
    my professors, and most of the time my portfolio really looked like crap, both
    online and in print. It really only got better when I realized that the reason
    I could never come up with a great idea for a really wild portfolio with special
    leave-behind items was because I don\u2019t really want to work for the firms
    that appreciate that stuff. I ditched all my expensive portfolio books and boxes
    and the custom web site for a $5 Muji portfolio and an Indexhibit web site that
    I actually like and the whole thing works about a million times better."

  body: "Jay Mac, it's a big thing to dive into, branding yourself. Lots of good suggestions
    in here already that I'd like to echo: Create something you like. Use a typeface
    that's timeless (univers, helvetica, etc).\r\n\r\nBeing overwhelmed isn't a bad
    thing. At this point, I'd suggest hunkering down with a notebook and sketching
    the word mark. When you feel exhausted like you can't sketch anymore, quit for
    the night. Rest. Review the results.\r\n\r\nRegarding your questions:\r\n\r\n1.
    Most important thing is that you're consistent. People value consistency in an
    identity over anything else (there's been plenty of research to back this). I
    choose Helvetica Neue for my identity because of it's reliable consistency.\r\n\r\nWhy
    Helvetica? I was looking for something neutral and honest. It works for me, I
    like it, and I feel it left me plenty of room to be creative. Have a look: http://www.jasonrobb.com
    I've also kept consistent in my portfolio: http://jasonrobb.com/i/jasonrobb-resume-portfolio.pdf
    I use the same header info on invoices as well.\r\n\r\n2. My process for choosing
    Helvetica was simple. I didn't know much about typefaces at the time, so I picked
    something that was familiar and that I wouldn't get sick of too quickly. It's
    held up for a few years now, and I haven't grown out of it yet.\r\n\r\n3. Creative,
    fresh and simple typefaces: I'm a big fan of Jos Buivenga's work - http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/
    Museo and Museo Sans. Joshua Darden's Freight Sans http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_sans
    , TypeTrust's Aaux Next http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=Njc5  ... are
    three of my favorites that come to mind at the moment."

  body: "James & James - Now I am laughing out loud.\r\n\r\nI think that if you are
    new to the biz and you don't know how you want to be seen, or how to make people
    see you that way via your ID it is inevitable that you can't turn lamb into mutton,
    if you see what I mean.  Attempts to do so will be seen through in 90% of cases.\r\n\r\nJames
    M is also right to suggest that you can't control how people see you. And in fact
    people will see you many different ways and all too often ignore you. And this
    is inevitable & in the end okay. \r\n\r\nI think the advice given is essentially
    sound. If you feel like a deer caught in headlights - go to the safety of the
    modern. It's boring but okay. \r\n\r\nWhen you feel you have a good grasp on how
    to do more, let go and \"swim away from the edge of the pool\". "
