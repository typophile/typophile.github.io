  with all aspects of typography, that I have named Display/Type.\r\n\r\nI can't seem
  to get the logo quite right - there are some issues with letterspacing, particularly
  TYP and LA. Any solutions to the letterspacing, or comments on the logo in general
  are much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe logo is set in Akzidenz Grotesk, but I'm sure most
  of you would identify it easily enough =)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nGary"

  body: "Also tried it in Akkurat (added it to the original post)...\r\n\r\nI think
    'PLAY' looks more balanced now, although I'm not sure if I have made the L too
    narrow or not.\r\n\r\nStill having issues with TYP - I don't want them touching
    at the top as it doesn't look right."

    to the A\r\n\r\nthe AY seems a bit too far apart as well. maybe make the stem
    of the T longer to combat the Y ? i think the only way you're gonna make it work
    is to connect them somehow, or the Y is always going to come to prominence"

  body: Unfortunately "LAY" and "TY" are tough letter combinations to get right. I
    think your best option may be to letterspace them out a bit, especially if you
    don't want the letters to touch. Or, you could try using a more condensed typeface,
    Trade Gothic Bold Condensed, or Univers Condensed.

  body: "Try making the angled lines the same angles an in the specific typeface,
    as it is, more or less on the second logo (picture8). I think a bolder typeface
    works better for this. Try aligning letters more, you can modify the letters to
    fit what you want. I agree with both gerald and chris, space out the letters a
    little.\r\n\r\nJonE."

  body: "Thanks for the tips folks. After a bit of tinkering, I think I'm getting
    there...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pic2_5056.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    much prefer it reversed out, looks more interesting. \r\n\r\nGerald - L has been
    extended - you confirmed my concerns about it. Was trying to reduce the negative
    space between L and A, but I think it's alright now. I've also extended the stem
    of the T a little.\r\n\r\nChris - I've spaced them out a bit more, do you think
    it looks more balanced now? I had tried some condensed faces, but didn't like
    the results. I'm a huge fan of condensed faces, but on this occasion they didn't
    suit the sloping lines, and it looked rather squashed. \r\n\r\nJeo - You're right
    about the bolder typeface working better. I didn't have a bold enough version
    of Akkurat, so I've fattened it up a bit. The angled lines are taken from the
    angle of the Y."

  body: "Way better. The kerning with 'TYPE' is as good as it can get by itself. The
    only thing now would be to align the edges of the letters to each other...for
    instance, aligning the bottom left edge of the L with the right, inside part of
    the Y, this will 'lock' everything in place.\r\nAlso the line to the most right
    is kind of far away from the 'Y' creating a more visible part of the word. Since
    there are two lines in the beginning, that 'cuts' up the word more in the front
    then in the back. Don't be afraid to take away more of the E. I like the spacing
    of the last line as it is in picture 3.\r\n\r\nJonE."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pic3_6011.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks very
    much for that suggestion - I've shifted TYPE so the Y and L lined up, and almost
    magically T lined up with P, and Y with E! Looks a lot better now, cheers.\r\n\r\nI
    see your point regarding the cropping, although I feel 'E' looks strange when
    cropped too much, and when the diagonal line is too close to the Y, it creates
    an awkward trapped space between them. Plus, with there being so much empty space
    at the bottom left, a little space between Y and the line provides a bit of balance
    (I think!)."
