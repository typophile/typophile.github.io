body: I know I probably sound really stupid right now, but I can't identify between
  Tw Cen MT and Futura. If they were side by side, I could tell the difference (seems
  like Tw Cen is slightly heavier) however if I were just to look at a sign set in
  one or the other I wouldn't be able to tell what it was. What are some key differences?

  body: The greatest differences are highlighted when you look at the lower case,
    particularly the shapes of counters for letters like a, b, d, g, p and q.

  body: Could you point out specifically what to look for? I know there's more *totally
    blanking out on the term right now* "thinning" where the bowls meet the stems
    but not a large enough difference that I would be able to ID the typeface just
    by looking at one without comparison to the other. I need something I can tell
    easily just by looking at one without comparing the two. For example one thing
    I found was that the arm of the 'r' is cut off vertically in Tw Cen while in Futura
    it cuts off at an angle

  body: There are people here who can perform that kind of on-the-spot identification
    and hopefully give you some pointers, if I am at the point of needing to tell
    them apart it is usually in a computer environment where I have a number of tools
    at my disposal (e.g., FontLab, FontForge, InDesign, Word, etc...) to make the
    distinction.

    counters such as in the lowercase b and d are more nearly perfectly circular</li>\r\n<li>the
    ascenders and descenders are shorter</li>\r\n<li>the dots on the lowercase i and
    j are bolder and closer to the stems</li>\r\n<li>the crossbar on the lowercase
    f extends farther to the left</li>\r\n<li>the counter in the lowercase e is vertically
    narrower (the entire outer shape of the e is more nearly perfectly circular)</li>\r\n<li>the
    4 is wider and the angle on the diagonal closer to 45\xB0</li>\r\n<li>the asterisk
    is flower-shaped, with rounded terminals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

  body: Also what are your thoughts of people using Tw Cen instead of Futura? Some
    people seem to be really against it because they see it as a Arial-Helvetica relationship
    but personally I don't have a problem with it. Then again, I don't know much about
    the differences between the two

    The choice then becomes which cut.\r\n\r\nThat aside, to my eye, Futura, at least
    in the lighter weights, seems more elegant, probably due to the fact that it is
    slightly lighter and has longer ascenders and descenders. Use Twentieth Century
    for a truckers\u2019 convention, Futura for a fashion show."

  body: "Futura seems much better to me, and I have to disagree, Hrant, it can be
    really beautiful, if used correctly. I saw a book by Paul Renner completely set
    in a heavier cut of futura, and it is gorgeous. I also love the Isotype displays.
    But then again I also like Bodoni, if used right... :P\r\n\r\nI have Lanstons
    Twentieth Century Pro, which has only one weight, but it does also have all the
    extra characters Renner designed for Futura, but were never issued (until the
    digital age, that is), so in a sense this is even more authentic than Futura...."

  body: "Futura is one of the most important fonts of all time if you ask me, never
    seen the other.  That said, Futura can be a little stale in some ways.  I find
    myself using the caps in the extra bold often for display work however, while
    almost never using any other weight in the family for anything. \r\n\r\nSo many
    other fonts flowed from Futura like saplings from a father tree, it influenced
    quite a lot.  Every Geometric font ever made owes something to Futura. For that
    at least, Futura is Great."

  body: And then there's Mid-Century... one of the typestyles made available for the
    IBM Executive typewriter. Of course, with a crude five-unit system, it can't be
    compared to a real printers' typeface, but it did show up in a number of computer
    manuals, from DEC and SDS.
