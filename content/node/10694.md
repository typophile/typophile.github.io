  body: ' Miguel: <BR> <BR>For what you were attempting, it works very well. Still,
    I have to agree that it isn&#39;t very readable. <BR> <BR>The biggest part of
    the problem isn&#39;t in the design. I think the design is very good, again, for
    what you were attempting to create, which seems to be a display face that can
    be used at bitmapped text sizes. <BR> <BR>The problem instead lies in the fact
    that inline Bauhaus fonts like this were never meant to be used at sizes this
    small. It&#39;s the inline form relative to its size that&#39;s the problem --
    not your interpretation of it. To that end, I&#39;m not sure that thickening the
    black lines will be of significant help. I suspect that you&#39;d just end up
    with an even heavier font that looks cool but is difficult to read at small sizes.
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR>
    <BR>I think perhaps the best solution would be to enlarge the font overall to
    a size where it has acceptible readability, and treat it as a &#40;very cool&#41;
    display face rather than a text face. <BR> <BR>David '
