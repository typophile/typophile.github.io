    body: "Hey Ryuk,\r\n\r\nThanks for that. Yeah, there's some weirdness going on
      with this forum.. When I made that first post, I looked under \"My Posts\" and
      it wasn't there... so I thought I hadn't posted it properly, so I posted it
      again. Turns out nothing new is appearing in My Posts.\r\n\r\nSorry for the
      double-up, and thanks for your answer. I think you're right - probably a customised
      Tuscan font. I was intrigued by the A and the E, so I thought it might be a
      certain other style.. they almost look Cyrillic to me.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick"
