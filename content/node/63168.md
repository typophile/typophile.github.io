  A project long in the works, we have merged the typography portal Typo.cz and the
  TYPO magazine website -- <strong>[[http://www.typo.cz/en|www.typo.cz]]</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe
  website is now built on the WordPress publishing system. This system allows the
  editors to publish articles and news quickly and easily, and offers space for reader
  discussions. As a result, Typo.cz has become a full-fledged blog that will be updated
  regularly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web-en_6151.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing
  a lengthy debate, we decided to provide the most space on the homepage to the blog,
  which will be focused on news and commentary on graphic design and typography. What\u2019s
  new, brief news from the sector that readers can submit by using a simple form,
  and a calendar, which functions on the same principle, have been added to the right
  column. Another new feature is a convenient form for readers to submit their tips
  for website of the week, font of the week and photographs for the photo of the week
  section.\r\n\r\nAll new articles, news and entries in the calendar are automatically
  sent to Twitter \u2013 tune us in at <strong>[[http://www.twitter.com/typo_en|typo_en]]</strong>.
  And it would be unimaginable for the site to be without RSS feeds and search tools.\r\n\r\nAn
  online order form for subscriptions to TYPO magazine has also been set up, making
  it possible for you to pay for subscriptions by credit/debit card or bank transfer.
  Individual back issued can also be ordered. The contents of all the issues published
  so far, a list of contributors and additional information about the magazine are
  also featured on the site.\r\n\r\n<strong>Special discount</strong>\r\n\r\nGet a
  <strong>5%</strong> discount for one-year subscription or <strong>10%</strong> discount
  for a subscription for two years. Just enter <em>TYPOPHILE</em> as a promotional
  code on the subscription form."
