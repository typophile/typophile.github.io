  from the culture blog of The Economist. It's about the centenary of the birth of
  [[Roger Excoffon]], the great designer of the types Mistral, Banco, and Antique
  Olive, among others, and the man who gave Air France its trademark look in its heyday.
  To my French colleagues who were, apparently, oblivious to the event, I say \"honte
  \xE0 toi! Honte inexpiable!\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2010/09/mistral_font\r\n\r\nScott-Martin

  body: "I had no idea Mistral was so widespread in France!\r\n\r\nI must admit (with
    some guilt) that I tended to dislike most of Excoffon's typefaces until I saw
    [[http://channel.walkerart.org/play/process-type-foundry-minneapolis/|this lecture]]
    given by Process Type Foundry, where Eric Olson talks (near the 23 minute mark)
    about the beginnings of Excoffon's Antique Olive. Becoming aware of how well Excoffon's
    typefaces had been used in the past made me appreciate them. I still cringe when
    I see mercilessly distorted Antique Olive and Banco though."

    it for the body copy of some ads in the 1980s, very solid!"

  body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nSeems to be the right time and location to announce
    this: I am currently halfway through the layout of an upcoming book about Roger
    Excoffon. The book will focus on Excoffon's life and achievements, and will also
    contain memories, recollections and essays from his friends and admirers, such
    as Peter Knapp, Jose Mendoza y Almeida, Hrant Papazian, Jean-Francois Porchez,
    Massin, Yves Perrousseaux, Francois Richaudeau, et al. It will be filled with
    high quality illustrations, rare documents and photographs, and the text will
    be in french and english.\r\n\r\nThe book, \"Roger Excoffon, gentleman & typographe\",
    is due to be released around spring 2011 at Atelier Perrousseaux (www.perrousseaux.com)."

    find it worthwhile to attend the following event at 7 pm:\r\n\r\nThis year marks
    the centenary of the birth of Roger Excoffon, arguably the most famous and innovative
    French type designer of the 20th century. For the 2010 Beatrice Warde Memorial
    Lecture, S\xE9bastien Morlighem will share his research on Excoffon from the past
    three years, as an introduction to the forthcoming book <em>Roger Excoffon et
    la Fonderie Olive </em>(Biblioth\xE8que typographique). The lecture will be an
    opportunity to unveil many previously unknown documents and to discuss several
    aspects of his work for the Fonderie Olive.\r\n"
