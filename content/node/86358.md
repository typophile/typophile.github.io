  I am allowed to use and how font licensing works in this situation. I had assumed
  that I could use Museo Slab (which is the font used for the product's branding)
  and embed it in the application (much like a font is embedded in a flash movie on
  a website) and the font would only be available for the application I'm distributing.
  It never occurred to me that there might be a licensing issue. But it sounds like
  maybe this isn't the case? When I contacted the foundry to ask, they say the font
  I want to use \"is not available for your licensing purposes\". \r\n\r\nCan someone
  explain how custom fonts for iphone apps work? And in what circumstances I can use
  a font (ie can I still use it as an image embedded in the app)? And does anyone
  know of a good alternative to Museo Slab that I could use for an iphone app?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    supposed to be installed on 1 to 5 computers and not on possibly millions of devices
    of the users who use your app. \r\n\r\nFSI has just started to license fonts for
    iOS apps: http://www.mobilefontfonts.com/\r\nThe pricing is pretty fair, too!"

  body: 'Seems like such a weird restriction since I''m using the free version of
    Museo Slab. I wonder if these licenses are outdated will change any time soon?
    My understanding is the font is embedded within the iPhone app, and not installed
    like it would be with desktop software distribution. But oh well... Thanks for
    the mobilefontfont link! '

  body: "It's not about what you call \u201Cembedding\u201D. It's about whether or
    not the font software is used. If you embed glyphs in a PDF or just create a logo
    as a bitmap, the ones using these files don't use the original font software.
    \r\nBut if you embed the font software in an app, you redistribute the software
    to an unlimited number of people and it is used as it would be installed on the
    device. That's something very different. "

  body: "I just came through this discussion and I wanted to add my two cents as I
    thought the point of the <a href=\"http://www.mobilefontfonts.com/\">Mobile FontFonts</a>
    website was more legibility than licensing issues.\r\n\r\nLet say I want to buy
    <a href=\"http://www.mobilefontfonts.com/font/8376/usecases\">FF Yoga Mobile</a>
    (from Xavier Dupr\xE9) on <a href=\"http://www.mobilefontfonts.com/\">Mobile FontFonts</a>.
    When take a look at my cart I've got:\r\n\r\nFF Yoga Sans Mobile Pro \u20AC 159.00\r\nLicenses:
    \ 5\r\n\r\nAt this step I see no difference on the licencing point as I always
    have to choose the number of devices (1000 max. which isn't realistic in the case
    of an app)\r\nI thought the only difference concerned legibility issues more than
    the licencing issue because as you could see on the screenshot bellow, the price
    of the mobile font is the same than the classical version:\r\n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6143195/Screenshots/FF-Yoga-Mobile.png\"
    />\r\n\r\nSo, from my side, the licencing issue raised by @jujube is not really
    solved.\r\nI thought the price of Mobile FontFonts fonts would be higher than
    the classical versions and that I wouldn't have to choose the number of devices
    (as we don't have this data during the design process and the app would be used
    by a potentialy high number of users).\r\n\r\nWith the informations I have, I
    guess the better solution is to ask the foundry or the type designer himself to
    know wether the font could be used within iPhone app or not ?\r\n\r\nSo, what
    you think ?\r\nMaybe I missed something ?\r\n\r\n"
