    Fonts</a>. If one of the typophiles does not suggest a name, you might consider
    visiting the Letterhead Fonts website and going through the catalog.\r\nDon"

  body: "You're welcome.\r\nAs for Letterhead, they had a many fonts released under
    their name that they no longer sell at their website. These fonts are now in limbo,
    endlessly downloaded but without any possible return to the designer. AFAIK, they
    were never released as \"free\" fonts. That being said, the design may be in one
    of these. Google will find them if you look.\r\nThe lettering in the image is
    representative of fonts from the latter half of the 19th century, mini serifs
    & spurs being the main features of the basis for this lettering. To find it, or
    something close, a good strategy is to go though the revival & \"inspired by\"
    offerings, at MyFonts, Fontspring or elsewhere,  of Intellecta Design, Font Mesa,
    Greater Albion Typefounders, Jeff Levine, and HiH. It could also be a revival
    from the Solo collection, by Solotype or somebody else.\r\nIf you are in luck
    one of the typophiles is doing this already.\r\nDon\r\n"
