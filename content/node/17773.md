body: "I am working on a packaging project designing sleeves that slip over boxes
  of chocolate (sort of like a slipcase). I am looking for Art Deco-ish typefaces
  to go with the existing packaging, which although it strictly isn't Art Deco, has
  a very 1920s feel to it. I work for a retailer that carries the brand and we are
  splitting the cost of the sleeves 50/50.\r\n\r\nI've done a few searches, and I
  came across Goldenbook by Mark Simonson which I'll probably end up getting, but
  nothing else has really caught my eye. I want something that is elegant and feels
  luxurious, but isn't too avant garde."

  body: In their latest printed promo, House Industries showed Paperback used on packaging
    and it looked very lovely. Used correctly it could feel the right way. I think.

  body: "Thanks for that link to Louise Fili, Stephen. I actually checked out \"French
    Modern\" from the library and scanned some pages for reference.\r\n\r\nI bought
    Estilo through MyFonts earlier today and am playing with that. \r\n\r\nI actually
    purchase Coquette about a year ago on another chocolate related project. However,
    I don't think it will work for this project.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to avoid the high
    contrast Deco faces, which is why I was looking for a serif. I want my design
    to whisper Deco as opposed to shouting it."
