body: "Hi everybody, I'm looking for a solution on a branding project for a startup
  company that is about to introduce a newly invented medical device. In search for
  an appropriate sans serif I came across Spiekermann's \"DB Sans\" which would be
  perfect in my opinion but is unfortunately unavailable for purchasing, I've looked
  at FF Unit, Vista Sans, and vesta. \r\n\r\nAdditional suggestions anybody? \r\nthanks.....
  in advance..."

  body: "Stephen, I'm looking for both, headline & text alike. \r\n\r\nThank you all
    for the suggestions, I'm still reviewing all of them carefully, somehow I'm still
    hooked on DB Sans (perhaps because I can't have it...) \r\n\r\nI've been looking
    at the <a href=\"http://www.spiekermannpartners.com/e_c_bahn.html\">examples here</a>
    that sans is just amazing!\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards FF Info so far, this design
    needs to come across as professional & warm alike, so please post your suggestions
    or comments if I'm on the right track here, thanks again."
