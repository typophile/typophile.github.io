  section.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/agd-small_3549.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo,
  this is a <em>very</em> rough vector scetch of three letters of a face I have dreamed
  up.\r\nIt's supposed to be an ultra-extended, demibold (bold? black? <-tell me how
  you feel it is), slightly squareish (rectanglish, actually) DISPLAY typeface on
  the lines of what I have sketched, though the idea would be to make it much less
  edgy/rough. (I just could not care about the right bezier tangents when drawing
  this up at work while I should have been doing something else).\r\n\r\nAn other
  idea is that due to it's ultra-extendedness (which is equivalent to vertical compression)
  the layered letters (i.e. those which have a vertical structuring within the x-height:
  a,g,x,e, &c.) will have to leave the x-height (as you can see in the case of the
  'a' or be cropped, but in a way, which would not decrease legibility (as you can
  see it in the case of 'g').\r\n\r\nFor the letters e and f (and some others) I'd
  plan alternates: for the e one that sits on the basline and has the loop in the
  ascender height, and one which has the loop on the x-height and the lower arc in
  the descender; similarly for the f.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy question is: do you like the idea?
  Is this font worth pursuing? Is there _any_ use or any market for such a display
  typeface?\r\n\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: "I think I speak for everyone when I say that it's quite difficult to respond
    to your many in-depth questions given how little developed the typeface is right
    now. The image you've shown is very crude and it's very hard to imagine what this
    typeface would look like in the end. There are needs for almost any type of face,
    but I would go ahead and rough this out much further before presenting it for
    such specific critique.\r\n\r\nBest of luck. "
