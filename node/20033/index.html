<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Thomas mentioned at last month's TypeTech session in New York that Adobe was about a month away from releasing the newest [[Adobe FDK|FDK]] complete with hinting plug-in for FontLab. I was just wondering if a real release date was available now?
What say ye Thomas?

<div class=commentbody>The new FDK will include the Adobe PS auto-hinter, which can be run on fonts as a stand-alone utility as part of the FDK, and which FontLab will also be able to incorporate into its own programs. I'm pretty sure FontLab will do this, since it will be an improvement over the current FL autohinting, but will give users the option to manually edit the results, which the autohinter does not by itself.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually, we could release the FDK any day now, I just need to settle one question about bumping the OS/2 table version string. What this space.
As Miguel has clarified, the auto-hinter is already a FontLab plug-in macro, and a separate command-line tool. It can be run on both Type 1 and OpenType CFF fonts (or in FontLab on any font with PS style outlines, which can then be exported to Type 1 or OT CFF). However, we could hope for tighter integration into FontLab in a future version of the app.

Since I don't want this thread to turn to FDK vs. VOLT (there was a thread that started with negative attitude toward MS) - and in order to keep it clean, let us talk about FDK (& FontLab.)

If FDK can support the OpenType features that FL can't handle - that will be great.
I don't know what stage FDK is in, but if it were up to me - to add these features and wait even 6 months - then add & wait.

But since I'm not behind the Adobe curtains I don't know what Adobe is up to. However, since FDK isn't like any other product by Adobe (e.g. InDesign, Photoshop - that you keep everything secret till the release ) maybe you or Thomas can shed some OpenType light.
Thank you.

FontLab Studio 5 uses exactly the same Adobe code that is in AFDKO 1.6. When AFDKO 2.0 is released, it will take some time until that code is incorporated into FontLab Studio, so in the meantime, AFDKO will have some advantage. However, from what I remember seeing at Read Roberts˚ presentation in The Hague, I don˚t think that AFDKO 2.0 will support any new lookup types.

<div class=commentbody>That's right: AFDKO 2.0 does not yet add new lookup types. That's in the next big release, some time early next year.
I expect that we will settle the OS/2 version question in the next couple of work days. After that, there may be a delay of up to a week or two before the new FDK bits are actually posted (depends on our web team).
Right now, for most people, I think the FDK is mostly some additional tools, and I don't expect most users will actually build their OT fonts using the FDK. They'll use it for proofing/testing tools, and they'll maybe use some of the scripts and plug-ins.

Hello Thomas,
but a few people like me compile their fonts with it. So it would be great if the time between each release don't went to long. One of the great features I like is to build and store the font sources splitted into their single parts and to do batch generation.
Which Phyton version will be needed to run the new FDK properly?

<div class=commentbody>Pro: This is the auto-hinter Adobe has used for close to two decades now, which we believe is the best auto-hinter available for PostScript style outlines.
Essentially, this is the crown jewels of Adobe font production.
When you have this available to you in a font editor like FontLab, you'll have the option of further tweaking the hints to your heart's content. It's not like you're stuck with the results.
Cons: None that I can think of.

<div class=commentbody>What's to learn? The whole point of an auto-hinter is that you don't have to learn much of anything.
Adobe's auto-hinter, like FontLab's, does require that you set zones and stems separately. So you use the auto-blue-zones and auto-stems buttons in FontLab, and then use the auto-hinter. Done!

<div class=commentbody>Sorry, didn't mean to be flippant. Here's the easy option explained:
First make your font. :)
Then go into the Font Info, under "Hinting Settings." On the main panel, click the green diamond to get the automatically calculated alignment zones. Then on the "Standard Stems" panel, click the green diamond to automatically calculate standard stems. Then come back out to the font and select all, and auto-hint the font (either using FontLab's existing auto-hinting, with the F7 key, or using the new plug-in when it's available).
Not too tough, eh wot?
Now, it is still worth learning about hinting, but you don't have to know much about it to make use of it. However, for hinting to work well, you do have to understand enough about type design to have actually used overshoot, etc.

T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thomas,
Note that FontLab Studio will automatically compute the stems only when you already have hints in the font. So actually, the process is the other way around:
1. Select all glyphs in the Font Window.
2. Hit F7 to autohint all the glyphs (or choose Tools / Hints and Guides / Autohinting).
3. Go to Font Info / Hinting settings, click on Auto zones and then in Standard stems on Auto stems.
That's it.
Best,
Adam

<div class=commentbody>thomas, thanks alot for your answer (and adam, you too for adding information).
i think for the time i've been doing it i know quite a bit about type design, but what do you mean with overshoot? if it means the simple fact that you have to make round shapes (and "peaks" like the A in some faces) go below and above the xheight / baseline to look as big as other characters (H and O as easy examples) i know what you mean if not, please explain, learning new things is always good.

will the new version accept the manual setting of usWinAscent
and usWinDescent?
This is an important issue and a lack of the current version and hopefully easy to build in.

<div class=commentbody>AFAIK, the OSX tools are all command line, so no GUI.
But some of the tools have their Fontlab macro equivalent, so those will "have" GUI.
The command line tools are quite more powerful and reliable, tho.
From the "AFDKO Overview" file:
<em>Scripts for FontLab. None of these are polished production tools. They are mostly Python scripts written once and used once for a particular need, with little error checking, and are supplied mostly as an example of how to do something in FontLab.</em>
Nonetheless, we've been pushing the Autohint.py (FL macro) to do everything the autohint (command line) does, since we see a big benefit there. You see, the autohint can't be directly applied to .vfb files ;^)</div>

<div class=commentbody>For the first point, do you mean that you want to have multiple possible input names, all of which would yield the same possible output glyph name? What would the FDK do in the case of a collision?
As for the second point, we definitely aren't supporting more than one Unicode for a single glyph. Although such double-mapping is permitted by the OpenType spec, we don't like it because it breaks the reliability of glyph-to-character mapping, as is sometimes necessary in PDF based workflows.

<div class=commentbody>Hello Thomas,
example for the big letter germandbls:
at the moment I use
Germandbls Germandbls uniEA8A
Adam means, Germandbls is logical from the human perspektiv but not for the current implementation since its not official. So he suggest to use germandbls.cap.
So I like to add both names. Maybe in a form like this:
Germandbls Germandbls uniEA8A germandlbs.cap
ps. In this case I remember to update the Adobe Type engine, not to exchange "hard coded" germandbls bei SS since this is no hard rule for every case and can pruduce invalid names and documents. The feature code should have priority and should not be ignored like the current implementation in InDesign CS and CS2.
The thing with double assignments:
If I remember right, the current FontLab will apply such double codepoints to some glyphs.
And why not? If a glyph have exactly the same outline, spacing and positioning but shares two or more different codepoints, its good to assign all these codepoints to a single glyph. Some kind of "compression".
The problem I see is, if one codepoint is included in feature or kerning code only and an other one uses a different code. In these cases the FDK should report an error and suggest a codepoint splitting.
- The same for shared names.

<div class=commentbody>Andreas,
The germandbls example you gave is very specific, and has other implications. (We actually have discussed this issue internally). Could you give another example?
> <em>The thing with double assignments: [...] And why not?</em>
As Thomas said, the OTF spec permits double-mapping (a given glyph is mapped to more than one Unicode value), but that makes it hard for Acrobat to reverse map from Unicode encodings to character codes, for searching.
> <em>If a glyph have exactly the same outline, spacing and positioning but shares two or more different codepoints, its good to assign all these codepoints to a single glyph. Some kind of “compression”.</em>
An OpenType [[CFF]] (Compact Font Format) font will have the "compression" you're looking for. It's called [[Subroutinization]]: process by which common elements in a set of glyphs are decomposed in separate subroutines.
> <em>The problem I see is, if one codepoint is included in feature or kerning code only and an other one uses a different code. In these cases the FDK should report an error and suggest a codepoint splitting.</em>
I don't get it. Does this mean that, for example, you wouldn't put the two Delta (U+0394 and U+2206) in the same kerning class? I might be missing something, but the only reason that would stop me for putting them in the same class, would be if the glyphs' designs were different.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello Migel,
yes, the german thing is specific. In general I think most of these double assignment scenarios are very specific. In most cases no real alphabetic or "word building" glyphs are involved, but accents, punctuation, numbers or signs could be. Typically these things will not be searched.
but you ask for samples: (please feel free to post better ones)
hypen 002D, hypentwo 2010
blackstar 2605, star operator 22C6
slash 002F, big solidus 29F8 (depents on the slash design)
If I understand some comments about the CFF compression right, it has its limits if the outline data is reaching a high volume or complexity.
I see the point with the Acrobat compatibility issue, but if someone wants a "proper" PDF for a special long term archive, he should use special or standard clean Adobe fonts too. I don't see the point to restrict it for every possible font development.
If the pdf creator stores the double, tripple assigments too, it should be possible to search these glyphs in a proper way. One step forward is to store language specific warpers/tags around the text elements.
example scenario:
Someone use a tripple mapping for a real alphabetic glyph like B for latin, greek and cyrillic. So, if the search string is given in an unicode enviroment, its always possible to match the right glyph or string, since all unicode assigments are stored. Language specific warpers will help to filter possible "false" strings from other languages.

If you're trying to build, say, a Japanese font with 20,000 glyphs and subroutinize it, you'd better have a lot of RAM. But other than that, I can't think of any limits that we've seen in actual fonts.
Then again, I just woke up from a nap and am still a bit groggy, so maybe I'm forgetting something. Can you give a more specific reference?

Andreas,
you’re talking about introducing more flexibility in the domain where we, font developers, have influence (the way glyphs are named or encoded in the font) but on the other hand you want other domains (applications) to worry about making sure that everything still works fine for the user. In other words, you want to buy yourself some freedom at the expense of application developers.
But this will not work. Font developers are a smaller community and therefore can work out certain standards of behavior better. Application developers are a very large group and their efforts are rather uncoordinated. For example, you say "if the pdf creator". But there are 200 different PDF creators on the market, some relying on partial implementations of the standard (e.g. the Quartz engine in Mac OS X), some relying on implementation of older PDF versions, some relying on the PostScript-to-PDF conversion etc. At least in half of the scenarios, OpenType PS fonts are converted to Type 1 fonts (so cmap, GSUB etc. are all removed and only glyph names travel into the file) and the additional Unicode stream is not stored. Therefore, the PDF really only has a visual glyph representation of the text, there is no metadata. Such PDFs will ALWAYS be better searchable if the each glyph has a unique glyphname and just one Unicode codepoint. You should not think of PDF being only dependant on what Acrobat is doing. The problem is less and less with Acrobat because Acrobat is getting smarter and smarter. But there are many other tools for searching inside of PDFs, for example plugins for Spotlight, Google Desktop Search or Microsoft search etc., and there is no guarantee that they will ever be as smart as Acrobat.
The point in font development, especially with OpenType, is to try to make the fonts work as good as possible in *various* systems and applications. This often includes making some compromises or doing redundant steps to make sure that certain information is present in three different places. I wish it were different but *we* don't have any way to change it.
If you don't like the way the Adobe FDK for OpenType writes the cmap table, you can always change it with a tool like TTX or you can use FontLab Studio 5 to build your fonts.

<div class=commentbody>Yes, I know, the last part of my comment was wishfull thinking. TTX would be a nice option but it failse to decompiling and recompiling most of my fonts made with the FDK.
Adam, can you verify some glyph of a FontLab5 standard install will get double unicode mappings?

<div class=commentbody>Andreas,
you can only decompile and recompile a specific table, e.g.
ttx -t cmap yourfont.otf
will produce a file "yourfont.ttx" with only the cmap table. You can edit it, rename to "yourfont2.ttx" and merge into your .otf using
ttx -m yourfont.otf yourfont2.ttx
The result will be a font yourfont2.otf which will contain the new cmap and the rest of the tables will be identical to those in the original yourfont.otf.
In fact, in most cases, you can use one and the same cmap-only .ttx file for the entire family (so you dump and edit once, and then merge it into all fonts in your family that have the same glyphset).
In FontLab Studio 5.0.2, standard.nam (Standard Table) has double-mappings for mu, Delta and Omega, while the AGLFN 1.6 (new) strict table only has the new AGLFN 1.6-compatible assignments. It is explained in the 5.0.2 announcement:
http://fontlab.com/The-News/Announcements/FontLab-Studio-5.0.2/
as well as in the .nam files themselves.

<div class=commentbody>BTW, I have just uploaded slightly revised versions of the .NAM files to:
http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=6147

The archive contains updated .NAM (glyphname-to-Unicode) mapping files for FontLab Studio 5 (and some other of our applications that use these files).
After unpacking these files, please place them on Mac into /Library/Application Support/FontLab/Mapping and on Windows into C:\Program Files\Common Files\FontLab\Mapping .
(Note: Instead doing this, you may also place them into the Mapping folder specified under Options/Preferences / General Options / Folders and paths / Files used by all FontLab products. In this case, the original files that came with your FontLab product will be retained for backup purposes. Please remember that you should place all your user-modified files into this location.)
These files incorporate Adobe Systems’ recent changes to their Adobe Glyph List for New Fonts: the mapping of the “problematic” characters Delta, Omega and mu was changed. The “AGLFN 1.4 (old) strict” table retains the previous mappings (to the "mathematical" codepoints), the “AGLFN 1.6 (new) strict” table includes only the current mappings (to the "Greek" codepoints), while the “Standard Table” now double-encodes the glyphs to map them into both the "mathematical" and the "Greek" slots. The “Standard without afiiXXXXX” table uses uniXXXX names instead of afiiXXXXX names – both sorts of names are valid.
The versions of the files provided here are newer than those included in FontLab Studio 5.0.2. We are making them available for convenience until FontLab Studio 5.0.3 is released.
You can download the archive from:

<div class=commentbody>The fdk is out now, maybe we should open a new thread.
And now my biigest concern. How to setup usWinAscent and usWinDescent to provide the same line spacing between font families and between different version of the same font (Std, Pro)?
I hope this is possible by adding it simply to the OS/2 table.
table OS/2 {
TypoAscender 765;
TypoDescender -235;
TypoLineGap 250;
# usWinAscent 900;
# usWinDescent -350;
} OS/2;
But its not working, why?
Since the old .fpr project file format has changed it would be very usefull to provide us with an example file. Ok, the makeotf.py generates it.
I have some guru meditations on windows.
1. the mystery of -nr
If I use a project file I got lots of the time: [FATAL] unrecognized option (-nr)
But I never used such an option. Is this relateded to unix ascii line breaks?
2. no relative paths under windows?
The makeotf don't accepts relative paths if its called without *.fpr file. But with it, it works with relative paths. - Then cames the mysterious -nr error into play.
3. This message on a test font without feature code.
makeotfexe.exe [NOTE] <xxx> There are -12851 instances of the deprecated "except" syntax in the feature file. Though such statements are processed correctly by this parser for backward compatibility, please update them to the newer "i gnore substitute" syntax. For example, change "except a @LET sub a by a.end;" to "ignore sub a @LET; sub a' by a.end;". (Note that the second rule is now required to be marked to identify it as a Chain Contextual and not a Single Substituti
on rule.)
Conclusion:
Working with *.fpr files seems to work not properly under windows. So I have to wirte good old *.bat files.
I have the feeling you used these scripts exclusivly under unix/OSX.

It's true that the AFDKO 2.0 was mainly tested on Mac, since that's the platform most of us use, but I'm sure Read Roberts did a fair amount of tests under Windows. Nonetheless, like he said on the <a href=http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc1a4d3>Adobe FDK Forum</a>, "the AFKDO v2.0 has been in use for only a few months by three people, so I expect that you will quickly find bugs".</div>

<div class=commentbody>I ran pre-release versions of the FDK under Windows, but I was mostly working with the testing tools rather than production tools (e.g. CompareFamily).
Anyway, off to the new thread.
