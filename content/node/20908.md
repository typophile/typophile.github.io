  during the early 1990s for the CI and navigation system of the BVG (the Berlin transit
  authority). Distributed by FSI [[FontShop]] International.\r\n\r\nFont descriptions
  from FSI:\r\n\r\n<strong>FF Transit Print</strong>\r\n\r\nFF Transit is a highly
  legible font that works well for readers who may need quick orientation while en
  route. It was originally designed by MetaDesign in Berlin for the official use of
  the Berlin Public Transportation Services (BVG) and D\xFCsseldorf Airport, but will
  now be available commercially all over the world. Designed to blend aesthetic quality
  with legibility.\r\nThe FF Transit fonts are based on the Frutiger family (licensed
  from Linotype-Hell). MetaDesign pared the font design down and extended the family
  by creating a new set of matching italic fonts. In addition, they altered the widths
  and spacing of each font to enhance their functionality in different situations.\r\n\r\n<strong>FF
  Transit Front and Back</strong>\r\n\r\nFF Transit Front and Back are designed to
  compensate the visual distortion that appears on illuminated signs which are lit
  from the front or the back, and do so no matter whether the text is displayed as
  a positive or as a negative (white text on a dark background). Transit Front Negativ,
  for example, is thinner and has wider spaces, to balance out the visual illusion
  that negative fonts appear thicker.\r\n\r\n<strong>Transit Pict</strong>\r\n\r\nFF
  Transit Pict contains pictograms, direction symbols and warning symbols. FF Transit's
  extensive collection of pictograms makes it the perfect font for universal orientation
  systems. The pictograms can be used for local public transportation systems, airports,
  companies or on private property. It contains all warning symbols, informational
  symbols and up-to-date pictograms which cannot be found in comparable collections
  of symbols. As a special free bonus, each FF Transit package contains a special
  set of symbols used by Berlin's Public Transportation Services for the various subway,
  streetcar and bus lines. FF Transit Linie is a versatile symbols font which is made
  up of letters, numerals and colored backgrounds that can be combined to form subway
  line signets. The considerable number of FF Transit pictograms is now also available
  for another FontFont typeface designed for orientation and information systems:
  FF Info Pict for FF Info, designed by Erik Spiekermann and Ole Sch\xE4fer.\r\n\r\n<strong>External
