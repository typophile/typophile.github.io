  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello

I've been working on this logo for APCTP the past few days, its for an association that is responsible for the development and management of 4 Science and Technology parks in the northern Portugal. Its an half public half private association. The parks offer space and special facilities to the companies that decide to join them, they have joint resources, shared equipment conference rooms, spa, restaurants, etc.

The kite was selected because of some historical background, like Benjamin Franklin s kite, and although it is a very simple object and shape, it has several utilities from fun to science.

I've been trying to avoid a too technological approach in term of visual language,trying to bypass the grid like typography from computer screens and mobile phones, or the analogical/digital retro, although I've been testing it with some of these fonts, as an assurance.

The version presented here is a sketch, and if possible I would like to hear some opinions

Thanks

If so, I think there's too much whitespace (or should I say bluespace?). The tagline at the bottom is cramped, and the text is too small. If you shrink the logo down, the tagline becomes unreadable.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're totally right about the type, I mistreated it by compromising the readability of the lower text. One of the problems is that the logo APCTP is not self explanatory because its not a well known association so its mandatory to include always the bellow text, but I'll work on a different set and proportion.

About the blue space the idea was to simulate the idea of a landscape an horizon, but it needs to be improved.

Thanks anyway</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that's a definite improvement. The text is very long, so breaking it into two lines seems to be a necessity. I'm not sure about the second line having the dashes on either side, though.

Although the type is bigger, it is now too light; it will still become unreadable if the logo is rendered small. I wonder if you could get away with eliminating the text as part of the logo per se, and instead supplying it as a separate element (optional, depending on the context).

The new <cite>APCTP</cite> has more character. I agree with you that the <cite>C</cite> still needs work; in particular, it seems too squarish compared to the <cite>P</cite>. Also, the crossbar on the <cite>T</cite> looks too thin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just as a sidenote the string of the kite should come from the middle of the quarters of the kite, I think moving it up and curving it would add to the fun element. You might need to consider three lines for the full title if it is required at small sizes, it might actually break better (sense-wise) ASSOCIAÇÃO DO PARQUE/DE CIÊNCIA E TECNOLOGIA/DO PORTO or moving two lines to the right and enlarging it.

Have you tried grounding the letters to the green. Overlapping the letters over a part of the kite. Flopping the direction of the kite.

Just some things that might look nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rui, the version posted on the 27th of August has more potential, IMHO, than does the latest. I second Dan's suggestion for a tail on the kite. I think that if you got rid of the box and allowed the kite to float freely the whole thing would be more organic and less rigid. You could, for instance, do the acronym, string and tail in the light green ... or the acronym in the blue. But I think you'd find getting rid of the box helps loosen it all up. </div>

Hi, This are some versions with the tail, and without the box. The other version of the logo exists to give the client two options. </div>
