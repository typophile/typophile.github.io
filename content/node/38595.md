body: "G'day guys,\r\n\r\nI feel my internet world has shrunk to a very few websites
  which I check really painfully often so, at the risk of finding more ways to waste
  my time at work, I'd like to hear your suggestions for more good design blogs. In
  the past, I have spent a lot of time on <a href=\"http://www.designiskinky.com\">
  designiskinky </a> and that's good, and also the fwis <a href=\"http://covers.fwis.com/\">
  book-cover design blog </a> is great, but I want to widen the net, I'm feeling a
  bit creatively dry and I'm thinking there must be heaps more stuff out there.\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n--N"

    also interesting, but the focus is more on contemporary art with the occasional
    graphic design pieces.\r\n"

  body: "These are really great, thanks again, it's really valuable to have personal
    recommendations of sites that are interesting and helpful, it's hard to know when
    you visit a site once to know whether it will consistently deliver \r\n\r\n-->
    I'm aiming to finish some logo concepts today so these will be waiting at the
    end as a kind of reward, until then I'm holding off, although I had a quick naughty
    look.\r\n\r\nBit of a tangent but kind of related, now that design blogs are so
    readily available do you find you're buying or subscribing to less design mags?\r\n"
