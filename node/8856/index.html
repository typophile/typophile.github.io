		<div class="commentbody">As you say Hrant, it's not the forms or the genesis that are related to fascism. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Form has no relation to politics or ethics &ndash; this is one of the lessons of the 20th century, made clear in the mythical anecdote of the beautiful, functional lampshade made of human skin.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It has also been pointed out that there's a great resonance, in formal aesthetics, between drill sargeant Busby Berkley's Hollwood spectacles, and the Nuremburg Rally as filmed by Leni Riefenstahl. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And in type, the Nazi flip-flop over whether blackletter or humanist typeform was better for the Third Reich is clearly documented in Chris Burke's &quot;Renner&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for genesis, Helvetica is a revival, made in the WW2-neutral Switzerland, of a widely-used genre (grotesque) at least 60 years old at the time (from Akzidenz Grotesque), while its capitals go back at least to the 1830s, in London (as I show in my essay).  There can hardly be a type of less political provenance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The evidence against Helvetica is entirely circumstantial (nonetheless, such evidence can be grounds for conviction). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For those who have not read my essay, the gist of the argument is that the dominant typefaces of today are a limited number of mid-20th Century sans serif faces. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The quality of typography is hence traditional, conformist, utilitarian and banal: these are the qualities of a fascist aesthetic.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helvetica was entrenched in digital culture by the mass-scale distribution of two organizations Apple (as a Laserwriter and system font) and Microsoft (with IE) which enjoy a virtual monopoly &ndash; akin to a totalitarian position. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->While both communism and fascism were totalitarian movements, the communist aesthetic was anti-traditional and experimental (eg Stalin and Mao's democidal collectivization of agriculture). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The origin of the word &quot;fascist&quot; is the Latin word &quot;fasces&quot;, meaning a bundle of reeds (an image used in Nazi regalia). It denotes being bound to the Leader, the Party, the Fatherland, the Ideology.  &quot;Bundle&quot; is also the word used to describe how Helvetica etc. are distributed. Hmmm&hellip;</div>

Helvetica is chosen because people don't want to stand out in a crowd by using something with a unique personality: &quot;timeless and neutral&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Utilitarian.

Eco: &quot;Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural fear of difference.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Utilitarian. The fascist state exists not for the pleasure of its citizens, but to enforce its ideology on the world. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Banality. Eco: &quot;&hellip;the cult of action for action's sake. Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.&quot; This viewpoint follows from Hannah Arendt's perception of the banality of Nazi evil as perpetrated by thoughtless bureaucrats.</div>

<li>Eco is talking about 'Ur-fascism' - his concoction - not fascism.

Your the way in which you - or is it Eco - use 'utilitarean' is incorrect. Utilitarean means useful to people, not useless.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.

		<div class="commentbody">William: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. To distinguish between historical instances of fascisim, and a general ideological form, Eco came up with the term &quot;Ur-fascism'. As he admits: &quot;In spite of some fuzziness regarding the difference between various historical forms of fascism, I think it is possible to outline a list of features that are typical of what I would like to call Ur-Fascism, or Eternal Fascism. These features cannot be organized into a system; many of them contradict each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism. But it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.&quot; Yeah, cultural theory tends to be a bit smoky! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Certainly, Utilitarianism as a philosophy means useful to people (the greatest good for the greatest number). However, the word utilitarian is generally understood to mean &quot;merely&quot; useful for material ends &ndash; inhuman, in fact. It's a put-down, stemming from the realisation in the latter 19th Century that cold-blooded industrial capitalism could easily be rationalized by such a &quot;Benthamite&quot; philosophy, with devastating results for a large number of the population. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. I trust Arendt's assessment. She was at Nuremburg, and her concept of the &quot;banality of evil&quot; makes sense in relation to Milgram's behavioral studies of obedience, from the same era. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helvetica, modernism, and socialism: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there is some overlap, and many ironies. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The grotesque letterform was modern, invented in signage during the birth of the modern industrial era, in London, 1805 (Justin Howes spoke on this at the Bad Type conference). No doubt the sign painters were Chartists (the socialists of the day), but it's more likely that this extreme trend in letterform was just the way that people expressed themselves in the most tumultuous of times. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bauhaus &quot;socialist&quot; ideal you refer to: that the artist has a duty to society. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If that is the case, the duty of artists is to use today's typefaces designed by members of today's society, not Helvetica.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think Arendt ever claimed that Eichmann was 'a thoughtless cog in a bureaucratic machine': the famous banality phrase refers to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->way<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he went about murdering millions of people, having once decided that he would do it (what Eichmann called his 'Pontius Pilate moment'). Arendt is contrasting the reality of this small minded man, obsessing about the train schedules to and from Auschwitz, to the kind of sadistic monster who gets personal pleasure from specific acts of murder (e.g. Stalin's secret police chief, Beria, who insisted on personally executing many 'enemies of the revolution'). Eichmann's Final Solution was designed to depersonalise the murder, by turning it into a bureaucratically ordered, mechanised, assembly line for corpses and ash. And this was something new in our understanding when Arendt wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eichmann in Jerusalem,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the comments of the prosecutor show: we expect people who perform monstrous acts to be monsters, and their ordinariness is apalling. I think Arendt's famous quote mischaracterises evil: it is not that evil is banal per se, but that evil <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> become part of the everyday and the normal. It does not require monsters: Eichmann's system, while it permitted individual sadism, did not require sadism. Nowhere in any of this is it suggested that Eichmann was an unthinking cog in a bureaucracy: he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->designed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the bureaucracy.</div>

She is simply wrong about him having no motives, for he was in fact a fanatical devotee of Hitler.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore, she says, 'in the postscript to Eichmann in Jerusalem&hellip;: &quot;The essence of totalitarian government, and perhaps the nature of every bureaucracy, is to make functionaries and mere cogs in the administrative machinery out of men, and thus to dehumanize them.&quot; In her view, Eichmann was so much the bureaucratic man that he &quot;never realized what he was doing [emphasis in original].&quot;' <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the reality was that, contrary to Arendt, he did realize what he was doing and knowingly choose to do it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Miller, as I quoted earlier, does not think that anyone has made a general claim that people must be specially monsterous to do great evil. In fact in the view of both Judaism and Christianity ordinary people have the capacity for great good and great evil alike, and the choice. The fact that the prosecutor had this view is not indicative that his view is the traditional one, even though it may be common in drama.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The important point here is that you cannot shift the blame from individuals to bureaucracy itself, which is what seems to be the thrust of Arendt's argument, and what Nick and Eco were refering to. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bureaucracy certainly puts pressure on people to do wrong, but so does the rest of life. Some people have more moral courage and some less. Living with bureaucracy is one of the central moral challenges of our times. Arendt says that it is the nature of bureaucracies to dehumanize. But families and rulers could do that before. This pressure is not radically new; what is new is not the pressures but the efficiency of bureaucracy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Her getting it wrong is to the point here, because a knee jerk reaction of many on these discussion boards is to see every bureaucracy and large organization as evil. All have tendencies to evil, but some are largely good and some largely evil, and there are all gradations in between. And it is up to us as part of them or dealing with them to do our part in a good way, and not to cooperate when they are going to do wrong.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I see often on these boards is people totally condemning all corporations and also working for them or with them. This to me is an unsound as well as confused attitude. I would rather see a realization of the pressures, and a consciousness that it is within our power to deal with them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Are you saying that all contemporary designs are better for society than all revivals? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No. I would never be that dogmatic (or fascist). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William, we were discussing something you had raised, the &quot;socialist&quot; element of Helvetica and modernism. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If today's design workers wish to express a socialist sentiment, they should not merely pay lip service by using old Helvetica, but should support their fellow designers (solidarity!), by using typefaces designed by today's type designers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*** <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I haven't read Eichmann in Jerusaslem, and I am not an Arendt scholar. As I am aware, her term &quot;the banality of evil&quot; had a great resonance, to the extent of becoming a cliche. From what I have read of the commentary, including here, it appears that the connection she made between banality, fascism, bureaucracy, and not thinking for oneself made a lot of sense to a lot of people. To repeat one of John Hudson's points: she was contrasting the banality of evil with the sadism of evil. And at the time, when it was customary to demonize and project evil onto the other, her idea of describing evil as banal was a revelation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is, because no-one had taken Eliot seriously when he wrote &quot;This is how the world will end. Not with a bang but a whimper.&quot; (The Hollow Men, 1925) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In connection with typography, what could be more banal than a default choice of typeface, absolving the typesetter of any choice in the matter? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the default is a corporate standard, then it is a strictly bureaucratic banality. If it is made by the software, then it is another kind of banality: although the user is more at liberty to replace the default, how much freedom of choice is there really?  When a graphic designer buys a computer and installs professional software, already (s)he has a default library of typefaces which cleverly appears on the font menu. Of course, (s)he may still buy and install other fonts, but the default library is a coercive banality, no matter how marvelous the fonts may be, because it derogates freedom of choice by taking away the need to exercise it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is this evil? Of course not, because on the moral scale, evil is an extreme, and banal typography is merely a slightly numbing practice.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is it inflamatory to speak of the &quot;banality of evil&quot; and typography in the same breath? Perhaps, but the moral dimension of banality is a genuine concern for many graphic designers and art directors, who are aware both of the ephemeral nature of their individual work and the problematic nature of the hyper consumerism which it promotes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My $.02, for what they're worth: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nick and John's association of Arendt's &quot;banality&quot; with mindless action (and not merely poor taste) is exactly right. There was no question in Arendt's mind that Eichmann was evil, or that he tried hard to please his superiors by coordinating the movement and distribution of rail stock in order efficiently to move Jews to internment centers and finally to the camps, or that he knew where the Jews were headed.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William's secondhand reading of Arendt is wrong. Arendt never argued that Eichmann was an innocent tool; she argued that he was a thoughtless functionary who managed in his own mind and to his great guilt to dissociate performing his tasks and promoting the reputation of his section of the bureaucracy from the gruesome reality of their function. The bureacracy was not to blame. She was making a larger point in the book about &quot;a new type of criminal&quot; who &quot;commits his crimes under circumstances that make it well-nigh impossible for him to know or to feel that he is doing wrong.&quot; Consider the other Nazis who spent the end days of the war destroying the records of their crimes; was this proof that they knew what they did was wrong? Far from it, she answers; it shows no more than that they knew they had lost the war and were aware of what others would think of their conduct once they discovered it, and they were trying to avoid paying the price for their decisions&ndash;nothing more. &quot;Would any one of them,&quot; she asked, &quot;have suffered from a guilty conscience if they had won?&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But that did not negate or excuse their crimes, or the fact that they were criminals. There was no question in her mind about their guilt, and that of Eichmann. She put that conclusion in stark language at the end of the book, when she imagines the better and more honest argument for his culpability the judges in Jerusalem could have put to him when they pronounced their sentence: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

If you want to refute him, then respond to his arguments and to the evidence he cites, which you don't do.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You quote Arendt in part as saying that he was a person who &quot;commits his crimes under circumstances that make it well-nigh impossible for him to know or to feel that he is doing wrong.&quot; And you characterize him as a 'thoughtless functionary', following Arendt. But Miller points out, using the evidence he quotes and I report, that her view is factually wrong - he thought of himself as a complete devotee of Hitler, and acted against his duties as a functionary. Lengthy quotes are not responsive to Miller's evidence, but simply a question-begging repetition of Arendt's views. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I myself find dishonorable in Arendt is that she did not face the issue of Heidegger's culpability in supporting Hitler, but defended him with misleading statements.

		<div class="commentbody">John, thanks for the article, which is enlightening, and to my reading confirms very clearly one place where her theories themselves show moral cowardice.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I said earlier, Arendt was very muddled. You can quote her saying many quite sensible and morally upright things. But also the opposite. And she never forthrightly sorts it out. This is a key to her popularity, in my opinion, as by staying muddled she is able to condemn the Nazis without ever appealing to liberal standards such as truth, democracy, protection of minorities and honest science.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since many intellectuals, including Heidegger, were and are illiberal, this is a clever way to make herself and them them feel righteous without challenging their illiberalism.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Her quoting with approval Cicero saying he would rather be wrong with Plato than hold true views with people he doesn't like is exactly a point of betrayal of liberal standards.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The contrast here with Popper is noteable. Popper deeply admired Plato, but recognized his illiberalism, and so wrote his lengthy attack on Plato's illiberalism in 'The Open Society and Its Enemies'. Of course Popper is not a darling of the illiberal and so not as popular.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, it is he, and not Arendt, whom people in oppressed regimes have read as a beacon of light. When I was at the Popper Centenary conference in Vienna in 2002, it was very touching to hear how people in East Germany and Poland were strengthened and given hope and direction by reading Popper. And now he is being read in China and Iran by the champions of liberty.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The liberal standard is truth, and if your friend is supporting an evil, you don't go with him. And that by the way is not only a liberal standard, but a traditional Jewish and Christian one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My problem with Arendt isn't so much that she compromised her standards as that her standards were compromised.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arendt tried to replace acknowledgement of the truth with another standard of 'thoughtfulness'. But, as Miller also points out, this standard is also rubbish when applied to the Nazi situation. The Nazis were thoughtful. They had a whole system of pseudo-scientific racial theories that justified their actions. And exactly on point they had the 'great' philosopher Heidegger endorsing obedience to the Fuehrer as justified by his system of thought. But they weren't honest.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nick said earlier that cultural history is 'a bit smokey'. Well not when I write it. I try to stick to real facts, and use them as a test of whatever I say. Understanding history of ideas is a very difficult and slippery, but important subject. I have been working in this field for forty years, and I try to follow what the great English liberal, Bertrand Russell, said on this subject. He said that he always tried to be as clear as possible. He understood that the truth often lay behind a fog of mystery and confusion, but he never took the fog for the reality, but rather strived to get through the fog to the reality. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I do strongly disapprove of those like Arendt who reject the standard of truth and generate fog, however beautiful the fog may appear at times.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, I find rather peculiar, Nick, that you put family/lover in one category. What Heidegger did in having an affair with his 19 year old student, then dumping her, threatened his marriage and children, exploited her, and is morally reprehensible. Arendt's behavior of maybe getting her jollies by sleeping with a famous man with a wife and children is also wrong.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You could argue that Heidegger was more culpable than she, as he was the one with the power in the situation. But the idea that she owed him something because he exploited her for sex - or was it for gratitude for the priviledge of being screwed by a famous Nazi - when she was 19 seems to me grotesque.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally a note on one thing mentioned in the article John references. Greif notes that Arendt made something of the fact that Eichmann knew Kant's ethical theories. However Eichmann interpreted the 'categorical imperative' as meaning 'do whatever the Fueherer would approve of, if he were in the same situation'. Um, not exactly true to Kant, an apostle of liberalism and the enlightenment. And very much on point as to what motivated Eichmann, though minimized by Arendt.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->See my post above yours. If you disagree with me over Arendt's views, fine. I think I have the better argument, but I could be mistaken. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But to write that &quot;Arendt's behavior of maybe getting her jollies by sleeping with a famous man with a wife and children is also wrong,&quot; and to condemn her for &quot;the idea that she owed him something because he exploited her for sex,&quot; or out of &quot;gratitude for the priviledge [sic] of being screwed by a famous Nazi&quot; is just gratuitous and mean-spirited. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't think of a better definition of &quot;calumny&quot; than to suggest that Arendt got such a charge out of having adulterous sex with an anti-Semitic fascist that it put her so deeply in Heidegger's thrall to feel compelled to whitewash his crimes for the rest of her life. (By the way, Heidegger did not join the Nazis until 1933, and most of his anti-Semitism would likely have been kept delicately out-of-conversational-bounds during the time he and Arendt were together in the mid- to late 1920s.) Was it wrong to have an affair with a married man? Yes. Does it contradict her later views on judgment and responsibilty that she downplayed Heidegger's flaws even in later life and never lost her devotion to his mind? Yes. Was she therefore a self-hating Jew, harlot, and home-wrecker whose ideas deserve no consideration? No, and it's pretty slimy to suggest otherwise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way: Arendt's take on Cicero means nothing close to what you take it to mean. Read Greif's article again&ndash;or, better, read Arendt's actual essay. Plato does not represent in that passage the &quot;illiberal tyrant&quot; (Cicero would not have looked at Plato that way), and the differences between Plato's views and those of the Pythagoreans were not ones that Cicero's imagined characters could resolve with reference to the facts. Greif is using the passage as a metaphor for Arendt's moral cowardice on the question of Heidegger. Arendt, for her part, simply was arguing that when reason and facts fail, you wind up falling back on character, for better or worse. She was not saying that &quot;when I have to choose between being with a tyrant and being with people who tell the truth, I chose the tryant&quot;; she was saying, if anything, &quot;when I have to choose being right with people of poor character and being wrong with people of good character, I choose to be with people of good character.&quot; That  that position regarding Plato (not hers, but Cicero's) is questionable, and that she let her regard for Heidegger blur her own judgment of his character, in themselves takes nothing away from this point, arguable as some may find it to be. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(It's useful, by the way, to think of this in the context of what was to be the opening epigram to Arendt's book on judging, from Cato: &quot;Victrix causa Diis placuit, sed victa Catoni&quot; [the victorious cause pleases the gods, but the vanquished cause pleases Cato]&ndash;questioning, as I read it, the belief that alignment of one's views with power guarantees the justice or truth of one's beliefs.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There's just no need to take these kinds of swipes at Arendt. Disagree with her, argue with her, but don't churn the swill like that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My rude language on Arendt's behavior was in response to Nick's comment that it somehow mitigated her later behavior. My point, and I acknowledge that my language should have been less angry, is that her behavior as a student in no way excuses her later behavior in relation to Heidegger's reputation. The term 'calumny' implies that what I said is false. But it is true. I offer different interpretations of her affair, and I don't know what is correct, but whatever way you slice it it doesn't come out honorable.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I never said that she was a self-hating Jew whose views don't deserve consideration. They should be considered and rejected.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Miller's argument is not self-contradictory. He is pointing out that Arendt acknowledges facts that contradict her thesis, and she refuses to accept the implications of these facts, which refute her.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You say above: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Nick and John's association of Arendt's &quot;banality&quot; with mindless action (and not merely poor taste) is exactly right.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and &quot;she argued that he was a thoughtless functionary&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You say that my charactization of her view as Eichmann as a &quot;a thoughtless cog in a bureaucratic machine&quot; is somehow off base. How is my characterization different from yours?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore, you are not getting Miller's point. If Eichmann were just doing his job as a bureaucrat, then he would have done what his superior told him. But he went against it because of his fanatical devotion to Hitler, a motive Arendt minimizes, but which was primary.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->More generally, you can distinguish between and weak and strong version of the banality thesis. The weak version is that Eichmann was a shallow and silly man, and not a demonic mastermind. Everyone would accept the weak version, including me. The strong version is that he was a &quot;thoughtless functionary&quot;, as you put it. The strong thesis is false as Eichmann thought about it, and wanted to do whatever Hitler wanted, whatever the moral consequences. Eichmann may have lacked a moral sense, but he was thoughtful to the extent that he knew what he was doing and why he was doing it - to carry out Hitler's dreams.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is significant that, as Grief points out in the article John referenced, Arendt never made clear what she meant by the phrase 'banality of evil'. This muddiness in what she is talking about is what I most object to. It enables she and her defenders so slide between different positions to avoid looking the facts about Eichmann in the face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is muddle-headedness in defence of illiberalism, and its popularity, that I find objectionable.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rub here I think concerns the definition of &quot;thoughtless.&quot; You, and Miller, want &quot;thoughtless&quot; to mean &quot;accidental&quot; or &quot;inadvertent.&quot; On that reading, of course, Eichmann was not &quot;thoughtless&quot; at all. If anything, he was meticulous and even obsessive, a trait he shared with most of the Nazi leadership and bureaucracy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It might surprise you to learn, then, that Arendt, far from minimizing this, agreed with you, and documented this quality of Eichmann thoroughly in her book. To put that evidence against her as proof she was wrong about Eichmann is thus misguided; it doesn't &quot;refute&quot; her if she never argued to the contrary in the first place. Indeed, so far as I know, no one&ndash;not Arendt, not anyone&ndash;argues that Eichmann sleptwalked through World War II and the Final Solution, or that he was hoodwinked or brainwashed into genocide, or that he did not understand the consequences of his actions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Arendt used the term, &quot;thoughtless&quot; meant &quot;ethically mindless&quot; or &quot;without judgment&quot;&ndash;that is, not thinking what one is doing, morally speaking. What Eichmann showed Arendt was that one can know what one is doing and why, yet simultaneously and without guile or irony proclaim contradictory and even pure motives, and even (and monstrously) express astonishment at the lack of gratitude from one's victims (as Eichmann expressed of German Jewish leaders and of his captors) for having done one's job so well.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For Arendt to point this out and trace the consequences of failing to recognize this phenomenon for our moral and political judgment is not at all &quot;muddleheaded.&quot; She is holding something ugly and troubling about the human condition up to the light for inspection. That she called this the &quot;banality of evil&quot; without quite being able to put her finger on its precise definition, or to reconcile it with her other accounts of &quot;radical evil&quot; and the nature of totalitarianism, shows only that she was struggling honestly with something complex but of great signifcance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This doesn't mean that there aren't potential problems with Arendt's account; it just means you and Miller haven't raised any of them by accusing her of minimizing Eichmann's evil.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maurice, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even if you mean 'ethically mindless' and 'without judgment' these terms do not apply to Eichmann. He did believe in an ethical system, namely that of the Nazis, according to which it was good to kill Jews in order to purify Europe of racial pollution. He made an ethical choice, a horrific choice, but a choice none the less, and did it knowingly.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also it is a grotesque irony that the person whom Arendt would probably have taken as the epitomy of 'thoughtful', namely Heidegger, made the choice also to say that his philosophy meant that you should support the Fuehrer completely.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is interesting that, Steve tells me, the reception of Arendt's book on Eichmann was much better in literary circles than among historians, almost none of whom agree with her. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have spent way too much time on this, and it is also off topic, so I will not add to the debate for a few days at least.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On topic, Andreas' and Gerard's comments were very interesting on the typography of the fascist regimes.

		<div class="commentbody">William&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't want to bury Erik's point about fascist aesthetics, and I too have a day job, so let me say this in response to your post, and be done with it: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our disagreement, again, is over the definition of &quot;thoughtful.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I consciously, in command of my facilities, with full knowledge of the consequences of my actions, support an anti-Semitic, pro-&quot;Aryan,&quot; fascist ideology of government and racial purity, and deliberately and meticulously in my bureaucratic support of that ideology design and carry out policies directly or indirectly to destroy Jews, Slavs, the Roma, gays, and others&ndash;AND THEN express genuine bewilderment at the lack of gratitude and appreciation for my efforts and my purity of motive from those victims or their survivors, as all of which was true of Eichmann&ndash;then to call me &quot;thoughtful,&quot; as you and Miller apparently insist upon doing in Eichmann's case, can be true only in the most trivial sense of exhibiting complex mental activity and concentration. (To pick a more directly gruesome example: would you call Josef Mengele's medical experiments on Jewish prisoners, or the vivisection of prisoners by Japanese military surgeons during World War II, &quot;thoughtful&quot;? It seems perverse to do so: &quot;And then, Dr. Ishiyama thoughtfully anaesthetized the patient and removed part of his brain.&quot;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was this monstrous combination of consciousness and thoughtlessness that Arendt witnessed of Eichmann and documented at the Jerusalem trial. Why you and Miller (among many others, I'm sorry to say) continue to accuse her of minimizing Eichmann's monstrousness in the face of overwhelming evidence to contrary mystifies me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moreover, in Heidegger's case, you seem not to want to believe that Heidegger made some important contributions to philosophy, but also made some grievous errors, which errors in combination with his clear anti-Semitism and authoritarianism became the basis for his virulent support for Nazism, and then his stubborn resistance after the war to accepting responsibility for his behavior, or indeed showing much if any remorse for it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is, after all, possible to find some things a person said and wrote &quot;thoughtful,&quot; and others &quot;thoughtless,&quot; &ndash;except, perhaps, again, in the most trivial sense of &quot;thoughtful,&quot; in which any activity that requires higher brain functions is &quot;thoughtful.&quot; (For a recent example of the selective use of Heidegger, read Darin Barney's excellent Prometheus Wired, in which Barney uses Heidegger's ideas about the nature of technology to produce great insight into the consequences of digitizing and networking information.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->More to the point, you and Miller seem determined to believe that Arendt's love and friendship for Heidegger based on his accomplishments could not compromise and overwhelm her judgment regarding Heidegger's serious flaws (or, more brutally, that Arendt could sleep with a brilliant scholar and authoritarian anti-Semite who turned her on to philosophy and later became a more or less unrepentant Nazi, and then afterwards display sympathy for him even in the face of his behavior and unrepentance) without it also completely vitiating any and all of her later philosophical, ethical, historical, and political claims and judgments. (How else to interpret &quot;Arendt is not trustworthy, or right&quot;?) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just don't accept that reasoning, any more than I accept the reasoning that because her description and condemnation of Eichmann's monstrousness doesn't align with what many wanted and still want to believe about him, she must have been &quot;minimizing&quot; Eichmann's crimes. The conclusions simply don't follow from the arguments and evidence. If you think they do, then I guess we just have to agree to disagree, and leave things as they are. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On another note: Erik is right about fascism&ndash;and I know this will get me into trouble with Hrant regarding Bush. It is possible to be authoritarian without being fascist (or any kind of totalitarian). The former has to do with tyranny, self-interest, and subordination; the latter, with ideology and the self-abnegating worship of a nation, race, class, or religion as the vehicle of that ideology. The two may blur together in historical fact (witness Soviet communism), and we may call the leaders of both &quot;dictators&quot; when the totalitarianism contains some kind of Fuehrerprinzip, but the distinction is important nonetheless, especially since IMH but I hope informed O totalitarianism is far more dangerous than authoritarianism.</div>

Wildt found out that Hans Rößner, the Editor-in-Chief at Piper Verlag in Munich at the time Ahrendt wanted to publish her book, had been one of the ideologists in the Reichssicherheitshauptamt III, Schrifttumsstelle Leipzig until 1936, when he left for a university career in Bonn (but remained in touch with the institution that was mainly employed in justifying and grounding nazi ideology).
Wildts publication reveals the correspondence between Ahrendt and Piper/Rößner relevant for the german version of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eichmann in Jerusalem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: i.e. some passages in the text referring to nazis that returned to their previous bureaucratic jobs in the 1950s where criticised by the publishers' lawyers etc.</div>
