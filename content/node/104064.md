  keyboard operation manual for hot metal Devanagari typsetting</a>, dated 1933 [PDF,
  5.06MB]. It''s interesting as an example of the decisions made in adapting a complex
  script to a mechanical typesetting system, and a useful contribution to the history
  of the development of the ''half form'' mechanism, here used not only for conjuncts
  but also to build many of the basic letters in combination with the common vertical
  stroke.'

  body: "Thanks for sharing this, John. I was vaguely aware of Linotype\u2019s modular
    approach, but hadn\u2019t seen all the individual components layed out. I certainly
    did not expect to see the \u0915 split down the middle like that, with its permutations.
    Some interesting compromises \u2014 not always completely happy, but clever nonetheless,
    given the constraints of the technology."

  body: "Some clever modularity. The way that the letters are made up of vertical
    splits is fascinating. I wonder how far we can take these ideas into our own practice.\r\n\r\nWe
    already make our glyphs of reusable parts. But this seems unconventional even
    with that in mind. Exciting! :-)"
