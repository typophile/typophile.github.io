  body: Not clever, just persistent. I thought the &#39;a&#39; and &#39;f&#39; looked
    familiar, so I started scanning the Font Book  serif font pages for the &#39;a&#39;
    letter, starting with Z fonts and working forward &#40;coming from the end of
    the alphabet myself, I like to start there&#41;.  <BR> <BR>If I had started with
    the A font names, I would have found it sooner.
