body: I have begun kerning my font and the test runs at generating .otf and .ttf are
  not including the kerning tables when I open them in InDesign. I know these formats
  support the tables. I have fiddled with the 'Generate Font' options, but to no avail.
  Are there any tricks to this? Maybe some other setting that I could have overlooked.

  body: "1. The topic title is misleading: I am almost sure your lookups are exported,
    but for some reasons aren't working in ID.\r\n\r\n2. You haven't provided enough
    information on settings you used for TTF/OTF output. In particular, important
    options are \"OpenType\", \"Apple\" and \"Old style 'kern'\".\r\n\r\n3. Have you
    registered your kerning lookup for proper language systems (i. e. at least latn{dflt})?\r\n\r\n4.
    I am not an InDesign expert, but as I recall from some older Internet discussions
    there are several bugs/features related with kerning support in ID. These problems
    may vary from version to version. In particular you should check the following:\r\n\r\n--
    does you font support the Windows 1250 (Central European) codepage (i. e. not
    just Windows 1252)?\r\n\r\n-- does your font include any GSUB features except
    your GPOS kerning lookup?\r\n"

    #3; I did not have the GPOS lookup registered to {dflt}. Thanks for the help!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
