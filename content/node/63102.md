body: I need some help identifying this font. I have been searching for a while and
  suspect that this final font was manipulated from a base or starting font in Illustrator.
  If I could find something close that would be helpful. Thank you in advance for
  any assistance.

    like so many techno fonts. You could search Ray Larabie's fonts and probably find
    a similar look to start with.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    were close except for the letter \"A\". I will keep searching a bit and see if
    I can create the \"A\". Thank you for your suggestions.\r\n\r\n- Brian"
