  body: "Hinting is what goes into the font, and rasterizing is the process of taking
    that hinted font and turning it into a pattern of pixels on screen or dots in
    print.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Hinting has some relevance to 600 dpi, but not a ton at normal
    text sizes. Very small type at 600 dpi benefits quite a bit from good hinting
    (think 5-8 pt). At 300 dpi hinting matters a lot. At imagesetter resolutions,
    it matters very little.\"</em>\r\nThomas Phinney"

    noticed few problems in the printing(may be cause of the printer or the paper
    aslo). I also made sure that my original forms are correct. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T_3414.jpg]\r\nThis
    print was taken from a laser printer. ( Not the offset printing )\r\n\r\n"
