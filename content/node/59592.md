body: "Fast Company has a great cover story on Jeff Bezos and the competitive drive
  for the electronic publishing market, with Steve Jobs and Apple as a potential spoiler
  for the Kindle. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/137/the-evolution-of-amazon.html?page=0%2C5|Amazon
  Taps Its Inner Apple]]\r\n\r\n<em>\"Looking long-term, as readers migrate to digital
  books, there is a real possibility the basic form of the book will change. It is
  a process already under way, since the Internet has changed the way people access
  information, content, and entertainment. Evan Schnittman, vice president of global
  business development at Oxford University Press, believes constant connectivity
  is a looming threat to an immersive reading experience. 'I love to read but I know
  I read immersively somewhat less now -- and I'm in the publishing industry,' he
  says. 'E-books are simply print books in digital form and my question is, Will that
  be enough? Is that really what we're going to want to be doing?' \r\n\r\nBy introducing
  the Kindle, Jeff Bezos is emulating Steve Jobs -- and taking him on. If history
  is any guide, no; the decay of the printed word on paper is part of a predictable
  pattern of development. The incipient form of a new technology tends to mirror what
  came before, until innovation and consumer need drive it far beyond its predecessors.
  The first battlefield tanks looked suspiciously like heavily armored tractors equipped
  with cannons; early automobiles were called 'horseless carriages' for a reason;
  when newspapers began serving up stories over the Web, the content mirrored what
  was offered in the print edition. But even as an engineer wouldn't dream of starting
  with the raw materials for a carriage to design a new sports car, books will move
  far beyond paper and ink.\"</em>\r\n\r\nBased on previous Typophile discussions
  on eBooks, I think too many here are still thinking of paper and ink."
