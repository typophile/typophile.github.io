body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whatfontisthis_3808.jpg]\r\n\r\nI would
  SO appreciate some help with this. I've looked at so many font shop sites, looked
  through a few thousand typefaces on my computer and I can't find anything similar.
  \r\n\r\nI am primarily after the face on the left (and would be thrilled beyond
  reasonableness to have it IDed), but I also like the one on the right. Basically
  I am looking for a nice, round sans, something modern -- with at least a light and
  a medium or bold weight. I like the mixing of lower case vowels and capital consonants.\r\n\r\nEven
  if anyone can recommend something similar to these two, that would be super helpful.
  \r\n\r\nThank you all so much!"

  body: I don't think it's Linear, most of the characters don't match. The crossbar
    in the "e", "c" is too closed off etc. I've seen a shareware font that was very
    similar to this, but can't remember where.
