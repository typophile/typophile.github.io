  Heavy. After creating a few text samples, the client said they font was different
  than what they wanted- particularly the \"E\" and \"W.\"\r\n\r\nGoing through my
  old letraset catalogs, I did notice that Serif Gothic Heavy has an alternate \"E\"
  shaped like a horseshoe, and the \"N\" and \"W\" were different from the characters
  in the I.T.C Serif Gothic family. \r\n\r\nIs there any version of Serif Gothic Heavy
  that is true to the letraset font?  \r\n\r\n"

  body: If I'm not mistaken, I don't think there is a digital version of Serif Gothic
    with the alternate characters. Given the fact that ITC has recently released ITC
    Avant Garde Gothic and ITC Bookman with all the extra characters, it seems possible
    they may do the same with some of the others like Serif Gothic.

  body: "Last night after reading your post, I checked out the old 20 lb. ITC black
    specimen book to review all alternate characters for Serif Gothic Heavy. What
    Mark said is true about ITC releasing AGG with all characters, but I think it
    would be a long while before they do anything with Serif Gothic (it's not seen
    as much as their other more popular faces).\r\n\r\nThe big question is what do
    you need it for? A logo wordmark or for a display headline? You may have a few
    options if it is for a logo, but less if they intend to use it consistently for
    display heads. Let us know, maybe we can come up with more suggestions for you."

    library of film fonts is <a href=\"http://www.incipit.com/linkrefs.html\" target=\"new\"><strong>Incipit</strong></a>.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to their catalog they can set ITC Serif Gothic Heavy with alternates. Here is
    a link to their list of fonts in <a href=\"http://www.incipit.com/typositor1004.pdf\"

  body: "Thank you so much for the responses.\r\n\r\nNorbert, I also figured that
    Serif Gothic would be low on their priority list. The client wants to use the
    font for level 2 headings (web), so yes it would be repeated use. \r\n\r\nThank
    you for the links; I'll be reviewing them shortly.\r\n\r\n"
