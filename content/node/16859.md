  it is available to every other program in my G5 Mac with Tiger and via Fontbook2.
  It is even present in Indesign CS!\r\n\r\nI just tested this in other machine with
  same programs and same thing. Scala sans is ok, but this FF Scala is not. Could
  somebody, plz, verify this. If you have got this font, can you use it in InDesign
  CS 2?\r\n\r\nYes I have installed the font again, purged the fontcahche, restarted,
  disabled alla other fonts etc.  There is a font folder in ID application support
  but I think it is common to ID CS  and ID CS 2 so font conflict in this folder is
  not probably the case, or is it? Beats me."

      No luck. This is mysterious! Is Font Agent Pro only way to get this font to
      InDesign? Anyone?\r\n\r\nPS. This has to be sumting to do with ID\xB4s own fonts
      folder. Suppose there is some font which conflicts with FFScala and fontmanagers
      are unable to deal with this. I would ban these application spoesific font-foilders.
      Mrrr..."

  body: "If you're troubleshooting a particular font, I wouldn't recommend switching
    font managers around. In fact, I would recommend disabling any font manager you
    might have running and test the font in the system. \r\nPut the font in /Users/*your
    username*/Library/Fonts/.\r\nWhen I'm testing fonts in this way I keep /System/Library/Fonts/
    with the default Mac OS system fonts and keep /Library/Fonts/ and /Users/*your
    username*/Library/Fonts/ empty except for the font I'm testing. If it shows up
    in Apple's FontBook utility, does that mean that you already have a copy installed
    in the system? When you said that you \"disabled all other fonts\" does that mean
    you deactivated them  in your font manager or that you disabled them in FontBook?
    I wouldn't recommend using FontBook's feature for disabling fonts while using
    any 3rd party font manager. \r\nHow exactly did you clear the system font cache?
    Clearing Mac OS 10.4 font caches will re-enable any fonts disabled in FontBook
    since that is where that property is stored. \r\nThe fact that the font works
    in other applications is a clue that the problem is InDesign CS 2 related. It's
    a fine idea to take other software out of the mix to verify this. In fact, if
    you have to deal with Quark or Adobe support it's important that they don't have
    any other software to blame. You may also want to disable any 3rd party plug-ins
    as well, even though it's unlikely that the issue is related to auto-activation.
    \r\nBoth the OS and applications may cache font data so it could be that the problem
    is related to some CS2 cache. In the past, Adobe applications used \"adobefnt.lst\"
    files to keep track of what fonts were active. I don't think that is the case
    for CS2. Does anyone know?"

  body: "Ohh. I have succeded. \r\n\r\nThe problem was the font. I installed a new
    version (dated 1996) and even CS 2 accepted it, my old was from 1990 with different
    PS-names.\r\n\r\nI suspect that Adobe\xB4s font engine does not like old fonts
    from competitors. Also I noticed that my font folders have got strange Adobe FntXX.lst
    -documents. I wonder why.\r\n\r\nBTW Just trying Suitcase Fusion \u2013 but still
    on FontBook2"
