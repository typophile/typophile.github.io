body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nNot focused on type design itself but an important problem for
  me to resolve.\r\nIs there anyone around here with special knowledge about all the
  problems and difficulties on font embedding in Ex-Macromedias Director?\r\n\r\nLately
  I observed the problems my old movies (that I also use for Internet) have nowadays
  when it comes to IntelMacs.\r\nMy Director is version 9.0 and I am not willing to
  buy the new one only for this.\r\n\r\nSome fonts I embedded years ago actually still
  work good, others yet show up with the base line higher than it should be.\r\nBut
  tricky, only on shockwave 11 with Intel Macs. In the older shockwave versions it
  remains unchanged (so I cannot change the baseline over all)\r\nI believe there
  could be something, some parameter in the font that acts differently.\r\nHas it
  something to do with unicode, a word I heard around?\r\n\r\nIs there anyone who
  knows something about this problem?\r\n\r\nWould be great.\r\nPS I work in FontLab\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nPS2\r\nThe
  typeface shown above is very nice! Compliment for who made it!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    thing.\r\nI do not use Suitcase or a programm similar but I still wonder why I

    lay them in the Library- Font folder) and then not\r\nin Director or at least
    not in a correct way. This font thing, I mean the technical side on OsX I never
