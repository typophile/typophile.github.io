so glad i found this place!

been looking for experts
in typography so i could
bounce ideas off of them,
and get feedback on stuff.

and this looks like that place.      ;+)

i write e-book programs --
authoring-tools and viewers.

my aim is to incorporate the
best of p-book typography...
so i've tried to learn about it.

i respect the centuries of craft.

i want to carry a lot of it forward.

i'm also willing to leave things
behind, as no longer needed,
but i want to know i'm doing it,
and doing it for good reasons...

i do believe you can break the rules 
creatively even without knowing 'em;
if it works, it works, regardless if you
knew why it "shouldn't" work or not...

but i love p-book typography, so i've
been quite willing to learn the rules...

after all, it's only natural to be
curious about what you love...

***

i'm about to release some stuff that
i would love to have you look at, and
give me feedback on.  in the meantime,
i've been spouting off in a few threads
about "what book typographers think",
and it'd be great if you let me know of
any specifics that i've gotten _wrong_...

one thread is over at the "if:book" blog
-- future of the book --  on a blog entry
asking "why is text on screens so ugly?"
i made a couple of long comments there.

the second thread is on the "toc" blog
-- "tools of change" at the site of o'reilly,
the computer-book publishers -- where
i discuss a free book they just released to
demonstrate print-on-demand at a show.
i tell them all the things they did _wrong_,
from the perspective of a book-designer,
so i'd appreciate if you told me what _i_
got wrong.  you can do it there, or here...

i'll put specific url's in a follow-up post,
just in case they would hold up this one.

and when i release stuff into the wild,
i'll let you know so you can kick my ass
with some of your excellent feedback...         :+)

- the choice between sans and serif is not any more important than the specific choice of fonts: even if you prefer one or the other, there are lousy and better choices in either camp.

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Like ebook design, pbook design is a compromise between the convenience of the reader and the limitations of the production process.
The single biggest factor determining the production cost of pbooks is length: more words equals more pages, and more pages equals more paper, more press time, and more shipping weight. Justified columns are designed to fit the maximum number of words on a page, which in turn keeps the page count to a minimum. There's no justification for justification in ebooks, because there's no paper, press time, or shipping. 
Paragraphs beginning with an indented first line are another device to minimize length and save paper. Flush-left paragraphs with an extra line or half-line above make sense for ebooks.
Aggregating metadata into frontmatter (the pages with Roman-numbered folios at the front of a pbook) is likewise an artifact of the space limitations of paper. Put the copyright notice on a splash screen, like other software products, or link it to menu bar or toolbar. 
The table of contents in a pbook is the ancestor of the home-page menu. Its column of page numbers is a navigation tool that pbooks required, but on ebooks it's as anachronistic as a foghorn on a space ship. Pbooks are littered with navigation and search tools (numbered pages, numbered footnotes, figure and table references, indexes) that were ingenious workarounds to the space limitations of the paper page, but don't belong in a hyperlinked medium. 
What pbook design conventions <em>should</em> we preserve or adapt for ebooks? Readable fonts, for sure, but what's considered readable is a moving target. Gutenberg cut blackletter type for his Bible because that's what 15th Century readers were comfortable with. When John Baskerville introduced his eponymous type in the 1750s, critics wailed that it would cause blindness in readers accustomed to Caslon. Given time, ebooks will evolve their own optimal letterforms, and readers may even set preferences for the font, size, and leading they prefer.
One thing that seems fairly constant is line length, not measured in inches (or centimeters or picas), but in characters. The comfort zone seems to fall somewhere between 50 and 75 characters per line. Since ebook publishers have no minimum or maximum number of pages to worry about, they should optimize line length and let the number of lines be whatever it needs to be. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">thomas said:
>   yes, hyphenation of ragged-right text is a legitimate choice.

for much of the infrastructure now in place, especially
hand-helds like the iphone, e-book programs simply
don't have enough firepower to do hyphenation well.

so i advocate turning off hyphenation entirely...

people are used to the absence of hyphenation,
since most of the web hasn't been using it at all.

plus, in the "toc" ("tools of change") .pdf that i was
analyzing, the hyphenation was quite atrocious, so
my advice to turn it off was extremely well-founded.


>   So is multi-line composition/line-breaking of ragged right text 

i absolutely agree that a multi-line method must be used.

and you can achieve a very nice even rag if you do multi-line...
(at least in english, with bad-line exceptions being fairly rare.)


>   a more even rag is considered desirable by many typographers.

i agree that it is very important,

and i restate that a multi-line method can give it to you...

(and even if it couldn't, we still don't have the firepower
in our hand-held machines to do hyphenation correctly.
so we're stuck here.)


>   the choice between sans and serif is not any 
>   more important than the specific choice of fonts: 

certainly.  i was merely relating the common advice, which is
to use a serif font for body-text, and sans-serif for headers.

yet -- like you -- i prefer sans-serif myself.  (and i said so.)

but again, with e-books (and print-on-demand for p-books),
all these either/or choices need to be decided by the _reader_,
not by the _creator_ of the book.

(and it is because of its fixed nature, which does not permit
a reader to control these variables, that i hate .pdf so much.)


>   I prefer sans for most current ebook settings, but 
>   I’d sooner be eviscerated with a spoon than

and thus the importance of letting the reader decide...        :+)

(but you were exaggerating a little bit.  weren't you?)          ;+)


>   “mixed” mode (cross between “indent” and “block” mode

well, after you've seen how it looks, you'll probably change
"most typographers barf" to "almost all typographers barf".

but it paves the way to consider a reasonable "compromise",
which is to indent the paragraphs _and_ leave "space above"
each paragraph, just as most book-typographers do, right?

and you can probably guess where i'll go with that, which is
to let the reader decide how much "space above" will be used.


>   have you consulted a lawyer about the repercussions

i try to "consult a lawyer" as little as possible.

and most _especially_ the copyright lawyers...

plus i'd be wary of any advice that anything is "a bad idea"
due to a need to "warn people up front of the copyright",
because "copyright warnings" are now a laughing-stock...

at any rate, here's what the government has to say:
>   http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.html#intro

under "position of notice" it says:
>   The following locations and methods of affixation 
>   are examples of appropriate position of notice. 
>   These examples are not exhaustive.

it gives these examples, under "works published in book form":
>   Title page
>   Page immediately following the title page
>   Either side of the front or back cover
>   First or last page of the main body of the work

so it looks like the last page would be fine.

or, if an e-book falls in the class of "works reproduced
in machine-readable copies", the first example there is:
>   With or near the title or at the end of the work

so again, it looks like the last page is fine.

but, you know, i'm not a lawyer, and i'm glad i'm not,
so if _you_ want to consult a lawyer, it won't be me...

again, thanks for the feedback thomas...

i've found tracking isn't much good
when placing text on-screen.

first of all, negative tracking is awful.
so bad i think nobody would like it...

and some people might not _mind_
positive tracking, but realistically,
it just doesn't help too much either.

yes, first-line indents...

and my impression is that _most_
book-designers use "space above"
on the paragraph _in_addition_to_
the standard first-line indentation...

but i can't point to a support reference
for my position.  can you, for yours?

great!  glad that this thread is entertaining you!

and you get extra credit for coming up with
a topical link -- a comic from _today_ --

so i now have to take away the extra credit
_and_ dock you two additional points as well.
sorry, but those are the rules of the luddites...     :+)

however, you _can_ get one of those points
returned, if you mail me -- yes, snail-mail --
a self-address-stamped-envelope (number 10).

um, yes, you do.  go demand it from your boss.
if s/he gives you any trouble, just tell them that
the lowercase poet said it, so it _must_ be true...
it'll be completely convincing and win your case.

however, if you work for a major publishing house,
you'll be laid off next quarter anyway, so it would be
better to skip the raise and just go find another job.

		<div class="commentbody">I personally encourage e-book development quite fervently. And yes, many rules need to be seen for what they are: dumb legacies. One way an e-book should improve over the hardcopy legacy is that instead of presenting text on recto and verso pages that are flipped in pairs, the text columns should be presented in a continuous horizontal sequence (breaking only where it makes content sense).

My strongest bit of advice however is this: you will only serve your own ego, and never any reader, by classing your artistic expression above humble functionality, clear communication. Design is about servitude, not expression; being made by a human for other humans, personal expression will surely come out, but it must be allowed to do so only <em>in spite</em> of you.

you seem to be confusing my posts

they exist only to accent your content.

1) I worry that there's a relationship. You are, after all, one person.
2) If you want us to read your posts easily, you will subvert your artistry and accommodate <em>other people</em>. You might think we're making a mountain of a molehill, but we care about details here, about optimal functional performance. It's not the only thing we care about, but many of us don't encourage making functionality a lower priority.

> i don’t need it that badly.

You should consider that we cannot provide what you might need badly: blind gushing admiration. If you want to flame artistic, this is simply the wrong place, I'm sorry to say. Actually, I'm not sorry to say!

> I won’t help people who incite or encourage piracy.

Maybe we can -and should- help them
see the damage that piracy causes?

Or is this case hopeless?

--

Bowerbird (note the cap), do you have any reaction to my columns idea? I wanted to get the elephant in your room more exposure first, but I do have some more technical ideas (like concerning resolution, tracking, etc.), I just don't want them to go to waste at your ego altar. Can you handle it?

what i was "inciting and encouraging" (in that other thread)
was _some_thought_ about the _reality_ of the situation...

but, you know, if you'd rather stick your head in the sand,
or run away, feel free.  you're not the first person to do that.

let me repeat the crux:  the pirates laugh at your impotence.

(and me personally?  there's so much bona-fide free content
out there already that i feel absolutely no need to _pirate_,
or to buy anything at all from the corporate content cartel.
as for fonts, i'm gonna use helvetica, because i would _love_
to see you eviscerate yourself with a spoon some day.)       :+)

there's no need to worry.  absolutely no need at all.

i promise.  (well, not unless you _want_ them to.)

let me proclaim it -- loudly and clearly -- for all to hear:
if you don't like my lowercase posts, then don't read them.

or, in other words, i don't care if you read my posts or not.

indeed, if lowercase bothers you, please just move along.
you will be doing both of us a favor.  yep, it's a win-win!


>   You might think we’re making a mountain of a molehill

no, i think you're trying to bully me into conformity.      :+)

and probably not the last.  but trust me, you won't succeed.

yeah, right, hrant, that's _exactly_ what i came here for,

to tell you the truth, i wasn't exactly sure what you meant.

and i'm still not sure.

but perhaps you mean the way your website is structured?

i think it stinks.

if i came across a whole freakin' book like that, i would
give it to thomas, in the hope he would eviscerate himself.

there's no question i can handle you.

i'm not sure you can handle _me_, though...        :+)

instead of about something that's on-topic,
because i can rip personal stuff to shreds.)

Well, that <em>is</em> a worrisome attitude for someone who programs stuff that should be read. Do you have a split-personality thing going on? Or do you consider your posts to Typophile to be poetry, and separate from work?

Bowerbird, with a mind as closed as yours, don't think you'll ever learn anything. But it seems like you don't want that anyway. And by the way, it might help not to call the very people whom you turn to for feed-back "sissies", like you just did on that other thread.

If you don't mind using crap, sure. And if you can't taste that it's crap, that's not anybody else's fault. Oh, and Helvetica?! {Makes coughing sound that sounds suspiciously like "loser".}

Of course that's not what I meant. I meant that the artist in you might be too strong to tame when it comes to anything you do. Including pretending to engage in discourse.

without disputing your point about justification as a
space-saving device, some people also believe that it
aids readability.  and there's also the other point that
-- whatever reasons that caused it to come about --
it's been here a long time and people now prefer it...

so i'm not sure we can discard it so lightly...


>   Paragraphs beginning with an indented first line are 
>   another device to minimize length and save paper. 

this one i'm even less sure about.  there is a need to
indicate paragraphs, and indentation is a good way.

indeed, indentation is better than "block" paragraphs
(a blank line between paragraphs) in some respects...
(e.g., if paragraph-break and page-break co-occur.)

if all we wanted to do was "save paper" then pilcrows
would be what we'd choose, and nobody uses them...


>   Flush-left paragraphs with an extra line or half-line 
>   above make sense for ebooks.

just because it has made me curious, why do people
specify "flush-left" like you did right there?  how else
besides flush-left would you think it could be done?

centered?  flush-right with a ragged-left margin?

surely nobody would suggest those for a _book_.


>   Aggregating metadata into frontmatter (the pages

i'm not sure that i see how frontmatter "saves pages"...
(and the different numbering convention can't matter.)

except an electronic-book is _not_ "a software product".
at least we don't want people to perceive it in that way...

not quite so sure about that.  sure, in an e-book,
we want hotlinks, and not (just) pagenumbers...
(more about that _just_ right there in a little bit.)

more on this below, but what's telling here is your
perceptive observation; p-books are "littered" with
"ingenious workarounds" for navigation and search.

that's telling because it informs us that navigation
and search are _important_aspects_ with any book.

indeed, i've called _navigation_ the most important
aspect of a book.  might be a stretch.  or might not.

i dodge that "moving target" with one very simple tactic;
i let the end-readers decide which font they want to use.
that makes them happy, and that makes me happy too...

that time is now.         :+)

right.  that's the result found by most of the experiments.
(although it's interesting that 75 is 150% of 50, meaning
there's a pretty big range regarding this "comfort zone".)

the 3 lines in the above paragraph are almost 60 characters.
i break almost all of my lines in that 50-75-character range.
and -- at least on some boards -- that pisses people off...
you wouldn't believe how angry they get about it.  or maybe
you would, since some of you are that mad about my casing.
(imagine if you were that mad about _both_ of those things!)

at any rate, this is another of the variables i let readers decide.

and sometimes, it depends on the specifics of the situation...

if you're reading on an iphone, for example, or even a kindle,
that odds are that if the text is at a size you find comfortable,
the line-length might be at the short end of the comfort zone.

for instance, we could consider a p.r. picture from amazon,
showing a screenful of text as it gets displayed on the kindle.

here's that text, with each line's character-count to its right:
>   he was slow in learning how to talk.  "my /41
>   parents were so worried," he later recalled, "that /50
>   they consulted a doctor,"  even after he had begun /50
>   using words, sometime after the age of 2, he /44
>   developed a quirk that prompted the family maid /47
>   to dub him "der depperte," the dopey one, and /45
>   others in his family to label him as "almost /44
>   backwards."  whenever he had something to say, /46
>   he would try it out on himself, whispering it softly /52
>   until it sounded good enough to pronounce aloud. /48
>   "every sentence he uttered," his worshipful /43
>   younger sister recalled, "no matter how routine, /48
>   he repeated to himself softly, moving his lips."  it /52
>   was all very worrying, she said.  "he had such /46
>   difficulty with language that those around him /46
>   feared he would never learn."1 n/a

and here's a screenful of text as shown on the sony reader:
>   boredom. thursday afternoons were usually a big /47
>   peach day, with women getting ready for sunday /46
>   cobblers, but not a soul stopped. n/a
>   t. ray refused to let me bring books out here and /49
>   read, and if i smuggled one out, say, lost horizon, /51
>   stuck under my shirt, somebody, like mrs. watson /49
>   from the next farm, would see him at church and say /51
>   "saw your girl in the peach stand reading up a storm. /53
>   you must be proud."  and he would half kill me. n/a

so we're at (or below) the low end of the 50-70 "comfort zone".

as you can imagine, the counts go down more with the iphone,
and down even farther on the phones with even smaller screens.

but newspapers have small columns too, so it's not a problem...

we have the opposite problem with the big monitors nowadays.
they are now far too wide to present a comfortable line-length.

(which is why blogs, and sites like this one, now use columns,
such that the _real_ content uses up about 1/3 of the screen,
with the rest splattered with nonsense and ads and more b.s.)

but that "problem" now presents us with a great opportunity...

our monitors are wide enough to do a _facing-pages_display_.

a 2-page view returns us to the familiar mode of the p-book...
with each page being shown big enough for pleasant reading.

moreover, this 2-page view is useful with an e-book because
it allows _one_ of the pages to "drop away" in those situations
where we need some screen-space for some other purpose...

for instance, let's say the user wants to see the contents page.
you "drop away" one of the pages, so as to show the contents.
this allows the person to "remain in contact" with the body text
-- via the page which has not "dropped away" -- yet still have
room for the other purpose.  having this room as "workspace"
comes in handy in all kinds of situations -- where the person
wants to view a larger version of a picture, or cycle through all
the book's pictures, or when they want to make an annotation,
or if they want to view pages from different parts of the book,
or any number of other situations that arise in the experience...


>   Since ebook publishers have no minimum or maximum number 
>   of pages to worry about, they should optimize line length and 
>   let the number of lines be whatever it needs to be.

if we were going to "switch over" entirely from paper to screens,
and all the paper-books were to disappear overnight, and we
would never ever print out a book again for the rest of our lives,
then we could throw out all of our past rules and _start_over_...

but that's not our situation.

we need to have a more-gradual transformation...

so we need to do some more thinking...  more on that later...

unless you're reading my source-code, why would you care?

look, it's pretty simple, so i'm sure that even you can understand:
it you enter mixed-case text into my programs, the .pdf output
and the .html output will be mixed-case text.  just like the input.

but if you have any more questions, i'll be happy to answer them.

the casing of my posts to this forum, or any other forum,
do not have any effect on the output of my tools.  none.
zero.  zilch.  nada.  absolutely no effect.  at all.  capiche?

is there anyone else who needs clarification on this fact?

hey, i agree.  how did helvetica ever make its reputation?
i think it's a crappy font.

you know a font i like?  comic sans.  that's a nice clean font.
i don't know why people hate it so much.  i think it's funny.
puts me in a good mood every time i see type in comic sans.

but most of the time i use the mac font, lucida grande.
occasionally i choose verdana.  that's another nice font.
and when i have to use a serif, i usually choose georgia.
the best things bill gates ever did were (1) verdana, and
(2) georgia, and (3) making a charity to fight malaria...

i doubt you want to hear a description of my navel.

and i _can_ tell you what a good font looks like.
in fact, i just did.  i like comic sans.  looks good.

but hey, i don't need to impose my taste on _you_.
or on any of my users.  or on any of their readers...

so i let the authors pick _whatever_ font they want,
as long as they have it on their machine, legal or not.

then i let the readers pick whatever font _they_ want,
as long as they have it on their machine, legal or not.
including comic sans.


>   But that’s the only reason you’re here.

now, hrant.  you remember what your psychologist said
about keeping your projection in check, don't you?             :+)
