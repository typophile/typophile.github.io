    just graduated from design school let me tell you that a year is barely enough
    time to get one\u2019s feet wet. You might be better off working in a marketing/design
    depart or firm and taking classes on nights and weekends for a few years."

  body: "work in your feild at a design studio and get in that way is my best bet.
    \ No 1 year course can prepare you for it, but as a smart person with passion,
    I bet you'd learn better from designers themselves than in the classroom anyway.\r\n\r\nI'm
    taking a 3-year program and I've seen the graduates from it, unless you work very
    very hard ,even 3 years isn't enough\u2026"
