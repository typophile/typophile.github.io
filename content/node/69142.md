  body: "I think you just have to find the <em>right</em> Baskerville. I think this
    extra bold weight may be the one from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/old-baskerville/|TypeShop]]
    (QBF), which often has heavier weights than most foundries. This looks like it
    was the Roman version slanted, rather than actual italics. This font name suggests
    it is based on Baskerville Old Face, or Fry's Baskerville.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
