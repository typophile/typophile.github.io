  body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nYou should upload a picture where we can actually read the
    glyphs.\r\nSeems to be written \"luanvi\", in Helvetica Bold or something similar.\r\n\r\nI'm
    pretty sure the 8 is custom-made.\r\n\r\nThat said, looking for a font with only
    one glyph is a bit like searching a car's name with only a pic of the front fender.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck."
