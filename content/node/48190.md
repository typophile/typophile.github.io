body: "While not mind-bogglingly impressive this super old Unger design looks sophisticated
  enough this if it were released this very day it would not feel out of place. (a
  lo-fi Kontrapunkt condesed?)\r\n\r\nHe also has readability down-packed... notice
  the ink traps and slabs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NAGO_PB00672a_X_1114608828_4054.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.hetnago.nl/object.php?id=10666\r\n\r\nBut
  the best part?...\r\n\r\nNotice his handwriting. Don\u2019t you need that!? I do.
  Mr. Unger needs to digitize it right now.\r\n\r\nSquatty x-height, low contrast,
  and semi-connections. What\u2019s not to love!\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    Berranger Hand</a>.

  body: "It is a counter-proposal, Unger\u2019s reaction to the <a href=\"http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/new_alphabet\">New
    Alphabet</a> by [[Wim Crouwel]].\r\n\r\nUnger wrote:\r\n\r\nResult differs too
    much from the original.\r\nToo many subtleties become lost.\r\nFor the old forms,
    one needs to invent new subtleties that can be reproduced well by the new machines."

    From what I understand, he does all his work on screen much like Matthew Carter.\r\n\r\nMikey
