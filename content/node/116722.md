    I will be releasing my version of same in the next two or three weeks.

  body: It's also similar to Ringlet by MacKellar, Smiths, and Jordan. A font I can
    buy that displays well on the web would be nice.

  body: "Thanks, Don and Nick, for your work.\r\n\r\nI'm a typeface ignoramus, so
    ignore me if it's appropriate, but what prompted your change to the lowercase
    'o'? Did the inner curly thing not display well at smaller sizes? Just curious."
