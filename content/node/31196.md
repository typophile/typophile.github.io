body: "(Pardon for cross-posting)\r\n\r\nI have just produced Nadyezhda SL One, a
  special version of the Bitstream Vera Mono font, originally designed by Jim Lyles.
  \r\n\r\nThis font is intended for testing of OpenType Layout features support in
  an application. Using a special test string (see README.TXT included in the ZIP
  archive for details), the user can selectively turn on and off OpenType features
  in the application's UI and observe which OpenType feature tags are being applied
  to the text. Each feature includes one lookup that substitutes two particular Latin
  lowercase letters with a special glyph that shows the feature tag associated with
  that feature. All lookups are GSUB LookupType 4 (ligature) lookups and are registered
  in the Latin (latn) default languagesystem. \r\n\r\nThe font implements all OpenType
  feature tags registered in the OpenType specification version 1.4, as well as two
  unregistered tags: \"ss21\" and \"ss22\". \r\n\r\nNote that many OpenType Layout
  features should not be implemented this way in real-world fonts. For example, the
  \"nukt\" (Nukta form) feature only makes sense when registered in an Indic script,
  not in the Latin script. Many of these features should be applied automatically
  in certain language/script contexts by the OpenType Layout engine, and this font
  is not suitable for testing such behavior. Also, the recommended implementation
  for many features is to include positioning lookups rather than substitution lookups,
  and this font also does not fulfil these expectations. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, the
  font is useful for testing issues such as:\r\n* Which OpenType features are <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/31140\">active
  by default</a> in my application? \r\n* When triggering a particular UI item for
  applying a certain feature, is the expected feature being actually applied?\r\n*
  Does my application have human-readable UI labels for all possible OpenType features?\r\n*
  Are the human-readable UI labels for OpenType features localized into other languages
  in a sensible way?\r\n\r\n\"Nadyezhda\" is Russian for \"Hope\". Along with \"Vera\"
  (which was also the original name for this typeface, and is Russian for \"Faith\")
  and with \"Lyubov\" (\"Love\"), they form the three Biblical virtues, and rank among
  the most popular Russian female given names. \r\n\r\nThe font is available FREE
  OF CHARGE and is released under a generous Bitstream license, allowing derivative
  works (as long as \"Bitstream\" or \"Vera\" are not in the names), and full redistribution
  (so long as they are not *sold* by themselves). See COPYRIGHT.TXT included in the
  ZIP archive for license details.\r\n\r\nYou can download Nadyezhda SL One from:\r\nhttp://www.silesian.com/"
