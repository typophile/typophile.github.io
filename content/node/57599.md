  since it is gonna be just ~10mins, i was thinking about showing mostly pictures
  of his works.\r\n\r\ni already had a look at all the online material but was wondering
  if any of you guys might have offline material like articles, posters or even pages
  out of a book?\r\nit just looks better than the internet stuff :)\r\n\r\n\r\ncheers
  and thanks for taking the time,\r\n\r\ndmd."
