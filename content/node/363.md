body: I just look at this little puppy in admiration. It is a wonderful instrument,
  and it lives in my pencil case. <BR> I am wondering if the numerals are from a specific
  typeface, because I love them equally as much as my ruler!  <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/11783.jpg"

    target="_blank">DIN Rounded</a> with wonderful <BR>numerals, but it was bought
    by Albert Jan Pool, creator of <BR>FF DIN. Hopefully we&#39;ll see it in FF&#39;s

  body: By the way, I assume this ruler wasn&#39;t produced with type <BR>that is
    rounded, but appears as such after the impression <BR>was made. Nevertheless,
    I assume you&#39;d like to emulate <BR>what you see, so absolute correctness be
    damned!

  body: golly, you chaps are rather quick!  <BR> <BR>&#62;By the way, I assume this
    ruler wasn&#39;t produced with type that is rounded <BR> <BR>Maybe so, but upon
    very close inspection they aren&#39;t semi-circular rounds, but more like truncated
    curves. But thanks anway people!
