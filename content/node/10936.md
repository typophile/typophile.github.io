body: Hello, please be brutal. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s for the company I work for. We primarily
  have past experience doing entertainment work &#40;club/theatre promotions etc.&#41;
  but are moving into corporate design and a new office with it. <BR> <BR>The idea
  of this logo is to show the company as being made up of two cells of the same genus,
  with a different logo for both departments. The typeface is based on the cell motif
  and if successful I will make a full set for the smaller type and other promo material
  etc. &#40;at the moment I have used Eurostile as it is superifically similar&#41;.<img

    Do the same for your figures, less wider, sae open terminals <BR> <BR>Make your

  body: Thanks for your input. <BR> <BR>Maybe I should have said brutally honest?
    Was your first statement brutally honest or just brutal? <BR> <BR>Anyway, assuming
    there is some hope left for this design, below are ammendments I have made based
    on your comments. Top is the original, second is a removal of all the terminals
    &#40;its hard to see, but both caps and non-caps have little up-turned terminals
    in the original which softens them a little&#41;, the third one is an attempt
    to compensate the terminals by making the Caps terminals less pronounced but still
    upturned and the last one is the same as the third but with the caps horizontally
    scaled even more. I&#39;m reluctant to do this because I wanted the letters based
    on the logo I had designed but maybe I&#39;m just clinging on to a bad idea...<img

  body: 'Good typographic suggestions from JFP. Yeah, I&#39;m not real fond of it
    either. I think my main objection is the amount of stuff happening. You&#39;ve
    got the icon, there&#39;s the word century, and 23 and a scentence.  IMHO 4 is
    rather a lot of elements for a logo. <BR> <BR>There are several things you might
    try.  <BR> <BR>1&#41; Try it without the mark, and focusing on the words Century
    23 and the tags. <BR>I&#39;m just not buying the 2 cells of the same genus business.
    I guess I understand the motivation with two business focuses, but in practice
    I don&#39;t know that your logo is communicating that, or even needs to. <BR>
    <BR>2&#41; Maybe eliminate the space between Century and 23 -&#62; Century23.
    Either that or make the 23 your mark and really go for it. <BR> <BR>3&#41; The
    scentences. The placement is off. It looks like the tail of the y was giving you
    fits :-&#41; I would take these out too &#40;if possible&#41; and let the color
    differentiate. Are you talking two different companies, or just two aspects of
    your business? If the latter, I&#39;d fight to drop the words all together and
    at most differentiate with color. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve made alot of assumptions about
    your business, so feel free to tell me to take a walk. In closing though, &#40;and
    you&#39;re talking to type nuts&#41; since you&#39;re designing your own type
    for this logo &#40;and possibly a corporate font&#41; make this your focus. Take
    JFP&#39;s suggestions and really work the type over until it shines.  <BR> <BR>For
    ideas look at Oban and Metron in these forum for some inspiration. I think they
    lend themselves to a logo like yours: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/962.html?1016189501"

    <BR> <BR>BTW, your project also reminds me of an ID that Duffy Design did for
    MYND using different colors for differend depts. In was in some annuals and also
    at <a href="http://www.duffy.com" target="_blank">www.duffy.com</a>. <BR> <BR>Regards,

    abstract symbol because there can not be any concrete interpretation about what
    you do. And that
