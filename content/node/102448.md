  body: "I wonder why it needs serifs at all. They look like an add-on. This work
    reminds me of the nineties, when it was utterly cool to chop off the serifs from
    serifed fonts. Look at David Carson\u2019s layouts for Ray Gun. I see the different
    approach here in Mixtra. The type could do well without the additional serifs.
    However, me thinks the S and s are too light weighted at the top and the R\u2019s
    head should be bigger."

  body: "I would have to agree with J Weltin. It has some interesting forms, but it
    looks like it can't quite figure out what it is. It would play for the locals
    here.\r\n\r\nI am no expert, however."

  body: It looks to me as if the serifs have been chopped off rather than added on.
    Overall it looks uncomfortable or unfinished or just not right. The italic looks
    more resolved than the upright.

  body: "I essentially agree with you guys.\r\n\r\nThis is a style that's hard to
    pull off - but I don't think its impossible. Maybe angling the serif-less terminals
    would help. For example in the \"fl\" ligature in Patria (where instead of fusing
    the letters I removed the head half-serif of the \"el\") I think that makes a
    big difference.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nToday, learn about the Armenian
