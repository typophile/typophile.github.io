body: "The help/support PDFs I found at winsoft.eu indicated that it was possible
  to work in Roman/left-to-right languages by changing a few preferences in InDesign
  CS3 ME (Middle Eastern edition). The question I have is if this is advisable for
  someone who is currently working primarily in the standard version of Indesign CS3
  for English and other Western European documents, who only occasionally needs to
  edit text in Arabic (this user is currently sending out the files for translation
  and text placement, and receiving outlined glyphs for placement as EPS files...kind
  of a mess). Also, this user is operating a Mac, if that is important (the translating
  company indictated that it might be).\r\n\r\nAlso, would it be a practical solution
  to install InDesign CS3 ME under an alternate user account, and just switch accounts
  as needed? Would this fubar the preferences for one or both of the editions of InDesign?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, I realize this is sort of a complicated mess.\r\nEnrico"

    and not 'by  changing a few preferences', just the type tool  (ME Type Tool vs.
    Type Tool).\r\n\r\n> is advisable for someone who is currently working primarily

    So if you take this path you might find information coming in on new versions
    of the Western release that you can't handle.

    Polish, Russian, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic -- works equally well. Also, as far as
    I can tell, all plugins that work with InDesign U.S. English also work with InDesign
    Middle East. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    CE (Central European) version, if you apparently can assign Polish and Russian
    dictionaries in ME, too?\r\nIs it just about the user interface language?\r\nThanks,

  body: "Since InDesign CS2, Russian, Polish and Greek dictionaries are included in
    the regular U.S. edition of InDesign. The language-localized Central European
    versions of InDesign made by Winsoft include some extra features for those languages
    (extra dictionaries, better sorting of indexes etc.). The Middle Eastern version
    of InDesign includes ALL those extra features for Central European languages as
    well. \r\n\r\nBefore InDesign CS2, there was a separate Central European version
    of InDesign because the U.S. edition only had dictionaries for Western languages.
    \r\n\r\nA."

    \u2013 you\u2019re right; Polish and Russian, among other Central European languages,
    are included. D\u2019oh!\r\nWe once had to use a CS(1) CE version in order to
    access these dictionaries. So this problem is long gone \u2013 great news. \r\n\r\n"
