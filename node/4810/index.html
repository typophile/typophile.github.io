		<div class="commentbody">I agree.  And it is about legibility; oftentimes the only way to distinguish between 0 and O is through the context of seeing them in use with other glyphs from the same set--this can&#39;t be good practice. <BR> <BR>Maybe you should draft a manifesto to the effect that designers &#40;who, ultimately, have the power to change or re-adopt such conventions&#41; reclaim the slash-zero.

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; Clearly the Scandinavian lobby won. <BR> <BR>:-&#62; <BR>I&#39;m a sucker for explicit divergence for legibility, but the slashed zero seems too... brutal. <BR>And yes, potentially confusable with the O-Slash! So maybe a nestled dot is better. <BR> <BR>But then there&#39;s something else: this is a &#34;deliberative&#34; issue, meaning that when there&#39;s potential confusion the reader has all the time he needs to figure out if it&#39;s an Oh or a Zero. So if you diverge the glyphs in more subtle ways &#40;like through height, width, or squareness&#41; you can really solve the problem 95%, without &#34;brutality&#34;. <BR> <BR>A serious problem however is an old-style Zero that&#39;s too much like a lc oh. The usual solution -making it a &#34;perfect&#34; circle- is just pukey to me. So reversing the stroke contrast &#40;which makes sense in the context of the numerals in general&#41;, or giving it weight only on one side, and/or using hybrid nums &#40;taller than x-height&#41; is better, I think. <BR> <BR>&#62; Georgia? <BR> <BR>But the <i>original</i> Georgia nums &#40;hybrids&#41;, not the later -tamed- ones. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good question about the &#34;slash-0&#34;. <BR> <BR>I work at a library and trained myself to start slashing zeros for better legibility with call numbers. Though the dotted 0 does sound nicer. <BR> <BR>The l/1 is still an issue though. And funny  that it was mentioned, as I&#39;ve just gotten back from a trip to Paris &#40;Paris!&#41;, where I noticed the numeral 1 is almost always written as if it were an UC &#34;A&#34; minus the crossbar &#40;and perhaps with a slightly shortened left leg&#41;. It took me a minute to decipher it, but it does seem to make a lot of legibility sense. <BR> <BR>Actually, I was considering a post about just that. How common is the A-without-a-crossbar numeral one, and are there any fonts that use it? <BR> <BR>David Roughs <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Slashing in general is continental - quite often the
"z" has it too, which can actually help it not be a 2.

I don't like the dot style myself, but it might actually
be less bad than the traditional slashed one, which can
be confused for the O-slash (like in Danish). I actually
like the reverse-slash one best.

We all need that, sometimes. Even in print. And even Greeks.  :-)

Yes, Consolas offers dotted 0 and clean 0 as alternative versions of the slashed 0. It also has old-style figures.
Sadly, Visual Studio, the software which most likely being used together with Consolas, doesn't support these Opentype features.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed; computer screens used a slashed zero back when they used a 5 by 7 dot matrix to display monospaced characters using character generator circuitry. Even when a somewhat higher resolution was used on the IBM PC, zeroes were still slashed in DOS.

When they instead wrote characters that looked like type on a graphic screen (such as on the Macintosh, and then on PCs with Microsoft Windows, OS/2, GEM Desktop, or GeoWorks Ensemble) then a slashed zero would not be used.</div>
