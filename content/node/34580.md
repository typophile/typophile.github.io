  pretty good. But in the titles there was an interesting g. I think they picked the
  font for it. It looked like this. Any idea where it comes from?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    -- <a href=\"http://www.aardvarkletterpress.com/index.htm\" target=\"new\">Aardvark
    Letterpress</a> features several sizes of hot metal cuts of Artcraft. In one sample
    the \"g\" ear seems to back towards the right. This might suggest that somewhere
    in point size masters it flips from left to right or vice versa... that would
    really be cool to find out."

    I've got this in my old Barnhart Brothers & Spindler specimen book. I'm pretty
    certain that the \"backwards\" ear was in the original metal. I'll check the series
    when I get home and see if there's any sign of any flipping ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n--

    in 2006. That's how we get it in Alaska in 2007. ;-) \r\n\r\nI expect it was the
    URW/FF digital that was used based on the way the titles looked- Digital texture
    in the font... \r\n\r\nI actually thought it might have been one of Nick Shinn's
    faces when I saw it in the theatre.\r\n\r\nMight Fontesque owe some of it's whimsy
    to this face...? \r\n\r\nAlso the proportions feel very Nick to me somehow. "

  body: "Okay, I had a quick look at my specimens and this thing is a little more
    mysterious than it seemed at first glance. It will take a little more research,
    which I don't have time for right now. \r\n\r\nHere's what I've encountered so
    far. Artcraft is shown in both my BB&S specimen (c. 1925) and my 1923 ATF catalog.
    I can't remember if BB&S had joined ATF by 1923, but it would seem so; and yet
    there's the independent catalog, which I tentatively dated based on some Cooper
    Black evidence. No matter.\r\n\r\nThe BB&S samples do have mixed 'g's in the 10
    point size. But there is no alternate 'g' shown among the displayed auxiliary
    forms. The Bold has one in the 8 pt showing. Not all sizes show examples of a
    'g'.\r\n\r\nOffhand, right now I'm guessing that one of the 'g's is <em>wrong
    font,</em> and probably comes from the related Pencraft series.\r\n\r\nThe ATF
    samples also show a wrong 'g' in the 18 pt size (and no alternate in the character
    set). The Bold also has a wrong 'g' in the 8 pt. *But* the thing is: ATF doesn't
    have Pencraft listed among their offerings. So where do the <em>wrong font</em>
    'g's come from?\r\n\r\nI'll need to spend a little more time sleuthing when I
    get a chance. And I'll get some scans up.\r\n\r\nBut don't hold your breath.\r\n\r\n--

    From all the rummaging around it sounds like some people didn't always have the

    point out that while it's cool to get all the details worked up re: Artcraft -
    \ Stephen did ID my requested sample correctly as the font available at FF.  I
    don't want to stop you, I just wanted to put credit where it's due...\r\n\r\n\r\n"
