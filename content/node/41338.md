body: Sorry if this is a repeat topic. I'm just getting back to a project where I'm
  using Hypatia Sans and I need to know if the italics have been released yet? Thomas,
  any thoughts?

  body: "Dutch buyers beware: Hypatia Sans Pro Italics is HARD to find in the Adobe
    Store. And the full package is 75% more expensive for Europeans (as is usual for
    Adobe): \u20AC 77,35 versus $ 55,00 in the USofA (in todays conversion rate about
    \u20AC 44).\r\n\r\nLink:\r\nhttps://store2.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-NL&event=displayFontPackage&code=1921"

  body: "What Bert said. I found it virtually impossible to get to the Hypatia packages
    in the German Adobe store via the search (no relevant hits) or the menu (constant
    redirects to the US store, even with \u2018Remember my region\u2019 cookies on),
    let alone via the US store\u2019s landing page. The only way was to manually edit
    the URL and replace 'US\u2019 by 'DE\u2019: <a href=\"http://store2.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-DE&event=displayFontPackage&code=1921\">Hypatia
    Sans Italics for Germans</a> \u2013 works likewise with NL, UK, FR etc. The price
    Bert quotes already is with VAT (\u20AC 65 + \u20AC 12.35)."

  body: Adobe store is truly frustrating. I went to the Finnish one (as it won't allow
    me to go anywhere else), but when I finally found the font shop, it won't open.
    Good job it's not an emergency.

  body: "I'm sorry for the difficulties! There are two problems going on with the
    Adobe Type Store.\r\n\r\n1) The North American Store and the other Stores use
    different architecture, so the Hypatia Sans release isn't officially on the other
    Stores yet. That's in process, but I'm not sure how long it will take. (In the
    longer term, the difference in architectures will also be fixed, but that's a
    ways off.)\r\n\r\n2) Something has gone wrong with the keyword search function.
    The web team is investigating. Until it's fixed, the best way to get to the Hypatia
    Sans page is to select the letter H from the alphabetic search tool (right below
    the keyword search tool). The Hypatia Sans packages are the last two listings
    on the H index page.\r\n\r\nI hope this is some help."
