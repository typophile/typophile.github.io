body: Radio and Television are one-way media. You receive what someone else decides
  is important, usually someone with a lot more money that you will ever have. Personally,
  I think they rot your brain and won&#39;t have a television and seldom listen to
  the radio. Text is where people record and share what is important to themselves,
  their families and their communities. When radio and then television arrived on
  the scene, pundits predicted the death of the written word. It hasn&#39;t happened
  and it won&#39;t happen. <i>Verba volant, littera scripta manet.</i> Despite the
  promise/threat of Web TV, the Internet is the most text-intensive medium since Gutenberg
  lined up his pieces of metal and challenged the scribes to keep up.

    let the young tech. jockeys of today ready it for the next &#34;new&#34; thing.
    It is like turning your drawings over to a punch cutter, you get to challenge
    them and speak your mind but they have to do the dirty work of cutting steel.</i>
    <BR> <BR>Actually Chris, not all is lost. I was thinking about this yesterday,
    meaning to ask you what your thoughts are. Remember when we were young and it
    was the philosophy of the day.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t trust anyone over thirty&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>It has taken me many years to find truth to that wisdom. We were right.
    <BR> <BR>Some of these young kids are great, they actually listen and care about
    what you have to say. They are not as much interested in the Bells &amp; Whistles
    of the Radio Tube Generation that keeps creeping up our butts. But they care about
    the arts. <BR> <BR>Or lets call it beauty and the traditional values, there is
    that young fellow in New Zealand for instance. His logo with the &#34;K&#34;.
    Good kid, and that fine &#34;a&#34; fellow from Italy, absolute gold. For me they
    are everything, a chance to pass down values. Chris you should remember that most
    of my life Lithography and Photocomp were well established. I did not participate
    in any of that. I never produced a single job in my entire life by either method.
    I am not a techno-junkie, I leave that to the &#34;Buck Rogers&#34; of the world.
    Especially when it is so clearly inferior, clearly misdirected.  I was not involved
    in hot metal because it was just the technology of the day. I was involved because
    of its clear superiority which is well acknowledged by, for instance, fellow forum
    member, Gerald Lange. He does beautiful work, sent me something, an earlier customer.
    I kept it on my walls for years until it was lost in the tidal wave. <BR> <BR>So
    I am not much interested in the nonsense of technology. I was involved in hot
    metal because I was interested in the book arts. The books arts are going to come
    to pass and some people are going to pretend that new technology is better. Yes
    they will be making plastic women next. They have got to be better. At least for
    those guys. <BR> <BR>They are simply fooling themselves. <BR> <BR>You have probably
    noticed that I have my little fights in this forum. People thinking they know
    more than I. Some of which, by the way, would not even be in this industry had
    it not been for my inspiration. John Hudson for instance. <BR> <BR>I am proud
    of him. Cheeky but &#34;who am I to complain&#34;. <BR> <BR>But if I have any
    qualities I would like to pass down it is by virtue of the arts. That and my forever
    insightful personality quirks. I suspect you haven&#39;t noticed them. <BR> <BR>What
    do boats have to do with typography? I thought your would never ask. For me everything,
    adventure and freedom. To stay in touch with the planets. <BR> <BR>But ask what
    kind of boats do I like?  <BR> <BR>&#34;Wooden boats.&#34;  <BR> <BR>You know
    why, because they are made of wood by human hands with traditions that have gone
    back to early man. I learned something about building wooden boats and it is a
    soul searching experience to learn things that were actually discovered and used
    by forefathers of forefathers that go back thousands of years ago that are just
    as valuable today as they were then. Wooden nails for instance. Trunnels they
    are called. I could tell you a lot about trunnel making itself, about the woods,
    but I want to keep this as a short little note. Wooden boats have evolved from
    simple floating logs to shells, the opposite of cups that keep liquids in, boats
    keep liquid out. Well hopefully

    go ahead and use it for as long as you can. When the operating systems and eventually

    a third-party or open source rasteriser to keep the technology alive, although
    straight conversion of the 8-bit fonts to the OpenType file format would be as
    easy or easier. But take a look at these web pages that test encoding and layout

  body: 'John, <BR> <BR>I am going to look at these links. Also I am thinking about
    this OpenType business once again.  <BR> <BR>Still, I must ask myself what I can
    do for the Chinese, Indian and Arabic computer users? But I am not going to think
    about it long because the answer is obvious. So I am just going along with you
    because you are an old friend and I know you are trying to be helpful.  <BR> <BR>For
    you, OpenType is part of your business. Type making tools, exotic language issues
    is, or so it seems is, part of your business. <BR> <BR>For me it is not, maybe
    Finnish. <BR> <BR>I would have to ask myself how I could be of help to these people,
    what designs can I offer them? What do they know or wish to know about Goudy,
    Bruce Rogers, Caslon. Also I must ask how I am able to make a living from them?
    <BR> <BR>You want to subsidize Lanston John? <BR> <BR>With all the free fonts
    out there, fonts getting spam bundled. Downloads from the net with absolutely
    no business model. Why would people from a foreign exotic language speaking company
    want to buy a font from us, or for that matter you? <BR> <BR>One would presume
    firstly they were going to set something, perhaps in French, English? The usual.
    For the English or French Type 1 fonts are just fine. The exotic speaking language
    countries unless set by some roaming intellectual would not even know what a &#34;ligature&#34;
    was. But if they did, we already have them. Swash, small caps, oldstyle figures,
    etc. Strictly academic folk would need those and those folk are smart enough to
    use Type 1 fonts and have already been using them for years. But most likely if
    those people found a ligature automatically stuck into their text they would have
    to make a service call to find out what was wrong with the font. Who needs the
    agro? <BR> <BR>I am speaking of our alphabet. 99.99% would be unable to distinguish
    between a good European type design from a bad one. For that matter they would
    not be able to distinguish the different sounds of a &#34;b&#34; from an &#34;h&#34;.
    99.99% of them can not speak a word of English. I am sure the literacy rate is
    at least as bad as Prince Edward Island Canada where only one in four can read
    a single word of English or French. I am sure the situation is probably much the
    same in those countries. <BR> <BR>So you say I should design foreign &#34;exotic&#34;
    languages, I must say &#34;no&#34; to that suggestion. Firstly I would find it
    far too arrogant for me to presume to do a better job than their best and my interest
    is in the best. Naturally I am open minded and if William came to me and said
    he designed a Hebrew Alphabet that he thought was good. I would certainly jump
    at the opportunity to address such a matter. I have a great deal of respect for
    his sound observations. <BR> <BR>Mega Corporations, Chinese, Japanese, Indian
    companies that are selling big ticket items hire a good American, English or Canadian
    Advertising companies for print promotional materials in the English speaking
    world. That is how I can help them. That is how I can make a meagre living. That
    market exist for us today. Type 1 fonts I must emphasize. <BR> <BR>Eastern European
    Languages I could be helpful with, once again, there is no logical business model.
    First our designers are unknown. Our promotional materials would have to be translated.
    Our fonts would have to be worked over, new characters and accents added. Then
    some way of getting found on the web would have to be examined. Not to mention
    currency and banking concerns, fraud, piracy but let us not forget the obvious.
    E-mail correspondence. How many different telemarketers, or e-mail personal would
    I require. <BR> <BR>Heeeeelp, I am already drowning.  <BR> <BR>Sorry John this
    does not look like it is going in your favour. <BR> <BR>This is a big world. You
    need, and you sound, like you have resources that I don&#39;t. I predict if you
    removed those resources and competed on  a one on one level with Lanston and followed
    your own advise predictably the next time I visited you we would be meeting in
    Oppenhiemer Park within several months. <BR> <BR>So make sure you get yourself
    a pigeon gun before you do anything so foolish. After all you might not like the
    line ups at the food bank. <BR> <BR>Not to mention, if by some insane fluke profits
    were to be found that were substantial you would be cheated out of your due rewards
    by some bully mega corp that bundles a &#34;copy product&#34; for free with their
    applications.  <BR> <BR>I am curious. What type face do you strongly recommend
    to the typophiles, or the advertising world that was designed by someone in Bombay,
    Iraq or some other place with an exotic language by a designer that &#34;could
    not speak or read a single word of English&#34;? Or any common European Language?
    Please don&#39;t tell me Baskerville was designed by Halima Abdule from Somalia.
    Besides she is still alive and teaches in Roxhill Elementary School in America.
    <BR> <BR>The trick to this question is that the recommendation has to be for a
    book of English literature, such as Shakespeare, or high end advertising print
    promotional material. Such as Rolls Royce. <BR> <BR>Next question: How many fonts
    do you commonly use that has been designed by someone that does not speak any
    European language or any language that uses the Latin alphabet? By someone that
    only speaks their own exotic language and nothing else? Remember William speaks
    English. <BR> <BR>Now I hope your answers to those two questions are similar because
    the questions are. <BR> <BR>But it is possible if the moon can be flat. But not
    likely to win &#34;top TDC awards.  <BR> <BR>Now I am not saying it can&#39;t
    be done, I am just saying I am not going to risk what little I already make in
    this business on plain foolishness. Call me Mr. Conservative. <BR> <BR>Anyway
    let me help you with the answer, Probably not many. How many do you use daily?
    Probably none. How many have you purchased? Well you are a strange one, and you
    have those quirky but interesting typographical pursuits. If anybody does I would
    think it would be you. <BR> <BR>But for the rest of us I am afraid we know names
    like Bodoni, Caslon, Goudy. Not much chow mein shows up in my fonts menu. Although
    I would like to have some soon, I am rather hungry. <BR> <BR>Can I come for dinner
    John? Alright, alright. <BR> <BR>But I will tell you what. If it is that big an
    issue someday I might upgrade my TypeLab software if it has an auto generate OpenType
    format and maybe play around with positioning the ligatures etc.  <BR> <BR>Now
    we have come to some amicably agreement, I have made all the movement, I would
    now ask that you push towards a rational optical scaling for type. I do not mean
    optical sizes. Also to build tools so this is not a lifetime project. <BR> <BR>But
    before you gloat you should know what my reason for considering OpenType. As you
    know I love ornaments, <a href="http://lanstontype.com/DreyfusKeyboardLoft.html"
    target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/DreyfusKeyboardLoft.html</a> and in my
    fine press days I worked for many Jewish, and Iranians customers that came to
    me because of my work. So that is where I believe Lanston has the most to offer
    these people. Ornaments seem to be part of their culture.  <BR> <BR>OpenType maybe
    a good place to put these ornaments to work. Computers are patently inferior in
    ornament handling to hand set type. In fact inferior to setting them on a Monotype.
    Maybe I can find something in that format that would make my time worth the while.
    <BR> <BR>As for the rest of all the 8 bit nonsense I know nothing about and could
    care a less about as long as I can make beautiful and useful things.  <BR> <BR>My
    final complaint about both aeroplanes and computers is the are just too dam slow,
    and I can&#39;t stand waiting for them to &#34;crash&#34;. <BR> <BR>So when you
    speak of bits, you are really scaring me John. When I hear bits, I hear screams,
    I see blood lots of blood and get this sinking feeling. It makes me want to upchuck.
    <BR> <BR>Now finally.  <BR> <BR>How many applications support OpenType? <BR>What
    is the statistics from a minor font company that can indicate the following. <BR>
    <BR>How long does it take to make an OpenType font fully featured? <BR> <BR>How
    much more can one fairly charge for an OpenType font as opposed to a Type 1 font?
    <BR> <BR>In otherwords when I visit should I expect to bring my swimming trunks
    for your swimming pool which was earned by that difference in &#34;direct, end
    user font sales&#34;? <BR> <BR>Or will that not be necessary? <BR> <BR>If OpenType
    offered nothing but ugly fonts and Type 1 offered the fonts you liked. Which would
    you buy for your poetry magazine? <BR> <BR>None of these questions are unreasonable.

  body: 'Gerald, I think you are missing my point. I&#39;m not trying to convince
    you that OpenType is a good thing for <i>you</i> -- although I certainly don&#39;t
    think it is a bad thing, see below --, I&#39;m trying to explain to you why the
    change in font formats is inevitable, because of the short-comings of the Type
    1 format in terms of supporting the scripts and languages and media that are important
    to the people who specify digital font formats. It is irrelevant whether you like
    OpenType or not. <BR> <BR>But some practical information about OpenType for you:
    <BR> <BR>1. OpenType is primarily a font file format -- all the bells and whistles
    of automatic ligature substitution etc. are optional. The font file format is
    a&#41; a single binary file, b&#41; cross-platform compatible, c&#41; Unicode
    encoded, d&#41; in the case of a PS font much smaller than a Type 1 font with
    the same glyph set. So even a straight conversion of existing Type 1 fonts, without
    adding any smart layout features, is an improvement for both font developer and
    customer. The developer only has to manage a single source and a single binary,
    instead of having to make multiple, different Type 1 font binaries for Mac and
    Windows. The customer gets a single, easy to install and manage binary that can
    be used on both Mac and Windows. <BR> <BR>2. <i>How many applications support
    OpenType?</i> <BR>Every application on my system supports the OpenType file format;
    it is, in fact, the most widely supported font format ever. In terms of supporting
    fancy layout features, Adobe and Microsoft are coming at the question from two
    different directions: Adobe apps support layout for rich typographic features
    and Japanese; Microsoft apps support language layout features for complex scripts
    such as Devanagari, Arabic, etc. The two seem set to meet each other and pass
    in the middle, with Adobe adding support for complex scripts &#40;already in the
    Middle East version of InDesign from WinSoft&#41; and Microsoft adding support
    for typographic features. Last year, Microsoft announced system-level support
    for OpenType typographic features for the next version of Windows: this means
    any application will get OpenType Layout support by making standard system text
    output calls. Quark have made semi-public acknowledgement that they are working
    on making Xpress Unicode-savvy as a first step to supporting OpenType; they have
    a long way to go but that&#39;s their own fault not OpenType&#39;s. <BR> <BR>3.
    <i>How long does it take to make an OpenType font fully featured?</i> <BR>If you
    have all the glyphs already -- which you do -- it can be done fairly quickly.
    A small family with standard ligatures, smallcaps, etc. can be done manually in
    a day. Obviously if you have a sizeable library of fonts, you want to automate
    the conversion as much as possible. If I had such a library, I would likely hire
    someone like Adam Twardoch to develop FontLab scripts to merge glyph sets from
    existing Type 1 fonts and build automatic OT Layout feature lookups based on glyph
    names. Fonts with non-standard glyph sets, e.g. something like Goudy Text with
    its alternate caps, would need to be handled manually, but this is still a pretty
    minor job that shouldn&#39;t take more than a few hours. <BR> <BR>4. <i>How much
    more can one fairly charge for an OpenType font as opposed to a Type 1 font? </i>
    <BR>Um, whatever the market can handle? Personally, I charge money for designs
    not font formats. If you significantly expand the glyph set of a font, e.g. by
    adding extra ligatures or other alternate forms that were not in the Type 1 fonts,
    then I think you are justified in charging more. My principal reasons for preferring
    OT fonts are those discussed in No.1 &#40;above&#41;: they are easier to manage
    than Type 1. I have not made a Type 1 font for several years now, and I hope never
    to make one again. <BR> <BR>[&#39;Direct, end user font sales&#39; in any format
    will not be paying for my swimming pool. Making custom fonts for complex scripts
    might just. But I spend most of my income on books.] <BR> <BR>5. <i>If OpenType
    offered nothing but ugly fonts and Type 1 offered the fonts you liked. Which would
    you buy for your poetry magazine? </i> <BR>I would buy the Type 1 fonts and I
    would spend an afternoon converting them to OpenType to make them easier to use.
    Considering how powerful my computer is, I shouldn&#39;t have to think about ligatures:
    they should just happen. I certainly shouldn&#39;t have to butcher the text in
    order to typeset it, changing every occurence of the word &#39;office&#39; to
    &#39;oWce&#39;, for example, in order to get at the ligature in some expert set.
    Of course, Lanston puts their ligatures in the basic character set, but still
    associated with characters that requires changes to the text. I don&#39;t think
    typesetting should be a process of breaking text. <BR> <BR>6. <i>As for the rest
    of all the 8 bit nonsense I know nothing about and could care a less about as
    long as I can make beautiful and useful things.</i> <BR>The key word in that statement,
    as it relates to this discussion, is &#39;useful&#39;. In order to be useful,
    a thing has to be useable. People made beautiful things for the Bobst photosetter

  body: 'Aside: <BR> <BR>[Regarding ornaments, Gerald, as I&#39;ve explained in previous
    discussions, I don&#39;t think there is any particular benefit to using fonts
    as a mechanism for ornament layout. Ornament fonts are something we&#39;ve inherited
    from a time when &#39;output&#39;, i.e. printing, consisted of positioning little
    pieces of metal. What was on the pieces of metal didn&#39;t matter to the press,
    only to the mind of the composer &#40;and in the case of your ornament fugues,
    the double-meaning of &#39;composer&#39; is particularly apt&#41;. A piece of
    metal may have a letter on the end or an ornament, it made no difference to the
    press. But digital type is very different: the computer is not just an output
    device, it is a text input, storage and editing device. Digital typography is
    text-centric in a way that metal type was not: directly manipulating and positioning
    individual sorts is possible on computer, but all our page layout apps and font
    formats are based on setting lines of text. This is why, as I&#39;ve suggested
    before, dedicated ornament setting software that does not rely on font and text
    layout technologies is a better solution.]'

    member who is extremely technically adept wrote me privately and told me your

    <BR> <BR>I put my instincts aside. At that time I had little to no experience
    with graphic files. In fact my experiments with your suggestion is the most graphics
    experience I have. <BR> <BR>All of my work is almost one hundred percent type.
    Always has been. One notable exception was the Mante book. <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/GirlNaturalSetting.html"

    She had been in Japan in the very early 20&#39;s broken her arm and had to cut
    her wood blocks by standing on the block with her foot and cutting the artwork
    with her good hand. Her work, by the way, was outstanding. These blocks had never
    seen ink. The wood looked like it was cut yesterday and they wanted perfectly
    printed proofs of these on hand made paper without any damage other than ink.
    They chose Northland Letterpress <a href="http://lanstontype.com/BuickIvy.html"
    target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/BuickIvy.html</a> for this project. So
    that single job had no type and was strictly woodcuts. They sent the famous Errol
    Ettiene up from Denver who insisted on sleeping in the plant to protect the artwork
    and any copies that may go astray by the local dumpster divers. Of which, by the

  body: 'Gerald, on your website you show some images of pattern development using
    cut out pieces of paper. You might consider that a paradigm for any dedicated
    ornament software. What made that approach useful? How can it be modelled on a
    computer? I&#39;m guessing that the freedom to very quickly manipulate shapes
    -- to flip them, rotate them, move them -- is what makes this approach useful.
    But text layout is all about putting glyphs in lines, and what if you decide that
    you pattern should have one unit rotated 45 degrees <i>in the middle of the line</i>?
    With paper you get out your scissors. With metal you get out your file or your
    furniture. With digital type you have to make a separate story element, and then
    you have to rotate that and try to accurately position it relative to another
    story element. This seems to me very awkward. I&#39;m not surprised that you had
    a hard time using current graphics tools, because they are not ornament-dedicated;
    they have not been designed with pattern-making in mind. <BR> <BR>You say the
    trick is to understand the problems. This is partly true, but one should be aware
    of which problems are particular to technology -- i.e. problems of accurate alignment
    in existing apps, inability to take a virtual file to an ornament -- and which
    problems are fundamental to design with ornaments. I wouldn&#39;t start from the
    problems; I would start from the possibilities. The best, most innovative software
    begins from determining what you would like to be able to do if you had total
    freedom, not from trying to solve problems inherited from other technologies.
    <BR> <BR>What comes to my mind when I think about ornaments -- and I must admit
    to not thinking about them very often -- includes something <i>like</i> a font
    file, i.e. a kind of holder for a collection of ornaments. This could, in fact,
    be a font. But the input and editing mechanisms would be totally divorced from
    the <i>text</i> model of digital typesetting. Actually, it would be much more
    like setting metal ornaments by hand: you would have the digital equivalent of
    a tray of ornaments -- containing one or more collections, which could be purchased
    as sets and also user-defined, making it easy to mix and match from different
    collections -- and you would be able to select elements, drag them into position,
    rotate them, slant or shear them, edit directly to remove or change portions of
    individual elements, and so on. You could set up a grid in the work area, and
    there would also be snap to alignment commands. Parametric pattern making would
    be easy also: you could specify the number of elements, the kinds of rotation
    permitted, etc. and let the software build the pattern. You could assign colour
    to individual elements or discreet sub-elements, or globally assign colour to
    every instance of a particular element in the design. Actually, this suggests
    to me a further refinement, the ability to define classes of elements, so that
    you can control attributes &#40;rotation, colour, etc.&#41; for groups of elements.
    The same element could belong to more than one class, and could be globally adjusted
    in the design in different ways depending on from which class it was selected.
    <BR> <BR>All this is just of the top of my head while sitting here typing. If
    we were in a restaurant, I could draw it on the tablecloth for you.'

  body: John, <BR> <BR>I appreciate your offer to take me to Greece for lunch but
    I must decline. Soon I should get back to Finland. I just thought since I was
    in the neighbourhood we could get together. <BR> <BR>What I was showing earlier
    is that some of the features lacking in PageMaker would share strong use in more
    typical typesetting. Not just ornaments. I would like to sell &#40;for free&#41;
    Adobe on the idea of some incremental improvements. <BR> <BR>The edit  feature,
    for instance &#34;change&#34;. That feature would be best improved. For instance
    it would be nice to be able to change fonts in  a text such as the italics within
    without selecting each individual word or group. If you want to change &#34;just&#34;
    the italics. It would change &#34;just&#34; but all the &#34;italics&#34;, or
    &#34;just the italics in just one size&#34; and if need be, change the colour
    at the same time, or if a word is repeated and needs kerning, your could kern
    once, change all. In otherwords it should have more text editing abilities. Granted
    it does have some word processing stuff going on, but it is not supposed to be
    just for legal secretaries. Also the colour component would have many uses.  <BR>
    <BR>Then a few macros inside the macros and we are about home free. So some independent
    scripts would be nice. In fact rather than have Adobe write the scripts I would
    be just as happy to include recordings with my fonts. If Adobe included a script
    managing tool that allowed independent scripts to be written that would work for
    me, and many others. I know there is some kind of built in scripts but I don&#39;t
    know what they are for, or if you can add to them. It so it certainly is not obvious
    to us old folk. That, and an inspiring little book/manual designed by yours truly

    well serve its &#40;my&#41; customers by having a robust macro recorder built
    into its text editing capabilities. Not to mention my &#34;ulterior motive&#34;
    with ornaments. <BR> <BR>Anyway, were you speaking of this series? <BR> <BR><a

    users. It is no longer being developed as a serious page layout app for professional
    use. In terms of existing apps that are current and in active development, InDesign
    and Illustrator are your best choices for further investigation.

  body: Gerald G.,  <BR> <BR>InDesign&#39;s Find/Change function offers most, if not
    all, of the text editing functions you&#39;re after. It isn&#39;t limited to finding
    word A and replacing it with word B; it can find all instances of Typeface Bold
    and replace them with Typeface Bold Italic, for example. Or find any combination
    of characteristics, including color, size, tracking, alignment, and a host of
    others, and replace them with any other set of characteristics.  <BR> <BR>Very
    powerful, and especially useful when one hasn&#39;t had the foresight to set up
    paragraph and character styles for frequently used settings. <BR> <BR>As a Pagemaker
    user, you&#39;ll find much that is familiar in InDesign. If you&#39;re comfortable
    in Illustrator, even better. And Quark users &#40;like me&#41; usually make the
    switch without too much pain, and often &#40;like me&#41; with great enthusiasm.

    find it a big deal to switch to earlier versions, though importing a design-heavy

  body: Gerald, <BR> <BR>Sorry to hear that you had import problems with your old
    PageMaker files on InDesign 1.5. This has not been a common problem as far as
    I&#39;ve ever heard. I&#39;d be curious to hear more about what Adobe source told
    you that your files were simply uneditable. <BR> <BR>But in any case, that was
    years ago. InDesign is now several versions later, and the PM import stuff has
    been improved more than once. InDesign CS PageMaker edition has further improved
    PM import capabilities &#40;including PM 6.0 files&#41;, and offers the familiar
    PM control bar, among other features. <BR> <BR>Nobody&#39;s forcing you to change,
    of course. But InDesign is the successor to PageMaker, and offers massive improvements
    in typography. OpenType goodies aside, the paragraph composer, optical margin
    alignment &#40;including hanging punctuation&#41; and other refinements make it
    far and away the best option for fine typography on the computer. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    tell you what. If you send me one of your problem files, perhaps along with a
    PDF so I know what it&#39;s supposed to look like, I&#39;ll try converting it
    to ID CS and see if there are any troubles. One time offer, not available in stores.
    <BR> <BR>Oh, and whoever told you that newer versions of InDesign don&#39;t open
    files from older versions was full of hooey. It is, however, the case that older
    versions can&#39;t open the newer files. <BR> <BR>Of course, nobody is forcing
    you to upgrade. You can keep on using PageMaker on whatever OS you&#39;re running,
    and Type 1 fonts. Or use OpenType fonts, you just won&#39;t be able to use the
    extra bells and whistles. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    are severely allergic to stinging insect venom. Each year 90 to 100 deaths from
    sting reactions are reported, but many more deaths may be occurring, mistakenly
    diagnosed as heart attacks, sunstrokes or attributed to other causes. More people
    die each year from the effects of insect venom than from spider or snake bites.
    <BR> <BR>Since perfume, hair spray, hair tonic, suntan lotion, aftershave lotions,
    heavy-scented shampoos, soaps and many other cosmetics attract insects, they should
    be avoided. Avoid shiny buckles and jewelry. Wear a hat and closed shoes &#40;not
    sandals&#41;. Don&#39;t wear bright, colored, loose-fitting clothing, which may
    attract and trap insects. Flowery prints and black especially attract insects.
