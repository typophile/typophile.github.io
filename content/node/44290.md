  Judgment, the first being the logo and the second being the print used for their
  website. http://www.eyeofjudgment.com\r\n\r\nthe font used on their website is common,
  but haven't been able to track down the exact font.\r\n\r\n\r\nsee my most recent
  post for the third font that I could use some help identifying."
