body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm new to this forum and have come here for a purpose. In order
  to provide proper research for a college term paper on typography I am writing,
  I am looking to interview two people who fit the following criteria:\r\n\r\n* You
  possess some form of design study, training, or job experience in the typography
  industry (for example, you design typefaces for a living, you typeset, you have
  gone to a design school in which you learn about these areas, or you have some other
  form of experience).\r\n* You can answer a brief questionnaire which gives insight
  into you and your thoughts on the industry--specifically, on how typography affects
  the world through marketing and other purposes\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to either
  post or email the following details, you will receive the questionnaire on Saturday
  and I will expect a response by Monday at the latest. If you have further questions
  (for I may be a bit vague) either post in this thread or email me directly at 0xbyte@gmail.com\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nDescribe
  what you do relating to this field:\r\nYears of experience with typography (include
  time spent on college courses as well as freelance/foundry positions):\r\nAre you
  available for immediate contact?\r\nHave you held a marketing or management position?\r\n\r\nAgain,
  you may either post or email these questions. If I have selected you for an interview
  you will receive it by Saturday.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCorey"
