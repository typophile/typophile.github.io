  body: It's visually interesting although a bit "noisy" - too much pattern and not
    enough contrast. The underlying HTML code however is not very good from an accessibility
    stand-point - those tables will give screen-readers fits, granted they are not
    your target audience. All that being said, your design work is good.

  body: Thanks for the feedback! Now that you've mention the background pattern is
    a bit too noisy, I'm thinking of lightening the color or maybe just changing it
    too just a color.

  body: I actually redesigned it again today and went with a more simple and minimal
    look. I thought that this was more successful because the previous design was
    kind of distracting for the viewer. This design allows the viewer to be more focus
    on my work.

  body: How large are you images? They load very slowly for me. This isn't print so
    there is no reason to have too much resolution. I'm guessing  you saved them at
    one size but used them at a percentage on your site. Right?

  body: All of my images are only 72DPI. Maybe because I saved them as PNGs, that's
    why they load a bit slow.

  body: 'I like the new look - it definitely helps one focus on your portfolio work.
    But it kind of misses that interesting visual spark your old version exhibited. '
