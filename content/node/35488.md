  body: "When I look at Monotype I don\u2019t see a company worth investing in. Monotype\u2019s
    business model seems to be focused on selling <em>old</em> type, not developing
    <em>new</em> type. I realize that there\u2019s some new stuff coming out of Linotype
    and some of the other foundries Monotype has purchased, but it\u2019s not the
    great stuff coming out of the indie foundries, and the promotion of these new
    typefaces is not nearly as good as Veer or Fontshop. While having thousands of
    old fonts to milk is by no means a bad business model, it is not one that can
    grow enough to justify investing in the company."

    SO MUCH type in their library now it is going to take a lot more than a few email
    blasts to make some noise about the new type. Carl Crossgrove is proof that they
    are interested in creating new type. (To mention only one person.)\r\n\r\nThey
    need a good dusting off. So many people still love the old classics which they
    have, me included, it is unfair to say they aren't worth investing in. "

    consider the coolest, hippest, most cutting edge device to hit the streets in
    years - the iPhone. Reports suggest it includes twelve type families - 11 of which
    are all old-fonts from the Monotype, ITC, Linotype or Microsoft libraries (the
    twelfth is Marker Felt - don't know who did that one). So can you blame any company
    (public or private) from following the money and promoting their existing stuff?

    design that I see from this organization are Lester and Crossgrove and, given
    its size, I wish there were more. \r\n\r\nAnd when I say Monotype Imaging Holdings
    doesn't give a hoot about type design, I am referring to an ownership that wants
    to make money, but doesn't care much about its legacy. I am referring mostly to
    ITC, a collection that is -- as anyone who has followed it in the last 7 years
    would agree -- a sad shadow of its former self. Nothing remarkable has come from
    the library since Monotype acquired them in 2000.  Click \"New Fonts\" at itcfonts.com
    and see a page filled with very few actually new designs (Swank? Baylac?). The
    only genuinely new typefaces I can find in 06-07 are <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2006/Feb2006.htm\">ITC
    Outpost</a>, <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2006/March2006.htm\">ITC

    <a href=\"http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22669.html\">died</a> I started
    to worry about ITC. The day Monotype bought ITC, I said a sad goodbye.\r\n\r\nLinotype,
    on the other hand, has clearly been producing great work with Kobayashi/Frutiger/Zapf.
    And both Mono and Lino are valiantly OpenTypifying their libraries, which consumes
    a lot of resources and isn't recognized by the general public, but is a worthwhile
    effort.\r\n\r\nThere are great people at Monotype who are passionate about type
    and they do fine work: Lester, Crossgrove, [[Allan Haley]], [[Delve Withrington]]
    and their custom type team.\r\n\r\nI just wish the ownership recognized what they
    acquired in ITC and gave it a new life rather than letting it sputter and die.
    They certainly have the money to do great things. Revive <em>U&lc!</em> Rehire

    . . . Those are the things investors look for when determining the financial health

    retail revenue accounts for 40% of the total revenue of Monotype.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I'm not any closer to knowing what really goes on behind closed doors than the
    rest of you, I do know so far the only commentary about this has been from a font

    font releases for retail consumers but the very big business of licensing to big
    corporations . . .</cite>\r\n\r\nRetail consumers are extremely important to the
    corporate license business. Corporations license fonts with great forethought,
    usually by consulting or staff designers. If those designers are not being actively
    targeted by Monotype marketing they end up recommending fonts from other vendors.
    I have no doubt that the intense promotional activities of foundries like House
    Industries, Veer, and Fontshop have a tremendous influence on corporate font licensing.
    This is why I don\u2019t see Monotype\u2019s business model as well-focused on
    growth, at least not enough to justify sinking money into it. \r\n\r\nThis will
    be especially important eight years from now when the elder designers and corporate
    executives of the baby boom are retiring in great numbers. Designers used to those
    classic Linotype faces will be heading off to the beaches, executives who expect
    to see those fonts and dislike newer stuff will do the same, and suddenly a portfolio
    of great twentieth-century typefaces won\u2019t be a great investment."

  body: "Jpad, Keep in mind so long as independent font designers continue distributing
    fonts via Fonts.com, Monotype is expressly allowed to enter OEM licensing agreements
    using these fonts. So I'm not worried that the well of font designs will ever
    run dry for them . . . This holds true for the fonts being added to the Linotype
    Font Explorer store as well . . .\r\n\r\nAlso, it should be noted that most often
    corporate buyers will go first to existing vendors before digging in to find the
    original designer of a typeface so even if its a font Monotype doesn't offer,
    they may be approached first being they are the approved vendor for font purchases.\r\n\r\nNo
    slight to the thoughts being shared by the group or your commentary Steve, my
    comment was focused on how Monotype makes money which is different than how we
    as designers and consumers perceive their income streams.\r\n\r\nIt is eye opening
    to say the least!\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

  body: Once a company reaches a certain size, and particularly if it has shareholders
    and a board of directors rather than being owned by a single person or small group
    of like-minded creative people, the bottom line is the ONLY thing that matters.
    This applies to type foundries, software developers, everybody. You can't expect
    innovation and creativity from large companies except as a coincidental byproduct
    when they're going through one of their "oh, we've got to make a better product"
    phases. Such phases occur only when the big cheeses determine that, for a while,
    a better product will increase profit. Then follows the "resting on our laurels"
    phase.
