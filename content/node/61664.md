body: I'm looking for an alternative to Bodoni poster.  I'm using it mostly at a smaller
  size (around 18 point) and usually as italic. Any suggestions?

  body: I didn't choose bodoni poster... was an existing font in use by the company
    I'm working with. But, was looking for something that has a similar style but
    a bit more readable at smaller sizes.

  body: "Well, if you're after the boldness and high contrast you might want to take
    a look at this <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/didone_extra_bold/\">collection</a>.\r\n\r\nHoefler
    & Frere Jones's <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100004\">Didot</a>
    with optical sizes is also worth a look.\r\n\r\nThere's also <a href=\"http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=11\">Leitura</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=11\">Leitura Display</a> by Dino
    dos Santos. It's not a didone, like Bodoni, but it has a rather high contrast
    and the display cut is very expressive.\r\n\r\nI'm a sucker for <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=SHT0000006\">Bodoni
    Egyptian</a> (predominantly for text), by Nick Shinn, which would pair nicely
    with most other Didones.\r\n"

  body: "Don't know if this is close enough to Poster Bodoni for you (or bold enough),
    but speaking of Nick Shinn, his Scotch Modern has a nice display cut, but also
    a text size and even a \"micro\" cut that seems very readable even at seriously
    small sizes.\r\nhttp://www.shinntype.com/scotch.html (check the PDF)"
