body: "Hi again:\r\n\r\nHere are there three images of fonts that I'm curious about
  but don't know what they are.\r\n\r\nThe first is for TASCHEN. I'm looking the numbers
  '25' in this. \r\nBTW... The other TASCHEN fonts are set in Scala Sans, HF&J Didot,
  and Inserat.\r\n\r\nSecond is the numerals for a book by erberto carboni. Text is
  set in Bauer Bodoni but again its those funky numbers I'm looking for!!!\r\n\r\nLast
  is the Phaidon book \"fashion today\". I thought something by HF&J- but nope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  for all the helps,\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/taschen_25er_flyer_2006_5076.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/25_5311.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fashion2_6720.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fashion3_5606.gif]"

    Clarendon. Its one of those staid classics that when put in the hands of the right
    artist becomes exciting and unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    though. I kinda knew they were hand-done but I was hoping they weren't.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMikey"
