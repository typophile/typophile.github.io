  1910 in Z\xFCrich. Died 1980, also in Z\xFCrich.\r\n\r\nMax Miedinger is known a
  type designer, mainly for his design of the [[Helvetica]] type family (actually,
  [[Haas Grotesk]]). \r\n\r\nIn the late 1920's Miedinger trained as a typesetter,
  and eventually went to work for [[Edouard Hoffmann]] who was the director of the
  [[Haas Typefoundry]]. At the foundry, Miedinger worked primarily as a salesman.
  But in his spare time, at Hoffmann's behest, he designed a sans serif face, [[Haas
  Grotesk]]. Haas partners [[D. Stempel AG]] and [[Linotype]] expanded the design
  into the complete [[Helvetica]] family from 1957 onward. \r\n\r\nHelvetica's sucess
  was huge, and it put him on the map as a type designer. Linotype paid him a stipend
  for his contribution to their corporate success until his death in 1980\u2014a very
  uncommon practice at the time."
