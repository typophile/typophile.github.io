    for a holiday last year and saw it\r\nfor the first time on Phone-booth (beeth?),
    buildings etc\r\nit just doesn't work for me. If you haven't seen it animated\r\nit
    will be hard to get the connection to communication and/or\r\nSwitzerland (ok
    there is half a swiss cross in the icon).\r\n\r\n"

    i like the swisscom logo and i have the same problem, i cannot find a good way
    to make a static logo. But it's just experimental, not a client's job, so i don't
    have to hit my head on the walls to find a solution :)"
