  body: The t is slightly different in the sample, though, and the sample seems to
    be slanted a little more. Could it be a free knockoff of Rage?

  body: That appears to be the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/rage-italic/italic/charmap.html"
    target="_blank"> alternate t</a> in Rage Italic. And artificially <BR>italicizing
    the font gives you, I think, that slant.
