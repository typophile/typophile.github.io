  published by Yale University Press. I can't figure out what it is, but I know what
  it isn't. It is not Helvetica or Helvetica Neue, Akzidenz Grotesk, Galaxie Polaris,
  Akkurat, Dada Grotesk, Digi Grotesk, National, FF Bau or Whitney. Any help would
  be great.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cover_3809.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_6118.jpg]"
