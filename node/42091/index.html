  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Typophiles,

I've recently been commissioned to design an identity for a consortium of tradesmen providing a variety of services including plumbing, heating, solar power and gas fittings for the home.

I'd appreciate it if you would critique my attempts so far, and provide any insights to improvements.

Kind regards,

Paul

		<div class="commentbody">I like the basic concept. Maybe a square so the elements don't look so just thrown together. The t fitting looks a little out of scale with the others. Maybe a drop of water or a wrench. And the bulb with the sun maybe reversed so the sun is dominant. Green, while nice and ecological may be a misleading color for solar. Maybe an orange or yellow. Please forgive my hasty rendering/scribbling.

		<div class="commentbody">Overall it looks nice! I prefer the horizontal composition on the top right. 

I agree with Michael's comments on the icons. However I quite like the existing colours. Since you've got fairly self explanatory pictograms, I wonder if it's okay even if a colour doesn't readily connote the respective idea. 

I'm not sure whether you need the vertical rule between the symbol and the type. Also do you realy need the period marks after the 'I' and the 'L'. I think not.

I think you should adjust the alignment between the name and descriptor visually and not let the software do it. That way the 'P' of the Plumbing would not align to the left edge of the serif of the 'I', but rather to vertical stroke of the 'I'. Similarly, the 'S' in Gas would align to the vertical stroke of the 'Y'.      </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the circles. The pipes is the odd-one-out, though. The other three focus on 'waves/elements' while the plumbing is literally some pipes.

I'd suggest maybe incorporating water/waves into the plumbing icon to tie them all together ab it more. (and I now see that logosam pretty much said the same thing!)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The type treatment feels disconnected from your icons. It’s the sort of conservative serif style that one uses to make an attorney or banker seem older and established. 

The icons themselves are great, but will work a lot better if they don’t abut. Circles are very powerful visual elements, when they form those points inbetween themselves they get too be distracting.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the circles but I also thought someone's suggestion of using squares so the icons would fit together is a good idea. Perhaps uniting the circles like the Olympics logo would be an interesting melding of both concepts. Since it is a consortium of trades, it would make sense to have them linked in some fashion. Then again it might take a simple idea and complicate it -still worth a try. Also play more with the typography, your icons need a more substantial font, what you currently have is too thin and delicate. Simplifying the pipe icon to a water drop or waves is also a good idea. terrific start - keep it going.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On the top left example in the link you provided: No, no, no! Plumbing is below the house and water always finds the lowest place, so the symbol for plumbing should be on the bottom, not the top. The sun is in the sky, solar panels on the roof, and lighting on the ceiling, so that symbol should always be on top.
I recommend that you use an arrangement based upon a hexagonal tiling, with solar on the top, plumbing on the bottom, and heat and gas in the middle.
Beyond a basis in hexagonal tiling, I feel you should follow the surface tension lead even further (hexagonal tiling is the most perimeter efficient arrangement, and so it the most surface-area efficient two dimensional arrangement), and base the shapes on how soap bubbles actually fit together (soap bubbles always for the most efficient arrangement), as seen on the left here:
[[http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v5/n11/images/7400274-f2.jpg]]
Rotating it would form equally valid arrangements (especially by 90 degrees), and I'm only showing this orientation because it is what I could find.</div>
