  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In the early 1970s, in New York City, while I was running a tiny loft-based typesetting company called Intertypographics, I was friends with a black guy, probably gay but I don't know for sure, but geeky/nerdy for sure, in his 20s (which would make him 55 or 60 today), who loved type and typography. Not design or the mechanics of typesetting. Just type and typography. After all these years, I don't remember his name. It's probably more likely that I'd win the lottery, but could he be reading this message?</div>

Actually since there are sadly so few black people in typography (offhand I can only think of three) your chances are probably decent.

George, you could simply point your contact here and let him decide.
