  body: Damn impressive font! I believe this is the most authentic looking handwriting
    font I've seen so far. Beautiful website as well. Just not really feeling the
    logo (the head that is).

  body: Thanks. I was playing around with shields for the logo, but didn't really
    like any of them and it occurred to me that my head is pretty shield shaped so
    I used that.

  body: Haha that's quite a funny thought. I think my problem with it is that I try
    to make it symbolize something but I can't figure out what. Wouldn't just the
    word 'g-type' be more powerful?

  body: "Hi Martin - it symbolises a g inside a head. That's it - nothing profound.
    \r\n\r\nIt had been just the g(type) for over 10 years, but I was bored with that
    so I put it inside the head."

  body: "No Hrant, it doesn't. I put ink blots, spatters, fingerprints and crossings
    out in my previous script Olicana because I made it with a steel nib and ink.
    During the process of writing sheets it occasionally became quite messy, so I
    included that 'mess' in the font.\r\n\r\nRollerscript was far less messy because
    I used a green Pentel pen. I did insert some emoticons, symbols and underlines.
    I suppose I could update with crossings out at a future date if there is a demand
    for it."
