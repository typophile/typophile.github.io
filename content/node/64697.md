body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is my first post here & I know I will get some good
  honest feedbacks.\r\nThis a logo for a technical exhibit that happens in my company
  once every year. Basically the logo is for the theme this year \u2014 iNewvation.\r\n\r\nThe
  idea is to show that new ideas coupled with active efforts lead to innovation.\r\nThe
  logo is not something very hot .. basically trying to show \u201Cout of the box
  thinking\u201D & through some movement in the logo the act of breaking out of the
  box! \r\n\r\nI have some serious doubts about the kerning and the general feel of
  the logo though as I cant say I am very adept at that and it is my first attempt
  at something like this. Would love to hear your comments on this and improve it
  as much as I can ...\r\n\r\nThank you all for the feedbacks already :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TechfairLogo_3691.v1.jpg]"

  body: "Technically, it seems proficient. But stylistically it may have a little
    too much \"boing\" in it. Implied motion is great in a logo like this, but it's
    a little too playful. Add to that, the dot seems out of place on the \"I\". If
    you must have some whoosh, I would consider looking at alternative strategies,
    either with the letters themselves, or around the letters, or as an extension
    of the box. I would take a look at how other designers have achieved this for
    inspiration.\r\n\r\nAnd definitely avoid running the \"WV\" together. As is, it
    could be read as either \"WV\" or \"VW\".\r\n\r\nBut overall this looks crisp,
    feels professional, has breathing room. The box isn't an amazing illustration--its
    white edges might not be ideal--but it conveys the point.\r\n\r\nThe green/yellow
    color might not be the most inviting, but the color coding is definitely a good
    look and adds to the dynamics of the logo."

    I just don't know it helps anything. convey an image, not literally, but with
    class and style.\r\n\r\npeople will have a hard enough time trying to work out
    what the word says (someone clearly thought this was \"genius\") so I suggest
    you keep it waaaay simple.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul</strong>\r\n<a

  body: "Thank you for the feedbacks ... \r\n\r\n@ dirtcastle : The reason I clubbed
    the W and V together was because there was going to be a clear distinction with
    colour (Since only the colour version of the logo will be used -- in banners &
    t shirts), and I wanted the whole up down zig zag thing to create a path of movement
    for the \"whoosh\" .. but yeah, I will definitely try separating them and simplifying
    what the logo is trying to say ... will also try improve the illustration and
    maybe add something to it to give the feeling of movement instead of messing up
    the type.\r\n\r\n@ ratbaggy : I know what you mean if you think it is way to complex.
    I can see the hoch poch going on in the middle of the type too. Any suggestions
    on how can I can avoid that and still depict \"breaking free\"? btw what do you
    mean by \"someone clearly thought this was \u201Cgenius\"? Just asking .. \r\n\r\nThanks
    again for the feedback! Much appreciated :) !"

    imagine that all those letters were in that tiny box. Is the box really needed.\r\nThe
    dot on the I is too static, it\u2019s frozen in that position which ridicules
    the swoosh."

  body: "I'm not a huge fan of the super-smart wordplay either, but the logo concept
    is pretty cool. I'd lose the box though \u2013 too many stories in one logo.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not quite sold on the angles of the springy curve on top of the \"A\". The \"incoming\"
    angle is much flatter (and also looks like it's receding into the distance), so
    the sudden steepness of the \"outgoing\" curve seems unmotivated. \r\nBut maybe
    that's just me.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it seems that the kerning could use some more
    love, especially around \"VAT\"; and you should really finalize that before doing
    much more work on the boingy line on top.\r\n\r\nAlso, type-related: \r\n- I agree
    that it looks too much like the \"W\" and \"V\" are really one letter. I'd try
    moving the \"V\" away, and also making the \"W\" a little narrower, so that it
    doesn't look like it's made of two \"V\"s.\r\n- Have you tried making the middle
    apex of the \"W\" (and the joins of the \"N\") pointy as well, like the bottoms
    of \"V\"/\"W\"? Might give it more sharpness.\r\n- Any reason for the \"A\"s lack
    of a crossbar? FWIW I don't think that's particularly fresh (\"innovative\") anymore
    (not that it needs to be bad \u2013 just asking).\r\n- The tittle on the \"I\"
    needs to be a bit larger. And it's shifted left relative to the boingy curve."

    one step at a time.\r\n\r\nDropped the whoosh and the ball and all those extra
    jazzes altogether for now ... concentrating completely on the typography now &
    here is the result... \r\n\r\nWould love some feedbacks on the kerning. I mean
    it seems fine to me but then again my eyes arent well trained to spot typography
    mistakes really!\r\n\r\nI learnt a lot from this site and all the discussions
    that go on here. Cant thank all of you enough :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FinalTechfairLogo_5020.v2.jpg]"

  body: "The W is a bit thick inside. The first strokes of W and V need to be thicker
    and the first one of A thinner.\r\nIs the N sitting exactly in the middle of I
    and E? Same goes with O between I and N.\r\nV can stand a bit closer to W and
    VAT is stil a bit loose."

  body: I think this may be going too far towards clean and simple. I liked what you
    had going on with the crossbar taken out of the "A" and the W/V overlap, separated
    by tonality.
