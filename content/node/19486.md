body: I'm looking for a font that is military/police/tactical "looking" for an identity,
  I've found a few I like but most go the "M*A*S*H" route or collegiate block style,
  anything else anyone knows of?

  body: What about a grotesque? Somehow I can see <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BureauGrotesque">Bureau
    Grotesque</a> working well here. But for something black and stocky, what about
    <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/champion/index.html">Champion Gothic</a>
    from H&FJ?

  body: "Geoff, those are a little different from where I was headed but thanks for
    the idea, I might just keep in mind Champion Gothic for the future I really like
    it. \r\nssi, now there is a family I hadn't thought of and it's almost perfect
    just still maybe a little cliche, but the client likes that kind of look, I was
    just trying to show they don't have to be obvious with the typeface. \r\nI also
    liked Politica from Storm :http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/typeface.php?id=438"

    at Politics on the Optimo site, though it doesn't have much of a family. Gridnik
    can work well for text.\r\nTim"

  body: Thanks for the help guys, I ended up buying the whole United set from House,
    I actually have been getting more work from these type of companies so hopefully
    this collection will be a good addition.
