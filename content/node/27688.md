  a logo i've been working on for a new online magazine that will focus on streetwear,
  shoes, art, and music. Any feedback or suggstions would be much appreciated. Thanks!
  \r\n\r\nHere are the latest versions i have:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/format501_4705.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/format502_4916.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/format503_4036.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/format601_6732.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/format602_4978.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/format603_3612.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  magazine is called \"Format\". Since the magazine is focusing on cool stuff inside
  & out i thought a logo thats looks the same inside & out would fit well, so as you
  can see it's a mirror image ambigram. "

    with the final look of the logo..\r\nnon of them seems final.\r\nTry aligning
    the horizontal bar of the 'f' and 't\" to the x-height of the other letters, and
    reduce the height of these letters too.\r\nI'm keenly waiting for its final version:)\r\nsatya"

    lower part of \"f\" and \"t\" are more natural\r\n- baseline versions are more
    compact than ones with descenders\r\n- and yes: I'd lower the bars to x-height
    and reduce ascender-height as well\r\n- is the upper swash of the \"t\" in #1
    longer than the swash of the f? It appears to me, but maybe it's an optical illusion\r\n\r\nIf
    everything is done, you may decide whether you still need the \"upstroke\" of
    the \"o\" or if you can sacrifice total consistency to a more natural form of
    this letter (it works with the upstroke as well of course)."

    'a' and 't' for the middle design. Hopefully that'll still look consistent.

  body: I have to agree with Lex. After seeing the changes, I think the original slanted-stems
    of the o/a are better. The latter '0' looks much more like a backwards 'a' while
    the originals were abstract enough that they weren't quite an 'a' or 'o' and seem
    to play off the ambigram better.

  body: The only problem with yours, Satya, is that shearing the f/t at that height
    gives the illusion that the baseline on those two glyphs has been shifted up a
    few points. Plus the straight terminals on the o/a are not cohesive with the rest
    of the rounded terminals.

  body: "I go with shawkash.\r\nIt's one thing to set up a rule and keep strictly
    to it whether it works or not, and another to make small tweaks so the original
    intention works well.\r\n\r\nIt is still readable backwards. it could, actually
    nobody does, but it could... And that's the original intention, not to actually
    read it backwards, but that it *could* be read backwards. It's about the idea,
    not the practical actual action.\r\nTo specify this: It's the same as with Futura:
    the idea of a geometrical typeface ist nice, but when creating it the designer
    comes to the conclusion that things just do not work that way. The trick is to
    make them work with small tweaks, without dropping the idea as a whole.\r\n\r\nI
    would also tweak the horizontal bars a bit, making the left part of the \"f\"
    slightly shorter, the right longer, and the same thing for the \"t\", so the characters
    look more natural.\r\nAnd I would stick with the curved lower part of \"f\" and
    \"t\" (the ones from #1 in the original post). They give the \"t\" it's natural
    form that is distorted by the upper curve at the moment, and do not bother the
    f.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, spacing is not good yet in shawkash's version: \"m\"
    and \"a\" need more space.\r\n\r\n\r\nedit: here is a quick scetch (it still needs
    some finetuning, but the intention should become clear)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/format502_4041.png]"

    stick up as much, and perhaps make the vertical bar shorter for better spacing.
    Maybe make everything just slightly bolder?"

    the rounded versions work so much better in with the ambigram concept while retaining
    the legibility component, there is something about the white space between the
    fo and at pairs where the two curves have different radii, you could look at kerning
    the or and ma pairs out to take into account the large open counters of the rm.
    Your last post with the semi-rounded terminals might work better if you lower
    the crossbars a touch and change the kerning as above.\r\nTim"
