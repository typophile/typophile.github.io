<div class=commentbody>Is this on a playground sign? I was not here for the original critique. How do the top two .org's fit in? <br> <br>I like the middle right decal. You could put the child from the bottom right in the middle right version. <br> <br>I prefer the dark green in the decal. <br> <br>Too many kids on the letters. Can you pick one or two letters? It is a lot to look at. The trees are also distracting. I would limit their use also. <br> <br>The renderings are jagged. I'd output them better. <br> <br> <br>Andrew <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>i was not here for the original posting either, so i am not quite sure what this is for, etc. <br> <br>I agree with Andrew's comments. In my opinnion, the middle one on the right is the only one that is a strong mark. The other ones need a lot of simplification and in general look unprofessional.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If it's to solicit money, I think perhaps you need something a bit more formal/refined. A more abstract mark. Then back up the mark with plenty of photos of happy children in the rest of the marketing materials.</div>

<div class=commentbody>i don't know if formal is the right word -- professional and refined might be a better way to explain the direction you should take. for example, <a href=http://www.thechildrenshospital.org/index.cfm target=_blank>http://www.thechildrenshospital.org/index.cfm</a> . . . The Children's Hospital logo is playful, yet professional.</div>

<div class=commentbody>What I would guess Darrel is alluding to, is that you are not trying to attract children (playful), you are trying to appeal to financial contributors (formal/professional). Whenever I contribute money to a cause (other than buying candybars from my neighbors children), I need to feel confident that the money is going to an organization that knows money and how to use it. This almost calls for a banklike look. <br> <br>Represent children/playgrounds, yes, but the purpose of this mark seems to be to promote contribution. Consider stability, professionalism, generocity and community first, then take a stab at the children/playgrounds. <br> <br>Technically, these marks look like very rough computer generated illustrations. Is that intentional? It doesn't seem appropriate IMO. <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott</div>

<div class=commentbody>For starters, the success of a business is not a derivative of a great logo. I have seen many businesses with excellent visual identities fail; likewise, I have seen businesses with substandard identities succeed. Frankly, I highly doubt that Kaboom's logo is what has driven their success, it looks to me like a mediocre concept that is poorly executed. The tag line, however, is excellent, which leads me to believe that there might be some very talented marketing heads behind this success. <br> <br>Having said everything I've said, I have never had a project like this, thus, I've never done sufficient research; therefore, I may be speaking completely out of ignorance to how these foundations run. <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well Kaboom is a sound and a visual explosion. <br> <br>I dont really like their logo personally. It's very generic. But kids could care less about the formal aspects of logos. <br> <br>I think it all depends on your audience, which I know nothing of. I was critiquing your logo on ways to improve it really. It's in a roughstage right now i think. <br> <br> <br> <br>Andrew</div>

<div class=commentbody>"Formal/refined...for a playground? Yes, one of the primary uses will be to solicit funds, but how do you make the leap to formal?" <br> <br>Because you're asking for money. The first marks appeared to be targetted at kids. I assume you're asking money from adults. Perhaps 'formal' was the wrong term...maybe more 'adult' is what I'm going for. <br> <br>It can still be (and probably should be) fun, but it shouldn't be childish. <br> <br>Now that I've read the rest of the threads, I see others have said that better than I had. ;o) <br> <br>" Why does their logo work so well?" <br> <br>I don't think it does. It's fairly generic. The name is interesting, but, again, kind of vague. A good logo isn't always necessary if they have a good product, of course. <br> <br>Anyways, think 'fundraiser' more than 'playground'. It's first and foremost a fundraiser FOR a playground. <br> <br>"What about the simplicity here: " <br> <br>That's better, but still much more of an illustration than a logo. You need to distill that down much more. Consider sun, slide, flower. Try and combine those in more abstract/simplified forms. <br> <br>Also, you don't need to use kids handwriting. Too obvious. ;o) <br> <br>Finally, consider concepts like 'growth', 'nurture', 'empower', etc. <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow! Where did that come from? This is quite a shift in direction. <br> <br>Aesthetically, I would suggest starting with removing all of the boxes and borders</div>

<div class=commentbody>"'Consider stability, professionalism, generocity and community first, then take a stab at the children/playgrounds. ' <br> <br>This is the first consideration" <br> <br>Terrific first consideration. It now looks like you are trying to solicit corporate sponsorship rather than just get all the parents to donate a few bucks here and there. I'm wondering, will this logo just be used for the fundraising aspect of the project, or will it also carry on -perhaps as signage on the finished playground? If the later, I'd like to see you incorporate some for the playfulness of your earlier designs with this recent go-a-round. Maybe it's something as simple as the fern looking like it was drawn by a child using finger paints. Or maybe instead of a fern the icon could be a swing (or other such item) What is most important for this project "Fernbank" or "playground"? <br>Good work, keep going.</div>
