    you, instead of the work.\r\nI already know about you, I want to read about the\r\nwork.
    But it looks pretty! "

  body: "I kinda like the site, but, I noticed this as well.: All your type is image..
    <em>( The site may not be easily spidered and indexed by search engines, because
    there basically is no 'readable' HTML text, at all.. You should really think about
    putting at least some of the descriptions and texts in plain HTML, instead of
    images.. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav, <a href=\"http://www.formlos.net\" target=\"_blank\">formlos</a>"

  body: "I dont think the type is to grey, but I do think you need a little more space
    within the whole layout (a bit of breathing space)\r\nOn the techincal side it
    seems a little sluggish, Flash would be more efficient than your use of Javascript"

  body: "It's a very hard site to use. The javascript is sluggish and the page is
    too tall for my browser. So, I have to scroll down, click something, then scroll
    back up to see it.\r\n\r\nAlso, the mystery-meat navigation is a bit arcane (but
    oh so typical on portfolio sites ;o) \r\n\r\nAlso, some of the mystery meat bars
    are links and some aren't. Confusing.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest not using javascript,
    and make it a nice static site, or consider the flash option. But do put the navigation
    next to the actual images.\r\n\r\nBTW, very nice portfolio pieces!"

  body: "I like that the site seems to be secondary to the work, which should be the
    focus of a portfolio site. The colors of your work really pop. Too many sites
    get in the way, visually.\r\n\r\nBut, as others have noted, the navigation is
    a bit obtuse at first, and those first seconds of \"now what do I do?\" are so
    crucial. The striped image area could have your bio inside of it, since that's
    the focus at first, then you can move the portfolio navigation up closer to the
    images. You should probably differentiate between active and inactive items in
    the rectangle nav. Right now it looks like you designed a navigation that doesn't
    fit your content. Perhaps an outlined box?\r\n\r\nThen, I'd punch the heads up
    a bit. All of the type is a bit broken and light on my monitor (PowerBook 17\"),
    so the heads should get a bit more weight/darkness to allow quicker comprehension
    of the site's structure.\r\n\r\nNice work, by the way."

  body: Upon a second look, I think you should seriously reconsider such light type.
    It's really hard to read on my monitor, and this is a very common model for designers.

  body: "Cheers for the comments all round. Noted the 'bleached out text' problem
    that is more evident on laptops and will work on actual text as opposed to png's
    of text. This is the first live website that I've tackled so I'm hoping to learn
    from mistakes as early as possible! Pleased that the work - as opposed to the
    website design - comes to the foreground.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\ns"

  body: I kept losing my place when I was swapping between the comments page and the
    site. Why are you passionate about typography? Even though we have broadband,
    I would still have preferred the option to browse through your work more, not
    download a mov or pdf. Perhaps that could be a vehicle for showing why you love
    design so much.
