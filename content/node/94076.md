  have a Cyrillic /El/ looking like a Greek /Lambda/ as your standard glyph?\r\n\r\nIs
  it in any way unacceptable? \r\n\r\nOr is it just a localised form?\r\n\r\nI guess
  the same question applies to /De/ and /Lje/ too.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi, some may say it is a localized form. I personally think that it is actually
    the more appropriate form for those letters. Some may state that this is more
    Bulgarian or Ukrainian look for those letters.\r\n\r\nI think it depends on the
    overall style of the typeface, and the market you are willing to sell it to.  No
    offense to anyone, but i have heard that Russians actually do not like this way
    of interpreting \u041B, \u0414 ...so it is up to you.. \r\n\r\nBTW look here https://www.facebook.com/cyrillictype
    . \r\nOn this facebook page we have posted many cyrillic type specimens, to serve
    as inspirations in such moments. May be you will find your answer there. \r\n\r\nPS:
    I am actually Bulgarian, and prefer the triangular Cyrillic forms (Lambda based)
    - i find them adding more dynamic look to the typeface..."

  body: "It depends entirely on the style of the typeface. There are established idioms
    of Cyrillic type design, just as there are of Latin type design, so unless you're
    coming up with some novel style you need to research the idioms carefully and
    understand what is appropriate to each. The shape of the \u0414 and \u041B is
    one of the most characteristic features of most idioms. The triangular form is
    most often found in styles based on broad-nib pen constructions influenced by
    the style of renaissance Latin types, e.g. Lazurski.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't
    favour the triangular form, even in my types based on broad-nib styles, and think
    it works best in all-caps display types, not text."

  body: "Thanks, John. \r\n\r\nYou don't go into geographical preferences, but rather
    base the choices one should make on typographic idioms. There are however a number
    of well-known foundries who will offer alternates based on let's say, a Bulgarian,
    Serbian, Macedonian or Ukrainian preference. What I am finding difficult is plot
    a course through (a) what looks right for internal fit/consistency (with Latin
    and Greek too), (b) what is idiomatically/stylistically acceptable (which is subtly
    different from (a)), (c) what helps legibility/readability (almost impossible
    to gauge as a non-Russian/Cyrillic reader), and (d) what is generally preferred
    by (or at least more familiar to) the majority of Cyrillic end-users.\r\n\r\nI'll
    stick with just Latin next time and not risk looking a fool!"

  body: 'I don''t believe this distinction is freighted with quite so much significance
    as some would have. Compare with alternate forms of /g in Latin: if the face is
    a revival or pointedly idiomatic, then one has to be "proper" (if one wants to
    control the degree of conformity), but for an original design, it sets its own
    standard.'

  body: "In the present-day Cyrillic typography there exist three main construction
    patterns of the upper- and lower-case \u0414:\r\n\r\n(<em>a</em>)\u2003The delta-like,
    isosceles; it is often used in Old-Style serifs, in Geometric and Humanist sans-serifs
    (e.g., in <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Lazurski.htm\">Lazurski</a>,
    <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/ITC-Kabel.htm\">ITC Kabel</a> and <a
    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/hypatia/hypatia.html\">Hypatia</a>),
    and also in type designs inspired by Roman monumental lettering (e.g., <a href=\"http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1952\">Trajan
    Pro 3</a>, <a href=\"http://castletype.com/html/tipoteca/goudy-trajan-regular.html\">Goudy
    Trajan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.malgil.com/esl/SPQR-Caps-1p.pdf\">SPQR</a>);\r\n\r\n(<em>b</em>)\u2003The
    right-triangular, lateen-like: it is typical of the 18th\u2013early 19th century
    Moderns (Didot, Bodoni, etc.), and has the similar historical flavour (e.g., in
    <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/ITC-Bodoni-72.htm\">ITC Bodoni</a>,
    <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Elizabeth.htm\">Elizabeth</a> and <a
    href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/ITC-Machine.htm\">ITC Machine</a>); this
    pattern is occasionally used in other designs, with no connotation to style Empire;
    and \r\n\r\n(<em>c</em>)\u2003The trapezoid; it is much more appropriate for Modern
    and Grotesque sans-serifs (e.g., in <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Bodoni.htm\">Bodoni</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/48344/HelveticaWorld-family.html\">Helvetica
    World</a>); this pattern is also typical for the late 19th-century \u2018Old-Face\u2019
    romans designed in the eclectic Beaux-Arts style, e.g., <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Literaturnaya.htm\">Literaturnaya</a>,
    n\xE9e Lateinisch (Berthold, 1901).\r\n\r\nIn (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>) the
    ascending diagonal is drawn either straight, or sagging, or\u2014occasionally\u2014slightly
    bowed.\r\n\r\nThe form of the \u0414 and \u0434 is usually co\xF6rdinated with
    the \u041B, \u043B, \u0409, and \u0459, e.g., in <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Maiola\">Maiola</a>,
    <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Standard-Poster.htm\">Standard Poster</a>,
    or <a href=\"http://typography.net/fontfamilies/view/28\">Bliss Pro</a> (this
    is the general rule, and there are many exceptions, like <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Academy.htm\">Academy</a>,
    <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Kis.htm\">Kis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/candara-family.aspx\">Candara</a>).\r\n\r\nThe
    trapezium-based pattern of the sans-serif \u0414 with the top left corner rounded\u2014e.g.,
    in <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/ITC-Benguiat-Gothic.htm\">ITC Benguiat
    Gothic</a>, <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Sistemnyi.htm\">Sistemnyi</a>,
    or in <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/ITC-Anna.htm\">ITC Anna</a>\u2014is
    well familiar to the users of Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nThe Latin form (D) is used in most
    Cyrillic script typefaces, inspired by both handwriting and calligraphy (but not
    in italics), e.g., <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Kapelka.htm\">Kapelka</a>,
    <a href=\"http://paratype.com/pstore/fonts/English-157.htm\">English 157</a>,

    The real question is, what do you mean by \u2018contemporary\u2019? Is that a
    Geometric, or a Humanist sans? A Grotesque or a Neo-grotesque, etc. There are
    no hard and fast rules for glyph construction of \u2018<strong>a Cyrillic</strong>\u2019
    typeface\u2014nor are there any for \u2018<strong>a Latin</strong>\u2019 typeface,
