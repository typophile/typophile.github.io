  well as coloured underlines. Does anyone have any experience doing similar things?
  What colours did you pick? I'm after whats working well with lot's of whitespace.
  \r\n\r\nMy initial idea was using magenta, since it's both contrasting and readable
  against white paper. Also, I might need to use a laser printer - and any other colours
  besides C, M, Y & K will output a lower resolution. (Am I right?)\r\n\r\nI'm lusting
  for a bright red."

  body: "A big question is whether it's a PostScript laser printer or not. (For this
    purpose, even third-party PostScript emulations are fine.)\r\n\r\nIf it's not
    a PostScript laser printer, or you use a PS compatible laser in a non-PS mode
    such as PCL, whatever you do will get sent as RGB data by the printer driver and
    converted to CMYK at the printer end. It's impossible to get really nice solid
    colored text in this case. Sorry.\r\n\r\nIf it IS a PS laser, you need to be using
    a PS driver, and an application that allows you to set your colors as CMYK colors,
    and to turn off color management for your CMYK color space. Then you can specify
    solid CMYK colors. For example, a nice bright red might be 100C-100M-0Y-0K. As
    long as the printer's registration is okay, that would print out pretty well.\r\n\r\nBeing
    an Adobe guy, I know how to do all this in InDesign, but not QuarkXPress. Last
    time I looked, Word's internal color model was strictly RGB. What application
    are you using?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm using Adobe InDesign & Illustrator. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not really
    sure regarding the printer being a Postscript laser or not. Could you explain
    the difference? I know I can specify CMYK colours, and even set the percentage
    of each colour manually when printing. It's a Minolta printer. (I can get the
    model name, if needed.)\r\n\r\nI've been told mixing inks would give a \"halftone
    image\" of the text \u2013 and thus a lower resolution."

  body: "Thomas is spot-on about keeping the colours \"pure\" and if you can, that's
    certainly the way to go. I've also had good luck with  reproducing colours with
    one (and even two, depending on what sort of percentages you end up with) of C,
    M, or Y, plus K, which at least gives you a little more flexibility.\r\n\r\nI
    can't find the file right now, but I did a project a number of years ago that
    used a nice teal with a rich brown that worked out very well. Getting one of the
    fans that translates Pantone colours into CMYK would also be very useful as a
    starting point."

  body: "Your best bet for color reproduction on a laser is to get a Pantone CMYK
    palette, find a color you like, and print a sample of the nearest ten colors to
    see if you can find something that matches it. Some colors look great on a laser
    and some look dreadful\u2014it\u2019s really just a trial and error thing. I have
    a KonicaMinolta laser printer and the color is pretty terrible overall; when I
    want good laser color I use a Docutech system or just have it run off at a local
    print shop that keeps their high-end Xante machines in tip-top shape."

  body: A pure red looks good even if the registration is not so great, because any
    exposed yellow is practically invisible. This also lets you use lower percentages
    of yellow if you wish; as long as your magenta stays at 100, it won't look screened.

  body: Good practice in a high-volume color copy shop dictates that the machines
    be calibrated every morning for color accuracy and registration, so the earlier
    in the day a job runs, the better it stands a chance of being as perfect as the
    copier is capable of achieving. Ambient humidity plays a factor, too; on very
    damp days, high-speed copiers tend to jam more often, which can screw up the calibration.
    On the other hand, if the air is too dry, there's a problem with jams caused by
    static build-up, so--during cold weather--earlier in the day is better, too...
