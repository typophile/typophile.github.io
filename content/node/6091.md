body: Here is Origen <BR> <BR>Is my first attempt to make a font for text. <BR>As
  you can see it has rescue some elements of a serif type {like the contrast} in order
  to make it more legible. <BR> <BR>Origen is the develop of a type designed for me
  ina a Logo with the same name {posted here like two months ago}. The result ends
  in a total different thing, in order to increase it&#39;s legibility at samll sizes,
  but i think the spirit remains. The curve extreme ends, started as a way of keeping
  a relationship with the logo I develop, but in the end it rises like a good way
  to give this font a unique personality. <BR> <BR>In order to make the final version,
  i am gathering all yhe critics, and then i will put my self into work. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for the feedback <BR> <BR>CG <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4287.jpg"

    that&#39;s a very good thing&#41;. <BR> <BR>Some of the contrast needs work &#40;like
    in the &#34;M&#34;&#41;, and I&#39;d shorten the descenders a bit, but otherwise
    it looks pretty close to release. Assuming you&#39;ve finished the spacing, and
    done the other 100 non-alphanumerics...  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Looks great. I like how the second foot of the <b>h</b> and <b>n</b> drop
    below the baseline. <BR> <BR>The lowercase <b>s</b> needs contrast work. Compare
    it to the lowercase <b>r</b>. The width of the stroke in <b>s</b> appears to be
    nearly constant while the stem and terminal of the <b>r</b> are heavy compared
    to the thin arm.

  body: 'Just a general thing: I don&#39;t know if you designed the forms in pencil
    or directly in some application on your computer, but my experience has made me
    realize that often is helpful to create some &#34;on-the-fly&#34; grids. <BR>I
    mean that a precise grid goes against the casual feeling you wish to convey, but
    no grid at all could make you confused, expecially when you have designed all
    the letters, like in Origen. <BR>Of course it&#39;s not an easy thing to do. I&#39;m
    still trying to apply it in my own faces, too. <BR>A &#34;grid&#34; may just mean
    also using parts of letters you have already designed that are satisfying and
    armonic as a basis for the others.  <BR>'

  body: Making traps look good is an interesting challenge. Certain designs lend themselves
    to the process better than others. For example, the [currently re-emerging] Eastern
    European &#34;fauve&#34; style looks great with abrupt traps &#40;with or without
    cavity shears&#41;, while in highly organic designs what might be called &#34;cleavage&#34;
    traps &#40;with no cavity shearing&#41; blend in great. In the cooler geometric
    designs &#40;like Futura&#41; it&#39;s hard to make traps look good. <BR> <BR>hhp

    <BR>This is a really elegant design, with a great level of detailing. Nice traps
    too! My only serious concern is its color: especially if your target is small
    text, it&#39;s way too light. Of course that helps make it elegant, so I hope
    you have a wide weight range planned. <BR> <BR>The spacing needs work, and I think
    it&#39;s slightly loose &#40;even for that light color&#41;. <BR> <BR>The lc is
    great - that &#34;g&#34; is killer. Some specifics in the UC: The &#34;G&#34;,
    &#34;K&#34; and &#34;U&#34; seem narrow; the &#34;S&#34; is wide; I&#39;d make
    the &#34;J&#34; descend. <BR> <BR>Numerals: very nice. Just the 7 and especially
    the 8 look narrow. <BR> <BR>I think the &#34;ae&#34; should have a joined middle
    bar, and in the &#34;oe&#34; the &#34;o&#34; is a &#34;c&#34;. There&#39;s something
    wrong in the eszet, but I&#39;m not German enough to give you good advice on that.
    In the &#34;ck&#34;, raise the left side of the join. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the
    logic behind the sizing of the currencies, like the Yen, Pound, and Cent? <BR>
    <BR>I think the Asterisk looks great at large sizes, but for smaller sizes &#40;your
    target?&#41; it&#39;s too busy. <BR> <BR>The TM needs to be darker. <BR> <BR>--
    <BR> <BR>This is a wonderfully promising design, and I expect to see it used a
    lot once it&#39;s released! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    Very nice. The italic you show looks a little dark for the roman &#40;like semibold
    italic&#41;. <BR> <BR>The one thing that really bothers me is the strange structure
    of the M and N in all weights and variants. I really noticed it in your small
    cap M. Traditional would have an M = | thin, \ thick, / thin, | thick and and
    N = | thin, \ thick, | thin. I would stongly encourage you follow tradition on
    this one. Some people will say don&#39;t worry about it, but since the rest of
    the font is so well crafted, this divergence really breaks the rythm. <BR> <BR>Please
    do a Black version! &#40;salivates&#41; <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy
