body: "I am trying to figure out a way to render typography into a 3D plane. I am
  able to do it in photoshop by rasterizing the text and then transforming its perspective.
  I have also tried it in Illustrator using the 3D effect. I am not completely happy
  with my results yet. I would prefer to take a text frame and put it into perspective
  and then have the ability to edit the copy.\r\n\r\nHas anyone had any great luck
  at this? Should I try 3D software.... if so which one?\r\n\r\nbest,\r\njosh"

  body: Where you are setting the type on a flat plane, 3d software won't give you
    much advantage over Photoshop or Illustrator. You can really achieve any perspective
    you want with a non-affine transformation (where you can drag the corners of the
    transform box independently).

  body: If you are interested in more complicated effects, 3d apps will get you there,
    but there is a pretty big learning curve, and an even steeper price curve. A good
    place to start for price/features is the open source 3d app Blender [ http://blender.org
    ], but it will take a while to figure out the interface.
