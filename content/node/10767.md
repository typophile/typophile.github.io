  body: Made me think of John Downer&#39;s <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10479924631107250&amp;fontname=Ironmonger"
    target="_blank"> Ironmonger</a> Extra Condensed. It&#39;s not a literal match,
    but it has exactly the same feel and spirit to it. <BR> <BR><i><b>Ironmonger</b>
    was inspired by lettering painted on masonry walls and fascia signs of warehouses
    and factories in older American cities. The slab serif capitals and figures are
    made up of precisely plotted and carefully digitized angles, no curves. Ironmonger&#39;s
    terse construction provides a constrained rigidity much favored by <b>John Downer</b>,
    son of a hardware merchant. Five contrasting designs create a complementary set.</i>
