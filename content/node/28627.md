  body: "Faz,\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by Tiffany, the Triumvirate of books is a good beginning.
    \ You might also consider telling everyone what aspects of typography interest
    you most. Type design? History of letterforms? Proper usage of type? Technical
    development?, etc. We may be able to then suggest some books which are directed
    to your specific interest.  At any rate, Welcome to Typophile!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Any book that covers too large a span of time is more than likely to not give
    you the depth you really need. I'd avoid books like that if what you are hoping
    for is any amount of depth.

  body: "Faz,\r\n\r\nThe only difference is that the 1999 version is paperback--and
    perhaps therefore a bit cheaper :-)   I have the paperback version.  I am sure
    either is fine.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 version may have some minor update but probably
    not a big change.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: To answer Tiffany's concern about depth,
    the back of the book contains a suggested reading list to give you more depth
    if you get hooked on the subject (as many of us here are). I thought you were
    looking for an overview to get you started.  There are thousands of years of material
    to cover."

  body: 'Always keep your eyes open at used book stores: good books on type/typography
    are''t exactly big sellers or frequent finds, so often they''re insanely expensive,
    but I found my used copy of <em>The Form of the Book</em> (and in excelent condition)
    for $10. As for the original query, early on I found Chappell/Bringhurst''s <em>A
    Short History of the Printed Word</em> quite educational (like <em>The Form of
    the Book</em>, also published by Hartley & Marks).'

    of Typographic Style, Robert Bringhurst (3rd Ed.)\r\nLetters of Credit, Walter
    Tracy.\r\nAnatomy of a Typeface, Alexander Lawson\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\nShort History
    of the Printed Word, Chappell & BRINGHURST (Rev ed.) - brilliant intro' to the

    Timothy Samara (2003) \u2013 good intro' to grids\r\nType & Typography, Andrew
    Haslam & Phil Baines - well rounded book with invaluable glossaries. \r\n\r\nI
    have more suggestions \u2013 just shout if you'd like them. \r\nBut, if I had

    the same case.. I need an article on typography for a class reading, any suggestions?
    The only thing- the author must be a practitioner of typography/ type design/
    communication design!\r\nThe elements of typographic style (Robert Bringhurst)
    virtually being the bible for us all, is something I'm trying to avoid, since
    a number of students in my class would have picked up the same book!\r\n\r\nHelp! "
