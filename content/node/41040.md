body: "So I want to edit some CS2 indesign files, but I only have CS3. All I'm editing
  is the copy. I read that I can export the file as an interchange but I read on some
  other forum not to do this because it will mess up the file when I bring it back
  into CS2. (which is all i have at work, but I have 3 at home) The adobe website
  just said to make sure that 2 is up to date before these files are opened. What
  do you guys think? Is this a bad idea to try? Is there another way to back save
  to CS2 from 3?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    working with multi-page, multi-column documents containing images and tabular
    data.

  body: "I actually learned that saving as an interchange file is good to do every
    once in a while especially if you are using old or previous jobs as pick-ups.
    In the environment I work in, we are using jobs for years at a time, and almost
    all jobs are picked up, and saved as. This can cause a ballooning effect in file
    size after a while. If you save as an interchange file, it strips it down to code
    essentially and is then build or put back together so to speak when you open it.
    \r\n\r\nI'd say you are pretty safe saving as interchange and opening in CS2.
    I do it all the time and notice no difference."
