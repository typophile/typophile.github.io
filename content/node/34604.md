  body: The new Gerrit Rietveld Magazine uses Adobe Garamond. Come and get it at the
    opening this wednesday-sunday in Amsterdam. If you can't make it, then it's usually
    available from http://www.nijhoflee.nl/ in the time after the show.

  body: You didn't ask about books, but I seem to recall reading here that the US
    editions of the Harry Potter books are set in Adobe Garamond. I wonder what typeface
    the UK editions use.
