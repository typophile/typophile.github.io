  the x-height of text in stead of the baseline, I am sure that we all do it intuitively,

  are there plug-ins available?\r\n\r\nCheers, \u2013RTFRT\u2013"

  body: "It's not much work to set this up manually. On the master page I put guidelines
    on every baseline, make a copy and shift them to the x-height. I put this on a
    separate layer so I can turn it on and off whenever I want. Takes less than a
    minute.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

  body: If you set your text frame options to have the first baseline aligned by x-height,
    and snap text frames to the document grid, it's simply a matter of matching the
    increments of the  document grid to your leading.

  body: "This could be easily build in. The value for the x-height is in the font
    data, along with the values for the caps height, ascender height and descender
    length. \r\n\r\ntable OS/2 {\r\n\tTypoAscender xxx;\r\n\tTypoDescender -xxx;\r\n\tPanose\t
    x x x x x x x x x x;\r\n\tXHeight xxx;\r\n\tCapHeight xxx;\r\n\tFSType x;\r\n}
    OS/2;\r\n\r\nI see lots of other interesting possibilities. When paring or comparing
    different fonts, one could have their x-heights aligned, i.e. scale them so that
    their respective x-heights fit a given absolute value, e.g. 10 pts. One would
    also have the option to do the same for the caps heights, descenders/ascenders.\r\n\r\nThis
    feature would allow for at least a better standard for font sizes. As we know,
    the point size (corps) tells nothing about the perceived optical size of a font.
    Design briefings that state a required point size, but allow to choose a typeface
    at wish, are inadequate. A prerequired absolute x-height value would be better
    instead.\r\n\r\nI suggest to at least implement a x-height box into the type panel,
    next to the size box: if one changes either of the values, the other is recalculated,
    so that one could see immediately what absolute size equals the x-height of a
    certain value. If caps, ascender/descender height could be implemented this would
    be nice too."
