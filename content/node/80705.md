body: "I recently created some OT/ttf fonts for an online greeting card company and
  am now doing a few fixes. The fonts were originally old proprietary PS fonts. Most
  of the fixes were just resetting vertical metrics. \r\n\r\nThe odd one in the bunch
  was substituting r and s with start_of_line versions. The text read: this and farrow.
  The s and two r's had beginning swashes and the s intruded into the space character
  making it look like thi sand. I cannot duplicate this on my computer. What's odd
  is I think the app they use for these doesn't have the capabilities for OT substitutions
  anyway. The three words in the sample would have had 2 ligatures if OT was functional.\r\n\r\nAre
  there other issues that can cause this type of Behavior? Maybe a cache version they
  didn't see?\r\n\r\nStephen Rapp"
