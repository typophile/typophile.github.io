body: "It suddenly stuck me one day that English typefaces are so much all over the
  planet that we at time neglect the (little) lesser yet beautiful ones. In fact,
  the beautiful scripts that these emerge from open such vast spaces for exploration.
  It was then decided that I\u2019ll pick up our very own Devanagari, the mother of
  many Indic languages, a very few of them being Hindi, Marathi and Nepali.\r\n\r\nIn
  this entire exploration exercise, I made it a point to do whatever I wanted to on
  my own terms and conditions. I picked up Devanagari for the same and what followed
  was an interesting series of revelations.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things that is
  obvious and comes to anybody\u2019s notice is how there is clearly a \u2018Roof\u2019
  to the entire typeface here. The roof that is actually a line from which all the
  consonants in the alphabet hang is a part of the entire typeface and plays a major
  role in even differentiating the pronunciation of many words that are formed.\r\n\r\nAnother
  thing is the many prominent features such as the \u2018matras\u2019 that I labelled
  as being a part of the ionosphere that is above the supporting \u2018Roof\u2019
  of the words. Again there is also the prominent \u2018Mantle\u2019 that is below
  the main region and which also houses a lot of  things (matras, pronunciation supporters
  etc.) There are amongst all of these, prominent features in the typeface, like the
  \u2018Nose\u2019, the \u2018Hive\u2019 and the \u2018Cusp\u2019 etc, which are a
  feature of many consonants, in Hindi and give a prominent character to the entire
  alphabet.\r\n\r\nTaking reference from the basics, typefaces by convention are comprised
  of lines that are either, straight, curved or slanted. In the Devanagari script
  too, it is an amazing amalgamation of the three and the formations when noted carefully
  are beautifully set together.\r\n\r\nEditor\u2019s Note: I would personally suggest
  the readers who are familiar with scripts other than Latin to try and study those
  scripts with the new light and fundamentals explained here. I cannot say that it
  will help you create brilliant typographic designs but yes it will give you insights
  that will not be learnt any other way."

  body: If you're interested in a typeface designer's take on this same topic, you
    might look at Fiona Ross' diagram in her book <em>The Printed Bengali Character
    and its Evolution</em>. Although the diagram is of the Bengali script, there are
    several common features between Devanagari and Bengali.

  body: "Hey Paul,\r\n\r\nYes, Hindi and Bengali though do not belong to the same
    scripts, have certain native characteristics in common. However, the formation
    of the alphabets is quite different in both the cases.\r\nI'll surely take a look
    at the book you've recommended here.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAditya"
