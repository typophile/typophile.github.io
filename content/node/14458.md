  is the difference between the [[Clarendon]] digitizations between Monotype,\r\nLinotype,
  and Bitstream? The Adobe page indicates that Linotype owns the actual\r\nname. Is
  this how Monotype and Bitstream can legally distribute their own copies\r\nof the
  face, by adding \"MT\" and \"BT\" to the names?\r\n\r\nAs you can see I'm unfamiliar
  with copyright law as it applies to type.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEnrico"
