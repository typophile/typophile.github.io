body: "what major events/parts should be looked at when it comes to the development
  of the [[serif]]?\r\n1) how it came to be i.e. stone chisseled by Romans etc and
  then the Gothic period and how it dissappeared until renaissance\r\n2) roman numerals\r\n3)
  Trajans column\r\n4) Renaissance\r\n5) the guy who developed serif from the human
  proportions of the body...forgot his name, sorry.\r\nwhat about after renaissance
  period? what happened to the serif from then until now and how has it developed?
  any major events that i have missed out from the above list? i can look at how garamond
  and other classical typefaces have extended through out centuries but dont know
  much about who did them and why and how though. what about how is it developing
  today? are people designing their own SERIF fonts and why serif and not san serif?
  is it possible to design a serif font with such precision like Romans did today
  and why is it still used?"
