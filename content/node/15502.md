  headers in a book published by The Knickerbocker Press in 1914. Any help would be
  greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nRobert"

    luck yet. I am republishing an old text and can, of course, use scanned versions,
    but I'd prefer to utilize the crispness of a font.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nRobert"

  body: No exact match here (which I doubt you'll get nearly a century later), but
    it appears to be a variation on the old typeface Tudor Text - the only digitization
    of which I'm aware is <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/blackjewels/index.htm"

  body: Ah. The short showing of Psalter Text in the Solotype Catalog has a single
    story 'a', but, otherwise, does seem to match up better. I know of no digital
    version of that typeface, though. Do you, David?

  body: "I found Psalter Text digitally. See it on the 4th line down on <a href=\"http://www.romana-hamburg.de/fraktur5.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">this page</a> of Gerhard Helzel's extensive collection of Fraktur
    fonts.\r\n\r\nHe seems to be saying there that Mediaeval Gotisch by Flinsch and
    Psalter Gotisch by Krebs were the same typeface. Does that sound right, David?\r\n\r\nI
    communicated with Herr Helzel not long ago (about the otherwise undigitized <a
    href=\"http://www.romana-hamburg.de/antiqua.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Derby</a>).
    He prefers that the indicated amount in Euros be mailed to him, after which he
    will e-mail the font(s)."

    need ascertain whether he has a digital version. Hopefully he responds to his

    the availability of Mac and PC, Truetype or PS. And, from my own recent experience,
    he does respond to e-mail (the same day in my case).\r\n\r\nI just returned from
    a trip to the bank to obtain the needed Euros. What beautiful currency!"
