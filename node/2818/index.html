		<div class="commentbody">For Microsoft and other companies that bundle software, there is a practical reason that has nothing to do with forbidding font modifications per se but with simplifying licensing. It is much easier in every respect to have a single license that covers your entire software produce, including bundled components &ndash; be they fonts, dlls or whatever &ndash; than to have multiple licenses for different aspects of your product. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember: Microsoft is not a font foundry.

		<div class="commentbody">Mr Earls, my personal opinion is that the owner of intellectual property has the moral right to dictate how that property is used by others, within the limits of fair use as recognised by law. I think there is a good argument to be made that modifying a font for your own personal use should constitute fair use, but it is important to remember that this is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->legal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> argument: fair use is an apportioning of rights decided by legislators and courts, not something that users can arbitrarily claim for themselves because it seems right. Good intellectual property law seeks to define and protect the rights of both author and user, and should ideally represent a balance of interests. It takes into consideration both the private good of the author and the public good of the society. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tiro EULAs generally permit font modification for personal use, and some also permit modification for redistribution under certain conditions (typically, the condition that recipients of the modified fonts also have valid licenses for the original font). Since any such modified font is a derivative work [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->'Tiro Typeworks maintains copyright to all derivative fonts in any format.'<!-- raw HTML omitted -->], some of our licenses require that copies of modified fonts be sent to us, and we reserve the right to incorporate the same or similar modifications into future versions of our own releases. This also helps us keep track of the possible source of a modified font if we receive support calls from someone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, who are these font house you want to 'get real'? Again, the vast majority of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->foundries<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do permit modifications to fonts in their EULAs. Microsoft is not a foundry, it's a software company and software companies license <!-- raw HTML omitted -->software<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, usually according to a standard EULA that does not make a distinction between a font, a dll, or any other bundled piece of code. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Formal law is incompatible with human nature.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sadly, law exists because of (corrupted) human nature, because people cannot be relied upon to treat each other with 'common decency'. And what is such decency in terms of font use? Is decency really 'common' &ndash; i.e. generally recognised &ndash;, or is it debateable, composed of conflicting interests seeking balance. You think decency demands that foundries permit font modification, and you hold them responsible for the illegal behaviour of people who ignore license agreements that prohibit this. I think decency demands that users respect the terms of license agreements into which they enter: if you don't like the agreement, don't agree to it. If you agree to it and then break it, no one is responsible but you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As stated, above, all Tiro EULAs permit modification for personal use, and I think this is a good thing. But I respect the right of any of my colleagues to disagree and to prohibit modification, and I certainly understand the motivation of software companies to simplify their licensing by treating fonts the same way they treat other code.</div>
