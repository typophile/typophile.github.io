    the toilet bowl looking up at the anus. No really, I'm not trying to be funny.
    They really do look like that. Also, the C and B in the mark don't stand out strongly
    as those letters. Many peeple will look at it and not see any letters at all.\r\n\r\nAdvise
    trying some other ideas, visual motifs that symbolize the psychological predicament
    named \"creative block\".\r\n\r\nAlso advise not using the spelling \"bloc\" as
    many people will associate that word with Eastern Bloc european countries and
    communism. Unlsee you want that association. Up to you.\r\n\r\nWould you consider
    using another name altogether for your creative agency?\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    might have just been me.\r\n\r\nI do like the idea of something to symbolize the
    psychological \"creative block\"\r\nIts just getting it into a good visual.\r\nI
    tried some things like doodle motifs, but havnt got anything from that really.\r\nIf
    you have any ideas, or anything that springs to mind, let me know! \r\n\r\nI've
    been thinking about the name alot,too much maybe! im at the point where i really
    just want to get something out there.\r\nI quite like the name, i think it could
    work.  "

    suggest making the \"c\" more of a cube instead of a rectangular prism. Also,
    I'm not sure I like the extra stroke around everything \u2014 it makes it seem
    more like university/college lettering.\r\n\r\npenn"

    aesthetic to pull it off. Plus, hey, it'd be fun.

  body: "Ha, that's funny, the new version immediately made me think of an university.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the original style, it seems like it's sort of contradiction to use such a
    rounded C when you're trying to say it's a bloc. Why not just take the Lego approach
    and make a C out of blocks, with minuet spacing between each block?"
