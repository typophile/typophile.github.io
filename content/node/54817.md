  but haven't found anything too useful.\r\n\r\nI've got a job designing and laying
  out the student magazine for my university this year and am looking for a clean,
  contemporary body font to do so.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Courier+Sans/|Courier
  Sans]] would be great but at NZ$470 is a bit too expensive for such a task, but
  is the sort of thing I'd love to use. The best I've found so far is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/testpilot/saarikari/regular/|Saarikari]],
  which at about NZ$180 isn't too unreasonable, and has that nice pseudo-monospaced
  feel, and handles pretty well at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nIf anyone had any suggestions
  for something else that might be in the vein of what I'm after I'd love to hear
  them.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!"

    fonts are actually pretty nice, and open source (at least some of them), but I'm
    not sure if that's what you're looking for.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/saxMono\">SAX
    Mono</a> is maybe a little closer to what you're looking for, though?"

    of money, just not the kind Courier Sans demands\u2014it tends to be necessary
    for the variation in weights and italics I'd like, which unfortunately SAX Mono
    is missing, as it is quite nice.\r\n\r\nI'm not necessarily after something that
    is monospaced, just the feel of it, without necessarily being so\u2014if you know
    what I mean.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help nonetheless!"

  body: Did you see the [[http://www.lineto.com/1.0/content_0.html|link]]? It's not
    as Courier as it sounds, i.e. is proportional.

  body: "I did see the link (and I know what you meant by \"pseudo-monospaced\").
    Courier has so many idiosyncracies that you can't evoke it and stay reasonably
    readable. It's monoline, its serifs look like stems, but most of all it's monospaced.
    Being monospaced is a curse in terms of readability; pretending to be monospaced
    is just diluting that curse. Is it possible to dilute it enough? Maybe, but I
    highly doubt it. I think when you dilute it enough you've already gone way beyond
    looking monospaced at all. Probably because readability is in a different ballpark
    than conscious evaluation. And I haven't even elaborated on it being monoline
    and having ridiculous serifs.\r\n\r\nCourier is simply not something to emulate
    for extended reading, no\r\nmatter how much it might appeal to a certain ideology
    or aesthetic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I agree with its monolinity being a downfall, but the sans version certainly
    isn't monospaced, and doesn't have serifs much more than an accentuated t.\r\n\r\nI
    very much appreciate what you've said, but wonder if you have any particular suggestions
    for fonts that might fit the bill, relative to what we've both said. Something
    <em>slightly</em> removed from the serifs/sans-serifs generally used for body
    copy."

    were looking for, but I can't remember what it was or how I found it--I was looking
    at something else.
