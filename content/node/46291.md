  looking for some feedback.\r\n\r\nThe logo had to be in a round \"seal\" format
  to pay homage to the parent companies logo.\r\n\r\nIt has to convey tradition and
  history while having a modern touch to look to the future.\r\n\r\nThank you for
  taking time to look/comment.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LB_3532.jpg]"

  body: "Make it work in one color first. Also balance the weights of the strokes
    in relation to each other and the type weight.\r\n\r\nWatch out with beige and
    white together--they tend to blend together.\r\n\r\nI would also work on other
    versions with a seal with whatever icon you decide and keep the business name
    in straight text next to the seal. It will read better, because right now you
    are trying to squeeze a hell of a lot of text into the seal.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "Thank you for all your comments so far!\r\nClashmore I agree on Lawrenceville
    being a little tight in there, I will work on that.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Adnix,
    while I can do versions of the logo with the logotype next to it, it would only
    be for fun. The client has requested a seal containing all of the information

  body: I am not sure if the oblique "SUPPLY" (bottom) works on a round path.

  body: I could go either way. I like the modern feel of the right, but the left has
    a more antique feel too it which I like as well.

  body: "VERSION ONE: \r\n\r\n'brick and masonry' does not curve enough with circle
    above. Too much red. I would (for now at least) work in black and white. I think
    the beige shadow in LAWRENCEVILLE is distracting. 'Supply' should not be oblique.
    Lines connecting 'SUPPLY' also do not match the seal outline.\r\n\r\nVERSION TWO:\r\n\r\n'LAURENCEVILLE'
    needs to be lower to give equal space on top and bottom.\r\n\r\nMy preference
    right now is version two but mainly due to the more balanced color pallete."

  body: "These look really striking. My initial criticism is towards the illustration
    of the brick and trowel. I think it's a little too soft, and almost reminds me
    of a icon instead of an illustration.\r\n\r\nPlsu, I agree with Robert... that
    text needs some breathing room. It's slammed into a space that's a little too
    tight. And I don't like how the Brick & Masonry sit so close to supply. Even bricks
    have a bed of mortar to keep thing spaced. Don't use an italics font along a curve
    either, it's a bad design choice.\r\n\r\nI do like the color palette, you have
    a solid foundation to build from with these first designs. It just needs some
    technical tweaking."
