body: 'I find very interesting that Akzidenz Grotesk, a truly seminal typeface for
  the development of sanserif, has no known author.  <BR> <BR>Berthold released it
  in 1896 &#40;or 1898?-the date varies depending on the source, any ideas why?&#41;
  <BR> <BR>What was the context in which it appeared? Robert Bringhurst in The Elements
  of Typographic Style relates it to the Realist movement in art, do you know of any
  book or article in which this is further discussed? <BR> <BR>Another question for
  typophiles: Is the g of AG one of the firts in having a tail instead of a ring?
  What is the origin of that transformation? <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot <BR>'
