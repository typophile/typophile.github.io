  but have no idea where to look for it. This sample is from a font ID request I received,
  and I am almost positive I have this font, and I think it's an old design. I am
  sure I have at least seen it somewhere, but none of my Guides or font searches have
  found it. this may have been a freebie from the web, but I just can't remember any
  details, and it's driving me crazy.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize this?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help, \r\n- Mike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OSantoDaime_3434.png]"
