body: I need help with advice on getting a logo copyrighted. Does anyone know of a
  good company/website that does a good job handling it, and at a decent price? (and
  please no advice about poor-mans copyright) thanks in advance.

    done. It\u2019s a different thing if you want to register your trademark. I don\u2019t
    know anything about that, though."

    to prove it was in fact done by me, in a legal manner.

    or post a copy to yourself by registered mail which gives you a clear date and
    keeping the envelope unopened until you are challenged (or make a challenge).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.benedict.com/\r\n\r\nThis
    might help. Sensible thing to do would be to get proper legal advice though.\r\nTim"

  body: "timd...I think that's more of an old wives tale than anything.\r\n\r\nYes,
    you own the copyright BY DEFAULT on any work you create. In the US, though, the
    damages you could potentially collect from an infringment case are very much reduced
    unless you REGISTER the copyright. That doesn't require a lawyer. $45 and a completed
    form is all you need:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.copyright.gov/register/\r\n\r\nRegistering
    a Trademark is a separate issue:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.uspto.gov/\r\n\r\nTMs are where
    having a lawyer can come in handy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    envelope things is indeed an old wives tale, bogus. Mostly becasue they can be

    you mail it to yourself via REGISTERED MAIL, the US Postal Service maintains an
    UNBROKEN CHAIN OF EVIDENCE (signature logs) of every individual who handled the
    piece, from the time the Post Office accepts it until the time it is delivered
    into your hands. The received envelope MUST remain unopened in order for the chain
    to remain unbroken. While a person may be able to fake the USPS round stamps that
    mark every seam on the envelope, the signature log CANNOT be faked...unless, of
    course, you have access to the safes in which the logs are stored."

      a copyright.  Not something that would hold up in court."
