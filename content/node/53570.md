  a book about children's book cover designs. I think this book cover is eye catching.
  It caught my eye the second I seen it. The cover is basically a photogragh of different
  children's books. The artists of the covers wanted to use many colors to catch the
  eye. I think they were successful at doing so."

    (one I have read), called <a href=\"http://www.octopusbooks.co.uk/books/general/9781845332426/front-cover/\"><em>Front
    Cover</em></a>, which is a nice collection/history of book covers from Great Britain
    and the U.S.\r\n\r\nTypographica reviewed that one <a href=\"http://typographica.org/000834.php\">here</a>."

  body: "This <em>Iliad and Odyssey</em> is illustrated by Alice and Martin Provensen
    and is, IMO, one of the greatest feats of book illustration ever accomplished.
    Unfortunately, the scans I made from this book all seem to be gone from my hard
    drive and I am on my way out. \r\n\r\nThere is a website that features some of
    the illustrations [[http://iliadodyssey.com/site/main.html|here]]. Unfortunately
    the site cannot show you the brilliant integration of images and text as they
    appear in the book. The lettering is also outstanding\u2014they had to do this
    separately for all the languages (at least English, German, and French).\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I found one scan of part of one of the illustrations from the German edition:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ilias,
    67 small_4851.jpg]"
