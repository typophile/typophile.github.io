body: I've been tasked with redrawing this logo in vector format, so unfortunately
  this is the best image I have. The flat-bottomed 'M' is throwing me for a loop.
  I've compared against the usual suspects - Bodoni, Torino, Didot, their variants,
  and less common didones - and nearly all are wider and have pointy 'M's with a wider
  flair on the left leg serif. As far as I can tell, this hasn't been mechanically
  condensed. The closest I've found is Ambroise, but the proportions don't quite match
  up.

  body: Thanks for the tip, defiantone. The deadline hit and I decided to redraw the
    letterforms from scratch. Being a geometrically simple face, this wasn't terribly
    difficult.
