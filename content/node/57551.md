  few type-related graphs of online searching patterns:\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.google.com/trends?q=fonts|Fonts]]\r\n[[http://www.google.com/trends?q=typography&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0|Typography]]\r\n[[http://www.google.com/trends?q=type+design&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0|Type
  Design]]\r\n[[http://www.google.com/trends?q=typefaces&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0|Typefaces]]\r\n\r\nMy
  guess is the downward slide of terms like \"fonts\" (in particular) and \"typefaces\"
  are due to the siren song of free fonts wearing off on the general population. I'm
  guessing that \"typography\" follows patterns in the school year, too."
