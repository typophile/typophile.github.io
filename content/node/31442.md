body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nLast night while experimenting with type, I came up
  with this idea of having a 3d wire frame typeface. Although its very graphic but
  can be used for some specific purpose, like in posters and the magazine headings.
  But the problem is that each glyph is becoming too heavy and dunno whether it will
  be possible to export them as a typeface or not. I have all the drawings in the
  vector format. What do you guys think_? Is it possible anyhow_? Anyone_??\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nSatya_\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_6291.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4975.jpg]"

  body: They are very nice forms. To be fonts it would depends on the number of points
    - they would have to be truetype and in the past some complex fonts have used
    more than one glyph window for one character. I digitized some ornate Victorian
    typefaces a few years ago and had problems with them not printing or having bizarre
    lines develope. Your forms look to me like they will have to remain vector art
    - just too complex.

  body: That's really terrific, Satya. I have absolutely no clue as to the feasibility
    of what you're suggesting, having had little experience actually creating fonts,
    but I've never seen anything that looks remotely like this. I especially love
    how you're able to create a real sense of depth with the crossbar of the t and
    the overlaps of the "fabric." One thing I'm not crazy about, though, is breaking
    off the "serifs" of the s, as you've done here; I'd rather if the letterforms
    were all unbroken. Again, good luck, and sorry I couldn't answer your question.

    could consider releasing it as individual EPS files.

  body: Veer's about page that you linked to said that Corey Holms created Pea, if
    that's what your question was, Satya. But if you read what it says, he made his
    using "elaborate calligraphic swashes," which is somewhat different from what
    you're doing. So I would continue to pursue yours, definitely.

    inspiration), I came across <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/calypso/>Calypso
    D</a>, which reminded me of your project in its folding. Obviously, they're quite
    different, but the three-dimensionality of Calypso was striking -- especially
    since Wikipedia says he designed it in 1958.
