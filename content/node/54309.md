body: "The San Francisco Chronicle rolled out a redesign yesterday. I don't know any
  of the details about who did what, or what they are now using (Archer for section
  heads and subs). The old design was one I often lauded in these forums, especially
  the sturdy elegance of Parkinson's Electra adaptations. From a type perspective,
  I'd have liked to see them update their headline sans and call it good. Now it feels
  like they did a trendy typographic mashup with no cohesive style. Nothing wrong
  with the individual types they used mind you; I'm sure this largely just my reaction
  to change. It will be interesting to see the broader reaction and how it evolves.
  In the mean time... Michael Phelps smoked pot *wow* \r\n\r\n"

    Front Pages section.\r\n\r\nLooks like Farnham for both headlines and text, Antenna
    for sans, and Archer for section heads, et al. Some interesting choices -- as
    you say, Randy, a bit of a mash-up. \r\n\r\nSeems a bit less serious and more
    lifestyle oriented than hard-hitting news.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: "I like the use of Archer in the section heads, but I feel like it clashes
    with Farnham where they've stuck the two together.\r\n\r\nI also think they've
    misused Farnham for the big bold headlines. On the main head of Sunday's front
    page, the combination of somewhat loose leading and jamming it up against the
    photos to the left looks really clunky to me.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see them use
    a lighter weight of the Farnham for the headlines (and possibly a slightly larger
    type size to compensate) and let the idiosyncrasies of the face shine through.
    Also, the mix with Archer for the kickers might work better if the two faces were
    more similarly weighted. The bold Farnham works better in smaller headlines --
    the leading looks like it's the same as in the larger headlines -- perhaps it
    just works better smaller."

    columns, separated by rules running down the length of the body.\r\n\r\nUgh, did
    they actually <strong>want</strong> me to read this? It's not a serious redesign
    at all, and reader response has been mostly disgust (as far as I can tell from
    the SF Gate comments). For a paper that mostly prints wire stories and drastically
    reduced their number of writers, the redesign is a classic example of fixing the
    one thing that wasn't broken.\r\n\r\nOh, and the newsstand price is now 75\xA2
    a copy. Draw your own conclusions.\r\n"

    less than 18 pt. I wouldn't want to alienate a core customer, but they probably
    weren't happy about the type size before, either.

    several issues, but it is hard to put aside your initial reaction. "

  body: '@cheshiredave - I think the reason that Farnham doesn''t seem to work is
    because it allows no contrast with the flag. I still don''t think Archer was the
    right choice. I appreciate it, but not in this instance. Can anyone confirm if
    they used display or text? If they were using a sans instead of Farnham or a less
    formal serif Archer might work. Even still, the flag is old school blackletter
    and I''d argue it still wouldn''t work.'

    I thought Archer was one-size-fits-all. \r\n\r\nThe Chronicle is using both Farnham
    Display (heads) and Text (text).\r\n\r\nRegarding the heads: I can't help but
    think that the overall look might have been stronger and a tad more serious if
    they had commissioned a custom, slightly narrower version of Farnham specifically
    for headlines.\r\n\r\nBut, I'm not looking at the paper in hand, and it's a bit
    unfair to judge a newspaper from a PDF.\r\n\r\n-- K."
