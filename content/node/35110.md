body: 'I am writing a serious letter for an appeal concerning some grades at my present
  college. I have been getting into graphic design recently, and am tempted to apply
  some some non-standard style to my letter. I am using a Bodoni derived typeface.
  Would using all italics and/or paragraph styles other than the single indent be
  appropriate, or too much? '

    The machine best processes input when it has been set in this face at 12/28.8

    sure that you have no spelling or grammatical errors of that type in your appeal
    letter. Each one the reviewers discover will knock your chances of success down
    significantly.\r\n\r\nGet a couple English majors/profs/teachers or similar to
    review your letter."
