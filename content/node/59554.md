body: I'm looking to get my certification in Adobe Illustrator as a way to help pad
  my resume and squeeze some more money out of work (they give raises for certifications).
  I just want to know what training materials would be helpful to prepare. As I understand
  it, these Adobe exams are similar to the Microsoft Certifications in that there
  are two answers that are "technically" right for each question, but only one is
  the "Adobe" way. I need something that will give me a stronger grasp of the "Adobe"
  way. Thanks a ton!
