body: I&#39;ve been hired by a major advertising firm &#40;thanks to my art director
  friend&#41; to design a font from the logo of a multi-million dollar company.  There
  is no existing font from which the logo was created. <BR> <BR>This is my first time
  designing an entire typeface for a specific product/company.  In the past, I&#39;ve
  designed logos from my own font designs, but never in this scope. <BR> <BR>My main
  question is- how much do I charge?  And are there resources where I can find this
  information? <BR> <BR>Thanks.

    for your design work? <BR> <BR>Based on 30 to 50 hours, which is in the ball park
    for such work. <BR> <BR>$100, $150 $200 per hour. <BR> <BR>Simple multiplication

  body: 'Just curious, James, as I&#39;ve never done this kind of work before: Wouldn&#39;t
    you factor in some sort of multiplier on top of a simple hourly charge, since
    the type will presumably become part of this mega-corp&#39;s identity? <BR> <BR>Surely
    most corporate identity folks charge more for a logo, for example, than just the
    time it took to develop it. <BR> <BR>&#40;Not that $10,000 [50 hrs. x $200] is
    anything to sneeze at.&#41; '

  body: Every project is different. There was quite a discussion on this awhile back.
    Lots of factors could affect the final price. Size of the implementation &#40;How
    many workstations and in how many locations?&#41; and What level of exclusivity
    will be granted.

    to track this down, but the only Von Clauswitz I&#39;m finding is the war historian,
    and unless he was very interested in cartographic lettering I&#39;m missing something.
    Help? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I thought it was a joke, and in fact referred to &#42;that&#42; Von Clauswitz.
    At least, I laughed pretty hard, so I hope it was a joke.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    should be recommended reading for client negotiations. <BR>George
