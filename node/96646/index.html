  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I&rsquo;m starting on my first serious Hebrew companion to a font in the works. I&rsquo;m far from professional or even good, I&rsquo;d say. Either way, I found that resources about Hebrew text are very rare, and while I could fine plenty of resources about latin character design, I find myself doing mostly guesswork when it comes to Hebrew.</p>
<p>So I managed to figure out a lot of things by myself just from looking at how existing known fonts look: shin connects to the left side, samech is kind of like a lowercase sigma as opposed to final mem, and so forth. But still, I know virtually nothing besides.</p>
<p>The other thing is that (naturally) Hebrew letters are constructed somewhat differently from latin characters. I have a hard time really finding which components I should match up. There are certain things between different latin characters which are kept roughly the same throughout most characters (serifs, stems, etc) but I don&rsquo;t really know which ones I should match, really.</p>
<p>If you have any useful tips, tricks, resources and such about this subject, I&rsquo;d love to know.</p>
<p>Also a more specific question now. Should my final nun reach all the way down to the same descender as the latin characters in the font? If so, wouldn&rsquo;t that be far too long?</p>
<p>Thanks
Adi</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on Hebrew (I&rsquo;ve only done highly imitative designs in that script) so hopefully you&rsquo;ll get some good replies from people with more specific experience, but from my long experience designing non-Latin type in general I will state one thing, and quite strongly: make sure you don&rsquo;t bend the Hebrew to the will of the Latin. Too many people who make non-Latin type value formal harmony between shapes so highly that they ignore what a script truly needs to function well. For example, serifs: don&rsquo;t do what Eric Gill did!

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Adi,</p>
<p>I have written a little on how I designed companion Latin fonts for my Hebrew Font Shuneet see &ldquo;Matching Hebrew and Latin&rdquo; on 15 Oct 2010.  I would stress that in no way do the two fonts look alike!  They are companions - they go together and coexist comfortably when displayed or printed on the same page. On my website [[ http://hebrew-font-shuneet.com ]] you will see many examples of Hebrew and English side-by-side.</p>
<p>If you look at the Introduction on my web site you will see that I have spent about forty years at this activity.  I began with calligraphy and did not imagine that would lead to font design.</p>
<p>Your intention is to design a Hebrew font. I don&rsquo;t know what level of knowledge you have concerning the language &hellip;but I can&rsquo;t imagine that a person who doesn&rsquo;t know some Hebrew could do this.</p>
<p>What I suggest is this. Find an existing Hebrew font that you can add to your own font and import the characters. You will need to find a font with a suitable license. I did this for my Hebrew font by importing the Latin characters of Tuffy.</p>
<p>Clearly Tuffy doesn&rsquo;t look like a Hebrew font in any way. I did not change my imported Tuffy to &ldquo;look Hebrew&rdquo; however I did change it to have some of the characteristics of the Hebrew Font Shuneet, for instance I modified it so that the stroke width was more constant, also I changed the stroke terminators to match, and so on&hellip;</p>
<p>You can copy the example texts from my web site, change the English to your font then look around for a free Hebrew font that will make a tolerable companion.</p>
<p>Good luck, Mike</p>

<p>[[http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/biblicalfonts.aspx|SBL Hebrew]] designed by John Hudson and [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=EzraSIL_Home|SIL&rsquo;s Ezra]] might be a good places to start.

<p>Some licenses,  for instance the one I use for the Hebrew Font Shuneet are for &ldquo;free&rdquo; fonts where &ldquo;free&rdquo; is to be interpreted as in &lsquo;free speech&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;free beer&rsquo;(!)</p>
<p>When you use font A as a source for another font B, the license of the new font B may not be more restrictive than the original license of A, which means that the license of font B must also be free (or even more free).</p>

<p>That may be, but even that level of success may not always be achieved. Thus, the Unicode font &ldquo;Caslon Roman&rdquo; resembles the kind of Roman letters often found with Chinese or Japanese DBCS fonts, and I think they are failures&hellip; a non-native may not know <em>what to look for</em> when attempting to imitate precedent.</p>
