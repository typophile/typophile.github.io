  by both Typeshop and Softmaker, i.e. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/nashville/|TS
  Nashville]] (note the design owner is \u2018Quick Brown Fox\u2019) and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/nashville-serial//|Nashville
  Serial]].\r\n\r\nI did some research and read on a thread here the story about [[http://www.typophile.com/node/52651|Sean
  Cavanaugh]]\u2019s SoftMaker. And whilst doing more research I found this on another
  thread \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201CTypeshop Collection\u201D, which, as it seems,
  is the former Quick Brown Fox \u201CSerials Typecollection\u201D, which is the former
  Brendel & Pabst \u201CSerial Type Collection\u201D.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo what's
  the story with TypeShop, are they both reselling old URW typefaces? And if \u2018Serials
  Typecollection\u2019 is from TypeShop, why is SoftMaker using the \u2018Serial\u2019
  suffix? And who are Brendel & Pabst and Typeshop (the description on myfonts didn't
  explain what I would like to know)?!"

  body: That Brendel document looks interesting, unfortunately I don't read German...
    On Luc Devroye's pages I found about 3 lines on Typeshop/Softmaker which gets
    its source information from Uli Stiehl anyway which I find a little suspect anyway
    having read Sean Cavanaugh's side of the story on TypeShop, I find the accusations
    of piracy doubtful.

  body: "> I find the accusations of piracy doubtful\r\n\r\nIt depends on how you
    define \"piracy\" in this madhouse font forging industry.\r\n\r\nAs is proved
    by old catalogs, the Serials stuff was made (\"designed\") decades ago.\r\n\r\nMyfonts
    claiming that \"Glasgow\", \"Nashville\" etc. were \"designed\" in \"2010\", will
    have to explain to font buying madmen that these ripped-off (sorry, \"designed\")
    fonts labeled \"Design date: 2010\" by Myfonts are contained in catalogs printed
    decades ago.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/Nashville.jpg\r\n\r\n>
    (note the design owner is \u2018Quick Brown Fox\u2019)\r\n\r\nThis outfit did
    not exist at the time when the old catalogs were printed. Hence QBF could not
    be the \"design owner\"."

    dog of forgery or piracy, so one can''t claim unfairness there. Of course, he
    could accuse me of either, since my current hobby project involves taking a Rundfunk
    mutt (either Fund or FundRunk, I forgot which) and rebuilding it into the kind
    of Rundfunk I think it should be.'

    large-sized 530-page thread-sewn catalog of the former German photocomposition
    company \"TypoBach\" published more than 30 years ago.\r\n\r\nThis huge font catalog
    also includes hundreds of \"Serials\" photocomposition fonts of many trademarked
    fonts, depicted as \"backmatter\" on pages 331 through 502 of this huge catalog,
    e.g.\r\n\r\n- \"Helvetica Serial 1\" through \"Helvetica Serial 13\",\r\n- \"Optima
    Serial 1\" through \"Optima Serial 9\", etc.\r\n\r\nOn page 329 of this catalog,
    Typobach claims that these \"Serials\" are the \"Exclusiv-Schriften\" of the TypoBach
    company.\r\n\r\nFrom the technical point of view, these \"exclusive fonts\" are
    photographically modified versions of original fonts produced by other font companies.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems that the ripoff companies Brendel & Pabst, Elsner & Flake, etc. grapped
    these Serials fonts, renamed them and sold them as their own \"original\" fonts
    to which they claimed authorship.\r\n"

    & Pabst and the Typeshop group of phototypesetting houses. He also co-founded
    the European Typeface Corporation (ETC) which was connected with Typo Bach, another
    group of phototypesetting houses. Together with Peter Karow, Brendel worked on
    the initial version of Ikarus and developed the phototypesetting machine Unitype
    for which he created a large range of typeface families. Most of these were based
    on existing typeface designs, which had typically been made fit for creating a
    range of 7 weights from extra light to extra bold by interpolation and have been
    marketed as \u2018Serials\u2019 for some years. Currently, the Type Shop / Serials
