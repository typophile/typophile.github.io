  body: 'I emailed lineto. <BR>Here&#39;s what they wrote back: <BR> <BR> <BR>dear
    karl frankowski, <BR> <BR>thank you for your recent inquiry at lineto.com, and
    for your interest in <BR>the &#39;alpha headline&#39; font. <BR> <BR>&#39;alpha
    headline&#39; was designed by cornel windlin in 1993, and was first <BR>released
    on the lineto site at its start in 1999, where it has been one of <BR>the most
    popular fonts. it has been taken off our library very recently <BR>because it
    is being developed into a family of four fonts, including a <BR>newly-designed
    full lower case sets, for the exclusive use of one client. <BR>the licensing agreement
    prevents us from selling the fonts for the next 10 <BR>years. <BR> <BR>we will
    be removing the type specimen from the site at our next site update, <BR>when
    we will present a number of exciting new typefaces from various lineto <BR>designers.
    please let me know if you would like to be notified once the <BR>update is online.
    <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>So for the next 10 years, I guess
    we&#39;ll have to use <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?4W1">carplates</a>.

    too small, too light, etc.
