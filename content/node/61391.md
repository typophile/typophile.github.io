  | Myfonts.com]].\r\n\r\nCrewekerne, Crewekerne Magna and Crewekerne Magister are
  three related typeface families which speak of the villages that are at the heart
  of English life. They are inspired by the arts and crafts movement of the early
  twentieth century. Three widths \u2013 condensed, regular and expanded and three
  weights \u2013 regular bold and heavy are offered. Crewekerne is especially good
  when combined with its two complimentary families and when used in poster and design
  work that needs a rustic hand crafted flair but still needs to be easily legible.\r\n\r\nWhy
  not try them out for yourself on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/crewekerne/
  | Myfonts.com]]. In the meantime, there are examples of the Crewekerne faces in
  use on our  [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]].\r\n\r\n"
