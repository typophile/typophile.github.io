  <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28277#comment-160533\">AFDKO 2.0 thread</a>,
  i'm trying to include the DFLT script tag as he outlined, but i'm getting the error\r\n<code>[WARNING]
  <XXXX> Use of DFLT tag has been deprecated. It will work, but please use 'dflt'
  instead.</code>\r\nIs this a FontLab bug? or am i likely doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nAttached
  below is a screen capture of how i have things set up:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/otpdh100406_6533.png]"

    we're currently using a different approach on Adobe's fonts. We handle the laguage-specific
    substitutions in the 'locl' feature, and make a 'liga' feature with no lookups.
    For more info on this, read pages 97\u2013102 of the <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/temp/Slye_Lisbon-2006.pdf\">presentation
    that Christopher Slye gave at ATypI in Lisbon</a>."

    that's true. i was just trying to get the DFLT script tag to work, but apparently
    it isn't supported by FLS5 at this time. Thnx for showing how the DFLT and dflt
    script/lanugage tags should work in combination with other script/language tags.\r\n\r\n<em>the
    presentation that Christopher Slye gave at ATypI</em>\r\n\r\ni had read this,
    using a localized form of 'i' for turkish is a very good solultion. i'll hafta
    go back over the presentation and see if i can figger out how you write a liga
    feature with NO lookups. >^P"

    I forgot to mention that we're not treating f-ligatures differently for German
    any more. If you still want to do that, yes, you'll need lookups in 'liga', or
    perhaps a different solution in 'locl'.\r\n\r\nHere's how we're doing presently:\r\n<code>\r\nfeature
    locl {\r\n\r\n# \"script DFLT;\" omitted in this feature\r\n# since there is nothing
    to be defined for script DFLT\r\n\r\n\tscript latn;\r\n\t\tlanguage TRK;\r\n\t\t\tlookup
    IDOT {\r\n\t\t\t\tsub i by i.dot;            # i.dot is a duplicate of i\r\n\t\t\t\tsub
    i.sc by i.dotsc;       # i.dotsc is an i.sc with a dot on top\r\n\t\t\t\tsub I.sc
    by Idotaccent.sc; # Idotaccent.sc is a duplicate of i.dotsc\r\n\t\t\t} IDOT;\r\n\r\n\t\tlanguage
    AZE;\r\n\t\t\tlookup IDOT;\r\n\r\n\t\tlanguage CRT;\r\n\t\t\tlookup IDOT;\r\n\r\n}
    locl;\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n\r\n\tsub f f i by f_f_i;\r\n\tsub f f l by
    f_f_l;\r\n\tsub f f by f_f;\r\n\tsub f i by f_i;\r\n\tsub f l by f_l;\r\n\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nSince
    \"script DFLT;\" is not used in this solution, you can test the behavior in FontLab."

    anywhere what its \"best practices\" for OT development are that would list these
    types of changes? Maybe we could get an updated sample feature file? Thanks for
    all you (collectively) do to help the rest of us with OT feature development!"
