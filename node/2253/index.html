  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In De Vinne&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Practice of Typography: Plain Printing Types&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s a sample of a face that&rsquo;s intriguing for its use of what are often called [[hybrid figures|&ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; numerals]]:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/21516_5414.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a collage from a more extensive setting. The font is the #19 of the Phelps, Dalton &amp; Co., and was probably made at the end of the 19th century. This makes it the earliest &ldquo;true&rdquo; hubrid numeral scheme I&rsquo;ve encountered - in fact by far: the most recent ones I knew of previously were in Fenway (Carter) and some of de Groot&rsquo;s work. The Austin numerals (like the kind Carter has recreated in Miller) have some hybrid traits, but I find them too irregular (although in a nice way) to really qualify as a scheme.</p>
<p>Anyway, this might be an opportunity to find a better name for &ldquo;hybrid numerals&rdquo;, and I propose calling them &ldquo;Boston numerals&rdquo;, not just because of this Phelps design, but also because Carter is in Boston. Luc[as] loses out though.  :-(</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>
<p>(I hope Rodolfo and Kent are listening&hellip;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; New England figures. <BR> <BR>That seems much better than &quot;Boston&quot;. <BR>But I'm realizing that if there's going to be any geographic reference, it really needs to be Scotland: both Austin and Phemister were Scottish (although the latter's working life was in New England). The former certainly deserves credit for breaking from the oldstyle/lining polarity*, and the latter might have in fact been the first to discipline the deviation into a clear new style (I might find out when I check out a 1888 Dickinson specimen book at UCLA). Plus in this case I think it's not right to favor Carter anyway, since it seems de Groot did it first (among living designers). <BR> <BR>* Back around 1800. In fact, he (or maybe Bell) also deserves credit for the 3/4 lining numerals, which I also like. There seems to have been a lot of numeral innovation in the Highlands, for some reason. <BR> <BR>So what I'm leaning towards is calling them Phemister, since Scottish is too broad: I'd like to be able to refer to &quot;Bell numerals&quot; (3/4 lining) and &quot;Austin numerals&quot; as well (like in Miller). But that's assuming Austin didn't make the first true hybrids as well! More research required&hellip; <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; Notice dates in Hrant's showing. <BR> <BR>You mean that they predate Goudy? <BR>The absoute latest that font could be is 1902, but it's probably 2-3 decades earler. <BR> <BR>The Forum numerals are interesting, and seem very similar to the ones in ATF Garamond (which did however come a bit later), in that they're a very extreme case of hybrids, almost lining. BTW, I seem to remember Kent pointing out a precedent to the ATF Garamond numerals from around 1900, but I'm not sure. <BR> <BR>&gt; <a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/Bodoni-Roman.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/Bodoni-Roman.html">http://www.lanstontype.com/Bodoni-Roman.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>Those I call &quot;French old-style&quot;, since they were pioneered by the Didots (thanks to Rodolfo for pointing that out, a while back now). And I actually think that vertical arrangement is better than our conventional one, which is too low on the body overall. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

For those new to this thread, these are not French Oldstyle figures. See the very interesting top posting by Hrant. Below is Goudy's version of alternate figures. These follow somewhat Hrant's posting. These are not French Oldstyle Figures. <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/ForumTitleRoman.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/ForumTitleRoman.html">http://www.lanstontype.com/ForumTitleRoman.html</a></a>  <BR> <BR>I suggest Goudy's addition may have been helpful to balance the 1848. See 1848 without such balance, illustrated by Hrant's showing. <BR> <BR>I am a little confused though. First, Hrant you say that your showing is the earliest you have found, but now indicate there were earlier experiments across the great pond. Are the earlier ones consistent with the #19 of the Phelps, Dalton &amp; Co? <BR> <BR>That question aside, I am not sure what they should be named. They are not French Oldstyle, they are too lining to be oldstyle and too oldstyle to be lining. Perhaps <i>old lining figs</i> would do. Tempting as it may be, naming such things after either location, foundry or designer can be a misleading. <BR> <BR>Unless one can clearly establish the source not only to be fact, but to be first in fact.</div>

If I find proof that Phemister made that #19 (noting that he was both punchcutter and designer* for most of his career, certainly after 1872 when he got promoted to full partner at Phelps), and I don't see anything like that in Austin's oeuvre, then &quot;Phemister numerals&quot; it is, since his &quot;lineage&quot; of numeral innovation is strong. <BR> <BR>* Very rare during his era. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

It's what I most dislike about lining numerals in text, and everybody seems to have gotten used to it except me. If you saw a word such as, say, &quot;ions&quot; or &quot;late&quot; set like that, you'd immediately say &quot;fix that crapulous kerning, it practically looks like two words.&quot; What I would like to see more of, on the flip side of these sort-of-lining oldstyle numerals, are non-lining equal-height numerals, with visual kerning on par with letters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Is my face red. Thank you for setting me straight on the terminology, but you can see why I was confused; in most conversations &quot;lining&quot; would seem to be shorthand for lining tabular, and &quot;oldstyle&quot; would seem to be shorthand for oldstyle proportional. I was under the impression that no one had ever yet considered that lining and tabular could be separated, hence my pet peeve. My hand has been out of typography for a long time, and I'm mostly exposed to the &quot;defaults&quot; of the masses, in which lining tabular figures are often all you get.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">'Scotch figures' may be confusing to many people, since there is already a Scotch classification of type, many examples of which do <i>not</i> include this kind of figure. <BR> <BR>I think having what amount to nicknames for different figure styles is fine, but we should first have an accurate way to describe figures. The most important distinction to this discussion is that between lining and ranging figures. The term 'lining figures' is used so commonly for cap-height figures that we tend to forget that it is an abbreviation for 'cap-height lining figures', i.e. of figures that are a common height, aligned to the caps. It is perfectly possible to have lining figures that align to other heights, e.g. to smallcap height, even to x-height and, in the case of Bell's famous figures, 'three-quarter cap height lining figures' (commonly called simply 'three-quarter figures' &ndash; again, an abbreviation). Just as the term 'lining' does not by itself imply anything about the height of the figures &ndash; other than that it is common &ndash;, so the term 'ranging' doesn't necessarily imply oldstyle figures, i.e. figures that range above and below a median defined by the x-height. It is perfectly feasible to have ranging figures that range above and below a median defined by the smallcap height, or even the cap height, although the latter would look very odd. From this it should follow pretty obviously that what we're talking about in this thread, precisely, are <i>three-quarter cap-height ranging figures.</i> Anything else is simply a nickname (of which there might be many: Scotch, Phemister, Boston, etc.) or an abbreviation (three-quarter ranging figs). <BR> <BR> <BR>NB: using 'lining' to mean fixed-width is simply <i>wrong</i>. Lining and ranging describe vertical characteristics of figures; proportional and tabular describe horizontal characteristics. The truth of this is obvious as soon as one sits down to design typefaces with multiple figure styles: cap-height lining proportional, cap-height lining tabular, x-height ranging (oldstyle) proportional, x-height ranging(oldstyle) tabular, smallcap-height lining proportional, smallcap-height lining tabular, etc.</div>

Numerals in fonts have come along way, baby.</p>

Sure, they have a large “zero-height”, but that doesn’t make them a lining-oldstyle hybrid.
Many “normal” oldstyle figures have zero-heights that are larger than x-height.
And many “normal” oldstyle figures have zero and one that are lining-style (rather than a one that looks like a small-cap “I” and a zero that is a monoline circle), but we don&rsquo;t call those hybrids, which IMO would be a more accurate use of the term.</div>

are x-height. It&rsquo;s only quite recently that designers have taken
up the good habit of breaking that established practice. If you
look at fonts from around the time this thread* started you&rsquo;d
be hard-pressed to find hybrid numerals.</p>

<li>It might even be true that hybrid numerals
started spreading faster due to the numerous
Typophile discussions on the topic.</li>

<p>As for the way the zero and one look, that&rsquo;s moot here: we&rsquo;re
talking about height, and the way a couple of numerals look
is not enough to label the whole set of them as a new idea.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bodoni Antiqua (URW++) does have gently hybrid numerals.
BTW, do you know how closely it&rsquo;s based on Bodoni&rsquo;s work?
It would be cool if old Giambattista actually make hybrids.</p>
<p>The digital version of Plantin seems to have full lining nums,
and I don&rsquo;t have any of my metal typeface specimen books
handy. Do you have a link/sample?</p>
<p>Perpetua: The Italic does indeed have nice hybrids, but the
Roman&rsquo;s nums are actually <em>shorter</em> than the x-height! Which is
quite strange. In any case Gill was indeed a numeral innovator;
the tall &ldquo;2&rdquo; in Perpetua&rsquo;s Roman and Joanna is something we
should all be doing frankly. Although the French <em>were</em> ahead of
everybody in terms of OS nums (until they took a break from text
fonts for a while* and when they resumed they picked up some
nasty Anglo habits).</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; to Charles Peignot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preface: those nums are barely a hair taller than the x-height.
I&rsquo;ve seen that done before, but I&rsquo;ve never understood it. Being
a typeface designer I would notice it and believe it&rsquo;s intentional,
but how could it appear as anything but a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; to laymen?
Isn&rsquo;t it a sort of golden rule of visual design to either deviate
clearly or not at all? (Which is not to say that rules shouldn&rsquo;t
be broken - to me it does need to make sense though.)</p>
<p>So, how long did it take you to find ~1.5 examples of
early hybrid numerals? :-)  BTW, the #19 of the Phelps,
Dalton &amp; Co. handily predates those.</p>
