body: "Hi All....\r\n\r\nI'm new here and need some assistance finding a font/typeface
  that can be used both for my company brand print but also for parts of my website.\r\n\r\nMy
  website will reflect my German medal collection created from 1905-1950 but I want
  the main image to reflect primarily the period from WWI to 1920.  I just recently
  had a web designer submit a quick mock up for me in hopes that they would get the
  job.  Needless to say, once I saw the stereotyped \"Old English Gothic\" font being
  used I immediately told them I wasn't interested.\r\n\r\nI am looking for something
  close, or identical, to Fritz H. Ehmcke's designs from the mid- to late teens (see
  link below), or from his contemporary Max Hertwig.  I would even use something from
  the National socialism art of 1938 if I could find something similar to Richard
  Klein's designs.\r\n\r\nAny help or pointers would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nEhmcke

    which was done 1926. Even if not that close to the poster (very nice btw) it has
    some of the feeling from that era. Have a look at MRF and judge yourself...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com"

  body: Looking at your coins, it would seem that two of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/hihretrofonts/"
    target="_blank">Tom Wallace's</a> revivals barely predate your time period, match
    the heritage and fit in nicely with much of the coins' lettering. There's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/secession/"
    target="_blank">Secession</a>, which has the advantage of 3 weights and a lowercase
    and there's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/kunstler-grotesk/"
    target="_blank">Kunstler Grotesk</a>, which has lots of wonderful alternates and
    ligatures.
