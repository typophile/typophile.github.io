  trying to track down the typographer of a free script font that's all over the freebie
  sites.\r\n\r\nFont is Monika Italic [link removed by moderator] and the credit goes
  to \"Catrina\" (for whom I cannot seem to find any info whatsoever).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monika_italic_sample_4520.png]\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to use this in a commercial piece (all accompanying license info says it's
  freeware, but the font file is unembeddable which indicates otherwise). Can anyone
  either point me in the right direction, or perhaps suggest a suitable alternative
  ('50s-era italic script)? This is a pro bono project, so sadly I need to lean toward
  free or cheap.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

    Other than that, no luck.

    Monika Italic is a direct knock-off of Monika Italic with a bit less of a skew.
    Not sure where the numbers are from though.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000069]]"

    \r\n\r\nBoth are different in lot's of the small details. And both seem to be
    independent revivals of an alphabet first published in \"Script and Manuscript
    Lettering\", published by the Higgins Ink Company in 1944.\r\nhttp://www.tiendadelweb.com/121073846013P-script-and-manuscript-lettering-higgins-ink-co-brooklyn-ny-36-pages-1946\r\n\r\nThe
    same set of alphabets, in a much bigger reproduction, was also featured in Architectural
    Lettering for Plans and Ornamental design. by Arthur E. Burke. 1953\r\nhttp://openlibrary.org/books/OL6130009M/Architectural_lettering_for_plans_and_ornamental_design\r\n\r\nThere

    some facts when I think I have some evidence.\r\n\r\nHere is one you will like:
    Saginaw is a commercial TreacyFaces font\r\nhttp://www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFSaginaw_2c5a.html\r\nThe
    light weight is awesome, and true to the original (See the image at the bottom
    of the TreacyFaces page).\r\nThe bold, instead, is ugly and has lost all the charm.\r\n\r\nIt
    was digitized from The Headliners New York, Inc., a hand lettering artist company
    that also created a few phototype fonts, but went out of business pretty soon.\r\n\r\nIt
    was a style of hand lettering typically used for Cars advertising, in particular
    Pontiac cars, from 1955 to 1957, like this vintage ad:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pontiac_3449.png]"

    remains committed to keeping the community an inviting place for designers of
    all skill levels to learn, share tips, and promote the art of typeface design.
    Our policy is clear against making personal attacks on the forums; it's one of
    the few places where we feel the need to intervene and make our presence known,
    as the result on the community is detrimental to our mission.\r\n\r\nFor years,
    the Type ID board has been a place where community newcomers can get help on a
    font they've got their eye on. However, recently it has become a place where new
    posters get accused and verbally accosted for speculative crimes. This is unacceptable
    and injurious to the community at large. This is NOT what we are about.\r\n\r\nTo
    be succinct: <strong>cut it out</strong>. If you think a request is fishy, ignore
    it.\"\r\n</blockquote>"
