  it possible to rotate a specific page on a document your working?\r\nTo say i have
  10 pages, all are portrait(orientation) pages and i want one of these pages to be
  landscape orientated. Thus working with multiple orientation pages at the same time.\r\n\r\nIs
  this possible? if not what a handy trick to do it?"
