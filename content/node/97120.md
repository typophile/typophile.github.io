  quick test, the opentype PS is working flawlessly but the truetype is not giving
  me anything(the glyphs are not getting exported. It just shows me blanks and yeah
  the bitmap backgrounds are getting rendered). And while generating fonts nothing
  is happening when i am generating a truetype font but everything is fine if i am
  generating an opentype PS font. Any idea what ia happening. i am using FLS5 windows"

    errors in them too so I'm wondering how relevant/critical these errors are? I
    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant
    to others.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dinariraqi.com/\">Iraqi
