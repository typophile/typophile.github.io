body: I am looking at my travel plans and thinking about what I should do either pre
  or post Typecon. The Library at RIT ( Cary Graphic Arts Collection) looms large
  in my thinking. What else do you suggest in the vicinity? And a bit beyond. Thanks!

    typographic research. \r\nhttp://wally.rit.edu/cary/\r\nThe UB Poetry Collection
    has some amazing things as well including a complete run of Kelmscott books and
    other British private press works.\r\nhttp://ublib.buffalo.edu/pl/\r\nUB also
    has a large Polish collection which I have never looked through, but could prove
    useful for typographic research.\r\nhttp://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/asl/guides/polish-room/index.html\r\nThe
    Central Buffalo Library not too far from the conference hotel has a rare book
    room with some surprising things as well.\r\nhttp://milestones.buffalolib.org/main.htm\r\nAs
    with all special collections, it is best to make an appointment and if possible,
    state what you are looking for before you arrive. Browsing generally is not an
    option.\r\n\r\nWells College Book Arts center has summer institute sessions before
    and after (and during ...whoops) TypeCon\r\nhttp://www.wells.edu/bkarts/courses_2008.htm\r\n\r\nIf
    you are feeling Arts & Craftsy, you could spend a night before or after the conference
    at the Roycroft Inn in East Aurora \r\nhttp://roycroftinn.com/\r\nor in a Frank
    Lloyd Wright house in Buffalo\r\nhttp://www.thedavidsonhouse.com/\r\n"

  body: "Those were a few Typographic suggestions.\r\nFor other general interest diversions:
    Niagara Falls is 20 minutes from downtown Buffalo and the wine tours in the Niagara
    region of Ontario are plentiful. The TypeCon website will have more when it goes
    live."
