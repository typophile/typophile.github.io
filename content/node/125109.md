  a Type ID request in it. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong - I love a good challenge as
  much as the next Typophile, but I see all the Type ID requests getting in the way
  of more meaningful interactions. \r\n\r\nSeeing as Typophile has always been more
  democracy than dictatorship, what say you? Is it a problem, or should I just get
  over it?\r\n\r\nShall we draft a policy together on when and where it's appropriate?\r\n\r\nPlease!
  Weigh in, as this affects us all.\r\n\r\n//Jared\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    clutters the USP of Typophile. You could have the board on the site, but just
    don't let it show up in the normal feed. If you want to ID your type, just go
    to that board and you have focus only on that.\r\nPersonally I can do without
    a board like that. There are lots of them out there that do a good job. So why
    'also do Type ID'?"

    to tick a box saying \u201CThis is <strong>not</strong> a type ID request\u201D
    and if they <em>don\u2019t</em> tick it, it gets rerouted to the ID board and
    kept off the main feed! \r\nI assume it would be too complex a development task
    to have the capability to move a post to the ID board after it\u2019s posted?
    (I can imagine a scenario where if - say - three readers flag a post by hitting
    a certain link, it would automatically get kicked across...)\r\nWhat\u2019s almost
    as irritating is the perfunctoriness of many of them: they don\u2019t say please
    in the request and they rarely come back and say thanks when it\u2019s answered!

    believe that more than a policy, Typophile needs a different initial page. The
    main feed should focus on discussions and maybe just the last Type ID request
    could be shown \u2013 or none at all. Dave's idea is good and we need some restriction
    to avoid the forum to become mainly a Type ID tool and keep being the brilliant
    source of typographical information we know.\r\nBy the way, congratulations for
    the comeback. I am glad to see Typophile back."

  body: "It's certainly true that there a number of other good places to get type
    IDs. I've heard the argument that type IDs are a \"gateway drug\" :-) for more
    meaningful involvement in the wonderful world of type. In some cases that's true,
    but it's probably more often a way to end up with a pirated copy of the font...
    Some previous users weren't even shy about being \"collectors\", and willing to
    help people to that end. Watching this happen probably does more damage to meaningful
    participation than anything else.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the past IDs were moved
    to their own ghetto so the rest of us didn't have to watch. Personally I'd rather
    see the whole ID scene nixed from here, but I guess the ghetto is a decent compromise.
    The problem now is the Feed being infested with ID requests, which is inevitable.
    What I hope isn't inevitable is laxness in dealing with it. I suspect most people
    are simply not paying enough attention to not do that; they just need an alert,
    and directions to the ghetto. People who ignore a couple of warnings probably
    don't care about the integrity of Typophile, so they should be banned. Which BTW
    means no \"guest\" log-ins (at least not outside the Type ID section)."

    just want to never see the feed as a result.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the general look/feel/content
    is a turn-off. I'll stick with it for now out of love for what Typophile has been
    in the past. But I have to admit, TypeDrawers just seems far more functional right
    now."

  body: As excited as I was for the relaunch, I rarely visit. I was turned off by
    the feed-as-front page concept with its crazy stream of Type ID requests and "guests."
    Case in point, there is a Type ID request at the top of the feed right now that
    contains a huge image blowing all other content out of the water. When visiting
    the new Typophile, it's no longer evident there is great content or discussion
    to be had. I always valued the discussion forums and felt they built a great sense
    of community, but the front page as it stands is like a bad Twitter feed full
    of thoughtless people I didn't choose to follow.

  body: "As a typophile who is not a designer, my interest IS primarily the Font ID
    area, but as I do not get the site by RSS feed I did not realize that the ID stuff
    is 'clutter' to the rest of the community. The notion of being 'ghetto-ized' is
    perhaps an unfortunate use of the word, but I think separating the ID requests
    from other discussions makes sense. Frankly, the revived Type ID Board still seems
    struggling to find a format and a useful user interface. I think Stephen Coles
    ('Stewf') has done a nice job with his fontid.co site, and I had been helping
    there until I saw Typophile had been resurrected. Now I shuttle back and forth
    between the two sites. Typophile had an ID group that included many designers,
    but it seems that most of them have gone elsewhere, or are no longer interested
    in Font ID's. This is unfortunate, because as Hrant mentioned this site was a
    'gateway' for me to meet designers who were generous enough to help with the ID
    Guides on my bowfinprintworks.com web site. \r\n\r\nRather than dropping font
    ID, I would like to see it restored to something more like its earlier form. If
    it needs to be cut away from the other discussions that would be fine with me,
    especially if it had its own feed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    unfortunately. All you get is spam ID requests and huge headlines. And you can't
    use it with your phone. \r\nBut I think these are issues that can quite easily
    be taken care of. The first step would be to ditch the id request, at least from
    the feed. I'm not sure these request people would check a \"this is an id-request\"
    box, however. \r\nAlso, I think the input field on the intro page makes people
    write short, not that well thought-out stuff."
