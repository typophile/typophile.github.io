  sans fonts together. However, I would really like to use Helvetica as a companion
  font for a few different reasons listed below, and I was wondering is this something
  that is seen as a very bad thing?\r\n\r\n1. Using Helvetica for proposals and correspondance
  for word docs so that it is easily available on clients computers regardless of
  PC or Mac.\r\n\r\n2. It seems to look more modern and cleaner than a serif in these
  applications.\r\n\r\nAny feedback and or alternative suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nDemetre"

  body: "Thanks everyone for your comments. I guess this thread is another great example
    of why I feel confused quite oftenly when I'm trying to choose the correct typeface
    to accompany a typeface.  I realize that there isn't alway just one good answer.
    Such as, when using Futura ALWAYS use Gill Sans as a supporting typeface in all
    cases. \r\n\r\nI personally feel that using Futura for all of the text begins
    to look a bit monotone, drab and yet somehow over designed in some way. I also
    lean towards the sans typefaces as I feel they feel more modern and for the amount
    of text we use in real world applications from emails, proposals, contracts, etc.
    At the same time this I realize this is a personal preference and perhaps I am
    making typographical mistakes by choosing a sans to accompany the Futura family.
    However, I sometimes wonder if someone saying not to use Helvetica for body copy
    and someone else saying there is nothing wrong with Helvetica turns into a PC
    vs Mac debate in a way.\r\n\r\nAny more fuel you can add to the fire is greatly
    appreciated. In fact any resources anyone has related to typeface pairings would
    be a great help as well.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nDemetre\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, the Helvetica argument could seem a bit fanboyish, with neither side
    seeming to have a more valid claim, but to my understanding, there's some definite
    validity to the argument against using it for body text. The reason comes down
    to stroke contrast. If you look at typical serif text, the line that makes up
    each character changes in width (for example, look at an \"o\": the stroke will
    usually be thinner at the upper-left and lower-right or at the top and bottom).
    The problem with sans-serifs is that they are often monoline, meaning that they
    have very little stroke contrast. The lack of stroke contrast, plus the loss of
    serifs, which some consider to be useful for guiding the eye from letter to letter,
    is why many would recommend against using sans-serifs for extended text. You may
    see it a bit yourself if you print out an essay in a sans versus in a serif --
    I find that the sans version will tire me out more quickly.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    as James said, Helvetica can be terrific if used by someone who knows what they're
    doing (see the upcoming Helvetica movie for it's popularity). But when used by
    most, it runs the risk of seeming like it was just the default choice.\r\n\r\nSo,
    my suggestion: Don't use Helvetica, since it has little in common with Futura
    to suggest it as a strong companion and it is <em>not</em> on most PCs (they would
    have to use Arial -- blech!). If you're absolutely committed to using a sans other
    than Futura (which, I agree with Jackie, would be fine to use) try something more
    humanistic as Thomas suggested -- it will make for easier extended reading and
    will contrast with Futura (mechanical geometry vs. humanism). But to say that
    sans-serifs are simply more modern is not quite right, as there are tons upon
    tons of serifs that can feel incredibly contemporary. The problem is in finding
    something common to just about every PC: the only ones that are just about everywhere
    that I would use are Verdana, Georgia, and Trebuchet. Check them out, especially
    Georgia."

  body: "Hey Demetre, I agree with the other respondents here; Helvetica is a rotten
    accompaniment to Futura. If your second criteria is about 'more modern and cleaner'
    then why not keep it simple and use Futura for the whole lot, as Jackie says?\r\n\r\n<em>...any
    resources anyone has related to typeface pairings would be a great help as well</em>
    \r\nThere are a <a href=\"http://www.will-harris.com/fontpair-d-i.htm\">number
    of reference pages about type pairings</a> that Daniel Will-Harris put together
    years ago at his site www.will-harris.com. In that schema, the first suggested
    pairing for Futura is... Futura."

  body: "Ben - I wanted to email you - but your website doesn't offer a way to communicate
    with you. I found the font I made - the printer end was dated August of 1993.
    I think you'd get a kick out of it... It is the one I describe to you once before
    - for Berkley's Prime Crime imprint. (I don't think if fair of me to post it here
    for you :-)\r\n\r\nAnd wonderfulunion - may I suggest you take a closer look at
    Futura. Type is only bland, boring when not put together correctly. Futura has
    many weights and counterparts and various widths. It also, like Gill has a collection
    of \"Display\" fonts.\r\n\r\nI don't really think Gill is a grand alternative
    to Futura. If you are really looking for a counterpart - then why another san
    serif face? Soon onto Avant Garde, or make me smile with 20th Century - which
    is very futura-ish but in only 3 weights -- LOL\r\n\r\nWell, best of luck selecting
    - there are so many great ones out there to choose from."

    source, not the derivative.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bringhurst, not only can Futura

    form, and makes a good companion for Futura. I recommend ITC Bodoni, Berthold
    Bodoni Old Face or URW European Bodoni. Didot or Walbaum (Monotype Walbaum or
    Storm's Walbaum are the best choices here) are also good choices.\r\n\r\nAnother
    option is to choose a slab-serifed geometric font, such as Memphis, Beton or Rockwell.\r\n\r\nOther
    fonts from the Bauhaus and Art Deco eras are good options too, such as Erbar's
    Candida (an underrated and underused font) and Koch's Marathon (also highly underused
