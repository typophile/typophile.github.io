  It's not set in Gotham, I think, though it's pretty close.\r\n\r\nThe site's <a

  body: "Just confirming that this is definitely Avenir Demi. The lowercase \"a\"
    gives it away. (Tip: if you're trying to ID type in a flash movie, you can often
    use the context menu to zoom in to see more detail.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bumble_4066.gif]"

  body: "Mark, you killed it. One day I'll be as good as you (no hope in getting as
    good as Yves, though :) in IDing type. And great tip on that, SD. At that size,
    it does look like Avenir. I'm surprised that it looked 'humanist' on small sizes,
    even when set in all caps.\r\n\r\nPS. did I see an apostrophe in there :) ?"

  body: "Well, Avenir <em>was</em> Frutiger's humanist take on Futura.\r\n\r\nFrom
    Linotype:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Adrian Frutiger designed Avenir\u2122 in 1988, after
    years of having an interest in sans serif typefaces. In an  interview with Linotype,
    he said he felt an obligation to design a linear sans in the tradition of Erbar\u2122
    and Futura\xAE , but to also make use of the experience and stylistic developments
    of the twentieth century. The word Avenir means 'future' in French and hints that
    the typeface owes some of its interpretation to Futura. But unlike Futura\xAE
    , Avenir\u2122 is not purely geometric; it has vertical strokes that are thicker
    than the horizontals, an \"o\" that is not a perfect circle, and shortened ascenders.
    These nuances aid in legibility and give Avenir a harmonious and sensible appearance
    for both texts and headlines...\"</cite>"

  body: Well, some says that Avenir <em>is</em> a better Futura, so... I still think
    that it's more geometric than humanist in spirit, though. Well, okay, maybe it's
    more 'tough' and 'sturdy' rather than 'geometric' proper; but it's also warmer
    than, say, DIN.
