body: A couple of weeks ago I unsubscribed from the OT list at indx.co.uk to subscribe
  with another e-mail address but e-mails to subscribe-opentype are just bouncing
  back. The confirmation from the unsubscribe mail &#40;that one works...&#41; is
  stating that subscriptions should be sent to subscribe-members, but that one is
  obviously for another purpose. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have the e-mail address to the
  list owner? <BR> <BR>/m
