  computer a few weeks ago, and I thought I saved the font... \r\n\r\nI think it's
  a Roman Serif font: howver it has decoration to the letters. Hope somone can help.

  included an attachemtn so that you can download it if you need to.\r\nThanks !\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6348.png]"

  body: "I found it, and Yes it was a Trajan modification. oddly tho I odn't remember
    where I got it... I normally only buy fonts, try not to do free ones unless they
    are from google... so I wonder if it's been a older one since I started doing
    this anyway.... :)\r\n"

  body: 'My apologies Kirnath, I wasn''t accusing; just making an observation. This,
    at least to my eyes, clearly started out life as Trajan and was modified by adding
    the swash details.  Also, each letter was altered by changing or clipping one
    or more serifs as well as clipping the ascender on the ''N'' and extending the
    peak of the ''A''. While it might be presumptuous of me to say so, I think this
    was an attempt to avoid copyright infringements. '
