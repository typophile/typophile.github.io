  read Icelandic or Anglo-Saxon, I can't really tell if it's okay for an eth to have
  one.\r\n\r\nIs this an acceptable/good eth?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eth_5634.png]"

  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    GHD hair straighteners, <a href=\"http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to
    britney\u2019s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty,
    broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd\u2019s usually are not all
    that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage
    to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a
    couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard
    to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals
    Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get
    those ghd\u2019s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults
    include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P>"

  body: 'Thanks for the link, Kent, but I read that differently: not that an eth shouldn''t
    have a ball terminal, but that the ball on the eth in Archer is too heavy. And
    in the heavier weights of Archer, the ball does seem heavier than the bar. I don''t
    think that''s the case here.'

    contact info for Mr. Magn\xFAsson and ask for his comment on your specific design.
    So far, you don't seem to be having any luck attracting any Icelandic Typophiles
    to comment on this thread ;-)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "FWIW, I recently looked at eths in quite a stack of Faroese books to see
    what kinds of eths they like to use. Granted this was mostly text type, but the
    main question there seems to be how curved (&asymp; more traditional) or straight
    (&asymp; more current) the ascender is, and how to incorporate the crossbar. There
    seems to be quite a strong custom of leaving the top of the ascender weak, without
    a terminal; <a href=\"http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/2.1.4.eth.htm\">the approach
    proposed by Briem</a>, i.e. deducing the ascender from the parenthesis, suggests
    this too &ndash; although he says you can also use the numeral 9 as a starting
    point. \r\nSo, dunno, does your 9 have a ball? "

  body: "I'm Icelandic. It's a very readable eth and looks fine. However, ball terminals
    not being usual on eths it could strike some natives as a bit \"foreign,\" i.e.
    it does give away the fact that the typeface wasn't designed by someone who uses
    the language.\r\n\r\nTaking a look at the typeface's 9 and going from there is
    a good idea. But really, Icelanders being used to finding nothing, a ligature
    or, at best, a striked d, in the eth spot, this is great.\r\n\r\nIf you leave
    the terminal on I would suggest slanting the crossbar just a tiny bit more, though.\r\n\r\nAnd
    that OverKill eth looks hideous."
