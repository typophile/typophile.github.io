  body: It looks vaguely like a calligraphic version of some of the forms of Indian
    script. &#40;This is from looking at the non-Latin fonts at the tail end of the
    Font Book.&#41;. My best guess.

  body: I would guess that the top version is actually correct. This looks <i>vaguely</i>
    like some abstracted version of an Indian script &#40;I would hardly call it calligraphic&#41;.
    The two with a &#34;head line&#34; that I am familiar with are Devanagari &#40;used
    for Sanskrit, Hindi, and other languages&#41; and Bengali. But this is most definitely
    not either of those.  <BR> <BR>The third line seems out of place. <BR> <BR>Are
    you sure that it is an actual language/alphabet? Where did this sample come from?

    <BR>I found these might be the same language but not the same font. <BR>T
