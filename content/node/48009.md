body: "I'm trying to create an identity for my company, Manilla, but I'm having a
  hard time deciding what it should look like. I want the logo to represent that we
  are creative, fun and artistic (traditional arts). We try to use our own artwork
  in all the sites we do if the client is willing and if it fits. I've looked around
  for inspiration like on Logopond and Behance but I haven't found what I'm looking
  for.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mike Perry has a lot of great hand-drawn type http://www.midwestisbest.com/work.php\r\nThe
  question is, if I decide to use a hand-drawn logo will that look less professional?
  \r\n\r\nI attached some past <strong>mock-ups</strong>. The last one is what I'm
  trying to perfect. The L loops represent my sister and I and are also supposed to
  be a stylized M.\r\n\r\nbtw, hi Typophiles! (first post)\r\n\r\n"

    the samples you attached, you don't have to worry about that."

  body: "well, you have to admit that david has a point. the type does not, in and
    of itself, communicate what the public might wanna know about manilla. sometimes
    that's okay. \"TARGET\" does not convey \"retail store\" but it's a very successful
    logo.\r\nbut sometimes, it's not okay. if it's not an established brand, a logo
    that really tells us what to expect can be very helpful.\r\n\r\nthe bigger question
    is, are hand-drawn logos less professional, and the answer is no -- not if they're
    done with professionalism. or, yes -- if they're not."

  body: "Thanks for the post ChuckGroth. I understand what David means. A lot of logotypes
    depend on a logo to help establish the brand. Although, I haven't seen that many
    web agency logos with web related graphics. It's too predictable.\r\n\r\nSince
    manilla uses custom artwork on sites I want the logo to look \"artsy\". I will
    post some hand-drawn logos this week. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, since I'm going to use
    the swoop logo, does anyone have any critiquing to give on: if the two l's look
    like an 'M' to you/ if the swoops are too big/too small.. etc?\r\n\r\nThanks "

    l\u2019s are becoming too knot-like and less spontaneous maybe a greater variation

    looks like it was done in illustrator. Have you tried pen & ink? (sorry, not intended
    to be an advertisement for my name) Right now it's looking a little cartoony to
    me rather than 'artsy'.\r\n\r\nI think actually hand drawing this would give you
    more of an authentic, artsy feel."

  body: Without penn's comment, I had no idea what aluminum was talking about! But
    then again, I'm not from the US. Nor do I work in "office cubicle land". Manilla
    sounds exotic to me also (capital of the Philippines) and the loops are quite
    nice. My favorite is the last option you presented (with shorter lines perhaps).

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Manilla_hand_drawn_5150.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    attached some more logo ideas. I really can't pinpoint which direction I want
    to go in. Why am I treating this identity like it's for Nike lol? \r\n\r\nAnyways,
    to answer some of your questions:\r\n\r\nYes, Manilla is a creative agency and
    yes we're US based. We chose the name for a couple of reasons: \r\n\r\nAluminum
    is half right on one of them. It does represent the plain, generic office cubicle-land.
    But to me it more so representative of the manila paper I drew on as kid. Creativity
    was welcome and free to express.\r\n\r\nIt's an inside joke. I'm half asian, so
    if you take a yellow asian man and mix it with a white caucasian man what do you
    get? Bad joke.\r\n\r\nThe two L's in manilla stand for my sister and I -- it's
    our company. Having the L's connected can represent our brother-sister relationship.\r\n\r\nIt
    sounds fun to say! We wanted a name that didn't make us <em>seem</em> like geeks
    i.e Hyper Revolution Media or Digitalistic Realm Design.\r\n\r\nAluminum, since
    you said it reminds of of the corporate world that makes it even more important
    for us to show in the identity that we're completely opposite of \"cubicle land\".
    That's why I feel a hand-drawn/\"artsy\" logo will hopefully get the message across.\r\n\r\nAs
    of now, I'm leaning towards the bottom ones. Unfortunately, it takes the emphasis
    away from the L's but I feel it's more fitting. As you can see in the top right,
    it looks funky mixing computer fonts with hand drawn letters in the same word.
    Well, at least the way I'm doing it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you all think? BTW, these
    are all roughs and the bottoms ones aren't supposed to be on a baseline."
