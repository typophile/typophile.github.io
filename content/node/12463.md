body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Italic</strong>\r\n\r\nItalic is another
  style of letter, akin to [[Roman]], but with a more humanist nature. \r\n\r\nItalic
  is not the opposite of Roman, though. It is the opposite of [[Oblique]]. Oblique
  styles may also be called Sloped Roman, and they are mostly the same letterforms
  found in a Roman face, with a mechanical slant applied (See [[Oblique]]). \"True\"
  Italic letterforms have been drawn so that they are more formally differentiated
  from upright [[Roman]] letters, the inclination or \"cursiveness\" ([[Cursive]])
  is natural to Italics, as it has been conserved from its origins (See [[Aldus Manutius]]).\r\n\r\nAlso
  some formal aspects such as the particular glyphs used to represent letters are
  characteristic of Italics. The lowercase \"a\" for instance, is not the humanist
  lowercase \"a\" (As in Helvetica), but the much more rounded \"a\" similiar to the
  one seen in Avant Garde for example. Another character that makes Italics easy to
  distinguish is the lowercase \"f\" which extends below the baseline.\r\n\r\nBoth
  Oblique and Italic are used for similar proposes within texts, sometimes for emphasizing
  or to make a citation evident, even though whole texts can be writing in Obliques
  or Italics. Fonts may include Obliques or Italics, [[Adrian Frutiger]]'s [[Frutiger]]
  uses obliques but [[Frutiger Next]] has Italics, for example.\r\nIn the last years
  more and more attention is being put unto this difference, and fonts with Italics
  are gaining value for their aesthetic gain (seen as positive diversity).\r\nThe
  new Sans bundled with Windows Vista for example, have all specially designed Italics.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
