  typefaces. Think of the Van Krimpen hyphen, and of course height-adjusted parens,
  middots, endash and emdash (with hopes of making cap-specific tabular numerals too
  \u2014 one day!). Question is, how do I go about naming them? hyphen.alt is too
  vague and might clash at some point. hyphen.caps? I was looking for examples, but
  after ten minutes in the Adobe specification site, I threw in the towel. Is there
  a convention?\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n<em>Edited title to reflect proper nomenclature;
  post left intact to keep the thread sensible.</em>"

    \xBBcase\xAB? There is not really a convention, but it is convenient to use the
    feature tag as glyph name suffix, e.g. hyphen.case."

  body: "Ah, my bad, you're right. I have it called \u201Ccase\u201D in the feature
    file, but forgot to use my brain while typing this post. hyphen.case sounds reasonable
    and not vulnerable to confusion, so I'm going with that."
