body: this is my first attempt in using illustrator and i have to create an identity
  for a non-profitable organisation &#34;Acres For Elephants&#34;. this is what i&#39;ve
  come up with and the &#34;a&#34; seems so out of place. i&#39;m not a graphic-background
  student but i&#39;m trying my best in my new multimedia course. any suggestions
  to improve the logo or a new typeface is greatly appreciated. thanks in advance!

  body: 'I love the idea of making portions of the elephant out of the acronym. I
    respectfully disagree with Mr. Weaver, however, and I think that the &#34;a&#34;
    and &#34;e&#34; are necessary, and with a more effective integration would make
    this mark wonderfully unique. I do believe in KISS, but I think it can be applied
    here to the silhouette instead of removing a great layer of meaning.  <BR> <BR>I
    see the &#34;e&#34; in 1,2,3,5,6 as an ear, and see that with a different perspective,
    like a 3/4 view, that there may be potential to work the &#34;a&#34; in a similar
    way, on the other side of the elephant&#39;s head.  <BR> <BR>For that matter the
    logo could be a lot more about the head and less about the whole body, I would
    consider further exploration within this main concept area. <BR> <BR>I do like
    #4 for it&#39;s blend of contemporary and muted colors.  <BR> <BR>Aaron'

  body: hello Aaron, i was trying to fit the &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39; because the
    organisation is Acres For Elephant, however, the &#39;a&#39; just seems to stick
    out like a sore thumb. could you elaborate a little more on the 3/4 view?

  body: I agree with Aaron -- it doesn&#39;t make sense to me that the &#34;f&#34;
    is incorporated into the logo mark but the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;e&#34; float free.
    If the &#34;f&#34; is the face and trunk of the elephant, perhaps the &#34;a&#34;
    and &#34;e&#34; can be tiny elephant eyes or ears?
