body: "I'm playing with TTX/Fonttools and I'm trying to accomplish to get zero height
  and zero width chars:\r\n\r\nABC\r\nDEF\r\n\r\nAll these six chars should be on
  the same spot (where the A is) and overlap eachother. This includes the chars on
  the second line.\r\n\r\nI got the glyps to overlap horizontally by setting the width
  to 0 in the HMTX table.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to set zero height as well? I read
  about the VMTX table but it looks like its only used for vertical fonts. Can you
  set zero height a different way? An line height of 0 for the entire font, instead
  of setting it for each character, would work as well.\r\n\r\nAnd my zero width chars
  only appear when I prepend with a normal width character. Say I have A, B and C
  of 0 width, then\r\n\r\nABC\r\n\r\nwill be invisible, and\r\n\r\nXABC\r\n\r\nwill
  show an X and then the A, B and C overlapping eachtoher. Is there any way to get
  zero width chars to show without prepending them with a normal width char?\r\n"

    7.\r\n\r\nWhen pushing the limits, do be aware each rasterizer has its own limits.
    ABC shows just fine in Windows and Firefox."

  body: "Chrome on Windows 7 and Chromium on Linux Mint will only show overlapped
    ABC when it's prepended by a normal width char. But Firefox on Windows 7 indeed
    shows the overlapped ABC without any extra chars. Good to learn about this difference.\r\n\r\nI've
    converted my TTF to a TTX XML file. How can I start playing with the line height?
    I don't see any values that seem to represent it."

  body: "Just in case anyone else ever wants to do this and finds this thread:\r\n\r\nI
    got chars to overlap properly by giving the first char (A)  a width of 512 and
    a left side bearing of 0. All the following chars (B and C) have a width of 0,
    and a lsb of -512. I can do this because I know I'll always start with the A \u2014
    I don't know how you can do this reliably cross-browser if the order is unknown.\r\n\r\nI'm
    still looking into the line-height thing, but it seems that both Apple and Microsoft
    have different approaches to calculate this from the font's properties. A font's
    height could be based on the bounding box measurements, the ascender/descender
    values, or other values in the OS2 table. My conclusion is that if you want to
    tweak the (line-) height of a font, do it in CSS."
