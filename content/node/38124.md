  body: Car brand logos are more often than not custom designed. I'm pretty sure this

  body: yep... definitely custom... when i did work for mitsubishi, they have their
    own (not very imaginative) fonts. The logo lettering is reminiscent of Avante
    Garde, but like many Japanese manufacturer's logos, it has probably gone through
    a number of re-drawings to get to this point.
