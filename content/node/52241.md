  body: "Ehm -- no.\r\n\r\nShift + Return = Soft return, invokes the blight of forced
    justification upon your paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIt's the Enter key at the side of your
    numeric pad. It's called \"Enter\" to discern it from \"Return\", as there were
    days those keys were clearly marked that way.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you don't
    like that key -- perhaps you are working on a laptop? --, you can always select
    your own, under Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Endless browsing throught the drop
    lists until you find \"Column break\". If you cannot locate it, you can click
    \"Show Set\". This will create a simple text edit file with all possible commands
    and its associated keystrokes, and there you can use search to find the category
    \"Column Break\" falls under."
