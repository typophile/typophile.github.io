  caps rendering of Helvetica? Same goes for Arial.\r\n\r\nI've got a copy of TypeTool
  and I'm thinking about doing this as a fun project in my spare time. But no point
  in doing it if it's already been done.\r\n\r\n(FWIW, fake small caps are one of
  my biggest typographic pet peeves. What annoys me the most is that Microsoft includes
  real small caps in all of their new ClearType fonts, yet Office still uses fake
  small caps with these fonts.)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kpao.org/blog/2008/07/microsoft-office-generated-small-caps-evil.html\r\nhttp://www.kpao.org/blog/2008/07/small-caps-versions-common-web-fonts.html\r\n"

  body: "Dan Reynolds seems to [[http://typophile.com/node/39318|remember]] an obsolete
    GX (read: pre-OS X QuickDraw) version of Helvetica with small caps. From that
    link you can get a sense of similar fonts \u2013 even a convincing imitation with
    small caps, but otherwise incompatible with Helvetica/Helvetica Neue. Nothing
    to my knowledge is currently available, let alone installable, like a true Helvetica
    SC.\r\n\r\nYou may not be the first to do it, but hey, every revival has its share
    of ardent fans ;-)"
