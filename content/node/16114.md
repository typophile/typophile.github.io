body: "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch (newspaper) recently went through a redesign. It
  felt uncomfortable to me from the start, and the more I thought about it, I believe
  it's because they chose <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/amplitude/\">
  Amplitude </a> for the headline/display face. This choice seems very inappropriate
  to me, and I was wondering if anyone else had a thought about the face.\r\nExamining
  the letters, you can see that crotches and apexes are heavily notched, which I take
  as an attempt to keep them from \"closing up\" at text settings. This works well
  when you're using a face like this at 12pt or below, but strikes me as clumsy and
  out of place as a display face.\r\n\r\nAnyone else out there using Amplitude? Other
  thoughts on the subject?\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newsdesigner.com/archives/002255.php"

  body: Sure, it's a tad unusual, but I don't find Amplitude clumsy at all. At large
    sizes the ink traps serve as the distinctive feature of a headline face. The general
    structure of Amp is so sound, it works just fine. It's been used to great effect
    as a headliner in many magazines over the last few years, but it's wonderful to
    see it in a newspaper. Completely livens it up.

  body: That's an interesting view. But to my eye, especially at 72pt and above, those
    ink traps look like someone went at it with an x-acto. Like I said, they are really
    functional at text sizes, but strike me as awkward.

    Look at the great newspaper men -- Hearst, Pulitzer, etc... these guys had OPINIONS

    was necessary and responsible. A problem today is that newspapers are so afraid

    that doesn't mean that it's ever possible to shed a point of view completely.
    The only way to persue that calling journalistically speaking is to admit that
    you have a point of view & own it. Typographically speaking even Helvetica ( or
    Ariel ) or really pick any typeface you think is 'Neutral' has a history,cultural
    associations and most of all assumptions built into it. \r\n\r\nI am not giving
    a US neo-con style license to shirk duty here a la Fox news. Instead I am saying
    there is a more precise kind of duty. Admitting imperfection doesn't imply a license
    to go wild. \r\n\r\nBut to keep the post semi relevant - I have to admit that
    while I agree with Chuck about Amplitude being maybe a bit beyond where news headlines
    are concerned. On the other hand Tif's point about making the paper more hip might
    be a good one too. Certainly the headlines will grab the eye more than they would
    with some other face. But it might hurt the eyes after a while.\r\n\r\nOddly her
    idea that Amplitude is hip, seems in total contrast to her statement  \"I\u2019m
    not so sure that the use of Amplitude implies anything.\"  I can't agree with
    that idea. A face like that definitely means more than the average news/headline
    face. It has too much flavor to not mean anything. Tif, what did you mean when
    you said this?"

    over time. After all in 1450 the most 'neutral' face in Germany would have been
    a textura - no? To me that suggests that what we mean by 'neutral' is something
    beyond what seems to be aesthetically implied by the term. Or a set of something
    else/s.\r\n\r\nI think what are referring to when we say neutral is a combination
    of ubiquity or lack of cultural novelty which is a question of use, a typicality
    of glyph shapes which is a question of form & finally (maybe) visual simplicity
    in the design of the gyphs themselves. I think that their importance is really
    in that order. When David is saying Pizzaz, I wonder which of these three he means.
    \r\n\r\nWhat I am not convinced of is whether seeking a 'neutral' face is a goal
    worth having at per se since to my mind the idea of 'neutrality' obscures as much
    as it reveals.  \r\n\r\nMaybe thinking about the character and associations of
    the face is better, along with it's history, it's technical qualities, it's fit
    with the length of text and so on. All of which is a way to consider a face's
    fit with the intent. Rather than say 'Neutral' perhaps we should say we don't
    want to draw attentiuon to the face or something more specific or precise.\r\n\r\n>

    and Univers, was described as being neutral.  At the time (50's-60s) perhaps it
    was so to some degree. Today, we look back and affix the dreaded \"Modernist\"
    label to it. Times Roman kinda sorta was for a while but got the DTP label. It
    may be more possible to assume only temporary neutrality status to a face. Several
    years back, their were very few choices in type and the \"standard\" faces got
    used because that is what the printer had. There was no intent to make the typeface
    the carrier of the message beyond readability. Readers didn't read anything into
    a face on a cognitive level. Readers accepted type as just \"normal\" and therefore
    not meant to convey. Newspaper headlines for the \"Attack on Pearl Harbor\", \"Marilyn
    Marries DiMaggio\", or \"Yankees Win World Series\" were all set in the same type.
    There was no purposive attempt to color the message with the type.  To that end,
    we could say the type was neutral.  Today, we look back at those same vintage
    headlines and perhaps see \"Old News Style\" or some such label.\r\nToday, there
    are so many type choices and you can search them and purchase them instantly.
    \ There is no such thing as \"This is what the printer had mats for.\" We SEE
    many more types in use and EXPECT to see meaning hinted at by choice of font.
    There is no time for a type to become \"normal\" because it is replaced by the
    next one so soon.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
