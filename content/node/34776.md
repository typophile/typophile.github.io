  want to make a OpenType-script for [[swash]] characters. One script for \r\nbeginning
  characters, and one for the last.\r\nBut whatever I do, not only the beginning character
  are changed, but also \r\nother Uppercase-letters inside the text-string....\r\nWhat's
  going wrong??\r\n\r\nBest regards and thanks for your help,\r\nMorten\r\n"

    works perfect...please look at the attached screenshot.\r\nOf course, the must
    be a reason, but I can't see it. After the 'A', the Uppercase looks right,\r\nbut
    'PH' should only the P be a swash!   \r\n\r\nMorten\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_4310.jpg]"

  body: "Morten, \r\n\r\n1. Your @call class should include all text glyphs, not just
    the plain uppercase and lowercase letters. \r\n\r\n2. You might consider adding
    simple-substitution \"init\" and \"fina\" features into your font. The \"init\"
    would substitute regular letters with their initial forms, and \"fina\" would
    do the same for the final forms. These features are supported now (on user's discretion)
    in InDesign CS3. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
