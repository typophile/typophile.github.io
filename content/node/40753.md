body: "I'm looking for a new slab serif that has some extremely thin weights and some
  heavier weights for a headline font. Are there any good new ones floating around
  now that have not been used to bits? \r\n\r\nIts for a mens magazine, so I am looking
  for something that doesn't feel dainty. Ideally I'm looking for something geometric.
  I've included two samples of one treatment I'd use with the font, making a stencil
  out of it. Would greatly appreciate any suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nnick"
