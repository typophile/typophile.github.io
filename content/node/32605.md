body: "Hi\r\nI'm looking for a Dingbat to work with Joshua Dardens Freight Display.
  So, a classic style with different nice arrows, symbols. The use is for a Scandinavian
  cultural magazine (high brow) if that helps narrow it down. \r\nA fast glance at
  fontshop didn't really help me out... :( Type Embellishments and Arabesque & Rococo
  Ornaments are to the right direction but not quite it. \r\nThanks. "

    to see there!\r\nI personally like Nat Vignette a lot (I even had one character
    tattooed last year).\r\n\r\nThere's also a free font with different styles & characters
    from other ornamental fonts called WebOMints which you can find here http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/webomints/"
