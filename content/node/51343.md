  show' to the bank. their pampered fat asses shit stuff better than i eat.\r\ni love
  you all so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              where is the land
  of the freaks, home of bravado?\r\n\r\n                              why does it
  have to be a convention that unbinds \r\n                              hands, wardrobes,
  tongues, minds...\r\n\r\n                              i do indeed feel that there
  was a 'westward ho' \r\n                              sort of thing which happened
  over the past two \r\n                              decades. i know a lot of ex-new
  yorkers, \r\n                              chicagoans, southerners in washington
  myself. \r\n\r\n                              but once they ended up here, a good
  chunk of life \r\n                              later, what have they found?\r\n\r\n
  \                             a little bit of security, but not enough to \r\n                              sidestep
  a centimeter of the rat race. \r\n\r\n                              a million cheques
  to write each month, most of \r\n                              them to safeco subsidiaries.\r\n\r\n
  \                             grey dismal skies most of the time, nowhere to \r\n
  \                             actually swim.\r\n\r\n                              sullen
  nordic neighbors with loaded guns and \r\n                              opinions.\r\n\r\n
  \                             statewide laws and mores which reflect the \r\n                              standards
  of only one affluent, conservative \r\n                              community.\r\n\r\n
  \                             'intellectuals' and artists who rely more on \r\n
  \                             social networking and externalia to cement their \r\n
  \                             self esteem in everyone's rolodex.\r\n\r\n                              an
  inflated sense of 'city esteem' grossly \r\n                              disproportionate
  to achievement and culture. \r\n\r\n                             this is a small
  town by any metropolitan standards.\r\n\r\n                              you can't
  take a trot downtown without dozens of \r\n                              familiar
  faces. \r\n\r\n                              downtown? a few blocks...\r\n\r\n                              the
  sheer anonymity of rio & bombay, even for a \r\n                              white
  man is a heady, heady thing\r\n\r\n                              yes it's not all
  that bad, the buds are good...\r\n                              but that may just
  be the problem.\r\n\r\n                              everybody i know is chemically
  numb - or retreats \r\n                              to that numbness. i mean everybody.
  mood-control \r\n                              pills are no different from alcoholism
  or chronic \r\n                              masturbation. \r\n\r\n                              i
  don't believe in temperance, not a whit.\r\n                              but when
  you're high just to cope, just to get by, \r\n                              something's
  wrong. \r\n\r\n                              when you're afraid to cross the street
  against the \r\n                              light for fear of a jaywalking ticket,
  it's time \r\n                              to move to budapest. what an irony.\r\n\r\n
  \                             look at our recent 'riots'\r\n                              cause
  in the main by a bunch of dork nazi police \r\n                              who
  just wanted try out their equipment and \r\n                              methods.
  zero awareness of the interactivity of \r\n                              social
  equations.\r\n\r\n                              nothing of the sort could ever have
  happened \r\n                              in -------- i wont name names because
  that becomes \r\n                              another pecker contest. lets just
  say that there \r\n                              are, even in amerika, places where
  amiable \r\n                              authorities and generally fun-loving citizens
  meet \r\n                              in the street without tear gas.\r\n\r\n                              \"you
  don't like it? leave!\" says mr. larson\r\n\r\n                              i shall,
  and many like me, this will once again be \r\n                              the
  land of larson and robocop. \r\n\r\n                              thy grim legislature
  can continue to pass laws \r\n                              about passing laws.
  modified versions of the \r\n                              'pledge of allegiance,'
  amended to include \r\n                              employer, insurance agent,
  and immediate superior, \r\n                              will be recited at each
  place of employ.\r\n\r\n                              the television shows about
  prison life will start \r\n                              soon. social engineering
  - to get everyone used to \r\n                              the fact that in 20
  years, at the current rates of \r\n                              incarceration,
  25% of americans will be or have \r\n                              been in jail
  - for crimes varying from selling \r\n                              crystals of
  certain frequencies to possession of \r\n                              naturally
  occurring weeds which grow almost \r\n                              anywhere, peeing
  behind a dumpster, having an old \r\n                              beer can with
  half an inch of liquid in it in the \r\n                              back seat
  &&&\r\n\r\n                              it is a small cold grey place. the reins
  of power \r\n                              are held by small cold grey people.\r\n\r\n
  \                             the pockets of respite, of intensity are just that
  \r\n                              - pockets. rebellion is intrinsically \r\n                              self-destructive
  or miraculously grows older, and \r\n                              then sells out.
  and in these very small \r\n                              sub-communities, nobody
  looks around. the us and \r\n                              them game is perhaps
  a little too scary.\r\n\r\n                              maybe i'm just upset because
  i missed the big fun \r\n                              party. i didn't get to trot
  out my silky mages \r\n                              robes, my snow-leopard cloak
  or cartaphilus' \r\n                              leather apron and 10 ad roman
