body: "There are so many lawn services. Please help me make this one a truly unique
  and well done logo. \r\n\r\nNeltner's lawn service is not a lawn mowing business
  but they do other up keep such as chemical spraying for greener lawns as described
  in my logo.\r\n\r\nSo far I have worked off of Optima Italic to design the word
  \"Neltner's\", and have used Myriad Pro for the words, \"LAWN SERVICE\".\r\n\r\nI
  want to learn from you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Neltner's-lawn-service---Logo_4364.gif]"

  body: 'I would think the water nozzle could be a part of the l instead. It seems
    forced as part of the N as it stands. The swash off of the N seems forced as well.
    You could more easily extend the s to work and fill that gap if that is what you
    needed. The N is too heavy in comparison as well. '

  body: I like your concept and the freshness of the logo. The nozzle looks awkward
    attached to the N. Try it with some other fonts, also I think Miss Tiffany made
    a good suggestion. Watch your kerning "Ne" and "ner' " look too close. To me,
    the swoosh underneath is extraneous. Zebiz's slightly darker green for "lawn service"
    is much easier to read. Great start, keep it up.

  body: "I think the nozzle itself is forced. \r\ni would instead suggest loosing
    the underline (the words LAWN SERVICE do that anyway) and just alluding to the
    \ nozzle by having the spray emit from either the right leg of the 'N' or the
    'l.'"

  body: '#4 looks good, although as mentioned before the spray gun doesn''t really
    work.  How about making the "l" a sprinkler shape?'

  body: "If you really want to use the nozzle you need to reconsider the l altogether.
    This will lead you to reconsider the typeface choice. The l shouldn't be an l
    with a nozzle on the end of it. It should be a hose of somekind, no? \r\n\r\nI'd
    not worry about how or where you place \"Lawn Service\" until you solve \"Neltner's\"."

  body: Perhaps the final s is the place for this nozzle and hose? An s hosepipe might
    extend under the rest of the name a lot better than your original N.

  body: "First, I wouldn't use an oblique typeface. I'm also not sure if Optima works.\r\n\r\nTry
    setting \"Neltner's\" in a sans face, with a blue, teardrop-shaped apostrophe
    that looks like it's coming out of the 'r'. That might be all you need - no hose,
    no nozzle, no grass. If it works, it would be much subtler than what you've got
    going on right now.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    I will be showing him D1 for sure. What, in your opinion is my strongest of the
    chemical spray?\r\n"

    thing looks a bit amateurish - clip art comes to mind; I should prefer a company
    with a professional appeal.

  body: "D is your strongest concept. I do agree however that the font has a strong
    retro feel, very 1970's. \r\n\r\nAs for the spray versions, don't go with any
    from the C series (2 of them look like Nejtner's). Normally I'm not a big Optima
    fan, but of your design's I like the ones using that font best. It looks organic,
    simple, grass like (hate the apostrophe though). The nozzle issue has never been
    resolved. Since you client specifically asked for a spray version, I believe B
    is the strongest."

    very well. If you switched it up for something more polished, such as Antenna
    (Font Bureau) or Parisine (Porchez Typofonderie) and focused on the conept of
    the water drop it would be much stronger."
