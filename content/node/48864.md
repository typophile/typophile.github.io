  body: "I would de-activate the font in Suitcase and test the font in the system
    directly. Place the font files in /Users/<your username>/Library/Fonts/. Run a
    font utility like Font Nuke and restart your system. Then test to see if it still
    fails. \r\n\r\nFont Nuke\r\nhttp://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/29757\r\n\r\nI've
    encountered a couple of old Mac font-suitcase based TrueType fonts that seem to
    not work in Word 2008. I can tell this is an application-level issue (in my case)
    because the fonts appear in other applications. I think TextEdit.app is a useful
    baseline application to determine if Mac OS has the font active. You might also
    want to test the fonts with FontBook's Validate Font File feature. \r\n\r\nIf
    this is a font that you have licensed, you should consider contacting the vendor.
    They probably have a better chance at determining whether this is a problem with
    the font itself or the application. They may also be able to recommend a workaround. "

  body: "I recently posted a similar problem with Word 2008. After doing a LOT of
    research, the conclusion seems to be this is a known bug in Office 2008, and the
    MS people do not seem terribly concerned with fixing it. The problem is NOT with
    your font, so don't bother your font vendor, your problem will not get solved.
    The Word/Office 2008 font menu problem is not a function of format either--it
    occurs with T1, TT and OTF fonts.\r\n\r\nIf you know the actual filename of the
    font, you CAN still access it in Word. Using the listbox in the formatting palette,
    type the entire font file name, hit return, and bingo--it will apply the font
    to the text you have selected in your document. For example, if you have the T1
    font \"XYZ Medium Italic\" on your system, with postscript file name \"XYZ-MediumItalic\",
    type that in the listbox and it will work, even though it does not show up in
    Word's font menu.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the font menu won't remember this trick,
    so if you need to repeatedly apply this font, either (a) put the cursor in a text
    block where you have already applied the font, do a copy:format, and then do a
    paste:format to the new text where you wish the \"invisible\" font to be applied,
    or (b) create a style in Word with the affected font, give it a name and save
    it, and then apply that style whenever you wish to use the invisible font.\r\n\r\nA
    real pain in the arse, but this IS Microsoft we're talking about.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wrong. Not fixed. Not even with the latest 12.1.2 update. MS is aware that
    the problem still exists. From what I gathered, the issue above only \"solved\"
    Microsoft's coding errors with OT fonts in font menus, and even then it only \"fixed\"
    families where the base weight name is \"Roman\" instead of \"Regular\".\r\n\r\nMS
    really seems to be purposefully sabotaging its Mac applications software, a real
    shame given the long history between the two companies. Surely they realize they're
    going to lose their Mac side customer base with this type of behavior, right?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>MS really seems to be purposefully sabotaging its Mac applications
    software...</cite>\r\n\r\nHonestly...I don't think so. MS is profit driven just
    like any other company. If they really wanted to undermine Mac users they would
    stop investing in Mac app development and embargo our side of the world. It is
    simply a bug that they still have to squash.\r\n\r\nI experienced it recently
    as well. I'm developing a family of fonts. I found that with the Demi and Demi
    Italic faces loaded Word displayed Demi in the font menu but not Demi Italic.
    (I felt like I'd stepped into Windows for a second, since that is the norm there.)
    If I typed Demi Italic into the listbox in the formatting palette (as ryanholmes
    suggested) I could access it just fine, but I could never access it without manually
    typing it in. I edited my font changing only the name from Myfont Demi and Demi
    Italic to Myfont Medium and Medium Italic. It now shows up properly in Word's
    font menu. "

    is Word installed in the Applications folder of your boot drive? I keep it installed
    in a \"Programs\" volume and the updater won't recognize it unless it's in the
    Applications folder. You can simply copy your installed copy there, update, then
    move it back to where you normally keep it.\r\n\r\nIf that isn't the situation,
    sorry, that's the only work-around that popped into my head."
