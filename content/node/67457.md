  and would appreciate any opinions on the ID.  I'm new to the nuances of fonts, but
  did try many different identifying techniques to find it, to no avail.\r\n\r\n   Also,
  any suggestions on good font blogs following new and quality font releases?  Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Blogs_5718.jpg]"
