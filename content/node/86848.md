  I hope to get into type creation in the future.\r\nI have one small, potentially
  big problem though: The type creation tools i know about (typographer, typelab)
  are too expensive for myself, being a student.\r\n\r\nAre there any other programs
  out there for a beginner (as i've never used a program like this before, it was
  all by hand), but one that is as close to industry standard as possible? One that
  is cheap/free, robust, and for mac os x.\r\n\r\nAlso, how would one advise me on
  getting started, i mean, really getting started, in typography? I've been drawing
  fonts and stuff forever, and i'm making editorial layouts and posters for school,
  but other than that, i have little to no experience.\r\n\r\nANY help would be appreciated.
  Thanks in advance."

    and qualifies you for a discount if you want to move up to FontLab."
