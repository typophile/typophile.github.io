    own field. I\u2019ve also seen this capitalization-for-no-apparant-reason in churches.
    Guess it\u2019s just a human thing :)"

  body: "Re: caps use... I see this so often in the interaction between our typesetters
    and authors. The author submits a manuscript using just initials (say, LCD in
    your example above). The setters send out a proof, with a query next to it, asking
    \u201Cplease spell out \u2018LCD\u2019\u201D (OK, probably not a good example
    \u2019cause everybody knows what that stands for, but it\u2019s only a f\u2019rinstance).
    The author answers \u201CLiquid Crystal Display\u201D, using initial caps almost
    without thinking, because the caps of the acronym are in mind. And then the corrected
    proof ends up saying \u201CLiquid Crystal Display (LCD)\u201D. In most cases,
    if I spot it, I get rid of those initial caps!"

  body: "I have to say, I personally think SC in this case look pretty twee. I don\u2019t
    know why people are always so anxious to replace every string of capitals with
    SC. If you think caps are causing dark spots on the page, just open them up a
    hair.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s my opinion.\r\n\r\n(Is your client going to be having
    someone copy-edit and proof this copy?)"

  body: "The typographic conventions that evolved for small cap usage did so long
    ago. At that time, text was serifed, small x-height, had no kerning, and capitals
    were considerably heavier, in stem weight, than lower case. Even so, small capitals
    were often further distinguished by being letterspaced.\r\n\r\nTherefore, small
    caps are inherently problematic for almost all sans face text usage, especially
    for short acronyms.\r\n\r\nThat is why, if one is intent on using sans small caps
    in running text, one should consider faces which have small x-heights and small
    caps that are markedly taller than x-height.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gothic_4323.png]"

    the SC in there look rather too small. In this situation I'd just use caps.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Woops, crossposted. Sorry."

  body: "I've personally grown to love the look/feel of SC for acronyms.\r\n\r\nWas
    just surfing around for other opinions when I chanced upon this:\r\n\r\n<cite>Using
    some kind of typographic marker for an acronym might be useful if enough people
    knew what it meant. But as fewer and fewer publications observe the convention,
    fewer readers know what it signals, and thus the small caps look more and more
    like a mistake. Newspapers don\u2019t set acronyms differently, of course \u2014
    they barely use italics. And I\u2019ve seen some books and magazines use a point
    size somewhere between small caps and full caps, which makes me wonder why they
    even bother making a distinction. Surely that would look even more like a mistake?\r\n\r\n<cite>I\u2019ll
    put the question to you: What would the value be of continuing to set acronyms
    in small caps, when few readers know what the convention means and it makes acronyms
    look so odd on a page (especially in articles that are peppered with both acronyms
    and initialisms)?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.copyediting.com/wordpress/?p=310\r\n<cite>\r\n\r\nNever
    occurred to me to treat acronyms and initialisms differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Small caps are/should be designed to solve a problem: Capital letters grab
    to much attention because they are so big and slightly heavier than the lowercase
    \u2014 they are designed to signal the start of a sentence. In a cap heavy language
    like German, a set of mid caps will not grab as much attention in mid-sentence.
    It\u2019s not the mid caps that look like an error, it\u2019s the FULL CAPS in
    mid-sentence.\r\n\r\nIf the small caps are well done they\u2019ll blend in. Unfortunately
    many type designers draw them too low (I\u2019m guilty here, but it\u2019s mostly
    due to screen rendering), too light and heavily tracked which make them stand
    out and thus not preform well at their task. Style over function, I guess."
