  ancestry.com commercial. I realize this may well be custom logotype, and if it is,
  might anyone know a similarly designed font; else, does anyone know the font in
  use?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6040.gif]"

  body: "It certainly has the flavor of Perpetua in that enlargement.\r\n\r\nThe differences

    not that."
