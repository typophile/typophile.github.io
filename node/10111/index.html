Yeah I&#39;d say they&#39;re worth an hour each. <BR> <BR>To my eye the &#34;Art Center at Night &#149; Summer 2005&#34; spreads away from the counter too much at its endpoints. The &#34;Lea...&#34; portion of &#34;Learn...&#34; looks maybe a little too tightly curled and the &#34;...own fonts&#34; not tightly enough. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t really tell what&#39;s going on with the &#34;m&#34; in &#34;pm&#34;. In the drawing it looks sadly scrunched but on the wood background photo it looks fine while in the hangings I&#39;m not too sure. Maybe a redraw of the m? Maybe just move the &#34;Wednesday&#34; to the left more so the &#34;m&#34; doesn&#39;t have to turn down? <BR> <BR><i>...and I might make two more, but that&#39;s it.</i> suggests maybe no more time is warranted. <BR> <BR>Whatever.

But the crits will be useful if/when I do another batch... and next time I&#39;ll cough up the dough for something more suitable for the job than my trusty ol&#39; Swiss army knife... <BR> <BR>The type-on-path stuff is a bit jumpy, I admit. It was done with Illustrator 7, and by an amateur no less... But I did actually adjust the &#34;pm&#34; manually since making that first &#34;flat&#34; image - so it&#39;s better on the actual prints. <BR> <BR>One thing I&#39;m wondering about is: <BR>What font would work [even] better than Rockwell Extra Bold? <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;ve been meaning to ask, When do your classes start? <BR> <BR>And I&#39;ve been meaning to spam you about it :-&#41; since you&#39;re in LA... Registration starts April 11 &#40;enrollment is limited to 12 students&#41;, and the first class is on May 18. What&#39;s nice is they&#39;re giving us two rooms: a spacious one equipped for drafting, and a computer lab too. &#40;BTW, I&#39;ll be updating my News entry soon.&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I think your first idea was a very good one.  With some adjustments with the date &#40;reduce the size to avoid to break the smooth line at the end&#41; and the register line &#40;be more in the same curv as the bottom tail of the g&#41;. I  will keep the good suggestion from Eben how he used the text in the top tail. I&#39;d also suggest to use a sans typeface instead of a serif one for the text inside the g. <BR> <BR>Good work.</div>
