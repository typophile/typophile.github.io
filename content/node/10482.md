body: 'I hope this is fitting for this forum. It&#39;s more logo-related than logo-type-related,
  but seeing the great critiques here compelled me to post. Plus, I&#39;m the only
  graphic designer in the building, so it helps to get other&#39;s input. <BR> <BR>This
  is a logo for our branch of government here in MN. I&#39;ve come up with 3 variations
  that I &#40;and a few others&#41; seem to think are the strongest. I now need your
  harsh, honest critiques! <BR> <BR>There&#39;s one disclaimer, and one I&#39;ll probably
  take some heat for saying...but I an limited to only free fonts and whatevers on
  my machine &#40;gasp!&#41;. As our state is in the hole a few billion, getting darrel
  a few licensed fonts isn&#39;t really on the priority list. <BR> <BR>So, here they
  are. <BR> <BR>Logo one &#40;uses Tanek, from CSA&#41; represents the state &#40;duh&#41;
  and the 10 court districts rendered in a stained-glass-like way. This also hints
  at the stained glass ceiling installation in the supreme court. PROS: nice double-meaning,
  simple CONS: not as nice in one-color. <BR> <BR>Logo two &#40;uses Futura, from
  Apple, and Covington, from apostrophiclab&#41; is the more &#39;elegant&#39; of
  the bunch &#40;if not just a bit hokey&#41;. It&#39;s the state bird perched upon
  a roman column. &#40;bird = MN, column = courhouse&#41; PROS: most &#39;regal&#39;
  of the bunch CONS: is it hokey? &#40;Most have said &#39;no&#39; but I still wonder...&#41;
  <BR> <BR>Logo three &#40;uses Futura, from Apple&#41; is a simple rendering of common
  iconography...the state and the scales of justice. PROS: recognizable iconography
  CONS: cliche? Too trendy? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7047.gif"

    go with #1 you have some kerning to do. The <BR>&#34;MN&#34; is tucked into the

    was on purpose, but it distracts.'

  body: The loon is just looney. The third one is too artsy. I think the first one
    is the nicest, and the b&amp;w version could just dump the districts, or render
    them as lines. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: '#1 has a good concept, but the execution is too... Well,  <BR>too CSA, and
    is inappropriate. I&#39;m sure there are better  <BR>ways to execute an illustration
    here. Think fine-etched  <BR>engraving &#40;like money perhaps&#41;. <BR> <BR>#2
    is the only one that seems appropriate for a judicial  <BR>branch. The pillar
    is a better &#40;less obvious&#41; way to say  <BR>&#39;law&#39; than the scales
    of justice. That said, the pillar is still  <BR>obvious. Is there a classy way
    to render the loon, so it&#39;s  <BR>not so cartoony? <BR> <BR>#3 is way too trendy.
    The color, the illustration stlye,  <BR>even the subject matter is ultra-obvious
    &#40;which is why  <BR>you&#39;ve rendered it this way, I&#39;m guessing&#41;.
    I&#39;d avoid this  <BR>direction, even though, we could all guess that the  <BR>client
    asked for it. <BR> <BR>Best of luck.'

    respond to some of the comments... <BR> <BR>&#62; you have some kerning to do
    <BR> <BR>Yea, I really need to work on all of the type on these...I just set them
    as-is for now. <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;d be concerned in the third option about <BR>&#62;
    misinterpretation: &#39;In Minnesota, the road  <BR>&#62; to justice is a crooked
    one&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Do you think people would read that much into it? It&#39;s
    an interesting observation. <BR> <BR>&#62; The loon is just looney. <BR>and <BR>&#62;
    is the only one that seems appropriate  <BR>&#62; for a judicial branch.  <BR>
    <BR>&#42;sigh&#42;...that&#39;s been my dilema. I&#39;ll think I&#39;ll let the
    client decide on this one ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; 1 has a good concept, but the  <BR>&#62;
    execution is too... Well, too CSA <BR> <BR>Ha! There&#39;s a reason for that.
    I had a buddy over at CSA critique it and suggest a lot of what you see there...not
    to mention that &#40;coincidently&#41; the face I was using was from CSA as well.
    ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>I have some other variations of that that I&#39;ll work on...the
    fine-etched engraving idea is a good one. <BR> <BR>&#62; Is there a classy way
    to render the loon,  <BR>&#62; so it&#39;s not so cartoony? <BR> <BR>Do you think
    it&#39;s the illustration style, or the fact that it&#39;s just a loon? I&#39;ll
    work on that some more. <BR> <BR>&#62; #3 is way too trendy...even though, we
    could all guess that the client asked for it. <BR> <BR>It kind of goes without
    saying that one of the options needs to be a state/scales of justice. Yea, it&#39;s
    incredibly cliche, so I tried to at least have fun with it. I do have several
    other style variations that I&#39;ll post when I get the chance for comparison.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; I think the logo has to say strength and durability. <BR> <BR>Could
    you say a bit more about that Brennan? I assume you were referring to the column
    logo. Were you referring to the style? Line weight? <BR> <BR>Again, thanks everyone.
    I&#39;ll try and post some more this afternoon &#40;if not new stuff, some of
    the sketches up to this point...&#41; <BR> <BR>-Darrel <BR> <BR>'

    <BR>Well, the way I see it is that the Judicial system <BR>is about strength against
    criminality. <BR>A simple solid logo would convey that and I think <BR>No.2 will
    work well in that style. That pillar pic <BR>I posted was the kind of style I
    am refering to, <BR>bold and simple. <BR> <BR>bren <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'Far out! <BR> <BR>I like #1, but it&#39;s definitely unorthodox.  But if
    it works with the attitude of Minnesota and the state&#39;s other identity schemes,
    go for it. <BR> <BR>The spot colours in the stained glass part will look neat
    overprinted like that. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure I like the choice of fonts in

  body: '&#62; Well, the way I see it is that the Judicial system  <BR>&#62; is about
    strength against criminality. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s just one part of it. Criminal
    court is just a segment of the court system. There&#39;s juveniles, divorces,
    bankruptcies, child support, etc. So it&#39;s more about &#39;fairness for all&#39;
    than the courts being &#39;against&#39; anything in particular. <BR> <BR>That
    doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be a &#39;strong&#39; mark, though. ;o&#41;
    <BR> <BR>&#62;But if it works with the attitude of  <BR>&#62;Minnesota and the
    state&#39;s other identity <BR>&#62;schemes, go for it. <BR> <BR>Well, in some
    ways I am fortunate in that I&#39;m starting from scratch. There really aren&#39;t
    any departments with an identity &#40;except for maybe the tourism board&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Well, I was hoping to have new stuff to post, but the project has been side
    tracked this week. I did promise something, so here are some of the logo variations

    always known&#41; if you show a client multiple options, they&#39;ll always choose
    the least interesting of the bunch. I did try and simplify it a bit so it wasn&#39;t
    quite as trendy and hopefully the lock-up in a color block will be used consistently.
    We&#39;ll see. ;o&#41; I still need to tweak the kerning and such. <BR> <BR>Thanks
