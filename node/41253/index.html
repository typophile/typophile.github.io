I see, I was taking a more purist view of 'coding'. I would pick a font that you like best for your primary language and rely of font-fallback in your OS or text editor for the secondary languages. 

Hopefully we'll see more apps and OS's using 'composite fonts', where the user can specify which font (along with scaling and baseline adjustment) to use for each Unicode range - rather than pick a one-size-fits-all solution.

for coding purposes (a monospaced linear font), a pan-Unicode font would actually be useful. 

Monotype Imaging offers <strong>Andale Mono WT</strong>, a pan-Unicode monospaced font with the same design as the free Andale Mono font. There are four versions that cover the entire Unicode 3.0 range: Andale Mono WT J (Japanese), Andale Mono WT K (Korean), Andale Mono WT S (Simplified Chinese), Andale Mono WT T (Traditional Chinese). There is also a set of two fonts: Andale Mono WTG and Andale Mono WTG Surrogate, with the entire Unicode 3.2 range. Those fonts are also distributed e.g. by Ricoh (google for Andale Mono WT for more details). 

Ascender Corp. offers <strong>Ascender Uni</strong>, a pan-Unicode monospaced font with the entire character set of Unicode 5.0. The design is similar to Andale Mono. 

Microsoft offers <strong>Consolas</strong>, a great monospaced design by Luc(as) de Groot that covers extended Latin, Cyrillic and Greek that has regular, italic, bold and bold italic variants (Andale Mono and Ascender Uni only have one regular weight).

Of course, that’s <strong>not Andale Mono</strong>. It’s <strong>not Courier</strong> too. 
That’s <strong>Dialog Input</strong> shipped with Java Developer’s Kit, which works best for me as far.
Unfortunately, it’s not a masterpiece of legiblilty.
But it replaces missing characters.

I have found some pan-Unicode fonts listed here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_fonts

I have not tested <strong>Ascender Uni</strong> yet.

You can test your fonts on this source code:
http://taat.pl/typografia/typografia_wiele_jezykow.html

Let me know if it renders all characters correctly.

True, but that's not coding. HTML authoring (in your earlier example) is not coding either.

Coding is programming; that is, it's the process of writing executable computer instructions (i.e., <cite>code</cite>) in a computer programming language.

For what it's worth, I've been coding for over two decades, and I've never had the need for a "Unicode" font in my IDE. However, I do appreciate the desire for a pan-Unicode font for general-purpose use, which includes HTML authoring and database editing.

But let's not call that a "coding" font.</div>

However, as Simon said earlier, it's generally a bad idea to hard-code literal strings in code. The preferred way to handle all language-specific strings is to define them in a separate resource file and then write code to select the appropriate strings to use depending on context. That way, the code itself is always straight ASCII, and internationalization becomes much easier.</div>

Then, you store all language strings in separate files, as in library.

any problems with the links I have given? 

Simon, Spire, 

I don't understand why you're trying to prove Tomek that there's something wrong with his concept. 

Much of modern "HTML authoring" is synonymous with "development of web applications" -- that of course *is* coding because it as it often includes AJAX/JavaScript on the client side plus PHP or Java on the server side. 

Not all development projects involve "localization" or "internationalization". If you operate under the presumption that the default language is English and anything else is "international", this may be true. But just as easily, people develop web or desktop applications in a language that is not English, but they don't plan to localize or internationalize either. If I develop a website in Hebrew or Russian or Arabic or Japanese only, I simply want to type texts in that language in the source code. And if I'm writing and debugging a console application, or a Python script, I need a Unicode monospaced font, be it just for the console debugging output. 

In fact, I have been using Andale Mono WT for quite some time for the purpose of developing Python scripts within FontLab Studio. The Output panel (a text-only console) works with monospaced fonts and I often need to output Unicode text to it. 

I must admit that I find the notion that "code should be ASCII only" very antiquated. I've been using UTF-8 for my source code in Python for several years now.

I've merely been trying to explain why there isn't already a wide range of pan-Unicode fonts available for use in coding: it's because most programmers have no use for non-ASCII characters in their actual source code.

You say that you find the notion that "code should be ASCII only" very antiquated. Conversely, I find the notion that code should contained hard-coded literal strings very antiquated. We are both right, when taken in different contexts.

Your earlier post was been very helpful -- to me as well. In particular, I hadn't heard of Ascender Uni, and in fact I'm pretty excited to learn of it. I've been wanting a good pan-Unicode monospaced font for a long time (albeit for another purpose).

The concept that some plain-text files should use different encoding than others *is* antiquated, no matter what. In future, it only makes sense that plain-text files (even programming source code) are encoded using Unicode — even if a certain document format or programming language restricts the character set used for certain aspects, e.g. object names. 

But whether string literals should be intermixed with programming code or externalized depends on the type of application. If the application is text-intense and only contains comparably little programming code (i.e. it is more like a document with elements of a program, e.g. a dynamic web page) *and* it will only be deployed in a single language, then I think externalizing strings makes little sense. It becomes useful only in scenarios where you have a large overhead of programming code over text, or when you're developing for i18n scenarios. 

As you well know, XML can use any Unicode characters for element and attribute names. So you may use an XML document structure that looks like this: 

<code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;authors&gt;<br />
&lt;author type=&quot;main&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;firstname&gt;Юрий&lt;/firstname&gt;<br />
&lt;lastname&gt;Ярмола&lt;/lastname&gt;<br />
&lt;/author&gt;<br />
&lt;author&gt;<br />
&lt;firstname&gt;Adam&lt;/firstname&gt;<br />
&lt;lastname&gt;Twardoch&lt;/lastname&gt;<br />
&lt;/author&gt;<br />
&lt;/authors&gt;</code>

But others may prefer to define their document structure as follows: 

<code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br />

Both are valid XML structures, and it depends purely on the linguistic context which one will be chosen. The English language still holds some privileged position in electronic information processing, but this is changing.

		<div class="commentbody">Adam, I'm not sure what the argument is still about. I did acknowledge in my earlier post that you were correct. I think we each understand what the other is saying at this point.

In response to your last post, I'll just add that document encoding and actual character use are two separate issues. I never said that ASCII encoding was still a good thing; in fact, I definitely agree that it's antiquated and really needs to be phased out already. But even if the entire world magically switched overnight to, say, UTF-8-encoding for all text files (including all source code), I think most programmers would still have little use for non-ASCII characters in their actual code.

I think the whole reason this thread got sidetracked is that Simon and I were both surprised and taken aback by Tomek's categorical claim that "every coder... needs a fixed width font with Unicode support".

In any case, the bottom line is that pan-Unicode fonts are a Good Thing, regardless of what they might be used for.

Thank you Adam for your tips.
I have Consolas installed with Vista. Looks clear and nice, but the range is too small.
I’ve been testing some time ago Andale Mono WT J and WT S, but the same thing as above.

Ascender Uni is very promising.

Eben,
maybe you’ll take a look at those glyphs for a reference?
http://www.fontmarketplace.com/font/ascender-uni.aspx/301

Speaking of ranges: I’d like to have all Slavic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, simplified and extended Chineese, Korean and Japanese, Unicode ligatures and typographic symbols.
That’s a lot of work to do…

Now I use open source editor named jEdit, written in Java, on both, Linux and Windows. It works great on Mac too. The only font which displayed all the characters I needed was DialogInput so far.

		<div class="commentbody">I realize this is a defunct discussion, but I feel compelled.

Defining coding as creating something that gets compiled into an executable is a rather narrow definition.  As a computational linguist, I do things which I consider to be coding, but which do not get converted into executables per se.  One of these things is to code finite state transducers for various human languages, using tools like the Xerox and Stuttgart Finite State Transducers (xfst and sfst respectively).  I have also done coding in XML, where the XML is intended to be converted into the programming language of one of these FSTs.  Once in awhile I've programmed things in Python (and co-workers have done so in Perl or even C) to modify the XML code for these FSTs or for dictionaries, and occasionally it's necessary to embed Unicode characters in these programs--not as strings to appear in dialog boxes or such like, but as parts of strings or regular expressions that the Python etc. code needs find in the XML and modify.  

Apart from C, all these programming languages use interpreters.

The human languages we work with have included Bengali, Arabic and Urdu (Urdu uses the Arabic code range of Unicode).  I wouldn't be surprised if we worked with other Indic languages in the future, and Ethiopic languages are not out of the question.

I regularly use jEdit or Visual Slickedit for writing these programs; some of my co-workers use emacs.  We also use XMLmind, although that is mostly for DocBook-type XML, which I suppose you don't consider to be coding.

So I think I feel safe in calling what I and my co-workers do "coding", even though it does not always result in executables.  Hard-coding literal strings is really the only option for these programs, especially for the FSTs where the whole point is to deal with dozens or even hundreds of such strings in the morphology and phonology of these languages.  We certainly use programmers' editors, and at least jEdit does not "support user-definable fonts for each Unicode range".  (I asked a couple months ago, and it's probably at the bottom of their priority list.)

		<div class="commentbody">I'm amazed how many people here are saying that a unicode font is unnecessary for "coding." 

Some of us out here actually have to deal with multiple languages IN CODE (not HTML) on a daily basis. For example, parsing Asian text using a regex. Or Asian developers who might actually comment their code in their native languages -- and on and on. Just because _you_ haven't had to deal with this stuff doesn't mean that others don't -- more than a billion of us, in fact.

FYI, I came here looking for a better-looking fixed-width unicode font for gvim because I often deal with source code that includes Japanese for various reasons.

		<div class="commentbody">So then I suppose that if you wanted to you could take a coding font and merge it with a MS Japanese font ( you would want to scale the latin to match the Japanese I think... )  - as long as it didn't violate the EULA. If it did you might be able to look on the Adobe side of the aisle. Now I wish I knew more about rendering for Japanese. It strikes me that the adobe fonts are probably less screen and more print oriented.. Maybe that's wrong as well. But what about local makers. When I was in Japan in the late 80's there no shortage ( seemingly ) of Japanese fonts in a variety of styles and especially ones which were screen oriented. But maybe they are NEC specific or something. Then again I wasn't a font nut yet. Maybe they are not great... I look forward to hearing more about this from somebody with more of an insider's view. Perhaps increasing screen rez will also make the problem less acute as well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I stumbled on this discussion with much interest.

I'm currently trying to work with Jim Tauber's MorphGNT text file (a standard in Greek New Testament coding).  

This file consists of all the words of the Greek New Testament, one per line, with the part of speech (noun/verb) and other grammatical info.  At the end of the line, in polytonic Greek unicode characters, is the word, and the 'dictionary' form of that word.

I think he must be editing this file in Unix, because I can't find a unicode fixed width font that will display this file correctly on Windows.  Courier New just gives square boxes against the characters that have accents over them.

Consolas doesn't do the job, sadly.

Is there any chance that it can be enhanced to support polytonic Greek characters?</div>

I was told:

<ul>
DejaVu Sans Mono: [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dejavu/]]
Everson Mono: [[http://www.evertype.com/emono/]]
FreeMono: [[http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/]]
GNU Unifont: [[http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html]]

are all fixed-width and support Unicode polytonic Greek (although some aren’t the most attractive fonts).

Good resources for this sort of thing:
[[http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts.html]]
[[http://www.unifont.org/fontguide/]]
</ul>

I've not had a chance to try any of these, but any thoughts would be interesting.</div>
