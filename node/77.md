body: For those of you that were able to nail the &#34;american summer&#34; font so
  quikly &#40;thanks a ton by the way&#41; do you happen to know what font they use
  for the &#34;state menu&#34; at <a href="http://www.ae.com/aestyle/" target="_blank">www.ae.com/aestyle/</a>
  and i think it&#39;s the same font if you go to <a href="http://www.ae.com" target="_blank">www.ae.com</a>
  and it&#39;s on the pop-up ad for &#34;free beach towel&#34; if you could ID that
  one that would rock! and Trouble man holler at me about the Photoshop hints!  <BR>
