  body: "I'm pretty convinced that this is not a font, although it's hard to prove
    when the only duplicated letter is an 'i'. However, I think you could get a somewhat
    similar feel from <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg9.html\"> Sign
    DNA's 'Chicago Style'</a>, or even <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0002937\">Adobe
    Caflisch Script</a>.\r\n\r\nSome of House's painter scripts, and their 'Fabulous',
    as well as a couple of Jason Walcott's scripts (Jukebox Foundry at Veer.com) might
    also be close enough substitutes.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    That's one I need to add to the Guide, if I can get a sample of it. You wouldn't
    want to make a sample would you?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
