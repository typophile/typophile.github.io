body: "Hi all, \r\nFirst post here, hopefully you can assist me. This is a sans used
  in different weights throughout. It is very familiar but i have not been able to
  work it out for myself using Google, WhatTheFont etc. Similar letterform to something
  like Camingo. The ampersand may be a give away to many contributors on here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JamiMag_Sans_ID_4722.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\ns."
