  body: The site looks nice, Jim. Congrats. What happened to the <BR>kerning on the
    right column of the supporters page? And <BR>there are some missing font names
    on the CD page. Is that <BR>by design?

  body: This is really a great cause to support... plus well worth the cost for this
    as a collectors item on it&#39;s own. Anyone fortunate enough to be able to use
    a computer should click on over and help out. <BR>I&#39;m going to order my copy
    right now. <BR> <BR>Bravo Jim! <BR> <BR>
