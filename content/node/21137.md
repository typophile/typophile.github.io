  for forms etc. \r\nI know there would be a much more efficient and simple way of
  doing this, I just don't \r\nknow what to search for in help? Is it in paragraph
  rules, do you have to make a table? \r\n\r\nAny help with this would be greatly
  appreciated. Attached is a screen shot of a form \r\nthat I am doing at the moment
  (pretty rough). \r\n\r\nTHANKS\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Form_4019.png]"

      be adjusted?

  body: "Mark's is an elegant solution. If you want more control over the weight and
    style of the rule, scrap the Leader and style your tabbed text with an Underline
    which can be fine-tuned via the \"Underline Options\" in the Character Palette's
    popup menu.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/underline-options_5213.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/InDesignScreenSnapz002_4583.jpg]"

  body: The most common mistake I see are fields that aren't large enough for handwritten
    responses. Run your form through a few tests with realistic responses before going
    to press.

  body: I use Mark Simonson's tab method, but adjust the weight of the underscore
    by changing the font used -- after setting the tab, the underscores can be selected
    and the font changed like any other text character. In your example, you could
    use Futura Light, for instance.

  body: "You can also paste rules into the text and adjust the length and weight and
    the baseline it sits on, you can also use word space to separate the rule from
    the text. \r\n\r\nbtw in your sample there are some spacing issues between colon
    and rule and text and colon, from a personal aesthetic I would remove the colons
    and use a word space to separate.\r\n\r\nDoes the underscore method survive ripping
    etc? I would have guessed that a slight gap could appear in some fonts if they
    weren't drawn precisely\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Whenever I use underscores in forms (either keyed directly or placed as leaders
    with tabs), I like to apply a lot of negative tracking to the underscores themselves
    to avoid any gaps that might appear with normal spacing.
