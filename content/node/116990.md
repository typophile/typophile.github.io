  body: "Do you have an idea as to the vintage of the cheque?\r\nSomething like this
    would:\r\nA. have been engraved or lithographed for the bank, or\r\nB. if the
    bank was small it might purchase a special cut from a type foundry which would
    include everything shown in the image. These cuts were sometimes called billheads,
    or more recently \r\nC. a lettering artist would do the design and this would
    be photographed for printing.\r\nThere might be a font with the interesting treatment
    of the e, but I don't recall it offhand.\r\nDon"

  body: It is a modern check that I copied this from.  It probably is by a lettering
    artist.  Thanks for your help!
