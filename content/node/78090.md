  with the OpenType LatPro encoding. I am curious about why longs_t is the only longs-
  ligature. It seems odd to me because it is certainly a not-so common glyph. I mean,
  if I were to include some ligature with longs, I\u2019d go first for something like
  longs_i, longs_l or even longs_longs (i. e., the equivalents to f_i, f_l and f_f,
  the most common f- ligatures)."

    where the longs has a much longer tradition then elsewhere with its use in fraktur
