body: "Looking for a Sans Serif typeface which will be used for a Gardens identity
  in South East Asia. \r\n\r\nThe object of the typography is to reflect:\r\n\u2022
  Clarity (simplicity) for use throughout signage (there will be some areas of the
  site where the type will be used at a size of three meters in height).\r\n\u2022
  Intrigue through organic elements when used at a interpretative level (to subtly
  reference the concept of the gardens/plant forms \u2013 rounded tips, organic flourishes
  etc).\r\n\u2022 Large variation (from thin to bold/black) with the possibility of
  a slab serif relative; although this is not a requirement.\r\n\u2022 The type should
  balance well against the languages of the far east, notably Chinese/Mandarin, Japanese,
  Malay (all signage will be set in a minimum to two languages)\r\n\r\nI have trailed
  through numerous type foundries sites to find solutions. One suggestion was Stag
  Sans although this typeface is primarily used in an editorial context ( http://vllg.com/Schwartzco/StagSans/mudTyper+Weights/).
  \r\n\r\nThe other option is Vista Sans (\xC9migr\xE9). Vista has the relevant \u2018organic
  elements\u2019 although feels slightly unrefined and clumsy when used at large type
  sizes; notably signage.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the family had variations which
  varied from simplicity (singage) to 'creative' (interpretation/identity).\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? Help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Have you looked at Fresco (or Fresco Plus) from <a href="http://www.ourtype.be/">Ourtype</a>?
    There's also sans (+ condensed), script and informal versions.

    and a wide range of weights.
