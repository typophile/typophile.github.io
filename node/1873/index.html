		<div class="commentbody">&#62;<i>in my garage i have tons of old image club catalogs...</i> <BR> <BR>Heh. So do I. Imagine that. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>You never got any public credit for those faces, is that correct?</i> <BR> <BR>We never credited the designers in the Image Club or EyeWire catalogs, but we did include attributions <a href="http://www.eyewire.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/View.woa/wa/viewProduct-product=527.htm">on the web site</a>. In fact, you can still view them in amongst the broken remains of the EyeWire site. I was also fortunate &#40;or cursed&#41; enough to have <a href="http://www.eyewire.com/magazine/profiles/hutchinson/index.htm">a designer profile</a> written about my type exploits back when I was still at EyeWire. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>I see that Identifont has you in its database now. Woohoo!</i> <BR> <BR>Yep. I&#39;m very happy to see that finally in place too. I emailed back and forth with David Johnson-Davies quite a bit to get all the Image Club information properly cleaned up and cross-referenced. Plus I was able to give him all of the nit-picky designer credits from my type library database. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>Did you have a script face in the TypeCon gallery?</i> <BR> <BR>Oops. That was mis-credited at TypeCon. I did the design of the sample, not the typeface. The typeface was <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?Image=JBT0000059">Hucklebuck</a> by Jason Walcott &#40;Jukebox&#41;. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;<i>1&#41; Thanks for the link to Stephen&#39;s Stockholm typography pics</i> <BR> <BR>You&#39;re welcome. These are things that need to be shared. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>2&#41; Do you know what Agfa/Monotype&#39;s arrangement with Image Club fonts is?</i> <BR> <BR>My understanding is that AMT purchased the Image Club Type Library, the associated trademarks and the EyeWire website from Getty Images. They did <b>not</b> purchase the remaining Image Club or EyeWire products such as the clip art or stock images&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>Why do I ask? At $42 USD a pop, these fonts are priced considerably higher</i> <BR>&#62;<i>than most other fonts from Fonts.com. This leads suspicious me to a &#40;probably</i> <BR>&#62;<i>naive &amp; inaccurate&#41; possible conclusion of A/MT the sales of these fonts, but</i> <BR>&#62;<i>at a price point they know won&#39;t fly. Eventually they&#39;re able to buy out all</i> <BR>&#62;<i>rights to the fonts at a fire sale price. I&#39;m probably way off base here, but</i> <BR>&#62;<i>with older fonts at $22 and new releases at $22 to $32, something seems amiss.</i> <BR> <BR>The current pricing for the Image Club single faces is certainly higher than they were at EyeWire. Although, I always thought that they were underpriced to begin with. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any conspiracy here, I suspect that AMT understands that there was some pent up demand for those faces during the dead period of the EyeWire business. Since they already own the library, I don&#39;t think there is any advantage to positioning them for failure. <BR> <BR>Of course, I may be a bit biased in my opinions on this subject. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>3&#41; Does the Image Club branding still exist in any way.</i> <BR>&#62;<i>It certainly isn&#39;t revealed on Fonts.com</i> <BR> <BR>Other than on my hard drive and in my Image Club archives, I don&#39;t think so. Agfa certainly isn&#39;t going to be using the Image Club name or brand for anything. AMT&#39;s own branding currently wavers between schizophrenic and that glutinous mass of sub-brands and third-party products on the Fonts.com site. I can&#39;t see them doing any Image Club specific marketing, even if they do own the brand now. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>I&#39;m really glad that A/MT kept the IC fonts alive, but I&#39;ve followed them</i> <BR>&#62;<i>through their various homes and I&#39;m curious about their current home.</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m pleased they got picked up as well, although in their current state &#40;missing formats, missing weights, strange pricing, no full collection&#41; - I wonder how long they&#39;ll last. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>4&#41; Nice work on east Bloc.</i> <BR> <BR>Thanks. It seems so long ago...</div>
