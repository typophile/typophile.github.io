  body: "Angled terminals like your _V_ are found in the lowercase of Jenson Oldstyle
    designed by J. W. Phinney of the Dickinson Type Foundry in 1893, [img:sites/default/files/old-images/JensonOSLC_5304.jpg]
    but not in the uppercase.  Now available as LTC Jenson  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-jenson/
    \r\nThe terminal style was popular circa 1900 and it was used in the uppercase
    of some lettering designs. Some digging might turn up a digital font with the
    _V_.\r\ndon"
