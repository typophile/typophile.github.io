  body: "Can you please help me identify the fonts on this plaque\r\n\r\nThe whom
    it may concern\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you could please help me identify the
    fonts on this car club plaque. I've gone through some of the biggest font databases
    I can find, and I cannot find this font anywhere. I really need your help and
    expertise on this subject.\r\n\r\nWhat I need to know is, the exact name of the
    font, and what family of font does it derived from, and the name of the company
    where I can buy this from. The fonts in particular I'm trying to identify are
    \"old memories\".\r\n\r\nI've included a JPG photo of the plaque for you to look
    at. I really hope you can help me out here, because I keep running into dead ends,
    and run out of places to look.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help.\r\n\r\nMichael
