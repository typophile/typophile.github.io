  body: You mean using the English alphabet? That&#39;s generally tough.  :-&#41;
    <BR>I pronounce it &#34;kokh&#34;, but Spiekermann recently stated&#42; it&#39;s
    actually &#34;kok&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#42; At TC2004. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'That&#39;s a question about how you want Rudolf Koch to be pronounced: typically
    german or typically english. You might try it out and decide what you prefer at

    <BR> <BR>Just type &#34;Rudolf Koch&#34; into the big white square and choose
    a speaker. The &#34;most german&#34; variety seems to me: Stimme: Steffen &#40;deutsch&#41;

  body: 'i think &#34;kokh&#34; comes close, &#34;kok&#34; is more the regular way
    english people pronounce the &#34;ch&#34; but most german people will know what
    you mean when you pronouce it &#34;kok&#34;.  <BR>the &#34;ch&#34; is indead difficult
    as there&#39;s no equivalent in english for that.  <BR> <BR>here&#39;s another
    try &#40;from the bbc website&#41;: <BR> <BR>The ch sounds a bit like the &#39;h&#39;
    in English huge after i.  <BR>But ch is harder after au - more like the &#39;ch&#39;
    in Scottish loch <BR> <BR>hth: lars'

  body: Thank you all for your guidance - including Ute who emailed me directly! I
    was actually hoping for &#34;kook&#34; or &#34;kosh&#34; since I teach very young
    college students and even though &#34;Koch&#34; might mean &#34;cook&#34; in german,
    it doesn&#39;t have quite the same meaning in english. Thanks again! <BR> <BR>Andrea

  body: The standard way to explain how to pronounce the German ch is that it is like
    the ch in &#39;Bach&#39;, the composer. It is usually pronounced correctly  on
    classical music radio, and many Americans can handle that rather easily - much
    more easily than the umlaut vowels in German. <BR> <BR>If he pronounced it in
    some dialect rather than standard German, then I guess it might be the hard k,
    but I believe the standard way would make the ch as in Bach.

  body: That&#39;s a wonderful analogy, William, thank you so much. I can pronounce
    the name much better that way. And Laura - thanks for the link - what a great
    site!
