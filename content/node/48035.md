body: "hi,\r\na lot of my old (or converted) fonts have wrong font familiy information
  in the font header.\r\nExample:\r\nFont Name: franklingothic-black\r\nFont Familiy:
  franklingothic-black\r\n\r\nThat should obviously be changed to:\r\nFont Name: franklingothic-black\r\nFont
  Familiy: franklingothic\r\n\r\nOr even better to:\r\nThat should obviously be changed
  to:\r\nFont Name: Franklin Gothic Black\r\nFont Familiy: Franklin Gothic\r\n\r\nIs
  there a software available (best would be for OSX) to do this automatically with
  all my fonts?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\norbi"
