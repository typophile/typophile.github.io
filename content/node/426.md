body: I&#39;m not a designer, but as my father is kind of director of a ceramics school,
  i submitted him ideas for a logo for his school. There isn&#39;t, and every single
  compagny paper they have are of very poor quality &#40;the worse is that there&#39;s
  a &#34;graphism&#34; branch in another school of the same group&#41;. <BR>So though
  i know my things really not deserves to be there, i guess maybe you can give me
  ideas to make it less miserable &#40;in all cases, it will be better than the nothing
  they have&#41;. <BR>There&#39;s an old first version, made with Dominican &#40;which
  appears to me to fit well with ceramics&#41; and another with tyfa &#40;which is
  more modern but still make tghink of some past in my view&#41;. <BR>Be hard, i really
  haven&#39;t any pretention. You can&#39;t hurt me.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12086.gif"

    softness, somehow. Or even some mix of styles? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: So if i understand well, you&#39;ld keep the tyfa one, but you&#39;ld add
    some softness. Does it implies to search another font, or to make any treatment,
    and what ? <BR>I appreciate your help.

    would like to see the &#34;de provence&#34; done in an italic like in the third
    one, though.  If you have a distressed italic to go with the main face that is.

    the school...i noticed <BR>a typographic anomaly... <BR> <BR>each word has two
    Es. <BR> <BR>Anyway, as we sometimes do here at typophile, <BR>I took the liberty
    of messing around with <BR>your work, just for kicks. <BR> <BR>I tried A, which
    wasn&#39;t working. <BR> <BR>&#34;B&#34; might be a step in a decent direction,
    but <BR>it needs something &#40;flourishes to the left and <BR>right of de Provence?&#41;
    to make <BR>it into a real logo, er, trademark. <BR> <BR> <BR>Anyway, you might
    explore this concept further with <BR>some other typefaces, Tyfa?, and some different
    <BR>E treatments. <BR> <BR>You might also follow the advice of the experts, but
    <BR>remember, hrant is NOT a graphic designer. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: '&#62;Yes, a logo working for ceramics is probably harder to do. But i&#39;m
    not sure letters are more difficult to do than a mosaic thing. It&#39;s an interesting
    way to go, but despite the name, the school teaches also plate decoration &amp;
    things like that, so if the ceramics motto is a thing to explore, i guess i don&#39;t
    have to be to precise about it, if you see what i mean. About the ADEF &#40;this
    is it&#41; logo, i don&#39;t think i can do anything. They don&#39;t have even
    a designer &#40;there&#39;s maybe someone who&#39;s in charge of it, being a secretary
    or so, and they don&#39;t care all all. Seeing their communication is made by

    even if it&#39;s aesthetically nice.&#34; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s the crux of the
    matter though. <BR> <BR>If people recognise what you&#39;re trying to say, even
    if the design is meaningless through a design standpoint, you&#39;ve done your
    job as a designer. <BR> <BR>You can have perfectly good design, playing by the
    rules and all that, that can be aestheticly pleasing, yet more often than not,
    it&#39;s the breaking of the rules that actually makes a design aesthetically
    pleasing. <BR> <BR>When I see your first logo, I see right away what it says,
    and I look at the way you emphasize the E and think it&#39;s a novel away of dealing
    with the situation. <BR> <BR>Then I look at your updated design, and see the same
    type of process going on, but say to myself &#34;how boring&#34;. <BR> <BR>Before
    you decide, do this:  Take both of your designs and show them to laypersons and
    see which design they like the best.  That is the design you should stick with.
    <BR> <BR>You&#39;re not designing your logo for designers, you&#39;re designing
    it for the common person, and they want something that looks nice.'

  body: Guillaume. There is something nice about this latest version. The hand shows
    through. Similar to ceramics, you can often see the hand in the work. However,
    I think the silhouette of the vase is too tricky. I wouldn&#39;t use that.  Can
    you unify the weights? The widths on the strokes and interior lines change too
    much. <BR> <BR>As for the first version. Having the E large as you do, completely
    confuses the hierarchy of legibility. And as JFP pointed out you have too much
    going on. <BR> <BR>I would say Tyfa is of the crunchy variety. Not creamy. On
    the other hand, Biblon is super creamy.

  body: Guillaume, <BR> <BR>I have to agree with Tiffany. The vase shape seemed too
    contrived before. Now that it&#39;s also the C and the accent, it feels even more
    so. <BR> <BR>I like the handlettered feel of ECP2. Take out the vase and work
    to make the weight even as Tiffany suggested &#40;Draw a real cap for the C and
    P rather than enlarging one&#41;. I like the horizontal rules in the type though.
    It subtly suggested a coil pot to me. This can look very elegant too if you want.

    try something completely else &#40;I don&#39;t know how you are used to do that,
    but I would take a sketchbook and go to the coast or mountains somewhere...&#41;.
    Actually I would read this last version as &#34;eramique&#34; instead of &#34;Ceramique&#34;,
    if I would not have seen the earlier posts. Personally I even can&#39;t see a
    possibility to make a vase out of a serifed C letter without loosing the legibility

    tell me. It&#39;s a pity because i liked both the idea and the look. I&#39;m going
    to the south, very soon, so i guess i&#39;ll have to think about it around the
    seaS&#60;caron&#62; My father himself is a drawer, and a talented one, so i&#39;ll
    try to work with him on other ideas.
