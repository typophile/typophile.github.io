    right is <a href=\"http://www.ngw.nl/int/gbr/w/westmins.htm\">City of Westminster</a>\r\n\r\nSo
    I think its pretty safe to say it's something to do with London."

    in naming things wouldn't hurt.\r\n\r\nwhen you see SPQR at the bottom of each

  body: "David\r\n\r\nMy dictionary says of logo, <em>\"a trademark, company emblem
    or similar device\"</em>\r\n\r\nSo it's an heraldic shield (technically an escutcheon).
    I knew what artslons meant and this place is all about efficient communication.
    Sometimes that's offensive.\r\n\r\nNot everyone's first language is English. Should
    we ignore posts for bad definitions/nomenclature/grammar/syntax? I don't think
    so.\r\n\r\nYes 'SPQR' is pretty 'efficient branding' isn't it. 'Gladiator' had
    it tattooed on his arm and I thought, rightly or wrongly, \"that is great branding\".\r\n\r\nCome
    back if you find out where the logo/escutcheon is from. I'd quite like to know.\r\n"

    Google throws up the address of the Healthcare Commission, LON 15399, London,
    EC1B 1QW. So perhaps it relates in some way to an address\u2026\r\n\r\nHappy hunting."
