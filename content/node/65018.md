body: "Here's the deal. I'm pretty happy with <strong>A</strong>. I'm trying to design
  a weight lighter and I'd like some guidance on which approach works better. The
  main difference between <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> is that  <strong>C</strong>'s
  counterspaces are wider. Proportionally, which one of these is better? Right now,
  these heavy designs are for display, but I might progress to designing lighter weights
  with a more text-friendly approach. Backward huh? \r\n\r\nAlso, comments on specific
  glyphs would be greatly appreciated.\r\n"

  body: I think A is the best. The overlap of the letters creates a more striking
    visual effect than the other two.

  body: Sorry, I could've been clearer. I meant to ask which is better <strong>between
    B and C</strong>. In the font family, A is the extra black, and either B or C
    will be the black.

  body: That's what I'm thinking, but looking at the negative space in "ION" of B
    and C, it seems C has a better, balanced pattern. Is that important in a display
    face such as this?

  body: If it were a logo, I would say "absolutely". Being a typeface, you should
    consider the whole of the alphabet and its combinations.

  body: "Frankly they all seem like legitimate separate members of a family. Could
    you just call C \"extended\" and move along from there?\r\n\r\nAnother thought
    is to mix the one-story letters of C (o,b,d,D,O) with the two-story letters of
    B (a,e,s,E,S). Horizontal counters in the two-story letters are the main flaw
    of C to my eyes.\r\n\r\nYou could also probably find a good compromise by interpolating
    them."

title: which of these designs is more "correct"?
