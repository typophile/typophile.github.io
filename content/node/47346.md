body: "Hi\r\nI have noticed that WPF Text Formatter does not show ligature marks in
  Arabic OpenType fonts correctly, that is when it tries to render a lam+kasra+alef+fatha,
  for example, it palces both kasra and fatha marks after lamalef ligature.\r\nIt
  seems that WPF does not use Uniscribe and may be the ligature-mark feature of OpenType
  is not yet implemented in it or I am missing some point.\r\nPlease advise me.\r\nThanks"

  body: As I understand it, WPF does not use Uniscribe, but its own text handler should
    produce the same results as Uniscribe. I will bring this discussion to the attention
    of Uniscribe and WPF engineers.

  body: "WPF implements complete OpenType layout format specification. It is not using
    Unisribe and does not share code with it. There are may be bugs in it. Although
    we spent lots of time testing it and endure it produces the same results as Uniscribe,
    it is relatively new product and less people outside Microsoft had a chance to
    test it with various fonts and scripts. \r\n\r\nYou may want to provide more details
    about what is not working for you, so we can invesigate. Does it happen with all
    or only particular Arabic fonts? What is special about the string you are shaping?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"

  body: "Sergey, I've confirmed this bug in WPF Arabic handling. If you enter the
    characters \u0644\u064E\u0627\u0650 within WPF both marks are positioned relative
    to the left letter (alif) of the ligature, rather than the first, above marks
    being positioned relative to the right letter (lam). I tested this with a randomly
    selected Linotype Arabic font and also with Microsoft's own Arabic Typesetting
    font. It appears that WPF is failing to correctly enumerate ligature components."

    is the most powerful Arabic Typesetting system ever developed.\r\nVersion 6 can
    now handle M$OTFs besides its own OTFs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
