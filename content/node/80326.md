body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am looking for a good, legible in windows, body text
  serif companion (a web font and one free, not from a paid service for technical
  reasons) for <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/n7mrhv\"> League Gothic</a>.\r\n\r\nThis
  is for a magazine-type website, I want a modern but austere look, with league gothic
  set in all caps for titles and meta and  the actual content of the site in a serif.
  \r\n\r\nOne I thought of is Georgia, but I don't know if they combine well, what
  do you think? Actually i would prefer a less common choice, maybe Droid Serif? Is
  it a good choice to pair with League Gothic?  \r\n\r\nAny opinions and options is
  appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance"
