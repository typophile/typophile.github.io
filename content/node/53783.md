  offer any comments,\r\nthat would be helpful.\r\nI\u2019ve only used Avant Garde,
  because that whats they\u2019ve got in their logo,and trying to keep some consistency.\r\nI
  feel a little stuck about what direction to go with it really.\r\nI want to use
  a font thats friendly, but suggests credibility as well.\r\nShould i try and find
  something with a similar feel to avant garde, to go with the logo, or something
  to contrast it.\r\nIt would be nice to get a consistent look,with the body copy
  and display,\r\nthroughout all flyers, poster etc.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\nmany
  thanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fly2_5016.jpg]"
