  Dickens: A Life</em></a>.\r\nI bought it for a long plane ride, primarily for my
  interest in the beginnings of the modern magazine, and to learn something of the
  lives of creatives in that era, paying special attention to the relationship between
  capital, freelancing and technology in emergent media.\r\n\r\nI did interrupt my
  reading to skip through <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/mar/21/squash-james-willstrop-shot-ghost\"><em>Shot
  and a Ghost</em></a> by James Willstrop, lent to me by a squash buddy. I left out
  the personal bits and concentrated on the matches and his diet and training. Quite
  a different kind of personality than Dickens, but still young, and he may yet follow
  an unconventional path when he retires from professional competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    better quality wood (or painted over it), but knowing the story behind the effect,

    my alley. While it can be a little repetitive (seemingly everyone he worked with
    felt he was talented but insecure and manipulative), it's redeemed by interesting
    tidbits about the songwriting/publishing/recording industry. And I'm about the
    read the part about his work with the Beatles, which is bound to be interesting.
