body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI've been struggling with the capitals of Sensato U lately
  and the U in particular refuses to look good. I've made 3 different U's, shown underneath.
  \r\n\r\n- The first is a sort of lowercase approach. I've seen this done before,
  without sticking out as 'wrong' to me.\r\n\r\n- The second is a compromise. The
  basic shape is still there, but the thin vertical stroke is thickened heavily for
  a better colour.\r\n\r\n- The third is the original, based on how I would design
  a U in a low-contrast sans-serif. The problem with this is that it causes a really
  light spot when next to letters like A.\r\n\r\n- I also included an alternative
  for the C, also with a more lowercase approach.\r\n\r\nI would just like to know
  what you think of it. Which ones disturbe you the least? Any other critique is also
  appreciated, as always.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SensatoE_U-issue_3416.jpg]"

  body: Analogue as in 'not digital'? No I haven't, and I wouldn't know where to look.

  body: By now I think the first offers the best color. I would like to see the second
    variation with the same thickness as the first. You should also correct the bump
    on the right curve of the second 'U'; I know its derived from the intentional
    concavity of the stem, but make the transition smoother. Perhaps it's just a matter
    of hinting...

  body: I've already settled on the first. Consider this one closed.

  body: First U wins. And the C with 2 serifs is better.

  body: Analogue means here "similar, a-like, same sort". So in this case an analogue
    font would be one that has a high contrast for example.

  body: Maybe curves on 1st /U/ could be smoother, and you could set the right lower
    end as you've done for /d/

  body: Analogue is a noun. Analogous is an adjective.
