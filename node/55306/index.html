		<div class="commentbody"><p>I feel like writing a long post. :-)  Though I&rsquo;m only a beginner so please take my comments with a large grain of salt.</p>
<p>This looks interesting, even though it&rsquo;s positioning itself in a rather densely populated genre. For instance, a few glyphs (especially the &ldquo;e&rdquo;) instantly reminded me of Etelka. It might be quite fruitful to do some research in this genre (if you haven&rsquo;t done so already).</p>
<p>To give deeper / more meaningful feed-back, it would be good to know what purpose you have in mind for this – is it intended for display, or text sizes?</p>
<p>My main impression – especially if this is not only meant for large sizes – is that it&rsquo;s very &ldquo;graphic design-y&rdquo;, which mostly means there are a lot of identical shapes. I wonder if that is intended; and even if it is, I doubt it&rsquo;d work at least in smaller sizes.</p>
<p>For one thing, the &ldquo;b&rdquo;, &ldquo;d&rdquo;, &ldquo;p&rdquo;, and &ldquo;q&rdquo; look like they might all be the same shape, mirrored / rotated; I tend to think the &ldquo;b&rdquo; and &ldquo;p&rdquo; are working better – the &ldquo;d&rdquo; and &ldquo;q&rdquo; look &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; to me. Similarly, the &ldquo;u&rdquo; seems to be a rotated &ldquo;n&rdquo; – and looks slightly too wide as a consequence.</p>
<p>What you have here is an interesting idea, but I believe it could grow to be much more if you are ready to dive deeper into the intricacies of type design, where it departs from the simpler/straighter (IMHO) premises of graphic design.</p>
<p>Some detail impressions:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d try a monocameral &ldquo;g&rdquo;. This one seems out of character (and even if one accepts the basic premise for a second, I&rsquo;m not sure the tail works).</p>
<p>&ldquo;k&rdquo;: It does look nice, but may be out of character in this font. Have you tried a double join? Or maybe one with a crossbar?</p>
<p>At least if this is going to be a text face, the joins on the &ldquo;n&rdquo; and &ldquo;m&rdquo; may be too high.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;o&rdquo; is way too round.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;s&rdquo; looks pretty nice – congrats. Though it may have a hair too much weight in the tight curves, especially the bottom-right. I believe the usual way to do it is to put the most weight on the spine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something slightly off-putting about the &ldquo;x&rdquo;; then again, I haven&rsquo;t figured the &ldquo;x&rdquo; out myself so I can&rsquo;t really say why. Perhaps it&rsquo;s too narrow?</p>
<p>I like the &ldquo;y&rdquo; a lot, especially the join.</p>
<p>Is the diagonal of the &ldquo;z&rdquo; a bit too heavy?</p>
<p>Keep us posted. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,
I agree with some of Nina&rsquo;s observations, thought the pbdq thing was unexpected. 
I agree there&rsquo;s a whole lot of other fonts in the square sans genre these days so if you want to market this you&rsquo;ll need to be definite about making it different.
My initial feelings were about the g,u and m. The g needs reconsidering. The bowl is too round and the tail is a bit flat. u needs a higher join, and the mnr could be lower as Nina said. m looks too wide to me. 
a and c don&rsquo;t quite harmonise because c is curved on top and a looks straight. 
I think the traps on vwy should carry over to z. The round shapes could do with more overshoot.
Again, I&rsquo;m not very advanced in fontmaking so feel free to add more salt&hellip; :)</div>

<p>I think I would give the g tail a more natural curve than the filleted round that is on there now. Nothing against the the fillet, it just doesn&rsquo;t show up any where else in the design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That does look a bit more natural. But do you think the shape only needs that curve tweak? I&rsquo;m not sure this &ldquo;g&rdquo; has anything much to do with the rest of the font, and that tail still looks rather strained, and struggling for width. 
Please do enlighten me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi there, first i would like to say thanks to the responses that we had.
To explain the initial idea for this font, this is not for a paid client, it has born from the major interest that 3 persons from the studio, have in typography, and would like to improve their knowledges and after some hard study and investigation, we started to do a font that somehow represented a bit of each of us, we have take some nordic inspiration, and without doubt FF Signa was a major one(of course without the intend of beeing a clone), FF Max, Etelka from StormTypeFoundry, and some portuguese from Dstype.
Our major intent is to be a text font, readable and modern with some &ldquo;cool&rdquo; feeling behind it.</p>
<p>Answering to Altaira and Bendy (thank you :) ), the mirrored &ldquo;p,b,q,d&rdquo; it really needs more atention and perhaps with would work better with a little diferences between them.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;g&rdquo; was the last letter to be drawn, and it was a headache, first he&rsquo;ve tried what seems logical to us a shape that was a &ldquo;q&rdquo; with a tail, but somehow with seemed that it didn&rsquo;t work, so we&rsquo;ve tried to do it in this way, any suggestions??!!!!, should we persue the this&quot;g&quot; or the other one???</p>
<p>Regarding the &ldquo;o&rdquo; we really like the &ldquo;openness&rdquo; of it, but we will try to balance it with the rest.</p>
<p>Thanks to all and keep on touch, we will be on workin.</p>
<p>Our best regards</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On the &lsquo;o&rsquo; and &lsquo;g&rsquo;; the &lsquo;o&rsquo; needs to be more square, basically like the &lsquo;c&rsquo; but closed off, so to speak. The same goes to the top of the &lsquo;g&rsquo;, it is too circular, it needs to be more angular to fit with the rest of the characters.
I also think the same could be said for the &rsquo;s'. While it is a rather nice &rsquo;s' on itself, I don&rsquo;t think it fits particularly well with the overall design. Just like the &lsquo;o&rsquo; and &lsquo;g&rsquo;, it is too smooth. Take a look at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/camingo/|Camingo]], or some of the other examples that have been mentioned, to see how these issues were solved.</p>
<p>The right stroke of the &lsquo;y&rsquo; seems to be too heavy. You have to turn this around, the left stroke should be the heavier one.</p>
<p>The ear of the &lsquo;r&rsquo; starts way to low in my opinion. This one seems to be made with a sliced off &lsquo;n&rsquo;, but really you should see it as a completely seperate shape. Take [[http://www.typeworkshop.com/type-basics/typebasics-17.jpg|this image]] as an example (exerpt from Underware&rsquo;s Type Basics). The ear of the &lsquo;r&rsquo; works best if it starts somewhere in the range 1/2 or 3/4 of the stem (so 2/3&rsquo;s could also work, etc.).</p>

<p>To my point of view your o is&rsquo;nt open, it&rsquo;s even a bit close compare to the p which one is open. Other thing is the horizontal bar in the m, n, u, I would reduce the thickness a little to avoid to get something too black between the stem and the join.</p>
