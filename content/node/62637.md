  own name:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/matthew_ambi_6484.jpg]\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  it'd be more fun to challenge each other with a word (or two words) and continue
  the challenge in this thread. Who's got a suggestion for the first ambigram?\r\n\r\nThe
  second challenge should be issued by anyone who can complete the first challenge"

    how do we start? There was once a 'Typophile'/'Typography' ambigram challenge.
    Perhaps, we could use some other words, or maybe a theme..?\r\n\r\nOur suggestion
    is - to make it open and relevant to this site - to come up with an ambigram from
    a type/font. John Langdon had done a 'Helvetica' ambigram, maybe we avoid that.
    The others are fair game..?\r\n\r\nWhat's your take?  \r\n\r\nnagfa"

    easily when we know what we expect it to say: the more familiar a word or phrase
    it generally looks like, the more liberties we're prepared to overlook; if what
    it actually says is something we're <em>not</em> expecting or familiar with, it's
    harder. "
