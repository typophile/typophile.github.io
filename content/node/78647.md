  Conference http://www.mjconference.org. Their goal is to disassemble stereotypes
  and prejudices between the muslim and jewish people\u2014which I think is a very
  noble goal. They started out last year and need some help with their online and
  print appearance. Since I have nearly no knowledge of typefaces I need your help.
  \r\n\r\nThe typeface should\u2026\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>handle big chunks of text;</li>\r\n<li>go
  along nicely with the logo (that was there already)</li>\r\n<li>maybe have a web
  version of it too</li>\r\n<li>and most importantly it must work for a very diverse
  audience.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nMaybe someone here can point me to the right direction.
  I look forward to your answers.\r\n\r\nAll the best \u2013\r\nFerdinand"
