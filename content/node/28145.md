  I can't locate the original thread. But there was a fellow looking for a specimen.
  If he could contact me off list I have since located a printed specimen of the complete
  character set printed at 72-pt. These are reproductions from letterpress printed
  sheets so there is some outline disturbance. I will scan these in the next several
  days.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\nhttp://BielerPress.blogspot.com"

  body: Peter Enneson has an interest in the Raffia Initials, and has written quite
    extensively on them and presented a talk on the subject at ATypI 2003 in Vancouver.
    I've alerted him to this thread, but I think what he is seeking is specimens of
    them in use, rather than a type specimen, which I'm sure he has.

  body: "Doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nRights to the typeface are owned by Linotype, but nothing
    digital has been released. VGC released poor quality typositor strips, but prior
    to that it was only electrotype, hence metal. Master drawings (Henk Krijger) are
    in the University of Amsterdam special collections. \r\n\r\nBy the way, if anyone
    can connect me with someone owning a strip (or metal sorts for that matter, I'd
    be grateful.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"
