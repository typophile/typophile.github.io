  type a \"c\" in Word with a grave accent and the character simply isn't recognized.
  The type is Times New Roman (and I tried Helvetica Neue for kicks) and to no avail.\r\n\r\nIs
  this even a recognized character typically? It is the final letter of a last name
  belonging to a Croatian young man, to whom I am attributing an essay, hence my need.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What language would that be for?  I did a search on a letter database site
    and it was not listed under any languages there.\r\nAlso a lot of the older Microsoft
    fonts don't have extended character sets. If you have some of the Adobe fonts
    that come with apps such as the creative suites you can get extended language
    coverage, but I'd still doubt a cgrave would be included."

  body: "It seems that it will take some time for all the capabilities of Unicode
    to make it into common use. What's needed involves (a) operating systems, (b)
    applications program, (c) and fonts.\r\n\r\nI do know that what you want to do
    is easy enough with Windows Vista, running either Wordpad, Notepad, Open Office
    3.01 (free) or MS Word in the newer releases.\r\n\r\nI do not know about Macs,
    nor have I tested Windows XP -- at least, not lately.\r\n\r\nOK, that's operating
    systems and applications programs.  The font people have dragged their feet. Fortunately,
    SIL Charis (free & a pretty good typeface for writing manuscripts) has all the
    combining diacritics encoded. The combining diacritics really are needed with
    the Unicode system.\r\n\r\nSo, I know the following will work, with Windows Vista,
    Open Office (& Wordpad & Notepad & some releases of Word), and the font Charis:\r\n\r\nType
    a \"c.\" (Make sure the \"num lock\" is \"on.\") Now, hold down the \"Alt\" key,
    and with it held down, using the number keypad, enter the string 0300 (Unicode
    for combining grave accent). release the \"Alt key.\"\r\n\r\nThe above paragraph
    is simply one way of directly entering a Unicode character from the keyboard with
    a Windows program. Likely there is a corresponding way to do so with a Mac. If
    you're using a Mac, you can test things out as well. It is easier if you can eliminate
    one of the potential problem areas, so start with a font that has the combining
    accents completed, and maybe even good *mark* and *mkmk* features, such as Charis.\r\n\r\nIn
    sum, the font Charis is free (search for \"download Charis\") The Open Office
    products are free, and can even write off a .doc format. (Search for Open Office).
    For operating system support & upgrade, you're on your own.\r\n\r\nGood Luck,\r\n\r\nCharles"

    Phonetic Alphabet</a>). The keyboard is also available for Windows and Linux but
    I have never tried it on those platforms.\r\n\r\nTo type c with a grave accent
    with the IPA-SIL keyboard, just type c and then SHIFT 4 (c with acute is c SHIFT
    2). You can switch fast between the American keyboard and the IPA keyboard by
    just typing \"apple space\". \r\n\r\nWith Word 2008 for the macintosh, what I
    just described works fine with the Microsoft Calibri and Cambria fonts but not
    with Times New Roman; <a href=\"http://www.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software_catalog.asp?by=cat&name=Font\"><strong>SIL

    will notice Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Sun, and others.\r\n\r\nIsn't it sad
    that support of accented characters, a part of the Unicode Standard, isn't (yet)
    much supported?\r\n\r\nAll James wants to do is enter one character with an accent.
    It looks like the occurrence of this character is one time. He shouldn't need
    a special keyboard. (There are numerous languages where the isn't a special keyboard
    available.) If the fonts (from Adobe, from Microsoft) have combining diacritics,
    he should be able to directly enter the base character and the accent, if the
    applications program (Microsoft) & operating system (Microsoft, Apple, Sun,) allow/help/don't
    get in the way."
