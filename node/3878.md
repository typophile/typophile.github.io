body: ' Adobe sells large sets of OTF files containing multiple font weights, widths
  and styles. When you install these fonts they appear under one menu name, e.g.,
  Caslon, and the family members appear on a sub menu in InDesign, or in the case
  of Mac OS X TextEdit, the Font Panel groups them under one family and lists the
  various faces in the TypeFace column. <BR> <BR>How do you name a set of fonts to
  get this to happen? <BR> <BR>For example, assuming: <BR> <BR>BulmerGoldfinch-Roman
  <BR>BulmerGoldfinch-Italic <BR>BulmerGoldfinch-Titling <BR>BulmerGoldfinch-Ornaments
  <BR> <BR>What values are the same in each font and what values are different? '
