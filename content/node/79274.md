body: "Hello all!\r\nThis is a txt face that I have been working on for quite some
  time now. I was inspired by large families like Scala and Nexus and wanted to create
  something kind of like that. So I created this and *legibell trnsprt (can be found
  under critique > sans). My goal is to create a nice, readable, unique serif font
  possibly for the screen. All the kerning and spacing is not sorted out yet; I just
  really wanted some feedback on the look and design of it. \r\n\r\nAny critique or
  commentary would be great! Thanks,\r\n\r\n"
