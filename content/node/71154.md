body: When converting the dotlessi to small caps, what is substituted for it? Would
  I make a glyph called Dotlessi.sc that looks exactly like a plain I.sc? so that
  when it returns, it returns dotless?

  body: "Arno,\r\n\r\nI started the thread in 2006 when I knew almost nothing. Now
    that it is 2010, I think I am beginning to forget everything. Rereading all that
    stuff helped!\r\nThe reason I brought up this again this time is that I am going
    back and creating an encoding to standardize everything from now on including
    my older fonts. This way, I can create a more efficient workflow that reuses modular
    items such as opentype classes, feature script, and kerning set-up tests samples.
    Now that I have dozens of fonts in the works, I can no-longer do the hodgepodge
    of variations I started with 6 years ago when I was just a beginner."
