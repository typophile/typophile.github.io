		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure about this one, although in general I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Jeremy&rsquo;s work and think he is consistently interesting and creative in how he thinks about letters. I understand what he is doing in Fenland, but it seems to be unevenly successful: some letters look great as a result of the system he has applied, but others seem to me awkward; some look like novel constructions of real strength while others look like distressed letters (in part, I suspect, because they end up reminiscent of postmodernist experiments of the 1990s; this is especially the case with B D E). The construction of the N  obliges this to become a very wide letter: the first thing that jumped out at me about the design.</p>
<p>Overall, I think the lowercase is more successful than the caps, with which they don&rsquo;t seem to combine very naturally. I can&rsquo;t help feeling that the lowercase would work better alongside more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; caps that don&rsquo;t draw so much stylistic attention to themselves. Or maybe the family would benefit from a distinction between display caps and text caps.</p>
<p>Lowercase v w x y seem to me awkward and, like the caps, not entirely in keeping with the rest of the lowercase. They give the appearance of needing to be strangely constructed in order to fit with the programme, instead of having a shape that balances well with the other letters. The thought I&rsquo;m left with is that systematic programmes of &lsquo;norm violation&rsquo;—to use Peter Enneson&rsquo;s phrase in a situation in which I think it is particularly useful—need to be flexible when applied to letters whose inherited construction is itself outside of the norms of the rest of the alphabet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think it is &lsquo;awesome&rsquo; that people are thinking about how to create viable letterforms whose edge-to-edge relationships are other than those derived from writing tools, and are trying to do so in systematic ways that apply across entire typefaces. I don&rsquo;t think all the results are awesome, but I appreciate the thoughtful approach to this question in type design, and I think the results tell us important things even when, as in the case of Fenland, I don&rsquo;t personally think the results are wholly successful. Fenland seems to me to demonstrate the limits of systematic programmes—or at least of this systematic programme—, particularly with regard to certain letters. Among other thoughts, this is going to send me back to look at Legato to examine more closely how Evert adapted his own systematic approach to the letters comprised of diagonal strokes.</p>
<p>I also think it is awesome, in the full sense of the word, that Hrant and Nick agree about something.</p>

It somehow has a very even colour when used small, whereas it may look a bit too willfully peculiar using large sizes.

<p>One should mention that this typeface, though it&rsquo;s apparent divorce from conventional structure, still has a strong chirographic affinity. The ductual logic is just reversed.</p>
<img src=http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/2/9/3262384/no.jpg width="500" height="316">
<p>There are places where the designer deviates from this system, as can be seen in the circled area, at joints. Certainly, this is consciously designed to avoid black spots, and for that: &ldquo;chapeau!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What bothers me is that, on the other hand, there are letters that seem not to follow any system at all (e.g. /t/, /N/), which was John&rsquo;s point. This is why I personally don&rsquo;t regard this as a very successful design, and also why I doubt Jeremy was concerned with notan (at all) as Evert was when designing Legato. What I like is what also John has already expressed best: I look at Fenland as an eye-opening way of thinking; inciting designers to assent to other kind of shapes different from those derived from the humanist hand.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As JT says on his site: “The modern shapes are constructed and balanced to remove the adherence to the pen-written or calligraphic model. Yet still provide an alphabet that maintains a lively pattern when set in continuous text.”<br>
(And, “The visual uniqueness of Fenland becomes apparent when it is seen at large sizes”.)</p>
<p>That’s all that can be said, other than post facto rationizations.
I would imagine that he began with a vague idea of how an effect might be applied, in design and style, to the alphabet, according to the concept of divergent outlines, and then worked out what that would look like by a proceess of glyph-drawing. Trial and error, adapting each individual glyph to theme and sub-theme en masse, and redefining the themes too, in feedback loops. The hands-on practicality of a looping process that involves so much drawing would see to it that any “system” that emerged would have its inconsistencies.</p>
<p>But why put so much store on systemic consistency? Beyond the initial concept, type design is an agglomeration of “cheats” to counteract various optical effects.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&lsquo;Systematically structured&rsquo; is one of the adjectival phrases in the Fenland specimen, and perhaps the one I picked up on instinctively. Jeremy&rsquo;s list of &lsquo;further reading references is also instructive, citing both modernist texts and examples of prior efforts at systematic programmes in type design, notably Excoffon&rsquo;s Antique Olive.</p>
<p>It is not that I am putting so much store on systemic consistency, but that it seems to me that Jeremy has, and I think sometimes too much, to the detriment of some letters and the relationship between the upper- and lowercase alphabets.</p>

But I always take a designer’s theory and rationale with a pinch of salt (my own with several pinches).</p>
<p>**
It seems to me that JT’s decision to give the lower case an asymmetric ductus, while the upper case get symmetry, is systematic, in the sense that this treatment is applied consistently. It has also been used many times before, most notably in Times (C and c, but not S and s).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m also a fan of Tankard&rsquo;s work, but I don&rsquo;t think this one is a success. Even with such quirky shapes he is able to pull off pretty even color in the lower case. As a feat of craft that is pretty impressive. But the characters are ungainly and awkward, and as John pointed out, the caps aren&rsquo;t particularly coherent as a design. I just don&rsquo;t see how this is going to be used successfully.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really like the concept! Glad to see someone stick their neck out a bit and design something with guts.
I have tried some of those things and know how both exciting and maddening it can be.  I will have to give it a while to simmer before I can comment because you need to realign your habitual vision a bit to be fair.<br>
I am really rooting for Jeremy on this one! 
At the moment, the counterforms seem to need to be pushed more in opposition to the norm to solidify the vision that this is a purposive departure.  I am sure Jeremy will get [and has gotten] plenty of notes of caution and requests to keep closer to traditional models. I hope he ignores all of it and follows his own vision.
He mentions abandoning pen based forms as a starting point. This is a good way to try to see the pure form without diluting it with tradition. That does not mean that I think &ldquo;THe Pen&rdquo; is wrong or even to be avoided.  It means to me that I prefer not to either reject totally or embrace totally any means.  To me, it means letting go of preconditioned axioms and having a visual dialogue with the forms in front of you and letting them each speak their own form of diction. Calligraphy has its own form of diction which has hundreds of years of evolution.  That does not mean it is either good or bad.  It is like the difference between French and German diction.  Neither one is wrong and neither one is right.  Each is a working system that differing peoples have arrived upon.  There is no need to stop looking for new diction as befits our current time.  The generations before us did not stop, nor should we.
You go Jeremy! Take your own Pinta, Niña,and Santa Maria to the New World!</div>

And that’s no small achievement! The purpose of a typeface is to make us read, not to “look closely to notice anything new or different”. What’s interesting here is the mean used to achieve this.

<p>I actually quite like the y and the v.  There are some brilliant moments here, for sure.
I think what put me off is that at book-size point sizes, it really looks just like a plain old regular sans.  You would have to look closely to notice anything was new or different about it.  Of course that probably wouldnt be said of the people who post here, as they are so intune with fonts and letters.  But I would think almost anyone else wouldn&rsquo;t even notice there was something new or unusual about this font at 10 point, and there is nothing that waves a flag and says, &ldquo;come on, look closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why is it awesome that he (quite skilfully) created letters that cannot be drawn with the pen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well now this is the future of fonts of course.  We have had hundreds of years of calligraphic inspired letters.  Is there really that much left to explore in the genre?  Seems to me that in order to make true progress we must leave the pen behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hands-on practicality of a looping process that involves so much drawing would see to it that any “system” that emerged would have its inconsistencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes. This makes me really want to start exploring Python with Fontlab.  It would be very interesting to design a system purely in code and have it tackle the letter shapes.  A font created 100% from the command line.  Very interesting, indeed.</p>

<p>That is a an incredibly valid point of view, one which I admire greatly. I am still in the process of trying to reconcile it with my own muse. I know in my mind that you are right, but I know in my heart that I love beautiful forms that draw just a bit of attention to themselves.  I guess that is the curse of being a type designer, not that I really am one, yet.</p>

<p>Or, alternatively, pick up the pen again (or some other tool). Noordzij makes this point in <em>Types Best Remembers / Types Best Forgotten</em>: the freezing of letters in their typographic norms that took place in the second half of the 15th Century is an anomaly in the history of writing, in which the invention and proliferation of new styles is the norm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in both approaches: how to design convincing types freed from tool derived models and the invention of new tool derived models. Oh yes, and after all these years I am also still interested in the old tool derived models.</p>

<p>Chris, you&rsquo;re right that we can learn a lot from experiments that don&rsquo;t fully succeed. And it&rsquo;s great that Jeremy Tankard has the energy to do both more conventional typefaces and more experimental ones. I just don&rsquo;t think that this one works very well. And it seems to me that difficulty of making more radical experiments work is greater in type than in say painting or even architecture.</p>

What you might call extreme innovations do not have to work perfectly in and of themselves.  It is like test firing an artillery round. You first have to fire one long to see the target.
The danger to me is that if we signal so strongly that the only way to proceed is by bringing one grain of sand at a time that we will stifle those who would be willing to fire one long. Don&rsquo;t worry, the sand grain pilers will still be able to proceed as always.  They may even be able to see that signal flare fired ahead of them in time to speed up their own work ;-)</div>

So you can do new stuff as well with different aesthetics that also hit the sweet spot. Further, at larger sizes and shorter texts the demands of readability are more forgiving, and in many uses aesthetics is more important than optimum readability. Thus there is great scope for variations in fonts for headlines, signage, advertising, sidebars etc. etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Be aware of the distinction between process and result. I think Nick is right when he says ‘Fenland advances the investigation of ourselves, our tools, our culture’ insofar as this statement applies to the design process. I think Bert may be right that the <em>result</em> will end up being a ‘novelty type’: not necessarily because of the shapes themselves, but because that is how the graphic design business digests the unusual. In the case of Fenland, I think this digestion will be aided by the stand-out letters that I think are problematic, precisely because they do stand out.</div>

<p>I am not the least bit insecure about my taste or &ldquo;good stuff&rdquo; and do not find this approach &ldquo;Novelty&rdquo; any more than Columbus&rsquo;s voyage across the Atlantic was a novelty. If a person wants to stay safe from the possibility of criticism of their work, it is quite easy.  They can just tinker with what has already been done by the now safely admired and numerous times repeatedly praised masters of the past.  I have no problem with that.  Do what ever pleases you.  The problem I have is that those locked safely in the boundaries of past models of &lsquo;good&rsquo; stuff should not ridicule those who choose to do things their own way.  If you want to sail your model boat safely in your bathtub, away from storms, currents, and reefs, fine. If that does not give you a superiority complex over those who venture further, fine. But do not point to the numerous safe voyages you have made across your bath tub as evidence of your superiority as a sailor of the real seas you fear too much to sail. How easy it is to align yourself with the historic masters you can safely emulate and thereby equate yourself with them.  Those historic masters whom you emulate were once the explorers of the high seas.  Years later, after the jury of hundreds of years of history has anointed them Masters, you are now safe to say, &ldquo;see, my stuff looks like theirs so it must be &lsquo;good&rsquo; stuff.  No one is asking you to take the unknown voyage, certainly not those who do.  If your guilt of playing it safe controls you, then you have no choice but to heap ridicule on those who would take the risk. That way, you take the attention away from your own performance anxiety.
No one is saying that Fenland is the greatest success and should now be emulated by all the lemmings.  If you fear risk, do not mock those who take risk.  You need not even praise them, just let them do what they choose without blame.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Like people have already said, I think the lower case is good - the f in particular is very interesting - but the uppercase isn&rsquo;t doing it for me. With regards to the curves wrapping around the inside, this seems to fall apart a bit in the corners of letters like E, L, F etc. The rounded inside corner doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me, and doesn&rsquo;t fit with the thinking behind the lower case. Perhaps big ink traps or just &lsquo;normal&rsquo; corners would have been better. I do think it will be successful though. It has the weirdness factor that magazine editors go for. An acquired taste, perhaps, but one that will be easily acquired when you see it used more often.</div>

Well, I’m not particularly interested in conceptualizing type designs around the issue of “the stroke” as it relates to the relationship between inside and outside edges.
Recently I’ve been exploring contextuality and unicase, which more concern overall letter shape.
I’m quite happy to occupy the fringe, leaving others to “get most jobs done”.</p>
<p>Actually, I did have a go at a type along vaguely similar lines to Fenland, Artefact. 
<img src="/images/old-images/Vaneigem1_4361.jpg" alt="">
At the time I rationalized it as a deconstruction of the didone genre. Today I might frame it differently—as a displacement of notan designed to coarsen text, thereby optimizing disﬂuency, according to the recently proposed scientiﬁc theory that “Hard-to-Read-Fonts Promote Better Recall”.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don’t see the primary characteristic of Fenland in any of Jocham’s types, his concern in the sans being primarily with letter shape. Only a few have an irregular stroke, and in those it follows the nib ductus with correspondingly stressed contrast at a consistent angle, throughout the face. Contra Sans, thus, with a similar premise to Amira.</p>
<p>Fenland is calligraphically informed, but by being deliberately disﬂuent in that respect, with both traditional “right-handed” and “left-handed” (ﬂipped) stress (angle of contrast) exhibited in the same glyph. That’s the difference. As a calligrapher, I can imagine/feel making Contra or Amira with a pen nib, the kind of manipulations it would require (and that’s part of the pleasure of admiring those faces). But looking at Fenland I feel bewilderment at the difficulty of making its strokes.</p>
<p>That’s not a revolutionary idea, as JT admits with his bibliography, and as has been discussed re. Legato at Typophile, but it goes beyond purely formal invention to address the fundamental structure of the contrasted, pen-informed stroke and its relationship to the reading process. How many types do that?</p>

<p>Absolutely wrong, but I can see why you might think that. This, alas, is not the place to explain myself. I’ll just say that these days total moral or aesthetic relativity* falls straight into the hands of the totalitarian corporate <i>system</i> (not government or leader, as with its opposame fascism) we all live under.</p>
<p>And bid you a friendly adieu.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Stephen Coles writes the following of Fenland in Print magazine April issue:</p>
<blockquote>It isn't often that a new typeface challenges the basic principles of how letters are made. Jeremy Tankard attempted just that with Fenland (2012), a sans serif that imagines what the alphabet would look like if it had no roots in calligraphic form - if it had been constructed rather than written. The result is quite unusual: lines are thick where we are used to seeing them thin and vice versa. Fenland isn't necessarily beautiful, but it's still quite readable and usable, uniquely suitable attire for text that defies conventions. </blockquote>
