    that Moscow face, altho I like it! Will the new improved fontshop.com have a similar
    feature?\r\n\r\nI actually think it's a little bit of font overkill myself. Altho
    I like most of their choices."

  body: A lot of improvements are in the pipeline and already on staging servers here
    at FontShop, but Whatthefont is MyFonts' greatest feat of engineering and I don't
    think anyone will match it anytime soon.

  body: Headline looks like Gotham outlined, yes. I'm not sure on the text - it's
    awfully small. Has elements of Baskerville but the f looks wrong. Anyway it's
    probably a pretty standard text font.
