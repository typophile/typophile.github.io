  I've found Martina which looks right but I need to be able to buy a version of it
  for work rather than a 'free' site.\r\nThanks\r\nJay"

  body: "Updated: \r\nMartina, which dates from the early 1990s, is apparently based
    on the photo-lettering era Filmotype Hudson. Some letters in Martina like _E_
    \ and perhaps _A_ were alt letters in the Filmotype Hudson filmstrips. The alt
    _E_ is found in the digital Filmotype Hudson as an alt _E_, but it does not include
    an alt _A_ like the one in Martina. The Martina _A_ is either an alt _A_ that
    was in the filmstrips and was missed in the Filmotype digitization, or was created
    by editing _a_ when the digital Martina was made.\r\nDon"

  body: "Updated:\r\nThere is also a font called Hudson which has the same _A_ as
    Martina, but the links from Identifont don't work. See http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Hudson&q=Go\r\nDon't
    know if this was pulled from sale because of legitimacy issues.\r\nHudson is currently
    offered for sale as a FontSite Font. Again, I am not clear as to whether there
    are legitimacy issues.\r\nFurther Update:\r\nI checked both digital Martina and
    FontSite digital Hudson. The Digital outlines, node positions etc. are virtually
    identical so one is a clone of the other. Identifont states a 1992 copyright for
    Hudson by The Font Company. Internal information on the Hudson font now being
    sold by FontSite claims a copyright of 1996. Internal information on Martina claims
    copyright 1990-1993 FontBank, Inc. I have no idea which dates reflect reality
    and who copied whom.\r\nDon"

  body: "Recommendation. If you want to purchase a font with clear legitimacy, get
    Filmotype Hudson. If you want the rounded _A_ it's fairly simple to make. In any
    case, the quality is much better than Martina/Hudson.\r\nDon"
