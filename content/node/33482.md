  body: "'totally vegetarian' seems to be a font, and I was trying to find it among
    the new scripts at Veer, but so far I have had no luck. I also checked the Antique
    handwriting fonts in the Script Font ID Guide, but no match there either.\r\n\r\nI'll
    be interested to see this answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
