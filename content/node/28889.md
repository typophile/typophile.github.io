  Roman characters. Here is one sample I found to be quite nice. I am wondering if
  this is a custom font, or one completely done custom?

    match. <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/catharsis-bedouin.font?nb_ppp=20&text=Lupe+Fiasco\">Catharsis
    Bedouin</a> is one that's free. Linotype has one called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pide-nashi/\">Pide
    Nashi</a> that also has a similar feel, and I think Scriptorium also has several
    faux Arabic fonts, with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/serendib/\">Serendib</a>
    as the closest style in their collection to your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: chuck (nopattern, the designer of the cover) has once posted on a closed forum
    that the type was given to him by the label, so the chance of it being custom
    is there i'd say. writing him an email would maybe give you more information than
    waiting for an answer here.

  body: Funny I just went thru an exhaustive search for a roman font with an arabic
    feel - ended up using ITC Braganza which is a little less kitsch than the samples
    above but still has a calligraphic flair.

  body: well apparently, when you go to the nopattern website... you will see that
    the cover art and type was created by rostarr... http://www.rostarr.com/ who is
    an amazing artist. He recently had a showing with the Black Market Gallery and
    much of his work is Asian/Arabic calligraphy infused... thanks for the head's
    up!
