body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI would like to ask for some suggestions about font
  management tools for Mac OS X. It might sound rude for someone but I find Suitcase
  slow (not to mention its constant intension to freeze), Fontbook quite useless (If
  I deactivate the font I would like to have it deactivated, right?). I've also heard
  that Adobe canceled ATM's further development. \r\n\r\nDo you have any other suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMatjaz\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW
  \r\nHas anyone experienced Linotype FontExplorer X already?\r\n \r\n\r\n "

  body: Have you tried Font Agent. I don't like the fact that there is a (font activator)
    daemon running at all times but it hasn't crashed on me yet. I use it in conjunction
    with "Font Doctor"

  body: Yeah, I've used FontAgent Pro and FontExplorer X. They both are nice. Go with
    FE X if price is an issue.

    out I never looked back.\r\n\r\nThe only problem I have with Font Explorer X is
    that it doesn't seem to like Quark. Which is fine with my, because I don't like
    Quark either."
