  to accompany a song I released, but saved the image as a png and have forgotten
  the font. There are many similar fonts, but the matches suggested on various font
  ID websites did not have the same apostrophe. Any help would be appreciated."

  body: "Fivos I agree with the modification idea. Looking at the letters I am struck
    by the inverse contrast -- the vertical strokes are thinner than usual when compared
    to the horizontal strokes. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FranciscosSM_6675.jpg]
    This suggests that the letters could the result of horizontal compression of a
    font. Perhaps one that looked something like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Franciscosheight85pctSM_4765.jpg]\r\nBut
