  telephone is. \r\nSought of similar to Avenir light, but I am pretty sure it isn't,
  looks a little lighter? \r\nAnyone know the exact font. Business Card ID and design
  by Superfamous\u2122. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    "is" truely geometric?

    ha\") that you should mention that, David. I was just reading about Paul Renner's
    \"original\" Futura in both <em>Letters of Credit</em> and <em>Detail in typography</em>.
    I don't have either book in front of me right now, but both mentioned Renner's
    early talents of drawing geometrically as in the design of <a href=\"http://www.designingwithtype.com/items/itemsFutura.html\"
    target=\"new\">\"original\" Futura</a>. What saved Futura for all time was the
    redrawing to appear \"geometric\" and simplifying the letterforms.\r\n"

    seems to be a reasonably bad reproduction of the origina, where as the one used
    on the RED, inc. card seems 'truly geometric' and perfectly kerned! Beautiful!!"
