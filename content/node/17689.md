  c\r\n\r\nmiddle: b\r\n\r\nI have checked my only native American specimen book,
  the big ATF 1924, and most of the cent signs seems to sit on the baseline. But the
  signs on page 595 and 616 shows the cent sign on position a, with a long strike
  to the baseline like a fraction.\r\n\r\nTo my eyes I would always prefer placing
  on top like example a. But most text fonts I have checked now use position c and
  b. The baseline placement seems to me most uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nSo my question
  as font developer: Speeks anything against the top placment (a) as default position
  for the cent sign in a typeface? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cent.png]\r\n\r\nexample

  body: "Andreas, that isn't a florin in the maths setting, it's the MATHEMATICAL
    ITALIC SMALL F character (U+1D453).\r\n\r\nThe florin, very unfortunately, is
    unified with LATIN SMALL LETTER F WITH HOOK (U+0192) which is a letter in the
    orthographies of a sizeable number of African languages. It is very difficult
    to support both these languages and the (until recent) European use of this character
    as a currency symbol. The currency symbol was almost always slanted, even in roman
    typefaces, and conformed to the proportions (including, often, tabular numeral
    width) of other currency symbols. The actual letter, of course, needs to conform
    to the overal style of the typeface and to fit to the other letters. An added
    challenge is designing an italic typeface in which one needs to distinguish between
    the letter <em>f,</em> often stylistically drawn with a descending hook, and the
    letter \u0192."

    usually make it slightly shorter than the lowercase c, and usually quite a lot
    lighter, but aligned within the x-height, with the bar extending above and below
    what seems an optically pleasing amount. This seems to me the best way to produce
    a single cent glyph that works reasonably well with lining numerals as well as
    oldstyle numerals. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JHcent.gif]\r\nSince
    the cent sign is so seldom used, I'm not inclined to spend time making variant
    versions for use with different kinds of numerals, but if I were to make a version
    specifically for use in e.g. all-caps settings with lining numerals, then I might
    make something like in your Adobe Minion example."

  body: "In my humble and personal opinion, the type designer's own intent for the
    use of the typeface should take precedence over conventional presets or attempts
    at standardization. Not that standardization is to be avoided, but character design
    and their placement should be guided by the overall intent or personality of the
    type family.\r\n\r\nTake for instance the identical treatment and placement of
    the cent sign in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bell-mt/regular/\"
    target=\"new\">Monotype Bell</a> (though Linotype version illustrated) and Futura.
    Note that the Bell numerals are based on the original lining numerals of Richard
    Austin's late eighteenth century design which are smaller than the caps and larger
    than the lowercase.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bell-numerals.png]\r\nBoth
    cent signs are equal to the x-height and sit on the baseline.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Futura-numerals.png]\r\nThough
    I don't have a copy of Paul Renner's original placement of the cent sign at hand,
    I personally would have placed it higher. The cent sign in Bell has the privilege
    of being used with unique sized lining figures, and looks quite comfortable where
    it is.\r\n\r\nAs a typographer, I have developed certain personal \"style guide\"
    preferences, and would almost never use regular dollar or cent signs juxtaposed
    to old style numerals. For me, lining figures are for expressing math, money and
    measurements (temperature, inches, cm, gals., etc.) and old style figures are
    used for dates, and numeric expressions within text (<em>The detective was looking
    for Rm. 38</em>).\r\nOf course, I'm always willing to break my own rules for good
    reason.\r\n\r\n"
