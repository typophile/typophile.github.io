  doing a school project on the factors that influence the choice of a typeface. Robert
  Bringhurst, in his book The Elements of Typographic Style, refers to:\r\nTechnical
  considerations, Consider the medium for which the typeface was originally designed;\r\nPractical
  typography, Choose faces that suit the task as well as the subject;\r\nHistorical
  considerations, Choose a face whose historical echoes and associations are in harmony
  with the text;\r\nCultural & Personal considerations; Choose faces whose individual
  spirit and character is in keeping with the text.\r\n\r\nMichael Bierut, in his
  famous essay 'thirteen ways of looking at a typeface', considers more subjective
  reasons like 'because it's beautiful', 'because it's ugly', 'because it's boring',
  etc.\r\n\r\nSome designers, truly have a fascination with only one typeface and
  throughout their work they only use a very small selection of typefaces. \r\n\r\nI
  could enumerate many more reasons or examples but I don't want to limit or condition
  your answers. What do you considerer when choosing a typeface? \r\n"

  body: "I was a heavy user before becoming a manufacturer, and I would imagine that
    most type designers have some experience as working typographers.\r\n\r\nCertainly,
    many of the factors above influenced me, to which I would add licensing considerations
    (under \u201Cpractical\u201D).\r\n\r\nOften typographers use types which are trendy,
    betting on a proven thing, as it were, and it\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s popular
    by going to the best seller lists at online resellers such as FontSpring and MyFonts.\r\n\r\nBut
    ultimately, you\u2019ve got to go with your gut.\r\nAs Jane Hope put it:\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m
    not a big believer in rationalizing. The way something comes to life through design,
    every designer has a personal attitude. Rationalization is only as strong as the
    design\u2019s credibility.\u201D"

  body: The opinions of the end users (the target audience) must be considered. What
    are they used to? What will they like? What will they hate? Bringhurst is implying
    this in the first post, but I wanted to say it straight out.
