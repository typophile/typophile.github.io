  and http://typophile.com/node/52116. Thanks everyone for all the input, it helped
  me a lot to decide which direction to take.\r\n\r\nThe color treatment is still
  being decided upon, but the the concept and the actual wordmark have been finalized:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dark-on-light_3913.png]"

    stuff. I love these logo concepts that you look at and then you're like, \r\nwhy
    didn't I think of this earlier, this is so simple and cogent!"

    think you can use the mark itself without letters, because it will look like Cisco
    even more.\r\n\r\nCheck: [[http://www.techshout.com/images/cisco-logo.jpg|Cisco

  body: "Well, I am certainly familiar with Cisco logo, but it didn't occur to me
    to draw the parallels you are guys seeing. The above logo was an evolution of
    one of the earlier concepts, namely this one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/precision-early_4067.png]\r\n\r\n.\r\nOn
    the other hand, Cisco is not a bad association to have given the context :-)"

    So I don't think it relates to networking.\r\n\r\nI know Cisco could be a good
    mark to piggyback your own. But not in the same business. :)\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: This is a nice logotype. I don't feel it points to Cisco in any substantive
    fashion, and it says "networking" in a nice, understated way.

  body: Though you may want to tweak some of the kerning, particularly the R-K combination,
    and make sure that the hand drawn dashes in the E's align with the other character
    strokes.

    the logo was black, the \"scale\" concept may be even more obvious to some people.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I think this logo works well with pretty much every color scheme. Nice job.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

    before E and G being a bit too far to the left (rather than IN being too tight).
    Thanks, Craig and Nina.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if anyone's interested, [[http://www.precisionetworking.com|here's
    the logo in the context of a web page]]. It's not much at the moment, but it should
    give an idea of where it's going.\r\n"
