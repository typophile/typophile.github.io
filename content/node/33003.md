body: "Looking through French mathematics books from the 19th century, I see mostly
  this typeface. I assume it's a standard Didot, but it has a more gentle thick/thin
  contrast than any Didone I see today. Also, it has a contextual italic-lc \"v\",
  rounded at the beginning of words but pointed when alone, in equations, or within
  words. The particular sample in the picture also has a straight italic-lc \"f\"
  whereas one with a curved tail is the usual.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the sharp
  \"v\" was used regularly until about 1910. Here are my questions:\r\n\r\n1. What's
  the story on the sharp \"v\", that is, history and conventions of usage and why
  it ended?\r\n\r\n2. Is there a digitized version of this font that has the moderate
  thick/thin variation and the alternate \"v\"?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/didot_v_3739.JPG]"

    could be that the original page was set from a Greek or mathematics font, not
    from from a Latin font.  That would explain the different f, too.  Maybe the distinctions
    were lost over time.\r\n\r\nI found a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_%28letter%29\">Wikipedia
    page for nu</a>, and a a <a href=\"http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/03bd/index.htm\">Unicode

  body: "<em>I wonder whether this is not a v, but a lowercase Greek nu?</em>\r\n\r\nThat's
    a reasonable guess, but the texts do show show v, u, nu, and upsilon and they
    are quite distinct. The nu looks like the sharp v, but the left arm is angled
    out instead of in.\r\n\r\nCochin is interesting. According to Linotype's blurb,
    \"The Paris foundry Deberny & Peignot was the first to release this design in
    1912...This version was created in 1977 by Matthew Carter for Linotype.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    typface you see in the picture was used all through the 1800s. So, Deberny & Peignot
    created a modification of this 19th century face, then Carter created a 1970s
    interpretation of that. Carter's font is definitely for display.\r\n"

  body: "This is my analysis of the images:\r\n\r\nThe basic italic v in this typeface
    is the rounded form. This fits with the conventions of the period and the style.\r\n\r\nThe
    pointed form is a variant specifically for use in setting mathematics, where it
    can be used without fear of confusion with the Greek upsilon.\r\n\r\nThe use of
    the pointed v in the word 'positives' looks to me like an accident, although I
    suppose if it is used consistently in this way then some other pattern is at work."

    info I was looking for. The usage described above was the house style of <a href=\"http://www.association-gauthier.org/anglais/famous/Gauthier-Villars.html\"><em>Gauthier
    - Villars</em></a>.\r\n\r\nThey employed this style from at least 1864 to 1910
    and they accounted for the majority of math texts published in France during that
    period.\r\n\r\nYou can browse online scanned books by <a href=\"http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=01280002&seq=5\">Boussinesq</a>,
