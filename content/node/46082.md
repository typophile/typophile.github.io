  body: "I know only that Symie came later, designed by [[Morris Fuller Benton]] in
    1931.\r\n\r\nFrom MyFonts:\r\n\r\nThe original Rockwell was produced by the Inland
    typefoundry in 1910, which issued it as Litho Antique; American Type Founders
    revived the face in the 1920s, with Morris Fuller Benton cutting several new weights.\r\n\r\nThe
    Monotype Corporation produced its version of Rockwell in 1934; unfortunately,
    some of the literature erroneously referred to it as Stymie Bold, thereby creating
    confusion that still exists today.\r\n\r\nRockwell is a geometric slab serif design,
    a strong display face for headlines and posters; it is also legible in short text
    blocks."
