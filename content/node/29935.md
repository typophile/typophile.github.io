body: "G'day people, \r\n\r\nI'm desiging a layout for a textbook-type work and I
  want to use two serifs in the opening chapter pages (Janson text for body and Linotype
  Centennial for heads) for me it seems OK because the head and the body have a lot
  of space B/W them, for the intextheads I'm considering meta so there isn't that
  clash. What are your thoughts? Is it ever OK to mix serifs in this way, what do
  you think of my font-choice?\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: "If your designer's instinct is telling you that these fonts work well together
    as you intend to use them, and not that you like this one and that one so you're
    going to use both, then by all means, go for it.\r\n\r\nYour sample requires some
    sort of registration to view. "

  body: "Nicholas,\r\nIs it ever okay to mix two serifs? Yes. \r\nCan it be done without
    some consideration? No.\r\n\r\nThe contrast is hard to take in given the size
    differences. It will take someone with better eyes to tell you if they're working
    or not, but I can give you a bit of hope. For every rule concerning what can &
    can't or should & shouldn't be done with type, there are many exceptions. If you're
    interested and haven't already been through it, Bringhurst has a chapter on choosing
    & combining typefaces in <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>. In the forward
    to the book, RB writes \"By all means break the rules, and break them beautifully,
    deliberately, and well. That is one of the ends for which they exist.\" \r\n\r\nWhat
    is the font size for your body text by the way? Could just be my display or perhaps
    I'm just getting tired, but it's pushing the limits of legibility on my screen."
