  fashion & photography (mostly photography) and I'm hoping to get some feedback from
  you. My main concern is the kerning. I feel that the space around the \"I\" could
  use a little more work but I want a second (third, fourth...) opinion.\r\n\r\nFeel
  free to share any critique and thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ckgn_logo_6215.jpg]"

  body: "Nice type.\r\n\r\nWhy is the cut on the lower part of \"C\" different from
    all the other angular cuts? In my opinion at least \"C\" and \"G\" should match.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"i\" doesn't really work for me. Seems like it has a slightly different style
    then the rest. It might need a bit more space as well, it feels slightly crowded.\r\n\r\n\"K\"
    is very nice."

    \"G\" to match the one on the \"C\". I go \"blind\" sometimes.\r\n\r\nIncreased
    the space around the \"I\" and changed it slightly, seems to integrate better.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ckgn_logo_3490.jpg]"
