    numerous threads on Typophile about this subject before. Maybe you can find them
    using the search feature, or with Google."

    they only do it for the love of type and humanity!  Maybe typophiles are sitting
    in front of diamond studded macs and loungin' in a maxed out crib.  Who knows?\r\n\r\nER"

  body: "Edel, you have gleaned wrong! The people on this list who go on endlessly
    about how there  is no money in type design go on like that because they are the
    ones not making any. \r\n\r\nMost people on Typophile make their living as graphic
    designers and do some type for fun. I stopped doing graphic design in 1990. The
    only thing I do is type design, and while I do have a lot of fun, I do it for
    the money. It is a very interesting and well paid profession. \r\n\r\nIt is my
    belief that anyone who is not working full time as a type designer should keep
    their mouths shut about the difficulty in making money in the type business. How
    would they know, they are not in the type business.\r\n\r\nHappy now Chris?"
