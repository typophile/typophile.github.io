		<div class="commentbody">Agreed about the detail. I would make the pot smaller and the steam bigger. Also separate the icon, logo and phonetical spelling from the contact info as Nick said.

Is the black a working color or final? The black and white is not very appetizing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe try to remove the lid and make like two or three highly visible steam elements so you have a logo that can easily be reproduced. Furthermore I would really like to know more about the company. Thinking of clichés I would use red and yellow maybe a dark, not too highly saturated green if you want to emphazise the cafe.

Regarding to typography I'd reconsider the kerning of 'Cafe'. It looks very loose compared to 'Bouillabaisse'. Especially the 'C-a' feels a bit strange. Personally I think that the typeface works for the additional information but it doesn't do the trick for the company's name. It feels so constructed which conflicts with deli in some way.

Anyway, I do get some vibes from it but I think you can still improve your current approach.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">wow this site is amazing.  i'll definitely try out the suggestions later today.  

ken-really?  i dont understand why you think the booyabass needs to be associated with the secondary info, i think its successful as part of the logo typ

jayyy-the black and white is the working color, essentially bouillabaisse is a very low budget sandwich shop in east baltimore.  the only colors that they can afford and that are easiest for them to reproduce are black and white.  unless anyone has other suggestions of handling the money/color problem, i'm probably going to stick with the black and white and make it work.  a teacher of mine would always say that graphic design is all about problem solving, and i think the black and white is a problem that can be solved with some creativity and elbow grease.  thanks for your input, i'll definitely sit on your words 

simplicious-i'll try a revised version with variations of steam and post it up very soon.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This probably won't help, but I'm going to say that I really like the mark as-is. Yes, there could be an issue with printing it small. Maybe that needs to be addressed. But as it is here, I like it. The small wisp of steam is just right, IMHO.

Now, the type needs some work. I'm not getting a real sense of hierarchy on the card. Maybe try establishing the hierarchy with size rather than font-style?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I second the need to look at the hierachy, it seems a bit confused.
I like the name and the concept for the logo but the steam does seem a little of an afterthought, enlarge it or get rid of it entirely.
