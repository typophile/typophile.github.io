body: Continuing the &#34;things to do&#34; themes of a couple of recent threads,
  if you are in San Francisco for TypeCon you should visit the Asian Art Museum at
  200 Larkin Street across from City Hall. It houses the city&#39;s best collection
  of art.  <BR> <BR>You could even look me up in its publications department ...

  body: Hrant, who is always talking about Zoroastrianism, should like this object
    from the Asian&#39;s collection. It&#39;s an image of a Zoroastrian fire altar
    from the reverse side of a gold coin of emperor Bahram II &#40;276-293&#41;. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>&#62; You could even look me up <BR> <BR>Tom, so you&#39;re not coming
    to your own city&#39;s type conference? <BR>Or is it that you simply can&#39;t

  body: The best views night or day are from the top of Twin Peaks. It&#39;s one of
    the last places like this that you can still go to at midnight. You park along
    the road, then march up the stairs carved into teh hill to the top for unobstructed
    views from the sea to Mt. Diablo. It&#39;s even worth it when it&#39;s foggy.
    Plus it&#39;s free.

  body: Victor, thanks for the suggestion. <BR> <BR>Besides the city view from Twin
    Peaks that Mike mentions, another great view is from the Panoramic Highway in
    Marin County. I always recommend that visitors from out of town visit Muir Woods
    near there. <BR> <BR>Hrant, I don&#39;t think the bookstore is there at Ghiradelli
    any more. But despite the disastrous direction the book industry has taken in
    the past 20 years there are still a few good bookstores around the Bay Area, such
    as Black Oak, Cody&#39;s, Moe&#39;s, Green Apple, Diesel, City Lights, Book Passage,
    A Clean Well-Light Place, etc.

    a deification of the white parasol believed to protect all from harm. A white
    complexion, she bears the third eye, but has a peaceful demeanor. Her right hand
    is in abhaya mudra; her left hand carries the white parasol. A green halo is behind
    her head; a red halo with radiating gold lines encloses the body. She appears
    in a landscape of mountains, crags, &amp; waterfalls against ruyi clouds of Chinese
    origin. The painting is framed by meandering scrollworks of foliages, gold against

    extended, upon a sun disc above a lotus pedestal. A wrathful deity, blue in color,
