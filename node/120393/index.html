  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Whether you or your child were premature or simply were born with a few aesthetic birth defects, there are options to correct the malformation. A birth defect is nothing to be ashamed of, but if you are uncomfortable wearing it around every day or are self-conscious, surgery is an opportunity to feel better about your appearance. While some birth defects are easier to correct than others, plastic surgery is definitely something to consider. Research plastic surgery today to see what doctors can do for you.<p><p>

Cleft Lips<p><p>

Cleft lips or palettes are mouth deformations. The most common contribution to cleft lips is premature birth, as an early baby does not have time to complete the formation process of the face in the womb. Cleft lips can be subtle and require little to no outside help, or they can be sizable and very noticeable. For these deformations, plastic surgeons offer a way to cover up or reconstruct the lip to make it look more normal.

Facial Tumors<p><p>

A facial tumor occurs anywhere in the head and face area, giving a lump to the affected person. The tumors are benign, but they can cause much strife when it comes to looking and feeling appealing other people. To fix these tumors, doctors remove the tumor and use skin to cover and patch up the affected area. Facial tumors may take multiple surgeries to completely correct.<p><p>

Asymmetrical Lines<p><p>

Face aesthetics all comes down to symmetry. An asymmetrical face consists of one side being higher or lower than the other, giving an abnormal look. This kind of surgery is more extensive may require the breaking of facial bones in order to reconstruct a more even face. Healing takes awhile, but it is worth it for those who suffer from public ridicule or lack of self-confidence.<p><p>

Ear Malformations<p><p>

Ear malformations are more common than you might think. Ears can either be slightly damaged or significantly altered. Plastic surgery offers a means of correction by using skin from other parts of the body or face to stretch and smooth out the ear. Some ears are easily covered by hair or with makeup, but other deformations require more than a quick fix.<p><p>

Birth defects occur while in the womb and your problems with various defects can be helped by plastic surgeons. Beauty comes from within, but it is still important to feel confident in yourself. Take the time to look at surgery and the benefits you gain from it. You can discover more here by contacting Tampa Bay Plastic Surgery Inc or find out more here.<p><p></div>
