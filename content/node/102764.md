  same font as used on the 'McEwan's Export' logo but I'm drawing a blank! Anybody
  got any idea what this font is - or something really similar?\r\n\r\nCheers in advance
  :) "

    term) reason for the star (or any other kind of mark) under the c?

    all cap setting may be considered a form of \u201Clining\u201D, i.e. maintaining
    the visual effect of each character extending from baseline to cap line. It may
    perhaps also be considered a form of apostrophe\u2014indicating an elided character\u2014as

  body: "Thanks Nick, learn something new everyday. Lining seems like the clean tech
    term.\r\n\r\nBut... \r\n\r\nI heard a story of the origin of this mark. It had
    to do with Irish and Scottish families that wanted to leave their homeland and
    come to North America ...primarily through New York. As the story goes families
    could not all come over at once and knew that what little money they could gather
    up for the passage would be spent on the most likely family member to establish
    a foothold in America. \r\n\r\nFamily members within the same clan began to distinguish
    their own family's name by placing a mark under and sometimes above the c in Mc
    or ac in Mac.\r\n\r\nWhen families were reunited having all traveled to the new
    world the names could be recorded all together. And they could find each other
    via a registry.\r\n\r\nI forget where I heard that story."

  body: "Nick mentioned Flange as a similar font. \r\n\r\nIf McEwan is an old label
    it probably was hand lettering not a font. \r\n\r\nTo create letters from scratch
    that match, find a sans serif font with the right proportions and add mini-serifs
    to the letters. You may need to take letters from several different fonts. For
    a model of  mini-serifs that are close to the label check the serif contours in
    Flange, or ITC Serif Gothic Extra Bold, which you are likely to already have.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCSerifGothicExtraBold_3975.jpg]"
