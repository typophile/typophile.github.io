body: "Does anyone know of a list, ideally reasonably comprehensive and up to date,
  of fonts which incorporate optical scaling?  For present purposes I'd define this
  as fonts with three or more variants for different ranges of point size.  (There
  must be quite a lot more with just two variants, most often text and display versions.)\r\n\r\nI
  was asked this question by a colleague the other day, and on the spot could only
  respond with those I happened to know of already (the Adobe opticals as an obvious
  starting point, plus some others such as Cycles, Freight and Requiem).  But all
  attempts to build up a more systematic list haven't so far been a great success.
  \ MyFonts turns out to have an \"optical sizes\" tag, which currently returns 51
  hits (but with a bit of duplication, so the real number is less than 50).  However
  (a) there are plenty of foundries MyFonts doesn't handle - they do not sell Requiem,
  for instance - and (b) the tagging clearly isn't perfect: thus although Cycles is
  in the MyFonts database, it appears not to have the \"optical sizes\" tag and is
  not retrieved by the foregoing search!  So a better strategy is needed to come up
  with anything at all representative.\r\n\r\nIs a list of optically scaled fonts
  a possible topic for a Typowiki page?  There is an existing one on the principle
  of optical scaling, but it is very short on specifics.\r\n\r\nAlan\r\n"

  body: "I have several typefaces at MyFonts that are tagged \"optical sizes\", however
    I don't recall that as my tag, and most of them only have two optical sizes, \"normal\"
    and Display/Headline. (Scotch Modern and Walburn, and later this year Fontesque,
    have three.) \r\n\r\nAs William notes, Hairline and Ultra Thin sans fonts are
    to all intents and purposes display sizes, although the original principle of
    optical scaling (Hrant's \"...appear like the same typeface at different sizes...\")
    doesn't really apply. \r\n\r\nIt's difficult to keep track of any category if
    you don't mentally \"tag\" it immediately you see a new face, as there is now
    such a large number of typefaces being released every month.\r\nHow many?"
