    another sans could be like putting margarine and butter on the same piece of toast.\r\n\r\nIs
    futura condensed going to be for headers?"

  body: At the moment I'm using Futura BT medium for the body text at 8pt and bold
    for headers also at 8pt and I'm getting a nice result. I may well stick with Futura
    there are enough weights to carry it. Thanks guys I'll try to stick up the results
    for you to check out thanks for your help
