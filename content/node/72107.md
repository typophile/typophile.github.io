    but thanks anyway. Anyone else?

  body: "I think this is custom, probably based on an existing typeface. Does not
    look very elaborate to me. Here are some more samples:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aiso-1_5429.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/aiso-2_4248.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/aiso-3_6174.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/aiso-4_3465.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/aiso-5_3963.png]"

  body: AZ Fonts is not a good place to look for fonts, with lots of illegal free
    fonts. Better check MyFonts, Fonts.com, Linotype, fontshop, etc.

    but with some modifications (a, g, \u2026)."
