  been approached by a New York designer to supply my Halvorsen family free for a
  trial period, for the purposes of a pitch. That is, the designer wants to purchase
  but needs to design some roughs first for management approval, and requests access
  to the fonts in order to do so. The designer named another foundry (whom I have
  emailed for verification) which has previously supplied fonts in this way.\r\n\r\nThis
  seems a dangerous practice to me. Even though I have no reason to doubt the honesty
  of the designer, I'm just wondering if anyone else has been approached in this way
  and if so, what other solutions are possible?\r\n\r\nThanks, Wayne  | Australian
  Type Foundry"

  body: I have found this to be relatively common, especially for publication design.
    Check out Font Bureau's <a href=http://fontbureau.com/help/testing>testing license</a>
    for an example. It is based on the licensee's honesty, but, after all, so are
    standard license agreements.

    about buying a single license, but I could see it being worthwhile for someone
    who might be outfitting a few dozen computers."
