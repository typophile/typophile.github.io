body: Where do you purchase old/ antique books about typography. I remember a thread  <BR>about
  a nebiolo book with beautiful faces and the Enfin Javal seems to be as nice too.  <BR>
  <BR>Please tell me which treasures are in your shelves and where do you get them
  from. <BR> <BR>

  body: There are some nice shops in LA &#40;like Veatch and Dawson&#39;s&#41;, <BR>but
    when I can&#39;t find something at UCLA I use bookfinder.com . <BR> <BR>If you
    can get a hook into a good university library &#40;with an InterLibraryLoan facility&#41;,
    <BR>you can save a lot of money. Unless you want the pleasure of physically owning
    the stuff. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: <a href="http://oakknoll.com/" target="_blank"> Oak Knoll</a> has some good
    stuff. That&#39;s where I got my Bruce Rogers&#39; <i>Pi</i>. Here in Chicago,
    O&#39;Hara&#39;s in Hyde Park occasionally has some interesting stuff. <BR> <BR>Frankly,
    I cruise eBay a lot. I recently scored the 1923 ATF Specimen and the 1958 Intertype
    Specimen at auctions. <BR> <BR>Although I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d call any of
    those &#34;treasures&#34; really...

  body: Romesh Naik, <BR> <BR>&amp; Hrant, I still have boxes of type books. I was
    hoping to sort them out in Vancouver but I am not going to get there. Maybe I
    can get one of my eight children to wade through them, make a list. <BR> <BR>Freight
    is the problem for you guys. There is one of those mail services that box and
    ship. <BR> <BR>Some of the books are rare fine press items. Some signed, designed
    and printed by Goudy and given to Mr Best the then president of Lanston. <BR>
