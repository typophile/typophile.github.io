    gotten around to actually releasing it, but you can get in touch for licensing
    info...\r\n\r\nThe condensed companion is Mesquite I think. \r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/mesquite\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDavid"

  body: "It's great when we can get designer participation. Thanks for joining in
    David. I agree with Renko, it looks great, and it has a dynamic flair that ought
    to make it in demand when it's available. It's NOT your typical Western typeface.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Thank you very much for your kind words! I hope to finally publish Manicotti
    in the not-too-distant future, and you guys have encouraged me to get it off of
    my back burner. In the mean time, feel free to get in touch if you're eyeing it
    for a project.
