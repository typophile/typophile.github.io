    like one of Ray Larabie's fonts, but having looked at all of them, no match. It
    sure does look familiar, though."

  body: I searched for unicase, star over the i, and both, and came up short. I hope
    you have more success than I did, Mike. Thanks for looking. BTW, Mike, package
    on the way soon.
