  body: "Hey one more comment --\r\n\r\nOf course I'll buy it but I'm looking to make
    a logo with this font. Any recommendations for a font that mixes well with this
    font? Maybe a Sans Serif? \r\n\r\nThe logo is for a band called Mary and Liv.
    I want to use \"Shelby\" to spell Liv because  the \"L\" in that typface is perfect.
    Any recommendations for \"Mary\" ??\r\n\r\nMany Thanks!\r\n:)"
