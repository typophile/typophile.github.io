    was. But the ugliness of today's maps is nothing new, as Dutch map-fanatic and
    designer Joost Grootens says: \"Maps became ugly with the coming of CMYK printing,
    which muddled the clarity and atmosphere of a map\" (beforehand they were often
    printed using up to 12 spot colors). The vibrancy and crispness of old maps is
    amazing compared to modern renderings.\r\n\r\nI'll have a peek if I can get one
    shipped over!\r\n\r\nNext to that, I'll post this great lithographed map by the
    English art collective Dorothy:\r\n[[http://www.wearedorothy.com/art/song-map-unlimited-edition]]"

  body: "I have always been attracted by fine map making. Fortunately, the art of
    it is not dead at all. In Saxony there is [[http://www.boehmwanderkarten.de/kv/is_msto.html|Dr.-Ing.
    Rolf B\xF6hm]] who draws regional area maps entirely by hand (!) and distributes
    them. These maps outlevel any competing product in terms of precision and information
    density while retaining a breathtaking degree of visual balance. I can only recommend
    to look at his production. "

  body: "Doing a search on how maps are printed, I couldn't find too much, except
    information about wax engraving. That technique allowed maps to be drawn as a
    positive, rather than a negative, image; it was invented by Rand McNally in 1872,
    and was only displaced by photolithography around 1930.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't
    really relate to the quality factors noted here, such as hand placement of lettering
    and the number of colors used in the printing process."

  body: "I haven\u2019t seen the Imus map in the paper, but it doesn\u2019t fare too
    well in the Slate article, vis-a-vis the National Geographic map.\r\nThe type
    looks cluttered, because the designer has been reluctant to vary its alignment
    by \u201Cmapping\u201D it to curved paths, or rotating away from the horizontal.
    Also contributing to the clutter is a lack of variety of type styles, and the
    rather generic sans typeface used, which lacks distinction, in more ways than
    one.\r\n\r\nJust because something is labored over in a traditional manner doesn\u2019t
    make it a good design."

    borrow a term from projectors) of the letterforms (in a sensitive\r\nway, not
    just geometrically) and the point on the MM axis would be\r\nchosen by the illustration
    software based on the curvature of the text\r\npath at that point. The text would
    look perfect. And no human could\r\nreplicate that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I wonder what Edward Tufte thinks of the Imus map. I myself think that, no
    matter the lack of spline paths, the typography is easier to navigate than the
    National Geo map.

  body: "I liked the Imus map.\r\n\r\nI should note that there is one major difference
    between it and the Nat'l Geo map that shows how it just has different goals. The
    Nat'l Geo map has at least twice as many cities marked on it, maybe more. Having
    so many places marked seems to me a likely reason why they couldn't show other
    details that the Imus map does, and need a plain background....\r\n\r\nThat being
    said, there are some things that just seem better done on the Imus map. I like
    his approach to marking state borders for example, even if it is rather non-traditional."
