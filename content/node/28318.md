body: "Here's my experimental attempt at a mega heavy typeface. The influence, of
  course, is from the slab serifs of the wood type era. In the end, I see it at newspaper
  display size, tightly tracked to compensate for its more squarish proportions. \r\n\r\nMy
  main issue right now is the thinning of the S's spine. Not sure how to get away
  from that. Also the C and the G look abnormal. Can someone with an experienced typograph-eye
  give me a crit and/or some helpful advice?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not looking forward
  to shredding my brain for a lowercase set to match. Unless I get some inspiration.
  Can anyone also suggest some nice heavy typefaces for me to look at? \r\nMaybe I
  should just go for small caps. Easier right?"

  body: Thanks. I never thought of a wide/narrow pair in one font. I just might try
    that.
