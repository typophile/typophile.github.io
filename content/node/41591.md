  X) which appears to have Helvetica Neue included as a system font. My full version
  of Helvetica Neue (larger family) is now conflicting when i activate it.\r\n\r\nIt's
  good having it as a system font, but quite infuriating when It's also part of a
  separate, greater family.\r\n\r\nIs there a solution to this? I get 3 conflict messages
  every time I start up! Argh!\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nIf you install your version of Helvetica Neue in the user Fonts
    folder (/Users/<your_username>/Library/Fonts/), it will take precedence over the
    system's version. (Mac OS X's order of font precedence is documented here http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106417).\r\n\r\nOnce
    you do that, InDesign will start using your version. Photoshop and Illustrator
    will also use your version, but if the version you have is Type 1 format, then
    Ps and Ai will also make available the system's version in the font menus. This
    is because the system's version is TrueType and both Ps and Ai are able to distinguish
    the two families, even if the fonts have the same names. The app's font menu will
    display a red 'a' icon in front of the Type 1 version, and an icon with two blue
    'T's in front of the TrueType version.\r\n\r\nNow, I would assume that FontExplorer
    is respecting the OS's precedence order, but I don't use FontExplorer or any font
    manager so I can't say for sure.\r\n\r\nBTW, this font conflict only happens with
    the Type 1 and TrueType versions of Helvetica Neue, since the fonts have the same
    names as the ones installed at the system level. The OpenType version of the Helvetica
    Neue family doesn't have this problem as the fonts have the string 'Std' in their
    names.\r\n"
