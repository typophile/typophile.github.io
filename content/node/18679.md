    impatient to wait for reviews but I wondered if you knew anything about her background
    and why she would be a good author of a type design book.  I Googled her and could
    not find any type designs to her credit.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Washington, and I heard about her and her book from one of her students, Microsoft's
    own Kevin Larson. When Kevin joined the Advanced Reading Technology group he decided
    to go do a type course so he could better understand what people like Mike and
    Geraldine were  talking about. I think this was also part of Kevin's secret plan
    to become an A-list superstar speaker at typography conferences.\r\n \r\nI met
    Karen for the first time on Sunday and got to briefly see the books (English and
    German) for the first time as well. It struck me as a very methodical, practical,
    hands-on manual describing the process of designing a western font. My initial
    reaction was also that it will be a bit controversial, with seasoned pro's exclaiming
    \"you can't distil my fifty years of experience into a how-to guide!\" But I think
    even non-beginers will get something out of it, for example the part on diacritics
    (some Twardochian principles seem to be in use).\r\n\r\nI don't think people will
    feel cheated out of their $20, and I'm going to order copies for my team. I think
    John Berry is writing a review so if people want to wait, they might want to check
    out his thoughts before ordering, but I say go for it!\r\n\r\nAs for why she did
    the book? I'm sure all will be revealed at the talk, but I'll ask her and report
    back.  \r\n\r\nSi"

    are one of the graphic designer's most essential tools; they can determine the
    success or failure of visual communication. In her new book, Designing Type, Karen
    Cheng examines what makes a good typeface, describing in detail how to construct
    letters, numbers, and accents in serif and sans-serif systems. \r\n\r\nCheng analyzes
    a wide range of classic and modern typefaces, including many from today's premier
    contemporary type foundries. In the rapidly broadening market for original and
    custom fonts, Designing Type is an excellent reference for experienced professionals
    and novice designers. \r\n\r\nHosted by Peter Miller Books\r\nCo-sponsored by
    the Simpson Center for the Humanities \r\n\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: ">Review?\r\n\r\nFirst off I had a pint of the Amber, it was okay, but had
    a bit of that fizzy homebrew aftertaste. Then when some others arrived we got
    a pitcher of the Scarlett IPA, described as an \u201Cexperiment\u201D by the barkeep
    it was actually pretty nice, had good color, and didn\u2019t have the kick of
    some other IPA\u2019s. It was pretty smooth. \r\n\r\nAs for the talk, the auditorium
    was full, I\u2019d guess about 180 people, with a number standing. Karen stood
    at the base of the stage and her style was pretty entertaining, a touch of self
    deprecating humor, and jokes which seemed to be a hit with the crowd. Using questions
    reproduced from four or five student evaluation forms, her short (no more than
    half an hour) talk was really an entry-level introduction to the appreciation
    and understanding of type \u2013 and was at the right level for the audience who
    seemed to be mostly students, ex students, friends and local celebrities (Kevin
    Larson & John D. Berry being two I recognized). One question, \u201CWhat\u2019s
    the absolute best font in the world and what is the absolute worst font in the
    world\u201D, was typical of the questions, and provided a way for Karen to show
    bad type used badly, and student work, and spreads from her book. There was plenty
    of time left for audience questions and these again were the typical, legibility
    type questions \u201Cwhy do you use sans fonts on signage\u201D and standard fare
    \u201Chow do designers name their fonts\u201D \u2013 again reinforcing this as
    not a specialist font crowd. Still a worthwhile event. \r\n"

  body: "Hello Sebilar,\r\nThere are very minor differencesbetween the German version
    and the English version. The largest difference is that the German version has
    a different type classification chapter, since their system goes by different
    terminology. Also, the German version uses Quadraat as the body text (rather than
    Univers) \u2014 and it is printed as a casebound book (hardback) with a different
    title.\r\n\r\nI think the \"more than just translated\" bit refers to Henning's
    self-appointed role as an editor, fact-checker and proofreader. Henning made many
    editorial suggestions throughout, especially in the section on accents/diacritics.
    He was particularly helpful (as a native speaker of German, and as an experienced
    type designer) with questions I had about the German eszett.\r\n\r\nKaren"

    through the whole book yet, here's my take:\r\n\r\nThe book is a mostly visual
    compendium of  the options  presented in the design of letterforms. Each page
    could potentially comprise a Typophile thread. For example, how would one design
    a 'Q'? The advantage here is that hours and hours of discussions are distilled
    into a single useful reference. I'm not aware of any other documentation, web
    or print, that is this focused on the shapes of letters. \r\n\r\nMany books on
    typography tend to cover too many topics and end up being fairly shallow. This
    book only makes historical references when it is necessary for classification
    purposes. This is a good thing. The book also avoids much technological discussion.
    The information would useful for someone cutting Monotype matrices or working
    in FontLab.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think I had a taste of the Scarlet IPA out of Sii's
    pitcher. It was quite good. I owe him, or someone he was with, a pint.  "

    on my blog. My first 5-minute appraisal was quite positive, but I think I need
    to spend a little more time than that before I do a full review.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: i got the book and it's kind of interesting. the book reviews the construction
    of [[Serif]] and [[Sans Serif]] letters. If you've been building letters for a
    while, a lot of the relationships should be well known to you, other small details
    it's interesting to see compared from style to style and spelled out specifically.
    This book would be an even better resource if italics and obliques were covered
    as well... maybe there will be a sequel. I'm wondering if the book was edited
    at any point by a type designer or two as some statements come off a little odd.
    Overall, a good resource, especially for beginners.

  body: "I'll take a whack at an off-the-cuff review:\r\n\r\nUseful, but ultimately
    not necessary. The analysis is limited to roman (i.e. upright) letterforms with
    a strong bias toward normative shapes, and text faces (but Hoefler's Didot when
    it appears is one of the display masters). There is little history (which admittedly
    wouldn't fit) but even less context. I wonder if all the attention to measuring
    production details is wasted when what all designers need (both users and makers
    of type) is visual sensitivity. The student work that is scattered throughout
    the book is immature, and doesn't show much in the way of strong design concepts;
    compared to the work from graduates of KABK and the University of Reading. Unlike
    more polemic, or quirkier, treatments of typeforms and how they are made or passed
    down to us (Noordzij, Young, Smeijers, etc.) this book seems to basically encourage
    minor riffs on the typefaces of the twentieth century. For a book seemingly devoted
    to textfaces, there are few examples & discussions of text composition showing
    how the details work in practice. The fact that the US edition is set in Univers
    vs. the more recent Quadraat, says something about its timidity. And I still love
    Univers to this day."

    \u201Cder Buchstabe\u201D is a compound word of \u201CBuch\u201D+\u201CStab\u201D,
    which literally means \u201Cbook bar\u201D, i.e. it stands for a piece of printing
    type. Funnily enough, the original meaning of \u201CBuchstabe\u201D (a piece of
    printing type) has been expanded, so these days it just means \u201Cletter\u201D
    (as part of any writing/script/type). Through reverse translation, printing type
    is now called \u201Cdie Type\u201D, \u201Cdie Drucktype\u201D or... \u201Cdie

    n m r &c look right, or how to deal with X and W diagonals. Nevertheless this
    is a good source for studying how others did it, and to see examples from different
    typefaces next to each other. I find these ones particularly interesting: overlap
    comparisons e.g. for a/n, r/n, V/W, c/r-bowl (though I miss f and s here), or
    the i/j/f/t-structure comparisons. I had wished for even more such examples.\r\nAs
    to the selection of typefaces, I am not sure if it is the best one, but one could
    question every selection.\r\nHowever, I would ask that all books of this kind

    if it would only turn out to be another jewel in the bookshelf :-)\r\n\r\nFor
    the content: Not too much new findings, even to me, who is into the topic for
    only about one or two years (or is it almost three already?).\r\n\r\nAs peter_bain
    already said: I don't know if all the measuring done is necessary. I don't think
    type designers construct their typefaces in that manner, but it is the result
    of a visual process.\r\n\r\nBut for one thing, the book is very useful to me:
    I can check my letters after designing them, being reminded to details I might
    not have considered without the book. It prevents me from embarrassing situations
    like proudly presenting an \"r\" with equal foot serifes ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat I miss
    is something like this:\r\nhttp://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\r\nSome
    kind of \"learn how to write\" and \"learn how to see\".\r\n\r\nWhat I also miss
    is some more detailed information on italics, bold, smallcaps etc. and how they
    are related to the roman. But I guess that's okay, otherwise this book would have
    much more pages...\r\n\r\nAnd of course, one should not expect something like
    this, typedesign is too complex than it could be put on 200-and-something pages.
    There may be (a) sequel(s), as it says in the foreword (namely italics).\r\n\r\nOn
    the student works: I've seen much more interesting drafts done by beginners on
    typophile...\r\n\r\nAltogether, this sounds sceptical, but in fact I'm happy to
    have bought the book. One just must not expect to buy the nonplus ultra how-to-be-a-typedesigner-in-two-weeks-guide.

    both fully aware of all the missing characters and designs. In fact things have
    to and will always come to an end - all things actually. After 230 pages with
    hundreds of illustrations and thousands of captions it is a good idea to simply
    release something to check the market needs first. There is a lot to add of course.
    Obviously we could begin with the principles of designing italic and oblique faces,
    add some info on caps (rapidly filling another 200 pages) and finally leaving
    the unfinished work to our bereaved as we died whilst analysing kerning differences
    between superior numerals and numerators in Georgian text faces (hello hrant ;-).
    While I can imagine that a book on italic and caps has its market, discussing
    the latter is possibly better hosted in an online forum like this one. Get me
    right: I'm NOT saying that these questions are less important. I'm just talking
    about market - the number of copies sold at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s
    quite a lot of people that don\u2019t design type all day. They will find \"Designing
    Type\" extremely useful, for sure. My assumption is, that people are going to
    use the book because it is useful - regardless whether its title is \"Designing
    Type\" or \"800 commented Letter Designs\" or if the shrink wrapper is clear or
    white (that one goes directly to Mr. Bi\u2018lak). Of course all of the experienced
    type designers get a bit bored to read what they already know. My German introduction
    opens \"Real cooks don\u2019t need cookbooks.\" and  ends with \"But even the
