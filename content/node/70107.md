  \ I would love your input on it!\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI have two versions, a black
  and white one for purposes of evaluating form (of the utmost importance), and one
  that puts the logo on a simple background with a slight drop shadow (just for fun).
  \ Please let me know the following:\r\n\r\n     First impressions\r\n\r\n     Readability\r\n\r\n
  \    What comes to mind when looking at it\r\n\r\n     How it reads\r\n\r\n     If
  it is directly infringing on anything (I hope not)\r\n\r\n     Recommendations,
  critiques, ideas\r\n\r\nAnd so here they are:\r\n\r\nForm:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MW-logopond_5641.png]\r\n\r\nJust
  for fun:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MW-logopond-color-small_6653.png]\r\n\r\nAlso
  it should be noted that I will be integrating the word GRIFFIN underneath the logo.
  \ I'm thinking of designing my own font to keep it in keeping with the logo, but
  if you have any suggestions for typesets that would be awesome!  Thanks!"

    I think the use of type under the logo will be very important for the logo. Start
    working on that.\r\n\r\nAnd be careful creating nice shaded, gradient silvery
    versions of the logo before you get the shape as you want it. It's better to work
    in simple black and white, as it will give you the clearest picture.\r\n\r\nDefine
    what the logo is for, is there a target group, what are competitors in the same
    field doing. Is it recognisable? Does it jump out? What associations is it supposed
    to convey? etc. Don't jump the gun in trying to make it look like a final version
    and try out several ideas before settling on one to finalize. Process is everything!\r\n\r\nGood

  body: "Hey thanks so much for your feedback everyone!  Your promptness and depth
    of your feedback astounded me.\r\n\r\n@omashuisje  I want it to read MW so I'm
    glad that was your first perception.  It never even occurred to me that it could
    read MU, so I am now pondering what I can do to make it really read as MW.  I
    feel like it should be clear. I wanted to incorporate the letters, to play off
    of their inverse relationship, along with giving it a singular form that speaks
    as a unified symbol.  I agree that the corners on the outside could be a tad more
    rounded (they are currently the same radius as the inner rounded parts).  I played
    with increasing the width of the inside lines, and I personally like this amount
    the best.  I tried sizing it down, to a business card logo size, and even smaller
    to a favicon size and they both worked out and retained the form.  The original
    version I had made had much narrower counters and not did not have the feeling
    I wanted, but also barely worked in a small form.\r\n\r\n@Queneau  I appreciate
    your critique!  It always helps to receive feedback that gives you ideas on how
    to improve a piece.  I will work on integrating the word GRIFFIN underneath it,
    simply adding it, without any thought to font etc, made the logo really seem to
    have more information.  I have to admit I am most assuredly an individual that
    likes to play around with many different versions of a creation, so at least I
    have that under control.  In reference to jumping the gun, I do that quite a bit.
    \ Even if I know its not done, it's just so tempting to play around with it.  I
    am working on taking a much methodical and linear approach to my work, e.g. get
    the form down, then move onto other stuff, instead of form, color, other stuff,
    form, color etc.  So I really appreciate your feedback!  Do you think that integration
    of the type would make the logo less underwhelming?  Once I have the type underneath
    it in place and the actual form completed I think I will play around with the
    negative space, and use it to help convey what I want my logo to say.  I think
    it will be useful to write down attributes that I want it to convey.\r\n\r\n@bert_vanderveen
    What did it say to you?  After reading your comment I can only come to the conclusion
    that you read it as MU (It's supposed to read as a merged MW).  Is that the case?
    \ If so I'm really going to have to think about some things...  \r\n\r\nSo thank
    you again people!  More comments or critiques are always wanted!  I will have
    another update for you in the coming weeks."

    how of the logo. It might be an okay logo for a construction company but completely
    unfit for a church... if you catch my drift.\r\n\r\nAs for the shape itself: If
    they are supposed to be letters it reads MW to me. It somehow reminds me of the
    Enron and Caterpillar (CAT) logos somehow (I'm not saying that this is necessarily
    a bad thing) I feel like the shape is not great because it's too simple and unrefined.
    There is no tension in the shape because it's all straight lines and these lines
    are all of equal thickness. Tension can be created for instances by optical illusion,
    diagonals, etc. There is no one way to do this. You can also look at letter shapes
    to see how tension is created within a shape.\r\n\r\nThe combination of type and
    logo will make it more complete, but they have to be a good match, these two elements
    have to be good in themselves and have to work well together.\r\n\r\nAnd keep
    showing us your progress, to see how you're getting on."

  body: 'Thanks everyone!  I figured I didn''t want to bias your opinion by telling
    you what it was for, as I wanted to get an idea of what you thought it meant.  Here''s
    some background information:  This is going to be a personal logo, that will represent
    myself and my website.  The site will be a mixture of a portfolio, and a blog.  I
    will be marketing myself as a webdesigner and 3D artist, that will (in three years)
    be an environmental scientist.  I wont really be stressing the environmental scientist
    part, as that is not what I will be trying to sell myself as, although I may want
    to incorporate that in somehow.  In some of my drafts I considered angling the
    logo and doing a 3d extrude, but I decided against it, for two reasons: first
    was that I just didn''t like the feeling as much, it made it feel like I was a
    game designer or something along those lines.  And second is that when it was
    at an angle, it could almost be perceived as two letter E''s (like the Enron logo)
    which I obviously didn''t want to go for.  I wanted it''s shape to be simple,
    but I agree I would like it to be attention grabbing as well.  And the type face
    will most assuredly have to fit the feel of the logo.  Thanks again!'

  body: "Hey thanks everyone for your comments!\r\n\r\n@riccard0, Justin_Ch   I was
    worried about that.  People had no problem identifying the logo as MW when it
    was just MW, but now most people I've asked think it looks like MIG.  I have thought
    about what I should do to address this issue and the only solution I can come
    up with is to separate the letters into their individual entities.  I really like
    the incorporated look, but I think it just cannot work in terms of readability.\r\n\r\n@frode
    frank I think I know what you are talking about.  I had someone point that out
    to me on logopond.  It's the Wiesinger Music logo: <a href=\"http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/40832\">Wiesinger
    Music</a>\r\n\r\n@Christopher Dean Hey thanks Christopher for reminding me.  I
    answered most of those questions in my post just above my most recent one.  To
    reiterate what I said before and directly answer your questions:\r\n\r\n1. I do
    some web development, lots of 3D work, and starting back at ceramic sculpture
    work.\r\n2. Where's 2?\r\n3. Because this will be used on my personal website
    I will not have any clients.  However I do want it to say something about myself.
    \ I do not know why I want it to be this way, but I have a strong feeling that
    I want it to be simple and bold.  I am a fairly complex person, with many talents,
    so it may be that I am striving for some simplicity.\r\n4. Griffin is my last
    name.  The logo is my initials.  I think I should incorporate my full name somewhere,
    but I have no clue where to start on that...  Any tips would be great.\r\n5. It
    is personal.  I am very tech oriented and logical, while still manage to maintain
    creative on my 3D cgi and sculptural fronts.  I am a very 3D oriented person,
    so I sometimes find it hard to work in 2 dimensions and I am in a transitional
    point in my life.  So please forgive me if I do not operate with complete certainty
    on this logo.  I was thinking about designing my personal logo around the theme
    of a griffin (the mythological beast) but I think I've psyched myself out of that
    on the basis that I have so little experience designing in 2D compared to my 3D
    endeavors.  Hope that answers your questions!  What do you think?\r\n\r\nHere's
    an update!  I separated all of the letters so it is actually readable as MWG.
    \ What do you think?  Any suggestions on where I should go from here?\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "WM in a monogram form from the top post -- I saw the exact same logo (<em>ex-act</em>,
    down to the rounded corners) in use here in Vancouver. Cannot quite place it,
    but it had to do with construction, most likely demolition or waste management.
    I will try and snap a photo of it next time I see it.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to
    my point - I saw that logo, I liked it for its geometrical construction and then
    immediately forgot what it was for. Remembered the MW, but it didn't connect to
    the actual branding subject. And that's the problem - the design is nice, but
    it is sterile and it exists in isolation just for the sake of itself. If you are
    to scribble MW with your left hand, that would probably make a more identifiable
    logo.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think that with the addition of G and the separation
    of all letters things got much better, the logo acquired personality, so it is
    definitely a move in a right direction. Now just bring MW to life somehow and
    that will be it :)\r\n"
