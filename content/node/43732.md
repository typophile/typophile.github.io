body: "I'm curious to know if any type designers here have color synesthesia and whether
  it influences or inspires your work.\r\n\r\nI don't know how this would manifest,
  but -- well, that's why I'm asking. This is just a personal query, something I've
  wondered about for years, nothing to do with research.\r\n\r\nI have it but am not
  a type designer. It doesn't influence my print design work, but I do occasionally
  employ it in my abstract art.\r\n\r\nColor synesthesia is perceiving specific colors
  associated with letters and numbers. See description at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme-color_synesthesia\r\n\r\nThanks
  to <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/9599\">Alessandro</a> for references in an
  earlier post.\r\n\r\n--Suzanne\r\n"

  body: "I have it slightly. It's greyscale for me and only has to do with numbers,
    dates, times of year or week. I can't say it has influenced my design work at
    all but I have considered working with it somehow in my fine art. I have sketched
    it out a little.\r\n\r\nChris, as far as I can explain it, when I think of a number,
    or a date, I see it kind of in a greyscale continuum. I can't explain why some
    numbers are lighter and others are darker. I can picture the year in the same
    way, different months have different tones."

  body: "To me, it's as if there's a transparent overlay of color over a letter. I
    see type as black (or whatever the ink color is), but also sense/perceive a color
    to each letter and number. It's helpful in recalling names and phone numbers --
    \"no, it's more green than that; must be a 4, not a 9\" -- and spelling.\r\n\r\nIt
    doesn't matter which typeface it is, though the bolder the glyph, the stronger
    the perceived color. It works in handwriting, too.\r\n\r\nGreyscale continuum,
    Patty -- cool! (BTW, \"grey\" is more grey than \"gray.\")\r\n\r\n--Suzanne"
