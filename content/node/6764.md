body: I have a client whom uses it and he thought he knew the perfect size for importing.
  But now he is worried about a so-called wave effect in the logo I sent to him. The
  wave effect is not visible in the file itself but only when you print out of Quickbooks.  <BR>
  <BR>Does anyone use Quickbooks? If yes, have you successfully added your logo? If
  yes, how?

  body: Back in the dark ages, PC Word suffered the same fate . . . <BR> <BR>You actually
    have to build the image in Illustrator 10 with a white background &#40;the perfect
    size&#41; and export it as a WMF file. Only trial and error will yield the correct
    size . . . <BR> <BR>Sorry  I don&#39;t have a copy of Quickbooks to test this
    theory with. Back in the day I did exports from Photoshop but since AI 10 has
    the WMF export feature, it&#39;s probably going to generate a graphic with a better
    chance of working. <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR>Stuart :D
