    you read Leslie Cabarga's book \" the Logo, Font & Lettering Bible\" as a start.
    \r\nhttp://www.logofontandlettering.com/\r\n\r\nAlso, hang around here and look
    at the Design area.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Our work involves putting many languages in brochures. We work in InDesign
    CS. We have now recieved a Hebrew text which views well, I presume, on the PC.
    When put on the Mac it also views well in TextEdit but when copied into InDesign
    it inverts the letters and it will also not display correctly in a special Hebrew
    font which I have. Please give advice or advise me where I can go for help.

    are in a wrong thread. I'd suggested you post a new thread in the build section."

    written from right to left you need InDesign CS ME (Middle Eastern).\r\n\r\nIf
    you need more info please post in the Build section."

  body: "This site (I belong to) is focusing on learning on how to type design.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typeforge.net/cms/\r\n\r\nWe
    are using a free tool called Fontforge.\r\nRight now, only the instructions on
    how to install Fontforge and the links section is more or less complete. In the
    near future we will have a tutorial on how to aproach type design based on:\r\n<ol><a>http://just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/SketchingType</a></ol>\r\n\r\n<ol><a>http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/uppercase.htm</a></ol>\r\n\r\n<ol><a>http://www.typeworkshop.com/</a></ol>\r\n\r\n<ol><a>http://briem.ismennt.is/</a></ol>\r\n\r\n<strong>Maybe
    you can help us out and contribute with your experience</strong> (using Fontforge
    or other programs like Fontlab). It would be really nice to have someone new to
    Type Design to give their insights on how to approach the Type Design process.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    keep paying attention to our website, it will feature nice articles soon.\r\n<ol>
    How to sketch the first characters</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol> How to draw/edit the uppercase
    set</ol>\r\n\r\nIf all goes well we'll be able to put toghether <strong>Typeforge
    Gothic</strong> a full U&lc Grotesque Sans 1 Axis Multiple Master <strong>based
    on 1898 Berthold's Azkidenz Grotesque and 1905 ATF's Franklin Gothic typefaces</strong>.
    (I can dream can\xB4t I?) ;P\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPedro\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\r\n<a
