  with discretionary ligatures like (st, ct etc..).\r\n\r\nSome similar style typo
  like Today Sans, Precious Sans or Foundry Sterling but with ligatures (something
  like Leitura from DSType has).\r\n\r\nThnx in advance :)"

  body: "Thanks everybody for suggestions.... There are few nice solutions like Graublau
    Sans...\r\nBut stil I feel I can't find perfect match. The thing is that i'm looking
    for font that has more monospaced look ( especially \"wider\" look in italics
    that are important to me ) that can be found in Foudndry Sterling or Precous Sans.
    Also I'm looking that letter \"a\" is more proportional. \r\n\r\nLike these ex
    in Sterling:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f1_5995.jpg] [img:sites/default/files/old-images/f1_a_5162.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr
    Precious:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p1_6692.jpg] [img:sites/default/files/old-images/p1_a_6449.jpg]"
