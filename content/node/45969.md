  and FF Scala Sans Pro), the small caps don't seem to work. SP and SSP don't have
  a \"petite\" cap option.\r\n\r\nBased on the sample below, what do people think
  - am I so used to seeing the full height caps for these acronyms that my eyes are
  lying to me, or am I missing a third way?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nKeith\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/smallcaps_5091.jpg]"

  body: "This topic has been covered before, many times, but the place to start is
    <cite>why</cite> many typographers use small caps for acronyms. The answer usually
    given -- and the one I would give -- is that full caps, like lining figures, call
    attention to themselves because of their physical size. When that attention is
    unwanted, they are awkward.\r\n\r\nBut consider a book about FDR, where \"FDR\"
    is one of few acronyms or abbreviations in the entire text. Here, it would be
    odd to minimize the force of the name -- spelled out, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
    would have initial caps, & so \"stand out.\" In fact this happened in a book I
    designed, and I set FDR in full caps throughout.\r\n\r\nIf the acronyms in the
    copy you are setting are an important part of the sentences -- rather than, say,
    just a passing reference, you may want to set them all full cap.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    should you decide on small caps, you can make them a bit bigger than comes form
    the foundry. InDesign at least, lets you search for character style as an option,
    so you could search & replace (say) 10-point small caps with 10.5, or whatever
    size seems to give the bit more emphasis you feel needed.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "Thanks both.\r\n\r\nCharles: a difficult one, but the sheer density of the
    acronyms is what has me reaching for the smallcap. The paragraph shown above is
    representative of pretty much *every* paragraph in the text.\r\n\r\nI have the
    acronyms styled in InDesign so it's straightforward to use a slightly larger size.
    \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nK"

  body: "I beg to differ, Charles. \r\n\r\n> spelled out, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
    would have initial caps, & so \u201Cstand out.\u201D \r\n\r\nNo it doesn't. If
    it was typed FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, then it would stand out. When the caps
    are separated by lower case letters, then the effect of a blob of caps is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe
    effect is not nearly so nasty with smaller acronyms and initialisms. Most people
    don't small cap US, because it then seems to become the word us, and creating
    confusion to the reader is much worse than having bad color through full caps.\r\n\r\n(All
    that said, I find the small caps in the original posting to be too small. Is there
    a rule that a designer must design his small caps to the x-height? That is fine
    for ITC type faces, but when the x-height is small I would think a better design
    is to be slightly larger than the x-height.) "

  body: "Don, When I look to see what stands out, I read. Moreover, I read at least
    a page, not a single phrase. So here is the test. Set two pages of type (a spread)
    that has the words \"Fanklin Delano Roosevelt about 15 times. See if that doesn't
    catch you eye -- unless you're a Regan Republican.\r\n\r\nA curmudgeon I remain;
    from my perspective, one of the problems with some typographers is they look at
    a small sample of type, in a certain context, and draw a(n almost absolute) conclusion.
    They aren't alone; editors are apt to do the same, though often their conclusions
    vary from the typographer. And of course the same could be said of me. But I remain
    convinced that the best answer to many questions about how to handle a text element
    visually will vary depending on the text itself, along with considering the intended
    audience. That's why design is more than memorizing a set of rules.\r\n\r\n"

    was working on a publication for a government, you seem to have be working on
    one for a multinational corporation.\r\n\r\nIf you can't rewrite the text, you
    ideally want a typeface with a small cap whose height is in between the x-height
    and the full cap. This is because when you begin a sentence with an acronym (and
    it will happen sooner or later), the small cap will be clearly too small otherwise.\r\n\r\nI
    was using Jeremy Tankard's Bliss (has x-height small caps) when I hit this problem,
    and I sent him an email asking for a solution. He was good enough to telephone
    me, but couldn't really offer any suggestion other that rewriting the text. In
    the end, I scaled up a lighter weight of Bliss to get the in-between caps I was
    after. I thought it worked OK, but I'm not sure what Tankard's opinion was."
