  words.\r\ni was intending to go for a wordmark, but the client insists on having
  a depiction of a starfish in there! (which is easily to be mistaken with a star).\r\n\r\nso
  we have a symbol and three words!\r\n\r\nrefresh me with ideas/suggestions or simply
  blame me for being creatively stuck."

    top of my head is that the pionty bits of the starfish are at 3 levels.\r\nIt
    is probably no help whatsoever but at least it might get the ball rolling!\r\n\r\nWil"

    is the hardest bit. But i was merely looking for ideas regarding the combination
    of a symbol and multiple words."

  body: This may or may not help, but don't limit yourself to just a top-down view
    of the starfish. Try different angles. This may prevent it from looking like just
    a star.

  body: thanks, microspective. i am thinking of having one swimming, with the legs
    bent inward, viewed from the side. have only one meagre example though. i googled
    and checked stockphotos, but most show them as a star, unfortunately.

  body: Look at relatives and unusual species of the starfish. I mean, just look at
    the wikipedia page for example of extreme variety.

    just came from a thread about things sucking). '

  body: Is it a rule that all three words have to be equal in size? If you can emphasize
    one or two of them, it might make things work out better.

  body: 'If you have the starfish gently bent around a rock, then it will be obvious
    that it is not a star. Also it if is purple or orange or something if the logo
    is most often in colour. Also, the underside of the starfish is cool looking and
    the pattern of the tentacles or whatever it is under there, could have a letterform
    swirled around in there somehow. '
