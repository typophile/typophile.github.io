  body: "Can be wrong but looks like a custom job. It's either a sans with some serifs
    added or a serif with some serifs removed. If I have to reproduce it and even
    if it sounds lazy, I'd start with Helvetica Neue Bold (/Y, /H and /O look not
    so far), simply add some serifs manually (they look like to be geometric, simple
    triangles) and  make /W central flat vertex pointy.\r\nSame vein but \"all\" serif:
