  in San Francisco on Monday, August 6th, at the Embarcadero Cinemas (same place as
  last time). Your long-suffering filmmaker will be there to intro and Q&A. So if
  you know anyone who got shut out of the screenings last time, tickets and info may
  be <a href=\"http://www.helveticafilm.com/sf.html\">found here</a>. \r\n\r\nCheers
  from Auckland,\r\n\r\n-Gary"
