  body: "This office promotes cultural projects, mainly music concerts, offering support
    to the artists and providing the necessary structure for to event to happen, including
    media planning and graphic design. Target is visual educated: artists, promoters,
    students, liberal workers, 15-35y.o. The name refers to transpiration: \"...we
    will be glad to sweat in order to make your event happen...\" and the typography
    tries to suggest the sweat drop going down (see \"a\" ball) but it drops diagonally
    because of the speed the work is beeing done. Making cultural events oftenly become
    heavy hand made work... and always in a hurry! ...but anyway, the result must
    be art.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The small one is way better than the other one...too swashy with a weak tag-line.

  body: "I agree, there's something about the top one that just...works. (with a little
    tweaking). I don't think anyone will get the 'concept' behind it...but do they
    need to? I initially thought the word was more closely connected with the \"something
    to occur/happen\" definition rather than 'sweating'...but whatever you choose.\r\n\r\nThe
    second one is difficult to read.\r\n\r\nThey're two very different directions.\r\n\r\nI
    question why you've displayed them at such different scales.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nPaul"

  body: "Thanks guys... the point is that this project is a redesign. The first logo
    is the original design and its both typefaces already exisits. The second (big)
    one was drawn based on the concept I mentioned above (and its secondary type is
    Museo).\r\n\r\nSome people read \"v\" insteado of \"t\" on the new type. Could
    you point other problems?\r\n\r\nThanks again..."

  body: The company changed completely. The staff changed and the agreement with the
    last designer did not allow the office to keep using the visual id. The office
    is moving for another building and openning new branches of activities. They used
    not to work that hard on coomunication and design, for example... it is an expanding
    moment and their presence tends to be more solid in the country, as well as the
    logotype.

  body: I like the energy in the redesign -- but it needs a lot of help in the readability
    department. The "T" needs to stand out more. The "p" needs a proper descender,
    which will force you to deal with the tag line, where the loose tracking isn't
    working anyway.

  body: Thanks Dtronic... i guess you got the point. i took this double challenge
    with these unusual "T" and "p". i wonder how clear they are for the kind of experienced
    audience we deal in this situation...

    you could instead tweak the old logo.\r\n"
