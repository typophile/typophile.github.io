  metaphysical treatises by an 18th-century Moroccan Sufi, Ibn Ajiba, was launched
  at this year's ATypI conference. The book has been designed and set by Robert Bringhurst
  with support of Tom Milo, both of whom were speakers at the conference. Robert and
  Tom have shown how to solve the problem of placing Arabic text on facing pages with
  the English translation in a style faithful to the classical Arabic.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=39525&id=1806851628&l=6939add27d\"
