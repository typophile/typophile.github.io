  body: "I'm liking \"Fear\" and \"Compression\". \r\nYou might even exaggerate the
    size in Fear a bit more. (Nice treatment, btw.) \r\n\r\nI like what you've done
    with Compression, but keep playing around with that one. I think you might stumble
    upon something even more clever in there. You're going down the right path. Looking
    good. "

    chance to step away and come back to 'em. \r\nAgreed about compression--too easy
    so far.\r\n\r\nGood thing this homework is fun!\r\n\r\nThank you for your comments.
