  can't get to close without it looking outdate. I kind of need to get into the 19th
  Century time period with it... The 'Cockspur' is the one i'm looking for....\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot guys, appreciate it. "

    Try <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/modesto/>Modesto</a>, and if
    you want something spikier, maybe <a href=http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100022>Saracen</a>
    will fit the bill.\r\n\r\nEDIT: And also, slightly off-topic, but thanks for being
    so descriptive of what you're looking for in your thread's title and first post."
