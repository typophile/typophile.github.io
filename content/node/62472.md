  advice suggests that I should select my font(s) before writing to benefit legibility.
  Similarly, the advice is that I should select my layout before writing. However,
  the geometric picture does not become visible until after I have written!\r\n\r\nIn
  which case, to achieve any given page composition, the relative darkness and grid
  be designed first, then the text written, and then the font(s) selected to achieve
  the pre-determined darkness.\r\n\r\nWouldn't that throw legibility out the window?
  Could you please tell me, do you follow a methodology or work flow that mitigates
  my muddled contradictions?"

    do all the rest of the stuff. If you really want to do something great, add a
    good editor in between. This idea that one person should be able to do everything
    is one of the key reasons why the world is rapidly sinking into illiteracy. (Well,
    I needed _some_ hyperbole in the posting.)"
