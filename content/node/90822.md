  copyright 1998. I've sent an e-mail via the contact form on his <a href=\"http://www.squaregear.net/fonts/college.shtml\">website</a>
  about licensing for commercial use but have not heard back. Can anyone suggest similar
  fonts that I can license for commercial use if I don't hear back from Matthew?\r\n\r\nI'd
  appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!\r\n\r\nKristin"
