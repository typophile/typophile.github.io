  body: "From today's <em>Washington Post</em>...\r\n\r\n<strong>What's behind the
    human touch</strong>\r\nBy Kathleen Parker\r\nWednesday, July 7, 2010\r\n\r\nSometimes
    it takes a scientific study to reveal the obvious. The latest discovery -- that
    touch influences how we perceive things -- is something like the warning on a
    steaming cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nJust as everyone knows that spilling hot liquid
    on one's lap will produce a burning sensation, everyone knows that tactile sensations
    convey information about the object or person being touched. The question is:
    How do we interpret this information? And what actions might we take in response?\r\n\r\nJoshua
    M. Ackerman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sought to answer those
    questions through a series of psychological experiments. He concluded that an
    object's texture, hardness and weight influence our judgments and decisions.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    the obvious: Weight conveys importance (\"weighty issues\") and hardness is associated
    with rigidity. At last we understand the church pew.\r\n\r\nDespite the foregoneness
    of these findings, the implications are significant. How we literally feel things
    can influence everything from our choices when voting to spending money and interacting
    with others.\r\n\r\nIn one experiment, for example, Ackerman gave 54 volunteers
    clipboards with a job applicant's r\xE9sum\xE9 attached. Those holding the heavier
    clipboards rated the candidate more highly, deducing that the applicant was more
    serious.\r\n\r\nIn another experiment, volunteers were asked to complete a puzzle
    with pieces that were either smooth or sandpaper rough, after which they read
    a transcript of a social encounter. Guess who interpreted the interaction as more
    adversarial? This rough interpretation also affected subsequent decision making,
    with the sandpaper group more inclined toward tough negotiation.\r\n\r\nApparently,
    we don't have to touch things only with our hands to get a feel for something.
    Our posteriors are equally receptive to hard-soft messaging. Hence the chair experiment,
    in which subjects were asked to make offers on a car. The dealer would refuse
    the first offer and a second offer immediately followed. Those sitting on hard
    chairs made lower second offers than those sitting on softer chairs.\r\n\r\nWe
    might extrapolate to our hearts' content, but it seems wise that those wishing
    to preserve their virtue in the dating world might avoid the down cushion. And
    why not make those United Nations chairs a little comfier? Might we begin exporting
    Barcaloungers to the Middle East?\r\n\r\nSuch musings led my meandering mind to
    the subject of books and other dead-tree reading products in the digital age.
    I belong to that subgroup of individuals who smell a book before reading. (If
    you are not a book-smeller, we have nothing further to discuss.)\r\n\r\nThe tactile
    experience of reading is also crucial to my reading pleasure. Holding a book compares
    to nothing short of a baby's contact with his favorite blankie. Consistent with
    Ackerman's findings, a hardback is superior to a paperback precisely because it
    is more solid, weightier and, therefore, more permanent, more important, better.\r\n\r\nBut
    might touching words on a printed page vs. reading them online also be relevant
    to one's comprehension and judgment? Are words consigned to tangible and tactually
    rewarding paper more likely to register in our minds than those that float on
    hard tablets subject to the blinkering life span of a battery or extinguishable
    by a bolt of lightning?\r\n\r\nAdmit it: You print out the stories you really
    want to study. Think, too, how differently we consider a handwritten letter vs.
    an e-mail. Even an e-mail printed out seems more important -- more concrete --
    than what we view on the screen. It is, alas, more human.\r\n\r\nPart of the pleasure
    of a real, snail-mail letter isn't only the effort involved in putting words to
    parchment but also the fact of the letter writer having touched the same piece
    of paper. The exchange isn't only an act of communication but one of intimacy.\r\n\r\nWe
    are all part of this immense digital experiment and we know not where it leads.
    But the tactile vacuum inherent in the medium can't be insignificant. Offhand,
    it seems that our technologically enhanced communications, though miraculous in
    speed and access, have become harder and rougher with the medium.\r\n\r\nReaching
    out and touching someone has become easier than ever, but we never really make
    contact. Hunkered over our keyboards, tapping and clicking messages to the vast
    Other, we have become a universe of lone rangers keeping the company of our own
    certitude.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what the world needs now is a kinder, softer desk chair.
    \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm a book smeller, and also flick through books in the book store -- not
    particularly to read. If the paper is rough, I'm noticeably <em>less</em> inclined
    to buy it. A good solid weight, on the other hand, with a firmly bound back and
    not too flimsy cover paper, are points in favor.\r\n\r\nI love the smell of ink
    in new books. Occasionally I can declare a book a laserprint without even looking
    -- I hate the acrid \"electronic\" tang of these.\r\n\r\nWhat does the Kindle
    smell like? The iPad? And now 3D television has arrived, when are we readers going
    to get smell-o-read?"

    against DTP when it started.\r\nI suspect that the e-reading experience will flesh
    out, and other qualities will emerge to make it rich and fulfilling.\r\nNonetheless,
    there's nothing I'd rather do than read an old book set in letterpress, with engraved
    or spot colour illustrations, or gravure photos.\r\n \r\nI recently acquired a
    copy of the Thomas Bewick autobiography. This version reverts to the original
    manuscript in reproducing his abbreviations with superior characters nicely typeset.
    However, I was disappointed they didn't go the whole hog and set authentic long
    \"s\"s! Now that's something an interactive e-book could offer as an option --
    after all \"hist\" is an OpenType feature, I put it in all my new fonts (although
    it is not currently supported by any applications, AFAIK)."

    study based on 24 participants, with a high degree of individual variability.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition it would be nice the know something about the book used; how it was typeset,
    the paper tone, the quality of the print, etc. Those variables are somewhat fixed
    for the Kindle and for the iPad, but they vary widely from book to book, and are
    sure to have an influence upon readability and therefore reading speeds."
