  any sources of inspiration? Labels that make you go \"Wow!\". Books, Web sites?\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for inspiration. I'm desperate.\r\n\r\nThis will be my first time. After
  years of mediocre design for undeserving clients and design agencies, I am now crippled
  with stunted typographic skills.\r\n\r\nPS\u2014I live in Ireland, so I can't visit
  the local <em>Safeway</em> to look at labels on the shelves if you are directing
  me to American brands.\r\n\r\nJC"

  body: Louise's flash intro drives me nuts. Also I think she's starting to rip herself
    off a bit, some of those logos are awfully repetitive. But there's some great
    stuff there.

    what happens when you fall into the world of <em>niche</em>ville. She says she\u2019s
    done over 1000 book jackets too\u2026 hard to do that without repitition or sliding

  body: Interesting she went from books to packaging. I've done both as well and vastly
    prefer books. I'm also a bit bitter because twice I lost design jobs to her because
    of her "name".
