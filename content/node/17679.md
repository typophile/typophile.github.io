  and I would like to explore the possibility of getting a font book of some sort.
  \ I'm thinking more coffee-table like (history of fonts) rather than a book about
  how to use fonts and such.\r\n\r\nAre there any such books?  A book on Futura would
  be especially great.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n-Will"

  body: "I find Burke's book on Renner very good. There's quite a bit on Futura, naturally.
    But I wouldn't call it \"coffe-tableish\".\r\n\r\nFor a very coofee-tableish book
    on typography, maybe you want to take a look at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579120237/qid=1138896146/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-4219255-5238543?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\">Typography</a>,
    by Friedrich Friedl, a big enclyclopedia. The information is sometimes incomplete
    or short, but it has a lot of images..."

    the Dutch type scene. It's a little expensive though...\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9064504601/qid=1138897330/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-7091017-1675832?s=books&v=glance&n=283155"

  body: I second the suggestion of "Dutch Type" by Jan Middendorp. It's really quite
    packed with images, biographical info, specimens, and history. Beautifully designed.
    It is not a typical fluffy coffee-table book, it's much better.

    Colophon - a Book Collector's Quarterly\" from the 1930s.\r\nThe whole set, on
    sale at Oak Knoll for $1500.\r\n\r\nThey were beautifully printed (and hardcover
    bound), and each issue used a variety of classic letterpress fonts, on a variety
    of interesting stocks. fabulous design and illustration. And the articles are
    fascinating, still. \r\n"

    I shall third Jan's [[Dutch Type]], another essential.\r\n\r\nThere is also [[FontBook]],
    the current edition is nearly 8 years old, but if you can wait a couple of months,
    this massive comprehensive guide to digital typefaces is going back to print and
    should be available soon."
