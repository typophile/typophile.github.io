  named \"in use\", where selected examples of BP fonts in use are presented.\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate it if anyone who has used (succesfully, based on his judgment)
  a BP font in his work send me at least one screenshot (jpg, 72dpi, height <= 800px)
  together with a small description of the corresponding work (just send it via email
  at contact@backpacker.gr). The work will be presented in backpacker.gr with a reference
  to the name(s) and url of the designer(s).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help."

    in showing in most of the works. Also, it's intersting to show how they work as
    part of a complete design. That's why I think that this size is adequate.\r\n\r\nGeorge
