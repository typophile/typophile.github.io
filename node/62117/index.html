<li>&ldquo;I’m curious if anyone can say why this is no longer available. I have a copy of it from years ago that I purchased from Scangraphic.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the numerous threads here at Typophile that mentioned some aspects of the Haas Unica copyrights and unavailability, at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/swiss.html">http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/swiss.html</a></p>
<p>One can find the reason why Haas Unica is no longer available and about its copyright’s controversies.</p>
<p>Stephen Coles wrote:</p>
<p>-&ldquo;Scangraphics Digital Type Collection (which included Haas Unica) was purchased by Elsner + Flake in 2003, to which they added font-specific Euro and @ symbols in 2004. The revamped typeface was set to be sold by Scangraphic and its distributors, but Linotype is currently preventing the release, citing trademark violations. Although similarities to other typefaces often occur between foundries, it is rare that one finds typefaces that have been shelved indefinitely due to such resemblances. In truth, the real problem lies within a dispute over who owns the name Haas Unica, rather than any resemblance infringment. Haas Unica is commercially unavailable thanks to Linotype and Scangraphic. Linotype especially stands to lose a lot of Helvetica money if it ever appears.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;As to Nymus’s comment: who is to stop anyone from reconstructing Haas Unica by interpolating Helvetica and Univers and fine tuning the result following the specs posted at Flickr? I can only speak for myself, but what would be the fun in that?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Good point if one already has Haas Unica, but if one doesn’t and wants to buy it and can’t, it becomes an entirely different matter… It becomes something like the search for the Holy Grail…</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Much better to look at what has been done before and try to do something that builds on that work.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe designing a humanist Haas Unica as it was done Stone Humanist or DIN Next or what else do you have in mind?</p>
<p>-&ldquo;I think one of the reasons so many of you are lusting after Unica, is because it is unavailable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are absolutely right!</p>

<p>I did not make this comment because I already have Unica. I made this comment as a type designer who sees no point in slavishly copying the past. In fact I had forgotten I even owned a copy until I read this thread and it sparked my memory.</p>
<p><cite>or what else do you have in mind?</cite> While I think the Helvetica/Unica/Univers is way past its prime, and the thought of a humanist Unica sends shivers down my spine, I have a large grotesque family being released in the next few weeks with the relaunch of the new terminal design website.</p>

</ul>
<p>It was just an example James, and not meant to be taken literally, and yet as history often repeats itself, a maverick type designer (or a serious and well motivated type design team like Andre Gurtlers’) might just try it, starting by interpolating 30% Helvetica, 30% Univers ( or two other Grotesques) and 60% Frutiger Next or any other recently designed Humanist Sans and go on fine tuning it to perfection. All this is theoritical of course&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>“a large grotesque family being released in the next few weeks…”</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if you wish when your grotesque family has been released as I am very interested to see it.</p>
