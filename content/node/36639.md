  body: "There seems to be some resemblances between the initials in this script and
    Poppl Exquisit. The H is quite similar, and one of the A versions is closer to
    Exquisit. However, only certain letters are similar, and the lower case is quite
    different. Unfortunately my books show little in the European scripts, so I have
    no idea whether Friedrich Poppl designed many other script typefaces, besides
    this and Residenz. This is what I would look for, as a starting place.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Hello Mike,\r\nI try to touch the old types only once.\r\nSo I take it out
    of the cabinet, clean, check and classify it and place it into my online-magazine
    to offer it to my customers.\r\n\r\nWith your help, I'll find it.\r\nToday I emptied
    the cabinet. That was important to improve my turnover - otherwise my family will
    be hungry next month.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=69&rubrik=&maxday_in=20070828&article_id=853\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your help.\r\nIts good to know someone anywhere in the world who's crazy
    enough, too, to love these old types. Visit me in Germany if you will travel Europe...\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\nwww.bleisetzer.de\r\n\r\n"
