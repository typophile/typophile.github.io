body: "Hello everyone i am new in logo design andi know this theme is very old but
  i didn\xB4t find any solution.\r\nThe big question is... can a designer use a font
  in a logo and tweaking the letters?(just move some anchor points adding sone round
  borders etc).When i mean tweaking the letters is just for a phrase not for redesign
  all the letters for create a \"new font file\".\r\nI know it depends in some by
  the EULA but i see some design studios like DUOH here is an example http://www.duoh.com/graphics/news/fabulis-logo-start.png
  \r\nfont used is Dessau Pro Regular.\r\nIm pretty new and my english is not so good
  hope everybody understand what i mean :)\r\nthank you very much!!!"

  body: It depends entirely on whether this is permitted by the EULA. Ordinarily you
    can alter the font for any purpose you like, but some licenses restrict using
    the font for logos, requiring an extra fee or forbidding it outright.
