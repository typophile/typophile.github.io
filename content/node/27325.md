  body: "To me this looks like a heavily customized version of some heavy-weight serif
    font, with a strong angled stress (see the O), like an Albertus-based font from
    FontBank called <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/anthony.htm\">Anthony</a>.
    The 'horns' on each letter are add-ons and the longer legs were done just for
    this logo. I wonder if this is not a font, but a customized logo. Are there any
    other words that use this lettering?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
