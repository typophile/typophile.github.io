  presents its first public typeface release\r\n\r\n<strong>Lato</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Lato</strong>
  is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based designer
  <strong>\u0141ukasz Dziedzic</strong> <em>(\u201CLato\u201D means \u201CSummer\u201D
  in Polish).</em> In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the open-source
  Open Font License by his foundry <strong>tyPoland</strong>, with support from Google.\r\n\r\nIn
  the last ten or so years, during which \u0141ukasz has been designing type, most
  of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to solve.
  With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of
  corporate fonts for a large client \u2014 who in the end decided to go in different
  stylistic direction, so the family became available for a public release.\r\n\r\nWhen
  working on Lato, \u0141ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting
  priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite \u201Ctransparent\u201D
  when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger
  sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to
  give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created
  a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010
  \u2014 even though it does not follow any current trend.\r\n\r\nThe semi-rounded
  details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure
  provides stability and seriousness. \u201CMale and female, serious but friendly.
  With the feeling of the Summer,\u201D says \u0141ukasz.\r\n\r\nLato consists of
  <strong>five weights (plus corresponding italics)</strong>, including a beautiful
  hairline style. The first release only includes the <strong>Western character set</strong>.
  Improved screen quality (better hinting), pan-European Latin, Cyrillic and Greek
  extensions, as well as small caps and other typographic niceties are expected in
  <strong>2011</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe entire family is <strong>completely free for any
  desktop and webfont use</strong>, and is available from the Google Font Directory
  at: \r\n<strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/latofonts\">http://bit.ly/latofonts</a></strong>\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll
  appreciate any remarks, comments etc. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nAdam\r\n"

    numbers, small caps? Any notion when they'll be ready?\r\n\r\nAnd secondly, we
    just took in a book that uses (reworked) Charis for text, with Lato for display.
    The designer, Cherie Westmoreland, has gotten at least two books in the AAUP Book
    Show that use Charis for the text. (Of course, she has a fair number of her books
    chosen for the show over the years. Still...) This will be the first time we've
    done a book that used only open source fonts -- and I think Lato more than good
    enough for show books.\r\n\r\nThanks for it,\r\n\r\nCharles"

    we have launched <a href=\"http://www.latofonts.com/\"><strong>latofonts.com \u2014

    on the web or in print, please let us know using the <a href=\"http://www.latofonts.com/gallery/add-to-gallery/\">Add
    to gallery</a> link on the website. \r\n\r\nWe are working a donation scheme that
    will allow us to expand the family and add more characters. I hope that we will
    see more of the family some time in 2012. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    it looks fine (i.e. the hyphens do appear). The very first edition of the Lato
    fonts published about a year ago had the omission of the hyphen glyph. So this
    problem did indeed occur if the oldest version was used. Perhaps, by some chance,
    you've once visited a web page that used Lato some months ago, and that version
    is still in your Safari cache? I don't know. I'd be happy to know, however, if
    the same problem occurs once you've cleaned the Safari cache and then, perhaps,
    restarted the computer? Also, do you have Lato installed locally on your machine
    by any chance? \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
