  body: "PROOF 4\r\n\r\noption 1: \r\nget rid of the tree all together. extend the
    line so it is the width of the 3 b's, or get rid of the line. The b's and your
    text are nice enough to stand on their own, right now they are in competition
    with the tree.\r\n\r\noption 2:\r\n\r\nget rid of the b's, and just focus on the
    tree, make it a lot smaller in proportion to the text (make it roughly the size
    that the b's are.\r\n\r\nPROOF 5:\r\n\r\nDitch the tree all together. \r\n\r\nThe
    tree makes a nice water color painting but not that great of a logo, its gestalt
    is not compact enough. unless you make it a really small element that compliments
    your nice type. but you're type is good enough to be a logotype for sure. just
    stick with that."

  body: Here is an alternate to getting rid of the palm tree [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BEACH_5524.jpg]

  body: I don't care for the style of the palm tree drawing; it doesn't look graceful
    to me, especially the asymmetrical top.

  body: I think Robert's version is a big improvement! (although I still think the
    tree needs some work)

  body: I like the Palm Tree in proof four. It's tilted in a weird way in proof six
    and just looks just strange. I also read 'bridd' (alt. 'bridol') in proof four's
    hand drawn text.

  body: "I think proof 6 is very nice! Just tweak the bridol to bridal and you're
    fine.\r\n\r\nTo me it comes across as elegant and personal. (I could imagine that's
    exactly what you've had envisioned.)"

  body: "The palm tree is a nice idea, as the 3b\u2019s is a potential attractive
    element.\r\nHowever, it\u2019s all about *execution* (like most times).\r\n\r\nI
    guess very few brides would like to look \u2013 on the day of their life \u2013
    as ruffled as the tree in your proofs as-is.\r\nLook closer at a real palm tree.
    It\u2019s a calligraphic challenge.\r\n\r\nFor that reason I don\u2019t think
    Robert\u2019s suggestion is an improvement: type and image are alien to each other.\r\n\r\nTry
    to create the tree and the type out of *one* graphic mood \u2026"

  body: Every body has an opinion and a perspective depending in education, culture
    etc... The Robert solution looks like a logo for  a cheap retirement home in Florida.
    The idea of the watercolor illustration is good an elegant but the palm tree and
    the 3 b is a little tacky. Hire a good professional!

  body: "Robert's variation looks too much like a holiday resort than an elegant store
    that specializes in bridal clothing for the beach (I'm assuming). The reason why
    I believe this is because the palm tree, as beautiful as the colors may be, just
    seems quite overused in everything which your store isn't.\r\n\r\nI will ditto's
    covertjapan's comment on the 3b's being attractive on their own."

  body: I think the type in Proof 6, either unstacked or more neatly arranged, could
    stand on its own.
