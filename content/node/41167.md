  the mid 1800s, Brigham Young, the Mormon (LDS) prophet, saw a need to reform the
  English language with all its marvelous inconsistencies; therefore, he commissioned
  the development of a new alphabet. When it was finished, and even before it was
  finished (because it went through several revisions), they called it the Deseret
  Alphabet. It is a phonetic, non-Roman alphabet, and its development was strongly
  influenced by the work of Isaac Pitman on his phonotypy. The LDS Church used the
  new alphabet to publish scores of newspaper articles, three children's readers,
  the Book of Mormon, and a few other items. Manuscripts were also prepared for the
  Bible, the Doctrine & Covenants (including the Lectures on Faith), the Pearl of
  Great Price, and other books. Unfortunately, none of these were ever put into print.\r\n\r\nFor
  various reasons this experiment in orthographic reform began to lose steam towards
  the end of the prophet's life, and all official church funding for the project ceased
  with the death of Brigham Young in 1877. Interest in the new alphabet faded, and
  today it is nearly lost from all memory.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
