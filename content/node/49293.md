  these are the only two characters I have available. To compound matters, it's from
  a design I put together myself but managed to create outlines in Illustrator without
  noting anything down.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_4213.png]\r\nAny
  ideas? Other than yes, I am stupid?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\ns\r\n"

    a freebie ;-) BTW the image you've posted is the \"old\" Fertigo and is no longer
    available. Below a pic of Fertigo Pro.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tv_4056.png]"
