body: "Hello,\r\nI recently moved into a marketing position for a new winery called
  Firehouse Wine Cellars, but I can't stand the logo they are using. It's  wrong in
  a million different ways (copperplate, unbalanced, palace script - see for yourself).
  \r\nThey want to keep a vintage feeling and use of a maltese cross. I was thinking
  about using something like LHF Old Tom for heading text, but am not sure what to
  pair it with or how to incorporate a maltese cross. Please help! I've hit a block!"

  body: "Hi, I'm a graphic designer. I've seen a number of fire departments use the
    Maltese cross, so it's okay if you want a traditional look. I'm not sure about
    the shape inside. Wine? Fire? Both the symbol and the typography need some work.\r\n\r\nOld
    Tom certainly gives a vintage look and might be an improvement, but coming up
    with a proper logo isn't well suited for top-of-your-head suggestions by people
    who know nothing about the company. Especially when you're not talking to the
    owner, who may have very different ideas.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that changing a
    logo can involve a lot of time and expense \u2014 labels and other packaging,
    signage, stationery, promotional materials, website, etc.\r\n\r\nDon't get me
    wrong, I think it's great you want to make some improvements, but I'm hesitant
    to offer specific suggestions to a well-established company without hearing from
    the owners how they want the company to be viewed, their future plans, and their
    competition. \r\n\r\nI know this isn't the answer you wanted, but my suggestion
    would be to get a good local graphic designer to sit down with you and the owners
    to discuss the logo in depth."

  body: "I agree with James that this is not a process that you want to embark on
    casually. Either you do it \"right\" or you don't do it at all. The landscape
    is full of companies that have attempted to \"update\" their logo or mark and
    have ended up making matters worse, creating as many problems as they solve and
    ending up with just as big a mess as what they started with.\r\n\r\nI don't think
    Old Tom is your answer. It's TOO retro, and it's hot a firehouse type of font,
    it's more of a circus/saloon type font. Copperplate is actually not a bad solution
    but in your logo it is used poorly. It's a difficult font to space properly to
    begin with.\r\n\r\nI think your biggest challenge is going to be integrating the
    cross and the logotype together into one mark. Right now they are two distinct,
    unrelated elements. I'm assuming that the resulting mark needs to be generally
    square given the applications it gets used in, so taking the name and combining
    it with the cross is likely your best approach.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/firehouseWine_3874.png]"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\nThe owner is willing to rebrand. He likes a vintage
    feel, reds and yellows but is very open to new ideas. \r\nWe are a fairly new
    company (just opened in april), so if there were a time to fix this it would be
    now as we are about to release a new crop of wine. We hired a graphic design consultant
    who suggested LHF Old tom and here is the application on a label mock-up\r\n\r\nWe

  body: Old Tom works pretty well there, on that label. Probably worth having the
    designer take a crack at the logo too while you're at it. It's definitely a more
    expressive font than copperplate and looks like the designer has the "gestalt"
    you're looking for.

  body: "\"We would love for it to have a similar feel to our sister company.\"\r\n\r\nFirehouse
    Wine Cellars and Firehouse Brewing? A similar feel might be a good idea, although
    each should be designed with the particular customer base in mind, which might
    be different for the 2 products.\r\n\r\nI like the wine label, but I'd put the
    name with the logo on the back; right now it almost looks like a logo for Riesling.\r\n\r\nThe
    current Firehouse Brewing logo might look good in a large sign, but it won't reduce
    well, which is essential for a modern logo. The illustration and other elements
    become a blur. Maybe with some simplification it could work. Also the bright yellow
    is a color I associate more with McDonalds and other fast food places.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/firehouse_5436.jpg]"
