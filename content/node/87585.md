body: "I am trying to help my wife acquire some basic layout skills. She has training
  in many basic visual design principles but really needs a good primer on western
  typographic layout. She can \"decode\" an English language book, but I was hoping
  there might be a good text in Japanese that is more easily accessible to her. \r\n\r\nIf
  language were not a concern I would probably start  her off with \u201CElements
  of Typographic Style\u201D and \u201CStop Stealing Sheep\u201D. I may end up doing
  that anyways, but if anyone knows anything, please pass it along.\r\n\r\nPS - Typesetting
  and layout is important for this primer and not exclusively letterform design."
