    Leigh,\r\n\r\nThe \"WhatNot\" logotype was custom made, and ummm.. we kinda forgot
    what\r\nwas the base font for that.. hehehe.. but you can ask the designer who\r\nmade
    it.\r\nHer name is Ovelia, the url below is her myspace.\r\nwww.myspace.com/101851224\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, thanks for being that interested in our logotype, Leigh. We'll\r\ntake
