    two vertically stacked dots in the middle (and make the rest abut). In practice
    though what's under the tilde might determine the \"parity\". In fact in some
    of my bitmap fonts the shape of the tilde varies, depending.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "What do the other accents look like?  \r\n\r\nIn space saving contexts (such
    as metro LED signs and indeed in handwriting) Spanish-speakers simply write a
    bar over the letter, macron-style. I'm not sure if there's a language that distinguishes
    between macron and tilde over the same letter (though someone will of course correct
    me if there is).\r\n\r\nIf you are destined to go with the two line shaping, I'd
    just kill the middle dot on the second line, which actually makes it a bit old
    fashioned with the left wave being a bit sharper (and shorter horizontally) than
    the right wave (again, in Spanish contexts, other langauge's MMV).\r\n\r\n<code>-o--o\r\no-oo-</code>\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    aren't used along with N tilde in any languages.\r\n\r\nTherefore a single dot
    would suffice.\r\n\r\nHowever, for, say, Spanish, you might want some parity of
    weight with the acute, so perhaps two dots, side by side.\r\nAny languages with
    dieresis and tilde?"

    of letters can play a pivotal role, especially when they're detached. In the \"i\"
    for example the dot is its saving grace. And maybe the important part of the \xF1
    is the tilde! If so, making it a dot would be a mistake.\r\n\r\n> Any languages

  body: "Spanish and Portuguese both have both, although the dieresis will no longer
    be used in the coming months.\r\n\r\nA tilde by definition can not be a simple
    dot: \"una rayita m\xE1s o menos ondulada encima\" (a more or less wavy small
    line above), and unless seen as Florian has (which still has some width to it)
    will not be interpreted well by a Spaniard, and would certainly confuse Portuguese
    speakers.\r\n\r\nCan you give us a sample of a vowel or of the n itself?  I'm
    trying to imagine an n that is 5 wide and 4 tall but it seems really really wide.
    \ \r\n\r\nThis is what I came up with as being probably a good solution with the
    limited space using five wide  diacritics.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n_diacritics_a_4217.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    I think with majority three wide you might be better.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n_diacritics_b_5259.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    way you can distinguish from the double acute (not that confusion would ever happen,
