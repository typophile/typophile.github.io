  body: "Really? \r\n\r\nI don't really associate this kind of typeface with WW2 prop
    posters. In my mind, as also shown on 2nd pic, more used on fashion editorial.
    Yet on 1st pic, I associated it with Japanese cosmetics products/ads. While on
    3rd, would be Jazz sleeve. Can u show me some of WW2 prop posters using this kind
    of typefaces? Thanks.\r\n\r\nAnd oh, of course anyone could ID this one?"

    differs enough in details and it's not so thin at top & bottom\r\n"
