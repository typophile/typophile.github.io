  I love this but there's just no way they'll go for it unless it's a font. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_6134.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank

    work.\r\n\r\nGoshen is super close, but I need something a little taller, a little
    straighter, a little more uniform. Any ideas? Unrealistic deadlines are looming!"

  body: Enge Holzschrift is really nice, the R is spot on. Does anyone have strong
    feelings for Grot Rough? I'm not sure how I feel about it. It's just not as interesting
    as the original.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type2_3941.jpg]
