  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I want very badly to go to KABK for the Type Media MA program.</p>
<p>Reading the forums here has me so discouraged, however. I feel like there is an insurmountable amount of information about type and type history to digest, I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin to prepare! I once tried to design a typeface for a school project but it wasn&rsquo;t very good (I think I was just trying to rip off Archer in a haphazard way). I love programming (Python!!!), and I love typefaces and want to create them, so KABK seems like a dream.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to do so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning right-handed penmanship (I&rsquo;m a lefty)
Just finished reading The Stroke &amp; LetterLetter
Reading these forums semi-religiously</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, some advice is welcome. Encouragement would be nice :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Type and Media program is open to a wide range of applicants, usually each year has a range of students from those who have released typefaces, to those who have never done and calligraphy or even used FontLab much. I&rsquo;m not saying it is easy to get it, I think they do look for those that show solid typography skills as well as knowledge of type history.</p>
<p>My classmate Ondrej along with a number of other Type and Media students in the past have done calligraphy with their left hand. Calligraphy is only practiced often near the beginning of the course and while quality penmanship is encouraged, I think the primary focus of the calligraphy lessons is to pick up a sensitivity towards spacing (the balance of positive and negative space).</p>
<p>So I do encourage you to apply, it can&rsquo;t hurt &hellip; I am aware of a few people who had to try a few times to get in, there are many applicants for only 11 spots. In the meantime I do encourage you to read as much as you can about type history and delve deeper into areas that interest you.</p>
