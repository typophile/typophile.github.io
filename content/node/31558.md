  doesn't work\u2013they're not remotely close historically, the x-heights differ
  obviously, and Eureka has a slight stress whereas MT Grot has none. But for some
  reason they just seem to work together, and nobody seems to mind. I realize that
  this is partly due to my only using it in situations where the typefaces are not
  use where they'll line up and the differences are noticeable, but there's more to
  it than that. \r\n\r\nIs this just one of those odd exceptions to pairing conventions?
  Or is it common to come up with such couples that contrast well as long as they're
  not up against each other?"

  body: I'd love to hear thoughts on this. I did an untutored pairing of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers-lt/">Univers
    LT</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/minion/">Minion Pro</a>,
    without realizing there were guidelines to pairing. So, although it's too late
    to change anything with that client, I can't wait to hear the insights brought
    on this subject.

    together with AG for example, or avant garde with bembo (altough i really cant
    imagine the latter looking good).\r\n\r\nif the pairing makes sense for the design,
    i think \"conventions\" are unimportant. the eye decides whats right and whats
    wrong.\r\n\r\ni mean i had to use imago with minion once in my internship, and
    it was boring. nothing happened on the pages, it was dead. they fit together pretty
    well of course, but i thought it looked boring. very boring."

    make your decision based on the subject matter and your audience."'
