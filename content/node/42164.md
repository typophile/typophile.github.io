  designer who created the logo and stuff. I want to install the font (carpediem)
  onto my computer. The files came from a mac. Going thru my basic install routine
  seems to not be working. Any knowledge out there on this?\r\nThanks,\r\nsara"

  body: The only font formats that work on both Macs and PCs are OpenType (.otf) or
    Windows TrueType (.ttf). If it's coming from a Mac, and it's not one of those,
    it's not going to work on your PC. You'll need to get hold of a version of the
    font in Windows TrueType (.ttf), OpenType (.otf), or Windows PostScript Type 1
    (.pfb).

    last is CarpeEFReg\r\n\r\nso the deal is these will not open for me?\r\n\r\nI
    only ask in the vain hope that they just need... different extensions typed on
    or such but it isn't sounding good...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nsara"

  body: "No, you need software to convert. The Y&Y TeX program *mactopfa* will do
    it (maybe free from TUG), but without metrical data. There is another that will
    get kerning data from a \"screen font\" (\"scrtoafm\" ?? I forget).\r\n\r\nA lot
    easier with a commercial program like TransType.\r\n\r\nYou also should check
    the license agreement. I believe E&F, at one time anyway, allowed this. Some foundries
    don't. "

  body: BTW, even with a conversion program, the mac files need to be sent to you
    stuffed. As soon as you see the "zero K" for file size, you're lost. This comes
    from the data fork/resource fork Mac system.

  body: "Note that even if the license for the retail font software allows the user
    to convert it, that doesn't mean it allows them to share it with somebody else
    entirely. Usually, this is about as legal (with regards to copyright) as the other
    person sending you a copy of your favorite Office software suite. Might be fine
    if it's OpenOffice, but not so much so with Microsoft Office.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

    with the association... so i don't see any legal conflict. just data conflict

    using that. As someone who has just begun what looks to be a steep learning curve
    on Font Forge I can say that to do what you want to do will take about a day of
    learning to use the software \u2014 ie it is at the easy end of the things that
    can be done with it. There's an online tutorial that can guide you through some
    aspects.\r\n\r\nbest\r\n\r\nEl."

  body: Yeah, the freebees can take so much time to learn & use that if you put any
    value on your time, the true cost is quite high. If you just want to convert a
    font, it's usually cheaper to just re-purchase it. If you want to do custom work,
    then you do need the tools.
