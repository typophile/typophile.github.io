body: I&#39;m looking for a good handwritten font with alternate versions of characters
  for a project that I&#39;m currently working on.  I&#39;ve read through the discussion
  of <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14521.html">favorite handwritten
  fonts</a> from back in August, but I think I&#39;m looking for something a little
  more specific.   <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m looking for is something that possibly has
  the feel of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/enrich/ingrid-font/">Ingrid Font</a>
  but with the functionality and alternates that <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1725.jhtml">Caflisch
  Script Pro</a> has.  But, most specifically, I&#39;d take any handwritten font as
  long as it has some good alternate characters. <BR> <BR>Can anyone help?   Thanks!

  body: Tiffany -- <BR> <BR>Good call, I havent seen Handsome yet.  The only thing
    is that I&#39;d love to use a typeface that has a couple versions of each character
    &#40;or at least the caps&#41; in each weight to keep it looking more natural
    and less repetitive. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the suggestion though

    target="_blank"> LHF Stanford Script</a> has alternates. Looks like <BR>the alts
    are lc only. See the Character Map.
