body: "Can anybody please give me some advice on typefaces to combine with Platform?\r\n\r\nhttp://commercialtype.com/typefaces/platform\r\n\r\nI
  use Platform(bold) for all headers. I need a body copy typeface. Platform regular
  doesn't work on this one since it's a display font and with  large paragraphs it
  not readable enough.\r\n\r\nDon't know yet whether to combine with a sans or sans-serif,
  so tips considering both types are welcome.\r\n\r\nI think it needs a pretty high
  x-height and it should be sligtly condensed, but maybe someone has an other good
  idea.\r\n\r\nAll tips are welcome. Thanks in advance!"

  body: Berton also designed a text face, <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=218">Alda</a>.
    However, your requirements (depending on the length of the body copy) does sound
    more like another typeface from Commercial Type, <a href="http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik">Graphik</a>.
    (Ask them directly if they have a condensed variant in the works!)

    The former will probably make more sense for a longer stretch, with its large
    apertures.'

  body: "Maybe a little off the mark, but <a href=\"http://ernestinefont.com/\">FF
    Ernestine</a> by [[Nina St\xF6ssinger]] is very nice (so is Nina). Also check
    out Erbar\u2019s own slab serif, <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/209/Candida-family.html\">Candida</a>.\r\n\r\nIn
    all of these suggestion, I\u2019ve looked at typefaces that have some stylistic
    details in common with Platform (primarily the Erbar style \u2018a\u2019) and
    that are also (mostly) geometric. If you are looking for a more traditional seriffed
    text face, I would suggest a humanist/Renaissance style typeface. Proportion-wise
    they\u2019re often a better fit than more rational designs. (That said, Platform
    is pretty off when it comes to proportions.) That\u2019s my opinion, anyway."

    just takes some experimenting with size, weight, line length and tracking. You

  body: "(Thanks for the plug Frode!) \r\nI think I\u2019d first try to go the way
    of contrast, not similarity here \u2013 Platform is pretty idiosyncratic, so I\u2019m
    thinking trying to pick something \u201Csimilar\u201D (monoline, sans, circular
    \u201Co\u201Ds etc) might just make it clash. (And I  wouldn\u2019t use either
    Archer or Graphik for extended text.) I\u2019d go the other way, try a serif,
    possibly even with stroke contrast. Something not too narrow, fresh, not too soft.
    Something that works in its own right but clicks into a similar tone. Maybe Eames?
    Or Lyon? Tiempos?"

    you try?\r\nThere a lot of typographic controls in InDesign/XPress that can be
    used to massage a setting into improved readability.\r\nHaving said that, if I
    wanted to mirror Platform in a text setting, I would prefer Avant garde or Century
    Gothic.\r\nMy point is that the categories of Display and Body are not immutable
    solitudes.\r\nHowever, if this situation is for screen rather than print, much
    depends on hinting, which can change the design of a typeface radically."

    see them as -unattainable- pure extremes on an axis, with any font sitting somewhere
    in between. And you can certainly nudge a font in either direction via the setting.
    But you can only nudge it a little bit before stuff breaks, and to me Platform
    is way too close to the Display end.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
