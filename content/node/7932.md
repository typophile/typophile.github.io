    always black and white.

    that I forwarded to the ATypI list on September the second. Her address is in
    that post, assuming you&#39;d like to alert her to this find. But let me know
    on the off chance you haven&#39;t kept every single thing I&#39;ve ever written.  ;-&#41;

    off. ;^&#41; Can you send that link to her?

  body: Thanks all for the postings and the comments. <BR> <BR>Tiffany, I too saw
    the Unseen Hands information back in September and tried to write their curator
    of the exhibition &#40;Rebecca Davidson, I believe&#41; to find out more about
    the exibit itself...but alas no response. <BR> <BR>I am still not sure if the
    San Ripoli nuns were those I was trying to remember &#40;a vague rememberance
    from the &#34;History of Design&#34; book by Phil Meggs&#41;, sure wish Phil Meggs
    was still around... <BR> <BR>...which leads me to another query about his book,
    does anyone know why M.C. Escher was not included nor even mentioned as a graphic
    designer of importance? This question came up in the Century of Design class I
    teach and I couldn&#39;t figure out why either.

  body: Hello, Marjorie. <BR> <BR>Did you try to call Ms. Davidson? I noticed her
    phone number on the page. <BR> <BR>As for the nuns, I&#39;ll look through the
    Meggs book. I have 2 different editions. <BR> <BR>As for Escher, are you asking
    in regards to the Meggs book? Interesting question. Meggs&#39; book, while the
    time line he covers is long, it is very surface and not much depth. But, in defense
    of the book, it was one of my first interactions with typographic history, while
    doing my undergrad work. It does have a decent/good bibliography so I wouldn&#39;t
    call it history-lite.
