  , what sort of antialising/rasterizer are we dealing with when font is used on Adobe
  AIR?

  body: "The rasterization of non-HTML content is handled by the Portable Font Rasterizer
    (PFR) which will give you subpixel rendering. The results are comparable to CoolType
    which is what you get when viewing a PDF in Acrobat/Adobe Reader. The PFR has
    been optimized for mobile and has some rasterization enhancements which CoolType
    currently lacks.\r\nHTML content is rendered via WebKit and will match the platform
    the AIR app is running on, I believe."

    us who survived the web font wars (episode 1). :-)

    just PS fonts in Adobe land?)
