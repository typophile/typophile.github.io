		<div class="commentbody">There it happens again! Another font that I like from a category that I don't. (Is it me, or this forum?&hellip;) Script fonts are usually hopelessly imitative and non-typographic, but this one's cool. <BR> <BR>I'm not sure what bugs you about the &quot;s&quot; (maybe a little too wide) and the &quot;k&quot; (I think it's dandy). The &quot;f&quot; bugs me (the descender shouldn't do that), and the &quot;p&quot; looks like it's running for cover, but otherwise I think you have a winner. <BR> <BR>But what about the caps? Allow me to make a suggestion: don't try to make the conventional Roman cap structures work; instead, look to the uncial tradition. Hammer might have been too much of a purist, be he was onto something - something that remains largely ignored by most. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

You say the k bothers you, but I don't mind it. <BR> <BR>It seems like a few of the elements are a bit forced, like the spur on the q and the tail on the p. Also, the loops on the some of the letters seem a little awkward (too exagerated, perhaps and the ovals not highly refined). <BR> <BR>As an exercise, it would be interesting to see a sample setting of the face, where you could more easily see the relationships between letters outside their order in the alphabet. <BR> <BR>Post it again when you've developed it further. <BR> <BR>Cheers. //Joe</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow,  <BR>cool script font. It would even look good on a shiny new toaster! <BR> <BR>It seems to be a consensus. The 's' is fine, and I'm in love with the 'k'. Please don't change it. The 'p' does look forced, but everything else seems to fit in quite nicely. The tail on the 'q' works for me.  <BR> <BR>I wonder if the 'f' would perk up if the descender wasn't as heavy&hellip; maybe narrowed just a hair. Or try using the 'q's tail without the flip.  <BR> <BR>The whole face seems like a modern caligraphic form. What if all of the letters w/ascenders and descenders varied ever so slightly from top to bottom?  <BR> <BR>Really nice first face&hellip; can't wait to see more stuff.

		<div class="commentbody">Brian! So glad to see you're back. It's looking tasty.  <BR><a href="http://www.virusfonts.com/virus.html" target="_blank">Barnbrook</a> should be pooping his trousers right now. <BR>Let's get your hands dirty&hellip; <BR> <BR><b>1. Balance.</b> I think the upright quality of this design is  <BR>what makes it great. You lost that with the new 'd'. But the  <BR>new 'p' is better - the original being off-balance. The 'g'  <BR>leans a bit too much to the right as well. <BR> <BR><b>2.</b> Good work moving the 't' crossbar to the x-height. <BR> <BR><b>3.</b> I thought Christopher's ideas on the 'y' and 'w' were  <BR>good. Maybe just move the left v stroke of the 'w' to the left  <BR>a tad. He might be right about the 'r' too, but I can't tell <BR>without a text setting. <BR> <BR><b>4. Caps.</b> Your best uppercasers are the simple ones: 'V', <BR>'w', 'A', 'Q'. Don't touch those. I think there's too much going  <BR>on in the 'N', 'T', 'F', 'C'. The Tim Burton curl isn't working  <BR>for me and it belies the smooth, calligraphic nature of the  <BR>face. The ornate 'O' might work as an alternate, but the <BR>simple stressed oval is just fine I have no idea what to do <BR>with the 'E'. <BR> <BR><b>5. Punct.</b> Pretty.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi again, <BR> <BR>Here's the latest version of this font, with a complete set of capitals and some sample text. I'm pretty happy with most of the capitals finally, but I think a few might still need some work, like the 'H', 'K', 'T' and 'Z'.  <BR> <BR>Here are the links: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.oogby.com/lj/letters.swf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.oogby.com/lj/letters.swf">http://www.oogby.com/lj/letters.swf</a></a> <BR><a href="http://www.oogby.com/lj/sample.swf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.oogby.com/lj/sample.swf">http://www.oogby.com/lj/sample.swf</a></a> <BR> <BR>What do you think?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I personally would like the H better if it were a little wider, or if the bar were lower, or both. It just seems to uptight to me, especially next to the with the P and the R.  <BR> <BR>The T I thought looked great in the word &quot;Tulip&quot;, but on the first page I have trouble recognizing it (and only then by process of elimination). Perhaps if the horizontal stroke extended a little further to the right? Or perhaps if the vertical stroke curved in the opposite direction it would be more recognizable by evoking the shape of a lowercase t.</div>

I've moved the horizontal stroke over a bit. Does that help? <BR> <BR>I just noticed that, looking at the B and E, the overshoot on the bottom of the B doesn't feel at all right. I wonder if it's just the B, or if I've got a larger problem here. <BR> <BR></div>
