		<div class="commentbody">Itay, Yanek Yontef (that's the correct name I think) has been the type design teacher of Oded at the at the Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem. Maybe this explains all. I know too little about Yontef to appreciate his work in full.  <BR>His Erica Sans is an *incredibly beautiful* hebrew version of Gill Sans and I'm intentioned to mail him and buy it.  <BR>On the picking of Maya: well I'm surely not enough familiar enough with Hebrew letters to judge it properly. I tend to prefer other faces from Oded, but Maya seems good. Maybe Bringhurst (sorry I called him Gary!) picking Maya has the same problem of many of us latin-based guys. He's not a &quot;prophet&quot;, even if his &quot;Elements&quot; has become a &quot;Bible&quot; for the old as well as the new &quot;Elite&quot;. (this is a personal joke). But Oded submitted Maya only I think, so&hellip;  <BR>BTW: Hey, that Narkis Mem is beautiful! Where do you find Narkis?  <BR>  <BR>On your Asa: Reverse also the question mark: we must challenge conventions if we wish to make more sense: if it's right-to-left, it's right-to-left. I agree with John on the Aleph. The Mem, well, I would like more one of the softer versions, since it becomes too uniform if you &quot;square it&quot; all along. Maybe it's just my taste, but I like variability in forms which are supposed to be similar. This helps the reader, too. <BR>  <BR>John: can you tell me why in occidental packaging (I do pack design, you know), the weight of the product, when expressed in arabic, uses the numerals in reverse order?  <BR>(left-to-right)?  <BR>Also, where I work in the mornings, I've recently typeset a series of cereal boxes in 16 languages and the translator provided us tiff images for Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and Chinese. The energetic values in Arabic are written in Times, instead of using real arabic figures. I wondered why.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>(Narkis is more or less the equivalent of helvetica.)</i> <BR> <BR>A fact that caused me considerable difficulty when I was designing Helvetica Linotype Hebrew last year. It was tricky trying to make my design not look too much like Narkiss Tam, especially if I also wanted to avoid it looking like Arial Hebrew. Not a very satisfactory way to work: a kind of anti-design process in which all decisions are determined by the need to avoid similarities to existing designs. Given the constraints, I'm relatively pleased with the results. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7105.gif" alt="Helvetica Linotype Hebrew "></div>

In fact I feel like I'm always &quot;starting&quot;. I'm 33 by the way. <BR>When I took my diploma in Telecommunications I was sure I would have left that behind. And so it's been. Being in Italy in the late 1980s meant &quot;no education in design available&quot;. The thing has changed slightly, but Italy is a stagnant place for higher education when it cames to graphic design and type. <BR> <BR>My slow work of compromise has been to work part time in contigue fields (learning &quot;on the battlefield&quot;, if we could say so) and cutting out a space for me to learn by myself. <BR> <BR>I don't know if this could work in Israel,  but since you're 17 and since now we have the web I wouldn't worry too  much. When the need arises find a job for a living but keep the necessary space to learn what's really important. <BR> <BR>John: that Helvetica Hebrew LT looks so darn good you could never tell it's an Helvetica, except for tiny details of Helvetica's monotony preserved you've chunked out a warm and beautiful face. A pity us latin-based guys have Helvetica always looming over us. <BR>At least Arial is more friendly. <BR> <BR>Now I'm really curious to see Narkis! <BR> <BR>Hrant or Itay: who is Mr. Zwika?

That's annoying in a type competition, but at least he's honest. I'm not sure why Bringhurst chose Maya - especially since he's such a fan of chirographic (hand-&quot;painted&quot;) type - plus Hebrew doesn't really seem highly &quot;exotic&quot;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the good side is that minority scripts get exposure. But I wonder, was it like the misguided personal pleasure when giving a blanket to a homeless person? Did they perhaps do it to feel better about themselves, to offset (but in no real measure at all) the abuse dished out at &quot;exotics&quot; by western culture? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Speaking as a someone who has judged the TDC event, I think the 'judge's choice' selections do not necessarily represent what the individual judge thinks is the <i>best</i> overall entry in the competition. Rather, they tend to be some work with which the judge feels a particular affinity, or which otherwise strikes the judge personally. The year I judged the competition, I selected Vladimir Yefimov's Kis Cyrillic as my judge's choice. It is a very good design, but probably wouldn't have been my choice if my task had been to select the very best overall design in the competition; indeed, selecting an overall winner would have been very, very difficult. Rather, Vladimir's design struck me as an interesting and important project to which I wanted to draw additional attention and about which I appreciated the opportunity to say something extra in the TDC annual. Interestingly, the same year, Barry Deck and Kathleen Tinkel both used their judge's choice to make critical comments about designs. I don't know what Robert Bringhurst's reasons for selecting Maya were &ndash; and I can't remember what he wrote about the design in that year's annual &ndash; but the selection doesn't necessarily mean that he thought Maya was the best piece in the competition.</div>
