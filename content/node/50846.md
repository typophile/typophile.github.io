  body: "Here is what I can think of right now.\r\n\r\nThe free UK magazine Shortlist
    is pretty much only using Benton Sans from Font Bureau.\r\n\r\nBritish GQ is using
    Sebastian Lesters Soho, Berthold Akzidens Grotesk (and a serif). \r\n\r\nGQ (US)
    is using Titling Gothic from Font Bureau as well as a few others for features
    etc. \r\n\r\nEsquire US is using Mercury (Hoefler and Frere Jones) and Christian
    Schwartz'  Stag and Stag Sans.\r\n\r\nSorry that links aren't included. Busy at
    work. You can search for specific magazine titles here at Typophile and probably
    find a lot more info.\r\n"

  body: "I second Nick's suggestion. If you don't feel confident IDing fonts on the
    spot at the newsstand and don't care to purchase them all to take home, then you
    might try a library with subscriptions to several current periodicals. You can
    always photocopy a representative page and compare with font resources back at
    your studio. And then, for particularly difficult IDs, you can make specific inquiries
    here.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    its hard, and its easier to copy but the result are always worth it."
