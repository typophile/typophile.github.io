  body: It looks like its all custom. I especially don't like the S knocked out of
    the orange circle. The weight of the S doesn't match the S in STRUCSA. The R is
    terrible too (its hurky jerky, not a smooth transition), if you are dealing with
    this company offer to work out the problems with the logo or hire a type designer
    who contributes here.
