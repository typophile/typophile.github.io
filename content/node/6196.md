    is French because you know it was Produced in France? In other words, when I found
    out Choc was done by a Frenchman I could no longer separate that face from France.
    To me, Choc is French.

    true spirit of the original metal type was exist only on the pass by the punchcutters,

    <BR>While I am aware of Garamond originating in France, in comparison to you all,

    France to me...  <BR> <BR>This topic is fascinating... I am aware of typefaces
    countries of origin and I have made some possibly stereotypical connections --
    those Scandanavians and their clean, lovely sans serifs!!!  And maybe, just maybe,
    I thought Europeans were a bit more fond of sans serifs than Americans. <BR> <BR>But
    most of all, I thought there was a pantheon of great typefaces that stood up over
    time and popular the world over, Garamond among them along with Goudy, Helvetica,
    Times...  maybe type is better at conveying a time as opposed to a place...
