body: "i could really use some font suggestions.\r\n\r\ni am in search of a stylish,
  contemporary looking font to be used for small amounts of body copy in a photography
  monograph.  \r\n\r\nthis font should work well when placed next to another section
  that is set in Univers Light.\r\n\r\ni would like the font to be clearly and instantly
  read as separate from the paragraphs set in Univers.\r\n\r\nthis font will possibly
  replace the garamond face used in the PDF sample attached.\r\n\r\nin my mind, i
  am looking for something like a sturdy but not overbearing slab-serif face - but
  i could be totally wrong about that and i'm willing to consider anything at this
  point.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, the client don't have much of a budget, so whatever
  it is, it should be inexpensive or free (or perhaps something that i already own
  that i might have overlooked!)  i know, that is a lame requirement and i am embarrassed
  to have to mention it, but what can you do??? \r\n\r\nthanks for any help!!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks tim!\r\n\r\nideally, i am looking for something a little more contemporary
    looking.  it certainly doesn't have to be a slab-serif font."

  body: "If you want a contemporary slab serif, try Serifa or PMN Caecilia -- the
    latter seems to be popular lately, but I guess I don't have a problem with that
    as I love it. I've been using it and TheSans for my own materials (r\xE9sum\xE9,
    business cards, etc) lately.\r\n\r\nIf you want something that is distinctive
    and will look nice next to Univers, I humbly suggest either Van Dijck or [[Zuzana
    Licko]]'s Filosofia. Van Dijck may be too delicate for what you're trying to do,
    but Filosofia (or another didone) will match the weight and width of Univers well."

    body: "i'm quite fond of PMN Caecilia as well, and it was one of the first fonts
      that i tried!  unfortunately, it feels a little too \"light\" or \"whimsical\"
      (for lack of a better word) in this context.\r\n\r\ni had also previously used
      filosofia, but the client seems to prefer garamond instead.\r\n\r\ni thought
      i had finally found the perfect font in reform from psy/ops, but that doesn't
      seem to fit so well either.\r\n\r\nour deadline is quickly approaching and i
      might just have to settle for the garamond/univers combo."

  body: "Wow, the whole reason I chose PMN Caecilia was because it was like Clarendon,
    only more \"boring\". I like things that are \"boring\". I'm a photographer myself,
    and call what I do taking \"boring pictures of nothing\", which is of course mildly
    disingenous, but I've never found a better name for what I do. In this case, \"boring\"
    means \"businesslike\". I'm surprised it turned out to be too whimsical, but I
    suppose I can see what you mean.\r\n\r\nYou may already be stuck with Garamond,
    but on the off chance you aren't, there's a <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/70242.html?1114510192\">thread
    here about Clarendons</a> (started by yours truly). You may find the faces discussed
    too quirky for your needs, but it's a pretty good rundown on recent slab serifs.
    Or you could try Bitstream Charter, which is conservative but squared off and
    won't clash too badly with Univers. Hmm..."
