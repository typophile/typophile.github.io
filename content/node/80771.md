body: "Looking to id these two typefaces. I'm guessing the headline typeface is either
  Rockwell or Memphis.\r\n\r\nProbably Memphis because Rockwell has a double-story
  'a'\r\n\r\nThe body text - at first glance appears to be Trade Gothic. \r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WilliamsSonoma_01_5627.jpg]"

    The slab looks like something "classic", like [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/stymie/fonts/|Stymie]]/[[http://new.myfonts.com/search/rockwell/fonts/|Rockwell]],
    but some details are totally off...

  body: "It's not memphis, the sample has a double story a. Also the way the lower
    stroke on the e terminates is different.\r\n\r\nIt has a Stymie feel, but that's
    not what it is"
