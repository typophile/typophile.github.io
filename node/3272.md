body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Mark Simonson quickly identified a face for me earlier this morning,
  and I&#39;ve got another one... <BR> <BR>The typeface shown is in use on a wedding
  invitation. My client wants to match it as closely as possible, but I don&#39;t
  think we have to be exact. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, <BR> <BR>Chris Keegan<img

  body: I can tell you right off the bat, that&#39;s not a typeface. It&#39;s a custom
    designed monogram. <BR> <BR>Also, typefaces with cupped serifs like that are unusual.
    In fact, I can&#39;t think of any that are quite like that except for some very
    ornate victorians.

  body: Thanks for another quick response. I was wondering if maybe this was a custom
    designed piece. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your time!

  body: Mark is absolutely right about this being a custom monogram. The interwoven
    characters is the proof it&#39;s not a font. <BR> <BR>If you have graphics software,
    like Illustrator or Freehand, you can do this sort of thing using any suitable
    font. &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/arrus/" target="_blank">Bitstream
    Arrus</a> has a somewhat similar serif style, but would need lengthening/narrowing
    if the letters were to approach this look. There are probably better candidates,
    if you don&#39;t worry about the serifs.&#41; <BR> <BR>For Monogram fonts, you
    might consider the selection of Harold Lohner in his <a href="http://members.aol.com/fontner/monogram-collection.html"
    target="_blank">Monogram Collection</a>, especially the Script versions.

  body: I knew I was going to have to create the monogram &#34;look&#34; myself in
    Illustrator &#40;interlocking characters with the ampersand&#41;, I was more interested
    in the actual font or style of type that was being used. The Victorians reference
    by Mark is helpful, as well as the Arrus link. I&#39;m going to look into some
    types that have a similar feel and go from there. Thanks again for the sage advice...
