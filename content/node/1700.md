  Veer logo. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.veer.com/" target="_blank">http://www.veer.com/</a>
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m told it&#39;s custom... but I&#39;m betting &#34;custom&#34; just
  means &#34;fiddled with&#34;. Anyone have an idea what it is? ... or a suggestion
  for a solid substitute?

    just means &#34;fiddled with&#34;.</i> <BR> <BR>Oh boy, another question right
    up my alley... <BR> <BR>It is definitely custom. Specifically, the cap V &#40;with
    it&#39;s Matt Groening Life In Hell bunny ears&#41; and the r characters were
    basically built from scratch. The two e&#39;s were loosely based on the ones found
    in a script called Hostess. Hostess one of several revivals developed by Tim Ryan
    of SourceNet back in the mid-90s. We were going to market Tim&#39;s collection
    of faces through the Image Club library, but never managed to get a licensing
    agreement in place. <BR> <BR>Sadly, I don&#39;t know what ever happened to Mr
    Ryan or his fonts. I know he did some contract work for Red Rooster at on point
    in time. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s what Hostess SN looks like: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18783.gif"

  body: So. Hm. Damn. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions on a substitute? <BR> <BR>The stage
    show is a modern touring singing all-woman troupe that uses a lot of 1940&#39;s
    styling... I&#39;m thinking of going with Jukebox&#39;s Kon Tiki Lounge typeface
    &#40;<a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=JBT0000031" target="_blank">http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=JBT0000031</a>&#41;,
    but it does have a little more masculine feel to it.

  body: I think you are right, that Kon Tiki Lounge is a little more &#34;all-woman
    drag&#34; as opposed to just &#34;all-woman&#34; ... ;^&#41; <BR> <BR>What about
    Valentina Joy or Luxury Royale? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18791.gif"

  body: You might want to check out Harold Lohner&#39;s four <BR> upright scripts,
    one of which is from the 30&#39;s <BR> and the rest from the 40&#39;s. <BR> <BR>It
    seems like the most feminine would be <a href="http://members.aol.com/fontner/roselyn.html"

    is another upright script from Jukebox, but perhaps a bit too heavy or masculine
    for this situation. If that&#39;s a consideration. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18795.gif"
