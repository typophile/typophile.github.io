    in this related thread: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/50663\">What are the
    most frequently chosen type faces for novels & related books?</a>\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the typefaces you mentioned are not among those \u2018frequently chosen for novels\u2019.
    Still, you can easily find books that are set in Univers etc. You could browse
    your local library, especially the non-fiction sections; catalogues, guides and
    other genres where sans-serifs are more likely to find.\r\nOff the top of my head
    (and shelf): <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Lesetypografie_%28Buch%29\">\u2018Lesetypographie\u2019</a>
    uses Univers; <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/products/books/made_with_fontfont/\">\u2018Made
    with FontFont'</a> is (partly) set in FF Meta Pro; \u2026\r\n\r\nThe catalogues
    of <a href=\"http://www.stiftung-buchkunst.de/\">Stiftung Buchkunst</a> list the
    typefaces used in the books awarded in the annual \u2018Best German Book Design'
    competition.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.steidl.de/static/Steidl_files/sprachauswahl_data/schoenste-buecher-2008.html\">\u2018Beuys.
    Die Revolution sind wir\u2019</a> is set in Univers \u2013 and won a Bronze Medal
    for \u2019Best Book Design from all over the World\u2019 at Leipzig Book Fair
    2009. So did <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/birkhauser/architecture+&+design/book/978-3-7643-8592-7\">\u2018Projekt
    Vitra\u2019</a>, which is set in Futura (albeit a custom version; Vitra-Futura).\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.bookcoverarchive.com/\">Book Cover Archive</a> lets you filter
    books by typeface \u2013 but that data is only referring to the cover design,
    of course, not the actual book. Yet a fabulous ressource, imo.\r\nF"

    local library and browsing through books is that I do not recognize those fonts
    reliably (yet). So I'd like to see more than just a few snippets here and there
    (headlines in web sites etc.), but in a large body of text.\r\n\r\nOr are there
    publishers who routinely add information about the typeface used in the copyright
    information at the beginning of the book? That might be a way..."

    Just in case I'm misunderstanding your sentiment.\r\n\r\nI don't ask for a compendium
    of \"millions of books\". I'd be quite happy with two or three widely available
    examples of books each for pretty some well-known typefaces.\r\n\r\nAnd since
    people are collecting lists like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Power_Rangers_characters,
    I wouldn't say it's unthinkable that someone has compiled just a few examples
    for many typefaces. Maybe even the foundries themselves (\"look, those great books
    were set using our font XYZ\")."

    Depends on the publisher and the genre. For recent German novels, I\u2019d guess
    that almost every second title has this information.\r\n\r\nOne more list:\r\n<a
