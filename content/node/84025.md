body: 'I would like to use lowercase numerals in my dissertation. Dates and numbers
  without units look good but units give me a bit of a headache. Single letter units
  like V or A when typeset as small-caps look good but units with mixed sized letters
  like mV, Pa or kHz look strange. In extreme cases (Cal and cal) it may lead to errors.
  I tried changing the size of "m" in "mV" while using a small-caps "V". You can see
  different size combinations in the attached file. In my opinion 8.5 optical caption
  size "m" (or 9 optical normal with lack of caption size) with 10 small-caps "V"
  yields best results. What do you think of the practice and its results? '

    than the lowercase, or 2: Use regular capitals. If the units are supposed to go
    in text, I''d probably keep the numeral style from the rest of the content. Lowercase
    numerals make more sense in a mixed case setting than with small caps, anyway.'

  body: "Looking at frode frank's suggestion from the other point of view, you could
    use a font where the capital letters (and regular numbers) are smaller than the
    full height. Gentium is a free one. Greta Text is an expensive one.\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text/\r\n\r\nMyself,
    I think the standard numbers and letters would be fine.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do,
    make sure you're not getting too far away from the standard for your business
    or field of study. If in doubt, stay close to the work of other people. Sometimes
    un-fancy is best.\r\n\r\nA remark unrelated to your post... Man, that Arno Pro
    really looks good in your PDF. That's a nice font.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>Sometimes un-fancy is best.</cite>\r\n\r\nI want to second that. I
    had a probably similar case: a scientific treatise with figures happen which to
    appear in many different roles: dates, numbers, tact figures \u2026 a lot more.
    \r\nThere comes the point when you realize that you could find a fancy solution
    for each special case. But altogether, it won\u2019t be convincing to mix half
    a dozen fancies into one typography. What I ended up with: lining figures and
    that\u2019s it. The figures of the font should be decent, of course.\r\nLess is
    more, sometimes. Maybe simple is best."
