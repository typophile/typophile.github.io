  me somewhat of a scene from Blazing Saddles.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps it's because I'm an

  push the fact that they the \"for locals run by locals\" - unlike real banks.\r\n\r\nSi\r\n\r\n"

    \  Aside from the image, Tarsy said, the typeface for the word \u201CWanted\u201D
    is in the style of Judaic caligraphy. A sheriff\u2019s badge that is part of the
    ad and reads \u201CNo Gouging Guarantee\u201D has six points, like the Star of
    David, Tarsy said. </cite>\r\n\r\n\r\nAll right, image aside (goodness knows it's
    pretty bad, and could have been done much better with a little research.), what
    about the \"WANTED\" line resembles Judiac calligraphy? And star shaped badges
    with five, six, and seven points have been popular police bagdes for centuries.\r\n\r\nI
    mean, I can understand the complaint about the photo, especially in the context
    of this ad, but the further complaints just make it look like Tarsy is just looking
    for stuff to complain about."

  body: I have to say, the clear apology from the bank president was unusually forthright.
    Jut because that was the best way to control the damage doesn't mean that he would
    choose it. It also is curious that no single facet would be offensive or unusual
    by itself, but, boy, they certainly stacked together badly.
