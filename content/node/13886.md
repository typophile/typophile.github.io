  dates from the Caslon Letter Foundry promotional material. I am especially interested
  in anything between 1800-1924. If you do I have some questions and may ask for scans.\r\n\r\nI

  body: "Dan,\r\n\r\nI am after a scan from the the Calson 1924 catalogue of the traditional
    Caslon ornaments. My notes say page 32. Also I am after a scan of the two used
    on the end papers. I would like a scan, if you could be so kind, of exact size
    and of an elargement.\r\n\r\nHrant\r\n\r\nI am looking for the date, I think about
    1800 where Caslon was dropped from their own catalogue, also the date, or catalogue
    that shows the first return. Also I would like scans, which in this case sounds
    impossible, of the ornaments. Since that is unlikely I would just for interest
    sake, know if the ornaments were ever discontinued. Probably not.\r\n\r\nThis
    is not a mad rush. I have no specific timetable. In othewords soon would be great.\r\n\r\nGiampa"

    you know I am writing a book on ornaments, Caslon ornaments seems to come up.
    I have questions about these ornaments, refit only one of them. As you know the

    recent? What ever that means.\r\n\r\nBut look, any help would be appreciated.

    saw its last hurrah in the specimen catalog of 1766. Afterwhich there appears
    to be repair and replacement work up until 1805. The Chiswick revival of 1844
    is based on the recovery of punches and matrices in 1839. Howe's inventory does
    not list ornaments as original to Wm Caslon I or II. The only mention of ornaments
    is the cutting of them for the Gresham Press in 1876 (but not necessarily cut
    or cast by the foundry). Anything offered by Stephenson & Blake would not be authentic
    in terms of lineage (to punches and matrices).\r\n\r\nAdobe Caslon is based on
    specimens from \"1738 and 1786\" [sic 1785 ?]. As I recall the Adobe Caslon ornaments
    supplied with the font were from \"later\" issue. They might likely be late 19th
    or even early 20th c. additions. The printer Wesley Tanner was involved in some
    way with the Adobe Caslon ornaments. \r\n\r\nGerald"

    Caslon does have a suite of ornaments it is likely Justin found them somewhere.
    He doesn't mention the ornaments in \"The Compleat Caslon\" the piece he wrote
    on his forthcoming Ligature Caslon [Founder's Caslon] which appeared in Matrix.
