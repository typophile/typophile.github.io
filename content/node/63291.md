  body: "Thanks Jan.  Sorry 'bout the title.  Will do next time.  You are most definitely
    correct about this one.  \r\n\r\nThe font I'd found previously is actually a different
    one that looks very much like this.  It has a variety of weights and italics.
    \ I know there are quite a few fonts out there that are similar to Klavika.  Do
    you know of any other popular ones that are similar?"

    squarish.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: These are all great but not the one I saw.  The "squarish" modern I saw was
    slightly more roundish...I can picture the foundry website...it had a dark background.  I
    absolutely hate finding a font you've been looking for only to lose it again.
