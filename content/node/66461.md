  the often strong influence of silent punchcutters on the end-result fonts. Many
  type designers (such as JvK) have on occasion derided this contribution, but the
  least we should admit is that they've played a role, and in the case of successful/appealing
  fonts presumably a positive one.\r\n\r\nHere's an image of Bremer Antiqua:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BremerAntiqua12_5055.gif]\r\n\r\nAnd
  here's one of Emerson:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Emerson.gif\r\n\r\nBoth
  fonts were cut by Louis Hoell... almost 3 decades apart!\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/66413\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/15269\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    why Hoell was employed as the punchcutter?

  body: "The development of Emerson isn't detailed much in the one place you would
    expect it, Blumenthal's \"Typographic Years\". If memory serves Blumenthal took
    a long trip to Europe during the Great Depression, and ended up at Bauer when
    he wanted his font cut; I think this was due to some mutual acquaintance. Louis
    Hoell was Bauer's resident punchcutter (although he was actually nearing the end
    of his life). In his book Blumenthal speaks admiringly of him, his experience
    and abilities. But there is no talk anywhere about any affinities with Hoell's
    earlier work, such as Bremer Antiqua; I noticed that myself, by chance. Also of
    note is that Spiral (see below) was proofed at the Bremer press during its development.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    a clarification and a correction: the original version cut by Hoell was called
    Spiral, while Emerson was the name of the typeface released by Monotype; the elapsed
    time between Bremer Antiqua and Spiral was closer to 2 decades than 3.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The development of Spiral/Emerson was covered pretty thoroughly by Jerry
    Kelly (who worked with Blumenthal and has first-hand accounts) in his article
    on this typeface in the APHA\u2019s <em>American Proprietary Typefaces</em>.\r\n\r\nIn
    the section entitled \u201CThe Influence of the Bremer Presse,\u201D Kelly writes
    that the Bremer Presse was \u201Cthe strongest influence on Blumenthal\u2019s
    early work.\u201D He\u2019s speaking here specifically about influence on Blumenthal\u2019s
    printing sensibility, but obviously it applies broadly. \r\n\r\nBlumenthal visited
    Wiegand in Munich shortly after starting the Spiral Press and just a few years
    before embarking on his own type design.\r\n\r\nWhen Blumenthal was ready to have
    his type produced, he traveled to Frankfurt specifically to work with Hoell and
    the Bauer foundry, presumably because of their success with Wiegand\u2019s font.\r\n\r\nKelly
    reports, \u201CThe initial drawings formed more of a guide than an exact model
    for the punchcutter Louis Hoell to work from. The punches were cut by Hoell with
    the designer close at hand.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Spiral face went through a couple
    different cuttings, becoming progressively less overtly calligraphic, before arriving
    at its final form.\r\n\r\nYou should get your hands on a copy of <em>[[http://oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=97457&d_currency=|American

    presumably because of their success with Wiegand\u2019s font.\r\n\r\nMakes sense.\r\n\r\nKelly's
    insights are highly revealing. It would have been nice for Blumenthal to say something
    more candid and concrete in his book. The way I see it, Emerson should be credited
    equally to Blumenthal and Hoell; and this is exactly the sort of thing that was
    in my mind when I started this thread concerning punchcutters get short shrift.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    \"American Proprietary Typefaces\" is something I've had my eye on for a long
    while, but in the eternal quest to save money I've been holding off until I could
    make a[nother] trip to the Clark Library... Except the last time I went (for a
    riveting lecture by Russell Maret) the library was closed. Now I'm thinking TypeCon-LA
    should include a side-trip there... when it's open!\r\n\r\nBTW, is Consuegra's
    \"American Type Design and Designers\" any good?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well, you won\u2019t get any argument from me that punchcutters like Hoell,
    Malin, Wiebking, et al. made a contribution to the final results of projects they
    were engaged in. But I don\u2019t know if Hoell deserves *equal* credit in the
    sense that we currently credit type designers. \r\n\r\nI think you would need
    to examine the progress of the design a little more carefully before making that
    claim. Apparently a bunch of material (punches, smoke proofs, etc.) exists now
    in the Cary Collection at RIT.\r\n\r\nIf you read the Kelly article, you\u2019ll
    find that Blumenthal started sketching well in advance of engaging Hoell/Bauer.
    The similarities between the Bremer Presse font and Spiral are probably as much
    a result of Blumenthal\u2019s obvious admiration of Wiegand\u2019s work as they
    are of any innate stylistic contribution of Hoell\u2019s. (Or perhaps I\u2019m
    not giving adequate credit to Hoell\u2019s influence on the Bremer?)\r\n\r\nAnd,
    as I understand the account, the movement progressively away from the calligraphic
    was driven by Blumenthal\u2019s personal ideas and experiences as a printer. \r\n\r\nAgain,
    I\u2019m not saying that Hoell did not probably contribute a great deal in terms
    of making the design a successful <em>font</em>. I just don\u2019t know if the
    contribution rises to the level of equal <em>design</em> credit.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    not familiar with the Conseugra book."

    blackletter/calligraphic influence, reminding me of Romic with the asymmetric
    serifs. And I can see the similarities with Emerson of course. Perhaps it's my
    uneducated eye but the /s/ looks unhappy, and is the spacing bumpy? And what a
    strange choice for the /y/. And is that a question mark next to the exclamation?\r\n\r\nI
    like the way it seems to have options with different widths (e.g. /r/, /s/ and
    /t/). Would the two sizes of asterisk be for upper and lowercase settings?"
