body: "Celebrating Mardi Gras with a poster I did for a music show in college. I cut
  the lettering by hand on a silkscreen stencil, possibly freehand but more likely
  traced from a pencil sketch.\r\nI did a lot of these in college. I had no formal
  training in typography at the time, and was experimenting with letterforms. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MardiGras1970small_4192.jpg]"
