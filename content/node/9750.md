  or callouts, and not necessarily bothered with the typeface selection: <BR> <BR>I
  think one point that needs to be kept in mind is context of what is being read.
  If, for instance, I am reading a steamy romance novel or a physical science book
  I will be deep into the &#34;context&#34; and more than likely will be able to guess
  what will be the rest of the word. Am I wrong? If a word like &#34;microelectronics&#34;
  is in the paragraph I assume that the context will lead up to and follow this word.
  I guess if I were to &#34;choose sides&#34; I&#39;d split it &#34;microelec-tronics&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>Just thoughts really. This is interesting. '

    of how a patient of Freud&#39;s -who desparately wanted to have a child- kept
    reading the word &#34;stock&#34; as &#34;stork&#34;... This type of stuff happens
    to me all the time &#40;even though I have no hope of ever getting pregnant :-&#41;,
    and as soon as they happen I spend the next half hour trying to figure out why!
    For example, I once read the word &#34;Toronto&#34; as &#34;Tomato&#34;, and I
    think it&#39;s because the article was about graphic design &#40;noting that Tomato
    is a famous British design firm&#41;. Another time I read the proper name &#34;Perral&#34;
    as the word &#34;Federal&#34;, &#91;maybe&#93; because it was on a highway sign.

  body: ' And this is the point at which one chooses a more &#42;readable&#42; &#40;enjoyable
    and/or pleasurable&#41; typeface to assist in the &#42;legibility&#42; &#40;discernable
    and/or decipherable&#41; of the written text.  <BR> <BR>But, must the face have
    long ascenders and descenders? I know a few news/text type designers &#40;dead
    and alive&#41; that might argue this point. &#40;&#40;I&#39;m not saying I necessarily
    agree with them.&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>Freudian slips. Perhaps that comes from wanting
    to write the text or at least edit. Are we sometimes too lazy in our reading and
    guess at the words? This is where context can cause problems I suppose, or rather
    putting our own assumptions on the text. '
