  body: I don&#39;t believe that is a font. I think it&#39;s hand-drawn. With no duplicate
    letters I know that&#39;s hard to prove, but it looks like something from an old
    brand name in an advertisement. If that&#39;s a brand that has had that look for
    over 20 years, you can almost bet it was hand-drawn lettering.
