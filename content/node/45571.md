  script font Olicana was so well received I started thinking about a calligraphically
  influenced serif - something with plenty of movement. What are your thoughts of
  it so far? Maybe I'll do an infant 'a' to go with the alternate 'g' for a different
  stylistic variation.\r\n\r\nIs it worth pursuing this? I have no idea if something
  like this exists already - does it? and is this different enough?\r\n\r\nThis is
  the Extra Black style, I've also done some Light glyphs. There will probably be
  6 weights (if the response is fairly positive, otherwise I'll abandon it and come
  back to it when I've finished all my other half-finished projects).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serifg's_4483.jpg]"

  body: "I like it a lot. The serifs seem like an odd mixture at times, but I think
    both styles can plausibly work together. In the \"p'  the mixture seems nice.
    I like the more structured looking 2 story g best. Also I think the single story
    g and 2 story a have a more cartoony look that make them stand out too much. I
    would imagine a solution for the a is not so simple in the bold weight. Overall
    though, I think its a very rich looking font. Great work!\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: "Very nice hand-molded feel. \r\n\r\nFor me, some of the joins are a bit painfully
    thin. This is especially true for the bowl of the a. Compare the join of the top
    of the p and of the r. To me the r is good and the p too thin. \r\n\r\nAlso given
    the rounded tops of the head serifs, it would seem to call for cupped foot serifs.
    \r\n\r\nBut overall the curves are very sweet, and this would be a very warm and
    attractive display face. "

  body: Nick this is really nice. I could absolutely see this in use. To drive yourself
    even more crazy you could think about how optical sizing might change the shapes.  And
    you could always use stylistic sets or alternates to include both a and g alternate
    glyphs.

  body: I think the double story g works best in your example. Although I could imagine
    a single story could work very well too, but your current incarnation might be
    a bit too 'freeform', so to speak. But I think you should definitely do both g's.

    is more what I would expect to see with serifs and modeling of the kind you have.
    That doesn't mean you have to cater though.\r\n\r\nI wonder if a big more weight
    to the ear would be good, maybe a higher arc on top - but that is partly an optical
    size question.\r\n\r\nThis design has the funk. ( a compliment )"

    - and you can see it in 6 weights.\r\n\r\nI'm concentrating on the one 'g' at
    the moment, but will include the other as an extra alternate glyph.\r\n\r\nI've
    thickened the thin strokes, made the ear of the 'g' a bit more beefy and shortened
    the crossbar on the 't' to lessen the space between it and the following character.
    I also shortened the serifs on the 'y' for the same reason, but that isn't shown

  body: "That g needs to be more kinky!\r\n\r\nThe horizontal stroke of the tail in
    the boldest weight has the flavor, but the lights are too regular. In general
    I think the light weights need more faceting in the round letters (o, e, g etc)
    to match the other letters (m,n,h,b,d,p...). I don't think contrast is the issue
    as William suggests. Get kinky with it!"

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\nGreat work, its looking really nice. I especially like the e,
    c and o. They have a really nice feeling cut. I also like the double story g,
    the y, the r and the f - although I find the g to be a little upright. I love
    the hard angled internal serif on the s - but maybe it needs to be accentuated
    further. Not a big fan of the serif on the top of the s.  \r\n\r\nTo me the glyphs
    I've listed above seem to fit into a more harder chiseled face, which seems a
    little bit at odds with the other softer more hand-drawn characteristics. EG,
    the ear on the g, the underside of the e, the hard internal bowl of the o all
    work together, but don't really fit with the more fluid calligraphic style of
    the h, m, n, b, t, i, v. BTW, I love the variation in weights - its nice to see
    the skeleton underneath still holds up at light weights. "

  body: "Thanks everybody. \r\n\r\nI've been refining away for the past few days,
    and now I've done the complete lower case. I decided that the light weight was
    a bit too anorexic to get any decent bumps so I fattened it up. The heaviest weight
    is also a fair bit heavier, and looking pretty damn chunky! \r\n\r\nThis has been
    quite a learning process - there's a very fine line between good-looking curves
    with a few bumps and a bumpy mess. Some characters are more angular than the previous
    examples - c, e g (slightly) and s, and others have been made more substantial
    - a, the ear on the g (BTW - I like the top of the s, so I'll leave it). William
    - try rounding the tops of the foot serifs to match the pattern of the head serifs
    - What? like Cheltenham you mean? I'm not keen on that idea - I like the contrast
    between the top and bottom serifs.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty pleased with it so far -
    it has plenty of character but can be taken seriously, without straying into the
    'cartoony' look.\r\n\r\nAny glaring errors I've missed?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JX6_4753.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "Somehow this double story g seems to stand out a bit. At least to me. I guess
    because it has less angles than some/most of the other characters.\r\nAnd is it
    me, or does it lean to the left a little bit? (especially in the lighter weight
    in the last image).\r\n\r\nApart from that, I think you're right; it does have
    alot of character, without getting cartoony."

  body: I think what's going on is the g is the most typical/normal of the glyphs.
    So it stands out. It doesn't have the same degree of kink in it. The double thinness
    of the a catches my a bit too much in the heavy weights too. The q is similar.
    What if the crossbar of the f was a little higher on the right? This is evolving
    really nicely.

    have more of the funky stress' of the other letters. What Jelmar is saying about
    being less smooth is exactly right I think. It is hard to really know without
