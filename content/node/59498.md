  logo design project for a client. This is my first time, and I could use some info:
  What are the ground-rules for using fonts in wordmarks/logo design in general?\r\n\r\nCan
  I just purchase any font and use it as part of a wordmark? Can I modify a font outline
  and give that to the client? If I use a font, can I legally give my client the vector
  outline as an Illustrator file? What are the do's and don'ts of font licensing in
  corporate identity projects?\r\n\r\nYou have my undying gratitude for any help you
  can offer. (Tips and pointers also welcome!)"

  body: It varies by the foundry and sometimes the particular font. Most font EULAs
    specifically allow a small number of glyph outlines to be used in logotypes, while
    some either disallow this or require a special extra license fee. Read your font's
    license carefully, and when in doubt, ask the foundry.
