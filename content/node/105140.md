  body: "Don't have my refs at hand so this is from memory. Q looks similar to one
    of the Didots. So would be worthwhile checking them for matches. Not a lot of
    digital versions of condensed Didots. Perhaps in an old specimen book?\r\nDon"

  body: Looking at the Encyclopedia of Typefaces by Jaspert, Berry and Johnson it
    is  close to french Round Face by Monotype and Serie No. 16 by Deberny & Peignot,
    but these are later I think, and less condensed.
