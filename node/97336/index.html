  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm creating a logo for an interior design/architecture company, attached image is one of my proposals, but the client keep telling that he need more elegant typeface. I've tried san serif fonts like gill sans and skola sans.
What does he mean by elegant? is it like bodoni/didot, or some scripts or what?

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_5327.png]
here is my client comment for this design:-
" Can try to add color yellow in the name HAITHAM JAFFER OR in TAG LINE
tag line font size to be revised
try to change name HAITHAM JAFFER font to be more elegant"

Any suggestion for the font(preferably free)? especially something that suits interior design/architecture company

		<div class="commentbody">Like apankrat said.  You need to figure out what the client means; maybe show them some different font samples and ask which one(s) have the feel they're looking for.  

Of course as the designer your recommendation may be something totally different than they have in mind, but understanding what they have in mind may help clarify how they view their company and the company's future direction.</div>

Words like "elegant" can mean different things to different people. 

Same thing with color names. Google a descriptive color name (such as "teal") and you'll see considerable variations. If a client tells me they want a certain color, I pull out a swatch book and make sure we're both thinking of the same thing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's not as bad as that. Sure, ask the client for examples, but if you try too hard to nail down his terminology he's going to think you're dumb and/or insecure.

BTW I need to add to my list: thin.

Not if it's handled properly. In fact most clients are pleased that you want to understand them clearly.  

And it's better to spend 30 seconds pinning down what they mean instead than spending hours on a layout they won't like because you misunderstood them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I guess it depends on how much the client wants the designer to follow directions versus doing some creative interpretation. I think the most fruitful client-designer relationships are founded on a sort of trust where making things too explicit neuters the positive potential.

		<div class="commentbody">...and asking them for every single thing makes you look as if you're just creating what they told you. So they don't actually need you to charge them more than any school kid would to just put pieces together.

A nice questionaire at the beginning with letter forms, shapes, colours is a nice test to ask them what they relate each of these shapes to? And then from their brief of the company get the actual liking what will fit their mind. While also giving you enough space of creativity.</div>
