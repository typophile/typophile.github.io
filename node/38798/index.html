  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I just found this forum and am hoping to find some help here.  In my typography class our assignment is to do two variations of a poster with type only.  Anything goes on it for the most part except for the use of imagery.  However; we have to have a two page paper along with it over the typeface we choose, and it has to be single spaced.  i want to do a modern, sans serifed type of some sort.  But, i cannot find enough information over any of the ones i choose and I'm running our of choices. 

Please suggest a sans serifed, modern font that has enough information on it. maybe i am just searching wrong, but i cannot find a source with enough info, so please tell me where i can get the amount of info i need. thanks a lot in advance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What guidelines have you been given regarding the content of your paper?  I can imagine such a paper possibly including:

* a discussion of the development of the typeface
* comments from the typeface's designer
* reactions from people other than the designer, both praise and criticism
* a discussion of uses to which the font has historically been put; are there usage trends associated with the font (was it extremely popular in, say, the 1970s? has it been growing in popularity since its introduction? etc.)?  Are there particularly famous (or infamous) applications of the font?
* an analysis of the font's characteristics
* personal reflections on the font: why you chose it (though if you really chose it because there is a lot of "information on it," you should come up with some other explanation); how it supports or detracts from the idea your poster is trying to convey; etc.

What does your instructor want you to get out of this assignment?  What do you want to get out of the assignment?

If what you really want is a sans serif font with a substantial literature, I'd try Optima, Helvetica, or Futura (disclaimer: with the exception of Zapf's book <em>About Alphabets</em>, I don't know what info is out there regarding any of these fonts.  If, however, you ever need to write a paper on indigenous language dictionaries, let me know and I'll send you a decent bibliography).  But maybe a more satisfying approach to this assignment would be to choose a font (or a handful of fonts) that would work well for your poster and ask for help finding resources related to that font/those fonts.

Either way, good luck with your project.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for that information, aric. as far as guidelines, really there are none.  To provide just a little background, this is a new professor and he really doesn't have his act together.  all of our assignments have been fairly vague, mostly useless, and he has not really sat down to teach us as a class; and we have yet to have a critique on any of our projects.  

basically, our assignment is just to do 2 posters- one B/W and one color.  all the poster really needs to say is the name of the font and show what most of the characters would look like (at least the alphabet). but, it can be laid out in any way we choose; something that would compliment the font.  i think i won't have any problem with this using a sans serifed font.

i do really like Helvetica, in fact it's one of my favs, but someone has already chosen it, and was able to find easily a lot of information. i think i will look into optima. i will check the school library for Zapf's book About Alphabets. 

what do you mean by indigenous language dictionaries? i'm not sure if that's something i need to write about or not. 

as far as choosing a font that would work well for my poster, and then worrying about the resources, i'm not too worried about that. i have several ideas that i can work with as long as it is a sans serifed font. something bolder or thicker would be best.  everything i have tried so far has not had enough information on it. i'm sure it does somewhere as i know alot of these typefaces were modern before computers were around and are based off of pre-existing fonts.  i say all that to say, whatever font i can get, i think i will be able to work with it to design something nice and would still be able to state a personal reason on choosing that font rather then just the reason that there was enough info.

thanks for the help so far!

::edit:: and by the way, if neither of those two suggested fonts do work out(and this is for anyone else with suggestions), we are able to use any font from any designer or type foundry. although, i really would have thought that the type foundries would have more background on their fonts. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bryce Thorne, that was just ironic sort of Morissette's "like rain on your wedding day." Morissette also said that information cannot be designed; what can be designed are the modes of transfer and the representations of information. This is inherent in the nature of information, and it is important for designers to keep the concepts of information and meaning distinct.
I've done a similar <a href="http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/~asegalini/0607/t2-project3.gif">project</a> with my students, see if it helps.

		<div class="commentbody">i see what you're saying. those posters are for the most part the same sort of project we are doing, however instead of the definitions and history of the font being included on the poster, they must be included in a paper. those give me some ideas for mine and some are similar to ideas i already had so thank you. i do like Optima; if i can find enough material over it i will use it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>what do you mean by indigenous language dictionaries? i’m not sure if that’s something i need to write about or not.</em>

Probably not, unless you change your major, or have a penchant for, say, Navajo.

<em>something bolder or thicker would be best</em>

In that case you might also look at Gill Sans.

<em>i do like Optima; if i can find enough material over it i will use it.</em>

Optima is a very popular font.  If you look around your environment, I'm sure you'll see examples of it all over. I've recently noticed it on a Listerine bottle, a calendar, and a book cover.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima|Wikipedia's article on Optima]] has a list of print and web resources that may help you get started.  (It probably goes without saying that Wikipedia has similar lists for many other typefaces.)  As with all research, whenever you read an academic article/book/etc., be sure to read the bibliography and look up any of their sources that may pertain to your topic.</div>
