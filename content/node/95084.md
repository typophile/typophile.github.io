  some pretty cool code from this very fabulous build forum. When there is no glyph
  for a particular fraction the glyphs used in the substitution are encoded in the
  Private Use area.\r\n\r\nNow, however, we\u2019re wondering if they would be better
  in the superscript and subscript range (2070-209F). The main use of the font thus
  far is typesetting in InDesign. The client wants to use this same font for their
  web product though we\u2019re not sure what that will be just yet. So, our thought
  is that if all the numerator and denominator glyphs are encoded in the superscript
  and subscript range we\u2019ll have a little more of a direct \u201Cconversion\u201D
  from the InDesign file using the fraction feature to the superscript and subscript
  Unicode range that should (I think?) be pretty easy to display on the web.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re
  hesitant, however, as very few fonts seem to use the superscript and subscript range
  in any significant way.\r\n\r\nCan anyone comment on what the intent of this range
  is and/or why the numerous fonts we checked out all use private use range or unencoded
  glyphs for the numerator and denominator glyphs?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for slogging
  through this far too long post."

    know which fonts you checked, but I generally use differently sized and positioned
    glyphs for superiors/inferiors and numerator/denominator, with unencoded \u201C.numr\u201D
    and \u201C.dnom\u201D glyphs, e.g:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Frsax_5898.png]"
