  black text font (not as important but it would help) pictured below. These are off
  of an old Jamaican-pressed reggae 45, so the quality is pretty poor but if anyone
  can help I'd appreciate it. I have to recreate these for a reissue in case anyone
  is wondering. Thanks!\r\n\r\nhttp://painkillerrecords.com/cm/militant1.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://painkillerrecords.com/cm/militant2.jpg"
