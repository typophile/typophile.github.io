  used for the alcohol percentage and volume on the wine labels uploaded in this post
  I would be awfully grateful. I particularly love the one used on the Krug label,
  as it has the lightest footprint. Any suggestions for compressed romans with a more
  charigraphic nature rather than transitional/modern which would be suitable for
  the purpose would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nRobert"
