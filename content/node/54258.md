body: "i love these images from the psychadelic era. When I first opened the image
  on the orange and pink image I didn\u2019t even notice the text....I opened it because
  I love the use of color. The orange and pink both warm colors against an almost
  midnight blue makes the image both hot and cold.   The color choice with this piece
  is important becaus e there are only three colors in the whole image. The text is
  awesome too. The fact that it\u2019s in the sunglasses makes it interesting, the
  text forms shapes that resemble a reflection in the lenses.\r\n\r\nThe James Brown
  piece is incredible. The type forming his face and outline of his hair is brilliant
  and definetly a reflection of the type scene during the psycadelic movement adn
  the type forming the rays behind his face gives the image motion...you can almost
  hear his voice...I also thought it was impotant to the design the in some of the
  text they changed the shade of blue nad incorporated different colors. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/2234061783_73644ae316_o_4850.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/jamesbrownposter_4158.jpg]"
