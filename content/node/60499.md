body: I am wondering if anyone has a specimen of Barry Deck's Canicopulis. I have
  heard that it is an homage to Eric Gill, and I would much like to see a sample.
  Anybody?

    It's featured in a design book that I can't remember the name of, but featured
    a lot of CalArts work from that time. I have it at home and can scan it in, if
    needed. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it would appear as if someone has put it up on
    this site [link removed] but I can't imagine that it's legally there.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    so I thought the site was just showing character samples. I wouldn''t have linked
    it otherwise. '

  body: 'No worries, Corey. When I remove a link I''m just doing my job. I realize
    that anyone with google can find it for themselves. It is just a matter of people
    not being able to find it through Typophile. '
