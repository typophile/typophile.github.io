  body: "<a href=\"http://www.typedesign.com/fonts/mojo.html\">Jim Parkinson says</a>:
    <cite>Mojo is an adaptation of a lettering style that was popularized by 1960s
    artists Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin. This style is rooted in the Art Noueau
    period and was most strongly influenced by the lettering of turn-of-the-century
    Viennese poster designer Alfred Roller.</cite>\r\n\r\nBoth <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/2509/mojo.html\">Linotype</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?RU\">Identifont</a> state the year
    1960. If that\u2019s correct, [[Jim Parkinson]] did the typeface when he was only
    19."

    were designed in. I did check myfonts.com, but they don't list the year of origin.
    I'll make sure to check Identifont in the future as well.\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: Well, what I wanted to say is that this information should be taken with a
    grain of salt. How can JP adapt a style in 1960, that remains to be popularized
    by 1960s artists?

  body: "I kinda got that from the fact that he would've had been 19 when he designed
    it ;-) Nevertheless, I know now that I can find this kind of information on Identifont
    if I can't find it anywhere else.\r\nI was just wondering about it 'cause I'm
    currently working on a font that's somewhere inbetween Babyteeth & Mojo & I thought
    it would be cool to name it after the year that is the average of the 'birthyears'
    of Babyteeth (1968) & Mojo (1960?). Either that or I'll name it after my own birthyear
    ;-)\r\nThanks anyway for your help!"
