  Dune books by Frank Herbert published during the 1970's and 1980's (Berkley Book
  editions before they merged with Penguin)? \r\n\r\nThe typographer may have been
  Jeremiah B. Lighter, but not 100% certain. I having trouble posting a pic of the
  cover, but hoping maybe somebody may know off-hand.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"

    were all hand lettered as far as I can tell. Don't know of a font that would match,
    though ITC Benguiat Condensed has a similar feel and was used on some of the later
    books."
