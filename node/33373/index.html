		<div class="commentbody">From USPTO.gov:

What is a trademark or service mark?

    * A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words, phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others.
    * A service mark is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product. Throughout this booklet, the terms "trademark" and "mark" refer to both trademarks and service marks.

Do Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents protect the same things?

No. Trademarks, copyrights and patents all differ. A copyright protects an original artistic or literary work; a patent protects an invention. For copyright information, go to http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/. For patent information, go to http://www.uspto.gov/main/patents.htm.

Is registration of my mark required?
No. You can establish rights in a mark based on legitimate use of the mark. However, owning a federal trademark registration on the Principal Register provides several advantages, e.g.,

    * constructive notice to the public of the registrant's claim of ownership of the mark;
    * a legal presumption of the registrant's ownership of the mark and the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the registration;
    * the ability to bring an action concerning the mark in federal court;
    * the use of the U.S registration as a basis to obtain registration in foreign countries; and
    * the ability to file the U.S. registration with the U.S. Customs Service to prevent importation of infringing foreign goods.

When can I use the trademark symbols TM, SM and ®?

Any time you claim rights in a mark, you may use the "TM" (trademark) or "SM" (service mark) designation to alert the public to your claim, regardless of whether you have filed an application with the USPTO. However, you may use the federal registration symbol "®" only after the USPTO actually registers a mark, and not while an application is pending. Also, you may use the registration symbol with the mark only on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the federal trademark registration. </div>

If the typeface name in question exists as some kind of dafont.com rip-off, you're probably safe to use it for your "real" typeface.

In all things, the golden rule is the best one to follow: Do unto others as you would like others to do unto you. So. Would you like someone else to come along and use your typeface names for their typefaces?

My 2 cents.</div>

I had been planning to name a typeface "Austin", after the 19th century type designer.
I have discovered by chance (typecentric surfing serendipity) that Christian Schwartz has already named a face Austin, but he has not released it, or, AFAIK, publicized it other than on a single web page, and you won't find it by Googling. Also, Berthold has the name Austin registered, although they have not released anything by that name.

So I thought, maybe I can call it Shinn Austin, in the manner of Adobe Garamond, Stempel Garamond, ITC Garamond etc.

However, to avoid hassle, I'll probably steer clear of Austin. </div>

<a href="http://www.christianschwartz.com/austin.shtml">http://www.christianschwartz.com/austin.shtml</a>

Paul is an immensely talented and prodigious type designer, but the bulk of his work has been created bespoke for British clients, including many magazines. Paul has recently been working with the equally-talented and -prodigious Christian Schwartz, including type systems for <strong>The Guardian</strong> (England), <strong>Público</strong> (Portugal), and another set of British historical type, "Brunel", which was commissioned by Condé-Nast's just-launched <strong>Portfolio</strong> magazine. This collaborative work has been more widely covered in both the mainstream and design press, for good reason.</div>

Garamond is a good example of a name that's in the public domain. It's also a name that has a fairly well understood meaning with respect to font appearance and style. So naming your font "Garamond Toby" would be fine, but "Helvetica Toby" or "Interstate Toby" would not. </div>

Search it at the USPTO on TESS (for United States pending, registered and dead federal trademarks)

http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&state=rj48fh.1.1

For example, "Helvetica" turns up four distinct registrations, including a pending one for financial services.


Google isn't especially good for this kind of search</div>
