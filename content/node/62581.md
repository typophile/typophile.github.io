body: "This topic came to mind when I saw a fellow design student propose setting
  a magazine masthead in Bell Centennial.  I couldn't help but think of some HF&J
  material set in Retina, a typeface designed for a similar purpose, at very large
  points sizes as an obvious joke. The difference of course was that this Bell Centennial
  masthead was no joke...\r\n\r\nSo the question: <strong>What's the most inappropriate
  case of type selection you've ever seen?</strong>\r\n(Let's exclude IKEA's use of
  Verdana. There's a long enough thread dedicated to it.)"

  body: "I think we've found a use for Comic Sans \u2013 gravestones! It strips it
    of its most heinous crimes and has the ability to make a message on a gravestone
    seem heartfelt and personal. Sure, other fonts could do this much better, but
    this is the best use of Comic Sans I have ever seen (in fact the only good one).
    In may ways this has blown the whole graveyard type industry apart. I'm looking
    forward to a time when grieving grandchildren can stamp their handprint into the
    still-wet concrete, and then run crying to their mum for a hug (thus ruining their
    well-chosen expensive mourning outfit.)"
