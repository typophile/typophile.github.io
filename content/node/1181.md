  target="_blank">http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/unicode_mixing.html</a>
  <BR> <BR>The author &#40;who is Australian&#41; is primarily interested in Unicode
  and the Greek language, but this page covers the interesting topic of script mixing.
  Sub-topics of note: <BR> <BR>- Kurds in the ex-USSR use Cyrillic script with the
  additional latin &#34;q&#34;. However, the capital Q is usually drawn like a big
  lowercase q. Does it deserve its own unicode slot? &#40;I say yes!&#41; <BR> <BR>-
  Wakhi, a central Asian language, has a mixed script of Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek
  letters. <BR> <BR>- The Byzantine Greeks used to use a lot of Latin-script words
  in their documents, but with Greek affixes and diacritics. Eventually, the &#34;Greek-style&#34;
  of writing certain words caught on among Latin scribes! <BR> <BR>- Certain Greek
  dialects use a Latin letters to represent sounds not present in standard Greek.
  <BR> <BR>Cases like these could really push Unicode and type design to their respective
  limits. <BR> <BR><i>However</i>, the real reason I&#39;m posting is that this is
  the first website I&#39;ve seen with all content available in English, Greek, Latin,
  Esperanto, Lojban, and Klingon!!! [Yes, that fact deserves a Triple-bang.] I wonder
  what his target readership is. <BR> <BR>Paul'

    of google translations you can look at, including Bork, Esperanto, Klingon, and
    Elmer Fudd.

    closer to the limit of the ridiculous: <BR> <BR><a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n1643/n1643.htm"

    we.  <BR> <BR>I think people have too much spare time on their hands. The end

    <BR>and what if the two communities accidentally came into contact? Would it be
    love at first sight, an exchange of prisoners or phasers set to stun? <BR> <BR>Matha.

  body: The Unicode Klingon proposal was rejected, mainly because the supposed user
    community -- all those people studying the language -- use a Latin transliteration
    instead of the script. Wimps. <BR> <BR>The Tolkien scripts probably will be encoded
    though &#40;in one of the supplementary planes&#41;, not least because Tengwar
    is a serious challenge and solving the problems will be a useful exercise.

    stuff as well. <BR> <BR>Especially considering Klingon is used by more people
    than Tolkien scripts, transliteration or not. <BR> <BR>What klingon really needs
    is a system that can be written easily with a pen, not huge shapes.  What are
    you supposed to outline them and then fill them in?

  body: <i>Okay, see, if they&#39;re going to reject Klingon, they should reject Tolkien

    community approached Unicode with a request, whereas Tolkien enthusiasts have
    &#40;in fact, one of of them is Irish national representative to ISO 10646&#41;.
    In fact, when Unicode approach Klingon -- ahem -- &#39;scholars&#39;, they were
    told that there was no interest in having the script encoded. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    Tengwar is actually very interesting as a complex writing system &#40;it&#39;s
    like an Indic script on drugs&#41;. Klingon is not at all interesting.

  body: Chris, I&#39;m talking about the scripts, not the languages. The Klingon script
    is not very interesting, in the same way that the Latin script is not very interesting,
    i.e. structurally. It&#39;s just a bunch of independent signs in a row. Structurally
    interesting scripts are things like Devanagari and the other Brahmi-derived scripts
    of India and Southeast Asia, and Arabic, and old Byzantine Greek cursive in which
    signs interract contextually, change form, move around, etc. Tengwar is of interest
    to script encoding engineers because it poses challenges and pushes the boundaries
    of technology. Developing an encoding for Klingon, on the other hand, would take
    about five minutes and wouldn&#39;t pose any challenge at all.
