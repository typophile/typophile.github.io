  body: As I don't know any font with /V point "so far below baseline", I'd probably
    start with one among [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/engravers+gothic/|Engravers
    Gothic]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/blair/|Blair]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/sackers+gothic/|Sackers
    Gothic]] (and may be more <strong>Blair</strong> for this one) and customize /V.
