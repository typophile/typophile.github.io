body: "I'm sorry if this has been covered before. I'm working on spacing/kerning and
  my approach seems to be setting a string of words containing the letter I'm spacing...so
  for /x/ I have something like: \r\n\r\n<code>oxygen xanthone sixty excellent inextricably
  axolotl luxury excel exactly calyxes spex pixies mixing xylitol extravaganza</code>\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone come up with a suitable string of (real) words containing eth please? I know
  there are other lists that have kerning letters in initial, medial and final places
  but I'd really like a longish string to see it with as many other letter combinations
  as realistic. Hope that makes sense ;)\r\n"

    and just taking words from there. shouldn't take you too long.
