  (hopefully in indesign, illustrator, fireworks or photoshop!)\r\n\r\nIt's like a
  drop shadow, but different. \r\nThe shadow from the letters on the left side land
  down and to the right, the shadow from the letters on the right land down and the
  left, and the shadows in the middle go straight down.\r\nIt's like a Star Wars effect.\r\n\r\nI
  attached a sample of something very similar to what I want to do. \r\n\r\nI appreciate
  any help!\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n "

    effect.\r\nOf course you can accomplish the same in photoshop\r\nbut it will take
    you a good amount of time, as you have\r\nto draw all the shadows by hand. There
    is also some \r\nreflection on the text which would make it even harder\r\nto
    do it by hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be easier to use Cinema 4D or something similar."

    want the \"shadow\" to be black.\r\n\r\nThis poster is pretty much exactly what
    I want to do in terms of the shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Night-of-the-Living-Dead-3D_6371.jpg]"
