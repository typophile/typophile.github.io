  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello:

I'm trying to help my client get her logo printed for a glass door. I've attached the logo here, and as you can see there are some very fine lines.

She wants the logo on the door, fairly small (about 5 inches wide), as it appears (no background, just the logo on the glass).

I've approached one sign printer, who told me there's no way to print this unless it's on a solid background due to the fine lines. The only other option would be to significantly increase the thickness of the lines, is what I was told.

My instinct tells me this is true, but I just wanted to see if maybe someone knows of another solution. Maybe in the end, it has to be hand painted, or hand etched on the glass?

Thanks in advance for your help!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You could do this with cut vinyl. Find a company that does large format printing. They usually also work with vinyl. They can cut the letters and mount it direct to glass. The think linke and thin typeface might be a bit of a challenge.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The fine lines certainly would be a problem in both screen print and cut vinyl.

I would have thought digital print would be OK, onto clear self adhesive vinyl, mirrored (particularly if you can find someone with a thermal printer).

The problem with cut vinyl is that however good the adhesive, there just isn't enough of it to stop lines that thin being moved around on the glass, assuming that you can plot and weed them sucessfuly in the first place.

With screen print (whether or not the lines are reversed out of a solid colour) you have the probability of rather unsightly "saw-edging" where the image in the stencil collides with the pattern of the mesh. You can't run the image parallel with the mesh because the mesh filaments close up the aperture in the stencil.

Good luck
