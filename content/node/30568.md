  for a while now.\r\nI got the woodtype from my father, who in turn bought it some
  15 odd years ago from a printer that was closing it's shop.\r\nThe woodtype is not
  complete; so I had to design some of the characters from scratch. I first set and
  printed the type, and then scanned and traced the characters by hand in Illustrator
  and Fontlab.\r\n\r\nI would like to have some critique and suggestions. Although,
  since I have tried to stay mostly true to the woodtype, I don't want to change a
  great deal of the character shapes themselves.\r\n\r\nThe following characters were
  available in wood;\r\n- The whole lowercase alphabet,\r\n- The uppercase alphabet,
  except D and Q (made those),\r\n- The question mark (although I did change it a
  bit),\r\n- The numerals, except for 2 and 4, which were available in a less narrow,
  smaller pointsize version of the woodtype I also have. Working on digitization of
  that one as well. I changed those numerals to match size, narrowness and weight.\r\n\r\nI
  designed and added the rest, like the diacritics, interpunction, monetary signs,
  ligatures, the @, plus/minus, etc.\r\nThese characters are open to suggestion. I'm
  still working on the ampersand.\r\nThere are still some b\xE9zier-curve inconsistencies
  here and there, I'm going to smoothen everything out later. Kerning is also on it's
  way, I have about 550 pairs already.\r\n\r\nI own more woodtype, which I also plan
  to digitize, if they do not already exist.\r\nPlease keep in mind this is the first
  step into digital typeface design I've made.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: This is nice. I don't follow the wood type trend, but this did remind me of
    <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/sans/GarageGothic">Garage Gothic</a>
    from Font Bureau. Your font, obviously, has much more character in so far as the
    style goes. Some of the figures seem to have less character than the alphabet
    itself does. I'm looking at the lc_f wondering if more of that couldn't be put
    into the figures. Fewer points, rounder corners.

  body: "Tiffany:\r\nThanks. Especially the rounder corners sounds as good advice,
    I see what you mean. I will try that out when I have some time to work on it again.\r\n\r\nSteven
    Wulf:\r\nYes, <a href=\"http://p-chez.endoria.net/woodtype/woodtypescan.jpg\">here
    is a picture</a>. It's a scan of the lowercase only. I've placed together the
    figures with photoshop, since the print itself is too large to scan in one piece,
    obviously. I don't have the uppercase composed in one file at the moment."

  body: "Hello \r\n\r\nI like it, its comming relly well\r\n\r\nI just have one critique,
    the \"a\" doesn't seem to fit with the other letters, the curve is radically diferent
    from the rest. And the horizontal part of the \"a\" seems to overpass the curve.
    You could try making the \"a\" more like an upsidedown \"e\"\r\n\r\nPS: sorry
    for my bad english\r\ni dont know if i expressed well hehe (I speak spanish)\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nFerch"

    complete specimen of Origo</a> on his website and it looks stunning, both the
    typeface and the graphic design of the specimen. Good job!"

  body: "Fernando: your English is good enough. It's not my native tongue either.\r\nAnyway,
    to reply to your comment; I agree, the 'a' is quite different, although that curve
    is also in the 'g' and in a couple of other characters. I thought about changing
    it when I was digitizing it, but I decided I wanted to stay true to the woodtype
    I had printed. But maybe I might give it a try, and add it as an alternate.\r\n\r\nAntonio:
    Thanks for the compliment. Photos of the printed version of that specimen (which
    is 29x29 cm by the way) are on my site as well. But since I have a flash-site,
    I can't specify a direct link (which is why I sort of hate flash sites, eventhough
    I made it myself). But it's in the 'Print' section, on the top. I say this because
    in the PDF you can't see the embossed and spot-varnished parts of the physical
    specimen. Which were the most fun to make, with photopolymer plates and such.
    :)"
