  Penney brought this to the attention of the ATypI list. Laurence mentioned Mr. McLean's
  book as being one of his first books from which he learned about typography. I'll
  add to that as it was also one of mine.\r\n\r\nHis archives have been available
  to researchers at Reading University \r\nsince 1993:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.library.rdg.ac.uk/colls/special/mclean.html\r\n\r\n"

    his translation of Jost Hochuli's <em>Detail in typography</em> from the original
    German, which Agfa-Compugraphic published around 1986-87.\r\n\r\nI knew him as
    a kind and gentle man who loved type."

    are nicely done.

  body: "Ruari McLean was layout artist and typographer for the boy's comic \"Eagle\",
    which I subscribed to as a young lad of 7 or 8 (late 1950s). As well as strips,
    the Eagle had typeset stories etc.\r\n\r\nRuari McLean to Marcus Morris (founding
    editor, 1950): 'I was on the payroll at \xA35 a week, as your typographic adviser.
    During the day I was working in Holden's advertising agency for George Rainbird
    and I could only see you in the evenings. Shortly you asked me to find a flat
    that we could share during the week; my wife and family were in Essex, yours at
    Birkdale, so this sounded sensible. I found a flat in South Audley Street. You
    were unperturbed when we discovered that most of the other occupants of the building
    were tarts. It was the main activity in South Audley Street; doors banged and
    cars drove away at periodic intervals all through the night until breakfast time.
    Many evenings I was present in the flat when you briefed the artists who had been
    invited to work on this new project. Nearly always they had not done what you
    had asked them to do, but what they thought was really wanted. If, as quite frequently
    happened, they refused to be told how to draw their strips by a young parson who
    had never edited anything except a parish magazine before, and persisted in doing
    it how they wanted, they found themselves dropped.\r\n\r\n'Often we were still
    at it at two or three or even four in the morning, at which time I was ready to
    agree with anything; but you never let anything go until you were completely satisfied,
    and would consult me about a comma or a hyphen, and argue about it endlessly,
    and curse me for being lazy if I said it didn't matter, and could I please go
    to bed? In retrospect, it seems to me that every word and every syllable in the
    early numbers of Eagle were chewed over endlessly, until you were certain it was
    right.'\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I was lucky to find a copy of his <em>Thames and Hudson Manual of Typography</em>
    when I got my first freelance book project a few years ago -- I learned quite
    a bit from this manual! \r\n\r\nMcLean not only wrote about Tschichold, he also
    translated at least two of his books into English -- <em>Aymmetric Typography</em>
    and <em>The New Typography</em> (this last has a great introduction by Robin Kinross,
    I might add)."

  body: Right, Asymmetric Typography was first published in English in Canada by McLelland
    & Stewart in 1969, and my wife had a copy when she was at art school in Winnipeg
    in 1970, which I was lucky enough to read shortly after. A big influence.
