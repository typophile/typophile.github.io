    Company, 1992 http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Holly+Script&q=Go and URW http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/holly-script/
    and by Nick Curtis as Quigley Wiggly, a free font. Comparing the details of the
    P in your image with these fonts \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CompareP_6092.jpg]
    you can see that Quigley Wiggly was used to make it. Unfortunately, this was not
    one of Nick's best, and in this case you get what you pay for, Holly Script fits
    together better and is more carefully finished.\r\nDon"
