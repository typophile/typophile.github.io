body: 'I have recently added quite a lot of small booklets &#40;pdf-format&#41; at
  the Omnibus site, showing how my typefaces look in &#34;print&#34;. I have used
  fairy tales in different languages for the ones available &#40;in English, Esperanto
  and Swedish&#41;, and more will be added: in German, Italian &#40;Boccaccio&#39;s
  Decameron, one short story per booklet&#41;, French and Spanish, but it will take
  some time. <BR> <BR>Besides showing different typefaces, they can be good reading.
  The booklets can be downloaded at  <A HREF="http://www.omnibus.se" TARGET="_top">www.omnibus.se</A>.'
