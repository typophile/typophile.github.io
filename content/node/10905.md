body: Mjellow, <BR> <BR>Remember me with the logo-issues?? <BR> <BR>Well I&#39;m still
  on the search for a nice and functional logo for my company YESYES. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  taken another course since last time and now I&#39;ve altered the characters more
  &#40;based on interstate - 2 versions included&#41; <BR> <BR>What do you think of
  it so far? <BR> <BR>Can anyone suggest a harmonizing symbol to add the logotype
  and perhaps a color-palette? <BR> <BR>Thanks again, <BR>/Henriko <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8455.jpg"

  body: 'Henrik, I&#39;ll post what first came to my mind when I saw this version
    of your logo. And it goes a little something like this: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8465.gif"

    of it myself, but if I settle I&#39;ll let you know. <BR> <BR>How does your old
    mark look next to your new type? <BR> <BR>mitchell'

  body: I think I would like the compressed version better if it didn&#39;t look compressed.
    Meaning that you&#39;ll need to correct the variance in the stroke weight that
    has been introduced by the compression of the letters. <BR> <BR>mitchell

  body: Yep, you&#39;re right there are some difficulties in the &#34;e&#34; and the
    rounding parts of &#34;s&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Still if you haven&#39;t seen the previous
    non-compressed version would you notice it then ?? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying hard
    to skip the nitpickin&#39; part here simply because I&#39;m not an expert in controlling
    vectors in Illustrator &#40;I took me a while to finish the last version&#41;

    <BR> <BR>But the corrections are not inevitable... sigh! <BR> <BR>/Henriko
