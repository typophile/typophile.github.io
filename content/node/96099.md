  > First, the font project. Things are going a little slower than I anticipated because
  the \"algorithmic\" variants aren't always so reliable. At the moment, I have 475
  fonts complete and, realistically, am still a week or two away from finishing.\r\n>
  No problem, take your time.\r\n>\r\n> > Second, Steven Litton of iCreate Magazine
  contacted me yesterday, inquiring about the possibility of including a few of my
  fonts in an upcoming issue. It seems to me that this might be a perfect opportunity
  to get a little free promotion for the fontpack, if we work together on the submission.
  Let me know what you think.\r\n> I think this can be an interesting idea. We can
  prepare a smaller package that can be offered to iCreate readers free of charge,
  in exchange they mention availability of the paid package. Do you know how many
  fonts they want?\r\n>\r\n> > Third, it's annual royalty payment time. 'Nuff said.\r\n>
  We shipped 9,933 copies of software with your fonts, I will arrange $3,476 payment
  as soon as you confirm your PayPal address.\r\n>\r\n> Regards,\r\n> Andrew\r\n>\r\n\r\n============================================\r\n\r\n<strong>9,933
  \xD7 $3.50 = $34,765.50, not $3,476. You owe me some serious money.</strong>\r\n\r\nNick"

    on the people who need to come clean. I remember many years ago a client owed
    me $6,000 and would not reply to my emails, and I knew they knew people on the
    ATypI list, so... The client immediately got in touch, threatened to sue me for
    breach of NDA, but we settled (for a lot more than the $0 I had gotten from them
    up to that point).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
