body: "Dear Typophile Pros,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if any of you guys would like to
  share any approaches you have to making alternative weights to your fonts. Where
  do you start, do you use any scripts or other applications to help you on your way.
  What is your basic methodology.\r\n\r\nDon't mis-understand me, I am not after a
  quick and easy solution. After having made 3 fonts, all for a greetings card company
  and designed by their head artist, I wanted to try something completely different.
  They were hand-writing, scripty type fonts in a single weight so basically, I could
  get away with a lot and it was a good way to begin.\r\n\r\nAfter doing these fonts
  I decided to make a font of my own but wanted to try a much more rigid sans serif
  to counter what I had already done. A little more disciplined if you like. It is
  quite a heavy font so I have decided to add a lighter weight which brings me back
  to why I'm posting.\r\n\r\nI was looking at Bodoni Egyptian Pro by Nick Shinn, especially
  the wonderful PDF that you can download from MyFonts. In the 'Evolution' section
  Nick explains how it has come to be in it's present form but if you were starting
  this again, what would your approach be to the weights and italics? \r\n\r\nI know
  you can alter the weights globally in Fontlab, with all it's pitfalls and advantages,
  but this does get you on your way and moving in the right direction. Any insights
  on methodology would be mostly appreciated as I am struggling a little with this
  and going in circles.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for all the outstanding knowledge
  in this forum.\r\n\r\nPaul"

    shift and use that in the background as a guide.\r\n\r\nAnd some rules of thumb:
    darker weights need more contrast, more width, tighter spacing, and a higher x-height.\r\n\r\nMore:\r\n-
    Weights often get used in pairs, so plan them accordingly.\r\n- Setting light-on-dark
    text makes a font look lighter; if you have a fine enough weight gradation you
    can build in an accommodation of this (meaning the color of weight_n will look
    equal to weight_n+1 reversed).\r\n- You can make a -narrow- range of weights uniwidth
    (meaning changing the weight doesn't affect linebreaks). Beyond this range you
    can still use a favorite trick of mine: make them \"fixed offset\", which means
    applying let's say +5 tracking to the Light makes it uniwidth with the Regular.\r\n\r\nSee
    also De Groot's non-linear scaling method (which some people don't believe in
    however).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    by Yanone and Hasebe) of making each weight/style its own animal (it seems too
    self-indulgent, and really, that's what different fonts are for) I do think there's
    a threshold beyond which a weight is too light/dark to be used as a text face
    and that means it can -and probably should- have a different nature.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your insight hrant.\r\n\r\nOne thing I am certainly not doing
    is making the lighter weight its own animal. To me, the whole point of different
    weights is to keep a continuity throughout the face. I do tend to agree that if
    one decides to make them too different it should be a different font.\r\n\r\nYou
    have given me some avenues to pursue."
