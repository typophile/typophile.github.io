body: so for "real" [[small capitals|smallcaps]], should they be the same height as
  the x-height? or can they be taller? is it just a matter of taste? or is there some
  rule that says they must be as tall (or short) as the x-height?

  body: 'I think it&#39;s important that smallcaps be visibly larger than the x-height,
    because otherwise they: look too small, since they have no extenders; and they
    can get confused, like think of &#34;US&#34;. Most smallcaps seem too small to
    me. <BR> <BR>BTW, the same goes for old-style numerals. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: the reason i ask is i was putting something together last night and using
    FB Californian and it was hard for me to tell the small caps from lowercase in
    places like &#34;Mac OS&#34; and just looked funny in places like &#34;HTML.&#34;
    <BR>is 3/4 cap height too tall for smallcaps in these kinds of situations?

  body: '&#62; should be slightly wider and bolder. <BR> <BR>You mean bolder relative
    to size, I assume. <BR>Also, I think they should be looser too. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    ... i&#39;ll put it in another thread. <BR> <BR>When you do I&#39;d also like
    to ask something, about Delicato&#39;s italic. <BR> <BR>hhp'
