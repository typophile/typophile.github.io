  added a new Book style with its accompanying italic to our successful type family
  Maiola. It is darker in colour, making reading an even more pleasant experience.
  Additionally, responding to customer feedback, we have also designed a whole set
  of symbols used to set logic. Customers who have purchased the Maiola Bundle and
  would like to add the Book styles, are welcome to a special offer. Please contact
  us, if interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.type-together.com/Maiola|More information
