  body: "You can check <strong>[[http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/9220|Do not eat
    this Italic]]</strong> by Jakob Fischer\r\nbut I still believe this must be custom
    or heavily customized.\r\n\r\nCan you upload an image of the second design you
    encountered?\r\n"

  body: "Hmmm, yea that's pretty close. Thanks for replying. Here's the other design
    I noticed with what looks to be the same face. I'm wondering if they are using
    artificial italics in both samples. \r\n\r\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/5448314/cargo.heartbreaker.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe
    it's the same designer reusing his own custom typeface. How sweet would it be
    if those were opentype swashes though. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "There was certainly some distorting and customization involved.\r\nA good
    starting point could be Labtop Secundo Bold or Labtop Unicase:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/labtop.font\r\nor\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/fonts_tt_02/Labtop.zip\r\n\r\nNot
    a perfect match, but I hope it helps...\r\n"
