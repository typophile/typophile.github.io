body: "(I originally posted this in the FontLab support forum, but y'all are pretty
  active here, and I'm in a bit of a panic mode, so pardon the bad habit.)\r\n\r\nHi
  folks, I'm having a strange issue with a monospaced TrueType font on Windows, and
  I'm wondering if anyone will have seen something like this before.\r\n\r\nThe custom
  font in question is designed to match a different custom font, and the metrics are
  supposed to match exactly.\r\n\r\nOn Windows 7, the font renders as non-monospaced,
  with more space given to certain characters (o, L, P). Additionally, certain characters
  seem to be dramatically shifted within their bounding box, such that they run into
  their neighbors (particularly the uppercase i). There's also too much leading. On
  a Mac, everything shows up fine, properly monospaced.\r\n\r\nThe font has no TT
  instructions, but I tried a quick autohint and saw yet different metrics, both horizontal
  and vertical. But in spite of the hinting having a profound effect on the metrics,
  it doesn't seem like strictly a hinting issue, because the font renders with the
  same problems at all sizes.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, sometimes it doesn't render
  at all. In Final Draft, it appears correctly in the font and renders the expected
  font on screen. In Wordpad, it appears in the font menu, but renders as Arial.\r\n\r\nI'm
  wondering if this is a FontLab bug, because if I just open the original custom font,
  rename it, and regenerate it, it exhibits the same problems, while the original
  font renders just fine.\r\n\r\nAttached are two images, one for Mac and one for
  Windows. Has anyone seen anything like this before?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\nAlan\r\n"

    on a different Windows machine?\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n\r\n1. Uninstall the font.\r\n2.
    Delete this file: C:\\Windows\\System32\\FNTCACHE.DAT\r\n3. Restart your system.\r\n4.
    Re-install the font.\r\n\r\nIf the problem persists after that, then there may
    be some piece of information in the font that is causing the problem, but that
    would not be my first guess."

  body: "Thanks, John. I haven't tried your suggestion (I don't own a Windows machine,
    so it's hard for me to test quickly), but the same thing is happening on two different
    machines, neither of which have ever had any version of this font installed.\r\n\r\nI'll
    try testing some unrelated fonts, and maybe do a fresh copy/paste into a new file
    to see if there's something corrupted in my VFB. Thanks for your quick response."

    the Panose value for monospaced is set in the Panose / Proportion font info.\r\n\r\nc)
    Ensure that the TrueType Unique ID record in the font info identification settings
    is indeed unique to this font and can't be confused with anything else."

      make nice emdashes and such, I'll have to look into replacing those with many-to-many
      substitutions. I did try a version on Windows with those extra-wide characters
      removed, but hadn't done most of these other suggestions, so it had no effect.\r\n\r\nThanks
      again for your time, I'm itching to get back on that PC and try these out."

  body: "Hi again, I've done some more testing, and haven't had any better luck. I
    converted all my double-wide characters to regular width, so all glyph widths
    are the same. Exporting as PS, opening in FontLab, exporting TT didn't work. Copy/paste
    into new VFB didn't work. I was careful to clear the Windows font cache and make
    sure everything had unique names and IDs.\r\n\r\nIt turns out I was wrong about
    it being consistent at all sizes. Different characters are wider or narrower at
    different sizes.\r\n\r\nStranger still, the italics work fine, mostly. I'm not
    getting any odd spacing with italics, though they don't match the metrics of the
    original custom font. I started with the regular, then used that as a basis for
    the italic, bold, and bold italic, so I'm not sure what's so special about the
    italics that they're less problematic.\r\n\r\nI was just about to test various
    smoothing settings, but I've now run into an issue where installing any new fonts
    causes them to disappear, and can't be used in applications. This is apparently
    a Windows 7 bug, so I'm not sure what testing I can do next.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
    have any more ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlan"

  body: Ok, I am, quite possibly, a horrible human being. I unknowingly had "autohint
    unhinted glyphs" on TT export turned on. And with it, "add link to right sidebearing
    point", which seems like it would do exactly the kind of damage I'm seeing. Will
    test tomorrow ...

  body: Turns out that autohinting on the right sidebearing was the culprit. Well,
    now I know. Still wrestling with the vertical metrics, I'll start a separate thread
    if needed. Thanks again for all of your suggestions!
