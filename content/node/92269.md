body: I saw a scan of the front-page of this 1898 French newspaper, and it's captivated
  me. I know it's highly unlikely there's an exact match, being so old, but something
  close would be awesome too. It's somewhat like Landry Gothic, but it's different
  in the shape of the R and the E's subtle slope down on the top leg, and therefore
  has too contemporary a feel.
