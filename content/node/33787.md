    body: "<strong>pattyfab</strong> Good question. The current setup is due to Adobe's
      Indesign settings when I have the optical margin alignments on. Ill try to flush
      them with the type instead.\r\n\r\n<strong>auricfuzz</strong> Thanks for noticing
      the problem. It's rather a dilemma here as the next two which aren't in italics
      is basically two paragraphs by the same person. All interviews consists of the
      interviewee and the interviewer.\r\n\r\nPersonally I feel that the em dashes
      helps in directing the eye to the beginning of the question/answer quicker.

  body: "Well, I find the way you implemented it to be a bit confusing. The first
    bit of dialogue is in italic, suggesting a question, but the next two are not.
    Are there multiple people responding? If there are, then you need some way to
    differentiate between the two -- and the em dash method on its own won't work
    well. But if it's just one person's response in multiple paragraphs, then you
    shouldn't put an em dash in the second paragraph -- it makes it seem like there's
    another person talking. Instead, just indent paragraphs until the next question
    is asked. You might find, though, that italicizing and screening the questions
    may do enough to differentiate them from the answers, so no need for em dashes.\r\n\r\nIn
    summary, it can work fine, but you need to refine it."

  body: "I would agree with the others that this needs some work, though not particularly
    with the suggestions -- except the one that you use a new dash only when there
    is a new speaker.\r\n\r\nThe partially outdented dash doesn't bother me too much
    visually -- an alternate treatment would be to outdent the first words of a new
    speaker -- but it does structurally. One part of using a dash is that it keeps
    some of its regular meaning.\r\n\r\nI've been involved in some interesting arguments
    on em dashes. Richard Eckersley, a product of the London College of Printing,
    use to argue in favor of the word-spaced en dash. He argued that a dash separates
    two thoughts, whereas a closed-up emdash visually appears to join them. I finally
    got him to agree that another way to describe a dash is that it joins two thoughts
    without the grammatical work usually needed. Whether you describe a dash as joining
    or separating involves a bit of whimsy. We finally settled on a 3/4-em long dash
    centered in an em space as the perfect dash for normal use.\r\n\r\nNow how is
    this relevant? Again, because I think the dash viewed as a character carries some
    of its usual meaning in this context. It isn't simply that a dash is more graceful
    than a bullet. If all you want is a visual separator, you could use almost anything.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, this is what is know as a design problem -- you need a cue, and it can be
    visual or grammatical, or both, and which you choose has an effect. So make it
    one you want.\r\n\r\n&BTW, this appears to be 2-columns, with the attendant short
    measure.  You could get by with an en-dash or 3/4 dash is space is a concern.\r\n\r\nFWIW

    body: "<strong>charles_c</strong>Firstly, thanks for your opinion. I'd certainly
      look into switching to a 3/4 em dash if space is ever a huge concern.\r\n\r\nMy
      previous statement about the em dashes might sound misleading but the my main
      intentions of using the em dash is to reduce the repetition of the names. The
      usage of the em dashes within an interview itself works well in indicating a
      continuing conversation. Each question and answer relates back to the previous
      one and so on. (More or less similar to your concept of a dash being able to
      join two thoughts)\r\n\r\nEnglish isn't my first language. So pardon me if I'm
      not getting my point across that well. \r\n\r\nDoes the em dash typgraphically
      speaking works within this context if I may ask."

  body: "<cite>Does the em dash typgraphically speaking works within this context
    if I may ask.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, yes and no. As you say, the dash removes the
    repetition of using the names. If the text clearly & quickly identifies the speaker,
    a dash works fine. But if the questioner asks long and thought-provoking questions,
    a reader might get confused as to who is speaking. In other words, you are relying
    on context to identify each speaker. If this is pretty clear, the dash works.
    If it isn't, another approach is needed. If you don't want ot use the full name,
    initials work too -- \r\n\r\n<cite>C.E.</cite> Don't apologize, English is my
    <cite>only</cite> language.\r\n\r\n<cite>H.C.</cite> (whatever you'd say, I don't
    want to put words in your mouth).\r\n\r\n<cite>C.E.</cite> (long, rambling question).\r\n\r\n<cite>H.C.</cite>
    (concise answer).\r\n\r\nEtc. The initials could be small caps, though that might
    look strange in this context. If the magazine is informal, the period could perhaps
    be omitted, check with an editor.\r\n\r\nI think something like this is what you
    were doing with the questioner's words set in italic, and the responder's words
    in roman, right? That works too, and with such a structure, the dash isn't needed,
    and might get in the way, since it can imply, as you say, a discontinuity.\r\n\r\nBut
    if the questions are short & obviously questions, there are only two speakers,
    and the answers clearly that, a dash will work fine.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nCharles"

    just use intro initials at the beginning of the article and at the beginning of
    a new section if the article is broken and continues elsewhere in the magazine.

  body: "I agree with Maxim -- I am used to seeing em dashes opening lines of dialogue
    in Spanish-language novels, but only because it is an established convention for
    that language. I expect them to be there. Whereas in English, I expect to see
    quotation marks (again, in a novel -- interviews can be set differently).\r\n\r\nJpad
    makes a great point, too. Whether you use bold or italics to differentiate the
    questions from the answers, you already have a way to tell the two speakers apart.
    Just add their initials, names, or \"Q\" and \"A\" at the beginning of the first
    two comments, and you are all set."

    (What follows is a bit off topic, I admit.)\r\n\r\nOne of my pet peeves is the
    un-thinking use of the em dash on book jackets and ad cards before the name of
    a blurber. I refuse to let such uses stand on/in books from our publishing house.
    In such uses the em dash is an utterly inappropriate marker. This holds true also
    for such things as epigraphs.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between a bit of text and
    its author can be entirely visual. We have typeface, weight, color, spacing, indent
    to do that job. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure when the practice began. But it is time for
    it to go.\r\n\r\nA well-fitted 3/4 em dash in text is a thing of beauty, though.\r\n\r\npowers"

    connected to the previous sentence or clause. As some point, the author's name
    below the blurb is not connected -- you don't say \"written by . . \" etc. Though
    as you say, there is a long history for finding the name below the quote (generally
    recognized visual clue).\r\n\r\nThe same is often true of subheads, by the way.
    Instead of saying (more eloquently) \"I'm through talking about <cite>this,</cite>
    now I want to talk about <cite>that</cite> -- i.e., a paragraph of transition,
    we just dump that paragraph & stick in a subhead. So, does it need to be bold,
    as is so often thought & taught? Or does it need to be bold only when the author
    is particularly opaque?"

    dash. This makes that \"connection\" work.\r\n\r\nIn the instance of jackets and
    covers, as well as epigraphs at chapter heads, etc: get rid of it. If I attribute
    a blurb or an epigraph through the use of a type change [most likely smalls or
    semibold], color, line feed, indent, etc., then even the thickest of readers will
    be able to comprehend the \"written by\" inherent in those visual changes.\r\n\r\npowers"
