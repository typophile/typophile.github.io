  body: Most everyday practical applications deal with numbers larger than one, and
    non-integers can usually be rounded to a consistent number of places after the
    decimal point. The arithmetic in people&#39;s ledgers is right-aligned. Now, if
    we were talking about a calculator that displays all numbers in scientific notation,
    <i>that</i> would be best left-aligned.
