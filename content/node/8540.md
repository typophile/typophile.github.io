body: 'Another faux-japanese face.  <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; I saw a magazine that used
  a &#39;faux-japanese&#39; face in its heds, but I can&#39;t remember the name. Fader?
  Vice? Anyone spot anything like this? <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; I would like to humbly
  submit a prediction that these types of faces &#40;done better than this!&#41; will
  become de rigeur in 2002. Can anyone point me to a font for sale in this category?
  <BR>&#62;&#62; I&#39;m going to try to perfect a family of faces in this category.
  Maybe &#39;complete&#39; is a better word. Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>
