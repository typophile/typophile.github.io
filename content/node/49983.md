    it's proprietary to the company.\r\n\r\nYou might dig <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_dumifu/\">FF

  body: "I've always liked that H & M logo. It is somewhere between a fairly restrained
    script and a traditional sign painters casual. A few others you might like which
    are closer to the latter category:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/eckhardt-speedletter/|Eckhardt

    the Ikea showcard font? If so that is something else I've always admired. I think
    it is a custom font of theirs.\r\n\r\n"
