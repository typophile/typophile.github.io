  body: Thanks. I appreciate the help. I know what you mean...it looks really familiar,
    but I am getting to the point where I believe I am hallucinating (or just confusing
    it with other fonts - yeah, we'll go with that!)

  body: "It is very calligraphic and I think it has a Scandinavian, and or German,
    feel to it but I have been off the mark many times before.\r\n\r\nI am really
    interested in finding this one. I am still looking, it has a Lindegren, Forsberg
    or Gudrun Zapf (I know it is not her) feel to it. Check out Diotima Italic by
    Gudrun Zapf and you will see what I mean.\r\n\r\nMichael"
