body: "I need to create a poster with late 1800s/early 1900s typestyles.  Kind of
  just wondering what my typeface options might be.  I'm attaching some examples of
  old sign bits as an example of the types of faces I'm looking for.  Nothing has
  to be exact here, just need some nice similar styles get get the feel of these old
  signs.\r\n\r\nThis sort of rustic sans serif is something I could definitely use
  suggestions for--have nothing for these.\r\n\r\nAlso, as a pt.2, is LHF Billhead
  pretty much the only font that captures that old sign style typeface?  I have LHF
  Billhead and will probably use it, but really haven't found anything else to consider
  as alternatives just to try other designs.  Usually I like to try more than one
  thing.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
