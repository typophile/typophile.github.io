  a scan of an old Los Angeles Railway Ticket (don't know the exact year, but somewhere
  between 1910 and 1930 I'd say.... Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_5644.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  also have this \"10c\" font I want to identify (scanned fromm the same ticket).
  Probably the numbers and the letter c are two different font, I don't know...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font2_3675.jpg]"

  body: You're talking about the numbers then, I assume? Does anyone have an idea
    of the first font (LAMC LARY part)?

    come very close are welcome...
