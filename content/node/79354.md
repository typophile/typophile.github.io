  \ Secondly, I'm sorry if this is a weird question to ask, but I am wondering what
  is said about the wingdings series from IBM platforms ca. Windows 3.1 - But in thinking
  about issues of design construction and use of negative space in lettering, how
  do the dingbat symbols composing the wingdings series stack up?  \r\n\r\nAre these
  symbols chosen based on popularity, familiarity, etc.  What are the reasons for
  iconographic preference given to certain symbols over others, and how were they
  finally decided upon as \"canonical\" wingdings?  How often are you using symbols
  from the original Wingdings lineup?  \r\n\r\nWhat are these symbols, who was involved
  in the designing, and how did it all come about?\r\n"

  body: AFIK, Wingdings were Microsoft's answer to Zapf Dingbats, with the addition
    of several computer-related icons. With either typeface, the scissors and checkboxes
    sometimes come in handy...

  body: I thought there was one icon font that was "an answer" to MS need to "cover"
    Zapf Dingbats, and WingDings was a separate extended effort to offer more icons
    n such?

  body: thanks for the feedback here folks.  Seems there is still some uncovering
    to be done as to who is responsible for all of those web images, Its a good start
    here though.  I hadnt heard about Bigelow and Holmes or Zapf Dingbats yet so I
    am pleased already, thanks again!

  body: "WingDings was definitely designed by Holmes & Bigelow way before Win3.1 it
    was finished when Microsoft and IBM were testing font technologies for 'Presentation
    Manager' back about 1989-90 because we had to test hint them in Intellifont for
    Apple!  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/09/47042?currentPage=1\r\n\r\nand
    I can tell you for sure the glyph order was always the same up until the final
    Release Candidate of Windows 3.1. We printed out the Ikarus outlines and had them
    in a book for the production process. When Windows 3.1 shipped we found that Microsoft
    added the Windows logo to the final glyph position and this was probably why other
    glyphs were moved. I later found out (when we were doing Webdings) that the legal
    department 'hit the roof' when they found out the Windows logo was added. They
    told me DEFINITELY NO you can not put the Internet Explorer logo into Webdings.

  body: "The original plan for Windows 3.1 was to ship a large set of the Lucida&reg;
    fonts from Bigelow & Holmes. But alas, those were the days of 5-1/4\" floppies
    and we ran out of space for those fonts on the Windows disks. Three of the fonts
    from the Lucida collection were Lucida Arrows, Lucida Icons, and Lucida Stars.
    We decided to take some of the glyphs from each of these fonts and combine them
    into one font, Wingdings.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Lucida fonts shipped in parallel
    to Windows 3.1 in the Microsoft TrueType Font Pack for Windows."
