  and contemplating about using Canada Type's Semplicita for the logo - and potentially
  for more. I'm intrigued by its combination of Futura geometry and the humanist shapes
  - somehow sits well with my ideals of modern Architecture, rooted in the modernist
  era of the early 20th century but less rigid and ideological.\r\n\r\nHaving said
  that, I'm less sure about suitability of Semplicita as a text font, say for brochures,
  letters, certificates and the like. Any comments on that? And if not suitable in
  your eyes, what would a good complementary sans serif text font be?"

    helps Semplicit\xE0 here is its modest x-height, since ascenders contribute a
    lot to immersive reading. So: you could do worse! But if you're set on using a
    sans, and must deliver a lot of text, do also consider Legato - see the last entry
    here:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/on-typography/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2004/\r\n\r\nWhat
    would be ideal is if you could commission a large\u2013x-height version of Semplicit\xE0
    for uses besides running text. If you could come up with a budget for that, there
    are a number of people here who could do that for you, including Claudio Piccinini*...
    and yours truly**.  :-)\r\n\r\n* http://www.typophile.com/user/1316\r\n\r\n**

    has some of the feel of Gill Sans in text setting.

  body: "I wish to thank Hrant, for the heads-up, but I think that for the branding
    of an architectural firm makes more sense, and is also more economical, to license
    a pre-existing typeface. At least that\u2019s my opinion, I have never done type
    design on commission, and I generally feel uncomforable about the idea of designing
    a typeface, albeit derived, on a schedule.\r\n\r\n@filoug: I don\u2019t know how
    much you care about faithfulness, but Canada Type Semplicita doesn\u2019t represent
    a faithful adaptation of Semplicit\xE0: there are forms \u2013 even signature
    forms \u2013 modified and arbitrarily straying from the original alphabet. If
    you have to choose an existing font family to licence, there would be Durotype
    Simplo, but some letters are really badly drawn (i.e. the [a], for which it seems
    they took a single size as a model, possibly a small one, and then redrawn it
    quite loosely.\r\n\r\nRather than using either of those, I\u2019d suggest you
    to look for the qualities you are looking for in a recent design. Kris Sowersby\u2019s
    [[http://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/karbon|Karbon]], for example, blends very skillfully
    different influences \u2013 Butti\u2019s Semplicit\xE0 being among them, and is
    also very well drawn and produced. May be more costly, but always less costly
    than commissioning a custom typeface. :)"

  body: "Hrant, thanks for pointing me towards [[http://www.typophile.com/node/79597|/node/79597]]
    which I had overlooked during my search. Very interesting indeed. I do go with
    Piccic though and think that commissioning my own font would probably be slightly
    over the top in my case. \r\n\r\nPiccic, I hate to say it, but faithfulness to
    the original Semplicit\xE0 is not on the top of my list of priorities (I'm an
    architect, not a typographer after all!). I've had a look at Simplo which as you
    say may be closer to the original; it seems slightly 'over the top' for me though
    (the [t] for example) - not really that 'simple' as the name suggests? \r\n\r\nThanks
    for pointing me towards Karbon which I had not come across before. Looks nicely
    assembled and as you say well produced, but I really don't like the bold [e] which
    is too much of a Gill offspring, and the [m] generally doesn't work for me.\r\n\r\nIn
    case I end up with Canada Type's Semplicita, what would in your eyes be a good
    complementary <em>serif</em> text font?"
