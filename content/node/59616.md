  body: "Sounds like you have reasons to be upset. Too bad, the economy is not good
    and projects plummet. You would find that you are not the only one who is experiencing
    this. Not the right time to be too choosy, though.\r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions:\r\n\r\n1.
    Do you need extra money? If they pay well, stay there first until you find a permanent
    job. Having extra cash would be helpful in bad time. \r\n\r\n2. Even if you leave
    now, there is no guarantee you would get a job immediately. You probably end up
    doing the same thing at home- \"do your own works\", \"doing small task in photoshop\"etc...
    on top of that, no one pay you for doing that. \r\n\r\n3. There are actually lot
    of things you can do while waiting to get a real job- continue \"educating\" yourself
    is one of them. You would find that once you start working you would be so tied
    up with deadlines that you wish you have time to do those things that help your
    personal development, such as reading some books and articles, working on a personal
    creative project, research on a particular topic etc...\r\n\r\n4. Network, network,
    network... go back to your teacher and ask him/ her to refer you to someone who
    can also refer you to someone else who can give you a job...\r\n\r\n5. Take initiative
    to call up agencies and design houses- what are some of your dreamed design agencies
    ? Do you have any heroes or design idols in where you live? Is your portfolio
    measured up to their standard? Call them up for a meeting. most of the time you
    would find sitting down with them really helps, even though they might not have
    a job for you, they can give you some good advices. Most of these designers love
    to meet fresh graduates and see what they are up to.\r\n\r\nIf after meeting them,
    you find that your portfolio doesn't measure up to the industrial standard, then
    you have a task to do. Go back to your office and start \"bringing your own work\"
    and to work on your portfolio. The beauty of this is you still get paid to work
    on your own thing. Isn't that a blessing?\r\n\r\n6. If there are limited opportunities
    in where you live, consider other cities, and even other countries. \r\n\r\nHope
    this help. All the best."

  body: "First of all, feel lucky that you got the internship. A lot of people would
    like to be in your shoes. The economy is bad everywhere, and it's going to be
    that way for a while, probably. \r\n\r\nSecondly, even at full-time, paid positions,
    there will be times when there is little or nothing to do. So, as Yee suggests,
    look at the free time as an opportunity to learn new skills, i.e., learn some
    Web design. If you have questions, you have three people there who can help you
    out. Or as your bosses said, work on your own stuff.\r\n\r\nLast but not least,
    if you ride this internship out, you will have something to put on your r\xE9sum\xE9.
    If you leave now, you won't.\r\n\r\nThink about it."

  body: "What I would do, would depend on what kind of internship it is. Was it arranged
    via school or part of your school program? If so, I would seriously consider to
    quit, especially if you feel that you're wasting your time. I mean, if you have
    to bring your own work, they don't have to offer you much with regards to knowledge.
    If the agency isn't that good, it isn't interesting to put on your resum\xE9 either.\r\n\r\nIn
    my school career I've heard about many fellow students quitting because of similar
    reasons. If it's via / for school, you might be able to find another agency? You
    are there to learn; if they can't offer that, then it's a waste of time. However,
    if the internship is only a few months, I don't know if it's worth the trouble
    of switching agency.\r\n\r\nIf it's an internship that has nothing to do with
    school, then I don't know, because it will be more difficult to find another spot.
    Then I would probably ride it out."

    recent account</a> of someone doing an internship at another studio. Forget about
    the studio he's working for, forget about the fact that he is much busier than
    you are. What I want you to notice is the writer's <em>attitude</em>. He is not
    expecting anyone to buy him lunch. He does not mind that he is working on small,
    non-design tasks (and cutting his fingers while doing it), or that he has very
    little contact with the partners. He is there to learn. In fact, he is there to
    learn as much as he can, and he can't believe his luck.\r\n\r\nYou will get out
    of this what you put into it."

  body: Don't wait for them to give you jobs. Figure out what needs to be done, and
    ask if you can do it. Or better yet, just do it and show it to them after you're
    done. The most important thing you can learn in an internship is how to work when
    nobody else is telling you what to do. Figure out what you can do that the rest
    of the staff can't. Really you just need an attitude change.

    are not getting paid at all, and you are not learning anything, and you are not
    happy being there, and you feel manipulated,... then you should just quit, because
    you are wasting your time at a fruitless activity. \r\n\r\nTime is bad. Focus
    your energy on survival plan and strategy.\r\n\r\nIf there is no contract signed,
    no commitment of any sort, no obligation in anyway just moonwalk out of the door...NOW.\r\n\r\nweng"

    don't forget to include the company name in you resume. As a fresh graduate, to
    have a job experience on your resume when you go for interview is always better
    than not having one at all.  \r\n\r\n: )\r\n\r\nAll the best\r\n\r\nweng"

    have a clue what I was doing. The pay was bad, I didn\u2019t get any portfolio
    work out of it, and aside from learning a bunch of Indesign hotkeys I didn\u2019t
    walk away with much. But the next summer having that on my resume helped me land
    a job in a design agency where there was a nasty lull and I spent most of the
    days on thesis research and designing my first (and thankfully unreleased) font.
    But the year after that I got a great internship with a very generous stipend
    and produced some really great printed pieces for my portfolio. And if the economy
    wasn\u2019t in the tank I\u2019d probably have a pretty nice job between the three
