  I immediately showed two friends and my husband, all of whom said \"that's cool...
  um, does it say something?\"  Well, *I* can read it clear as day, but I'm beginning
  to think that there's a only a small corner of the population who shares that skill
  (and interest).\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I just stumbled on this website and forum and
  have spent the last hour perusing old posts.  I think I'm in the right place!  \r\n\r\nSo,
  my question for you is, how hard is it for *you* to read?  (Really, I'm just trying
  to get a grasp on how far exactly 'out there' I am, or if I'm lucky and there is
  some normalcy to be found in this group....)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nfrom The Newbie\r\n\r\n(p.s.
  I drew this by hand with a pencil, then played with a scan of it in Illustrator;
  so it's technically not a font... I hope this post still fits here!)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thankyou_3959.jpg]"

    \r\n\r\nYou might separate out the \"T\" more, to give the viewer a clearer starting
    point. "

    of the two strokes in ''h'', making them harder to distinghuish from one another.

    the end...'

  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments.  Yes, indeed it does say 'thank
    you'.  \r\n\r\nWell, after reading even more of this forum (with great enthusiasm!),
    I've realized that it's almost exclusively about typefaces, nothing really 'out
    of the box' of this sort.  Sorry and I hope you enjoyed the diversion.  I'll still
    certainly be poking around here checking out the wealth of information about individual
    types.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
