    of the original handset type, warts and all.  Moving at a 90 degree angle away
    from the perfection usually sought here, I'd have him take a look at this site.
    \ These are H.P. Lovecraft reenacters (a very obsessive bunch) and have scanned

  body: "Found the e-mail, this is what Juliet Shen had to say:\r\n\r\n<em>The date
    is too early to be any of the Century family. I believe it's \"Modern No. 512\"
    based on the specimen showing in the \"Modern and Oldstyle Faces Shown by Sizes\"
    section of the 1906 American Typefounders Co. catalog, p. 9, allowing for ink
    spread. The generic name and the lack of a family specimen page point to its being
    a legacy typeface inherited by ATF, so it could be from the period in question,
    which predates the founding of ATF. A similar face in display size appears on
    p. 220 of McGrew's book (American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century, 2nd
    rev ed), called \"Modern Roman Lightface\" from the Barnhart  Brothers & Spindler
    foundry, but I don't have an old enough specimen book to see if there was a text
    size to match your sample. BB&S was established in 1868, according to their specimen
    book, and later became part of ATF. Given the date of the sample, it could have
    been a BB&S foundry font, or a similar font from another foundry.</em>"

  body: "Just got this one in from John D. Berry. I guess we can consider this case
    closed:\r\n\r\n<em>Thanks for all the suggestions. I'll pass them on. Especially
    thanks to Juliet for the specific information on a possible source, and to Jay
    and Albert-Jan for good suggestions as to possible equivalents that are available
    today. To answer Will's question, yes, Bill is looking for a practical equivalent,
    since he'd like to republish the book (apparently it's quite rare, yet of interest
    to those in this particular field -- a bit like our fascination with the minutiae
    of type). The inking in his sample is wonderfully dark; most digital versions
    of 19th-century moderns are too light to give the same impression.</em>"
