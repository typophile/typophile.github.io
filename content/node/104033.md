body: "The \"ILANO\" seems to be like Futura squished and with the edges of the letters
  angled (in Futura the lower part of the L does that already) and with the A missing
  the crossbeam, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\n\"RISTORANTE ITALIANO\" - Impact?\r\n\r\nThe
  M looks like a squished Times New Roman?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nfS4m1c.jpg\"
