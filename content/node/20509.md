  (see below) and in dire need of some feedback/help. I feel that most of letters
  work fine, but especially the Y is troubling me. So i am grateful for any constructive
  criticism.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yessirconcept_4866.png]"

  body: "Personally, from an aesthetic vantage point, i like the terminal of the Y
    that matches the terminal of the S - the very first letter Y in your first post.
    \r\n\r\nI know that the letter I with rounded ends does not really match any other
    letter, but it's funky and occupies less space that the solid vertical letter
    in the last sketch. It allows for more breathing room for the letters beside it.\r\n\r\nNo
    funky counters for the e and r? small pin hole circles like those in records?
    With the two different colours in use, why not push the two words together? (Random
    thoughts!)"

  body: "James & Andi,\r\n\r\nthank you so much for your helpful feedback. \r\n\r\n<cite>you
    could split the Y at the top</cite> - thats a really nice idea as i was never
    that happy with the semi-circle holes. \r\n\r\n<cite>i like the terminal of ...
    the very first letter Y in your first post</cite> - i think with the added split
    that this will be the one.\r\n\r\n<cite>With the two different colours in use,
    why not push the two words together? (Random thoughts!)</cite> - not random at
    all ;) the final logo will overlap on S's - so we are thinking a like...\r\n\r\nBack
    to Illustrator and i ll post an update later."

  body: "Y is a touch too high at the top where the top right interacts with the E
    (why is that lowercase? btw). My preference is for your third sample with no counters
    or semi-circles.\r\nTim"

  body: "Okay, here is an updated version that is really growing on me. it seems like
    a slight departure from the original concept, as i ended up adding more elements
    then i intended. But see for yourself:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yessir3_3736.png]\r\n\r\ntimd,
    there is no 'special' reason why the E is lowercase - it is just that with the
    elements i decided to use i couldn't make a capital E work. Maybe i gave in to
    easily?"

  body: "The kicking out leg of the R is an interesting idea - gives the letter more
    movement, leads your eye to the right. It does seem a tad wide though, as compared
    to the other vertical leg. The balance just seems a tad bit off, eh? \r\n\r\nThe
    same goes for the terminal on the Y. James' Y seems to be a bit better balanced
    up top. What do you think? \r\n\r\n(Oooo... an overlapped S - like that!)"

  body: "'Better balanced up top'. No.\r\nSebastian's hit the mark there, as I was
    strying to suggest a split that mimics the one at the terminal. I just did that
    very quickly.\r\n\r\nYes love the 'R'."

  body: You've given it a nice organic quality. The only thing troubling me right
    now is that where the E meets the S is the only place where two sharp edges meet.
    I like the shape they make - but maybe you could go back to an earlier "I" so
    that it makes a similar join with the R (which I love too - mirrors the Y nicely)
    or flip it so the sharp edge meets the S. I dunno.
