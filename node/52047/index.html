  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey everyone</p>
<p>I thought this would be my best hope of settling a question raised at work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting together some brand guidelines for a client and the corporate typeface I&rsquo;m proposing is Lineto&rsquo;s TYP1451.</p>
<p>Now my client is sourcing numerous design companies to produce booklets, brochures and posters. My question is: Does each company working on their corporate materials have to purchase the typeface, or is it just a case of my client buying a multi-user license and supplying it on demand to each design company working on it&hellip;?</p>
<p>Any help  on this issue would be greatlu appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks
M</p>

<p>Emphatically YES. And designers get really pissed when clients email us the fonts and claim that they don’t nneed to be paid for.</p>
<p><cite>…or is it just a case of my client buying a multi-user license and supplying it on demand to each design company working on it?”</p>
<p>If you’re interested in that kind of license, you’ll need to work out a deal with Lineto. Contact them directly.</p>

<p>If someone sends me an ad and states that I need to purchase the font, can that person give the outlined version of the font instead of spending hundreds of dollars on a font that I will probably never use again?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rican,</p>
<p>I think the key to your question is the word probably.  Speaking as a designer (and not a lawyer) I&rsquo;d have no problem with your client sending you the font for one off use on a project for them provided:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They had sufficient licensing to cover the copy sent to you in addition to any others they might have in use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That you delete the font immediately the project is finished, and don&rsquo;t leave it sitting around on your system to &lsquo;probably&rsquo; not be used - but then maybe come in useful for another project one day (say in three year&rsquo;s time) when you&rsquo;ve forgotten all about where it came from in the first place.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m no lawyer and that&rsquo;s just my personal viewpoint, others may well feel differently.  In any event, the cost of purchasing a license yourself would seem to be an expense that can legitimately be passed on to the client.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rican, Not many fonts cost &lsquo;hundreds of dollars&rsquo;. Most are between $10-$50 depending on the character set and versatility.</p>
<p>Rasendyll, Be careful giving that kind of advice (I acknowledge that you say you are &lsquo;not a lawyer&rsquo;) but the user must check the license (it may not allow off-site use) and if they have any queries about what they can do with the font, to check with the distributor or the foundry.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So, building on this, could someone answer this question for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known of Major Toy Companies who release a current Style Guide and throughout that Style Guide in various Art displayed on the pages, they will use x amount of fonts from various Foundries. They have bought them to display in their Style Guide, but the Style Guide might go out to a thousand supplier/makers on behalf of that Major Toy Company. At the back of the Style Guide they will have a list of the fonts and where to buy them.</p>
<p>So say, someone (an individual supplier) is producing large bouncing balls&hellip;
He sees that he can get a Font from that Style Guide by also buying from the same Foundry.</p>
<p>But then this Supplier goes ahead and produces 200,000 large bouncing balls with the Toy Company&rsquo;s Character/logo etc and the Font Designer&rsquo;s Font.</p>
<p>In a License, how does the Font Designer protect him or herself from this mass usage of his Font?
The supplier&rsquo;s Graphic Design Department probably bought the Font as if they were less than a Commercial enterprise. The balls go to another part of the world were the Font Designer never sees them.</p>
<p>Just life?&hellip;or can you have a clause against mass usage of a Font?
Is the original Major Toy Company liable?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new to Font Design and Font protection, so I&rsquo;d love any feedback.
Cheers
