body: "Sheesh. I'm sure there is an excel help group on the web, but I'd rather ask
  you guys first.\r\n\r\nI was giving a list of names, addresses, and birth dates.
  They are organized by last name and I need them organized by birth date. Is this
  possible and is the way to do it understandable?"

  body: "Assuming the birth dates are in a column by themselves, yes, it is quite
    easy.\r\n\r\nHighlight all the rows you need to include (that would be the entire
    document, then, excluding headers and footers). Go to Data -> Sort, and choose
    the column letter (or column name, if it\u2019s been given a proper header) that
    holds the Birth Dates from the drop-down menu under \u201CSort by\u201D.\r\n\r\nIf
    you wish, you can then add a secondary parametre (and even a tertiary), by choosing
    one of the remaining columns\u2014for instance Last Name, and then First Name\u2014from
    the two \u201CThen by\u201D drop-down menus underneath. This will make sure that,
    in the instance there are more than one person born on the same day in your sheet,
    they will be sorted alphabetically according to their last name; and if their
    last names happen to be the same, too, they will be sorted alphabetically according
    to their first name.\r\n\r\nThis applies to the Mac OS X version (more specifically
    Office 2004). I\u2019m not sure if the menus are called the same in the Windows
    version\u2014and if you have the newest version of Office (Office X or whatever
    it\u2019s called), then I\u2019ll have to defer to others, since I can\u2019t
    remember which of those horrendous pseudo-tabs Microsoft have decided to hide
    the sorting function under."

  body: Thanks for replying, Janus. This helps. Is there a way to get it to disregard
    the year? Meaning just organize the entire list by month instead of year?

  body: "That might be tougher. I\u2019m no Excel guru, but this might work:\r\n\r\nSelect
    the column that contains the birth dates. Right-click anywhere in the selection
    and choose \u201CFormat Cells\u201D. In the \u201CNumber\u201D tab, choose \u201CDate\u201D
    in the list at the left, and then choose the layout you want (if you want to sort
    by month, the \u201CMar-01\u201D and \u201CMarch-01\u201D options would be your
    best bet) and click OK.\r\n\r\nIf you sort by this column again, it should sort
    everything according to month (and for multiple instances of the same month, according
    to year, since it\u2019s still just sorting alphabetically). I\u2019m not 100
    per cent sure this will work, though, since the layout of the cell doesn\u2019t
    change the underlying content. Also, it requires well-formed, numeric dates, so
    if the dates are written as \u201C15 Mar 1976\u201D or something along those lines,
    it will probably just turn all the cells into random gibberish numbers."

  body: "Yeah, I had tried that hoping Excel might not be too smart, but it seems
    to not forget the year. :^/ Oh well. I've written to the people who sent me the
    information to see if they have a separate list.\r\n\r\nThanks again, Janus."

  body: "Add another column next to the one with the birthdates, and fill each cell
    with this:\r\n\r\n=text(B2,\"mm/dd\")\r\n\r\nwhere B2 is the address of the nextdoor
    cell with the date in it. That will put the text of the birthdate month/date in
    the cell.\r\n\r\nThen sort (per Oisin's instructions) on that new column."
