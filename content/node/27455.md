  look good on my Jornada (portable word processor), computer, or when printed out.
  I'm looking for a great, free font that would be perfect for a novel.\r\n\r\nYou
  know, like Times New Roman with a little spunk? Like Georgia but with some changes?
  Something that's easy on the eyes by oh-so-professional... and free. :) Can anyone
  help?\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "I'm no expert on the publishing biz, but generally doesn't the publisher
    pick the font (maybe in consultation with the author) and they likely have access
    to a bunch of quality text faces to choose from. I'm sure they can provide a list.
    \r\n\r\nSo as you're picking the font, I can only conclude that you're talking
    about the font for the manuscript that's being passed to publishers as you tout
    the work, or that you're self publishing. In either case the requirement of a
    free font (as opposed to a cheap quality font) seems very strange. I assume you
    put in many hundreds of hours into the novel, so why not present it in the best
    possible way? I'm sure people can think of other parallels but to me its kind
    of like a master brewer, spending many years to prefect a fine ale, only to present
    it at competition in a discarded milk bottle. Free fonts have their place - quickie
    projects, rave flyers, birthday invites - but using them for something you poured
    your heart and soul into just seems a bit sad. \r\n\r\nMaybe the subject material
    requires a free font? I suppose a book on <A HREF=\"http://www.areasofmyexpertise.com/\">hobo
    matters</A> or scifi conference attendees may benefit from a 2nd or 3rd rate type.

    be published in my community and distributed at some creative writing fair, for
    a price. It's kind of like a self-publishing press with few profits, I guess.
    After that, I'm going to submit the manuscript. Sorry I didn't explain it. Anyway,
    the community asked ME to make sure it's \"ready for the public\", and then they're
    going to print it... I'm kind of lost too, but I know I have to do this. :P.\r\n\r\n--

    body: "Hehe, clever. \r\n\r\nAs for quality fonts that won't break the bank (at
      all),\r\nI recommend:\r\n\r\nGentium (this one's a real beauty, but no small
      caps . . . yet)\r\n\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium\r\n\r\nI'm
      surprised this font is free. Alot of work went into it.\r\n\r\nAlso have a look
      at Cardo. I think it sets a bit too light on a laser or inkjet, but have a go
      with it.\r\n\r\nhttp://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html\r\n\r\nDay Roman is another
      possibility.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=day_roman\r\n\r\nIt
      should be noted, however, that there are a multitide of well-crafted and versatile
      fonts that are relatively inexpensive, and as such, are entirely worth the money.
      A good font very likely isn't something you'll use just once. You'll use it
      over and over again, and if you're truly happy with it, you'll find excuses
      to use it whenever you can (and whenever appropriate, of course.)"

  body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nJust a question. What operating system are you using? If
    you are using a mac, then you don't need to buy fonts perse. You can use Mac OS
    X's excellent system fonts. Hoefler Text being one of the most elegant type familes
    ever is perfect for your needs.\r\n\r\nBut if you are a non-mac user and your
    system fonts are not so hot then you CAN use a few good free fonts for serious
    fine typography.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Gentium is a fine choice and it
    has nothing even close to the feeling of free. It's a high quality font. This
    font won a Type Directors Club award (very prestigious) and it's a pretty good
    choice for basic book work. I'm sure of you set a piece in Gentium your collegues
    will remark how prefessional your work looks. \r\n\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/render_download.php?site_id=nrsi&format=file&media_id=Gentium_RU_spec&filename=Gentium_RU_spec.pdf\r\n\r\nAnother...\r\nhttp://www.greekfontsociety.org/pages/en_typefaces.html
    \r\n\r\nThe Greek Font Soceity has many classic looking typefaces for free that
    are suitable for book work. Their greek fonts have been recommended in the book
    \"The Elements of Typographic Style\"... which is considered the typographic 'bible'
    by some. So the romans might be worth a try.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, you need to check
    this website every month:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/features/free.cfm\r\n\r\nThe
    fonts that FONTSHOP gives away are high quality (sometimes award winning) commercial
    fonts- that are can be 'pricey'. You can save lots of money by visting that site
    every month. In a few months your can build an nice library of type without spending
    a dime. And despite the negative attitude some have toward free fonts, everyone
    participating in this forum checks the FontShop site religously to get the goods.
    Just recently they gave away Meta Book- something I would have NEVER purchased
    (boring) and Sanuk Fat which I like (quirky and tough at the same time) but probably
    would not get either. I have since been using them together and I really do love
    them now. AND NOW THAT FONTSHOP HAS ME ROPED IN, I'M GOING TO BUY MORE WEIGHTS
    OF BOTH VERY SOON... sometimes free is bad- it makes you poor. :-)\r\n\r\nBut
    David, I do recommend you invest in a 'proper' commercial type system suited to
    your needs. This garantees you have a consistant look that enables you to do anything
    you want typographically. There are many award winning high quality type famillies
    for south of $200. (Relato, Atlantica, Alinea etc- I think 170 is the sweet spot)
    And many less than $100. Tyrnavia is full featured type system great for setting
    text. Its only $49 comes loaded with ligatures and ornaments... no bold weight
    but you can get around that.\r\n\r\nYou can differentiate yourself (your style,
    your work) by investing a little at time. \r\n\r\nTake for example Linotype Really.
    I love this type familly but I can't purchase the whole thing right now... so
    what do I do? Since its only $22 a font and there are only four weights sold through
    Linotype. (BTW... don't discredit the large foundrys as always expensive- they
    have deals all the time.) I can get one font this week and may be one next week
    and so on and so on till I have the whole Really collection from Linotype. Or
    you contrast types the are free and commercial. Lets say I used Gentium for text
    and Poetica or Penumbra for headlines or subheads.\r\n\r\nAnyhow don't feel bad
    (or let anyone else make you feel bad) that your broke. No one else is gonna take
    care of you except for you. I think if you plan carefully and use the right combination
    of types (free or otherwise) your new book will be memorably beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll
    my best to you,\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Diaz"

    to me, and that's why I've only downloaded the regular and italic versions. \"Griffo
    FLNK\" is especially nice at the first look. \"Imperator\" is his own design and
    is a positive surprise for a free font.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning, though,
    that they may have some technical problems similar to Cardo.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd
    use these ones for display use only. For more display fonts with potential, I
    recommend browsing through <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein/\">Manfred
