  want to know is it possible in Microsoft Volt (preferably) or in FontLab to use
  the same glyph for alternate Ijam (Dots) placement? I have attached an Image explaining
  my query. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Graphic1_6056.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n
  \     For example I made a ligature in the font as the one on the right side of
  the image \"hahhahisolated\". Then I have to make eight more glyphs with the same
  shape but only Ijam (Dots) difference as shown in the Image. So In the font I have
  to assign the same shape to nine glyphs instead of one. As a result the number of
  glyphs increases too much in the font while I want to keep them less. How can I
  use only one glyph with Ijam variation on the same glyph in Microsoft Volt? If it
  is not possible in Volt than how can I do it in FontLab?\r\n\r\nPlease Help me............."

  body: "In my [[http://www.amirifont.org|Amiri]] font I used to have dots separated
    from base of the glyph, the idea is simple:\r\n\r\n* first you have a ccmp feature
    that decomposes the glyphs, something like (using feature file syntax):\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfeature
    ccmp {\r\n  sub haa  by haa.base;\r\n  sub khaa by haa.base dot.above;\r\n  sub
    jeem by haa.base dot.below;\r\n  ...\r\n} ccmp;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWhere <code>haa.base</code>
    is the dotless glyph, and <code>dot.above</code> and <code>dot.below</code> are
    zerowidth glyphs with mark glyph class.\r\n\r\n* from now on all glyph substitution
    is done on base glyphs, e.g.:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfeature init {\r\n lookupflag IgnoreMarks;\r\n
    \ sub haa.base by haa.base.init;\r\n  ...\r\n} init;\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n
    lookupflag IgnoreMarks;\r\n  sub haa.base.init haa.base.fina by haahaa.isol.liga;\r\n
    \ ...\r\n} liga;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe <code>IgnoreMarks</code> flag is very important,
    else the dots will interfere with the substitution.\r\n\r\n* lastly, you use anchor
    marks for placing dots just like tashkil marks.\r\n\r\n* some characters have
    different dot placement depending on their form, e.g. farsi yeh have dots only
    in final/isolated forms, for these characters you are better doing decomposition
    in init, medi etc. features, e.g.:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfeature init {\r\n  sub farsiyeh
    by yeh.base.init twodots.below;\r\n  ...\r\n} init;\r\n\r\nfeature fina {\r\n
    \ sub farsiyeh by yeh.base.fina;\r\n  ...\r\n} fina;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nHowever,
    this has some side effects, e.g. sometimes you need different kerning for glyphs
    with dots below than glyphs with dots above, sometimes certain dotted combinations
    don't go well together and you need to avoid ligatures in these combinations and
    this becomes tricky because the dots are treated as combining marks so you can't
    use them as context until you remove the <code>IgnoreMarks</code> flag and I ended
    up abandoning the idea.\r\n\r\n* A different strategy to decrease the number of
    glyphs is to avoid ligatures at all and use contextual forms instead. e.g. instead
    of the haahaa ligature above you \"cut\" the ligature into two parts:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n@clsHaaInit
    = [haa.init khaa.init jeem.init ...];\r\n@clsHaaFina = [haa.fina khaa.fina jeem.fina
    ...];\r\n@clsHaaInit.HaaHaa = [haa.init.haahaa khaa.init.haahaa jeem.init.haahaa
    ...];\r\n@clsHaaFina.HaaHaa = [haa.fina.haahaa khaa.fina.haahaa jeem.fina.haahaa
    ...];\r\n\r\nlookup haahaa.isol {\r\n  sub @clsHaaInit by @clsHaaInit.HaaHaa;\r\n
    \ sub @clsHaaFina by @clsHaaFina.HaaHaa;\r\n} hhaahaa.isol;\r\n\r\nfeature calt
    {\r\n  sub @clsHaaInit' lookup haahaa.isol @clsHaaFina' lookup haahaa.isol;\r\n}
    calt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSince we have 15 haa-like characters in Unicode, this cuts
    the number of glyph needed for this ligature from 15\xD715=225 (number of all
    possible combinations) to 15+15=30 (number of components).\r\n\r\n(PS. the names
    used above are arbitrary, you can use whatever glyph names you like).\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yes, this is possible, as Khaled describes. One thing to consider, though,
    is that this will break with Microsoft Office's options to display marks in different
    colours or not to display marks, since it has no way to distinguish dots treated
    in this way from other marks. This shouldn't necessarily stop you from doing this
    approach -- and for some styles of Arabic such as nastaliq it is the only sensible
    approach --, but it is something to be aware of and may result in some support
    contact from confused users.
