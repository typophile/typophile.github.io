  reading previous critiques and enjoyed them very much.  <BR> <BR>Two years ago I
  designed a logo for a media art festival pixelACHE. I am currently writing my thesis
  to end my studies. Describing how I created the visual identity for this festival
  is part of my thesis. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42420.gif"
  alt="pixelACHE-logo"> <BR> <BR>PixelACHE -festival aims to find and expose creativity
  in the gray zone between art, science and design. Term pixelache means the state
  of mind when one over consumes screen based media.   <BR> <BR>For more information
  and some history about the festival and logo evolution see: <BR><a href="http://www.pixelache.ac/"

  target="_blank">http://www.pixelache.ac/2002/</a> <BR> <BR>The logo consist of two
  parts. The purpose of word pixel is to mirror strong do-it-yourself attitude and
  working with computers. The ache part of the logo is ment to mirror the the emotional
  overload part of the festival. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to hear your critiques, thank
  you in advance for your comments. <BR> <BR>juha  <BR> <BR>'

  body: juha <BR> <BR>i liked how you worked the pixel type, but i do thin k that
    the contrast between pixel and ACHE is too much, it doesn&#39;t seem to fit right
    to me, i think that the extreme contrast is on the size of ACHE if we compare
    it with Pixel. <BR> <BR>CG <BR> <BR>BTW. The e of Pixel has a white point below
    the eye that i think you should remove it. <BR>

  body: '-The logo consist of two parts.  <BR> <BR>They are NOT inmersively connected
    between them, it look like two words near to another, but not as one. <BR> <BR>-The
    purpose of word pixel is to mirror strong do-it-yourself attitude and working
    with computers.  <BR> <BR>only the do it yourself attitude is implicit, because
    of the disorder in the drawing of teh pixel letters, there are a mediocre poor
    effort of balance. The pixel counterform is my reason to use the Mediocre word,
    sorry about that but is poor argument in your proposal. <BR> <BR> <BR>-The ache
    part of the logo is ment to mirror the emotional overload part of the festival.  <BR>
    <BR>ACHE is a bold, almost black, grotesk type. Can youi elaborate your meaning
    of emotional overload? <BR> <BR>keep on, <BR> <BR>mh. '

  body: 'I think my description about the do-it-yourself attitude and the emotional
    overload were a bit miss leading in the first place because they are more or less
    invented after the design was finished. Perhaps another example of do-it-yourself
    attitude and  even unprofessionality.  <BR> <BR>Here is how everything went. In
    year 2002 the input about the festival for me was: audiovisual experiments and
    creative misuse of technology, DIY lo-fi/hi-fi performances and installations,
    the art of programming. My intuitive response was this logo:  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42523.gif"
    alt="2002"> <BR> <BR>The idea was computer made vs. hand made &#43; my vision
    of ache/'

  body: 'Juha, <BR> <BR>I like that you avoided the cliche of using a word made up
    of pixels. However, I don&#39;t feel the logotype really captures the concept
    of art, science and technology. The hand drawn font although artistic, it also
    looks dated, like a 60&#39;s rock poster. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42644.jpg"
    alt="hendrix"> <BR> <BR>And the sans you selected is heavy, but to me, it doesn&#39;t
    convey &#34;emotional overload&#34; nor science/technology.  <BR> <BR>You are
    trying to communicate a lot of ideas and complex ideas too. &#40;Computers, Festival,
    Do-It-Yourself, Art meets Academic meets Commercial, Emotional Overload, All Are
    Welcome, Encourage Creativity, Fullness/Pain-Ache/Ahky, Control, Standardization,
    Process vs. Result&#41; Technology can work to your advantage here since a logo
    designed for the web can metamorphize into many things to help convey ALL of your
    concepts. But when it comes to print you will need to simplify and focus on one
    or two primary concepts. There are a lot of interesting visuals from the festival
    look to them for more inspiration. '

    in the know. I think you need a theme line or tag line to pull it together.

  body: The visuals are good imho, as they symbolize media. The logo doesn&#39;t remind
    me of digital media, so i like that there is other graphical elements that do
    so.

  body: By simplifying the message I didn&#39;t mean that the logo should stand alone
    in a void, but rather pick the main theme/message you are trying to communicate
    and focus on conveying that message. For example Art vs Technology, or Art in
    the Digital Media Age, or the Visual Overload one can get from viewing too much
    Digital Media, or Technology vs. Chaos. I think you are trying to get the logo
    to say too much and the end result is that the message is unclear. <BR> <BR>I
    like that you are using a hand-drawn font to represent art. Although it sounds
    like you want to communicate Digital Art specifically. The rectangle counters
    you have subtley allude to digital art but the first impression is 60&#39;s rock
    &#40;very un-digital&#41;. You may also want to re-think your font choice for
    Ache. Or at least how it&#39;s postioned. The obvious cliche solution to illustrate
    overload is to put Ache on top of Pixel. I am not recommending you do this, except
    as an exersize to play more with the words, letterforms, kerning, placement etc.
    Playing with these forms will spark more ideas and solutions. <BR> <BR>Your other
    visuals are interesting. I get a technological feel from them but it is more organic
    than chaotic. Your 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s seem like they are flowing down a river.
    Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, it just doesn&#39;t represent chaos.
    Or are these screen shots from video and the swirling symbols become more chaotic
    as the video progresses? <BR> <BR>Keep working on it I&#39;m looking forward to
    your next post.
