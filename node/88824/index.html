  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all!

Im designing a t-shirt for my university and I wanted to change their original logo to something more energetic.

Any and all feedback is appreciated!

		<div class="commentbody">1. I would apply the circle effect on the logo before I rotate it. In that way the line of circles will match the line of the logo.

2. The look of the circle effect is a little unprofessional/ Your graphic would look much cleaner (and also much more like a real logo) if you "draw" the circles yourself on adobe illustrator, or some other vector graphic software. Might take some time, but you will see that is worth it.

3. The grandient effect is out of place. I presume you wanted to achieve a shadow effect. To do so, just dim the second logo (all of it and with no grandient).

4. The easiest thing to change in a logo is the typeface that is used. While you pick, dont forget to pay homage to the original one.

Work hard, and the result will really be beautiful.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">to me - you have lost the original idea of the logo... the arrows creating an M - indicating the people coming to one place to create the university...

since heritage is proudly on display (1910) i can't help wonder if your modern twist sits awkwardly alongside

have you considered how the shirt will be manufactured? if it's screenprinting then the fade to white will look terrible and be very hard to control in process... resulting in dearer shirts and possible unusable/unsellable rejects. if you intend to use transfers - the longevity of print is compromised - the shirt will look crap in a few months after washing it a few times a month (hey - they are students!) also transfer prints tend to look 1970s/homemade... the shirt may not be popular with the students. 

your designs deliberately take the logo off centre - so i am assuming it will need to be large/overall printing

the only clear way to make this design is dye sublimation... expensive - but they will print the logo onto the fabric before constructing the shirts out of it... but the target market may resist buying shirts at twice/three times the price</div>

Is this an official project that's authorized by the university, or just a personal project? Will the t-shirts be sold?

Most universities do not want people making unauthorized variations of their logos, nor do they permit people to sell items (like t-shirts) containing their logo without purchasing a license from the university. If it's just some free t-shirts for a university event they probably won't care, but if you have plans to sell them, then you could get into legal trouble unless you have authorization.

A friend of mine works for a university and his full-time job is to license use of their logo, and to seek out and stop unauthorized use of their logo, and it's an issue they take very, very seriously because university-branded merchandise generates a lot of money.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is kind of funny.

The new Mount Royal logo is really nice, and was even picked as one of the top re-brands for 2011 on Brand New:

http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_best_and_worst_identities_of_2010_part_ii_the_best.php

Surely you can work with the logo itself to make a nice piece of art.

You are using half-tones/dots and gradients/transparency, which is a bit confused I think as the two effects are really not meant to mix in the traditional sense. To achieve a sense of transparency with half-tones you make smaller and more spaced-out dots. Which would look more honest than throwing a ball of photoshop light at it.

Of course, you can throw mutliple effects at it -- but it's the equivalent of mixing your metaphors. It's like a duck out of water, if you know what I'm saying.

Also: how does t-shirt art print with the transparency you're using? It doesn't if it's screenprinted. 

Can you take the base element of the logo (ie: one of the books) and build something out of that, in a modular fashion?</div>
