    that for a title?) on plate 12A."

    date: 7/1/1984\r\nNot expensive, at least in the US. currently about US$12 US.
    \r\nUPDATED sentences:\r\nCould be significant extra costs if you live outside
    the US. :(\r\nJust bought a used copy via Amazon from a local seller in my country,
    delivered to my home for the equivalent of US$12.  Sometimes being a font fan
    does not have to cost an arm and a leg. :)\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dick, has that ever stopped you from getting a font from a picture? :)\r\nJust
    because there are digital versions of Peter Schnorr's lettering, it does not mean
    that they are particularly well fonted. The digital versions I have seen of this
    font, perhaps all ripped from Sam Wang's first generation digital version, are
    less than impressive.\r\nAt the price, it's a good fishing expedition for info
    on other designs too.\r\nDon\r\n"
