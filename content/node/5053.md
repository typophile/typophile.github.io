body: Mr. OpenType &#40;aka Tom Phiney&#41; and his lovely wife Veronica welcomed
  a beautiful little girl into the world last night. Miranda Elizabeth made her entrance
  at about 9:20 pm. I&#39;ve seen pix, she&#39;s gorgeous! <BR> <BR>Congratulations
  on a fresh new type baby! I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be playing with ligatures in no
  time.

    from the hospital yesterday evening. Everybody is doing well. <BR> <BR>I have
    made the happy discovery that it&#39;s possible to cuddle your baby and do email
    at the same time, as long as you have a sling or similar baby carrying device,
    and are a good touch typist.
