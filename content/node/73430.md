body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of topics about hinting on typophile,
  but I couldn't find an answer to this.\r\nI have done manual hinting for my typeface
  (expletus), but when I generate an Opentype PS font the hinting doesn't seem to
  have any effect. If I generate an Win TrueType/Opentype TT font it does work. \r\n\r\nThis
  may sound a bit weird so to clarify: When genrating a font in TypeTool it gives
  me five options. These are: Win TrueType/Opentype TT, Opentype PS, Windows Type
  1, ASCII/UNIX Type 1, Fontlab. To be honest I don't really get all these options,
  but untill now opentype ps always worked fine for me.\r\n\r\nDoes Opentype PS simply
  not support hinting or does it need a different kind of hinting or am I doing something
  else wrong?\r\n\r\nsample 2 is with the Opentype PS font, so without functioning
  hinting.\r\nsample 3 is with the Win TrueType/Opentype TT font, so with functioning
  hinting.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard"

    though."

    than sample 3. BTW: This whole thread is only about the regular (lightest) weight.
    The other 2 weights are both unhinted.'

  body: "The differences you got are from screen tests with Acrobat/Reader or from
    prints?\r\n\r\nI also got generally better on screen results with non-hinted versions.
    But non-hinted complex glyphs, like ampersand or section mark, sometimes render
    horribly \u2013while the hinted version keeps a reasonable (although suboptimal)
    result.\r\n\r\nWith print tests, hinted fonts are definitively better, especially
    at sizes smaller than 14pt. PS hinting excels for printing but achieves limited
    results on screen. If your font is designed mainly for screen usage, TT hinting
    is a better choice.\r\n\r\nI compared your PDF files on screen (Windows Vista,
    Acrobat 9). At 50%, the non-hinted reads better. At 100% the only noticeable difference
    is a pixel up/down in H bar, with very subtle changes in curves \u2013but both
    reads well. At 150% they are rigorously equal, except for g \u2013but, again,
    both are good.\r\n\r\nProper alignment zones (this is, zones which coincides with
    main stems/curves of your glyphs) helps to get better on screen result. But I
    don't know if this feature is available in TypeTool (I use FontLab)."

  body: The differences are in Acrobat Reader. I thought hinting in general was mainly
    for use on screen. It appears I was wrong. Does PS hinting work the same way as
    TT hinting? I didn't know there was a difference. I'll have a look in the TypeTool
    manual for Proper Alignment Zones and PS hinting. The difference you saw in the
    H bar shouldn't be there since I only did the lowercase regular letters. Thanks
    a lot for your help.

  body: "The TypeTool manual doesn't say anything about 'Proper alignment zones'.
    The only hinting in Typetool seems to be Type 1 hinting for (logically) Type 1
    fonts. Is this of any use when I don't make Type 1 font? Type 1 seems to have
    gotten out of use. Furthermore it says that hints for True-Type fonts are always
    genrated automatcally. huh?! Does this also count for opentype ps? Does this mean
    I should forget about hinting? It doesn't say anything about opentype ps hinting.
    \r\n\r\nI'M CONFUSED!"

  body: "Both PS and TT hinting acts on screen and on printing. PS is simpler and
    focused on printing. TT is far more complex and targets screen results.\r\n\r\nOpenType
    format could be generated in two \"flavors\", OpenType PS (also called OT CFF)
    or OpenType TT. Both are mainly equal, the hinting system is their main difference.\r\n\r\nYou
    must use the hinting system according to the kind of OT file you plan to generate.
    Please note you also must set you UPM size differently to one or other format
    (PS default is 1000 UPM while TT default is 2048).\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of
    OpenType fonts are OT PS. One of the few exceptions is Vesper Pro.\r\n\r\nSuggestion:
    does not forget about hinting. Set hints manually as you're already doing and
    rely on print tests more than screen ones. Keep going with OT PS and put your
    focus on producing a good and consistent design. In the future, you can use this
    PS font to produce an OT TT for screen/web use if this is necessary."
