  body: <i>Is anybody making new font weights using python scripts for in Font Lab?
    </i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll sometimes do this to rough out a weight. Generally, I&#39;ll
    start with a single weight, use Python to extrapolate bold and light versions,
    and then make these axis extremes for a Multiple Master font. The results are
    pretty messy, and not useable for final fonts, but the MM font is useful for guaging
    basic stems and trying different weights.

  body: 'John, That helps alot - I had a feeling that there might be a way to steamline
    the process of looking &amp; comparing the possibilities - even if it doesn&#39;t
    give finnished results.  <BR> <BR>Do you have any suggestions for sources of python
    scripts? <BR> <BR>An aside about MM fonts: I think that MM instances are generated
    using a linear process. When you make a MM font you have to decide as the maker
    where the 50% mark is &amp; if you will have additional defined midpoints &amp;
    if so, where they are  - which lets you establish a sort of curve. Not a true
    curve but something more like one.  <BR> <BR>As a user of MM font you have to
    generate a font &amp; decide what values it will have and if the maker has only
    two extremes &amp; no strategically placed midpoints built in to cause sort of
    psudo curve then you might think a 75% value is going look like 75% - which it
    isn&#39;t. Linear scaling does not equal optical scaling. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll talk
    more about that in another posting because I see MM as &#40;maybe&#41; flawed
    when it comes to generating weights in a purely theoretical sense both with &amp;
    without midpoints because it is a linear process. <BR> <BR>There is more to this
    but I am going to hold off for now. MM per se is really a side issue &amp; not
    too important in a practical sense at this point.  <BR> <BR>James, Sorry if I
    came off as snotty. I didn&#39;t mean to be. I just thought your answer was incomplete.
    I see now that theory isn&#39;t your thing. Fair enough. I don&#39;t &#39;trust&#39;
    theories either. I don&#39;t reject them out of hand either. Dogma is a bad thing
    because it closes your eyes to your own authentic aethetic perception. Dogam about
    rejecting all theories is equally dubious in my opinion. <BR> <BR>Am I seeking
    a way out of &#42;all&#42; the labour? No.  <BR> <BR>Some of it? - Definitely.  <BR>
    <BR>If I dig a ditch I might choose a shovel rather than a spoon. Does that make
    me less nobel or my ditch less good because it took me 3 hours vs. 6 days to dig
    my ditch?  <BR> <BR>I want to avoid the drudgery that computers are good at so
    I can do what I hope am good at - looking &amp; judging.  <BR> <BR>In the end
    I think you are right that the eye has the be the final arbiter. I am admittedly
    new to this. I see that you are not. &#40;Nice stuff BTW&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I also
    see how doing most things yourself by hand &amp; not leaving it to machines is
    the only way to make really solid wothewhile stuff in nearly every case - even
    when making something like a handwriting font from scans.  <BR> <BR>On the other
    hand if I can look at lots of sets of weights made with different equations &#40;&amp;
    therefore different weight curves&#41; then I imagine I can do a better job of
    making multiple weights - particularly if there are lots &amp; lots of weights.
    <BR> <BR>Quite apart from whether you want math in your font process - you could
    talk about which model of weights looks better to you; Porchez, DeGroot, someone
    else, or maybe your own weight system. And you could talk about why you think
    that. You could talk about how you decided to make the weights you made for Alfon.  <BR>
    <BR>You could talk about really skinny or fat fonts &amp; why you don&#39;t make
    them - or haven&#39;t so far from what I can see on your web site. <BR> <BR>This
    kind of info could be seen as a trade secret too I suppose... <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    <BR> <BR>Do you work in multiple weights much or are you concerned with middle/normal
    weight forms for the most part?  <BR> <BR>All, sorry this entry is so long winded.
    When I post some examples &amp; test images with the formulas behind them I am
    sure they will clarify what I am after &amp; why better than my typing here has

  body: 'What I have done so far to make sense of this issue is to take the sample
    I found on the De Groot page &#40;See above with the arrows&#41; &amp; measure
    the density of pixels that compose the arrow&#39;s horizontal lines. A black pixel
    is 100 units &amp; grey one might be worth between 1 &amp; 99 units. Two black
    pixels measure as &#39;200&#39;. <BR> <BR>When I had estimated relative widths
    I looked for a rule or equation that could describe &amp; predict the changes
    that I saw from the thinest to the thickest.  <BR> <BR>The rule that seemed to
    be used for weight increase was: take 1&#43;1/3 of the weight of a charcter add
    it to get the target weight of the next charcter. In excel the formula is =Cx/3&#43;Cx
    where C is the column &amp; x is the number of the starting weight.  <BR> <BR>In
    this way 21 is converted to 28 &amp; so on. Not all number convert cleanly like
    this. For instance 28 becomes 37.33333... <BR> <BR>Because points in FontLab or
    Fontographer do not come in fractionally numbered positions some rounding must
    be done and an ideal curve/formula would therefore: <BR> <BR>- Provide a pleasing
    optical &#39;one step&#39; increase. <BR> <BR>- Provide numbers that either were
    either whole or were as close to a whole number as possible eg 1.1 &#40;1&#41;is
    better than 1.4 &amp; 1.9 &#40;2&#41; is better than 1.5. <BR> <BR>- Provide a
    whole pixel em unit number at 9 or 12 points or whatever screen size you might
    be targeting. For the font I am working on now &#40; monoline &#41; that would
    be 100 em units for a target of 9 pixels on screen. This last point is irrelevant
    if you are making a font with no focus on screen rendering such as a display face.
    <BR> <BR>The em units I calculated using my hypothetically &#39;De Groot style&#39;
    curve &amp; 1 as a base with every 2nd number sampled starting with 1 are <BR>
    <BR>1,2,3,6,10,18,32,56,100,177,315 <BR> <BR>These are also the rounded or clean
    numbers. The unrounded mathematical result is: <BR> <BR>1 <BR>1.333333333 <BR>1.777777778
    <BR>2.37037037 <BR>3.160493827 <BR>4.21399177 <BR>5.618655693 <BR>7.491540924

    numbers match the Thesis fonts exactly either in terms of their actual ratios
    to each other. If I have sussed the formula he used that would be interesting
    especially since it yeilds mostly nice #s. I like the fact that it yields a 10
    &amp; a 100 for instance. <BR> <BR>Here is what the rule/formula looks like as
    a curve charted in excel: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/24914.gif"

    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/24915.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>My
    reaction to this curve is that it emphasizes the light &amp; dark too much in
    10 steps. A flatter curve would be better. The steps do feel even though - that
    much is good. A smaller fraction than 1&#43;1/3rd might give better results. It
    would be nice to sample every number too. It might be better to start with 2 or
    3 or even 5 rather than 1. These are the ideas I will be testing next. <BR> <BR>It
    seems like a golden mean ratio could be tried too. I have to look into it. <BR>
    <BR>If I owned thesis I could measure it directly - but I don&#39;t. As you can
    see it wasn&#39;t really crucial to know what he did exactly to be able to start
    experimenting. I am not sure I like his formula so well that I would want to use
    it in any case. I mean I really like &amp; respect his stuff, but Porchez may
    have something in that crit.   <BR> <BR>Also I&#39;d rather work out my own rationale.
    It more fun, it&#39;s valid intellectual property &#40; if I was keeping it to
    myself &#41; and maybe it&#39;s even a noble kind of labour or something like
    that. <BR> <BR>BTW : DeGroot actually provides three equations on his site but
    I have not been able to make anything out of it so far. If anbody else can explain
    them please let me know! <BR> <BR>I will do some additional experiments and post
    them if folks are interested - especially if I make something I like.  <BR> <BR>I
    could also post the my excel sheet somewhere if it could help anybody work out
    formulas/weight curves they like. <BR> <BR>Does my original question make better
    sense now? Am I just nuts?  <BR> <BR>Do you think a split curve would make better
    sense or give better results? eg: One curve for the bolds &amp; one for the ligher
    weights with a normal weight in the middle. If you think so, why? <BR> <BR>Thanks!'

    Porchez, thanks for looking in!  <BR> <BR>I hope you have time to look closer
    at my arguement later. If you have anything else to say I would love to hear it
    - especially anything theoretical in nature, even it turns out that you, like
    James, reject outright using any sort of theory or math to design fonts. <BR>
    <BR>Actually, I think I can prove my basic point about curves in general if only
    because DeGroot clearly used a formula to make some &#42;really&#42; nice fonts
    &amp; clearly didn&#39;t use some sort of crude global process as James assumed
    I was inquiring about.  <BR> <BR>Maybe, if I am fortunate, I can find a better
    curve than De Groot did &amp; show how an improved curve can work to make something
    really nice &amp; really functional.  <BR> <BR>Actually, I think finding a better
    curve will probably be easy.  Applying that curve in a sensitive, inteligent &amp;
    inspired manner will probably be much, much harder. <BR> <BR>Using a formula for
    a major element such as acenders will probably be straightforeward. A modified
    set of formulas could probably be developed to handle many other aspects of develping
    a bold &#40; or light&#41; face. Maybe a different curve can or should be invented
    for altering each major aspect of a font. I don&#39;t know if I will do it - but
    that it is possible to do &amp; that some mathematical process&#39; can help a
    typographer&#39;s initial process&#39; both seem obvious to me now.  <BR> <BR>I
    still wonder which aspects of DeGroot&#39;s face were subject to his formula.
    Maybe all of them were -  in some way. Maybe he will enlighten us. Wouldn&#39;t
    that be excellent?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post to this thread if I find anything in
    my experiments that seems useful.  <BR> <BR>If anybody owns a license to a thesis
    series font &amp; can hypothesize about the weights work for different aspects
    of the fonts that would be fun to hear about!

    very bad eyes and can see well when fonts are very very small, thin, dark, curved
