  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have a big problem with type 1 fonts and OS X 10.3.x (Panther). These are fonts I use already for a long time. I had modified them with Fontographer (Euro glyph added for example; changed some glyphs a little). The Fontographer generated fonts already had this problems (only with Panther, nbot before) and I bought FontLab some weeks ago with the hope to solve this problem &hellip; but it doesn't work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OK - what happens? The fonts look ok on the screen, but when printing on any postscript printer (I tried several ones - original postscript level 2 printers, harlequin level 3 imagesetter RIP and so on) - kerning/spacing is quite wrong; usually the lines get longer (word spacing is increased and at the same time charakter spacing seems to be decreased. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even the same character pairs differ in different lines!!! Some are OK, some not (all &quot;wrong&quot; ones are wrong in the same way). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This happens with any software (I tried Freehand MX 11.02, Illustrator CS, InDesign CS, QuarkXPress 6.1 and so on), but only under Panther. With Jaguar, everything is OK!!! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And another strange thing: when making a PDF by distilling a PS-file with these fonts, everything is also OK and the PDF even prints correctly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The only thing I didn't try is if it also happens with non-former-Fontographer-fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And: the same font as TrueType also works, but looks horrible on screen, specially in small sizes (no TrueType hinting?). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I use now the TrueType version, but I would prefer the type 1 version because of the screen appearance. But I also want to know where this problem comes from - and I would like to be able to generate type 1 fonts which work also in Panther! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And I also tried a lot of different settings when generating the font from FontLab 4.6 - nothing helps. It is also not an issue of one Mac - I tried it on 3 different Macs - everywhere the same. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Has anyone an idea or is this a known problem with type 1 and panther? (I couldn't find a thread here with this probem.)</div>
