    on the topic of dashes floating around here. For example: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/27727">http://typophile.com/node/27727</a>.'

    at the accepted standard of editing style for whereever you live.

    might vary by client, as some clients may want you to stick with certain established
    styles. '

  body: "Thank u Jpad also..(I understand its very basic but I'm not from design background.
    And Not that i dont mind buying books on typography, or respect the designers
    here, however, someone suggested me for \"a vague\" suggestion here, anyone could
    have researched that info online but I wanted to know from the 'real designers
    point of view')\r\n\r\ndavid hamuel: if you dont have any specific idea, then
    say so, dont be mr. 'ego' \"read&buy this&that'"

  body: "Typopo - I don't think you're being fair to David. You're new here and asking
    a lot of extremely basic questions (which seems epidemic these days) some of which
    are either repetitive (to us) or - no offense - not very interesting. While most
    people here are happy to help, you will find the info you need regarding type
    styles in a book like Bringhurst. It's a worthy investment.\r\n\r\nYou will also
    find - if you read the thread Jason suggested - that there isn't always a lot
    of consensus in the design community about even such basic matters as em and en
    dash usage."

  body: "Patty's right, Typopo. David was simply giving you the names of some really
    good manuals which, as Patty says, are worth the investment. You could also try
    to see if these books are at your local library, if you can't buy any books right
    now.\r\n\r\nMay I also suggest <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em>? There is
    a section on punctuation which covers dashes. But as stated above, there is not
    always consensus on these matters, so no one manual may have the \"right\" answer.
    It is a good idea to check out more than one book."
