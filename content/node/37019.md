  body: Frutiger would work well with so many typefaces. Tell us more about the client
    and their audience to help us narrow it down.

  body: I'm not a designer or anything, and I'm the one writing the proposal.  I do
    web development work, some corporate, and some non-profit, and I'm looking for
    something that looks clean and modern, but not distracting.  This proposal, in
    particular, is for a web 2.0-ish application for a professional organization.  The
    proposal probably won't be read by more than three or four people (a mix of technical
    staff and non-technical stakeholders - lawyers, mostly), but I'd like to make
    a good impression.

  body: There is a lot of mileage in the Fruitiger family. Because it is a family
    with versions that provide the necessary contrast for heads and subheads. Stay
    with Frutiger if possible.

  body: Me thinks keep it simple and use a different width/weight of Frutiger; like
    if your body is condensed/light then go for extended/bold with a swatch compliment
    too...
