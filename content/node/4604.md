  body: Lynn <BR> <BR>Interesting period. Transition from letterpress to photofilm/offset.
    Certain to have an influence on typography, yes? <BR> <BR>So, historically, what
    were these two different countries up to at this period of time? <BR> <BR>The
    US was geared up after the war. Manufacturers flush with money, world resources
    open and under control without trade restrictions, future quite bright, and lots
    of junk to sell. Appropriation of typefaces for corporate propaganda... from European
    emigres whose faces were used to sell ideologies. <BR> <BR>What the hell was Britain
    doing? Rebuilding. Clinging proudly to its past hurrah and its heritage. Watching
    the US take center stage. Hiring the most prominent European emigre typographer
    to redesign books in the traditional manner. <BR> <BR>How do political, economical,
    social, cultural, technological events effect typography? A bit. And what I&#39;ve
    only touched on is the immediate postwar years. Bit of huge topic you have there.

  body: One suggestion might be to research the work of Ken Garland. He has a book,
    &#34;A Word In Your Eye&#34; that covers some of your time period. Perhaps you
    could also find use for Michael Twyman&#39;s book &#34;Printing 1770-1970&#34;.
    Both books have bibliographies, you could use those as well. Bibliographies are
    the researchers friend. <BR>

    good look too.

  body: 'Lynn <BR> <BR>There I go again. I&#39;m always assuming graphic designers
    have a knowledge of history. I&#39;ll take this as a serious question.  <BR> <BR>In
    the context of your proposal, the cessation of World War II and the beginning
    of the Cold War was in 1945. Reconstruction and rebuilding for the new era would
    easily extend a decade following. The two most significant cultural/social/economic/political
    etc events that would significantly alter the landscape after this were <BR> <BR>in
    the US: the election and assassination of Kennedy and the Vietnam War <BR> <BR>in
    Britain: the Beatles <BR> <BR>Technologically, significant occurances were the
    emergence of visual media and the growth in advertising and packaging design &#40;over
    previous concerns for the book&#41; and the complete switch over from letterpress
    to offset printing processes, from metal type to filmoffset.... <BR> <BR>Design
    styles would seem to pattern these sorts of changes. <BR> <BR>That will take you
    to 1975'
