body: Does anyone have any tips on creating TTF files for @font-face usage? I have
  a script going in fontforge to generate all the basic formats for online (ttf,eot,woff,svg)
  but my one issue is how to get the TTF into a protected format. I have seen people
  export the TTF before where you cannot just open it locally, or install it. I know
  its not 100% bullet proof, but I am just curious does anyone know how to do this,
  preferably in fontforge?

  body: The follow question for this, anyone know why webkit is now supporting WOFF
    format, but Safari still needs TTF? Chrome (built on webkit) works with woff format
    now, any ideas what is going on there?
