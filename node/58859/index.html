  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everybody!
I&rsquo;d like to get some criticism about a logo I&rsquo;m working on for a contest in my design school.</p>
<p>Cresco (in english it&rsquo;s GROW) is a project which deals with sustainable development. It helps companies to share their sustainable &lsquo;&lsquo;habits&rsquo;&rsquo; with citizens, and its main areas of activities are:
-energy saving
-recycling
-sustainable transport</p>
<p>As for my entry, I decided to approach the broader concept of &lsquo;&lsquo;sustainable development&rsquo;&rsquo; rather than focusing on one of the 3 areas (and hence leaving the other 2 out).
After some sketching I came out with this pictogram which symbolizes a human being &lsquo;&lsquo;growing&rsquo;&rsquo; from leaves (nature - the environment).
My choice of lowercase letters tries to make the logo more friendly, and I chose these fonts (avant garde and futura) because their kind of &lsquo;&lsquo;circle based&rsquo;&rsquo; and it connects them to the pyctogram, which is round.
Also, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;safe&rdquo; fonts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not happy with it though, what do you think?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My initial impressions; I couldn&rsquo;t tell that was a person in the background, a little too vague with just a circle on top of a box. Also, is there a reason for the green &ldquo;o&rdquo; at the end of &ldquo;cresco?&rdquo; Conceptually, is there a better symbol or group of symbols that will more effectively communicate these sustainable habits? I see soooo many leaves and the color green on all these eco-friendly, sustainable this-and-that logos that they all start to melt together. Green noise, if you will.</p>
<p>Again, just an initial impression, and I&rsquo;m very interested to see if anyone has ideas regarding alternative ways to communicate the whole &ldquo;green&rdquo; concept.</p>

<p>While I agree about the greenwashing/use of leaves is done to death, I&rsquo;m going to leave that.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ve got just isn&rsquo;t friendly in any way. Sustainability (in this capacity) is about people making a difference, changing the way they behave, consume and ultimately their impact on the environment.</p>
<p>The mark you currently has feels totally sterile and clinical.</p>
<p>Sure lowercase letters can (in general) give the impression of a more relaxed and casual organisation &hellip; but type choice still affects the response - so pay attention.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Recently I read that blue is the new green. And considering the Earth is mostly water there is a bit of sense to that. I do agree that the mark is sterile looking, I&rsquo;d like to see it morph into something more organic. To me the person and leaves don&rsquo;t necessarily say -energy saving -recycling -sustainable transport, they could just as easily represent a landscaper. I&rsquo;m with Paul get some paper and start sketching, and a good observation by Natalie, you may want to tweak the size of the &ldquo;o&rdquo;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks everybody for the suggestions :)
here are some sketches I made before and after posting here.
<img src="/images/old-images/sketches1_3823.jpg" alt=""> <img src="/images/old-images/sketches2_3979.jpg" alt="">
(No scanner, have to take pics with my 50mm, sorry]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding really hard to find an effective, and possibly &lsquo;&lsquo;unseen&rsquo;&rsquo; way to convey the idea of sustainable development .
As Coe said, there&rsquo;s a lot of &lsquo;&lsquo;green noise&rsquo;&rsquo; around, and searching in books and on the internet for inspiration isn&rsquo;t really helpful, it just makes you think that EVERYTHING has been already thought of. Are there really so many green companies out there? :D</p>
<p>The concept of my icon isn&rsquo;t groundbreaking, but I can&rsquo;t focus just in one of the areas of the project (energy/transport/recycling). the job would be easier if I could concentrate in only one of them, but I would leave the other 2 out.</p>
<p>Anyway I tried to fix it to make it look more like a person
See here: <a href="http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/6852/picture3qea.jpg">http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/6852/picture3qea.jpg</a></p>
<p>Would you suggest to walk away from it and pursue some other idea from the sketches?
Maybe something more typographic as a green O / O as a leave&hellip; etc?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it might be worthwhile to try approaching this one from a different angle. For a less corporate, more natural feel, consider doing something less geometric/rigid. Take a look at the Legacy Timber logo on [[http://www.atomic74.com/work/corporate-identity|Tungsten&rsquo;s]] portfolio. I think there is potential in exploring this type of stylistic route.</div>

<p>…apart from that though: I think it&rsquo;s quite interesting graphically,
but I get a different &ldquo;motion&rdquo; impression from it than &ldquo;growing&rdquo; –
it seems to be rotating clockwise in a vortex kind of way.

I don&rsquo;t think the resemblance is a problem - since they have extremely different targets and deal with different matters :)</p>
<p>I know it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s growing from the leaves, but also I don&rsquo;t think that it HAS to look like it is.
That was my first idea, but then playing around with other sketches I came out with this, which shows man and nature as different beings, and also as a whole - a visual metaphore for sustainable development.</p>
<p>Makes sense?</p>

Although I recognize that both the leaves and the type might benefit with some tweaking, so, just for design&rsquo;s sake, HOW would you have achieved a more organic look with the leaves, and what font(s) would you have used for the text? :-)</p>
<p>Oh, about the e with arrows&hellip; it&rsquo;s a concept i didn&rsquo;t develop because that was something I saw between the sketches of a classmates of mine for another green logo (this time a school assignment) and I would have felt like an idea-thief ;)</p>

My logo was awarded the first prize in the school competition, and is currently used by the Cresco no profit organization.
I would like to thanks all the users which contributed in making my design progress with their criticism.</p>
<p>This is how it looks like at the end, after a direct confrontation with the client.
• <a href="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/7505/picture3q.jpg">http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/7505/picture3q.jpg</a>
Do you think the type got (at least a little bit) better?</p>
<p>Also, I would like to hear some suggestions about another version of the logo they asked me to design for them.
The text they require is &ldquo;isola cresco&rdquo; (cresco island) and it&rsquo;s like a &lsquo;&lsquo;medal&rsquo;&rsquo; they would give to cities which are parts of the project.
They want to retain the same graphic symbol but they were thinking of having the text running around in a circle.
I don&rsquo;t think it would work, but I dont think either that having the same symbol and a different text would work. 
I fear it would only create confusion with the main logo, especially because on its first period.
What do you think?</p>
