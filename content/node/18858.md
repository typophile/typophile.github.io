  body: "You're quite right Yves. That's exactly what was on my mind.\r\n\r\nI didn't
    know Saturday Sans existed until I saw a brochure yesterday using it for headlines.
    Just goes to show - there's nothing new under the sun.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Do you have any idea which one was created first? Not that it really matters,
    as both faces are clearly different -- just being curious.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I prefer Chevin as it looks more sophisticated, with much better balanced characters
    and a more pronounced character/identity. Also, I have the impression that there's
    quite a bit of <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?query=officina+sans&pid=204974&page_id=9270&grab_id=0&SCOPE=Fonts\">ITC
    Officina Sans</a> in <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=405975\">Saturday
    Sans</a>.\r\n\r\nHmmm, actually, it's more than quite a bit, and far too much
    for my taste. Anybody know who designed this?"

  body: On fonts.com it says the foundry is Image Club, which became Eyewire, then
    was bought by Adobe, and eventually shut down. When Eyewire folded some of the
    veterans left and started Veer. Maybe some of the Veer guys around here could
    tell you more...

  body: I wouldn't go <em>that</em> far. There are some original goodies in there.
    But it is hit and miss.

  body: I really don't think they had actual clones, it was more like thinking "Hmmm,
    this one looks vaguely familiar" every now and then. They had some good stuff
    as well.
