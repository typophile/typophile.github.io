body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_3572.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe text in the image
  is from an album cover dated 1969. I'm quite sure that this is an actual font and
  not a custom job because I've seen the same lettering on other sleeves from the
  late '60s and early '70s. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!"

  body: I do believe that's it. The resolution on the sample image I provided isn't
    the best, so the halftone pattern got a bit washed out. Mark this one solved.
    Thanks!!
