  deals with 3D design for architecture. Therefore the logo has to work for a design
  company AND a 3D/architecture company. So, I'm looking for any relationships between
  type and architecture. Anything will do: books, designers, movements web links etc.
  Anything to help me connect the two.\r\nCheers!"

  body: From reading <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Meggs-History-Graphic-Design-Philip/dp/0471699020/ref=sr_1_1/102-7686315-2079332?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1184632072&sr=8-1><em>Meggs'
    History of Graphic Design</em></a>, I recall that the De Stijl and Bauhaus movements/schools
    were concerned with design in all forms, from architecture to interior to graphic
    (and both innovated letterforms as well). Frank Lloyd Wright also did a good amount
    of graphic design, including desinging some typefaces (available from P22 <a href=http://www.p22.com/products/flwfa.html>here</a>
    (look in the left column for the "FLLW" fonts). Any of those could make a good
    starting point, although all three have very distinctive styles that you may not
    (or may) want to embrace. I'm partial to De Stijl's asymmetrical balance myself.

  body: "\"Roman\" inscriptional capitals in their original context, carved into architraves,
    walls and tympanae of buildings erected by the ancient Romans during classical
    antiquity, were explicity architectural in their construction.\r\n\r\nThe relationship
    to classical architecture goes beyond setting. The basic elements of circle, square,
    half-square, triangle and post (stem) making up roman inscriptional capitals occur
    as similar elements in Roman classical architecture, inhereted from the Greeks
    and elaborated upon by the Romans. Numerous theories have surfaced on the origin
    of serifs; regardless of their true origin(s), the resemblance of bracketed and
    wedge-shaped serifs on inscriptional capitals to the wedge-profile of the echinus
    element of doric columns probably helped secure their position in the grammar
    of classical lettering style.\r\n\r\nGoudy's Trajan typeface and the Trajan Inscription
    in Rome are the best-known examples, but there are of course many others.\r\n\r\nThe
    later dual case \"roman\" typefaces of Francesco Griffo and Nicolas Jenson emulated
    the style of Roman inscriptional capitals, yet their lower cases were specifically
    typographic creations of the Renaissance, owing more to their origins as calligraphic
    letters, which borrowed a bit of stylistic detail from Roman inscriptional capitals.
    \r\n\r\nThat's all very well for classical architecture and classical capitals---if
    your client fits that shoe. Contemporary architecture (I won't call it \"modern\")
    demands contemporary type, faces that retain the basic structural components but
    shed classical detail. \r\n\r\nA clean set of capitals like those of Neutraface
    or Futura.\r\n\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    to bring your attention to the hieroglyphs of mesoamericans, such as the words
    and syllables of the Mayan... http://research.famsi.org/mdp/mdp_index.php  \r\n\r\nAnd
    when their writting was carved of huge blocks of building stone, they became very
    3d, which is quite a different method of communicating a written language (organically
    speaking of architecture) from the greeks and the romans (and their decendants
    too). With the mesoamericans, the medium was the message(?)\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yaxchilan-Lintel-24_4201.jpg]\r\nFor
