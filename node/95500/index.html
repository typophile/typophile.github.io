  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I was meaning to post this in late May / early June, but it&rsquo;s been a crazy summer. I graduated from the University of the Arts in May, and since then I&rsquo;ve adjusted to my first full-time design job while taking some time to enjoy the little things in life.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I was fortunate enough to take Font Design Lab under the brilliant Mike Abbink last semester. I developed a Humanist sans serif titled Agio, and I&rsquo;d be interested in any feedback or criticism that you wise Typophiles are able to impart. I&rsquo;m not sure where to go from here&hellip;keep tweaking? Develop a bold weight? Discover the maddening thrill of kerning tables? I&rsquo;d like to start on a new weight, but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s room for improvement before I go ahead.</p>
<p>Attached is what I presented at my final critique. If anyone needs to see more to make a fair judgment, let me know!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ll cut right to the chase: exactly who will go out of his way to use this design? Formally it&rsquo;s a nice balance between grot and humanist sans styles (two highly ubiquitous genres) but even that&rsquo;s not exactly rare these days. So making this could be a great learning experience -and maybe that was your plan- but how much further could it really go?</p>
<p>It might be telling that you&rsquo;ve been Abbink&rsquo;s student - I&rsquo;m seeing the sort of genericity that Kievit exhibits. I for one admire a good deal of Abbink&rsquo;s work (not least NBC Universal) but even somebody who admires Kievit has to realize it came out over a decade ago (and in fact was started almost two decades ago).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to recommend - certainly slapping on a gimmick to differentiate it is a bad idea. I would suggest thinking deeply about how to make this more you. Formal education is a two-edged sword, and the better your teacher the harder it is to make your own mark&hellip; Good luck!</p>

What he said. It is good work what you've done on Agio, but take the chance to express yourself through this design before moving on.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is not nearly humanist. Modernsit sans with a few humanist qualities at best. I like it, but it reminds me of something (don&rsquo;t know what) which is usually not a very good sign&hellip; The above two comments could be right. Cheers! jasper</div>
