  body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nI'm a huge fan of Mr. Kobayashi's work especially for his
    take on the informational Frutiger/Myriad genre- Axis. However, it would be advantageous
    for the foundry to offer a 'latin only' Axis package for the designers that do
    not use the Japanese language. This would also bring the prices down from their
    stratospheric heights us humans can afford.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"
