<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello everyone, I'm designing a calendar for the year 2005. Instead of having a traditional saints' feast days, like those that can be seen on church calendars, I'd like to try having a "patron typographer," or something like that, for each day. Some of these typogragraphers/type designers would have further details/descriptions/portraits/work samples/etc., and some would only have their names listed. <br> <br>So, who has a "patron saint," whose spirit they try to channel for inspiration? <br> <br>Conversely, does anyone have "typographic demon," whose presence occasionally needs to be exorcised from your work? <br> <br>Dan</div>

<div class=commentbody>I can't believe I'm about to defend Gill.... <br> <br>I just wanted to point out that Johnston's Underground typeface started out as a collaboration between Gill and Johnston. Gill actually got paid some substantial fee for his contribution. But he dropped out before the project was finished. <br> <br>So Johnston Underground had substantial input from Gill, and therefore accusing Gill of "ripping it off" seems pretty goofy to me. <br> <br>That being said, I still have a lot of questions about his personal life that would lead me to think twice about considering him a typographic saint. I mean, I have nothing against free love in general, but I'm not sure one's practice of it should extend to one's family pets and one's own children. <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Apparently, the Pope is leaning towards declaring St Isidore of Seville (7th century) the patron saint of the Internet, following the lead of Spanish catholics in 1999 who declared him Protector of the Internet. He produced the first encyclopaedia, among other things. <br> <br><a href=http://www.news24.com/News24/Technology/News/0%2C target=_blank>2-13-1443_1355345%2C00.html,http://www.news24.com/News24/Technology/News/0,,2-13-1443_1355345,00.html</a> <br> <br>"All spiritual growth comes from reading and reflection. By reading we learn what we did not know; by reflection we retain what we have learned.

<div class=commentbody>Cool. Pretty long list though, eh? <br> <br>GGL is not only alive, he came out of retirement recently! <br> <br>You can't really exclude Kis if you're going to include Janson. <br> <br>And if you're going to include Louis XIV, you'll have to throw in the entire RdR gang: Anisson, Jaugeon, Simonneau, etc. <br> <br>And then there's Deberny (since you're including Peignot). <br> <br>Lastly, it's nice to see Morison excluded, but then you do have Pierpont. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I was pretty shocked to see G&uuml;nther Gerard Lange <br>on your list, Dan... <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> He's not dead indeed! Talking <br>about the length of the list, it seems a tad unwieldy. <br>It looks like you didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. <br>What's the point of making a list if you're going to <br>include pretty everyone? <br> <br>And I <i>REALLY</i> feel the allusions to Gill's private life <br>have no merit whatsoever in the making of this list.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, a year does have 365 days! Just like the Catholic Church's calendar of saints (if that's what it is really called?) My calendar will have saints days on many days (like a third of them, so far). My list may not be long enough! Some saints are paired up on church calendars, too, making the list even longer. <br> <br>What I don't want to make is something like Pentagram's 2004 calendar. They got 12 designers (living and dead) picked. Each month has the days set in a different typeface. In addition to holidays, the 12 type designers birthdays are listed. That is a neat promo piece, but I'm not going to learn anything new from it. I'd like my calendar to be a bit more encyclopedic. <br> <br>Since we are on the subject of religion, let me issue a public mea culpa here for including GGL on my list! <br> <br>Since this will be my calendar, the list sort of follows my interests. I don't think that I could hurt my own feelings You'll notice that there are several "Offenbachers" on the list (Klingspors, Koch, Hoefer), since I'm studying there now, and am naturally interested on what happend there in the past. <br> <br>I'm going to have to stay steadfast with Gill, though. His work has inspired me for years. Although he most certaintly was, in some regards, a shady character, we are only speaking about allegations here. He has been dead since 1940, and rumors have a funny way of spreading. If you give me definitive legal evidence that he molested children, or engaged in rampant beastiality, I'll take him off my list. Ok?</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Well, a year does have 365 days! <br> <br>Oh, I forgot about the calendar angle. Makes sense now. <br> <br>> If you give me definitive legal evidence .... <br> <br>Although we can (but probably shouldn't...) define what "molesting children" or "rampant bestiality" mean exactly, it's pretty well admitted that he did engage in some (mild?) forms of those - the evidence is mostly in his own diaries! The "child" was his daughter, but it's not clear to me what a good minimum age is for a consenting adult. The dog on the other hand was probably too down-to-earth to have consented, but a dog is a dog; you should see what "respectable" people do to cows in preparing hamburger patties... And the good news for Gill is that he wasn't <i>unflinching</i> about it - he does seem to have had an internal struggle and remorse. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I was the one who brought it up, and it was basically a reaction to the phrase "patron saint," which I think can be reasonably believed to imply that someone is of good character (whatever the heck that is). <br> <br>Although many of us keep our professional and private lives separate, Gill didn't very much at all. I mean, some of his students who studied under Gill, really *studied under* Gill, if you get my drift. <br> <br>If we'd been asked whose work we found most inspirational and admired most, I'd have had absolutely no qualms about seeing Gill on the list. <br> <br>Dan may very well have meant "patron saint" to mean no more than that, of course. But I don't think I'm out of line in thinking that its more literal meaning can be seen as flavoring the concept a little. <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think you should't look at it from such a Christian angle. Sure, that's the association "Saint" usually has, but then what about the title of Cabarga's book: "Logo, Font and Lettering Bible"? <br> <br>And what about Griffo? He was hanged for the murder of his son-in-law. And Goudy was a certifiable skirt-chaser. And Koch was a woman-hater. And Beatrice Warde was a husband-swapper who caused Frederic to hang himself*. And hey, don't let me start on friggin' Louis XIV!! Gill simply made the mistake of keeping a diary. <br> <br>* Speaking of which, Dan, you really need to add Cassandre. Even though he hung himself because a font house rejected his designs - what a lousy Catholic, eh? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
