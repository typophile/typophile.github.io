  Script.\r\n\r\nIn this snippet image, you see two ways the script typeface will
  be used on this website. I would love for those more knowledgeable in typeface-pairing
  to make some suggestions. I am quite lost when it comes to script/brush fonts, even
  moreso with pairing them.\r\n\r\nSome more info: This is for a website design. The
  sans-serif typeface \"Avante Garde Gothic\" is not changeable.\r\n\r\nThank you
  for your time and input."

    whether you like Avant Garde Gothic or not, please be professional and spell it
