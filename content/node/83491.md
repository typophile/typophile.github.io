  fonts(woodtyperevival.com). We have an Arts & Crafts face that we are currently
  working on and I was wondering if anyone could help me identify this glyph (in red
  box, could be upside down)? I have included other characters for reference. \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AC_glyph_6016.jpg]"

  body: If upside down, could be either an alternate ampersand or the number eight...

  body: "Thanks for your feedback. Here is the full font proof that we printed. I
    don't think its an alternate 8 because all the figures are pretty uniform but
    an alternate ampersand maybe. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_lno3gbN8ig1qkqpa0o1_1280_5366.jpg]"

    it's from? Looks a little Art Nouveau-y!

    not upside-down. Z, on the other hand, appears to be upside-down)"

    as S.

  body: "Thanks all. Unfortunately we don't have much background on the font. It's
    from England and probably dates to around late 1800's/early 1900's. We are working
    with other wood type gurus to try and identify it. \r\n\r\nriccard0 - You are
    correct, don't know how I didn't notice that. Thanks! "

    face.\r\nCan we see some sample words/numbers, with \"S\", \"&\" and \"8\"?"

    based on a design like this one:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/and_4067.png]"

  body: "Seeing it as it is, it did not make sense as an ampersand, so I thought it
    would have to be turned upside down.\r\n\r\nBut when I actually look at it upside
    down, it looks like an 8 or an S, even though it would not be consistent with
    the typeface as an alternate form of either, and not at all like an ampersand.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AC_both_5104.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
    at this point, I'm very unsure that there is an answer. Perhaps it's merely a
    decorative flourish, and not a symbol at all."

  body: Thanks again everyone for your suggestions. I agree that its not an 8 or S
    and probably not an &. Also flipping it horizontally would not be conventional
    in wood type. Originally I was wondering if it was a glyph I did not know about
    but maybe it's from another font and just got misplaced with this one.

  body: "This is a variant ampersand. I've seen this form before, and if you look
    at the construction you'll see that it follows the most common & form, only with
    the leg curled back to re-join the abbreviated lower left loop: this is a quickly
    written form, made with a single movement starting in the lower middle and moving
    up to the right.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, during the type crit session at TypeCon
    on Sunday, Matthew Carter advised against a kind of swash numeral 8 that a designer
    had made on the grounds that it could easily be confused with this form of ampersand."
