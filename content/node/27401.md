  image:\r\nhttp://images.ffonline.it/img/data/media/9/final_fantasy_vii_7_screenshot_22.jpg\r\n\r\nWhere
  it says: \"Dovreste andarvene tutti da qui, verso luoghi come le Isole di Mideel
  a sud.\"\r\n\r\nI realize this may be difficult because there are several fonts
  that are like this but I figured it was worth a shot.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot"

    would I make it look '8 bit' in photoshop..it still doesn't look right when I
    set the anti-aliasing methold to none. How would I make it look like a pixel font..hmmm.."

  body: A method that I just came up with (and may be quite roundabout) is to make
    the text awfully pitifully small in Photoshop with AA turned off and then zoom
    right in, select the outlines, fill it, trim the canvas, resize the image with
    "Nearest Neighbour" to the size that you need and there you go.

  body: "Disclaimer: this is just my own half-baked theory. I think most console games
    - even the newest ones - use their own custom purely-bitmap fonts. From a programming
    standpoint it would be madness to include vector data when the output is going
    to be a fixed size and will for all intents and purposes be displayed only on
    screen.\r\n\r\nRetorik's idea will work. For bonus clarity, when you resize the
    tiny type, size it proportionally by multiples of 100%; that way each tiny pixel
    becomes a perfect square in the larger size.\r\n\r\nIf you need to set a whole
    lot of text like this, you could try a font out there like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/scr-i/\">SCR</a>
    or some such."

  body: ">Disclaimer: this is just my own half-baked theory. \r\n\r\nBut it's mostly
    correct. The XBox 360 for example supports unhinted TrueType fonts, but as these
    need to be redrawn n-times a second few processes use them due to the performance
    hit. The Xbox dashboard being an exception. \r\n\r\nSo what games creators do
    is run a font through a utility and create a derivative bitmap font containing
    characters at a set size - these are then texture mapped onto surfaces, such as
    the game UI or other elements. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"

    font is an exact match (but is missing the complete character set)."
