  cover throughout its history and would appreciate any help you folks can offer.
  \r\nThe first one was introduced in 1947 and has remained constant since. It looks
  like Akzidenz Grotesk bold condensed to me, but I'm certainly no expert. The image
  is from 1950.\r\n\r\nThe second is from earlier, from 1944.\r\n\r\nThe third is
  from earlier still, from 1933. In that one, I'm paricularly interested in the typeface
  used for the subtitle, Arte nella casa.\r\n\r\nThese may well be easy identifications
  for you, but I'm giving a talk about cover design of architectural periodicals,
  and want to avoid slipping up on this particular element of it!\r\n\r\nmany thanks-Linda\r\n"

  body: I'm not sure, but since Domus is an Italian magazine I wouldn't be surpriced
    if Mr Novarese had a finger in this. Especially the period mentioned.

    body: "Stefan and Yves -\r\n\r\nThanks, yes, I wondered about the Novarese/Nebiolo
      possibilities, but could find nothing that corresponded exactly, or that even
      corresponded with the dates. I'm prepared to go with Yves' suggestion that the
      logos were custom designed. There was a stretch of Domus in the very late 30s
      and early 40s when the logo changed with nearly each issue, and was very much
      \"handmade\" or even \"handcrafted\". Yet the editor of the magazine remained
      constant. I am wondering what contributed to the radical changes\u2014fashion,
      yes, but there must be more to it."

    ask you to have a look at this if you have a minute:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/28096\r\nI've
    posted this ages ago but nobody was able to comment on that (probably the first
    time it happens in Typophile's history), maybe you know something about? Thank
    you so much in advance."

    I am not sure if he was dealing with the design of the covers. I asked a colleague
    in Italy so I might be able to tell you something later."

    has been undertaken by the <em>Istituto per la Storia della Resistenza del Piemonte</em>
    and it\u2019s far from being classified. I hope your speech went great."
