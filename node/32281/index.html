  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>To start, i&rsquo;m new to the site and i think i just found hours worth of reading material..good stuff ;)</p>
<p>Now on to the beginning logo sketches;
Client is a company describes themselves as a design,marketing and advertising company.  It&rsquo;s a local startup with hopes of attracting small to mid-size business with a decent budget for advertising. In short, between mom and pop shops and big corporate.</p>
<p>-some (rather philosophical) guidelines they gave:
-The name they have is Dynamis Media
-definition: strength, ability, power, &ldquo;inherent power, power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature, or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth&rdquo; 
-Red is a power color
-Red was crucial to alchemy. Preliminary stage to the &ldquo;Philosophers Stone&rdquo; - a magic substance which was capable of converting cheap metals into gold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the beginning stages of sketching and concepts&hellip;.some help would be greatly appreciated :)  Attached are a few I picked, leaning towards the first and last ones. your thoughts?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you might need to start again - the typeface itself doesn&rsquo;t feel powerful to me.</p>
<p>One final thought on the Philosophers Stone - true alchemists understood that this was a metaphor and that what they were really trying to do is convert themselves to &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. In essence the purification of the self. Of course there were a lot of charlatans…</p>
<p>It seems like they want more red than you have given them. That being said I think it&rsquo;s good to sketch out your ideas in black and white and then worry about colors.</p>
<p>Find what you consider to be a powerful typeface and then go from there…</p>
<p>Alchemists used alembics, crucibles and fire to conduct their experiments. It is also the forefather of chemistry. There might be something there, perhaps a chemical symbol…</p>
<p>peace</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Paul,</p>
<p>thanks for the advice.  Forgot to say that they had mentioned they would like the font serpentine included somehow.  Perhaps a variation of another stronger font for the name and media in serpentine would work better.</p>
<p>I really like the idea of alchemists tools, but I thought if use something like that it might take on a whole other meaning visually, so i meant to keep something a bit more abstract. I like the idea of the fire&hellip;a spark, phoenix, rebirth?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well if they asked for serpentine then that is what they shall get… :)</p>
<p>I think your idea about the stronger font for Dynamis and then media in serpentine makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>The fire - yes - now there&rsquo;s a spark - and the phoenix fits in perfectly as does rebirth - that&rsquo;s what real alchemy was really about.</p>
<p>Nice…</p>
<p>Best of Luck!</p>

<p>Set a long line of type set in serpentine. Shrink it to .5 pt. Use it as a rule. Problem solved!</p>
<p>Sorry, I know that isn&rsquo;t much help. I just don&rsquo;t have any clue how to make Serpentine tolerable.</p>
