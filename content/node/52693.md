    because I couldn't find this anywhere. Maybe one of you guys could kill it.\r\n\r\nFWIW,
    I wrote,\r\n\r\n<strong>One arm bandit...</strong>\r\n\r\nI had to press \u2019refresh\u2019
    about 250 times before my version came up...Now I have to go and do something
    far less satisfying/interesting but more important/profitable. Nice work whoever
    coded the new logo(s). Tell me, what font is the \u2019TYPOPHILE\u2019?\r\n\r\nMassive
    choice for the T-shirt and mug range.\r\n"

    they will be simply randomized. However, we haven't been able to complete the
    task (time restrictions + bugs). Going to try again for today\u2026 (sorry guys
    :/)\r\n\r\nRicardo pointed this out in another thread, but I just wanted to give
    a big THANKS to the people that participated in the TypeBattle in which these
    marks were created. We couldn't choose them all, but overall we are very pleased
    with the enthusiasm, not to mention the talent, that came from the community.
    And thanks for your patience! \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/battle27\">Battle
