  angled logo lockup.  Alludes to film &#40;they will make political commercials&#41;,
  and sort of hints at the idea of &#34;red tape&#34; &#40;turning this metaphor on
  its head as they are anti-bureaucracy&#41;. <BR> <BR>My problem is trying to figure
  out how to deal with the contact info.  Should I angle it or keep it horizontal.  My
  goal would be to make it work angled, but it seems to work better on the business
  card than the letterhead. <BR> <BR>Also, if any angled Identities come to mind,
  please pass them along. <BR> <BR>thanks. <BR>peter <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-post.pl?action=posting_upload_form&what=show&img=49543"

  body: I don&#39;t mind that the logo is the only angled element. It helps it stick
    out a bit.  <BR> <BR>It does seem to work well on the card, though. I like the
    staggered one. Working on the diagonal actually gives you a bit more room in terms
    of line lengths to work with. <BR> <BR>BTW, very nice solution overall. Have you
    considered actually getting sticker-tape with that printed on it? &#40;Kind of
    like the continuous rolls of printed tape they stick on your gallons of milk at
    the grocery store...&#41;

  body: 'thanks guys.  there&#39;s been some discussion that having the contact info
    and the logo on a diagonal might be too much. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m torn.  Letterhead
    B from my second post I like a lot, but then A from the first post is looking
    good to me again. <BR> <BR>Question: If I do angle the info on the business card,
    then I should probably do it on the letterhead as well, correct?'

  body: A from the first post is the best one. compact, personality and clean &#40;fewer
    small elements salted in the layout&#41;, Nice. I would just rethink the business
    card. Looks weak, it should be bolder. try swap colors, red background, separate
    info in front/back could help. The size compromises the look of both elements
    in the same space.  <BR> <BR>cheers <BR>h

  body: '&#62; <BR> <BR>I think it would weaken the association. But I am going to
    try it anyway. Just so you call know I am working on a diagonal pattern of CAN
    letters that spell can diagonally up and down. This will be full coverage on the
    back of the card. And might be reversed out over red. <BR> <BR>Will post that
    here shortly. <BR> <BR>Q: would it be bad form to stagger the type on the card,
    but not stagger it on the letterhead &#40;like in A&#41;? <BR> <BR>Seems like
    staggering on the letterhead isn&#39;t working. <BR> <BR>Posts coming soon. Thanks
    for the feedback.'

  body: I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about synching the B-card and letterhead to
    that fine of a level. They&#39;re different things, and no-one puts them side-by-side
    and critiques them. <BR> <BR>Well, except for us.

  body: Helder.  your idea about the red band is appealing.  I am just wondering if
    it should be implemented throughout the system.  Doesn&#39;t seem to work as well
    on the letterhead as the card. <BR> <BR>Thoughts?   <BR> <BR>thanks again for
    all the feedback.  it has helped. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49643.gif"

  body: Well, actually you might aply that to the system. But it&#39;s up to u, either
    you do it or not it&#39;s stil same strong identity, just 2 diferent aplications.
    I rally like your aproach to this project, but I would simplify it a bit. Try
    this, white ifon in the red background in one side, all red not pattern, pattern
    is dated, always, after a while you get tired of that, doesn&#39;t matter how
    nice it looks at first sight. logo in the other side exactly how it is. Again,
    I know you like assymetry that&#39;s ok. In type that is given beautifully by
    left alignment. so why do you got stuck in tha stagged type. doesn&#39;t work
    for, just look a wank design. you are mixing too  much in my opinion. SIMPLE AND
    EFFECTIVE, keep in mind.

  body: Helder, <BR>I think I might agree with you on the staggering, I just need
    to convince the client/the group.  It does look kind of wank <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  But it also works too.  To my eyes this morning though,
    the cleaner the better. <BR> <BR>The pattern is also there to imply the metaphor
    of lots of people in a network.  Which the goal of this group, build a big network
    of creatives nationwide, ready to help out on progressive media projects.  <BR>
    <BR>I also like how phrenetic and &#34;active&#34; it is.

  body: The only thing I might look at in the pattern &#40;wich i think will add a
    nice touch to the system&#41; is that it takes a while to understand the repetition
    of the acronym &#34;can.&#34; Maybe if the pattern is not about the word can and
    more about the shape that makes the three letters you might come up with more
    pleasing patterns... <BR> <BR>The vertical negative space between can&#39;s in
    different &#34;rows&#34; could improve too...
