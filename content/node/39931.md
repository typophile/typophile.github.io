  article while try to find some history and usage of the serifa font.  It says that
  for the El Paso Times Serifa is to be used for all section flags and for story labels.
  \ \r\n\r\nWhat is a section flag and story label in a newspaper?"

    \"El Paso Times\" on the front of the paper. Interior sections might be called
    \"Sports,\" \"Features\" or \"Local.\" The large type on those pages denoting
    the sections would also be section flags.\r\n\r\nStory labels probably vary from
    paper to paper, but (again) using the El Paso times as an example, they're likely
    referring to something like the \"SPECIAL POW REPORT\" that appears on the front
    to the left. I'm sure they use labels like this for other special reports or spreads.\r\n\r\n-
