  body: "One thing I am wondering about: Do you (plural) think that there is a way
    to convince people who are only hunting for a ID and intending to pirate the font
    that it would be better to buy a license?\r\n\r\nI suspect that this is more than
    this board can do. You probably can\u2019t teach people how much type means to
    you within a single forum thread. What\u2019s the solution? Closing down the type
    ID board will also hurt those who buy fonts, but need to know what they\u2019re
    called. And it would be quite a hassle to keep people from still posting ID requests
    on the other boards. You might combine this with a technical restriction that
    new members may only create new topics after a week or so, but again this would
    also hurt legitimate new members who have a quick question. Even if you succeed
    in effectively banning type IDs from this forum (or scaring away all those who
    ask), potential font pirates will just ask somewhere else and get the answer they
    want. Most of the fonts people look for are not that obscure. And will the remaining
    part of Typophile be any better then? Most users requesting type IDs indeed add
    little or nothing to this community, but they don\u2019t really take away anything
    either. You might be right if you say that assisting font pirates earns this community
    a bad name. But many discussions also show that the distinction between (potential)
    pirates and honest, but clueless users is not as clear cut as it may seem. So
    what should be done?"

  body: "There is no elixir; there is only our participation here - and every action
    matters.\r\n\r\nEnjoying IDing fonts should not go against the grain of what Typophile
    can best do. What can it best do? I'm sorry, but to me IDing fonts hasn't been
    adding anything of value to Typophile - in fact it makes this place less <em>friendly</em>,
    Mike, to the people who actually make fonts!  :-/\r\n\r\nR.: Thank you for thinking
    clearly and openly. I'm not sure I have an ideal solution, but I think the most
    effective thing would be to \"ghettoize\" the ID section; not close it, because
    as you say the ID crowd would simply co-opt the other sections. People who are
    tired of me complaining about the ID crowd harming Typophile should like this
    idea, because I would never frequent their side (although I'd still have to warn
    people on \"my\" side about it as needed).\r\n\r\nBUT: that would require restructuring
    the site, which these days seems like a pipe dream. And I'm not an extremist,
    I am in fact trying promote -actually, force- a <em>practical</em> solution. So
    what about this compromise:\r\n\r\nI think we should all be able to tolerate \"silent
    piracy\". But there are cases where we shouldn't look the other way. And certainly
    not help any public offenders! Here are some scenarios:\r\n- When a newbie asks
    for a free alternative to a commercial font, at least think twice. Who are you
    helping, and who are you hurting?\r\n- Considering how hard it is to make a good
    typeface, for any free font a little red flag should go up: before you recommend
    it worry at least a little bit about where it might have come from; and don't
    have an allergic reaction when somebody brings up the possibility that it might
    be a case of outline theft (in fact it's often really quite clear to people who
    have been oogling type for 30 years, when most people have no clue).\r\n- When
    a user acts like piracy is OK, or they mention that they ended up finding that
    commercial font for free, all of us should pounce. Sadly this almost never happens!
    No need to insult the user, just make our displeasure clear. Clarify that this
    is a community that thinks there's more to type than simply using it; we care
    where it must necessarily come from: effort! The users who leave as a result were
    really not meant to be here; some of them will start respecting a demographic
    they were barely aware of before - or at the very least keep their mouths shut;
    and some of them will keep doing it - those should really be ejected.\r\n\r\nA
    little bit of integrity and mindfulness, keeping in check the titillation apparently
    felt by some in helping ID fonts with no regard for any consequences. It's not
    about being squeaky-clean - hey, I'm no saint! But there's just not enough respect
    for type around here lately, and we should make an effort to restore it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
