  Valdonega\r\nthat uses the Valdonega Aesthetic Line Centaur (from Monotype cast
  new digitally translated)\r\nSadly the scan cannot show the real feeling, yet, when
  holding the book in hand it has the\r\nanalog printed feeling.\r\nSo Centaur lives
  on quite near to how it once was, I find.\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Innentitel_CentaurVAL_6223.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Seite_CentaurVAL_4685.gif]"

  body: Hmm. Maybe with extra large images it is nicer to just add them as links.

  body: "Hi Eluard!\r\n\r\nThanks that you appreciate it!\r\nWe also used a particular
    method to handle bezi\xE9rs to make the letters look more analog in feeling. To
    avoid also the contrast between staight and curved lines, to make junctions from
    straight lines to serifs more like they were in hotmetal. And in the end a more
    detailed design (f.e. serifs ecc.)\r\n\r\nciao\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nPS. The Stamperia
    Valdonega has one of the highest standards in printing.\r\nThey also did extraordinary
    7-colours printing on the illustrations of this book.\r\n(besides black ink is
    too grey in the scan, but I did that to get the letter forms clearer)"
