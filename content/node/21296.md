  redesigning my own website.\r\n\r\nSo, I think the original design <a href=\"http://www.design839.com/old_website/\">http://www.design839.com/old_website/</a>
  is uninspired, bland, and a little bit dot.com-ish.  It was put together in a few
  hours about a year ago.  I'm embarassed by it, and typically dont refer people to
  it.\r\n\r\nHere's a start on a redesign.  I'd like it to be fairly informal, unpretentious
  and maybe even a little bit fun.\r\n\r\nAny constructive criticism very welcome.\r\n\r\nCheers

  body: "Eh....I prefer your first one. Although done very quick, its got a lot of
    potential. I would work that one completely through.\r\n\r\nFor example, take
    the clean grid you have there and work in some animated interaction. Change the
    pastel colors to something that pops. The new one is funky because theres no sense
    of strong grid. The colors, I feel, are uncontrolled."

  body: "i agree with the above post. the first rendition looks more sophisticated
    and seems to match your company statement in a much better way. it's not without
    flaw and it definitely needs refinement, but there is structure and a sense of
    an underlying grid taking place.\r\n\r\nthe second option feels wimpy and lost.
    the elements have nearly no relation to each and the overlapping lines and angled
    text is annoying to look at. too much is happening at the bottom. i'd say just
    stick with the first approach, work it out a little more, work in some new colors,
    perhaps from the second variation and play with your grid strucutre. i also feel
    the design 839 logo at the bottom right of that version is too large and oddly
    placed in the brown box\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "wow, thanks for your comments.  I'm really surprised though, as i really
    do think the new version could be on its way to being a much better design.  Maybe
    I'm just bored with the old one, which i'm sure is normal when looking at your
    own designs for any amount of time.\r\n\r\nI agree with comments, there's too
    much going on in at the bottom of the new version.  Logo should probably be a
    bit smaller, navigation needs have more of a relationship.  \r\n\r\nMaybe something
    like screenshot_002.gif (attached)\r\n\r\nAny comments on the beginnings of the
    new logo?  This is one of the main reasons I want to redesign - I think the geometric
    logo isnt really working, and its also a little bit hard to say - 'Design, eight
    three nine'.  \r\n\r\nThe 'sense of grid' in the first design is also strengthened
    by the 2 column content layout.  Maybe this influencing your comments here?"

  body: "thoughts on site: the left bottomhand is getting better. it doesnt look AS
    disjoined from the rightside any longer but i'm still not a fan of the weaving
    colors in the way you have made them do this. perhaps it's just that they are
    underneath the text and it catches your eye in a bad way? i still like the first
    design better. and yes, this is because of your column layout. the first site
    just has a feeling that someone who had an idea of what they are doing designed
    it. i dont think there's anything majorly wrong with it, i think you should use
    that as your skeleton and upgrade your logo.\r\n\r\nthoughts on logo redesign:
    i'm not a fan of this redesign. yet. maybe if you reduced the space between the
    words, killed the arc-ing effect you have on it and started without a line around
    the edges you'll be able to see the obvious problems. i'd suggest starting bare
    bones with the logo, in it's own file, away from the web application and playing
    with joinging some of the parts of the letters? i'd also maybe try a big 8 to
    the left and a three nine speeled out to the right? the position of the spelled
    out three to the left is confusing. see if you  can pack them in together? \r\n\r\nbut
    please post again with an update. it's always exciting to see the process. you
    just had it down on that first website attempt. nice job\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "Thanks guys.  \r\n\r\nwell, it seems that the original design at www.design839.com
    is overwhelmingly more popular than the attempted redesign so far.  I'm getting
    a little bit confused at which design specifically people are talking about though.
    \ \r\n\r\nWM, your comments make sense, cheers, thanks for the thoughtful input.\r\n\r\nill
    sans and dezcom: when you say '1st one' do you mean the original (www.design839.com)
    or the first redesign (screenshot.gif)?\r\n\r\nSince your comments, i've done
    some more variations on the redesign.  Lets call these screenshot_003 and screenshot_004
    respectively.\r\n\r\nI think screenshot_004 is a stronger design, and it still
    has the solid content grid, which i never had intention of getting rid of, because
    I think it does work well.  My only concern is that the navigation isnt obvious
    enough.  Hidden away in the bottom left corner, attached to the footer, this could
    easily be mistaken for a tagline, and might read \"About advertising web print
    contact\", which is just odd if you say it out loud.\r\n\r\nScreenshot_003 tries
    to deal with this issue by introducing the ubiquitous navigation tabs.  But i
    dont like it.  It looks cheap.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?\r\n\r\nWell, i think I might
    take everyones advice and simply upgrade the existing design.  To start i think
    i'll give it new fresher colours, and new logo, and some subtle curves.  That
    should go a long way towards livening it up.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Not loving the tabs--at all. You're using cheap tricks here with the bevels,
    gradients, drop shadows. I think you need to think about this website long and
    hard. Remember that its not just a page with page and tabs, its a fun interaction
    for the user. Make it stand out conceptually. I don't care how amazing you are
    with photoshop and HTML, if you dont have a  concept, its gonna show immediately.
    Sorry if Im harsh but you're heading the wrong direction.

    concept can easily be mistaken for a gimmick.  A web page doesnt have to be cool,
    or have something special, it needs to be functional.  I think its much more about
    giving people access to information and having them feel good about the experience.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not trying to discredit a well thought out and nicely executed concept.  There's
    always a place for that.  But I dont think its the holy grail.\r\n\r\nI'll be

    far,  and value all of your opinions, but lets keep it objective and possibly
    constructive if we can - much appreciated.\r\n"

  body: "it sounds like a bigger discussion regarding concepts and ideas...\r\n\r\ni
    agree with prakash in that concepts are important, fundamental and key for sound
    design. the skeleton upon which aesthetic skin is molded\r\n\r\nanyway...\r\n\r\ni
    dont think there is a right/wrong direction...i had originally stated i thought
    it was the right direction but really this is up for interpretation. obviously.
    \r\n\r\ni do not like photoshop tricks either, but if you think your viewer would,
    then by all means, perform glossy button tab magic. \r\n\r\ni think as long as
    your structure is there, the design and layout will fill out nicely. i just think
    there is a difference these days with a design aesthetic and a true design layout/concept.
    dont let the attempt at creating perfect glass-like tabs or buttons be confused
    for true design. eye candy is just that. it's only a way to hook someone in like
    a flashing neon sign. it doesnt mean it's well laid out.\r\n\r\nok..just really
    needed to get some of that out\r\n\r\nw|m"

    i've rearranged the grid to something a bit more flexible, I've tried to drop

    out the heavy black bar and replace it with some of the colors you are pushing
    in your new design. The current logo isn't much, so play with that too."
