  the font used in the attached image?\r\n\r\nIt is all I have to go by....the most
  unique feature seems to be the sideways e.\r\n\r\nI tried identifont and whatthefont,
  neither of which provided anything useful.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is familiar with the
  font being used, I would be most grateful.\r\n\r\nThankyou"

    sure to post on the right place next time. Perhaps this post could be moved as
    well?\r\n\r\nI actually found the entire graphic I was looking for, which has
    more of the letters to go by.\r\n\r\nhttp://tf-media.net/themes/deco/logo.png\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the e and the f, it seems to be a different font from SF New Republic. Would
    it perhaps be one in the same family?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    be New Republic customised for the logo."

  body: It seems like a lot of work to modify several characters in a font....the
    f and e seem quite different?

  body: Since this is a freebie, there might be a few versions of it out there. That
    <strong>f</strong> is the only major discrepancy between your sample and the font
    linked above. I wouldn't say there is a lot customization needed.
