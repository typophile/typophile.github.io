  the mods (Thank again Dan!)\r\n\r\nI'm an avid ambigram designer, and have been
  the content editor & writer for Ambigram.com for approximately 4 years now. Recently
  I've started working on a book called Ambigrams Revealed, which has been accepted
  by PeachPit Press & will be published in March 2013. The book will be an international
  collection of ambigrams, case studies, tutorials and other content, along with a
  phenomenal judging panel which consists of three well known ambigram artists/critics
  and three well known graphic designers. \r\n\r\nThe website for the book is [[http://www.ambigramsrevealed.com/|Ambigrams
  Revealed]] . It explains what the book is, details who is on the judging panel,
  and explains what type of submissions we are looking for. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we're
  accepting submissions until July 31st. After that, the participants will be chosen
  within a week and those accepted into the book will be sent a confirmation email.
  \r\n\r\nFeel free to post questions regarding the book/submissions here or feel
  free to email me with any questions: nikita@ambigram.com. \r\n\r\nLooking forward
  to seeing some fantastic submissions, and thanks in advance to everyone!\r\n\r\nNikita\r\n\r\n________________________\r\n\u026Fo\u0254\u02D9\u026F\u0250\u0279\u0183\u0131q\u026F\u0250@\u0250\u0287\u0131\u029E\u0131u\r\n\u026Fo\u0254\u02D9\u026F\u0250\u0279\u0183\u0131q\u026F\u0250

    aren't just a cute exercise. And if you want a reason for my opinion, I'll let
    you know in March 2013. ;)"
