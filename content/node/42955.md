body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use RoboFab control the sidebearing of glyphs.\r\n\r\nI
  was thinking something like this might work.\r\n\r\nThis code just prints the sidebearing
  - 20, what I really wanted to do is decrease the left sidebearing by 20.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfrom
  robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\n\r\nA = f['A'].leftMargin\r\n\r\nA-=20\r\n\r\nprint
  A\r\n\r\nf.update()\r\n\r\n</code>"

    and then go to: actions/metrics/set side bearings. '

    think I was trying to do this with my first attempt.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfrom robofab.world

  body: "How can I do the same, but using the 'measurement line'?\r\nI mean: To measures
    the distance from, let say, the middle of the x-height instead if the first left
    point.\r\n"

    the margins of a glyph at a requested height (or width)\r\n\r\n[[http://code.robofab.com/browser/trunk/Lib/robofab/pens/marginPen.py|link
