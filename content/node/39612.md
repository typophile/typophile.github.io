    exactly on the money and I have the feeling this is a font, not a custom design.

    this thread. I wouldn't call the modifications needed to approximate the logo
    "very slight".

  body: "nope ... the *obviously* posts seemed snarky, but not saying that's necessarily
    a bad thing. Passion about a Type ID is a feature, not a bug. And snarkiness is
    always a possibility when people are talking across the ocean, and not the conference
    table. ;)\r\n\r\nthat said, the Arnell Group has some great designers on staff,
    so it's quite possible that the whole thing is custom. (Based on Sackers or Engravers
    or even Trade Gothic Extended.)"

    my comment about someone in-house doing a custom logo \u2014 these are basic forms
    that any experienced type designer could craft in 10-15 minutes.\r\n\r\nmaybe
    there was a directive to do something from scratch, similar to Sackers, with a

  body: "Ignacio got closest with Sackers Gothic Light Small Caps, slightly modified.
    Mainly the A, N, and E. \r\n\r\nI admit that Trade Gothic Extended was a quick
    guess [as such it wasn't bad] and maybe I should have called it 'similar', but
    I don't think mkstudio is trying to recreate the logo, just looking for a similar
    typeface (for which it qualifies).  \r\n\r\n>> Trade Gothic Extended is further
    removed than any other suggestion made in this thread.<<\r\nBald, you know that's
    an overstatement.  \r\n\r\n>> Please keep in mind that \u2014 as this is a logo
    \u2014 this could very well be custom designed or at least customized.<<\r\nAn
    earlier, more productive and unemotional contribution by Bald Cond -- qualities
    that haven't come across from Jan (obviously) (yet). \r\n\r\nI just realized that
    the way I ended up in this Type ID forum was directly through Google, and I didn't
    know I was in such a specific forum. Once you're in there, the heading is easy
    to miss, kind of like shark fins in the ocean. That explains why I made a quick
    guess without doing my homework. \r\n\r\n"
