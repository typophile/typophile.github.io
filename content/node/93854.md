  to go on, and those present certainly look hand-drawn.\r\n\r\nIs there something
  similar available that has the broad/narrow components (narrow on the left of the
  \u2018A\u2019 but narrow on the right of the \u2018N\u2019) and the distinctly oblate
  appearance of the \u2018O\u2019?\r\n\r\nI'm not expecting there to be a perfect
  match, but I would like to get as close as I can. Thank you.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/apollo_program

    if you remember that bringing a typeface to market was a far more costly affair
    in the Dark Ages before desktop publishing.\r\n\r\nI mean, seriously: it doesn\u2019t
    take a rocket scientists to see that the S is entirely out of place with the rest
    of the characters.\r\n\r\nAlthough it\u2019s entirely possible that a rocket scientists
    lettered this odd curio\u2026"

  body: "As Nick notes, the style is pretty inconsistent: You could find such treatment
    of N and A in some art deco faces (but no such O).\r\nI think you could get close
    to the overall feeling with the heavier weights of Britannic (or similar)."

    body: "Thank you, folks, for taking the time to respond, I appreciate it.  I kind
      of guessed that responses would be along those lines.  As I said in my opening
      post I thought they were hand drawn and probably wouldn't turn up as fonts per
      se .... but no harm in trying to elicit something that might be close.\r\n\r\nI'll
      leave this thread for a few more days, just to see if someone has a trump card
      up their sleeve that (reasonably closely) fits the bill.  If not, I'll just
      have to accept that it is not meant to be.   ;-)"
