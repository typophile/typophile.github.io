body: A friend of mine is gonna start a new international company in The Netherlands.
  He hired a freelance designer to design his corporate identity. Today he showed
  me the results, now I looked at it, and the type looked like a font from a know
  foundry. Although it looks almost the same as shape, but his curves and style is
  more condensed than the original font. I have seen the process of building it in
  steps he saved as pdf. He really designed it himself.  <BR> <BR>Now my friend is
  wondering if he can get accused for breaking copyrights, as it looks the same, but
  in details it isn&#39;t the same. Who knows? As I couldn&#39;t give him a right
  answer, but he&#39;s still in doubt, as I mentioned it looked like a known font
  from a commercial type foundry. Who knows about laws and copyright? In my eyes it
  is possible that someone in japan makes something similar looking like someone in
  europe... But I was just wondering too how court would handle this. <BR> <BR>Who
  knows?
