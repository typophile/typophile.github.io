    body: Yes, some of these had a lower-case g that was quite similar, but still
      no cigar. Thank you, though. Much appreciated.

    body: "Awesome.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely the same font, at 45% character width \u2013
      perhaps not Adobe's (OpenType) version, though, as some details are ever so
      slightly off (like the serifs on the capital T's that appear to be a bit longer
      on the posters). But other than some very discrete differences like that everything
      else appears to be the same.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!"
