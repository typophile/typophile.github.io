  body: "Hi Eric. I'm not really sure about this, but then I'm not an expert on ancient
    Greek mythology. I'll have a go at it regardless.\r\n\r\nThis creature has the
    general appearance of a sphinx, but the anatomical details do not match those
    of the well-known Egyptian sphinx. It has the coiled tail/body and scales of a
    Greek hippocamp---a sea-going creature with with a horse's torso and the tail
    of a sea serpent. It's front legs resemble those of a horse, it's head is human,
    and it has human breasts.\r\n\r\nSomehow I don't think it is ancient Greek, but
    I'd give it at least 25% chance of being Greek. It looks like something from classical
    antiquity. Hold on and I'll see if I can get a positive ID on it for you.\r\n\r\nj

  body: It's the Greek Sphinx, representing destruction and bad luck. She's the daughter
    either of Chimera, or Typhon and Echidna. The Greek Sphinx is described as a woman
    with the body of a lion, eagle's wings, and a serpent's tail, but everybody's
    used to seeing the Egyptian Sphinx at Giza, which is only half-man, half-lion.

  body: 'I should have mentioned that the Greek Sphinx is part of the Oedipus myth.
    The Sphinx sat outside Thebes and asked all the travelers that passed her a riddle;
    if they answered incorrectly, she killed them. Oedipus answered the riddle, which
    was "What goes on four legs in the morning, on two legs at noon, and on three
    legs in the evening?" Since Oedipus answered correctly (a man, or more PC, a person),
    the Sphinx had to destroy herself. '

    the Greek Sphinx: \"She was represented in vase-painting and bas-reliefs most
    often seated upright rather than recumbent, as a winged lion with a woman's head;
    or she was a woman with the paws, claws and breasts of a lion, a serpent's tail
    and eagle wings.\"\r\n\r\nYet all illustrations show her with a lion's tail, unlike
    the coiled serpent's tail/body in this illustration. That's what disuaded me from

    just says half-lion, half-woman. There are also references to the Sphinx as just
    having wings and a lion's body, but no tail -- [[http://www.greek-gods.info/monsters/sphinx/|here]],
    for instance.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Sphinx has come to mean enigmatic, but given
    the Greek backstory, I'm not sure I'd want it as my logo.\r\n"
