body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI am back with a problem that had me gone nuts over the
  last weeks. I am developing a corporate logo for an engineering company called \"AMG\",
  the client is quite happy with the \"AMG\" text and the three colored squares on
  top of it but, both me and my client, are quite quizzed about the text underneath
  the main text( engineering).\r\n\r\nI feel like it's all wrong but I can't find
  a solution. Ihave no clue of what font could fit nicely in the composition. Do you
  have some suggetions?\r\n\r\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/i/amgo.png/\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help,\r\nPierluig "

  body: "Maybe you could explain some of the reasons why you chose the 3 squares and
    the style of the AMG text.  Without knowing what this is intended to communicate
    or what concepts went into it so far, it is kind of hard to suggest some ways
    to refine the subtitle.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is not quite working is the scalability
    of this mark.  It looks fine at larger sizes, but as it gets smaller, it will
    loose definition and clarity.  The small cuts in the letters will be invisible
    and the squares will be tiny dots.  I would work toward something that will maintain
    its appearance at 1cm width.  Good start!"

  body: 'I agree with Luma Vine about the scalability; your logo isn''t going to work
    in small sizes. Try printing the logo postage-stamp size (or smaller) and you''ll
    see the problem. '
