  to discuss this new way.\r\nhttp://www.dontclick.it\r\n\r\nDo you think that one
  day we will surf the internet without useing our hands at all?"

  body: I think there is a lot of potential for something like this. Of course, the
    current set of interface design theory would have to morph. 2 thumbs up. Thoroughly
    enjoyable.

  body: What about right clicking to bring up menus? What about click and drag for
    selections? Within the context of this site, which requires only simple navigation,
    no clicking is ok. But I think that so long as we have to drag mice about rather
    than do everything through the keyboard (like in the old days) because it adds
    functionality which reduces the amount of stressful wrist movements with the mouse
    that can make carpal tunnel problems happen. This is why I personally prefer the
    greater comfort of my tablet, despite the fact that it takes up most of my desk!

  body: "Great site, a very interesting concept.\r\n\r\n2Nepenthe: dragging can be
    easily reilzed within the idea (e.g. you hold cursor over the obejct you've got
    to drag for 5 secs, then it sticks to the cursor and moves till you cursor remains
    still for 5 secs). The major issue here is usability.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of tablets,
    do you use the tablet's pen for plain surfing and navigation through software
    windows? I prefer the tablet's mouse with mine, using pen only in Photoshop."

  body: "It's a very interesting concept, but it's all Flash and there are no unique
    URLs per page or area, which runs counter to many of the underlying concepts of
    the web and accessibility in the first place.\r\n\r\nBut judged as an interactive
    concept alone, it's intriguing. I find all of the movement and reconfiguration
    to be a bit much, and the information density would require a lot of handling
    and segmenting so an errant mouse hit wouldn't send the user flying through the
    site.\r\n\r\nThis all sounds negative, but I do like it."

  body: It's a nice idea. I agree with Chris...too much Flash. Too many websites do
    this and make it difficult to navigate their site. Like Chris was saying, with
    no unique URLs you can't hit the back button and go to information that you were
    just looking at. As a guy who gets "mouse cramps" on his hand pretty frequently,
    I'd love to see an interface that just used keyboard commands. Sometimes I hate
    "meeces to pieces."

  body: "There is some opinions as I see, let's speak about the line which say the
    site is full of flash: no unique URL. I think this opinion is true. But I think
    if we think of future of web to make it like  a huge multimedia web.. then this
    site will be a good move. \r\nThe site was speaking about to use click or not
    to use click, it looks like how scientists think in planes, that they try these
    days to make the driver of the plane drive it with his head only, I saw a documentary
    in Discovery Science about that case, which reflects that they are moving forward
    in this technology in solid steps. Let me say this site is very good as a source
    for designer who work on flash as web or as CD that it is not necessary to make
    all your buttons click able! What if you made a button some place in an interactive
    CD or site working by rolling over your courser on it? It may do a strange effect.\r\nSorry
    for speaking a lot, but let me declare things by graphics. I made here a small
    experiment to describe what I mean, this may be used as a surprise for the person
    who suppose to click.\r\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/view/20981312/\r\nSurprised
    ?\r\nI saw a file like that in past, by someone I know in channel flash I guess
    while I was learning Macromedia Flash in 1999, I just made something like it to
    show you.\r\n\r\n"
