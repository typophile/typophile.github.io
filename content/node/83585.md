  body: "They're actually using [[http://vikingcycles.com/|a typeface as webfont]]
    which is simply called \"Viking\". So I guess they're using the same corporate
    typeface for woodmark.\r\nIt makes me also thinking about Darden Studio main woodmark,
    which could be seen [[http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/0/6840/116678/DardenStudioLogo_01_1.jpg|here]]
    and [[http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/0/6840/116678/DardenStudioCards_Group_02_1.jpg|here]].
    Looks pretty close to me. Unfortunately, part of [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection|United
    Sans]] (hardly tweaked), don't any commercial font that looks like this."
