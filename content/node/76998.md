body: "I think I may not understand correctly how lookupflags and glyph types work,
  and was hoping someone might be able to clarify this for me.\r\n\r\nI have a piece
  of code like the following in a font:\r\n\r\n<code>lookup A { </code>\r\n\r\n<code>\_\_lookupflag
  IgnoreMarks; </code>\r\n\r\n<code>\_\_sub @X' @Y by @Z; </code>\r\n\r\n<code>} A;
  </code>\r\n\r\nIn the glyph properties window in FLS5 I've assigned all of the combining
  diacritics to the 'marks' class and in my FLS5 preferences I've made sure that the
  'generate GDEF table' option is set. I'd assumed that the above code would work
  effectively the same as the following pseudocode, but apparently not.\r\n\r\n<code>lookup
  A { </code>\r\n\r\n<code>\_\_sub @X' @Y by @Z; </code>\r\n<code>\_\_sub @X' @CombiningDiacritics
  @Y by @Z; </code>\r\n<code>\_\_sub @X' @CombiningDiacritics @CombiningDiacritics
  @Y by @Z; </code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_. </code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_. </code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_.
  </code>\r\n\r\n<code>} A; </code>\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the presence of <code>
  lookupflag IgnoreMarks </code> has no affect whatsoever on the behaviour of the
  font. What am I missing here?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    [+ \"macroncomb\" + [\"acutecomb\"]] + something\r\n\r\nwith additional positioning
    (mark/mkmk) for \"a.alt\"?\r\n\r\nIf this is something else, what is it?\r\n\r\nAnd
    what about monotremes?"

  body: "I used X, Y, and Z because there are several different instances where this
    arises in my font, but I'll give a more specific example here:\r\n\r\nLet's say
    O has an alternate forms O.alt which is only appropriate before letters with vertical
    left stems.\r\n\r\nSo I construct a substitution like\r\n\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_sub
    O' [B D E F H I K L M N P R]  by O.alt; </code>\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like, though,
    is to have the above substitution work even for strings such as the following:\r\n\r\nO
    dotbelowcomb circumflexcomb N\r\n\r\nI'd assumed that skipmarks would achieve
    this, but either it doesn't, or I am doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nFor purposes
    of this discussion, I'm more interested in m\u1ED9notremes than monotremes.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
