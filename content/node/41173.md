  a project which includes Deck's <strong>Template Gothic</strong>, and I need to
  get hold of him to let him know i'm using it, and I think he may just be interested.
  \r\n\xB6It's for the DetAD student brief to redesign FUSE. \r\n\xB6If anyone can
  shed some light on an email address (the one on his website is dead, and says to
  call some lady, but I can't afford to call across the Atlantic on my mobile!), that
  would be helpful. \r\n\r\n\r\n\xB6Ta ta for now. \r\n\r\n\xB6P\r\n"

  body: Patrick, the reason for spelling an address "occupant-AT-..." instead of "occupant@..."
    is to keep evil spambots from harvesting said address for their nefarious purposes...  :-)

    that one then\u2013 but it did look like the address was written like that because
    of the bracketed adjective. \r\n\r\nI've sent one off, let's see if I get a reply.
