body: its amazing how the Eygiptian inscriptions have the effect like its embossed
  on the stone and the Roman inscriptions are debbossed into the stone. why is this?
  is it because of the method of carving that may have been done or am i just asking
  something that is out of this world and has np answer? :)

    (at least on the Trajan Column) are cut with a v-cut. I think that most ancient
    Egptian hieroglyphs were more scooped out than carved\u2026 the cut would look
    more rectangular tha v-shapped."

    better, due to being underground (and possibly due to better paint technology
    too - after all they'd been doing it much longer). It could also be due to the
    typical lighting they're respectively seen under.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "> almost like a modern uppercase Roman.\r\n\r\nI'm no expert, but it could
    hypothetically be as early as the 2nd century AD. As I've mention in my \"Latinization:
    Prevention and Cure\" article, the Greek letterforms started drifting towards
    the Roman ideals pretty much from the moment of political conquest. I have a photo
    of an inscription at Delphi from that earliest period; it even says \"TRAIAN\"
    in the text!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
