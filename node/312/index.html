		<div class="commentbody">Andrew, this is really an interesting premise. Is the limit 20  <BR>because of budget? I think if you hand-picked 100 typefaces <BR>you&#39;d have a great start. <BR> <BR>In my school we had the entire Bitstream library and some  <BR>basics form Adobe. The result was first-year students all <BR>crowding around the bitstream poster looking for a cool,  <BR>different font and ending up with Copperplate &#40;gasp!&#41; or  <BR>Bank Gothic &#40;egads!&#41; or worse; Mistral, Hobo, Handel or  <BR>Balloon gothics &#40;pow! biff! splat! oof!&#41;. <BR> <BR>In those early years, design students are so caught up  <BR>trying to find what&#39;s cool, that they don&#39;t learn what works.  <BR>&#40;I know there are always exceptions...&#41; <BR> <BR>My school has since purchased the entire HTF library,  <BR>kudos to them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You know, I&#39;m not sure I can think of 20 typefaces that I would recommend as a beginning library. Once you get beyond a small number of solid text faces and a couple of good titling and sans serif designs, you quickly get into that area in which the right typeface to have is the right typeface for a particular project. Take script faces, for example: I can suggest a number of good ones, <i>i.e.</i> types that are well designed and executed, in a variety of different styles, but I don&#39;t think any of them necessarily belong in a beginner library because each tends to be particularly suited to such a narrow range of work. <BR> <BR>On the seriffed text typeface front, I would suggest selecting one example from each of the major historical styles: one Venetian, one French renaissance, one Dutch oldstyle, one neo-classical, one romantic, etc. I would try to avoid the more obvious choices, <i>e.g.</i> Mardersteig&#39;s Dante instead of Bembo, Monotype Bullmer instead of Baskerville.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i think 20 type faces is perfect. this is what i tell my class to begin with. the idea that you need hundreds of typefaces is ridiculous. when i was in school i had thousands upon thousands of bad typefaces. i hoarded anything i could get. this only helped confuse me when it came to choosing an appropriate face. it was a breath of fresh air to just delete them all off my hard drive. i only use about 10 or so at any moment in my career. type can be tricky and hard to deal with. it is best to have fewer faces and understand the ins and outs of each one. this is the only way one can expect to master a typeface and type in general. <BR> <BR>i think it is also important to avoid display faces. these can be made individual depending on the project and current aesthetic. i make all of my own display faces or i am at least very picky about a display face made by someone else. no matter how trendy and cool the display face is you will look back in 10 years and think to your self &#34;what the hell was i thinking&#34; <BR> <BR>anyway here is the list of classics i use. <BR> <BR>akzidenz grotesk bq <BR>helvetica neue  <BR>avenir &#40;or futura, both are geometric sans, i prefer avenir&#41; <BR>frutiger <BR>trade gothic <BR>franklin gothic <BR>optima <BR>bodoni &#40;or didot but not filosofia&#41; <BR>adobe garamond <BR>adobe caslon <BR>minion <BR>hoefler <BR>dante <BR>sabon <BR>perpetua <BR>requiem &#40;or bembo&#41; <BR>centaur <BR>clarendon <BR>shelly &#40;or snell roundhand&#41; <BR>fette fraktur &#40;or goudy text&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that limiting the list to 20 faces is an excellent idea. It is a good way to teach typography. With a limited selection students can see how principles work in all of the typefaces you select. It is an excellent way to have them compare and contract the strengths of each face.  <BR> <BR>Becuase of that I would make my list from historic sources. Students would see the evolution of type, and see how that evolution happened as they used the faces. <BR> <BR>Without putting a ton of time considering the faces I&#39;ll throw up a list.  <BR> <BR>Blackletter <BR>Centaur <BR>Janson <BR>HTF Requiem <BR>Bembo <BR>Caslon <BR>Garamond <BR>Baskerville <BR>Palantino <BR>HTF Didot <BR>Perpetua <BR>Electra <BR>Clarendon <BR>Akzidenz Grotesque <BR>Helvetica Neue <BR>Futura <BR>Franklin Gothic <BR>Trade Gothic <BR>Poetica <BR>Shelly <BR> <BR>OK, its a rough list, but it has some solid faces that would be good to learn principles with. </div>

I love Luc&#40;as&#41; work&#41; <BR> <BR>05 &#62; Garamond Pro OTF or NeueSabon  <BR>&#40;Best for setting text. GaramondPro is such a nice redesign, and NeueSabon, although not a Sabon, imo, is a verrrrry nice Garamondesque typeface as well, wish I had the $$$ to buy it.&#41; <BR> <BR>06 &#62; Myriad Pro OTF  <BR>&#40;Great alternative to all those Frutigers, Helveticas and Akzidenz... and the OTF multilangual functionality is beautiful. Great font.&#41; <BR> <BR>08 &#62; Mrs Eaves OTF <BR>&#40;Sooooo cute. So cute. Sooooooooo cute&#41; <BR> <BR>09 &#62; FF OCR or FF Letter Gothic <BR>&#40;For those cool and mechanical designs. Not as cold as the originals, but more versatile&#41; <BR> <BR>10 &#62; Rotis Sans or SemiSans <BR>&#40;Jeez, I hat the Rotis, but when learning typography there is no way around it -- and it still looks nice for many designs that try to be clean and efficient.&#41; <BR> <BR>11 &#62; Futura <BR>&#40;Overused, yeah, but you gotta have it. Lovelovelove the Caps. Instant Warmth, somehow.&#41; <BR> <BR>12 &#62; Scala <BR>&#40;Very nice font - legible yet different. Quadraat would be solid as well. The Scala Sans is a nice alternative to the ThesisSans, more quirky yet not as monstrously complete...&#41; <BR> <BR>13 &#62; TAZ III OTF <BR>&#40;De Groot is a monster, this font rocks. Again, wish I had the money right now. Great stuff.&#41; <BR> <BR>14 &#62; Univers <BR>&#40;Classic. And nice to play with. Look at Emil Ruders work with that single font -- amazing&#41;.  <BR> <BR>15 &#62; Bauer Bodoni <BR>&#40;Must-have-classicism for your students. And great to play with in Display-size&#41; <BR> <BR>16 &#62; Franklin Gothic or Bureau Grotesque <BR>The strong and strudy workhorses. Also, you can use Franklin to let your students do a bit Brodyism. <BR> <BR>17 &#62; Bell Gothic or Interstate <BR>Looking modern yet not too modern. Nice for Corporate stuff, although lacking in some departments &#40;Caps, Ligaturs, OSFs&#41;. Both nice because of their not-too-cold-coldness. Used ALL-CAPS-Bell for a CD just some months ago, it just was perfect.  <BR> <BR> <BR>18 &#62; Jenson Pro OTF or Warnock Pro or Kepler <BR>More older-looking quirky text-fonts. OTF rocks.  <BR> <BR>19 &#62; Thesis Serif or Thesis Mono  <BR>The serif is just beautiful for short texts, the Mono has a more lively approach to the coldness of OCR and Letter Gothic. <BR> <BR>20 &#62; Zapfino CD <BR>wonderful Toy. Next best thing to being a calligraphic genius yourself :-D. &#40;Which, alas, I ain&#39;t&#41; <BR> <BR>And a whole buch of those endless TTF-Freefonts available on the net, just to have some plain fun with &#40;which is why some </div>

It has most of the OpenType Pro fonts in it: Caslon, Garamond, Jenson, Minion, Myriad, Warnock, Utopia... plus other extremely useful fonts from Adobe. Very good value. I bought it just before I graduated! It&#39;s only a 1 computer license though, but I think you could get site licenses for the school. <BR> <BR>URL: <BR><a href="http://www.adobe.com/education/ed_products/typeclassics.html" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/education/ed_products/typeclassics.html</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t feel comfortable with the idea of students downloading free fonts off the &#39;net for their projects. More often than not they end up using something really badly made without even realizing that it is not a &#39;professional quality&#39; font. It&#39;s dangerous. It&#39;s such a bad influence for them because they&#39;ll end up thinking that fonts are free and anyone can make fonts. Not a good idea. Though I think it&#39;s also a typography instructor&#39;s duty to teach their students how to discern the differences between well and badly made typefaces, and about the legalities of typeface licensing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think everyones comments are very helpful. i think the one point I have to clarify is that we are talking about 20 typefaces that a designer should know as part of their job. Many graduate designers have not yet came to grips with more than, say,5 typefaces. The idea here is to push students into using a limited number of type designs, during certain projects, and see how their typographic awareness increases along with their knowledge of the &#39;20 typefaces&#39;. Ive already included comic sans, minstrel and brush script so there is no need to include them in future post! ;&#41; On leaving university they should be able to identify each of the designs, and be able to adjust their use according to the project. Its OK to have a favourite type design, but worrying when they try to use it for the wrong job!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that ITC Garamond campaign was such a brilliant idea. Simple and powerful and its a hilarious inside joke. Just love it. I want one of those tee-shirts! I would happily use ITC Garamond instead of Helvetica any day :-&#41; It&#39;s so 80s! &#40;I hate Helvetica, by the way ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I know I lot of typographers/type designers can&#39;t stand ITC Garamond. Apart from the enormous x-height, the rounded treatment on absolutely everything is a bit much. I don&#39;t mind it as a display face for certain things. I wonder what you guys think of it? And why do you think Apple dropped their Apple Garamond Narrow &#40;they redrew from the ITC condensed version which I think was a much more plausible type&#41;? I think it was a stupid decision because it was such a strong element in their corporate identity. They were desperate to be more &#39;modern&#39; I guess. But Myriad?! That&#39;s someone else&#39;s corporate type!</div>

I mean, the latter is certainly the village idiot &#40;and one who persists in thinking he&#39;s a studmuffin&#41;, but the former is the insidious town charlatan. And can you really like the way &#34;Macintosh&#34; rendered out in it, with that domestic-abused &#34;t&#34; and such? <BR> <BR>There are many depths to which one can disdain ITC Garamond. Some poeple only mind that it was called a Garamond, since its spirit is so distorted from the original. But that&#39;s too forgiving. You would want to go deeper and hate what it does to French culture: according to some people &#40;like Mandel&#41;, a small x-height is a <i>requirement</i> of being a French font, and Garamond is the Frenchest of them all. And you might go deeper, into functionality, and hate the fact that it combines such gaudy proportions with features only fitting in a serious text face. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, in terms of corporate indentity, I agree that shifting to Myriad was a horrible idea. <BR> <BR>Have a good day!  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Jean. It&#39;s not a Garamond at all. As a student, I was quite confused by the different versions of the supposedly &#39;Garamond&#39;. At one point I was naive enough to think that ITC&#39;s version was THE Garamond! How silly was I? Yes, it does look more like a redrawing of Monotype&#39;s version. And now my favourite &#39;Garamond&#39; is your Sabon Next! <BR> <BR>Hrant, nice reference from MyFont. I always wondered about the Apple Garamond. You know what? I still have the TrueType Apple Garamond Narrow on my computer. It was bundled with my old Color StyleWriter printer. Bitstream did a nice job, I think. Much nicer than the original ITC. Quite a few other fonts were bundled with that printer, including Lucida Bright, Lubalin Graph, etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Heh, Jay, I wasn&#39;t expecting to agree with your list as much as I do. I was beginning to think you only liked helvetica!  <BR>Sabon is one I have used before and will probably use more. I love akzi but it has some things I don&#39;t understand... Why do the em dashes come out almost identical to the ens? With the lining numerals though it makes me not care so much about the short ems. The font overall is ever-so-slightly condensed but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the reason for the dashes being short. Another oddity is that the quotes don&#39;t seem to match very well but their plain-ness is kind of growing on me. <BR>Shelley&#39;s probably my favorite script, unless you just want them to learn how to drown themselves in an expert set such as poetica. Lastly, is stone sans too quirky to make anyone&#39;s list? Either avenir, stone or univers should make the list, if anything, just because of their ranges &#40;thin ultra condensed!? cool but useless?&#41; <BR></div>

Goto: freshly installed operating system. 
Open: design application of choice
Find: font menu
Pull down:See list? 

You are done. 

This is not a trivial recommendation as otherwise the students will have all these bundled families (the school will not be able to delete them), PLUS the 20 families you give them, and thus you will be defeated by such a plan.;) How? Wind blows, fire burns, students rebel. Tell them they can only use "these 20" and you'll see!

http://typophile.com/node/47079

I'm just glad someone actually thinks about the type libraries available to students, so thanks Andy.

-

@James (kindly)
Limiting students is good, for some of their time at university. 
However, excluding economics, what would be the point in limiting students to 20 (or 10 as James mentioned) for their entire duration at college?

-

Why not buy 10 'classic' typefaces and 10 'contemporary' typefaces.
Surely learning involves looking forwards as well as backwards.

Anyway like I said, thank you for even considering the dusty digital type library. There is probably no ideal combination 
Any chance you are at University of the Arts London Andy?

My type class at an accredited art & design university had an official "list of typefaces"; thus insinuating they were faces that learned designers should be familiar with.

On this list were:

Centaur
Jenson
Bembo
(Adobe) Garamond
Minion
Times New Roman
Baskerville
Mrs Eaves

		<div class="commentbody">I think that as you learn about the history of type design certain faces are landmarks in the evolution of type. If the history is taught correctly I think most student designers pick it up along the way. One typeface to mark each major development in the appearance of type will leave you with plently. An appreciation for these typefaces needs to be established. I know students that wouldn't have a breeze about typefaces solely because lectures on type where not common enough on their course. 

For more contemporary type I'm sure the [[http://www.createreject.com/unicef/|unicef]] book could be handy.

If it all works out then you can test your students with [[http://fontgame.ilovetypography.com/|this]].</div>
