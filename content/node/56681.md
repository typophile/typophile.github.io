body: "I was toying around with an idea of a new Vyaz' font for a while now, but the
  sheer mind-boggling amount of ligatures and heavy scripting required to accommodate
  a proper and versatile face seemed unmanageable. Thus, I finally decided that a
  simple vector file would be a better alternative, with a basic modular design, a
  handful of letter alternatives, ligatures and decorative elements, providing the
  user with the freedom to construct their own combinations. here are the first sketches
  of this Idea:\r\n\r\nChurch Slavonic:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vyaz5_4913.gif]\r\n\r\nLonger
  passage without archaic letters:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vyaz4_5848.gif]\r\n\r\nDifferent
  ligature options:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liga_5815.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is what I am trying to base it on:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/historicvyaz_6075.gif]"

    Russian-esque kitch.</em>\r\n\r\nWhy not \"try it and see\". Anyone can have a
    clever idea (or kill it at the concept stage), but until you actually try and
    work out an idea you never know how it will turn out in reality, or what paths
    it will lead down. It's also my experience, having created a few oddball faces,
    that there's always someone somewhere who will find a use for whatever you throw
    down (and it will most likely be something you never anticipated); fonts are the
    perfect \"Long Tail\" product."
