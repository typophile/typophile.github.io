  image link.  I hope it worked.  It did not show up in the preview.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rightsidelabel_4850.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  would be very appreciative for any ideas of the approximate age of this label.  I
  notice the text is different from the background, and the background is not plain
  as I would have expected but dotted upon close magnification, whereas the text is
  solid by comparison.  Thank you for your thoughts."

  body: I'm guessing the pattern is a texture from applying the label to the surface
    rather than a print. Is this on a piece of furniture? What is it? Where is it
    from? Is it inside a violin?

  body: "Looks like a halftone screen to me too, which would suggest it's a reproduction
    label. \r\n\r\nAlso the handwritten \"89\" appears to be the same color as the
    printed text, which might suggest it's a reproduction with everything printed
    using the same brown ink, although that in itself wouldn't be conclusive."

  body: "Good responses all.  Thanks.\r\nYes this is from my favourite violin.  If
    it were a Guiseppe Guadagnini it would be worth minimum 6 figures. (His father's
    are upwards of $1,000,000). The complete label on this violin suggests an apprentice
    to Guiseppe, Felice Beretta which would fetch $50,000.  The luthier friend who
    sold it to me is truly convinced it is a genuine label, but I had my doubts based
    on the style of the violin and I bought it as an unknown fake strictly for the
    sound at a dirt cheap price.\r\nOldnick, I have heard the term halftone before
    (but as a non print person remembered the phrase as half duplex - no wonder I
    couldn't get any decent info).  \r\nThe interesting thing is that there are repair
    marks which indicate a manufacture prior to 1850 (replacement and angle change
    of neck to accommodate pitch change at that time) so I was hoping the label might
    have dated as far back as say 1840 and hence be an \"original fake\".  Dendrochronology
    if it is to be believed has pegged the instrument no earlier than 1820 plus time
    to age the wood.\r\nThe other clue I have which supports JamesM theory is that
    I have in fact seen on eBay what appears to be an identical label but in much
    better condition.  That violin sold for less than $1000 before I came upon mine,
    so I have been unable to study it further as the listing was removed. \r\nIn general
    the condition of the violin suggests a very great age with repairs done by many
    generations of luthiers of varying talents.  The average condition of a decent
    fiddle from 1830-1850 is much better. So it must have been well used.\r\nSo considering
    everything plus other theories and style, my guess is 1835-1840 violin,antiqued
    a bit to pass it off as an earlier work, from a workshop of some quality, bordering
    northern Italy with French and Austrian influence,  and a label inserted after
    1870 by a dealer who looked at the violin and thought he could profit with a better
    label.\r\nWell it has always been a dream to own a great Italian violin. But of
    course to a player it all comes down to quality reproduction of sound and if I
    have that, it doesn't matter where it originates. \r\n\r\nThanks again."
