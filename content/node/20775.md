    newspaper with a short-lived career, had everything designed by E-types. The typeface
    is custom and is a s far as I know not for sale \u2013 even though the Paper folded
    a couple of years ago.\r\n\r\nYou can check the design case at E-types website:
    http://www.e-types.com/visUKProjekt.asp?artikelID=163\r\n\r\nor find more general
    information about the designers here: http://www.e-types.com"

    type collection, but couldn't find anything. The website is extremely user-unfriendly
    though, so there's a slight possibility I overlooked it.

    'Press'. \r\n\r\nIt's still not for sale as far as I know.\r\n\r\nAs you can read
    on the E-types website it won an award. Here's some text:\r\n\r\ne-Types has recieved
    the 'Certificate of Excellence in Type Design' by Type Directors Club in New York.\t\r\n\r\ne-Types
    is awarded for the 34 fonts which were designed for the Danish daily DAGEN. The
    font family is named Press and it was selected by the judges together with 15
    other typographies from all over the world. 120 proposals were sent to Type Directors
    Club.\r\n\r\ne-Types and Press will be featured on exhibitions in Japan, Europe,
    the US and Canada. Furthermore the fonts will be presented in the Type Directors
    Club year book 2003, \"Typography 24\"."
