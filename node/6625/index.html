All that utter bullshit in Europe about them liking Americans but simply having a problem with the government would hopefully collapse*. Gimme a fukking break from that escapist, apologetic feel-good coping mechanism. All that crap about Americans being treated well when they go to France might finally be put in context: what friggin' kind of Americans go to France in the first place - the rifle-toting, pickup-truck driving retards who would vote for a bigoted doorknob?! The closest they'd ever get to Europe is those faux-themed tourist traps in goddam Vegas. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3640754.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3640754.stm</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's gotta get worse before it gets better. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Except for that last post by Hrant, it seems to me that type, typography, design and communication is at the very center of this debate about the memos. I've seen so much on the internet that is just plain wrong (like the suggestion that the Times typeface didn't exist in 1972 - which the majority of folks in this community KNOW to be wrong). There's no question to me that the typophile community has something to say about this matter and that it's relevant to the interests of this site.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And calling Kerry a &quot;two-faced/two-minded political puppet cum mannequin,&quot; feels like a provocation which I won't step up to fight against because that WOULD be very off topic.</div>
