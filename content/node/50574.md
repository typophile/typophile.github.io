  body: I would call this a modular, [[chamfered]], square sans serif. Don't know
    what font it is, but you might like <a href="http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/75313">Skipper</a>.

  body: Thx. Skipper is nice, but a bit wider than this sample. Any other ideas about
    what this face might be?
