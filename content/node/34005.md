body: "I have a weird problem with a PDF.\r\n\r\nI made a specimen with InDesign featuring
  a typeface I made. When I print the PDF from Acrobat all the letters are overlapped
  on top of each other. \r\n\r\nScanned page:\r\nhttp://www.re-type.com/notaweblog/images/print-caca.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  PDF look perfect on screen and if I print from InDesign there is no problem. The
  embedding permits of the fonts are set to 'everything is allowed'.\r\n\r\nApparently
  the problem is with inkjet printers (only with this font). Laser  printers seem
  to print the specimen with no problem.\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback."

  body: Have you checked to make sure your drivers for your inkjet printer are up
    to date? It seems like a tracking issue with the print head. The signals from
    the computer aren't translating properly to the printer and that's usually a driver
    issue.

  body: "I think it has more to do with the file, but most likely the embedded font.
    It almost looks like if the sidebearings and spaces have disappeared or something.\r\nI
    don't think it's the printer itself, if the tracking of the printhead was off,
    the horizontal lines would not print either? Also the glyphs seem to be printed
    non-distorted, just overlapped. The fact that it only happens with inkjets, probably
    has something to do with postscript.\r\n\r\nHave you already tried converting
    the font to outlines, and print again? I know it is not a solution, but it will
    let you know if the error is in the font.\r\n"

  body: I might be wrong, but I wonder if the font which you are trying to print doesn't
    allow printing and so it is defaulting to Adobe Sans. But, I can't explain the
    kerning. Does it look like your font?

  body: I agree with Jelmar that it's an embedding issue, but I'm not sure that it's
    happening because you're running this off on an inkjet (i.e. a Postscript problem).  Which
    version of InD and Acrobat are you using?  I've had problems in the past because
    I didn't have the latest and greatest fixes for both....

  body: "Thanks for the comments. The problems only occur with one of my families.
    If I do just the same with the rest of my typefaces (generating the PDF and printing
    from Acrobat), there is nor problem. \r\nIt is true that the outlines are well
    printes, but it is the spacing that is set to zero. Weird..."

  body: Not sure, but this could be similar to a problem I had with Tyfa PS Smallcaps.
    I have to export out of InDesign as a PS file and then run that through distiller
    for the file to look right.
