body: "Last night I had a new error ,message from FontLab when I tried to save the
  file. It said \" delete several glyphs and try saving again. FontLab cannot save
  more than 64000 glyphs\" I know that can be a problem for some demanding scripts
  but my font only has 824 glyphs!\r\n\r\nI tried saving and saving as and exporting
  and testing as postscrpt but no deal. I eventually calmed myself and opened a new
  blank document. I cut about 240 glyphs from the problem document and pasted them
  into the new blank document and saved it. I was now able to save the problem file.
  I then copied back the discarded glyphs from the new file and pasted them back into
  the old file and saved it. This time it allowed the save! Whaazzzup wit' dat\"?\r\nGoing
  nuts trying to have any confidence in this crazy FL% tool!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Hello Mr Lozos, easiest way is switching the Font Window to Index mode. Cells
    normally show GIDs starting from 0, so the last GID+1 is the total number. Or
    copy \r\n<code>print \"Number of glyphs:\", len(fl.font.glyphs)</code>\r\ninto
    the Macro Editor and run it. Best wishes, Karsten"

  body: "Karsten,\r\nThanks for your help! \r\nBTW, last night I tried using index
    mode before I did my cut and paste thing. It did show a bazillion extra blank
    glyph slots at the end of my real glyphs. I selected them all and tried to delete
    them but it would not allow the delete. It just sat there as if I had nothing
    selected. I can't figure out how all those non glyphs could have been added on
    their own by FontLab and why they only show up in index mode ?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I had this problem once but no idea what went wrong. Maybe the best thing
    then really is to copy \"real\" glyphs, font info, feature and classes into fresh
    font. Maybe Adam has an advice?\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: Chris, I'm familiar with this problem, but I'm still not sure what series
    of actions causes it. I've only ever ended up with half a dozen or so such glyphs,
    never hundreds. What happens is that multiple duplicates of GID 0 (usually the
    .notdef glyph) are created. These are only visible in Index mode. The way to remove
    them is to select and <em>cut</em> the individual glyph that has been duplicated.
    This either removes the duplicates or allows them to be deleted -- I don't remember
    which, it has been a while since I last encountered the problem --, but there
    is a risk of a crash, so it would be a good idea to copy the glyphs you need to
    keep into another VFB if there are changes you have not saved.

  body: PS. If the redundant glyphs are blank, I presume that the /space/ glyph is
    the first in your font, or perhaps your .notdef glyph contains no outline (bad
    idea).
