body: I came accross your site through a google search and thought id join and post
  to see if anyone could help me out. I am currently doing a BA &#40;Hons&#41; in
  Graphic Design and at the moment doing a type and typography project. I have been
  trying to find information about Geoffrey Lee and the design of his font Impact.
  I haven&#39;t yet found much and would be very grateful if anyone has any info they
  could pass on. <BR> <BR>Thanx

  body: I don&#39;t have any info, but I&#39;m curious as to why you chose &#34;Impact.&#34;
    Do you have a special attatchment to the design? It isn&#39;t exactly the &#34;favorite&#34;
    of many posters here. <BR> <BR>Here is what little I know about the font &amp;
    it&#39;s design. <BR>Both the Linotype and Veer website say that the design is
    very similar to Helvetica Inserat. <BR> <BR>MyFonts said that he designed another
    font recently, named Camden &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/geoffreylee/camden/familytree.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/geoffreylee/camden/familytree.html</a>&#41;,
    and that he is now retired. <BR> <BR>He used to work in advertising &#40;also
    from MyFonts, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/lee/geoffrey/y/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/person/lee/geoffrey/y/</a>&#41;,
    and Impact was released by Stephenson Blake. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know what has
    happend to Stephenson Blake. Did anyone buy it? &#40;Monotype Imaging has the
    rights to all of the old typefaces, I think&#41;

    is the first time i have ever worked with type and typography and we had to chose
    6 fonts from a list and trace them, then develop analysing one font in order to
    produce a poster. I chose impact because i&#39;ve thought about doing a simple
    poster with few words on it in large font to get across the message of giving
    &#39;impact&#39;.

  body: many thanks for your reply, mr lee. it&#39;s great to have you here. <BR>
    <BR>you mention  the need for a &#39;home grown product&#39;. but surely, even
    in the 60s, stephenson blake&#39;s catalogue would have been full of british,
    late C19 / early C20 condensed grots, some of them highly condensed. <BR> <BR>were
    these old grots still manufactured by then? or was there a feeling that these
    faces were too out-dated/irregular/inconsistant/&#39;pre-modern&#39; for display/advertising,
    and needed updating? &#40;perhaps, after looking at akzidenz grotesk, haas produced
    helvetica for the same reasons..&#41;  <BR> <BR>how aware, do you think, british
    foundries / type designers in the 60s were of recent continental sans &#40;helvetica,
    univers, folio, eurostyle et al&#41;... i would be very interested to hear your
    perspective on this. i suppose the context eludes me...please forgive the questions.
    <BR> <BR>by the way, please feel free to post your pdf on this forum. &#40;this
    can be done by clicking on &#39;upload attachment&#39;, and following the instructions&#41;.
    otherwise, i&#39;d be grateful if you could cc me a copy at geraintfranklin_at_yahoo_dot_co_dot_uk
