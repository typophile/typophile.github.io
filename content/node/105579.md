  body: "The image seems to be from one of the original posters for the movie, which
    was released in 1984.\r\nI suspect it is lettering adapted from a monoline slab
    serif font such as Rockford.  The oversize bowl on the R and the ski jump leg
    could have been added to evoke a nostalgic retro/deco mood.\r\nAt least I have
    not seen the combination in a digital or pre-digital monoline slab serif font.\r\nThere
    is at least one digital font inspired by Rockford that has a ski jump leg on the
    R similar to the lettering:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1984LetteringAndSanchezSlabWithAltR_3715.jpg]\r\nThe
    lettering is in red and the font in black.\r\nIt's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/sanchez-slab/\">Sanchez
    Slab</a>, using the alt R.\r\nDon"

      good point about the nostalgic touch on the R.\r\n\r\nThis being from the pre-digital
      age, I applaud whoever put all that work into doing a one-off."

  body: Following Don's suggestion of Sanchez, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/trend|Trend]]
    Slab, coming from the same foundry Latinotype, could also be an interesting substitute.
    X-height looks closer to your original sample, only needs /R leg to be tweaked.
