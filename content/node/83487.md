  Type1 fonts... now I'm on OSX and need to migrate my typefaces, but not all are
  enjoying the experience. Helvetica Neue, which I bought from Adobe back in the early
  1990's as part of a typeface collection, keeps disappearing. Fontbook is of no help,
  and Adobe has not answered my emails about a cheap upgrade(? I can't afford the
  $961 for the same font in a new format, thanks Adobe). \r\n\r\nI still have the
  original Adobe CD, but i guess they don't care. Has anyone here ever successfully
  talked Adobe into a format upgrade without shelling out a stack of cash?"

  body: Postscript Type 1 font support is built into OS X - I would try reinstalling
    your font form the CD, it may be corrupt. You should be able to just install by
    double clicking

    Neue conflicts with the version Apple supplies (which is a .dfont and can't be
    gotten rid of). I ended up buying the weights of Helvetica Neue that I needed
    in OTF from Linotype.\r\n\r\nHelvetica Neue was the only type 1 font I've ever
    had an issue with."

  body: 'If the fonts are called the same, then they clash. The obvious solution is
    to rename the font, say call it "Helvetica Neue Type1" instead of "Helvetica Neue".
    It is less expensive than buying a font called "Helvetica Neue Std" or anything
    else if you don''t need it. '

    the info re HelveticaNeue you need is there. \r\n\r\nAs to converting to other
    font formats: in al lot of cases this is not necessary.\r\n\r\nOn another note:
    OS X does NOT like font suitcases with multiple files in them (family styles,
    combinations of different cuts, etc.). These need to be smashed into separate
    files (eg using Smasher, or on an old computer with OS 9 and a Font/DA-Mover-like
    application"
