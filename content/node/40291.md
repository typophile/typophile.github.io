    the letters have been tweaked a bit. '

  body: michel, that probably isn't a first-generation logo file, so it might not
    be best to try and judge the fidelity of the curves using that S. it looks like
    the postscript has been optimized and re-optimized several times.

    characters have bad curves is more than 30 times larger than the one with clean
    curves? (1126931 bytes against 36487 bytes)."
