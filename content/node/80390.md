body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nFor an ecommerce webproject, I am in need of a font for body
  text that combines well with the Tartine Script Black that is used for the type
  logo. \r\n\r\nCurrently the website uses Arial, which in a way makes sense, but
  I am looking for something (web-safe) slightly less boring than that. I have looked
  around but could not find anything suitable. hence the question here, boiling down
  to:\r\n\r\nWhat font combines well with Tartine Script Black?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nAnthonie"

    seem to be a good idea setting the body text in serif. Thanks for the suggestion,

    take ten minutes to download on a link with a ten-megabit bottleneck.'
