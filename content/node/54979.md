  Atlas is the title of the project I am working on for my senior show. It is, in
  summary, a luxury airline. To create a strong brand I decided to craft a custom
  typeface. \r\n\r\nI wanted the type to have two lives, so to speak. One as a display
  face where its 'diamondy' edges, irregular curves and ink wells shine. The other
  as a text face where all those elements become less prominent.\r\n\r\nThe type is
  at a point now where I need to fix some of the quirks that are not working and refine
  any flaws. I would greatly appreciate if you could take a look and tell me what
  you think. Any and all feedback is welcome.  \r\n\r\nTo start things off I've attached
  the alphabet.\r\n\r\nThank-You \r\n\r\n-Ian   "

    and overly bumpy. The face is essentially monoline, but then it has these odd
    joins where it tapers down to next to nothing. \r\n\r\nEither you could introduce
    more humanist traits into the face, to give the tapers a reason to be, or you
    could lessen their extreme lightness and bring back the monoline nature. As it
    stands now, I don't think it works. "

  body: "Thanks for the comment Steve, perhaps they do taper too much. I'll play with
    that. But as mentioned in the intro that was my intention. Its kitchy, if not
    distracting, yes \u2014 But that's when its at display size. In body copy those
    ink traps disappear and dazzle. \r\n\r\nI can see now that the tapers may be on
    the cusp of being too thin. What do others think?\r\n\r\nThanks again, \r\n-Ian "

  body: "I applaud your ambitious project! The \"ink trap\" feature seems ok but problematic
    in execution as SJP mentions. The faceted edges are not saying luxury to me on
    any level. You say they look kitch in display. Where do kitch and luxury airline
    intersect? \r\n\r\nTake a look at the *free* and excellent Kontrapunkt typeface.
    It comes from the same genus as your idea:\r\nhttp://www.kontrapunkt.dk/news/ddprize_typeface_of_the_year_2004\r\n\r\nMy
    advice would be to remove the faceting. Then you can really focus on the shapes
    and we can give further crit. An interesting start. I look forward to seeing this
    used in the program. Can you show us that? Would help us get a feel for the design
    language of the ID system."

  body: "Yeah that has amazing elements, its looks as though my type is the bastard
    child of Museo, Kontrapunkt and Breuer Text! Maybe I should just hang up my shoes
    and use Kontrapunkt. \r\n\r\nI suppose kitch was the wrong word as yes, kitch
    has nothing to do with luxury airline. I suppose i was looking more for \"quirk,\"
    such as the prada R & A. I was hoping that the quirk, awful or not, would be memorable
    \u2014 preferably in a good way. Perhaps those elements are only best explored
    in the logotype, which I am exploring in creating a fat face for. I will post
    those tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI am drawn to my odd faceted edges but; should I: a.) emphasize
    them or b.) as Randy Mentions remove them. Right now it is definitely in between.
    \ \r\n\r\nThanks so much everyone, I really appreciate the crit so far. "

  body: "Ian let me suggest this: \r\n\r\nFocus on the logo and the identity. Get
    that perfect and then use your *extra time* (haha) to worry about the font. AND
    EVEN THEN I would only worry about a single display weight to work with an existing
    typeface for text. That would be an ambitious,but manageable student project IMO.\r\n\r\nThoughts
    to guide your design of the logo:\r\nBe clear about the position of your new airline
    brand. You say luxury. Luxury how and for whom? Is this a \"luxury\" experience
    for the budget conscious - eg JetBlue vs Southwest or \"luxury\" for the well-healed
    international business traveler - eg Emirates / Singapore \"now with private suites.\"
    Have you created a brief, and if so, what is it?\r\n\r\nGood luck and show us
    a logo!"

  body: "One immediate thought I had was to treble the weight  but keep the size of
    the ink traps the same, so there is justification for them. Then work backwards
    from a bold/black weight toward a lighter version. This might help some of the
    \"kitch\" disappear and become \"refined character\"\r\n\r\nOne thing that the
    Prada R has going for it, is the weight (not to mention some serious [brand] equity)\r\n\r\nI
    also second the comments Randy made. Tighten up a brief, and get a logo up first."

  body: "Randy and Arlo, Awesome advice... here is my project proposal - in bullet
    form. \r\n\r\nProblem\r\nRoyal Atlas is an up and coming airline & lifestyle carrier
    that wants to \u2018spread its wings\u2019 and become an equitable brand / company.
    It caters specifically to \u2018events\u2019 and wishes to make the experience
    of traveling a beneficially and enriching experience. \r\n\r\nQuestion\r\nHow
    do you structure / design an interface to build a strong loyal clientele and an
    efficiently run airline, while maintaining a lifestyle brand with strong brand
    equity.  What sets this airline apart from others?\r\n\r\nAnswer / Proposal\r\nAs
    technology is no replacement for the actual experience of travel it will be used
    extensively to supplement the planning and sharing of destinations.  In addition
    the layout of the plane will create community. \r\n\u2013\tDestinations cater
    to specific events\r\n\u2013\tTravel Buddies \u2013 Groups (Companies can charter
    this service with other companies.)\r\n\u2013\tSponsored Events\r\no\tUser created
    coverage\r\n\u2022\tTwitter feed page\r\n\u2022\tLive update photos & maps\r\n\u2022\tiPhone
    community \u2013 trip specific recommendations ,\u2018loopt\u2019 like meeting
    opportunities. \r\n\u2013\tBranded user created content\r\no\tPhoto Albums (Printed)
    \u2013 made by user\r\no\tTravel site w/ map & photos for friends and family (or
    for all)\r\no\tUser Swag\r\n\u2013\tCreate Printed ads that advertise the style
    and ideas of the\r\n brand \u201CMaking Google Maps better\u201D ??\r\n\u2013\tInterior
    Design of the plane to allow for conversations, (instead of all people in rows
    facing forward toward the destination, people will be grouped at \u2018tables\u2019
    or in circles to induce conversation and sharing)\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nThe nice thing
    about traveling in a group & a digital community is that it allows you to use
    it to better your experience, whether you are \u2018social\u2019 or not.\r\n\r\nTechnology
    allows you to hide & be anonymous or network & be seen / heard. Either way the
    tools supplied at a personal level by the airline supplement the experience and
    can be utilized by professionals for personal gain. \r\n\r\nThe goal of Royal
    Atlas is to create a community to share travel experiences and aid in networking.\r\n"

  body: "Logo time? Yes! \r\n\r\nSimple explanation of the logo: \r\n-Globe - as it
    relates to 'atlas'\r\n-Compass - as it relates to traveling\r\n-Diamond - as it
    is 'royal'\r\n-Circle - as this is how people will be seated\r\n-Colored Triangles
    - as many people will be sharing their voices creating conversation.\r\n\r\nI
    also took Arlo's advice and made a bold face (well just the logotype so far.)
    \ It had crossed my mind that such thin type would disappear on the side of a
    plane. Bold just seems to be par for the course.  \r\n\r\nSo there will be accents
    of these really bright colours, as seen in the logo. But for the most part the
    identity will rely heavily on Black, White, Gray, and Silver with these colors
    as accents. These colors are based off of some of the colours I've been seeing
    come down the Spring 2009 Runways. \r\n\r\nAlso I plan on making the logo dynamic,
    the colors can shift fade in and out. Also they can relate to the separate features
    of my website (to be) and will help navigate. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.umlaut-design.com/RoyalAtlas_Typophile_BoldTypeandLogo.jpg|Royal

  body: "After reading the brief, it seems to be more focused on marketing materials
    than on visual strategy.\r\n\r\nI would ask a few questions about where you want
    the visual direction to go.\r\n1. what adjectives do you want people to describe
    the company as? (fun or serious, inclusive or exclusive, cold or warm, business
    or casual, etc.) [Randy touched a little on this idea]\r\n2. What visual elements
    support the adjectives you selected?\r\n3. what other brands would consumers of
    this brand be likely to subscribe to? what visual language works for these brands?
    Do you want your visual language to be similar/dissimilar? (Be wary that answers
    to this question can easily cross the line toward plagiarism.)\r\n4. Identify
    the demographic more specifically. In addition to the online users, what are their
    spending habits, income level, hobbies, gender, ethnicity, careers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe
    answers to these questions give a more specific framework and it becomes much
    easier to develop a visual direction that can then be applied to the marketing
    materials you outlined in the brief.\r\n\r\nThink general to specific. If you
    outline objectives and strategy before you start executing, you'll end up with
    more appropriate work. Freedom within boundaries.\r\n\r\nAs far as the logo you
    have now, it feels much more casual and conversational than luxury; more geared
    to a predominantly female audience, which may or may not be the demographic you
    are after.\r\n\r\nHopefully this is helpful. P.S. I realize this is a student
    project, but it's always good to build the foundation before building the house
    on it. Best of luck."
