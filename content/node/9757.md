  body: 'It&#39;s gonna be tough to get a straight answer out of people about this
    one. Categorizing fonts is one of those things that seems to attract an inordinate
    amount of attention, for results of questionable utility, and everyone seems to
    think everyone else&#39;s scheme is bogus. <BR> <BR>I think creating any kind
    of taxonomic tree for type is a heroic and ultimately futile task. Likewise, categorizing
    type strictly according to a timeline loses a lot of nuance as well. The back
    end of Routledge&#39;s Classic International Typefinder talks about some British
    type classification standard that has lots of descriptors that look like 1.4.23.18.4.87:
    a scheme only an old-style reference librarian could love. <BR> <BR>Categorizing
    type reminds me a lot of the problems I face in categorizing my music collection:
    a lot of stuff just doesn&#39;t fit well into a single category. I like the way
    MyFonts does it, although they could probably stand to be a little more comprehensive,
    rigorous, and otherwise more ontologically coherent: every font has one or more
    keywords and categories to describe it. Deciding upon the set of potential keywords
    is the next hard problem, but that&#39;s an exercise for the reader. <BR> <BR>As
    far as how many categories there are: how many typefaces are there?'

    With any morphological system, there are so many grey areas, that, beyond &#34;Sans,

    not to say that I don&#39;t mentally consider and sort typefaces according to

    a highly informed, refined form of mental processing, beyond words. Known as design.

    sans serif typefaces &#40;as in, &#34;Oh great, another humanist sans&#34;&#41;,
    it refers to typefaces devised with an emphasis on legibility and gently modulated
    stroke widths derived from calligraphy. I think the archetypal humanist sans is
    Optima, but these days its contrast seems somewhat extreme. <BR> <BR>&#34;Neo-Grotesque&#34;
    is easier: neo-grotesques are the line of sans serif typefaces that owe their
    ultimate derivation from Akzidenz Grotesk and the other &#34;commercial&#34; sans
    serif typefaces from the turn of the 20th Century: rational, legible forms, low
    contrast, consistent stroke widths &#40;although neo-grotesques aren&#39;t generally
    monoline&#41;, a strong vertical emphasis. Helvetica and Univers are the definitive
    neo-grotesques.'

  body: 'If you want a system of classification to help you think about type, then
    you need to figure out <i>how</i> you want to think about type. Classification
    systems, as Borges&#39; classification of animals taught us, are arbitrary categorisations
    that reflect the priorities of the people who make them. Which is not to say that
    they are useless, but that they are useful only to people with a shared set of
    priorities or the same way of thinking about the classified subject. In some scientific
    fields, there are practical benefits to practitioners adopting the same system
    of classification, so that they can understand each others&#39; work. But when
    a system of classification ceases to be an aid to thinking about a subject and
    becomes, instead, a means of forcing people to think in a particular way or, as
    in the case of some type classification systems, an esoteric means of excluding
    outsiders, then I think you have a problem. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think there is
    anything critical enough in typography that compels us to all use the same classification
    system: if there were, we would have come to an agreement a long time ago, just
    as biologists &#40;largely&#41; have. I tend to avoid classifying type, on the
    basis that every design is its own category: what makes us interested in a particular
    typeface is the way in which it differs from all other typefaces, not the way
    in which it belongs to a class of similar typefaces. If I classify type at all,
    I tend to employ &#40;western&#41; art historical classifications -- e.g. renaissance,
    mannerist, baroque, rococo, neo-classical, romantic, Victorian, neo-gothic, early
    modernist, international modernist, etc. -- because I like to think about type
    design in the larger cultural context in which it happens and of which it is a
    part. The specialised terminology of many typeface classification systems -- transitional,
    Didone, Garald, neo grotesk, etc. -- cut type design off from its cultural context,
    and present type as an esoteric field of specialised knowledge to which outsiders
    can only gain access with difficulty. A reasonably educated person has some notion
    of what romantic music sounds like, what romantic poetry entails, what a romantic
    painting looks like, and in what period these things were made. Why shouldn&#39;t
    he also know what a romantic typeface, of the same period and cultural milieu,
    looks like and be able to identify such? [Indeed, I think our whole understanding
    of what constitutes e.g. romanticism is subtlty altered depending on whether we
    include or exclude type design, just as it would be if we arbitrarily excluded
    choral music or landscape painting. By including type design in our consideration
    of the cultural context in which it is produced, we not only make sense of type
    design, but also change our understanding of that context.] <BR> <BR>Of course,
    I fully admit that the art historical classification of type breaks down as the
    20th century progresses, and the catch-all &#39;post-modernist&#39; category is
    very inadequate to talk meaningfully about a large body of recent work. This probably
    says as much about post-modernism as a cultural phenomenon as it does about the
    value of the classification system. But all classification systems fail eventually:
    the key is to understand their limits and make use of them insofar as they are
    useful, and no further. As our culture fragments further, classification systems
    based on cultural criteria will be less and less useful to the discussion of new
    works, but as a means of understanding the cultural artifacts of the past, including
    type design, they will remain useful. <BR> <BR>But maybe you don&#39;t want to
    think about type in terms of cultural context. So the first question must always
    be &#39;How do you want to think about type?&#39;, and then you either look around
    for an existing classification system that assists your thinking, or you invent
    your own. <BR> <BR>David Mundie&#39;s wonderful <a href="http://www.anthus.com/Typography/Faces.html">Field
    Guide to the Faces</a> is worth taking a look at, by the way. It isn&#39;t really
    a classification system, per se,, although it results in one. It combines the
    principles of botanical taxonomy with dewey decimal cataloguing, as a means of
    identifying typefaces in the wild.'

  body: 'I agree with everything John says, and I want to emphasize that systems of
    classification are also systems of thought. <BR> <BR>Most of us inherit our basic
    notions of taxonomy or classification from our high school biology classes, where
    species slot neatly into the gigantic Linnaean tree of species, genera, phyla,
    families, and kingdoms, and you can unambiguously differentiate and classify individual
    organisms based on morphological characteristics via field guides or binomial
    keys. <BR> <BR>The thing is, in certain areas of biology, this system causes more
    problems than it solves. My mother&#39;s a mycologist, and it turns out that genetic
    analysis is a much more reliable indicator of what constitutes a species than
    looking at characteristics visible to the naked eye. The vast majority of mushrooms
    are small, brown and slimy, and telling them apart without a microscope is often
    impossible. The problem is that identification via genetic markers takes the painstakingly-built,
    orderly &#34;traditional&#34; species tree, and replaces it with a messy network
    of organisms, where the size, color, and shape of a fungus is not necessarily
    a reliable indicator of its relationship to other fungi. As a result, amateur
    mycologists &#40;who are generally observant, fussy, and in possession of a ton
    of hands-on field experience&#41; get into passionate and sometimes vitriolic
    arguments with professional mycologists over what species something is all the
    time. Their classification systems are colliding, and the amateurs get frustrated
    that their common-sense notions of how to identify mushrooms are being refuted
    by something that doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to them. That doesn&#39;t mean
    professional mycologists are condescending eggheads &#40;well, it doesn&#39;t
    mean they&#39;re &#42;necessarily&#42; condescending eggheads&#41;, they&#39;re
    just facing the problem at a different level. <BR> <BR>The problem for typographers
    is the same one facing any other technical practitioner: we need some way of talking
    to each other about what we&#39;re doing. All classification systems are essentially
    arbitrary at their roots; typography has a 500&#43;-year history in the West,
    and is a history of tiny tweaks to familiar forms. Classification is a form of
    shorthand. It&#39;s what allows a working designer or typographer to say, &#34;I&#39;m
    redesigning a newsletter and I need a good humanist sans for captions&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>The existing system of type classification &#40;i.e. the one we all use here
    from day to day&#41; is a mess, but it does have the advantage of being shared.
    John, there&#39;s a lot of value in tying type to its cultural context, but historical
    schemes get increasingly sketchy the closer you get to the present day. Also,
    at that point you&#39;re off-loading the problem of categorization and classification
    to the art / culture critics who name artistic movements, often long after the
    fact. Basically everything that happened after about 1940 is either &#34;modernist&#34;
    or &#34;postmodernist&#34;, and that covers a huge range of innovation in type.
    Not to mention that the only working definition of post-modernist type I&#39;ve
    ever been able to come up with is, &#34;stuff that appeared in Fuse or Emigre&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>That said, it seems like most of the time we work mostly by analogy:
    &#34;I want a sans that goes well with Trajan. I already looked at Optima, TheSans,
    and Officina Sans and they&#39;re all too plain.&#34;'

  body: 'Forrest: I found your mushroom analogy interesting. Would it also be fair
    to say that the vast majority of fonts are small, brown, and slimy? <BR> <BR>To
    continue your analogy, the concept of species makes <i>sense</i> for organisms.
    In most cases, analyzing the DNA gives you a definitive answer. Perhaps a different
    answer than an amateur mycologist would get get by looking at the color and shape,
    but an answer nonetheless. <BR> <BR>I think fonts want to be grouped into classifications
    because they&#39;re all copied from other fonts. I like terms such as &#34;garalde&#34;
    &#40;meaning copied from Garamond and Aldus&#41; because they capture this truth.
    <BR> <BR>The problem is that you choose a dozen or so seminal fonts, from which
    a plurality or even majority of other fonts are copied, but that inevitably leaves
    out a significant minority. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any good hierarchical
    solution to this problem. <BR> <BR>I suggest naming the fonts that served as inspiration.
    To me, <a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/thesans/sans-.html">TheSans</a>
    is Frutiger with Eras-y curves and a two-story &#39;g&#39;. <a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/spiegel/spiegel-.html">Spiegel</a>
    is clearly Franklin Gothic with the trademark Luc&#40;as&#41; curve treatment.
    The curves and the underlying letter architecture contribute equally to the distinctive
    character of the font, but in any classification scheme you&#39;d be forced to
    choose one as the primary defining characteristic. <BR> <BR>I get the feeling
    that the tendency to find generic classification terms comes largely from a reluctance
    to acknowledge the sources for a font design, and a general touchiness about trademarks.
    Consider, for example, the fact that almost all of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/bitstream/">Bitstream</a>&#39;s
    early catalog was copies of popular typefaces, with the name filed off and replaced
    by a generic classification term such as &#34;Swiss&#34; or &#34;Aldine&#34;,
    with a 3 digit number added to make it all sound much more systematic. Even so,
    there are plenty of questionably categorized fonts: would you call <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-415/">Metro</a>
    a Geometric? <BR> <BR>Gotham is a larger x-height Avenir, which is Futura by the
    hand of Frutiger. Calling it a &#34;Geometric Sans&#34; loses specificity, but
    on the other hand avoids the possibility of running into trademark problems.'

  body: Raph, I think you&#39;re muddying the waters a bit in your analysis.  <BR>
    <BR>Copying popular fonts and giving them a different name is a practice that
    was common in the days when fonts were tied to a particular manufacturer&#39;s
    equipment. Bitstream was a pioneer in creating a digital type library at a time
    when this was still the norm. Bitstream was formed by former Linotype people &#40;including
    Matthew Carter&#41; who were well aware of what they were doing. They licensed
    the name when they could, and when they couldn&#39;t, they used a generic name.
    The name was really the only thing that could be protected at the time. They also
    worked with the original designers in many cases, even when they couldn&#39;t
    use the name. You make it sound like they copied existing digital fonts and simply
    renamed them. <BR> <BR>Now that fonts are distributed in &#40;more or less&#41;
    universal formats, not tied to any particular manufacturer&#39;s equipment, the
    need for this behavior has disappeared and the practice is much less acceptable.
    You&#39;ll notice that when Agfa Monotype yanked the license to distribute ITC
    fonts from Bitstream, Bitstream removed them from their library, even though they
    could conceivably have just renamed them. <BR> <BR>Creating a new font based either
    closely or loosely on some other font is a different thing. Sometimes the similarity
    of two fonts is intentional, sometimes not. If you design a font in the Humanist
    style, you may well end up with something that looks like Gill or Frutiger. This
    can come from following the &#34;rules&#34; that constitute a Humanist type design
    as easily as consciously imitating an existing face. <BR> <BR>When I designed
    Proxima Sans in the early nineties, my intention was to create a hybrid between
    grotesques like Helvetica and Franklin Gothic and geometric sans faces like Futura.
    At the time I worked out the basic design, I was not familiar with Avenir, even
    though it had been released a few years earlier. I nearly stopped working on Proxima
    Sans when I became aware of Avenir and noticed the similarities. In the end, I
    decided that the differences were substantial enough and finished the fonts. <BR>
    <BR>In the same vein, I was surprised when Gotham was released at its similarities
    with Proxima Sans. However, I <b>would not</b> accuse them of copying Proxima
    Sans &#40;or Avenir&#41;. I think it&#39;s simply a matter of having design goals
    which result in a similar solution.  <BR> <BR>This is not to say that type designers
    do not look at how other type designers have solved the same or similar problems.
    They do. But to say that Font A is just Font B with a different x-height &#40;or

    seriously, the assertion that <i>all</i> fonts are copies of other fonts is an
    overstatement. But I think it is important to acknowledge the strong influences
    from fonts that have gone before. I did <i>not</i> mean to trivialize the process

  body: 'Thanks for the the feedback by the way. This thread has exceeded the informaton
    which I wanted, but has led to other questions that I need to be asking myself
    about type. <BR> <BR>I am studying graphic design and I have become interested
    in typography and type design. I started this thread because I wanted to understand  font
    classification that exists. After stumbling on this site I have been introduced
    to an emourmous number of new typefaces and I would like to ask you another question:
    <BR> <BR>I respect the fact that many of you are type designers who make a living
    from creating new typefaces. But is creating &#34;Font B with a different x-height&#34;
    of any use to me as someone solving visual communication problems? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    heard of designers using only 8 typefaces throughout their entire career. Personaly
    I believe that each job requires the right font for it to communicate propperly
    and this requires a much wider range of typefaces.  <BR> <BR>However, the more
    I am exploring type design the more I am finding very similar designs which I
    believe I will never use. You could argue that such an overwealming number of
    typefaces is overcomplicating the design process.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t mean to
    offend anyone here but I am trying establish whether I &#40;as a graphic designer
    not a type designer&#41; I should be spending time looking at typefaces which
    are identicle in the eyes of our target audience, the public.'

    aesthetic reasons.  <BR> <BR>For example,one designer, Matthew Carter, has designed
    Bell Centennial, for phone books, Verdana, for computer screens and &#39;Postoni&#39;,
    a headline face for the Washington Post Newspaper. Use any one of these for the
    other purpose, and the result will be much inferior.  <BR> <BR>Aesthetically,
    such faces as Caslon and Zapfino will give very different impressions.  <BR> <BR>No
    doubt it is valuable to learn to use a few typefaces well. But the availablity
    of a variety for different puposes and moods represents an opportunity. Knowing
    a broader pallette and how to use it must be an advantage. However, typefaces
    are only one ingredient in graphic design, so obviously you have to budget how
    much time you want to put in on this one ingredient.

  body: 'Barbedor doesn&#39;t really look that much like Lydian &#40;or Stahl, Rudolf
    Koch&#39;s also unjustly-neglected take on calligraphic, humanist sans, which
    is currently only available via <a href="http://www.romana-hamburg.de/">Gerhard
    Helzel</a>&#41;. It looks more like a vertical take on cursive or italic forms,
    a chancery-influenced semi-serifed script. I agree, it&#39;s beautiful. <BR> <BR>After
    reading <a href="http://www.stbride.org/conference2002/TypefaceClassification.html">Catherine
    Dixon&#39;s essay</a> on typeface classification, I&#39;d say the classification
    scheme she proposes is a concrete implementation of my own  more inchoate ramblings.
    It combines sources &#40;i.e. history&#41; with formal attributes, and explicitly
    includes the notion of an unbounded list of type &#34;patterns&#34; &#40;e.g.
    &#34;textura&#34; or &#34;garalde&#34;&#41; that are themselves combinations of
    sources and formal attributes. I personally like this as it reminds me of one
    of my favorite patterns of object-oriented software development: creation of new
    objects through the cloning of prototypes. <BR> <BR>Raph, to return to mycology
    for a moment, the problem with DNA-based identification is that genetic analysis
    is still &#40;and probably always be&#41; an inexact way to discuss the origins
    and derivation of species. While we can learn a lot about where mushrooms come
    from by analyzing their genes, things like parallel and convergent evolution make
    it very difficult to build a comprehensive picture of the history of fungi from
    their genes alone. DNA will reliably give us the identity of an individual organism,
    but each step you take way from establishing identity gets you into ever-more-dubious
    waters. <BR> <BR>The analogy to type is clear: especially in this, the High Era
    of the Humanist Sans, design constraints are going to result in the persistent
    reinvention and reuse of seemingly distinctive design features, and the intersection
    of craft and commerce means that people are still going to have to defend themselves
    from claims of plagiarism and uncredited influence &#40;which are often properly
    made, but also often not: I honestly think the Today / Cronos kerfuffle of a few
    years ago is a good example of where this may be undecidable to outside observers&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>So yes, most fonts are small, brown, and slimy, and a classification
    system like Catherine Dixon&#39;s is never going to definitively affix a typeface
    in its proper place in history. It might, however, allow all of us to have a more
    meaningful conversation about our tools and our craft, which has a lot of value.
    I&#39;d love to see her scheme adopted as a standard. <BR> <BR>Marc, it&#39;s
    entirely possible for a designer to build their career upon a very short list
    of typefaces. Jan Tschichold managed to reduce his list to one item near the end
    of his career, believing there was no problem in book design his own typeface
    Sabon couldn&#39;t solve. Derek Birdsall has gotten a lot of mileage out of Gill
    Sans, Van Dijck, Poliphilus, and Blado. For a long time Neville Brody used his
    own display typefaces almost exclusively. <BR> <BR>However, if you start browsing
    the Web for designers&#39; lists of &#34;essential typefaces&#34;, you&#39;ll
    quickly realize there&#39;s a disturbing lack of consistency among them. Typefaces,
    as products of premeditated acts of creation, inescapably have their own personalities,
    and different people will respond to different personalities. I personally think
    Gill Sans, Clarendon, American Uncial, and Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch are typefaces
    all designers should have available to them &#40;among others&#41;, but I don&#39;t
    expect many other designers to share this conviction. Obsessively prowling through
    specimen books or font websites can be a distraction and cloud designers&#39;
    minds when they should be working on other things, but it can also be its own
    reward. The best way to learn about type is to play with it and work with it,
    and if you just take somebody else&#39;s recommendations on faith, you&#39;ll
    miss a lot of opportunities for creative design.'

    the point that type designers are always trying to create new typefaces to &#34;fill
    in the gaps&#34;. They are also trying to invent new gaps to fill in. <BR> <BR>So
    part of the reason for classification systems to exist &#40;in whatever form,
    even without words, inside typographer&#39;s heads&#41; is to stimulate new type
    designs, and then to help understand how they fit in with what&#39;s gone before.
    <BR> <BR>Regarding the &#34;over&#34; abundance: you can&#39;t have a few good
    new successful designs without a lot that fall by the wayside. &#40;some of which,
    undeservedly so&#41;. The strange thing about digital media is that the warehouse
    and the museum are the same thing: the stuff that never sells is not melted down
    and the materials recycled, it remains on the catalog -- hence the gazillions
    of fonts to confound the neophyte. I once took a face of mine that didn&#39;t

  body: 'The only problem I have with systems is when they become ends rather than
    means. I&#39;m interested by attempts to systematically classify type because
    those attempts provide me with prepackaged perspectives on what type is, how it
    is to be used, and how it ought to be designed. There is no system for categorizing
    knowledge that is ultimately successful in all situations, or else the Library
    of Congress would be using the Dewey Decimal System. We all have to take in these
    systems, evaluate them, and make what use of them we can. <BR> <BR>I think one
    of the most important uses of classification schemes is communication. I know
    very little about type next to a lot of the people on these boards, but I know
    enough to notice that whenever we try to discuss or compare type designs, we&#39;re
    forced to grasp for terms, to haltingly try to synchronize our differing vocabularies.
    It would be nice if there were a common jargon we could use that was both precise
    and ambiguous enough to encompass the rule-based but essentially amorphous creative
    enterprise of type design. I don&#39;t want to be stuck with prescriptive gobbledygook,
    but it seems to me we can do better than we have. And if we can discuss things
    with each other more intelligibly, the odds are good we&#39;ll be able to think
    about them more clearly too. <BR> <BR>It would be neat to see a wiki built up
    around Cynthia Dixon&#39;s type classification scheme; I think the inhabitants
    of Typophile could collectively populate one with enough information to be useful
    relatively quickly. At the same time, any categorization scheme that tries to
    finally and ultimately nail down the category or type of a typeface &#40;in other
    words, to completely remove ambiguity&#41; is doomed to failure: again, type design
    is a field of tiny changes to very familiar forms, and attempting to objectively
    nail things down is likely to shed more heat than light. We spend too much time

    a top serif that goes straight up and down, and whether that serif ascends at

    Which serif fonts do have certain attributes for a given upper or lower case character,
    and which do not.\r\n\r\nI think that some kind of a format whereby individual
    characters within a font could be compared to each other quickly and easily, that
    would help a lot!\r\n\r\nIf we knew, for example, the x-height proportions of
    any given font, that would help a lot!\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I am really
