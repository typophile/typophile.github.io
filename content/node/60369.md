  body: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didot_(typeface)">Didot</a> is not a
    sans serif typeface, so the name "sans serif didot" doesn't make sense.

  body: "i know that didot is a serif font. the font that appears in Man About Town
    is a sans-serif version. the serifs are loped off. \r\ni was hoping to see if
    there's a version out there. i don't want to make it myself. \r\n\r\n"

  body: And yet the image you posted has serif fonts... Even the word "PARIS," at
    the very top, which has characters with wildly varying stroke widths, has serifs.

  body: here's a better example. the top version is the one i created by removing
    the serifs. the bottom version is didot bold. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TYPE-SAMPLE_4633.gif]

  body: "that was a bad image and an even worse description. any idea of what this
    can be? \r\ncheck out www.manabouttownonline.com. they use it on every spread.
    maybe they did it all by hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: OK, I see now... Only certain serifs were removed (it was harder to see in
    the first image due to the soft focus). Those triangular shapes at the ends of
    S, E, and F are serifs, too. It might be more accurate to call this a semi-serif
    face, in the style of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/agfa-rotis-semi-serif/">Rotis</a>.

  body: According to <a href="http://magculture.com/blog/?p=1219">magCulture</a>,
    <em>Man About Town</em> is designed by <a href="http://www.saturday-london.com/">Saturday</a>,
    a London agency. Now I'm positive that it's a customized face.
