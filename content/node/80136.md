body: "Care to critique these lowercase forms? Still working on the /y/, but I'd like
  some input on the rhythm so far and how it can be improved. Not too happy with that
  /s/, though. I just saw Sudtipo's newly released [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/fiance/|Fianc\xE9]]
  which has the same soft-ness I'm going for. It has what I call a baby s...maybe
  I'll take cues from that."

  body: "I like it a lot. It's very friendly. I especially like the g and the w.\r\n\r\nThe
    s looks light in the middle. I hate trying to do 's's in fat fonts, but I think
    it's better to take bulk off of the terminals, rather than the middle.\r\n\r\nYou
    have some general x-height correction to do. When I look really closely, even
    the x and z don't seem to match, and look at 'ese.'\r\n\r\nThe upper right arm
    of the x looks thinner than the others. It's not that noticeable, but the crossing
    of it could use some optical correction too.\r\n\r\nThat's all I can see right
    now :)"

  body: I think you could just shorten the negative spaces of 's', so as to thicken
    the verticals and relax the slope of the center.

  body: 'beautiful. reminds me of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/teaspoon/|teaspoon]],
    and I mean that in a good way. Love the contrast of the roundness with the sharp
    inside angles. '

  body: If you want it still cuddlier you could try a curvier treatment of the rightmost
    strokes of /v/ and /w/. And maybe leg of /k/?

  body: That's looking lovely. I agree witgh eliason, that you might experiment a
    bit more with the v, w and k, to bring that curvy character into them. I also
    think the s can use some work, and the z could use a bit more conrast between
    the horizontals and the diagonal. Perhaps the hook of the f could use a slightly
    more pointy terminal? I.e. like the bottom of the j, but not as much.

    d, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, u, v, w, x & z seems too generic.\r\n\r\n"
