  an invitation for a Real estate Company for prospective sellers offering a free
  market appraisal or house valuation. The company in question is very well established
  (over 200 years) and a bit posh.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a nice script font which
  is traditional and a bit posh without being old-fashioned or screaming wedding (Edwardian
  Script, Balmoral). Legibility is very important and I would prefer if the caps wernt
  too fancy.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions much appreciated"
