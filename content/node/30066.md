  the license was never used, is it still possible to request the fonts you get when
  you register? When I installed the software, it said that I could request Poppl-Laudatio
  Condensed and Apollo, both very nice faces, for the unbelievable price of $0.00!\r\n\r\nI
  can't seem to be able to get anyone on the line at Adobe, but I should be able to
  request the fonts, right?"

  body: Type On Call, FWIR, was Adobe's version of ordering from a catalogue. When
    I used it, a gazillion years ago, you had to pay for a key to unlock the fonts.
    Are you saying that your employer's paid for an unlocked CD and they never used
    it?

    with it will have expired. Same thing applied to the v.6 Type On Call I found
    in secondhand bookstore.\r\n\r\nBTW, have you seen any examples of Apollo in use
    anywhere?"

  body: "I have no idea what it's all about. I think you buy the \"catalogue,\" then
    call to purchase individual typefaces after you select them. When you registered,
    you got a chance to call in and activate a selection of a few typefaces on the
    cd for free.\r\n\r\nSince it was never used, I suppose that the chance to activate
    the complementary fonts is still valid."
