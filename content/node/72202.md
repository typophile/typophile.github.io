  \r\nI'm a software developer and i was going to add some programs to my portfolio,
  but the time pass, my laptop was stolen and... I don't have the original image.\r\n\r\nI
  made that with The Gimp and the font that I don't know what's the name :( if someone
  have any idea I'll really appreciate any help."
