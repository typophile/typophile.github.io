  body: "My understanding regarding typographic quotes:\r\n\r\nIn the U.S., double
    quotes are used -- with single quotes reserved to enclose quotations nested inside
    double quotes. (Mary said, \"I couldn't believe my ears when he said &lsquo;I
    take the responsability.'&thinsp;\") In England, the opposite practice prevails.
    Other languages have still different conventions (French, for instance, uses small
    angle brackets for quotes).\r\n\r\nTypically, there is no extra space between
    the quotes and the words they enclose. However, you should watch for special situations
    the need individual attention (e.g., the quote mark touching an ascender, cap,
    symbol or single quotes immediately adjacent to double quotes, as in the example
    above) -- in these cases you need to manually increase the spacing between the
    quote and the offending character.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
