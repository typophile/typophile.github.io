body: Salutations, <BR> <BR>I have been having some problems lately.  <BR>I transfer
  my letters from Illustrator into Fontographer &#40;holding down option while copying
  and pasting&#41;, clean it up, kern it, and finally suitcase it. Yet when I use
  it in  Illustrator it&#39;s always smaller than other fonts &#40;ie. Any 24pt script
  font appears larger than my script font at 24pt &#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyone have any
  suggestions as to what I am overlooking? I would greatly appreciate it if you could!
  <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>dave

  body: 'Maybe this: <BR>Script fonts tend to need a lot of room for ascenders and
    descenders, and the normal practice of confining all the parts of all the glyphs
    &#40;well, except like the UC A-ring or something&#41; to the vertical Em-space
    makes things look tiny compared to non-script fonts &#40;or other script fonts
    with projecting extenders&#41;. So try to find a happy medium between apparent
    size and confinement of extenders. Subsequent lines might have crashes, but you
    could say that&#39;s normal in a script anyway. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
