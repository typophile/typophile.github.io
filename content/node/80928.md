body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_5299.png]\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nThese are
  all the letters I have available as samples. I don't have a clue whether the font
  has lowercase or additional weights or anything. \r\n\r\nI have already tried automated
  identifiers (Identifont, WhatTheFont, FontShop) with no luck. \r\n\r\nAny ID help
  would be greatly appreciated :-)\r\n"
