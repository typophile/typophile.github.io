  this one\u2014it is the last one! Does anyone have any ideas? It will make a lot
  of retired letterpress enthusiasts very, very happy.\r\n\r\n\u2014K\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Swashy_6030.gif]"

  body: There's also the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-goudy-oldstyle/"
    target="_blank">Lanston version</a>. It would have to be used in conjunction with
    the non-cursive italic font, but it offers LOTS of wonderful alternates.

  body: "Mac McGrew's book 'American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century' shows
    this as Goudy Cursive too. Says it was designed by him for ATF in 1916, as an
    expansion of Goudy Italic. The sample in the book appears to show that some of
    the letters in your posted sample (A, K and N) were alternate characters in the
    typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Goudy Cursive was meant to combine with either Goudy Oldstyle Italic or <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/goudy-38-rr/goudy-thirty-eight-rr-light-italic/">Goudy
    38 Italic</a>. (Goudy 38 is also called Goudy Oldstyle Light) I digitized this
    as Goudy Oldstyle Cursive. The Lanston version of Goudy Oldstyle and Oldstyle
    Bold have all the alternates in the Pro versions of the italic fonts.
