  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm writing my Ph.D. thesis (in maths), and I'm having a hell of a time trying to find the best page layout. The thesis will be printed on A4 paper, double-sided and in book form.

Normal font is Adobe Caslon Pro at 11/13.6 (the 13.6pt leading will be changed to something else later...this is just what LaTeX uses). At 11pt, that's roughly 128pt for the size of the alphabet. The textblock is currently set at around 30 picas, which is about 80 characters/line. 

I've tried various page layout templates (from the memoir package of LaTeX), including the medieval layout and Binghurt's ISO layout, but I've been unsatisfied with all of them (their textblock widths are too large and heights are too small) Basically, I'm looking for something with a smaller textblock, but still preserving a decent amount of height. 

Can someone suggest a better page layout? 

See the attached file for a sample of what I have. The file has a lot of text. The second file has more maths, which is more typical.</div>

Yes and no. For the purpose of this thread, no. I'm sort of asking for the most aesthetically pleasing layout. </div>

First off: I'd definitely lose the Zapfino. Frankly, it looks out of place – like a desperate attempt to instill some dramatic aesthetics on something that's so smart that I'd think it should be allowed to look mostly serious. :-)

Also: This would benefit from more leading, also because your line length is a bit long (something that's very hard to avoid on A4 size paper). More leading can compensate for that, to a degree, to make reading more effortless. Try giving it more air, like 15 or maybe even 16. See what happens. If this takes up too much space maybe you can give your text blocks a little more height, and/or decrease point size a tiny bit. </div>

But I definitively would avoid traditional old style numbers in a Maths work. I think they disturb the flow of reading when there are heavy numeric usage with the text. Tiempos would be a perfect alternative to Caslon.</div>

Nina, I thought it looked nice...until I got a what-was-I-thinking moment. You're absolutely right and it clashes with the subject matter. I will have to mull over a better chapter heading. For the moment, I've gone back to something simple.

Oldstyle is only used for when the fonts are typeset outside of the maths environment. So the Caslon numbers will only be used in section and figure headings. I think it's okay. I'll keep it in mind though. It's an easy fix.

> I think the page layout is good, except for the leading.

I've changed it to 14.5pt leading. I've also changed the page proportions to something I think looks better (but I'm unsure). It goes like this:

Typeblock: width = 27 picas, ratio = 2:1
Outer margin to inner margin = 2:1
Lower margin to upper margin = 2:1

The tradeoff is that there are really (really!) wide margins. What do you guys think?
