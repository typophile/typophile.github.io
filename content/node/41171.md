body: "Hey there,\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me out. I'm looking for the font which
  is used in the attached sample. I think it's a <cite>Rotis Sans</cite> however the
  ampersand does not match the <cite>Rotis Sans</cite> ampersand i know. Maybe a different
  ampersand is used, maybe it's not a <cite>Rotis Sans</cite> at all. Voices in my
  head say that <cite>Lucas de Groot</cite> is somehow involved, however I cannot
  find anything <cite>LucasFonts-related</cite>. Any help is appreciated!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPaul"

  body: Your instincts were right. It's definitely <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/agfa_rotis_65_sans_serif_bold/?sample_text=Salerooms%20Offices&sample_size=48&acs_p=1&acs_pt=24&acs=1">Rotis
    Sans Serif</a> which has a pretty nontraditional ampersand which they couldn't
    handle, so substituted it with something else.

  body: Ah, alright! Must say the ampersand used is quite a good one, good enough
    to throw me off the <cite>Rotis Sans</cite> hunch. Thanks for the help Stephen!
    Much appreciated.
