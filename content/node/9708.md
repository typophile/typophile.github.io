  there will be his sister, Kurv, who is a softer and rounder.&#41; <BR> <BR>Have
  a look at the pdf to see the current character set. I intend it to be used for titling
  and display, and will probably make some juicy ligs. Enjoy! <BR> <BR>kris. <BR><img

  body: Ooh, I like it! My one point of concern are V and W. I&#39;m afraid they might
    be just a bit too unusual, and with the joins coming in as high as they do, the
    forms feel a bit lopsided to me.

  body: love yer stuff, kris. it seems that this could be the cure for those who are
    &#34;all trajaned out.&#34; It looks to me like you got it about right, but hopefully
    some keener eyes will have a look and leave some feedback. I just hafta say that
    i love that Q!

  body: Yeah, thanks fella&#39;s! I am glad that it looks like a Trajan alternative,
    as this was a secondary objective. I will post an update as soon as.

  body: Very good stuff. For me &#39;H&#39; is to wide, and I agree with Steve about
    &#39;V&#39;, &#39;W&#39;. I like your &#39;K&#39; and &#39;R&#39;.

  body: I&#39;m a big fan of your designs, but I don&#39;t like this one.  <BR> <BR>To
    me the bent vertical serifs are overdone and draw too much attention to themselves.
    They&#39;re like knives that threaten to cut you if you get near them. The bending
    serifs on the tops of the M, N also seem droopy. And the construction of the AVW
    distracting. The A also looks too squat. Aside from this, your letters have elegance,
    but all the showy bits are too distracting for me, without being attractive. I
    know my reaction is very subjective.

  body: i agree with william on the V and W issue, whereas i don&#39;t mind that construction
    on the A. it seems to me that the Q is too dark. i&#39;d try to lighten the connection
    of the curve and the descender.

  body: Your new, regularized version is beautiful. I don&#39;t know that you had
    to go so far in totally eliminating the spikes on your vertical serifs and the
    square to thin joins of AVW.  <BR> <BR>Another interesting effort on a &#39;Forum&#39;
    style of caps is the <a href="http://www.secretonix.pt/ftf/catalogue/FTFgarda00.htm"
    target="_blank"> Garda</a> series by Mario Feliciano. Here he has serveral variations.
    I guess you could consider something similar.

  body: ps clicking the &#39;character set&#39; option on Feliciano&#39;s site, I
    see that he has also added new alternatives within each style. That also makes
    good sense in a titling face...

  body: Some of your new alternatives looks very good to me. New &#34;K&#34; and &#34;R&#34;
    with the first version of &#34;Q&#34; are perfect. You should look for the alternative
    tail in &#34;Q&#34; to your shorter &#34;K&#34; and &#34;R&#34;  <BR>I don&#39;t
    think that your new alternatives &#34;M&#34; and &#34;Y&#34; is a good idea. <BR>Please
    check out the &#34;AMNVW&#34; in New Aster Medium <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/new-aster/medium/"

    a problem with the horizontal position of the bar in A, may be you shoud change
    a little bit the shape of the bar in the &#34;A&#34; and &#34;H&#34;...
