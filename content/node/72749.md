  might also be dated (preferably from 1970s) and/or show poor design taste."

    computer print out you'd see on licences, magazine subscriptions, report cards
    etc from the 60's to the mid 80's.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typodermic.com/03.html\">Telidon</a>
    is similar to an early Epson dot matrix. But they didn't hit the streets until
    1978 . . . before that it was mostly teletypes, daisy wheels and chain printers.\r\n\r\nEarly
    daisy Wheel printers shared some of the same fonts as electric typewriters. So
    you could dig for some IBM Selectric fonts and get a similar effect.\r\n\r\nOffices
    had name plates, often with a fake woodgrain on white plastic. A router etched
    out the letters and it was usually a font like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larstornqvist/simpliciter-sans/\">this</a>
    and usually all caps."

  body: "> some IBM Selectric fonts\r\n\r\nYeah, a lot of offices in those days used
    IBM typewriters to create documents and forms. Photocopiers existed but I'm not
    sure how common they were; I remember many offices using carbon paper if they
    just needed a few copies, or mimeograph machines if they needed many.\r\n\r\nIf
    they had their forms commercially printed, it would usually be whatever fonts
    were available at the local print shop. Today we're used to having a huge number
    of fonts to choose from, but in those days a small printer often had a pretty
    limited selection, and layouts created by the printer were often dull and static
    (centered heads in caps, justified text, etc.)."
