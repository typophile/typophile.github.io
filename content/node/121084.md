  body: Interestingly, many typefaces in this style seem to have been designed in
    the sixties, and even those designed in the first half of XX century show only
    somewhat bold weights, while the sample shows at least one lighter cut.

  body: "Helvetica was released in 1957, two years before the book's publication.
    From the samples in Jaspert's _Encyclopaedia of Typefaces_ [1970, p. 294] I don't
    spot conflicts with Mergenthaler  Linotype Helvetica Extra Compressed for _man
    state war_  and Mergenthaler  Linotype Helvetica Ultra Compressed for the rest.
    However a larger scale sample may show differences.\r\nAlso this was the photo-lettering
    era so all bets are off as to whether this is manipulated lettering.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote><p>Helvetica was released in 1957 [...] I don't spot conflicts
    with Mergenthaler Linotype Helvetica Extra Compressed [...] and Mergenthaler Linotype
    Helvetica Ultra Compressed</p></blockquote>\r\nBut I dubt these styles were released
    all together the same year.\r\nI find interesting, though, that the earlier versions
    have such flat-topped |a|e|s|, etc.\r\n\r\nFoundries often adapted their best
    known typefaces to mimick other well known ones (example: https://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/12453711615/in/set-72157637025325965/)."

  body: By the way, British Inserat is a Mecanorma design, but I was unable to determine
    a date of foundation for Mecanorma.

  body: Can't agree more with you guys. That's not the first time we have to deal
    with Helvetica Ultra/Extra Compressed but the digital version does not match at
    all. Take /s for instance, its overall shape design differs too much for Linotype
    Helvetica Ultra/Extra Compressed. That's also why I didn't even mention Helvetica
    in my first post and suggested Compacta, which overall design looks closer but
    not matching than LT H U/E C.
