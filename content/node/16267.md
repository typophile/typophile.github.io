  body: Sick looking type? You could always just set it badly! Or mash it up in a
    drawing programme. There's always <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/products/fuse04.cfm">Caustic
    Biomorph</a> and I have a hunch that out there, somewhere, is lurking a font named
    'Ebola'...

  body: "what's the destination? screen or print?\r\n\r\nthe first thing that came
    to mind when i saw the word \"plague\" was the black plague, historically, which
    made me think \"baroque,\" and i thought of storm's beautiful <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/regu.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">regula</a>. (actually, regula is probably too beautiful to be
    sick.)\r\n\r\nbut if the context is...i don't know, say, contemporary germ warfare,
    then how about one of house industries' distressed faces, like <a href=\"http://www.houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=201&subpage=lettersetter\"
    target=\"_blank\">housecopy</a>?"

    book</a> has an experiment where a type designer had grown culture in petri dishes
    in the shapes of letters and then made a font on the stages of growth, so as the
    culture grew the letter became bolder. Unfortunately I don't have the book to
    hand so I can't tell you the designer or the name of the font (if it was released),
    but it was a fun experiment.\r\nTim"
