  so that I can purchase it and I'm really struggling because I know next to nothing
  about typography! From my own searching and peering, it looks like Optima Bold,
  but without the swelling(?) at the terminals.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if someone could be
  kind enough to point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated."

  body: "There have been 'versions' of Optima, such as Image Club's Omni (sample attached),
    which did not use the slight flaring of the terminals. I suspect that was an easier
    way to re-create a font that had much of the same feel, without exactly copying
    the font. Your sample may be one of those Optima look-alikes.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OmniSample_5608.gif]"
