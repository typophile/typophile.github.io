  side of a microlight plane the identification mrkings (usually done with pre-spaced
  self adhesive), but I can't find the font I like.\r\n\r\nLooks like (apart the military
  one, called \"Amarillo\") that two kind are the most used. One can be seen on this
  [[http://www.cessna.com/MungoBlobs/889/41/mm_1280_162_ext-01.jpg | <strong> <ul>Cessna
  162 </ul></strong>]] \r\n\r\nThe other is in the sample included. \r\n\r\nBy the
  way, it should be available both with the right and left slanted characters.\r\n\r\nI've
  tried in a great number of font sites, but with no luck.\r\n\r\nIs it there some
  kind soul which can help me?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for any help.\r\n\r\nBest
  regards, Max"

    I think you will be unlikely to find a font that matches the style and has the
    slants too.\r\n\r\nThe closest font I found so far was Nick Curtis's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/route-66-nf/|Route
    66]]. Other fonts had bigger problems with the '1', or the 6 or 9 not being closed
    the same way.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
