  body: 'This is hand-lettered for sure. <BR> <BR>As Mike would say, there are  ton
    of fonts that closely mimic handwriting. You can search any of the font sites
    like Myfonts or Dafont and find tons of them. Or go to Mike&#39;s site: www.bowfinprintworks.com
    and search his archive.'

  body: It is handwriting. None of the letters are exactly the same. But you can get
    a pretty similar feeling with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/sketchley-bt/">Sketchley</a>.

  body: I couldn&#39;t have said it better Patty. <BR> <BR>This style of hand-printed
    lettering is mostly in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>, but some more formal-looking
    printed hand lettering is found in Part 6 &#40;fonts like Tekton, Stylus, Blueprint,
    etc.&#41;.

    <BR>I think <a href="http://www.typequarry.com/type.html?sku=016" target="_blank">
    Marydale</a> is an excelent alternative.
