  in the font for the title, \"Scorched.\"  This font was lost in a computer crash.
  \ It's very similar to one called \"Vanessa,\" but isn't quite the same.  Any clues?"

    is a very similar font and will do in a pinch, but this one stole my heart!

  body: "I finally looked at Vanessa (at Dafont) and realized that is probably what
    was used to make the lettering of your sample. Some sort of type styling software
    was used, possibly Photoshop, or Illustrator, and probably with some editing of
    features that didn't make good 3D shapes. I think Vanessa is the answer you were
    looking for.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
