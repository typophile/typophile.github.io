  body: "I'm not saying one of these is the same, but I have noticed during searches
    for this question that [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Flat-it/|Flat-it]] foundry
    has a number of scripts which have many of the elegant forms, similar to Bickham.
    See Daisy Lau, Machia, Lily Wang and Pansy Bo, in particular. It seems that all
    of these scripts are the work of Riyoichi Tsunekawa. If what you are looking at
    is a customization of Bickham, or even just a similar font (perhaps custom), here
    is one designer who seems to have similar skill. I'm sure he's not the only one,
    but this style seems to be one of his strong suits.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Greg,\r\nyour sample <em>is</em> <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/bickham.html\">Bickham
    Script</a>.\r\nNote that this OpenType font has a lot of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/bickham_script_pro_semi_bold/&s=c?acs=1&acs_ss=1\">alternate
    forms</a>. If you enable \u2018contextual alternates\u2019 (in an OpenType-savvy
    application like InDesign), the glyphs will automatically change to what you have
    in your sample \u2013\_including the \u2018k\u2019.\r\nI must admit your sample
    looks more upright \u2026 maybe it was electronically skewed, or this is due to
    the reproduction.\r\nF"

  body: I tried the open-type panel in Illustrator, and I looked at the glyphs of
    the typeface. I can't find the "k", "x" "i", "b" or "w" in any of the glyphs.
    It may be custom, I just want to know for sure. We are printing their new brochure
    and these alternatives are used throughout the whole brochure, which makes me
    think it may not be custom.
