  take the half down in size and bump it up so that it alines with the big 1?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nStephen"

    to see 1\xBD instead of 1 1/2."

  body: "If the font you are using doesn't have the fraction you need and you are
    setting in quark there is an option to create fractions in the typestyles menu
    and a similar option in Indesign with opentype fonts (where available).\r\nTim\r\n{edit:
    this doesn't produce ideal results because it uses the same weight at a smaller
    size, so the numerals look too light}"
