body: "I'm looking for a simple, highly legible workhorse of a script that can be
  used in display contexts (logos, signage, embroidery, etc.) as well as in small
  sizes (business cards, footers). Classic, relatively unadorned shapes with no hairline
  strokes, maybe even with bold strokes (but not a casual or brush script), plus large
  x-heights and wide-open loops and counters. The Cadillac logo is in the right direction:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-cadillac&#91;1&#93;_4970.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"

  body: The various scripty fonts for sports uniforms would seem to satisfy your criteria,
    but I don't think that's really what you're looking for. They're all mean to be
    embroidered and read at a distance,  and are very klutzy. Because of their broad
    strokes and large counters, they reduce very well. See such as Nick Curtis' TeamSpirit,  Letterhead's
    Pilsner, Jawfonts' Fenway Park, etc.

  body: "A good suggestion, HVB, and \"legible from a distance\" is a key requirement,
    but you're right, I'm looking for something less casual and more elegant.\r\n\r\nDonald
    Young's \"Young Gallant\" would be a good candidate if the strokes had less contrast

    Jess Latham's \"Fancier Script\" is pretty close, but I think I'd prefer something
    just a touch less casual and more elegant:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3588ad89db90f35b8283c39f43c589&#91;1&#93;_3915.gif]"

  body: "Wow, thanks for opening my eyes to the full work of Sudtipos and Alejandro
    Paul. And thanks for the correction on Doyald Young. But the closest I found to
    what I want is Altast Greeting, which was in the Bowfin Printworks index HVB linked
    to:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temp_3793.png]\r\n\r\nThere are
    issues with it: It's a free TTF and not all the connectors connect properly, but
    it has basic, classic shapes, a high x-height and wide counters. I had to add
    some weight to it so the connectors weren't too thin, but that's easy to do. It's
    not entirely timeless, in that you can tell it comes from a previous era, but
    it doesn't feel terribly out-of-place today. It could use a little work.\r\n\r\nStill,
    I'm surprised I can't find something like this from a major typographer. Someone
    could create sort of the Gotham of scripts in that it's so basic, unadorned, classic,
    timeless, versatile and well-crafted that it's just the standard script that everyone
    should have a copy of.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temp_3784.png]"

  body: Well, Shelley is centuries old, and you can tell. Altast Greeting also looks
    a bit dated, but at least it looks like it could theoretically be the work of
    someone who is still alive today. Ideally, I would want something that looks both
    current and classic at the same time.

    font that is too regular, which implies a lack of legibility \u2014 a logo is
    something very different than a bit of text. "

  body: "Regular in the sense of similar and repetitive forms. One needs some differentiation
    between glyphs to recognize them \u2014 hopefully instantly. Example: two lowercase
    u\u2019s could be mistaken for a w and a dotless i, etcetera. \r\n\r\nA logo breeds
    familiarity due to repetition (advertising, fleetmarking) and gets its own persona
    in time. You may have seen experiments where certain words or texts were rendered
    in the style of famous wordmarks, where recognition trumps legibility, eg:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/enjoy-coke-cocaine-andigear_5473.jpeg]"

  body: Oh, yeah, the "uvw" is confusing and could use some work, but those letters
    don't normally go together. Otherwise, I thought the font was quite clear, especially
    for a script. Still, I'm not saying this is my ideal font, but it's close.
