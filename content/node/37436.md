  there been any studies concerning typography in the environment?  Particularly environments
  for local communities, such as parks,  regeneration areas, street signs etc.\r\n\r\nYour
  help would be gratefully appreciated.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nChris"

    :)\r\n\r\nFirst I'll tell you to type \"Cleaview\" in up in the little search
    box at the top of this page and continue from there. You should find quite a bit
    of information. Also try \"wayfinding\" and \"signage\" as well."

    a typeface for a local community such as Muenster or Doncaster I guess it's important
    to get a thorough understanding of that community's history?\r\n\r\nChris"

  body: "\r\nI'm still struggling to find information/debate regarding designing for
    regional identity. For example Peter Saville's recent Manchester work. I would
    also like to be able to look at comparative developments in Leeds, Norfolk, South
    Yorkshire, Brittany, The Basque, North Rhein Westfalia  etc.\r\n\r\nI'm probably
    using the wrong search terms. Any help would be gratefully appreciated. \r\n\r\nIf
    there have been no such comparative studies I may undertake an investigation myself.
    Please let me know you thoughts on this idea.\r\n\r\nChris Matthews\r\n\r\nTel.

    a few weeks ago. See: http://atypi.org/05_Brighton/20_main_program\r\n\r\nI can't
    remember who said it, but I've found it very convincing: most interesting in respect
    to bringing liveliness into your design are, first of all, the real people living
    there, followed by historical and cultural background information and of course
    there are some licensing requirements to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nFor Peter
    Saville take some time to watch the little film about the interview talked about
    here: http://www.typophile.com/node/37612 \r\n\r\nAnd there are some pdfs picturing
    \"traffic signs to tourist attractions in England\" e.g. here: http://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk/dmrb/vol8/section2.htm"

    musing Mr Shin - well put.\r\n\r\nAnd great photos Mili - nice one. I think a
    student of Tony Pritchards at LCC recently did a study comparing shop signs in
    different streets in London, such as Mile End Rd with some road in Chelsea. Great
    idea and so simple.\r\n\r\nTa\r\n\r\nChris Matthews\r\n\r\nTel. (+44) 07807169415\r\nhttp://www.cmatthews.co.uk"
