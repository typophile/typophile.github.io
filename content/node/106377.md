  etc. with no real luck. It seems like I can find the right M in the wrong family,
  the right Q and O in the wrong family, the right R in the wrong family, J, etc...\r\n\r\nI
  am having wedding invitations made by this company, but would like to make an accompanying
  website and cannot for the life of me find this font. I am happy to buy the font
  regardless of price as long as I can find the exact match. Cursive identification
  a plus!\r\n\r\nFrom Book: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/img156_6196.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn

  you ahead of time!"

    Q and G are off, but I can probably just mod them in FontForge or do some similar
    hack. Thoughts?"
