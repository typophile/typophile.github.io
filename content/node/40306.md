  body: "Thanks for the comments, glad you like the idea.!\r\n\r\nStarted out wanting
    to say something about the noose - and wound up talking about capital punishment
    in general. I thought that the game Hangman, made for a recognizable metaphor.\r\n\r\nI
    like the font that came out of this concept. The many aggressive quick strokes
    which comprise a letter form can be taken as to represent many voices - at least
    in my mind they can ;) When finished I hope to get this piece out there >>> somehow,
    either on a canvas, print, or submitting it as a cartoon. "
