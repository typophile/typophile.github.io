body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI just started working on a new typeface. Working title is
  \"Inky\", not so very sure of that name in the first place. I was thinking about
  the ink splatters/clouds that Cephalopods eject. Some of the shapes used refer to
  a stylized version of ink blurps so to say.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I started with the capitals,
  see below. The C, G and U might still need a bit of work (or a complete rework maybe).
  The M and N are quite wide compared to the other letters but I'm unsure right now
  how to solve that. Quite pleased with how the V and W turned out - although on some
  points these might stand out a bit.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Inky-werk-1_6604.png]\r\n\r\nComments
  and suggestions most welcome!"

    too much white space between it and subsequent letters or not. \r\n\r\nDid you
    try an /I/ with the heaviest part at the top rather than bottom?"

  body: "Thanks Craig, will try the /Y/. Would you suggest using a vertical decender
    (stem?) for the /Y/ instead?\r\n\r\nInteresting suggestion about the /I/ too -
    I found it a bit inconsistent in relation to the /J/ but at the same time there
    are many other letters with a top heavy stem, so it should be ok.\r\n\r\nbottom-heavy
    versus top-heavy /I/ (top heavy looks pretty to me)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pill_hij_6501.png]\r\n\r\nalternate
