    or just the regular U.S. version of InDesign?  <BR> <BR>Adam

  body: You can&#39;t typeset Arabic on the regular version of InDesign. It doesn&#39;t
    support right-to-left rendering, the contextual selection of initial and final
    forms, vowels positioning etc. But all that is supported in InDesign ME. Best
    would be to us a Unicode-encoded Arabic font with OpenType layout features. I
    don&#39;t think Nazanin exists in such a version, so InDesign ME may or may not
    support it. But InDesign ME ships with Winsoft Naskh Pro, a quite reasonable OpenType
    Arabic text face. I sugges that you give Nazanin a try in InDesign ME, if it doesn&#39;t
    work then either use Winsoft Naskh Pro or contact Linotype for information regarding
    availability of Nazanin in OpenType.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam

  body: Titus,  <BR> <BR>Perhaps the font will work in InDesign ME after all. Otherwise,
    you may contact Linotype so they exchange the font to a different format, or refund
    you &#40;if they have such policy, I don&#39;t know&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam
