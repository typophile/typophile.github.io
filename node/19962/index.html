<p>As I understood, it is possible to script <em>any</em> task in InDesign (CS2), which is quite remarkable. His JavaScript demos were very insightful and easy to follow. (Like Python, JavaScript is an object-oriented language, so the two are quite similar in may aspects). The ExtendScript Toolkit application (that comes with the CS2 Suite) also makes scripting much simple.</p>
<p>I was simply amazed how one can enhance InDesign&rsquo;s capabilities and batch process repetitive tasks quite easily. As anyone ever wished Photoshop&rsquo;s <em>Contact Sheets</em> or Illustrator&rsquo;s <em>Crop Marks</em> inside InDesign? Well, it&rsquo;s actually all possible! Simply download <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/xml_scripting.html#sresources">these ready-made scripts</a> and place them in [InDy folder]/Presets/Scripts/. Then it&rsquo;s just a matter of bringing up the &lsquo;Scripts&rsquo; palette (Window-&gt;Automation-&gt;Scripts) and start clicking**. Definitely worth trying!</p>
<p>Also worth following:
<a href="http://jsid.blogspot.com/"><a href="http://jsid.blogspot.com/">http://jsid.blogspot.com/</a></a>
<a href="http://www.indesignsecrets.com/">http://www.indesignsecrets.com/</a></p>
<p>** The script &ldquo;ImageCatalog.jsx&rdquo; does the Photoshop-like function, and &ldquo;CropMarks.jsx&rdquo; the Illustrator-like one.</p>

<p>Big &lsquo;but&rsquo;: Despite of all nice things that scripting allows for, some automation should be available to non-scripters too.

<li>{edit: To my understanding, scripting InDesign in Python is kind of an add-on, which requires different solutions on Win and Mac (here it&rsquo;s kind of Python &lsquo;clothes&rsquo; around AppleScript), and such Python scripts are not altogether platform compatible &ndash; which I would consider a must for a cross-platform application like InDesign.}</li>

<p>I asked Olav Kvern about it. He said that the commitment is to support each platform&rsquo;s native scripting language — AppleScript/Mac, VBScript/Windows — and one cross-platform language (JavaScript). Nonetheless, his opinion is that more languages should be supported, rather than less. His goal is to allow people to script in whichever language they&rsquo;re more comfortable with. So, stay tuned :)</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s debatable. We still don&rsquo;t have <em>real</em> artificial intelligence, or computers that can read the ideas we have on our minds and simply execute them, so people will still have to do some of the work. The way things are made available (documentation, samples, drag-and-drop, double-clicking, code hinting, etc) effectively simplify a lot of the stuff, even for &lsquo;native&rsquo; non-scripters.</p>
<p>I just think that people relate the word &lsquo;scripting&rsquo; to something that only computer scientists can do. While that was very true some time ago, nowadays things are much much simpler. People just haven&rsquo;t got around to become aware of that, and to realise that a simple 5-line script, for example, can have a big impact on their daily work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m glad to inform you that the Python Imaging Library version 1.1.6b1 now correctly supports Unicode-compatible text rendering using Type 1, TrueType and OpenType fonts. You cannot access OpenType Layout features, just plain Unicode codepoints, and of course you can only render bitmaps, not vectors. But it&rsquo;s quite powerful and works really nice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with the library&rsquo;s author Fredrik Lundh on a fix of a problem that causes PIL to crash on quite many fonts. The good news is that recently released version 1.1.6b1 does not have the problem anymore!</p>
<p>You can get the newest build of PIL at:

<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t expect any <cite>intelligence</cite> from the applications' side!</p>
<p>Yet, one has to understand how scripting is supposed to work. On two levels, the scripting language, and the application&rsquo;s own peculiarities. (InDesign example for the latter: deal with script UI and defaults in units other than inch/point.) If it just were: grab some elements and copy/paste, this would be nice. But, despite some great sources, this is not really possible.</p>
<p>One obstacle may indeed be designers' fear of scripting. Maybe fear of working systematically, too?  ;-)</p>
