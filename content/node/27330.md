  files when moving from a PC to a Macbook Pro for design this past month.\r\n\r\nI
  lost a design I was working on, and the font I was using with it.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  ID the font used for the logo here: http://substruct.subimage.com/\r\n\r\nI think
  it's in the Bauhaus family, but the ITC Bauhaus isn't a direct match. The closest
  thing I can find on my computer is Bauhaus93, but the weight is way too heavy. I
  remember having multiple weights of this font, as I also created a heavier version
  of the logo, but not as heavy as Bauhaus93.\r\n\r\nNotice it's close to ITC Bauhaus,
  but the S is shaped differently, and the lowercase b is connected all the way through.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help???"

  body: "I agree with the Chalet Paris 1970 ID, particularly because of the S shape.
    The Chalet family was based on Bauhaus-related fonts and Avant Garde Gothic (apparently).
    I was thinking 'Pump light', but it's not this light and the S and c don't match
    well.\r\n\r\nOdd that you would forget if you had Chalet, though.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    with a download to replace your lost files. Some foundries do this for registered
    users.
