body: 'Hi there, <BR> <BR>I am trying to identify the font that was used for the poster
  artwork of &#34;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&#34;. <BR> <BR>My sample is
  pretty big, so I&#39;ll just link to it: <BR><a href="http://www.adventurefan.de/birdseed/lxg_font.jpg">
  Sample</a> <BR> <BR>I am not sure, but I think the white font and the greenish font
  are the same. However, the white font uses capital letters only for the &#39;L&#39;
  in &#39;League&#39;, the &#39;E&#39; in &#39;Extraordinary&#39; and the &#39;G&#39;
  in Gentlemen whereas the green font is all in captions. <BR>Thus I&#39;d assume
  that only capital letters have those spikes. <BR> <BR>In case I am wrong and it
  is indeed two different fonts that were used, then I&#39;d be very grateful to find
  out both font types. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help, <BR>Chris'

  body: The white font is Bank Gothic, though bolder than the sample linked. The caps
    are definitely &#40;I think&#41; another font. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/medium/testdrive.html?s=THE%2BLEAGUE&amp;p=72"
