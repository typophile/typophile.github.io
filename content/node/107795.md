  new book from UK publisher Spellmount.\r\nI  know of several similar fonts by Cooper,
  Goudy, Colwell etc., but none are a match. \r\nAny suggestions? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FeedingTommy2013_5830.jpg]\r\nPrevious

  body: "Many thanks Fivos.\r\nAnother gem from Nick Curtis -- the most prolific font-maker
    of our era.\r\nIt really works in giving the right period flavor to the book.\r\nAccording
    to Nick's font source expert, the Dutch fellow,  the design is by Joseph Bertram
    Jowit and was published in _Modern Show Card Writing (1922)_.\r\nDon"
