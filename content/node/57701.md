body: Hello I'm trying to start my very own magazine and I was wondering if anyone
  knew the page size and margin sizes?  Or if theres a good website with the format
  ,because I'm not sure what the font size should be either. Well thanks a lot and
  if I can get help it will be greatly appreciated. I really want to give this my
  best shot.

    out where it is printed. Then phone the printers and ask what sizes they can handle.
    Most places have a range of sizes, depending on press and configuration.\r\n\r\nAt
    the same time you will be able to get some ideas of print runs and (though you
    will have to talk to a salesperson for this) costs with different types of papers.
    You will need to know these things as you work out your business plan.\r\n\r\nYou
    were thinking of creating a business plan, weren't you?"
