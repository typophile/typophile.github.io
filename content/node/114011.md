    They don't have N & W but you might find a reasonable substitute in their wide
    variety of choices. It would take some time to go through them. A quick run though
    them turned up Pennsylvania 1930s, which is based on lettering once used by the
    Pennsylvania Railroad for coach names in the 1930's. Reasonable price.\r\nDon"

    those other 2 and they definitely might be worth a shot. And @donshottype I like
    the numerals in the fonts you suggested from letterhead fonts. \r\n\r\nGot a lot
    of good suggestions . Thanks so much"
