body: "Hello to All:\r\n\r\nI have this Font ID task for you experts... my client
  told me this font is called \"Assembly\" and \"Assembly Outline\" but I got tired
  of looking for it over the Internet without any success... so I turn to you guys...
  I'm pretty sure I've seen it before, long time ago, It feels like an \"Image Club\"
  type of thing...\r\n\r\nHere's the font in question...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IM_5155.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'll
  be around... Thanks in advance...\r\n\r\nQ\u2122 Says: It's all about the fonts!!"
