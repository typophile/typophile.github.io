  \r\n\r\nI'm working on an animation that uses typography and this piece will need
  to be localized for several different languages. I am hoping I can find a nice,
  simple bold sans serif face (ala Helvietica, Akzidenz) for the non-latin languages
  to keep things consistent and as close to brand standards as possible. Any ideas?"

    type of question comes up quite often, and I always say the same things. Resist
    the urge to use a simple one-font-for-all-scripts solution. Stay away from Arial
    Unicode. Choose typefaces that were actually designed specifically for the scripts,
    taking into consideration what kind of typographic palette you are going to need,
    e.g. you might need a bold and a regular.\r\n\r\nIn your case, the Chinese logographs
    used in Japanese and Mandarin are going to impose a restriction on just how bold
    your typefaces can get, because they can be quite dense.\r\n\r\nChoose a typeface
    that has good Latin and Cyrillic designs (these two scripts are often designed
    together). Choose a Japanese typeface of the Gothic (sans serif) style and a Simplified
    Chinese typeface of the Hei style that match each other's style very closely.
    Choose a monolinear Arabic typeface with a similar overall feel. Of course, it
    is tricky to judge the design merits of typefaces not in your native script, so
    make use of Typophile to invite opinions on your choices."
