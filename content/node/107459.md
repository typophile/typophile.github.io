body: "Hi,\r\nI'm not a type designer but I like reading and writing on my laptop
  and, as a consequence, I like good typography on screen. I need to buy a new laptop
  and I'm thinking about the brand new MacBook Pro 13\" Retina.\r\n\r\nAs you know,
  this computer has an effective workspace of 1280x800, smaller than MacBook Air's
  1440x900, but it is possible to set display preferences to get a larger workspace:
  1440x900 or 1680x1050 (so-called scaled resolutions).\r\n\r\nWhat happens, in your
  experience, when the resolution is set at a value other than ideal/retina? Do scaled
  resolutions impact on font/image sharpness, cpu performance, battery life, etc.?
  I love the retina display, but a 1280x800 workspace is just too small for my needs,
  so I plan to use the laptop always at 1440x900.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nManosk"
