  <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=243335#history\">Monotype's
  version</a> is more suited for text use and smaller sizes (which is what I'm looking
  for). Can anyone else confirm this? Are there any other versions that any of you
  prefer more?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

    target=\"_blank\">benton sans</a> instead of the original news gothic?\r\n\r\n<cite>In
    1903 faced with the welter of sans offered by ATF, Morris Fuller Benton designed
    News Gothic, a 20th century standard. In 1995 Tobias Frere-Jones studied drawings
    in the Smithsonian and started a redesign. Cyrus Highsmith reviewed News Gothic,
    and with the Font Bureau studio expanded it into Benton Sans.</cite>"

  body: "Benton Sans is probably a better version -- unfortunately the Font Bureau
    does not offer an italic (or oblique), plus their license prohibits PDF embedding.\r\n\r\nI'm
    mainly interested in Monotype's version since it seems a little wider than other
    versions with a little more tapering at the joints. Perhaps they digitized their
    version from a text size whereas others used a larger size (which seems to be
    the case with many revivals)."

    available for most weights of Benton Sans.

  body: "Have you seen <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/115093/linotypegothic-family.html\">Linotype
    Gothic</a>? Its our new News Gothic, in OpenType with lots of language support.
    I used it to typeset my article in the newest issue of the [[Linotype Matrix]],
    and I think that its italic is very \"opinionated\"\u2026 if you can say that
    about a typeface's personality\u2026"

  body: "Thanks Dan, but Linotype Gothic has that same narrowness that I've disliked
    with other versions of News Gothic -- I did, however, forget about Vectora...\r\n\r\nI'm
    mainly looking for an American style gothic that works well for longer texts.\r\n\r\nBTW
    -- I have put in a call to Font Bureau and I'm waiting to hear back."
