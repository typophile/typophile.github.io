  some investigation I narrowed to some type specimens books here probably the typefaces
  are. These books are very rare and cant find them digitalized online.\r\nMy question
  is:\r\nDoes anyone here knows or owns any type specimens books from the beginning
  of the XX century (to WWII) from these companies?\r\n\r\nBauer & co., Stuttgart
  & H. Berthold. Berlin\r\nBauersche Schriftgiesserei\r\nStempel \r\nLettergieterij
  Tetterode (Amsterdam Typefoundry)\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    der Schriftgie\xDFereien, a registry of typefaces from many of the German foundries.
    The cards generally include full character sets."

    but none of the afore mentioned specimen contain wood typefaces."
