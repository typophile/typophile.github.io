  two to use for a mid-century, Europeanish card game...something slightly swiss and
  a bit serious. \r\nI know the usual suspects, but I've been looking at some wildcards:
  FF BAU, Akkurat, DIN ROUNDED, FOUNDERS GROT, and ROUTER (which would really soften
  up the look and lower the age group).\r\n\r\nAny wild and crazy suggestions?"

  body: "Thanks guys. \r\n\r\nNick, I think your suggestion is a little too expressive,
    but I like it. ARS Maquette looks like it might be perfect. It's well-balanced
    (on my screen), has good color and I don't see it stepping on the artwork to come.
    \r\n\r\nThe field narrows..."

  body: "Not sure if you want/need any more suggestions, but how about Graphik maybe:
    http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik\r\n\r\nOr if you want something that's
    actually Swiss, Replica might be interesting too (it's a bit fresher than Akkurat,
    and I think less frequently used too): \r\nhttp://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Replica/\r\n\r\nMore
    classic/closer to what you had with ARS Maquette:\r\nTheinhardt from Optimo (also
    a Swiss foundry)\r\nhttp://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/index.php?id_categorie=1&id_font=22\r\n\r\nYou
    might also want to look through this list over at FontShop:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/helvetica/"
