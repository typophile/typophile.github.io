I was trying to make it look corporate and sporty at the same time.  Any suggestions as to what I should change?

		<div class="commentbody">Here's a list of changes.

1. Kern the D and the Y tighter, the T and Y a little more loosely.
2. Add more spacing between the Y and S (the words bleed together way too much).\
3. Sporting Goods is tracked out way to much (I agree with Maxwell's reply.)
4. More contrast between font choices. Maybe select a serif for Sporting Goods.
5. The 2 lines are too thick, set them at half the stroke weight used.

All in all, this would be a great logo if this was a line of apparel, but I don't really see it working as well as logo for store. Considering the logo would have to work at sizes and in wide variety of applications. It's almost too clean, and equally lifeless. 

Get more clever, it's called Dynasty Sport, create a Crown logo with various sporting goods. Make a mark that would be easily remembered and recognized (think the bent staple in Staples.)</div>

What serif would be an excellent choice?  Also incorportating a crown where do you think that would best fit in this?   Thank you guys for all the suggestions and I appreciate this so very much.

		<div class="commentbody">This makes me think of two other brands: Paul Mitchell for the design & typeface and Nautica for the color.

I'd modify something, even the Paul Mitchell logo is a modified version of Eurostile. It's almost a stencil font now, and the "A" is actually built from an upside-down "U."

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pm_logo_5707.png]


Do something to make it unique and stand out from everything else, some kind of distinguishing mark. The Microsoft logo isn't all that amazing but it does have that little wedge taken out of the "o," and that's something you remember.

"Sporting Goods" does need to be a different font... it needs to be either the same face (or at least the same family) as "DynastySports" or a serif face.
You've got a good foundation; you just need to tweak it further. Have fun!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Patty. Try Eurostile/Microgamma for Dynasty Sport and regular Eurostile for Sporting Goods. An other good idea I've found to work a lot of time is to use two typefaces by the same designer. Because they're designed by the the same person the sensibilities of the faces are usually very close. Take a look at some Novarese's serif faces.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Like Brad said, it's all Nautica and Mitchell right now. Get some motion into it; it feels awfully static for a sporting goods identity. I think you might even try something as subtle as a playful baseline for the DYNASTYSPORT, and then go serif for the second line.

One more thing: the super-tracked U&lc looks amateurish. A different face, an all-cap setting -- maybe even a hand-script if you want the extra width -- would work better.</div>

Are you referring to the part that says Sporting Goods?

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. I'm not loving the cap/small cap look - even tho I realize they aren't exactly the same (the "small caps" being extended). The caps  look squooshed and the weights don't match. You also have a problem with those two G's and the awkward space under the cap S. I think a rule between the two lines might help. Something just looks off-balance here. Your kerning/tracking on the second line isn't good either, especially in "goods". Maybe there's some sort of symbol you can use between the G's that will relate somehow to the S above them? I'd also suggest not tracking the second line to the width of the top line, let it be shorter and centered.

I like your first logo better, even tho it does remind me of other existing logos.</div>

I would go back to black and white, track down 'sporting goods' and give it a bit of breathing room off the 'd..sports' baseline. Never let meaningless embellishments, which are confusing, steer your design.

		<div class="commentbody">I know you have only shown us 3 examples, but it seems like you don't have a concept. It seems like you are just trying to decide on a typeface. I would suggest stepping away from the computer and doing a lot of sketches with a pencil and paper. Also, do a lot of research of competitor's logos.

A resource is the Logo Design Workbook.

Be aware of the image the company wants to portray--energetic, fun, sophisticated, expensive, discount. Also be aware that the logo will be used on exterior signage on the side of the building and in newspaper ads. Right now your concepts would not work effectively as signage. </div>
