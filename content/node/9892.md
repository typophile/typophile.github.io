  body: The word spacing on number 1 has alot to be desired. Its too spaced out. Number
    2 gave me an idea for you to explore. Since its Architechure, why not make the
    background a textured surface and have the word Studio cut into it, or as raised
    lettering. What does SM mean? Do you need to put the  words that SM refer to on
    the cover?

  body: When you say &#34;the word spacing on number 1&#34;, I&#39;m assuming you
    mean the words &#34;architecture publication...&#34;. I&#39;ll look into other
    fonts that are &#34;clean&#34; but not as spaced out.  <BR> <BR>As for the texture...
    I started out with a  lightly textured background simulating linen paper, but
    I didn&#39;t like how it looked. Somehow the type didn&#39;t look as crisp.  <BR>
    <BR>As for the raised lettering, that&#39;s an option I&#39;m going to explore
    with the printer, regardless of which cover I go with.  <BR> <BR>SM stands for
    &#34;studio magazine&#34; . Right now my choices stand between the initials of
    the mag &#34;SM&#34; or the word &#34;Studio&#34;. I&#39;m kind of favoring the
    SM option because it will attract the attention of potential readers even if initially
    it is for the double entendre the letters SM imply. I&#39;m banking on the curiosity
    of people to make them pick up the mag, and by not giving away the title immediately,
    as with the &#34;STUDIO&#34; option, I&#39;ll have people wonder what SM is. The
    answer to what SM stands for is on the first page once you open the mag.   <BR>
    <BR>Remember, it&#39;s a first ever issue... my school has never had an architecture
    publication before, so the pressure to make it attractive is enormous.  <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for your suggestions.  <BR>Susana.

  body: Susana, is the magazine square? In other words, does the red/orange field
    represent the edges of the magazine, or does the colored square &#34;float&#34;
    on an 8.5 x 11 page? <BR> <BR>In any case, if you&#39;re relying on typography
    for impact, you need better-looking type! The large sans-serif you&#39;re using
    for &#34;SM&#34; is poorly drawn. Look at the kinks in the inner curves of the
    S, for example. Are these shareware/freeware fonts? You&#39;d be wise to spring
    for professionally designed type if you&#39;re going to use it at monumental size.

  body: Marc,  <BR> <BR>Yes, the magazine is square. Its format is 8.5&#34; x 8.5&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>When I first submitted the post, I was working on a PC. The InDesign file
    that I was working on came from a PC, as well as the series of PDF&#39;s that
    I uploaded. Now that I&#39;m on the Mac I&#39;ve downloaded the PDF&#39;s and
    they look dramatically different from what they are supposed to be. I&#39;m referring
    to the font in all the iterations of the SM variant. If you&#39;re seeing a blocky
    Sans then you&#39;re not seeing the font that&#39;s supposed to be there. For
    some reason, Acrobat Reader is changing the font to someting else &#40;!!!&#41;,
    something I haven&#39;t seen before. In any case, the real SM font looks more
    like the one I used for the &#34;STUDIO&#34; variant, kind of broken and &#34;dirty&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>On the other hand, if you&#39;re seeing a broken font in the SM iterations
    then everything is fine and I might be having issues with the Mac.  <BR> <BR>In
    all cases, the fonts used are shareware. The magazine&#39;s budget is a bit tight,
    so I thought it might be best to throw some ideas out there using free fonts and
    then see which one looks best, before I commit to an expensive font. In my very
    limited experience with fonts I&#39;ve noticed that for every ten free fonts that
    look somehow similar to one another &#40;and are of varying quality&#41; I can
    find one or two quality commercial fonts that look similar to the free ones but
    are better. That said, do you have any suggestions for a commercial font that
    looks &#34;dirty&#34;?  <BR> <BR>I checked out the &#34;Design Easy Cover Patterns&#34;
    PDF. While it was informative, it didn&#39;t help me out much, mostly because
    the examples given rely on graphics as well as text to make a strong cover. I&#39;m
    only &#40;intentionally&#41; relying on text &#40;color and placement are both
    givens&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I will replace the PDF&#39;s with JPEG&#39;s when I get
    back to the PC, just to make sure that everyone is seeing the same thing.  <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for your help,  <BR>Susana.

  body: Susana, please talk to your printer before venturing further with a square
    format. You might be occuring a lot of paper loss. There is a reason for the size
    of publications and most of the time its because of the economy of paper and if
    you mail a square format you are heavly penalized by the post office.  <BR> <BR>As
    for the raised type, create it in photoshop using a layer style, you won&#39;t
    be able to afford embossing from a printer.  <BR> <BR>Post your revisions, but
    could you make them jpgs or gifs? Its easy to do in InDesign.

  body: The Architecture line is better. Did you explore setting it in Sentence Case?
    Also did you try a contrasting typeface. Leave the Architectural look to the SM
    vol 1 and make the Architecture line something more warm &#40;more human&#41;,
    less structured. An example might be using Daliance Italic from Emigre.  <BR>
    <BR>Have you contacted your printer about the square format yet? Its an issue
    you need to resolve right away, before you go to far into the design.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Red is my favorite color, but I&#39;m terribly partial

    I&#39;ll probably explore those possibilities for the next issue, but for the
    first one I wanted to go as simple as possible, maybe to give the mag some sort
    of dignity &#40;I don&#39;t know how much &#34;dignity&#34; a student publication
    about architecture can have, but I guess I&#39;m aiming at that&#41;. For the
    next issue I&#39;ll try a more complex cover &#40;if only in terms of background&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Tim,  <BR> <BR>You said:  <BR>&#34;[...]if you print this the limitation of
    the font will be revealed[...]&#34;  <BR> <BR>I agree. I didn&#39;t quite notice
    that until you mentioned it, but I agree. One way I think this problem might be
    addressed is by maybe playing with the fonts in Fireworks &#40;maybe blurring
    it a bit, or playing with different shades of orange for a &#34;glow&#34;. I&#39;ll
    fiddle with the image file and post the results when I&#39;m done.  <BR> <BR>About
    the tutorials.... thanks for the info. Great tips there. I even made a sticky
    out of the second post with all those tips/tricks. They will surely come in handy
    when I get deep into layout mode. <BR> <BR>Daniel,  <BR> <BR>The &#34;Architecture
    Publication...&#34; line is ALL CAPS, in a font called ADMUI3SM &#40;I have no
    clue where I got this font&#41;. I usually tend to favor non-italics over italics,
    but I&#39;m willing to try anything and see what sticks. I do see your point about
    the lack of &#34;human-ness&#34; of the cover.  <BR> <BR>About the square format...
    I sent the printer a request for a price quote and I specified the size of the
    mag. I have a price quote from a different printer that was made about 8 months
    ago and they didn&#39;t seem too concerned about the size &#40;which has always
    been 8.5&#34; x 8.5&#34;&#41;, so I&#39;m not expecting this one to be concerned
    either.  <BR> <BR>In any case, the mag will only be 40 pages long, perfect bound,
    and we&#39;re only doing a run of 500. The way I see it is this: conceptually
    we would be paying for a publication that is 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; &#40;which would
    be an 11&#34; x 17&#34; spread folded in half, printed on both sides to make up
    four pages&#41; but we are requesting that the printer chops off 2.5&#34; in height
    for every 11&#34; x 17&#34; sheet of paper.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure how they
    work at printing facilities, but I don&#39;t think the mag would be inherently
    more expensive at 8.5&#34; x 8.5&#34; than it would be at 8.5&#34; x 11&#34;.
    Worst case scenario is that they will want to charge us for the chopping/trimming,
    which doesn&#39;t sound too unreasonable, I guess. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still waiting
    for the second printer to get back to me with the quote. After I see how much
    they want to charge, I&#39;ll see if it&#39;s worth me trying to negotiate a better
    deal or if it&#39;s just best to go with the first printer I contacted.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, we&#39;re distributing the mag in school so mailing is not our primary
    concern. I&#39;m sure at some point we will have to mail some issues out to someone
    somewhere, but when that happens I think sticking the mag in an 8.5&#34; x 11&#34;
    compliant packaging shouldn&#39;t be a problem either. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Susana, <BR>If you were printing from large wood type &#40;the kind of effect
    you have&#41;, the texture of the distressing wouldn&#39;t expand as the type
    grew larger but remain at the same size as the smaller type, it will be a challenge
    to apply the texture in a convincing style but ultimately worthwhile. <BR>Depending
    on your printer they would probably print your magazine spreads on larger format
    paper 2 or 4 spreads per sheet, I am not certain about US printers but in Britain
    it would be one of the SRA formats <a href="http://thesaurus.maths.org/mmkb/entry.html"

    but as you say if you have a quote that is acceptable the mechanics shouldn&#39;t
    concern you too much. <BR>For some reason that link won&#39;t appear properly

  body: Susana, your cover is a full bleed that means its not printing 8.5 x 8.5 its
    really printing &#40;if you don&#39;t bleed the back cover&#41; 8.625 x 8.75,
    you have to have safety with a full bleed trim. If you have the budget then its
    not a problem. All I was suggesting is to make sure first, then design against
    the budget. There is a reason you don&#39;t see alot of square publications and
    that is because of paper loss. You aren&#39;t printing many so its probably not
    an issue.

    <BR>there are some distressed fonts here, but I don&#39;t believe any will help
    because they all have the same limitations. I would start with a &#34;proper&#34;
    font like Helvetica Condensed or Impact and then distress them so that you will
    be working at the scale you intend to use it. If you print out a sheet of paper
    with black toner on it and attack it with a scalpel, try various solvents, scrunch
    it up and flatten it out, drag it on the floor, scan it to a high resolution and
    use the outlines of the font to make a mask. I preferred the subtitle in the previous
    versions, I don&#39;t think the more mannered ones work well with your bold concept.
    The stencil is too military for my taste, but again you could make a stencil spray
    it and scan the result, as a rule of thumb, if you make your texture or stencil
    at the size you will finally use it, you will need to scan it at at least 300dpi
    &#40;the higher the better&#41;. <BR>Tim

    to create the distressed look. Here is how it works, &#40;in Photoshop&#41;  you
    take any type you like and it creates a layer mask with the distressing on the
    mask, the type isn&#39;t actually harmed. You might create that effect yourself,
    and then you could play with different typefaces.

    loose the digital type. When &#39;grunge&#39; type is blown up at that size, the
    digitial artifacts just scream at you.  <BR> <BR>If you can find a letterpress
    person in town, have them print out some wood type for you. If not, print out
    some clean type on a lazer printer. Then crumple the paper, run it through the
    wash, scratch it up, photocopy it a few times, etc. <BR> <BR>That said, I&#39;m

    <BR> <BR>darrel,  <BR> <BR>The reason why I wanted to go with that kind of dirty
    look is because of the name of the mag. Architecture studios tend to be dirty,
    messy, scratched up, etc. There;s graffiti on the walls and oil paint on the floor,
    mice walking around, a ketchup stain from 1982 and a trash can with more trash
    around it than inside it. This dirtiness provides the backdrop against which we
    design our &#34;clean&#34; models and drawings for presentation. The mag is another
    studio, one that looks very dirty and messy but that produces clean, beautiful
    drawings/models.  <BR> <BR>Another round of postings will happen soon.  <BR> <BR>Thanks,  <BR>Susana.
