body: 'First, I''m not sure if this is the correct subcategory of the forums for my
  request, but here goes: I''m interested employing Avant Garde for a side project.
  Since this would only be a masthead, I''m drawing it vector, which is no problem.
  Although there are many out there who''ll disagree with the decision to use this
  oft misused font, but, like I said, I''m concerned with accuracy, for accuracy''s
  sake, in specific regard to the ligatures. Any help is greatly appreciated.'

  body: "Not sure what your question is - and this probably belongs in the Design
    forum. Personal opinion: the TR ligature is fine, but the TI is problematic since
    Avant Garde doesn't have serifs - your serif in the \"I\" feels forced. I like
    the bottom one better, the C is more interesting.\r\n\r\nIt is readable and I
    like the use of ligatures for that name TRACTION."

      is this? WWHLD? (What would Herb Lubalin do?)

  body: "I've moved this thread because I think it needs critiquing not ID'ing. This
    is fun to see someone creating their own ligatures. I personally love Avant Garde
    and the wacky alternates. Anyone that doesn't can jump in a lake.\r\n\r\nJust
    like spice, a little goes a long way. I think the TR lig works, but I wonder if
    you could do a version only using the CT lig? The TI lig isn't working at all.
    I have a hunch you might be best off just using the TR lig. \r\n\r\nNice."

    but the CT is original, I believe. It seems to follow the aesthetic, so I think
    it's okay. What do you think?\r\nPattyFab,\r\nYou're right about the \"i\"\r\nThanks."

    lb. coffee table sized book with the early ITC typeface specimens.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a whole slew of uppercase ligatures that were designed. When ITC released
    typefaces to licensed font manufacturers, each manufacturer developed fonts using
    their standard complement. Special characters, swash and alternate characters
    would be offered on another font... IF they were released at all.\r\n\r\n"

    to instill a higher sense of design awareness. Concentrating on style and unity
    and less on type of bike or difference. (BMX, Mountain Bike, Courier, Wheelie
