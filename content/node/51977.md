body: "Continuing my policy of NLLB I'm working on adding in italics for Coru\xF1a
  in the Cyrillic block.  I've already finished the standard cyrillic but I'm stumped
  on whether there are changes in the italic forms for certain older letters and if
  so what they might be.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, the yat while normally looking like
  a b with a bar, turns into a shape more like an n with a loop.\r\n\r\nI figure many
  might not have changes, but since Cyrillic has some of the large changes like Latin
  best to check with the experts."

    don't seem to show up in most fonts anyways like \u04A8 I don't have any samples
    for them in italic.  Almost all the komi letters I'm quite clueless on how to
    do in italic.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos

  body: I believe that the Komi letters are not necessary, as they haven't been used
    since the 1930s and before that were only current for about a decade.

  body: "I did see that, part of it went with the type of descender used (I asked
    a question on that a while back because only some times it seems like the descenders
    are contrasting and if there was a logic or to whether it got a right-sided-,
    left-sighted-, spiked-, or cedilla- style descender though it seems like no one
    really knew) \r\n\r\nAnd yeah I know they're not used.  But, I'm trying to be
    complete, since I'm one of the freaks who uses the odd character that tends to
    never be available I figure I might as well make sure it doesn't happen to anyone
    with my font.  (and of course the standard \"learning experience\" from it all
    :) )\r\n\r\nAlthough rereading over the errata, while it mentions that some are
    changes due to current taste (the e with the tag and descender thingy) and others
    due to style consistency (uk lig), the broad omega changed but I'm not sure what
    the reason is for it.... the beautiful omega keeps the old open style while the
    others have changed to the W style.  Is the open style wrong or is it simply a
    readjestment for stylistic purposes?\r\n\r\nI guess I can just go ahead and make
    guesses and post the results ... for most I suppose I'll just do them inclined
    with the more italic style curved terminals etc and see how that works.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
