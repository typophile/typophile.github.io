  I would like to thank Eben Sorkin of Sorkin Types for his input because without
  him frankly it would not have happened.  "

  body: "It's tempting to critique this existing version (for example pointing out
    that the spacing is pretty rough) but maybe it's too late, so you'd rather we
    focus on the making of a \"print version\" (which BTW is an interesting way of
    looking at things).\r\n\r\nThe x-height is indeed too big (for normal-size text*)
    in relation to the ascenders and the caps, but not the descenders; what I'm getting
    at is that you generally need to have the ascenders longer than the descenders,
    and your descenders are fine. Since it's better to avoid messing with the Em space
    I'd say the best approach would \"simply\" be to reduce the x-height; the ascenders
    would then be given more to room to participate in reading, and the caps wouldn't
    look so unusually short (which besides being ungainly is bad for skimming a text
    for proper names, plus creates confusion with ones that have lc-similar structures).
    First thing though: decide on what point size you're shooting for.\r\n\r\n* It's
    fine for very small sizes (where it would need to be looser though) and for large
    sizes (with some refinement of details). Some people think large sizes should
    have small x-heights, but many uses of large type do in fact favor generous proportions
    (think of newspapers for one).\r\n\r\nBesides the vertical proportions, you really
    do need to get the spacing right - it's key to comfortable reading. Things like
    the way \"toxic\" sets above are bad news.\r\n\r\nItalics: looking at the Roman
    I guess I would have to recommend a pretty classic cursive style; just do me a
    favor and at least give a non-descending \"f\" a shot. :-)  Or you could look
    at something like Eidetic Neo* or even 21012Headline** for inspiration...\r\n\r\n*

    when you do make a print version make sure not to give it away! Or at most give
    away one weight to entice people to buy the rest.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I like non descending italic fs and I like non kerning fs. An example of this
    is Trump Italic which is as you know a masterpiece.  I mean the original the new
    Linotype version has kerning fs.
