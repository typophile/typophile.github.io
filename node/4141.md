  body: I paid for the membership a week ago and have just sent a message to Jared,
    I understand that they are in this only for love to the art but it would be nice
    to recieve an email telling that your registration went ok and when and how will
    things happen, specially if they are goning to be slow.

  body: Sure, I appreciate that this isn&#39;t really a business and as such things
    take time. I don&#39;t care about recieving my stuff in the mail, that arrives
    when it arrives. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just assuming there&#39;s a problem &#40;or
    I made a mistake&#41;. You paid a week ago and your membership appears to be upgraded.
    I paid a month ago and mine isn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>What email address did you use?

  body: My membership took a bit of time &#40;and eventually some prodding&#41;. It
    really has to do with the Punchcut guys and whether they&#39;re busy with their
    actual jobs. Give them some time, and a <i>considerate</i> email. They&#39;ll
    get to it. <BR> <BR>Although I still havent&#39; gotten my T-shirts... <BR> <BR>Also,
    &#40;now that we&#39;re on the topic&#41; what&#39;s the deal with the Typophile
    email address? How does one use this benefit?

  body: The typophile email is an alias- meaning you can place it in your &#34;reply-to&#34;
    field in your email client and/or give it out to friends and family.. But being
    an alias, you&#39;ll still need your original email account. Emails sent to &#40;yourname&#41;@typophile.com
    will automatically be sent on to your actual email address. If you set it up right,
    you&#39;d be the only one who knew that your actual email address was something
    other than typophile.com. <BR> <BR>Hector, Benjie, I&#39;ve seen your emails,
    but am not always able to respond right away. Apologies if you felt left hanging.
    <BR> <BR>Benjie, your account&#39;s been upgraded for Uppercase, and <a href="mailto:benjie@typophile.com">benjie@typophile.com</a>
    forwards to you.  <BR> <BR>Hector, your account&#39;s been fixed, and <a href="mailto:hector@typophile.com">hector@typophile.com</a>
    has been set up for some time now. Sorry for the mixup. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll send
    a private email to both of you regarding some additional details.  <BR> <BR>Chris,
    I&#39;ll follow up with you via email as well. <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks to you both
    for supporting Typophile! Your membership packets will go out in our next batch,
    which, if all goes according to plan, will be Friday. <BR>
