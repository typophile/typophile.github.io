  is also a vintage/retro/art deco feel to this font that seems appropriate (earhart's

    about three projects/presentations about her by the time I got to sixth grade,

    and adorable about the little serifs that make me think of his mustache.\r\n\r\nFor

    But I understand about liking it.\r\n\r\nEccentric really does suit Charlie Chaplin.
    Right down to how the exaggerated x-height mimics his pants being belted up far
    too high."

    something pretty, but powerful. After doing a little research, I knew I wanted
    a mix between her signature and these two logos from the 50's I found: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Signature_4269.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/HolleyLogo_5013.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Frigidaire_3792.png]\r\nAfter
    searching high and low for a typeface, I narrowed it down to these two: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BickleyScrpitPlain_3800.png]
    Bickley Script Plain and [img:sites/default/files/old-images/OPTICarmellaHandScript_5783.png]
    OPTICarmella Hand Script. I think I'm going to have to go with the latter though.
    It has a strong \"M\" and the stroke is thick enough so it won't fade into the
    background, giving it strength. The typeface has the 50's feel I was looking for
    and is in red like Monroe's famous shade of lipstick. Marilyn Monroe and OPTICarmella
    Hand Script are strong and seductive while remaining feminine."

    with the classical artists and therefore we spent many lessons learning their
    backgrounds and studying their musical compositions. To represent Mozart, I chose
    ChopinScript. Its flowing and beautiful strokes are reminiscent of hand drawn
    music notes. Each letter flows into the next as if it is dancing across the page.
    The typeface is both intricate and delicate, just as Mozart's music is played
    and heard. I left his name in black to stay true to the black and white of both
    the piano keys and the music sheets that go hand in hand with one another. While
    it is not my everyday choice of music, I think its important to study the classics
    of any genre, and having played the piano for a number of years I came to respect
    and appreciate the time and effort that each artist puts into their work. \r\n\r\n\r\nJess[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mozart_2_6548.jpg]"

    the past Ella's name is written in fonts similar to Broadway. However, these bulky
    fonts are not characteristic to Ella Fitzgerald Jazz legend. When I think of Ella,
    I think of velvet melting you with her words of love. I think of someone who is

    anything different.\r\n\r\nI decided to use the font Cornet Mtd Std Bold. As you

    those of you who have no clue who Josephine Baker was, she was an entertainer
    from the 1920s and 30s, and the first black international superstar. She was a
    very versatile entertainer and an amazing performer. She was very feminine, elegant,
    and sensual but she was also a very strong woman with attitude who stood up for
    her beliefs. She refused to play for segregated audiences and because of that
    Las Vegas night clubs became integrated. She was very popular in Paris.\r\n\r\nA
    font that I think matches Miss Baker perfectly is Parisian. Like Josephine, I
    think it and elegant and sensual typeface with it's thin and curvilinear strokes
    but at the same time strong and bold with it's thick and straight strokes. Now
    some may wonder why I chose pink for a color? It is very simple, for one of the
    first dances that Josephine performed in Paris her costume was nothing more than
    a girdle/ corset covered in pink feathers.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/josephine_baker_3781.jpg]\r\n\r\nSRB"

    Serif Small Caps to represent one of my favorite movie stars Bette Davis. I knew
    I wanted a condensed serif typeface, that stood strong and regal. I didn't want
    a typeface that was too dated, because of the progressive roles that she was awarded.
    Granted the typeface was designed in the 90's, Bodega Serif has an older feel
    that would fit in during during her earlier acting years. I left it black and
    white, because I believe that her only roles were in black in white."

    Wright. FLW is arguably one of the best architects in history and much of his
    aesthetic involved almost dangerously long cantilevers. So, in looking for a font,
    I wanted one with long/wide serifs that seemed to cantilever off their stems.
    In Modern No. 20, the first thing I noticed was the capital \"F\". It looked like
    as if it was any wider it would topple over. And I chose the color brown because
    of his work was organic: incorporating nature and the environment into his designs.\r\n

    Streep is someone that I have admired for a very long time because of her ability
    to achieve a successful career as well as to raise four children.  Through her
    movies, it is easy to see her class as well as her kind personality.  In interviews
    she is witty and funny, and has a strong opinion about everything (and is not
    afraid to voice it).  Though she recognizes her success, she is not overly outward
    about it and is very modest.  \r\n\r\nI picked Minion Pro Regular to represent
    Meryl.  It is simple yet classy.  With its elegant serifs and variety of thick
    and thin lines, I think that it represents the professionalism and accomplishment
    that is found in Meryl.  It's uniquely formed serifs and terminals make it special
    in the world of font, as Meryl's talent and beauty makes her special in the world
    of acting.  Because she wears mostly blues, grays, and whites to award ceremonies

    with my mother and then they both shared it with me. I've been listening to Elvis'
    music ever since I was a little girl and I still love it. His sound and style
    was very unique because of his diverse musical influences like country, pop, gospel,
    and R&B music. Elvis challenged the social and racial barriers of the time, he
    ushered in a whole new era of American music and popular culture. His talent,
    good looks, sensuality, charisma, and good humor endeared him to millions. He
    is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular
    culture. I think Eccentric Std is a good typeface to represent him. Eccentric
    was designed in 1881 by Gustav F. Schroeder. Eccentric is an all-capital, narrow
    display face with high horizontal cross-bars and main junctures more than halfway
    up the letter forms. It has a tall look which reminds me of a microphone stand.
    Also, Elvis was tall and a singer that performed on a stage with a microphone.
    Eccentric looks edgy and classic at the same time. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Elvis_5118.jpg]"

    It has that Batman/Gotham City feel to it. It is sort of a classy font, kind of
    an old style. It also reminds me of time of Dick Tracy or Roger Rabbit, which
    fits perfectly with this font or even sort of a 1930s, swing dance, chain wallet,
    top hat wearing feel. I guess I chose George Clooney because his character fits
