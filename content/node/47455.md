body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI'm working on a minor update to my design co.'s logotype.
  \r\n\r\nOriginally my goal was to improve its look and legibility at small sizes,
  but upon recommendation from a very talented type designer friend, I revisited the
  form of the tail on the Q \"to play up its weird, organic shape, to balance it better
  with the \"O\" part, and by extension balance the Q better with the A.\" as he put
  it.\r\n\r\nWhat I did to the Q tail:\r\n* Heavier at bottom\r\n* Curvier curves\r\n*
  Tail extends deeper into the center of the O\r\n* A little longer\r\n* Added a bit
  of flatness to the pointy ends\r\n\r\nThe total effect seems to feel more calligraphic,
  definitely clearer\r\nat smaller sizes. I worry I lost a tiny dash of the personality
  of the\r\noriginal \"slug\", but maybe that can be reasserted, or maybe it's not\r\nsuch
  a big deal.\r\n\r\nIf I stick with this direction, it seems like the A needs a bit
  of\r\n\"dressing up\" to match. Especially after adding that vertical flatness\r\nto
  the sides of the Q's tail's tips, the current contrast with the Q\r\nmakes the A
  feel even more like a plain-jane rounded sans.\r\n\r\nSo, how am I doing? Any suggestions
  on the \"A\"? Leave it alone? The original was better? "

  body: How about extending the tail of the Q all the way through the left of the
    Q, continually, across the 'A' to make the bridge in the 'A' itself..one long
    swoop. This may give it the character you're looking for...

  body: "Hi Oberl\xE4nge,\r\n\r\nThat's an interesting idea, but I don't think I'm
    looking to make such a dramatic change at this point. For now it's more about
    balance and legibility."

  body: "Hey, what's up cpalmieri...I understand where you're coming from. I do like
    the second version; the Q seems more pronounced with the height of the tail extending
    more into the inside. I also like the cleanliness and legibility when it's scaled
    down. Have you tried to make the bottom of the right side of the A curl towards
    the Q just a bit for balance between the two letters? Good luck with everything,
    I know how frustrating it can be.  I would like to see what you come up with...\r\n\r\n"
