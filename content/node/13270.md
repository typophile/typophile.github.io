  body: "<em>I dont want to sound too harsh, but.:</em> So what you basically did
    yet is set two words, using pretty 'standard', common typefaces <em>( Like Helvetica,
    News or Trade Gothic )</em>.? I am not too sure about that being very unique,
    or memorable, what about you.? This could be for everything.. You could have tried
    to slightly customize / modify these typefaces.. But, I think you may want to
    return to sketching and scribbling various ideas on paper ( again ), instead of
    starting out with setting type on screen..\r\n\r\nWhat may help you as well is
    seeing what other airlines did, and what their logos look like.:\r\n<em>> <a href=\"http://www.aerosite.net/logos.htm\"

    have the opportunity to find a new name and create a new brand for an airline.?

    startup airline company with no name? It's not a logo that needs to be done, but
    an entire branding campaign.\r\n\r\nI think you need to answer formlos' question
    before getting advice.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm being re-branded!"

  body: "I rarely venture into critique of type <strong>usage</strong>, but...\r\n\r\n1)
    That lc \"a\" is not \"standard\", it's Barbarella. Try something like Kievit*
    instead.\r\n2) For the \"airways\" I think all-caps is good, but something smaller,
    wider, looser and darker.\r\n3) For a logo, what about a pennant shape? Since
    \"standard\" also means flag, and the pennant is associated with wind.\r\n4) Yeah,
    totally nail down the name first! :-/  Not to mention the target clientele, etc.\r\n\r\n*

  body: "Branding an airline is one of the most difficult tasks for a designer. Mostly
    it's a team of designers who work on the first ideas for weeks. Designing every
    single unit, from badges to counters, from wingtips to guidebooks, that's a very
    intense job which takes months, even years.\r\nThere are examples of very basic
    low-budget airliners (Easy Jet, Ryanair...), but still they are very clever designs,
    using very common type like Cooper or Helvetica Extended, and it works. You don't
    want a low-budget liner looking too fancy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, good luck with it..."

  body: 'First thing I agree with Kyle this looks like a school project. If you intend
    to use the logo as signage think of a stop sign. It is knocked out type from a
    bright solid color. There is a reason for this, its because its visible from a
    far distance. The same think but opposite for a yeild sign (black type against
    a bright yellow background). In both cases the type has to be bold to be seen
    at a distance. Airline, distance get it, the thin type doesn''t work. '
