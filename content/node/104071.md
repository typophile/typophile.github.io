  but a more narrow version - any suggestion what might be an alternative and were
  to get that (for free?). Please let me know about any ideas where to get that.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nChristina"

  body: "<blockquote>Relatively speaking of course. :-)</blockquote>\r\nAgree. I'd
    rather have said \"free legal fonts\" even if I really consider many of them as
    quality ones. For the rest, everybody has his own expectations and standards.
    To me, any original (legitimate) work deserve respect, free or not, (technically)
    bad or not. And I don't want to start again the endless discussion about what's
    \"good\" what's not :) Quoting yourself from a recent discussion, don't forget
    \"[...] one man's nice is another man's goddam dog's breakfast.\" "
