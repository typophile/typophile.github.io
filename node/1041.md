  body: Thanks Dmitry.  Now that I haven&#39;t looked at this for 8 hours I see what
    you mean about the W.  Is it the top left serif that makes it look unbalanced?  I&#39;d
    to maintain that serif, but it does need some work. <BR> <BR>Hmmmm.  Not sure
    what to do.

  body: My favorite chars are the Z and the W because they are the most original.
    Could you take the &#34;irregularity&#34; that exists in the W and the notch that
    is the Z and translate that into the whole word?

  body: Tiffany, <BR> <BR>That is exactly what I want to achieve.  I tried that with
    the R, there is a notch &#40;albeit subtle&#41; on the diagonal.  I guess that
    needs to fleshed out some more? <BR> <BR>Before I had the crossbar on the A not
    meet, as well as the left side of the W separate from the right.  But I didn&#39;t
    want to go the &#39;stencil&#39; route.  <BR> <BR>I will do some more &#39;notching&#39;
    and repost, but does the W seem awkward in terms of balance to you &#40;or anyone
    else&#41;?  I want the basic letterforms to be solid before I start embellishing
    them. <BR> <BR>

  body: I like Z a lot too, Peter. Maybe if you make the notch &#40;or &#34;crotch&#34;&#41;
    in the R a bit bigger, it&#39;ll lighten up the joint in the middle. I think that&#39;s
    one of the reasons it looks so much darker. I also think the reason the W seems
    unbalanced is the difference between the two apertures at the top - and the counter
    space. The left counter is much smaller and has a smaller aperture. Maybe it&#39;d
    help to widen it some.

  body: looks like you&#39;ve forgot to round out the corner bezier on the connector
    there to the top right serif on M.  <BR> <BR>Its a yummy Z, I&#39;d make the notch
    in the R the same as Z for consistency <BR> <BR>yep, I&#39;ll say it too - the
    R is a bit thick in comparison to the rest. Looks like you might need a hairline
    planned out like you do in the M, A, K and W. <BR> <BR>in fact wait a second -
    you might want to make all those hairlines appear the same thickness come to think
    of it. <BR> <BR>The A looks uncentered. think the apex should shift a bit more
    to the right. <BR> <BR>yep that&#39;s it.

  body: Generally it&#39;s a bad idea to mix two similar faces.  Either use a sans
    or a script for the &#34;photographs&#34; but don&#39;t use a Serif face for it.  Unless
    you want to expand your little alphabet to include the letters in &#34;photographs&#34;
    too.

  body: Peter, I prefer the sans as well. However, I think you need something geometric.
    -- The spacing in Mark Zarnow is off. The two words need less word spacing, and
    then you need to work with the separate letter spaces more as well. I do like
    the changes you&#39;ve made to the forms themselves.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    it&#39;s a bad idea to mix two similar faces  <BR>&#62;I think you need something
    geometric.  <BR> <BR>I.e., use a sans serif, but a sans like Gill is still too
    close to classical letterforms &#40;too much like MARK ZARNOW&#41;. Hence Tiffany&#39;s
    suggestion of a geometric. Well, I think - I certainly don&#39;t want to misrepresent
    anyone. <BR> <BR>One thing about the letters in MARK ZARNOW: the &#34;R&#34; is
    still too heavy to my eyes. Is it possible to widen it slightly - or make the
    tail thinner &#40;more like &#34;K&#34;&#41; - in order to create more counterspace?'
