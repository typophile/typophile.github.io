  body: Might be <a href=http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html>Avenir
    Next</a>. And the designer could have customized it a bit (e.g. the terminals
    of the C).

  body: Good call on the Avenir family. To be more specific on which font was customized
    though, it appears most likely to be <a href="http://www.linotype.com/90805/avenirnextdemi-font.html">Avenir
    Next Demi</a>.

  body: "It's really close. The RUBI looks like Avenir Next with some very minor structural
    differences (the leg on the R starts farther out in the original and has a different
    angle, the curves of the U are flatter, the upper bowl on the B is shorter). What
    could cause that?\r\n\r\nThe CON, though, looks a lot more like Myriad than Avenir,
    with some alteration on the C.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtf_3496.png]<em>Top:

    don't have Gotham Narrow. :("
