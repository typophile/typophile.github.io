  the text doesnt really bring anything new, I'm quite amazed by the fact that most
  of these handwritings are, for me, not very nice or skillfull. I personnally like
  Erik Spiekermann's the most, and actually that's about the only one I fall for in
  the list. Also, having studied body language and graphology in the far past, it's
  always very interesting to see this kind of things... It's a shame that people are
  losing the habit to use a pen, damned keyboard.\r\n\r\ndr"
