    why I like Monotype Baskerville so much. I simply have no taste, preferring the
    artificial, the homogenized, to the genuine and authentic."

  body: Nothing beats Monotype Baskerville in metal. If you look at a mid-century
    technical book set in Mono Baskerville 12 pt with 10 pt for indented quotes, you
    drool over the utter even-ness of colour, impossible to attain with any digital
    type except Sumner Stone's Cycles. The transition from size to size seems to have
    been particularly well done in Mono Baskerville, at least in those key sizes.

  body: "I have a couple of books at home set in metal Monotype Baskerville and yes,
    it looks great. But speaking of digital interpretations, it seems to be a shared
    opinion that the best versions available now are Franti\u0161ek \u0160torm's (Storm
    Type Foundry) and Lars Bergquist's (Fountain), for variuos reasons: the degree
    of authenticity towards the original model and the full OpenType features, among
    them. Besides a (not so) slightly different designs, these two versions vary for
    the weights/styles offer: Storm's features text display sizes, medium and bold
    weights (+ italics), small caps related figures, greek and cyrillic alphabets,
    while Bergquist's has roman and italic (and small caps), as a more faithful approach
    to the original \"period design\". They differ in price too, but both look like
    very strong and functional interpretations. It is interesting to note, by the
    way, how many different versions of the typeface has been produced, and how *really*
    different they look from one another. Here are some links:\r\n\r\nStorm Type Foundry:\r\nhttp://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-114-baskerville-original-pro\r\n\r\nFountain:\r\nhttp://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/baskerville-1757/\r\n\r\nSo
    many Baskervilles:\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=Baskerville&q=Go\r\n"
