body: "What are your methods of [[kerning]] glyphs in a pair with the [[space]] glyph?
  \r\nI would like to kern at least letters like A,T,V,Y,Z,v,y,z,?,1,2,5. \r\nDo you
  use wider range of pairs (eg. including other spacemen like f,t,w,x,4,7 etc.)? \r\nI
  suppose it isn't just mechanical removing the sidebearing's value. \r\nDo you use
  any control set, eg. \"n_n\" to compare the amount of light?"

    you are going to do it for capitals, it's a good idea to substitute \"space.caps\"
    that is wider than the default space, in \"calt\", to improve the look of all-cap
    setting.\r\n\r\nI don't think it really improves colour, and can be really nasty
    if a typographer uses H&Js that reduce wordspace.\r\n\r\nMyriad has this feature,
    which is part of its really tight set. In general, it is very very slick, but
    it does fail occasionally, and it looks like the space hasn't been set, a typo. "

  body: Does creating a contextual space character work with InDesign? I had tried
    doing some contextual space work a while back and found it worked fine with Illustrator,
    but it seemed InDesign had its own space settings that override those programmed
    in the font.

    like this:\r\n\r\nH | H\r\nA | A\r\nT | T\r\nV | V\r\n\r\nThis way, I can compare
    /H space H/ against problematic letters."

    seen books where the pair was too tight and the space just disappeared any time
    a line was tight."

  body: "You also need to think not just in terms of pairs, but triplets. Consider
    kerning \"space\" \"W\". Now consider what happens if a lower-case \"f\" precedes
    the space, as in \"If Westmoreland had only . . .\"\r\n\r\nI just rekerned a font
    where, amongst other things, the comma-quoteright kerning was so tight that the
    string f+comma+quoteright had the quote overprinting the terminal of the \"f\".
    Or another font where A+quoteright+comma was kerned so much that the comma overprinted
    the right arm of the \"A\". I know, none of these involve spaces; the point is
    to think in terms of the effect of pairs kerning in three+ letter situations."
