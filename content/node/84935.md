    readability, like medium (paper or monitor), light, colour (ink) et cetera. \r\n\r\nKeep
    it no smaller than 9 points, no bigger than 12."

  body: 'The scientific article by Legge and Bigelow linked in [[http://typophile.com/node/84429|this
    typophile thread]] addresses this and will give you a detailed answer. If I remember
    rightly, below .2 degrees of visual angle for the x-height seems to be a limit
    for fluent reading. Since x-height varies with typeface, the minimum point size
    can vary a lot with typeface. '

  body: A decently crafted typeface of the classical style should be well-reading
    at 3 points for shorter texts, at 8 or 9 pt.s for longer ones.

  body: Remember that the smaller the type is set, the wider, the lower the stroke
    contrast, the higher the x-height, and wider the spacing should be. These aspects
    help legibility and readability at small sizes. They are called optical size,
    and only very few typefaces have these.

  body: "I think Andreas's number of 3 points for short text is generally too low
    if you are talking about reading with comfort. The article of Legge and Bigelow
    give a range of 4 to 40 points as the general \"fluent\" range, but that includes
    I think very large x-heights, as the visual angle is more precisely .2 to 3 degrees
    for fluent reading. They give several convenient conversion methods, including
    that visual angle at 40 cm (16 inches) is point size divided by 20. \r\n\r\nThe
    x height of Adobe Garamond is a little less than .4 of the point size, and working
    from that I get 10 point as the smallest fluent reading size (.2 degrees visual
    angle of x-height) for Adobe Garamond. They define \"fluent\" as being able to
    read at maximum speed. Of course you can decipher letters at much smaller sizes
    than that if you stare at them in very bright light. But that's different from
    reading fluently, and with comfort.\r\n\r\nTo me that 10 point minimum of comfort
    for Adobe Garamond seems reasonable. Now typefaces designed for reading below
    10 point normally have a larger x-height, so I would expect that Garamond Premier,
    which has optical sizes, could go smaller for the 'caption' optical size. By comparison,
    Minion \"caption,\" which is intended for small sizes, has an x-height of 438
    em units (of 1000). That pushes the fluent reading size down to about 9 point.
    I'm sure you can read it, maybe not at maximum speed, at 8 point. But 3 point?
    That's getting to the stare-and-decipher level, if you can even make it out. "

  body: ">median age\r\n\r\nWell, not just median age, but the fact that most material
    is going to have readers over 45. Everyone over 45 has some limitation because
    of presbyopia and need for brighter light. So aided with glasses or not, larger
    type is going to be welcome for us old folks. So design not just for those with
    the best sight, but those with normal vision affected by age. Having 10 or 11
    point type rather than 8 or 9 is not going to slow young people down, and is going
    to be a benefit for the older readers."

  body: "> larger type is going to be welcome for us old folks\r\n\r\nTotally agree;
    as I've gotten older it's harder and harder to read tiny type. \r\n\r\nAnd don't
    forget that some younger folks have bad eyesight. I have a friend in her 20s who
    has very poor eyesight, but most of her friends are totally unaware of it since
    she wears contacts and doesn't like to discuss it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have to think that \"3 points\" is simply a typo. I cannot imagine a typeface,
    however well-crafted, being readable except with difficulty at that size. Perhaps
    6 points was meant.\r\n\r\nIn the past, of course, occasionally 4 1/2 points was
    put to use, but that was eye-straining small print... and so was 6 points, for
    that matter, but not as bad.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I have to admit, though, that the rules
    text on Yu-Gi-Oh! cards seems to be smaller than 6 points. So sizes below 6 points
    still see some use, even today."

    to make out the difference between letters and dirt at that size.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    it's a completely impractical size and not worth worry about unless a client with

  body: "Note that the question in this thread is the smallest size for *comfortable*
    reading. The recent paper of Legge and Bigelow that I've referenced is about \"fluent\"
    reading ranges, which measure reading speed. So the ability to decipher 2 point
    type doesn't address that. In general, according to that paper the fluent range
    of type is twice the size of the minimum visual acuity. \r\n\r\nThe one who measured
    visual comfort, or visual fatigue, was Matthew Luckiesh, as explained in [[http://typophile.com/node/83684|this
    thread.]] Luckiesh's work lay fallow for 60 years, and needs repeating, but as
    I remember he found large type to be more comfortable, with 12 point being generally
    more comfortable than 10 point. This was as measured by increase in blink rate,
    with the lower blink rates over time indicating more comfort and less fatigue.\r\n\r\np.s.
    note that caps are going to be decipherable at smaller sizes, probably around
    half the size of lower case, as generally the vertical visual arc will be at or
    above the .2 degrees down to a far smaller size.     "

  body: "The Legge-Bigelow paper spoke of type size defined by the amount of visual
    angle occupied by x-height, which they determined to be about half of the point
    size.\r\n\r\nBut this makes two assumptions.\r\nFirst, that x-height is pretty
    standard relative to point size, and secondly that people hold the document at
    a standard distance.\r\n\r\nObviously, x-height varies; Dante, for instance, has
    a far larger x-height than Garamond (presumably not the ITC version).\r\n\r\nMore
    importantly, it's possible to use much smaller type on smaller pages\u2014people
    will hold the book closer to bump up the angle-size. And this is something that
    those with normal sight can do, as well as the short sighted, who can just remove
    their spectacles and hold the document real close.\r\n\r\nCenturies ago, many
    books were published at \"pocket\" size, with small type. I have many of these,
    and they are a joy to read as I am short-sighted\u2014all I have to do is take
    off my glasses and hold the page six inches away. In fact, this bumps up the angle
    to practically headline proportion, which is a nice way to read letterpress text
    type, for me at least, slowly\u2014and also to marvel at the detail of engraved
    illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
