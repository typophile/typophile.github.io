body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : FF Maiola</strong>\r\n\r\nDesigned by
  [[Veronika Burian]] in 2003-04. Released as a [[FontFont]] in 2005.\r\n\r\n<strong>Notes
  from FSI</strong>\r\n\r\nFF Maiola was born as part of Veronika Burian\u2019s MA
  in Typeface Design at the [[University of Reading]]. Although a contemporary typeface,
  it retains strong links to historical models by implementing old-style features
  and calligraphic forms. Sources of inspiration include Czech type designers [[Oldrich
  Menhart]] and [[Vojtech Preissig]], whose works display both vigor and elegance.
  Still, the intention was not to follow their path, but to define a personal interpretation.
  Maiola bears its idiosyncrasies with care and imparts the concepts of irregularity
  and angularity in a beautifully discrete way.\r\n\r\n[[OpenType]] technology adeptly
  combines typographic features such as small caps, lining and old-style figures,
  both tabular and proportional, ligatures, alternate characters, case-sensitive variants,
  and fractions. In addition to the regular Latin character set, Maiola Pro includes
  Central European, Cyrillic and Monotonic Greek characters.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 FF Maiola
  received the \u201CCertificate of Excellence in Type Design\u201D award from the
  Type Director\u2019s Club ([[TDC]]). \r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a
