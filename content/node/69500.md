  something that is being taught on a second week of a proper type design class...
  which I fully intend to attend at some point later on :)\r\n\r\nI am trying to understand
  the reason for the lower curve of the a's tail not following the geometrically obvious
  path:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_5249.png]\r\n\r\nMy guess is
  that it has to do with the visual balance. The notch is deepened to cut away some
  of the black and improve the uniformity of perceived stroke thickness in that area.
  Am I off?"

  body: "Strokes are generally thinned at oblique intersections.\r\nOtherwise, the
    joint becomes enlarged, and ends up looking bigger than it really is, due to \"bleed\"\r\nBleed
    is of several kinds. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it is a traditional artefact of print typography,
    because these sharp crevasses are apt to fill in with ink.\r\nHence the preemptive
    move of thinning the stroke(s), and even taking it further and enlarging the pit
    as an \"ink trap\".\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is a visual bleed in the perceptual
    process, because the apex of the joint is beyond the threshold of acuity.\r\n\r\nThirdly
    there is categorical or conceptual bleed, which is further up the perceptual chain;
    this occurs because at a joint there is a wider distance of solid than either
    of the stroke widths that comprise it, and this does not appear to be aligned
    with either stroke-- it \"reads\" as a blot or hot spot, visual noise which serves
    no purpose. \r\n\r\nThat third kind is more what happens at the bottom of the
    \"a\".\r\n\r\nLetter forms also suffer shrinkage as well as bleed, at the outside
    of corners.\r\nOr perhaps that could be described as a kind of \"negative\" bleed,
    of the surrounding ground into the figure.\r\nThe serif is the most obvious method
    of dealing with shrinkage, but in phototypography, \"ticks\" were sometimes added
    to corners to prevent the arris from becoming rounded. Even in a sans, the end
    of a stroke is often widened and sharpened, as at the top left of the \"a\" above,
    to counteract shrinkage. "
