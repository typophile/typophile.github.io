  inpiration are from constructivism typography style. Injoy the little sample to
  take an idea.

  body: ' Ricardo, <BR> <BR>The face has the essence of a digital clock, which makes
    it somewhat unique among similar faces. &#40;I&#39;m especially referring to the
    B, K and X.&#41; <BR> <BR>Some of the symbols look awkward. The @  seems unnaturally
    forced and the greater-than and less-than don&#39;t really carry the essence of
    the face. <BR> <BR>Nice work. I like that asterisk the best... <BR> <BR>//joe '

  body: ' Ricardo, <BR> <BR>Joe is right about the @. Perhaps it doesn&#39;t work
    <BR>because the tiny triangles are a shape that isn&#39;t <BR>found anywhere else
    in the font. Why not keep the <BR>symbol squarish to maintain consistency? <BR>
    <BR>While it&#39;s another LCD-digital-clock-calculator <BR>face, I think it&#39;s
    one that hasn&#39;t been done <BR>before. I thought the genre had been thoroughly
    <BR>saturated, but you&#39;ve managed to come up with <BR>something new and appealing.
    Congrats. '

  body: ' I really like the sheared corners. It adds a unique twist to all the blockish
    faces we&#39;ve seen in the past little while. <BR> <BR>I have a few suggestions.
    <BR> <BR>I would revisit the BKR and X. I think that there are some other solutions
    to these that would push it closer to the constructivist influence and further
    from the lcd influence. Maybe you could try dropping in a few diagonals. I like
    the direction you&#39;ve taken with the lc v, for example &#40;the angle on the
    uc V is a little steep, I think&#41;. The S looks a little blocky. Maybe it could
    be a bit narrower. The shoulder on the f seems a little clunky, and could be shortened
    as well as the tail on the j. You could also do the same with the tails of the
    g and the y if you wanted to, but it isn&#39;t really necessary. The uc Q could
    also use a different quill. <BR> <BR>Good luck.  <BR> <BR>cr <BR> <BR>ps. the
    lc a is rad. '
