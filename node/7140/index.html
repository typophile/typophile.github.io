		<div class="commentbody">Sad to say the conference has come to its end, I got quite used to making myself at home here at St Bride (I'm still in the library, the books are keeping very good company). Great lectures, nice exhibits as well, and of course always a pleasure to spend some time with everyone who participated in the event. Especially little Miranda Phinney, who is just the most adorable little person I have ever seen. She was popular with the ladies, that is for sure. Thomas, thanks for bringing her along (as well as Veronica, she is a dear!). <BR> <BR>I'm going to post some photos in a few days after I get back to Vancouver. <BR> <BR>Next year, Temporary Type!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This was one of my favorite conferences ever. It was really quite wonderful. Little 4 1/2-month-old Miranda was quite the hit, and took most everything in good spirits, though the trip seems to have messed up her body clock so we haven't had much sleep. 3-5 hours is not enough, I fear. <BR> <BR>It was a pleasure to meet Jim, though somehow we didn't end up seeing much of each other after our initial meeting. I have a photo of him in a rather amusing pose, however, which I will have to send him. <BR> <BR>It was also interesting to meet one of Typophile's lurkers, the lovely Lisa Pomeroy. I'm starting to realize that there are quite a lot of people who lurk and don't post much, meaning the Typophile community is in some respects much larger than is apparent from just reading posts. <BR> <BR>Yesterday we came out to Reading and I did a three-hour seminar on Unicode and OpenType for the MA Type Design students. It was great fun, and they asked very bright questions. Unfortunately, Veronica must have gotten a bad sandwich at lunch, and seems to have come down with food poisoning last night. So we ended up staying overnight in Reading thanks to the generous hospitality of Mark Barratt and Sue Walker, and I'm now sitting in the Text Matters office (the top floor of their house) catching up on email. <BR> <BR>In London, we have been staying at the Mad Hatter, which was the designated conference hotel. Very reasonably priced, nice enough, good pub downstairs. Currently has rather small beds, but reportedly will be upgrading soon. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So many fun people. Zara and Calliope were both great to hang out with. Unfortunately, lack of sleep started to get the better of me, so I wasn't up to serious partying. <BR> <BR>One unhappy afternote: later the night of my last posting, I got food poisoning, too! Mine was from some dubious Indian take-away by Waterloo station. <BR> <BR>I am mostly better now, and back in Seattle. Food aside, we still give high marks to the Brits for hospitality. Another good example: people would spontaneously offer to help us get the stroller into the Tube station (darn stairs &ndash; most of the underground stations aren't wheelchair/stroller accesisble). <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I protest: I have had some truly great Indian meals in London. I guess you have to know where to go and where to avoid. I can give a list of my favourites to anyone who is interested. I did have a comical experience at Khan's in Bayswater a couple of weeks ago: I took some of the recent Reading graduates for dinner, and after we ordered food we turned to the drinks menu and discovered, to our dismay, that the restaurant has gone 100% halal since my last visit, and no longer serves alcohol. <BR> <BR> <BR>I have fond memories of bookshopping with Laurence in Bath. After a day wandering around the shops, I was happy to have one slim volume in hand: Laurence had six bags full of books, and had made arrangements for a gigantic folio volume to be held until he could arrange to collect it. <BR> <BR>Mind you, I'm currently looking at the three shelf-feet of books I brought back from Prague abd London, wondering where I'm going to put them!</div>
