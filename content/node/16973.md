  guide. \r\nSince it has to be in english and this is not my mother tongue, \r\nI
  need to have some samples. I did a little research, \r\nbut I am not satisfied.
  Also I realized that there is no \r\nstandar terminology. For example I found those
  3 descriptions:\r\nlogo=symbol+signature, Mark=symbol+namestyle and mark=symbol+logotype.
  \r\n\r\nSo if anyone has some good examples please do let me know. \r\n\r\n"

    is a typical corporate style guide (as found by a Google search). Unfortunately,
    typical style guides do not contain the breadth of typographic standards one would
    hope for. I would love to show you some of the comprehensive style guides my agency
    has done, but we're under NDA. ;-)

  body: The last time I did a corporate ID guide it took a year for the research and
    another 6 months to write. The project was well over $200,000 for a small regional
    thrift bank. Its a major project and not something you can do as a cookie cutter
    approach. Each industry has different needs and different uses. Good luck with
    you project.

    all of us. :^)

  body: This is one of those things I've been thinking about for a long time. Of course
    there is never any time to write up things like this. And it's tough when you're
    the only designer at a company. Hopefully someday, after reading up on all this
    stuff from places like this, I'll get to devote some time to creating standardization
    documents. :)
