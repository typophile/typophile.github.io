    from Chank, but that's not quite right.\r\n\r\nAny answers/suggestions greatly
    appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nBrad."

  body: "It looks amazingly like Liquorstore. Except for the Q, of course. And the
    ink traps in the N are bigger here than they are in Liquorstore.\r\n\r\nGot any
    more samples of this?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/liquorstore/"

  body: "That's it. It's supposedly a free download, but when the only page (that
    I can find) to download it is this one:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.antreposhop.com/product/public-gothic-font-family\r\n\r\nSeems
    to be US $115 after adding to cart.\r\n\r\nEdit: the beta version WAS free. Font
    is no longer in beta. But they have left many pages up that advertise it as free,
    which it isn't."
