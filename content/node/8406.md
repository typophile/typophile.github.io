body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m new here, but have been following along for quite some
  time. I&#39;m trying to output a font created in Bitfonter 2, but its name is not
  appearing in the font menu. To create the naming I used the &#34;wizard&#34; button
  &#40;green gem icon&#41; in the Bitfonter menus, which appears to automate some
  naming but its still not appearing. Is there something I&#39;m missing? The font
  name is currently set to WadsSansBold18.  <BR> <BR>Font Book seems to accept and
  preview the font, but I can&#39;t get PhotoShop to notice and/or use it. <BR> <BR>What
  considerations do I need to make sure of in order for a font to appear correctly
  in the font menu? And how can I relate &#40;style-link?&#41; styles of the font
  &#40;say, Regular, Bold&#41; under one font name in the menu? <BR> <BR>Thanks and
  HNY <BR> <BR>Wads
