body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am relatively new to working with fonts and licenses, and have
  come here in the hope somebody can clear things up for me.\r\n\r\nI work as a freelance
  illustrator, and have been asked to design some labels for a small cosmetic company
  - which includes sourcing fonts, something I have not done before. I have found
  2 fonts my client wishes to use on the the labels of their products. I have read
  through the EULA's of both fonts, which for your info are:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bembo/buy.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/packard-new-style/buy.html\r\n\r\nI
  have contacted both foundries already. \r\n\r\nBembo creators are yet to get back
  to me.\r\n\r\nPackard creators phoned up and quizzed me on what the 3 year projected
  income of the client I'm designing the label for was - something as a freelance
  illustrator I am not, and do not want to get involved with. I said I'd get back
  to them. \r\n\r\nI told a fellow designer friend of mine about this, and they said
  I'm over thinking things and buying a Standard End User License will be fine when
  using the fonts on the labels of the clients products.\r\n\r\nHowever I'm unsure;
  I have read through both of their EULA's, and I see mentions of commercial goods
  needing 'Special Font Licenses'. Would this include the fonts being used on the
  labels of the goods? \r\n\r\nThe fonts will be used solely on the product labels,
  and I am planning on supplying the design in a PDF to the printer, which, as I have
  read for both fonts, is within the terms of a Standard End User License.\r\n\r\nI'm
  hoping there is a simple answer to my query, and I am just making it more complicated
  than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any replies\r\n\r\nAnnabel"

    and deliver the printed labels to your client, the fonts themselves are only used
    internally by you, so you should be OK with this licence.\r\n\r\nI think with

  body: For Bembo, internal business use "shall not mean any distribution whatsoever
    of the Font Software or any component or Derivative Work thereof". I would interpret
    that as they're saying you can't distribute the software itself, which seems logical.

    would mind you using one of their fonts in any way at all as long as the font
    itself doesn't get redistributed. Adobe is even in the refreshing minority of
    foundries that allows modification of their fonts.\r\n\r\nIf Red Rooster is restrictive,

  body: "Well, the Bembo EULA makes no mention of end products, only the software,
    and it is hard to imagine they intend to say that a document one prints with that
    font can only be read within the company. For further certainty,  you could buy
    Bembo from Adobe. They say:\r\n\"14.7.1 You may use the font software with the
    Software on Computers as described in Section 2 and output the font software to
    any output device(s) connected to such Computer(s).\" They certainly place no
    restrictions on how you use the printed product.\r\n\r\nRed Rooster, however,
    states:\r\n\"A Special Font License is also required for...commercial merchandising
    and goods for sale, (such as clothing apparel and accessories), physical goods,
    unique branding situations, and any and all other unique or new applications or
    future technologies.\"\r\n\r\nGiven that Red Rooster asked about revenue from
    your client, I think it's safe to say they intend their EULA to be restrictive."

    I agree font licenses are generally badly written, and many of the confusing clauses
    in these licenses are intended to limit the redistribution of the font file itself
    and not its day to day use to make things like labels. \r\n"

    as to what to do !\r\n\r\nI did think Red Rooster looked quite restrictive, and
    wasn't something I wanted to get into as my first step into licensing a font (Thanks
    to John Nolan for suggesting alternatives to Packard). \r\n\r\nI'm going to try
    contacting the Bembo creators again - I'd really like their say-so that it's ok
    to use for my purpose.\r\n\r\nThanks again everyone\r\n\r\n"
