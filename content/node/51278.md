  bit of text for a hooded sweatshirt back design? \r\n\r\nWe need the phrases \"The
  Cure for the Common Workout\" and \"Routine is the Enemy\" printed on the back of
  our hooded sweatshirts and would like someone to design it. \r\n\r\nOur website
  receives 5k visitors per month and we would include a link to your website/portfolio.
  Monetary payment would be possible, but we are a new business and cannot afford
  much. \r\n\r\nEmail me @ Ezekiel@CrossFitCoastal.com if you are interested in working
  on this project thank you!!!\r\n\r\n"
