<p>Make a mockup of some project but make it really badly. Then duplicate the mockup but change the font to something like univers or Akzidenz Grotesk or whatever you want to use. (something closer to helvetica would be easier) *Also modify the new layout to make it the one they will choose!</p>
<p>Then you give it to the decision makers and ask which one they like better. (Or if they know less you can ask which type they like better.) They will probably assume you are talking about the layout difference (not even noticing you changed the type) and (hopefully) choose the one with the font you want to use!</p>
<p>Just get them to sign off on it so when you start using your font you will have their signature to fall back on ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks- see, we have an issue critique next week and i am presenting how the design has changed and where i would like it to go in the future- i work for IN THESE TIMES magazine (<a href="http://www.inthesetiems.com">www.inthesetiems.com</a>) and before I got on board, their design was terrible. I have redesigned basically everything since then, but sometimes I feel like we can go farther with some of the layout- stray from the branded magazine style with our features/culture pieces- and this last issue i fought tooth and nail for it- and I won that battle. its just hard telling someone, no, this will work, just because you haven&rsquo;t been exposed to certain things doesn&rsquo;t mean they are bad&hellip; yada yada. i just fear future design arguments- and want to have a really compelling argument next week during the critique. thanks for any ideas and suggestions!</div>

And it would help to have examples of other magazines/ publications that do the same thing to show them that other people are doing it and it&rsquo;s not a risk but the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Simple and to the point would probably be best, like if on one page you had their design on one side and yours on another and a simple explanation of why yours works better.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">well the basis of my argument is &ldquo;why-design for a reason&rdquo;- which is some of the breakthoughs i have been pushing lately. if there is no justified reason for what is being done based on the content, then it shouldn&rsquo;t be done. the troubles i have root from them not understanding the designed interpretation of their content. For instance, there was a story about funding the left ( what everyone knows but noone will say) in our last issue, so I chose the font Heathen (<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/heathen/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/heathen/</a>) and noone understood and thought it would be non-legible. I used larger similar swashes and swoops on the page as graphic elements that complemented the font- and they asked if i should put money signs in them. eventually, i won the argument. 
I will definitely grab some other magazines that have similar styles and whatnot to the looks and feel i am trying to achieve, but its not easy, as they always refer to other lefty publications (which don&rsquo;t have the greatest design either) oy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Picking your battles is key. If they perceive you as difficult or a prima donna they will be resistant to your ideas whether they are good or not. You may have to concede on smaller points in order to make your larger points and preserve good relations. I always had to teach my design assistants this fact, which runs counter to the idea that you should never compromise your design aesthetic. Fact is, you work for them.</p>
<p>Another tip - put in something you know they&rsquo;ll want to change so you can give them that right away. My old boss for example hated green (how do you hate a color???) so I&rsquo;d put something green in there to let him feel like he was top dog.</p>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating than &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like it&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not there yet&rdquo; but it can be hard to get non-designers to be more specific than that.</p>
<p>You can show them mags like Rolling Stone or Entertainment Weekly (altho in truth I haven&rsquo;t looked at them recently..) which do wildly creative designs in the well but stick to their formulas for the front and backmatter. I don&rsquo;t think it matters if they are in different genres.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The best way to talk to your boss(es) is to talk to your boss(es). I feel for your situation. Here&rsquo;s a great quote that is part of a short article entitled, &ldquo;The Power of Accountability.&rdquo; It is more directed at the boss, but I think those of us who are employees can learn from it as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open, honest conversations have to happen between managers when departments are interdependent and need accountability [ownership for results or non-results] from each other. Discussing difficult issues that may involve a group or team member who is a barrier is extremely important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can replace &ldquo;group or team member who&rdquo; with anything I think and still you find that communication within a company is key.</p>
<p>I agree that you do need to find the right words to use. The wrong words can put your boss(es) on the defensive immediately and that won&rsquo;t take you very far. I enjoy the threads like these as I think there is a lot to learn from the experiences of others.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Part of being an art director is being pragmatic at times, and creative at others. there are times when you&rsquo;ll be right and wrong and times when they will be right and wrong. the biggest mistake I see art directors make is to try and change everything too soon. Change the way a firm or design house has been doing things for years is playing with fire. Of course they hired you to bring your expertise, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean throwing everyone in a loop. if your the creative director&hellip;that is to be expected, you should almost be nuts. As an art director you should be half-way, on both sides.</p>
<p>the creative part of this business is one of the key parts but it&rsquo;s not the only one. Accountants, AE&rsquo;s, junior designers, project managers and so forth, are all accustomed to the way it&rsquo;s been done. It doens&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s right, and your ultimate goal is to change it , but don&rsquo;t shake the cage to hard. time and patience. do you know how many times I&rsquo;ve seen an art director insist on using certain fonts and the production studio doesn;t even have the postcript version, they in turn try and get the company to buy the font, which is useless unless the client demands that font . It&rsquo;s a viscious circle and you probably don&rsquo;t know how hard it is to appease a design sometimes. you just pick and choose a font, click and choose an image. The other&rsquo;s are left to color correct, prep the files for printer. sometimes the files that are at your disposal, aren&rsquo;t sufficient enought for certain print jobs, the agency won&rsquo;t budge and the production studio has to somehow juggle!</p>
<p>Art directors that have had past experience in production work are rare but a gold item. they are the sweetest thing. I swear to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they know that putting white text in front of an image in quark or indesign, means the RIP will raster it at halftones and not spots, so the text will be only 150 lines per inch ( 300dpi) at max when it should be 1200dpi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they know that making images radiant with RGB colors or CMYK ICC profiles that don&rsquo;t match the printer is fruitless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they know that creating thin hairlines (.5 or smaller) in 4 colour process is playing with fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they know that the font family you chose, only has three fonts in the family , with no small caps, decent bolds, etc. too bad you like it, it&rsquo;s their problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they know that the insane layout you did in photoshop with gradients will take 12 hours to prep instead of five. the job is due for client approval in six. too bad it&rsquo;s their problem&hellip; you like it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>this is just the tip of the iceberg. I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re not right about improving the designs, I&rsquo;m saying that the technology, manpower and expertise in this business is real and you can&rsquo;t overthrow it in a few weeks. Patience and cunning my dear.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I read most, but not all the comments in this thread and my first thought upon reading the initial post is to do a layout a standards guide then sit down with them. Walk through it with them and explain why each piece is the way it is and why it can&rsquo;t be something else and where the flexibility lies with each piece.</p>
<p>There is need for consistency in publication design, even if it means consistently different but it should still carry something over such as style. Lots of magazines switch up fonts and layouts but if you ripped a page from the magazine you&rsquo;d still know which magazine it came from. For instance GQ generally uses different fonts but you still know it&rsquo;s a GQ piece from the feel of their use and photography. Rolling Stone is a classic example, although I&rsquo;ve always found it a bit off for my taste.</p>

Explain the logic and reasoning for your design decisions. Seek to educate. Don&rsquo;t be defensive. Give a little now and then. Don&rsquo;t lose your temper (I just did this a few days ago) bad idea. Throw some technological terms in there now and then to show that you&rsquo;re an expert (and watch their eyes glaze over).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The general pattern I am seeing is to try a variety of approaches, and to keep changing tactics. See what works.</p>
<p>Tibor Kalman used to talk and talk about his designs at presentations, and go into great detail and descriptions before actually showing the work. After a while, the clients would be begging to see the work, and would be satisfied with almost anything.</p>
<p>What usually works for me the brute-force method of handouts. Spend time writing a detailed presentation on the work, and the people you are up against will probably not read or understand it entirely, but instead take your word for it. Any dissent can be read as a misinterpretation of an irrefutable argument. Business people are deeply afraid of looking stupid in front of their peers, and will sooner lie than risk appearing vulnerable. Knowing really is half the battle.</p>
<p>So prepare a good argument beforehand, and be sure to bring up comparative studies in the legibility of bold, full caps and sans-serif type, and how each of these factors is affected by leading, line-length and word-spacing. That shuts them up quickly. Another good one is anything relating to The History of Type, 1810–1885. There is enough ammunition in there to wreck any counter-argument of personal taste if you have some good notes, and lull the antagonist into a hypnotic state.</p>

You&rsquo;ll never actually MAKE a person understand your expertise. Rather, you can only do your job to the best of your abilility.</p>
<p>Try making friends with these people instead of battling with them. Over time, when they get to know you really well, they will trust your talents even more and be less likely to resist your suggestions.</p>
<p>One thing most people hate is a know-it-all. You accuse these people of being know-it-alls, but I imagine they feel the same way about you. Just because I&rsquo;m not a doctor doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t have opinions about the medical practice.

Just because I’m not a doctor doesn’t mean I can’t have opinions about the medical practice.

<p>The most compelling point I&rsquo;ve read is the quoted.</p>
<p>You may tend to find that a lot of people have graduated with New Media and Fine Arts degrees, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->honors students<!-- raw HTML omitted --> even, who still can be horribly wrong in their design choices. Granted, they generally should have a better basis for their arguments than someone without the degree or diploma, but that still doesn&rsquo;t make their ideas irrefutable. No matter what position you have at a company, you are there in a vast majority of cases to take on a share of the workload that pertains specifically to that which you had experience and/or education in the field of beforehand. On some occasions you can enter the field cluelessly and have the employer train you to a competent level, hopefully. However, it is very rare when someone is hired to be the end-all-be-all of their position. Director or not, they still need to consider the other collaborators on projects. If a client makes a stupid demand in regards to the creative direction of the project, the only things you can do is either try to explain why you feel it is a stupid suggestion, try to understand why the client feels it&rsquo;s so important, keep quiet and accept it or tell the client that it&rsquo;s too bad and they can look elsewhere for a service provider because you refuse to sacrifice your integrity as an artist. In the last case, you  most likely should make sure that you aren&rsquo;t throwing yourself out the door with the client when you make such a decision.</p>
<p>Nobody is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always<!-- raw HTML omitted --> right. Perhaps you need to make sure that you don&rsquo;t end up with a chip on your shoulder that prevents you from noticing when they might make a good decision that you may have missed.</p>
<p>The point made about research and statistics is correct as well. However I see it from a different perspective. If you want something, you can take the initiative to research and develop a concrete(as far as so is possible) argument on your own behalf. Should the other want to defend their point further, they can refute with their own research. While I&rsquo;m a developer and protected by protocol from the volley of attacks between designers/AM/programmers, I can honestly say that research and statistics on a subjective argument supported only by case studies would definately incline me to produce a counterargument had it been me in that position.</p>
<p>As a designer, you are technically superceded by UI/IA/HI anyways. What you feel may look appealing, may not at all be appealing to actually work with. When it comes to legibility you are often going to be defeated on anything corporate or conservative.</p>
<p>In my experience, when something becomes a harassment to develop because of compatibility between browsers, I find the designers tend to be quite forgiving on the whole. They will give in some areas and not in others. It makes them a pleasure to work with. When all is said and done, that is the most important thing at the end of the day.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion at least.</p>

<p>Look at the colors you chose 
The best you could do I suppose 
A peppermint stripe with royal blue 
The same as the British colors too 
Now how will we tell whose side is who? 
Look at the colors you chose 
Why couldn&rsquo;t it have been puce 
Lavender over chartreuse 
Or possibly some exotic shade 
A delicate orange, mauve, or jade 
Instead of the choice that has been made 
Why couldn&rsquo;t it have been possibly cinnamon 
Everybody wants to be an art director 
Everybody wants to call the shots 
Everybody wants to be a flag dissector 
Changing all my stars to polka dots 
Everybody thinks that they&rsquo;re the final word 
On what is strictly out and what is in 
Howdja like a flag that features fleur-de-lis 
On ochre corrugated tin!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can definately see the past two points as being an all to uncomfortable reality for those who work in advertising firms, or any of the other fields with designers in larger firms.</p>
<p>However, I think it&rsquo;s not so much true in those who work in web. The majority of the web-based firms ( in Toronto at least ) are not large enough for that to take place. While some might argue that in smaller firms, closeness of friends who began a project company together creates the possibility for an incoherant manager much easier than a larger firm where things are more regulated. I personally think the opposite is true. It may be possible for that to happen in the early life of such a firm, but for that firm to have any continued success it would have to rely on pure luck to get by with mismanagement dealing such massive blows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that halfassed mismanaged companys haven&rsquo;t ballooned into bigger companies in the past, but I think you can&rsquo;t use a 1:20,000+ rationale as a legitimate argument for it.</p>
