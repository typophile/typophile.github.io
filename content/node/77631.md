body: "Greater Albion Typefounders has just released the Spillsbury family on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/spillsbury/
  | Myfonts.com]].\r\n\r\nSpillsbury was inspired by some examples of 1920s signwriting
  (principally seen on the side of some vintage vans-good thing they were in a photograph
  and not on the move!).  \r\n\r\nSpillsbury draws inspiration from these sources
  to provide a unique combination of legibility and flair, which echoes the charm
  of advertising and publicity material from the halcyon days of the 1920s. \r\n\r\nA
  basic range of four display faces os offered - Regular, Plain (not all that plain
  really!), Shaded and Shadowed.  \r\n\r\nIn a new departure for Greater Albion, three
  pairs of 'Duo' faces are also offered.  These are designed to be used in pairs-and
  only sold on that basis for little more than the cost of a single face-to provide
  for two-coloured typographic design, enabling the recreation of those evokative
  two coloured blocked lettering styles that were used to such good effect in the
  past.   \r\n\r\nTake a trip back to more colourful times today with Spillsbury!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spillsbury_Gallery8_4100.png]"
