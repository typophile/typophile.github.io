  I am getting discouraged because I can't seem to print the font, or make a PDF for
  that matter.\r\n\r\nI buy fonts frequently, and have never had a problem before.
  Is there something I am not doing? Has anyone else had this happen to them?"

    body: "It's the PS1 version. And I have only bought the roman at this time (125
      Euro) as I was intending to try it, and then buy the other weights I need after
      testing. However, even 125 euro for a single weight is a large investment considering
      the excellent full families  I can get at that price.\r\n\r\nI already had to
      email them after my purchase when I didn't receive a link for a download page
      6 hours after buying the font. Now I can't use the font, so I am a feeling a
      little aggravated with my purchase. However, to DTL's credit, it looks beautiful
      on screen and sets easily."

    <li> The font prints from Illustartor CS and QuarkXPress\r\n <li> The font does
    not print from Suitcase, Font Book, Word or OmniGraffle\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI have
    no idea what that means, however..."
