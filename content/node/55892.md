  reminds me of something between meta and klavika... i am still trying out some different
  styles, like \"k\", \"K\" or \"x\" on one side and rather round forms such as \"s\",
  \"S\".\r\nTell me what you think..."

  body: "Hi Andrej\r\nThis is neat, I like it. Looks like it would be nice for headlines.
    Your s is really nice. \r\nHere are my observations, as a not-very-accomplished
    type designer:\r\n\r\nAmpersand looks like there's a section missing.\r\nB and
    G look narrow. W also looks a bit tight.\r\nS could do with a couple of units
    more weight on the spine.\r\nI find a's tail a bit on the long side.\r\nm is very
    skinny.\r\nr looks like a cut-off n.\r\nI would have a straight y. x looks dark.\r\nI
    find the curved terminals on gjt a bit tight.\r\nI like your cedilla. The other
    diacritics look a bit close to the base glyphs.\r\n\r\nHope that's a bit useful!
    :)\r\n \r\n"

    that Kabron is a \"hip\" way of writing \"cabr\xF3n\" which is \"asshole\" in
    Spanish.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos

  body: "IMHO, \u2018a\u2019 has potential, but it needs a little more of work. No
    doubt about \u2018r\u2019: it looks really weird. Ring: too little white space.
    Agree with Bendy about ampersand.\r\n\r\nThe linguistic note: \u201CCabr\xF3n\u201D,
    at least in Mexico, has a lot of meanings, but certainly it is a bad word in some
    circles\u2026 If you call \u201Ccabr\xF3n\u201D a very good friend, it\u2019s
    ok (\u201Cmate\u201D meaning). If you call \u201Ccabr\xF3n\u201D your boss, you\u2019re
    dead (\u201Casshole\u201D meaning)."

  body: "In Spain and Portugal respectively, \"Kabron\" and \"Cabr\xE3o\" is a very
    insulting word. It means a guy that is doing sex with the wife of a married man.
    May be it means something like \"Motherfucker\" in English\r\n\r\nTalking about
    the topic, it seems to me that the lower case letters and upper case letters are
    two completely different typefaces.\r\n\r\nThe 'a' seems very weird. It creates
    a lot of space between it and the next letter, due to its tail, and you may consider
    doing an exception for its kerning.\r\n\r\nNow i am looking more attentively and
    seems to me the first example of text has an exaggerated kerning, unlike the rest
    of the document."

    so kerning might still be very basic. i dont agree the things you said about the
    \"a\" \u2013 cant see so much space there, but i am concerning doing something
    like this: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_5100.gif]"

    the most glaring letters to me.  Their curves are more open and a bit more linear.
    \ The S's curve is about what you should go for I think.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro

  body: I like it. For now I would make only some comment the design.  At my point
    of view the descender are a bit too long. The bowl of the R are too big comparing
    with the P which one should be the biggest one between the B and the R. Take care
    of the design, look at the top of the C and the S those terminal should be in
    the same way at least the same size. The top of the C is close and the G is open,
    you should choose one of the two and use it for all. In the s the horizontal seems
    too big or her spin is too small. Keep going.

  body: "sim,\r\n\r\nyou are right, i have reduced the descender line abit and balanced
    the C & G. \r\n\r\ni am still not really pleased with S, s, strangely the horizontal
    stems still look way too thick, but maybe its the screen-display... \r\n\r\n"
