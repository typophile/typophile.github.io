body: I am currently looking for a typeface that would substitute for Helvetica Neue
  Light &#40;45 ?&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I am a cheapster, however, I do buy fonts from time
  to time. Since this typeface will have a very short run in a web piece, are there
  any typefaces you can suggest that I could find free that would have the same look
  as Helvetica Neue Light. <BR> <BR>Thank you.

  body: Actually, it would help if I read your post. Arial doesn&#39;t have the style-y
    thin weights. I got a copy of Peter Bruhn&#39;s Eric Sans when I registered with
    Veer. It&#39;s light &amp; has a hell of a lot more style than Helvetica.

    you should spend a little cash and get something well done. You&#39;ll use it
    again, I&#39;m sure.

  body: Chesh, I agree Mordecai would be better off buying fonts, but we don&#39;t
    know what his financial situation is. I&#39;m sure he will find something that
    is functual on a freeware site. The thing he didn&#39;t ask for and I will applaud
    &#40;clap, clap, clap, bet you didn&#39;t think I could do it with one hand&#41;
    him, is he didn&#39;t ask anyone here to send him commercial fonts directly.
