  <BR> <BR>I need help identifying a font. It&#39;s the font of the Turkish airline
  Pegasus. You can take a look at it here: <BR><a href="http://www.airliners.net/open.file/562463/L/"

  like to paint this livery for Microsoft&#39;s Flight Simulator. But I at least need
  to know the font, cause I don&#39;t have any eps files for source. <BR> <BR>If you
  could tell me which font this is &#40;perhaps the registration too?&#41;, I&#39;d
  be gratefull. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>Selcuk'

  body: Looks custom to me, by someone who doesn&#39;t know much about type or logo
    design. The U and the G are very strange. But someone else might be able to point
    you to the font that inspired it - I&#39;m drawing a blank.

  body: Wow! Custom made &#40;custom-ruined hehe&#41; for me! Thanks a LOT Randy!
    <BR> <BR>Since I&#39;m in no way familiar with typography, I never noticed how
    bad it really is, until now. The U and G do indeed look strange. By the way, what
    is the original font&#39;s name?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m aware of that website and I
    already have that logo &#40;it&#39;s not that good&#41;. But thanks anyway. <BR>
    <BR>Could you perhaps tell me the font used for the registration number, or tail-number,
    the font of TC-AP_? <BR> <BR>Well, thanks again. <BR> <BR>Selcuk

  body: 'The font I used is called Optima by Herman Zapf. <BR>The registration font
    is likely not something you can get digitally. They look very constructed to me.
    You could buy fonts that would get you close &#40;<a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=1084803745615003&amp;fontname=Interstate">Interstate
    caps</a> or <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/">FF DIN</a> caps&#41; but it&#39;s
    probably just as good to use plain old Arial. <BR> <BR>You must have the flight
    sim bug pretty bad! <BR> <BR>Edit: <BR>Patricia, agreed. I seriously doubt the
    author of that logo was working from an actual font due to the general lack of
    basic modulation cohesion.'

    <BR> <BR>Patty, the reg you used, TC-APR, is not of the aircraft I&#39;m painting.
    &#40;some off-topic geeky tecnicality here&#41; TC-ARP is a 737-400, I&#39;m painting
    a 737-800. TC-ARP definately looks sqared-off, but the one I&#39;m painting, TC-APM
    looks a bit rounder. I can&#39;t find a photo big and clear enough to show me
    the details. However, the M is spot on if I use Eurostile. So perhaps I&#39;ll
    change it to Eurostile. <BR> <BR>That &#34;Test Drive&#34; feature is great. I
    found that linotype.com offers more flexibility in that area, you can type the
    font size yourself.'

  body: Selcuk, how do you go about painting the plane? Do you have templates for
    the different types of planes? I&#39;m asking because I need to devise paintjobs
    for commercial airplanes as part of a school assignment.. Having templates I could
    put into Illustrator would make the job a lot easier.

  body: For the registration lettering, might want to check out <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/radardesign/b-52/regular/testdrive.html?s=TC-ARP&amp;p=72">B-52</a>
    from Radar Design or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/saa/series-d-d/testdrive.html?s=TC-APM&amp;p=72">SAA</a>
    from URW &#40;I would recommend SAA over Interstate for this purpose -- half the
    price per weight and actually closer to the authentic lettering of the FHWA&#41;.

  body: 'Franz, there are paintkits for painting aircraft. The quality differs, however.
    For example, this aircraft has a very crappy paintkit, just bmp files. No psd,
    no layers, nothing. Some paintkits, on the other hand, are very nicely done, layered
    for each different sort of detail. <BR> <BR>Some things to consider: <BR> <BR>-
    Allmost explicitly, the textures for the fuselage are broken down to several pieces.
    For example - <a href="http://members.lycos.co.uk/drumex/flightsim/kittyhawk_paintkit.jpg"
    target="_blank">http://members.lycos.co.uk/drumex/flightsim/kittyhawk_paintkit.jpg</a>
    <BR> <BR>- Even if you cut&amp;paste all the sections together, you won&#39;t
    have the actual side-view of the aircaft, it will be just the fuselage. If you
    want the complete outline, you may give a try here: <a href="http://www.aerosite.net/artistic.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.aerosite.net/artistic.htm</a> But the images are very
    small, so it won&#39;t help much, I suppose. Oh, I have a very big side-view of
    an Airbus A310-304 &#40;it&#39;s from another paintkit and no livery applied&#41;,
    if you&#39;d like, I can send it to you. <BR> <BR>If you need any further help,
    you can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:drumexx@yahoo.com">drumexx@yahoo.com</a>'
