		<div class="commentbody">m-ga,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Bitstream situation goes roughly as follows: in the 1980s, Linotype was still a large print machines manufacturer who was not interested in making digital fonts for the slowly emerging DTP market. A group of type designers including Matthew Carter left Linotype and started Bitstream, which was to become the first digital type foundry in the world. They digitized original Linotype typefaces, but Linotype refused to license the original trademarks to them. So they used names derived from their own classification (Humanist 777 being Frutiger, Swiss 721 being Helvetica, etc.). Bitstream licensed the names from some other foundries, so some of the fonts used original names (e.g. Futura), but those copied from Linotype, Monotype and Berthold designs usually did not. However, these still were very faithful and high-quality digitizations, not cheap knock-offs like many many other companies offered them.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some time later, the original team left Bitstream. At this time, the company signed the unfortunate deal with Corel so that nearly the entire Bitstream type library (850 fonts or so) shipped with Corel DRAW starting from version 4.0.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Over the time, Bitstream's policy towards other vendors and designers matured, and when Jim Lyles took over the maintainence of the Bitstream type library, they started releasing new designs as Bitstream New Font Collection. They also added the euro character to their old fonts, of course.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the Bitstream Type Odyssey includes a large portion (~850 fonts I think) of the original library and some 600 fonts that are new designs, released by Bitstream or licensed from other foundries.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can browse the contnets of Type Odyssey 2 here: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/product/type-odyssey-2-mac/?mode=alpha">http://www.myfonts.com/browse/product/type-odyssey-2-mac/?mode=alpha</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last year, Linotype and Bitstream signed an agreement which finally ended their dispute over the designs. Linotype officially &quot;licensed&quot; the designs to Bitstream (but not the trademarks). This means, that prior to that, Swiss 721 was an unlicensed clone of Helvetica, and now it's a licensed version of Helvetica, but sold under a different name. The press release is here: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.bitstream.com/categories/news/press/2003_bitstream/071803_linotype.html">http://www.bitstream.com/categories/news/press/2003_bitstream/071803_linotype.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is handy to know as this sort of confirms that the Bitstream versions really are derived from the same original sources.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Best,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

However, IMO this is impractical and may cause confusion.

These often were work in progress, evolving in the designer's mind and constantly adapted to match various technological requirements. Some typefaces have undergone such major revisions that the current versions barely look similar to the initial ones. Best example: Palatino. Current Palatino Linotype is a heavily simiplified text version, Berthold's version captures the display style of the initial drawings. Bitstream's Zapf Humanist 801 is somewhere in-between I think.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So in some cases, different artwork from different periods was used by different companies to prepare the digitizations. Also, most digitizations involve adaptation, so the person who art-directed the digital version also has an influence on the final look.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

In effect there is a moratorium on typographers using new typefaces. The general preference is for retro scripts and mid 20th century faces (mainly sans). The other stultifying factor is the preponderance of bland, utilitarian fonts given away by Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe with their software apps. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So yes, I would say that public sector organizations owe no fealty to mainstream corporate culture, and the affinity of bureaucracies is a powerful attraction between the two, but it should be resisted by free-thinking individuals.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why is a public sector organisation prefering to buy from a small, independent foundry considered to be a &quot;charitable donation&quot;?
