  a lot of interesting and useful information. But now I need some help and thought
  this would be a good place to start.\r\nI am making a piece for a Uni project on
  the history of punctuation. \r\nI want it to be all about the style of writing using
  appropriate fonts for each period of time. But I am stuck with the layout.\r\nI
  only have 6 small paragraphs of text, and they are small. But have pictured this
  as a long narrow print with lots of white space. I am really struggling to find
  anything to help me with the layout of this.\r\nAny advice/suggestions I can go
  to the library with would be much appreciated.\r\nI have included an image of my
  first attempt.\r\n "

  body: "I would recommend literature on how to describe or analyze a problem or a
    task. The better you can describe it the better you can ask questions that will
    get you helpful answers. \r\nMaybe also books on what typefaces are typical of
    which period of time. \r\nFor a first start with Lithos see: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/lithos/?more"

  body: "You could be right with the first point, thanks. I somehow managed to post
    this 3 times as well (my internet kept dropping out) I realised the image didn't
    load up well either so have linked the image here (if it helps) [[http://www.shellintons.com/punct/history1.html]]\r\nThanks
    for the link, I have been off to talk to a typesetter with a good sense of history
    today and that helped me a lot in regards type of font too.\r\n"
