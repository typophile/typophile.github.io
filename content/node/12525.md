  a condom producer in school. they asked me for some creative and technical help,
  so here i am to help them.\r\n\r\ntheir approach is that most condom brands dont
  really have a brand strategy, a good remembered name, most people cant say you more
  than one or two brands.\r\n\r\nthey want to brand their producer with \"Condoms
  are cool, its fun to use them\".\r\n\r\nfonts to use:\r\nwhat fonts would you suggest
  for the text? i thought of:\r\n\r\na.) something very light weighted, a bit sophisticated
  (for the normal user..) like Gill Sans in a light weight.\r\nor\r\nb.) something
  like VAG Rounded, more weight on the fun-part.\r\n\r\nany other ideas?\r\nTHANKS
  alot."
