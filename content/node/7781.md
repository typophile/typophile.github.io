  body: I don&#39;t think the way these letters bounce is part of the font. I suspect
    this may be a heavy weight of Helvetica Condensed in which each of the letters
    has been set individually.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Also, in the future, please use a more
    unique title for your post, like &#39;Aftermath letters&#39;, so we can tell it
    from other posts.&#41;

    target="_blank">Sooperfresh</a>. The bounce is pre-added for your enjoyment.
