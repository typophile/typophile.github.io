  to grow back into old habits.\r\nI'm currently designing this monogram for a photograph.\r\nThis
  is still a work in progress but I would love your thoughts on this one while I'm
  trying to build some kinda balance and \"excitement\" to it.\r\nEach letter has,
  of course, been entirely, designed from scratch.\r\n\r\nMany thanx in advance.\r\n\r\nVirginie\r\n\r\nwww.fluonoir.com\r\nformerly

  body: "The first thing that struck me is the unevenness of the S. The bottom is
    pretty round, the top is a bit flattened, and the inner curves are a bit squarish.
    And the stroke (especially in the bottom half) needs to be smoothed out. It's
    narrow in the cross bar, then gets really fat, then thins out a bit, then gets
    a little fatter, then gets thin (thinner than the end at the top, which seems
    odd).\r\n\r\nThe K, even though I see that the lines are vertical, feels like
    it's leaning to the right. I think because the counter is narrower on the bottom
    than on the top."

  body: "Yes you're right.\r\nThank you for your input.\r\nAs I said, I'm at the very
    begining of this design, although I'm really happy with the overall aspect of
    the K, the S is still a nightmare\u2026\r\nDunno if the G works either.\r\nTrying
    to define a driection right now.\r\nI'm not sure of I should design S on the same
    \"architecture\" than the other letters ?\r\n"

  body: I like the impression the "s" shape gives but it needs more refinement - I
    think the terminal "bulges" don't blend in well enough. It looks too arbitrary
    and not natural enough.

    in the K and G are all such different widths."

  body: I don't think the last two are going to work as a "monogram" A wordmark maybe?
    But I think that you could make it a ton cleaner with more time and guides through
    illustrator. Try investing some more time and see where you get. I am not set
    on that typeface at all either. Sorry. I agree with eliason that the K and G bother
    me.

  body: "all three letters look really bad... k and g don't go with the s at all...
    you are also putting all the emphasis on the s... which is like a middle name
    or something right? The k and j look like mid 90s experimental faces in the worst
    way. I'd start fresh. \r\n\r\nwww.cotdamn.com"
