  body: Well I'll be darned. Although I don't know much of blackletter I decided to
    give it a shot and somehow managed to find the font you're looking for. It's [[Gert
    Wiescher]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=CCW.119179.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Shakira+Oral+Fixation&sampleSize=32">Royal
    Bavarian</a>!
