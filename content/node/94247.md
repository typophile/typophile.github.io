  on exhibit in New York City this summer, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design museum
  had panel of 6 designers whose work appears in the exhibition. Each was asked to
  give a very brief\u2014seven minute!\u2014talk on a \"Wicked Problem\" in type design,
  with a panel discussion afterwards. Cooper Hewitt did a nice video of the event,
  [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2hhkfUzZtw|which you can see here.]]\r\n\r\nThe
  six designers are Philippe Apeloig, Hubert Jocham, Henrik Kubel, Jeremy Mickel,
  Jesse Ragan and yours truly.  Ellen Lupton and Cara Di Edwardo were the moderators.\r\n\r\nI
  talked about how type design can increase readability. Jesse Ragan, who talked about
  his interesting work on Stone Carvings for the New York Public Library, alerted
  me to the fact that 'wicked problem' is a technical term for a kind of problem that
  is important but not well defined. (See the wikipedia article) Readability fits
  that!\r\n\r\nAs the Carnegie mansion, which normally houses the Cooper-Hewitt, is
  being renovated, the exhibit is on Governor's island, a short and free ferry ride
  from the Southern tip of Manhattan. \r\n"

    the right choice for emcee. She seemed to start from the presumption that \"font
    guys are really weird, right?\" and emphasized the esoteric nature of the issues
    at hand repeatedly and mockingly, which seemed to me more likely to stifle than
    encourage the dialogue about type-design problems which was the presumed aim of
    the evening. "

    doesn\u2019t strike me as being particularly academic, curatorial, or seriously
    populist, which is what I would have expected from someone with Ms Lupton\u2019s
    CV.\r\nWasn\u2019t she the orchestrator of the event?\r\n"

    more interesting to people who have an interest in type but may not know a lot
    about it yet.

  body: "For me the whole thing was fun. Of course, I like to show off, that was a
    big plus for me. \r\n\r\nThe stuff I remember as interesting to me includes: Hubert
    Jocham's critique of Rotis, and Jesse Ragan's story of working on inscriptions
    for the NY public library. Mickel's story of the massive project on monograms
    for credit cards, and having it cancelled last minute was a good story, and the
    idea of extending Avant Garde style of ligatures. Apeloig's combination of modernist
    style type but very expressive, romantic use of them in posters was also interesting.
    \r\n\r\nEllen Lupton was charming. I was a bit taken aback by the 'shot' about
    our weirdness, which I took to be playing to the crowd. The crowd, which was over
    the 200 person capacity to the surprise and delight of everyone, was of course
    mainly not type designers. However, all the students of the CooperType summer
    program on type design were there. Cara di Edwardo, was also delightful, and I
    know is extremely knowledgeable about letter forms. \r\n\r\nThere to teach at
    CooperType from abroad were Jean-Francois Porchez, Just van Rossum and Hannes
    Famira. It was nice to meet Jean-Francois and Just for the first time.    \r\n\r\nThe
    exhibition on Governor's Island was also fun. I went to that with my family on
    Sunday. It's a nice picnic-like setting, and we had a perfect mild summer day.
    The exhibition is a survey of all kinds of graphic design. I don't have a clue
    as to why they chose what they chose, though of course I was happy to have one
    thing in it. I remember particularly a piece of Marion Bantjes that has letters
    made with tiny holes punched in one piece of paper, with another a little distance
    behind it. The holes were put in different directions, so that the shadows changed
    what holes are light and dark as you move. It animated what she did very effectively.
    Also there was a wonderful piece of movie title design with something involving
    women in 50s looking outfits. I don't know what movie it was from. There is a
    tremendous amount of stuff there, and I might go again if I get the chance. "
