  body: I am in the same boat and after about the 10th customer complaint I have decided
    my business cannot continue without some OS X tools to test with so I have to
    upgrade. <BR> <BR>I get most complaints from OS X users and Win XP users making
    an OT solution something I&#39;m going to very seriously have to consider in the
    coming years. Not for the coolness of ligature substitution, but because of the
    need to develop a font file that won&#39;t error out on a newer machine. <BR>
    <BR>I would agree with your assumption that most applications and file types will
    remain supported under OS X and I believe you&#39;ll still be able to launch classic
    apps but you won&#39;t be able to boot in classic mode. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, you
    can get Adobe&#39;s studio pack for $999 with Photoshop, Illustrator, In Design,
    and Acrobat which seems like a sweet deal to me. <BR> <BR>As far as the set-up
    goes, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m better off getting a new box and monitor or
    a 17&#34; iMac with the adjustable LCD monitor. I need to get away from the mind
    melting, eye burning CRT monitor. <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;ll make a trip to the
    Apple Store and see what I like best. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll be jumping
    back and fourth between both computers till I figure out how to work efficiently
    in OS X. <BR> <BR>Good Luck! <BR>Stuart :D

    10.2 and found it too slow. So i upgraded to an Other World Computing G4 processor
    for around $240 &#40;ithink&#41; and find it much faster. It was unusable without
    the additional processing power. If you have a rev 1 B&amp;W &#40;which you might
    at 300Mhz&#41;, you should read <a href="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com" target="_blank">http://www.xlr8yourmac.com</a>
    to familiarize yourself with the issues. Your machine may not be capable of using
    OSX well. <BR> <BR>That said, there are so many things to upgrade. I think it
    will end up costing me around $1500 to really be set again. Buit I was lagging
    on upgrades and needed to buy stuff anyway.  <BR> <BR>I moved because I found
    9.1 and 9.2 very frustrating, all the crashing and what not. 10.2 is very stable,
    and Freehand 8 &#40;my key app&#41; runs very VERY quickly in classic mode. Classic
    is FINE for most things. I only need to reboot in OS9 to get anything scanned.
    That could be fixed with a new $99 OSX compatible scanner. So much else is a LOT
    easier in OSX I wouldn&#39;t even consider going back. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s how
    I did it: <BR> <BR>Installed 10.2 and ran it for fun when I was bored. I did this
    for 2 months. Gradually, some of the newer apps hooked me and over the holidays,
    I decided to make OSX my default system. The ones worth switching for include:
    <BR>Safari, iTunes3, iCal, and even the look of it. <BR> <BR>I found OSX mushy
    at first, but it is SO much easier on my eyes. I think the type is much too mushy
    still, but I&#39;ve adjusted. It look s best on an LCD. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR><a href="http://www.joevanderbos.com"

  body: One day at work in the not too distant past ... I was bored, it was slow ...
    I decided to upgrade to OS X Jaguar. I have a Grey G4 &#40;400MHz, 1.5Gb Memory&#41;.
    <i>&#40;How do you know which generation you have?&#41;</i> I realized I hadn&#39;t
    really been using Quark that much anymore. I had really grown accustomed to the
    way Illustrator handles things and noticed that it was serving almost all of my
    needs. For all intensive purposed I was fine in OS 9 -- so I suppose it came down
    to boredom. Or, maybe jealousy, I wanted bouncing icons too. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR>  <BR>After switching I haven&#39;t looked back.
    It is a slower system. I&#39;ll admit to disliking &#40;fearing&#41; technology
    speak and so I haven&#39;t tried to figure out if there are ways to make my machine
    faster. I am a speed freak, but I&#39;m also a book worm.  <BR>  <BR>I tried Font
    Reserve and Font Agent. Twice. The one thing I wasn&#39;t happy about with OS
    X is the way it handles fonts. That said, I have now settled with Font Reserve
    and have found ways to make Font Reserve feel a bit more homey &#40;ATM&#41;.   <BR>  <BR>I
    can understand the Quark Dilemma. I have opened Quark a couple of times through
    Classic, and it seems to be steady and not tooooo slow. But, I&#39;ve just purchased
    the Design Collection and am happy to pronounce that I am now a card-carrying
    InDesign user! I love it. And another bonus about spending most of my days in
    Adobe apps is that it takes advantage of the font handling mechanism now built
    into OS X. Ergo no real need for Type Reunion anymore either. I was told my new
    friend at Font Reserve that Apple has the necessary bits and bobs, and the software
    simply needs to take advantage of it. &#40;how&#39;s that for tech speak?&#41;  <BR>  <BR>I
    did upgrade to 10.2.4 and haven&#39;t had any of the problems that have plagued
    others. Luckily &#40;knock on wood&#41;.  <BR>  <BR>One thing that I have done
    is download something called &#39;mouse zoom&#39; from techtracker. It can amplify
    your mouse to crazy insane speeds. And I also use CandyBar. I didn&#39;t really
    like those folders that came in the Jaguar can.  <BR>  <BR>One question I would
    like to know is about the speed issue. And I guess I&#39;ll have to check out
    xlr8yourmac too. I have a really old monitor. <i>&#40;The type IS to mushy!&#41;</i>
    I do. But I do have an ATI 8500 Mac graphics card. Shouldn&#39;t this help the
    speed? <BR>  <BR>For all of you Quark lovers &#40;which I once was.&#41; I&#39;d
    suggest downloading the 30-day trial of InDesign. Check out what&#39;s under their
    &#34;typographic&#34; hood. It truly is an app for the typographically retentive
    personality &#40;like me&#41;. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    to read this ... <b><i>Where are the updated drivers for our printers? You should
    be totally and utterly ashamed of yourselves!</i></b>

  body: Thanks, guys, for your insights. It looks like it&#39;s not really worth it
    to switch to OSX for my G3... I&#39;ll have to spend money to add RAM, add a G4
    card etc. I probably should get a new machine, but I can&#39;t afford that right
    now. What I really can&#39;t stand any more though is my CRT monitor... <BR> <BR>I
    learned Quark at school, and I hated it! I really can&#39;t see why people don&#39;t
    want to try InDesign. I really love it. It&#39;s the best by far! I looked at
    the Quark web site yesterday, and it seems like they have an identity crisis right
    now... they are trying to turn it into a web design program! I think Quark has
    had it! It&#39;s dead! Where&#39;s the OpenType support? And multi-line composer?
    Optical alignment? I can&#39;t work without those now! But of course, for an average
    graphic designer who mostly designs ads and stuff, these features don&#39;t really
    mean much...

  body: Keith, I have exactly the same 500mhz iBook configuration, but with 640meg
    of Ram. <BR> <BR>I run only 10.2 now, I dont even have classic installed. Speedwise,
    things are <i>different</i> to MacOS 9 - down to the way that pre-emptive multitasking
    works. In some ways X is faster, in others its slower. <BR> <BR>FontLab is easily
    fast enough, and Photoshop is ok too, but I have found that Freehand 10 is painful
    to work with. The demo of Freehand MX I recently downloaded seems to be better
    though. <BR> <BR>There is a performance hit, due to all the pretty eyecandy Mr
    Jobs insist we experience &#40;which I actually like, but then I like lots of
    things&#41;, but there are also definite benefits.  <BR> <BR>Its far more reliable
    - in the last 20 months it has only crashed on me about 5 times - unimaginable
    for MacOS 9. <BR> <BR>One thing to be aware of is the driver issue. Make sure
    that any peripherals that you own have drivers for MacOS X - it is possible to
    use some devices through the Classic environment, but its often not much fun,
    and you really want to be using Classic as little as possible &#40;ideally not
    at all&#41;. <BR> <BR>Oh yes, and Mr Lange is bang on the button. More memory
    the better. 384meg is going to be ok, but 192 might be a tad painful.

  body: Thanks for all your tips! And I have already successfully moved over to OS
    X &#40;10.2&#41;! I had to first upgrade my RAM &#40;from 192 to 384 MB&#41; and
    hard drive &#40;from 6 to 66 GB&#41;. Pretty much everything is running as they
    should be and I&#39;m quite pleased with the new look and feel. I&#39;m still
    trying to get used to it, but it&#39;s not as difficult as I thought. The filing
    system is quite a mess but I think it&#39;s just a matter of habits. I have yet
    to get used to all the text being anti-aliased though... but I think it&#39;s
    beginning to grow on me. I find it better for my eyes... softer. This hefty OS
    &#40;an install of over 1 GB!&#41; seems to be quite sluggish though, probably
    because of those bells and whistles that Steve Jobs put in to make it seductive...
    I love them though :-P <BR> <BR>One thing I do miss, though, is Outlook Express,
    which isn&#39;t available for OS X. I&#39;m using Apple&#39;s Mail, which isn&#39;t
    too bad. But I couldn&#39;t import my emails from Outlook Express. When I launch
    Classic and Outlook Express, my &#39;identity&#39; is lost, so I can&#39;t import.
    But the funny thing is if I start up in OS 9 it&#39;s all there! Any ideas? <BR>
    <BR>Font Reserve is not too bad, but I still prefer ATM Deluxe. The competitive
    upgrade was nice. Fonts are confusing in X! <BR> <BR>Oh, one problem I haven&#39;t
    managed to solve is the Traditional Chinese input method... the order of the characters
    seem to be inverted, with the least common characters coming up first! It&#39;s
    a pain trying to type in Chinese! Any ideas? Or do anyone here use Chinese at
    all? <BR> <BR>K.

  body: It was my monitor that forced the upgrade - The contrast was too hot and the
    pixels were no longer sharp, so I originally decided to get a new monitor. <BR>
    <BR>After looking at the Apple Cinema Displays, I was very disappointed at how
    blurry everything looked vs the 17&#34; iMac monitor so it seemed like it was
    worth the entire upgrade. <BR> <BR>Regarding color accuracy, I don&#39;t believe
    at this point it&#39;s as bad as it was back in the late 90s so I bet most any
    LCD display will have a profile with it that will sync with a Mac. Go to a CompUSA
    and look at monitors, there are many much cheaper than Apples that I feel are
    sharper. <BR> <BR>Regarding the wider aspect ratio and kerning, since I still
    use FOG, I am limited by how wide I can open the metrics window and kern the letters
    and adjust the data below, so I&#39;ll have perhaps an additional 25% width gain
    which will give me more room to see the kerning of the font as well as to enter
    the metric data. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the OS X tip! <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: '<i>Any suggestions for getting comfortable with the new files and folders
    interface?</i> <BR> <BR>Stuart-- <BR>The main thing to remember about folders
    in OSX is to put all your stuff in your &#34;home&#34; folder. This is the one
    with your user name on it in the Users folder. When you&#39;re running Classic
    or booting into OS9 &#40;for FOG&#41;, resist the temptation to put files in the
    old Documents folder in the main hard drive window, or anywhere else, for that
    matter, outside your home folder. It makes things easier to get to when you&#39;re
    running OSX. <BR> <BR>As for the Finder, I would suggest hiding the toolbar that

    10.1 came out, and full-time since Jaguar was released. I&#39;m very comfortable
    with it now. I still use 9 part of the time on a different Mac, and there are
    some things I like better about 9 compared to X, but it just isn&#39;t in the
    same league anymore. '

  body: <i>The main thing to remember about folders in OSX is to put all your stuff
    in your &#34;home&#34; folder.</i> <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t do that! My OS is on a
    6 GB hard drive, and it only has very little space left. So I created a folder
    called &#39;Documents 2&#39; on my 66 GB HD, and made it a favourite item so I
    can get to it easily. Does this work? Is there a way to work around this? <BR>
    <BR><i>You also may want to avoid the column view &#40;although some people seem
    to like it&#41;.</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m one of those people who really resisted
    the column view at first but have learned to like it. It is actually very convenient
    because you can keep track of the paths. Many people might not know this, but
    in the earlier OSs &#40;OS X too for that matter&#41; if you hold down command
    and click on the window title, a menu pops up, showing you where you are in the
    hierarchical file system. The column view and the back/forward button do exactly
    the same thing, only more accessible. <BR> <BR><i>but it just isn&#39;t in the
    same league anymore.</i> <BR> <BR>Well, OS X is terribly sluggish, at least on
    my G3! I don&#39;t like how I can&#39;t keep track of how much RAM I&#39;m using.
    Yeah, I have 384 MB RAM, but I feel like I have less because of the overall sluggishness
    and the automatic RAM allocations. At least all the bread-and-butter tasks in
    OS 9 were quick! I&#39;m just talking about opening windows and switching apps
    and stuff. Everything feels &#39;sticky&#39;! Too much shadows and transparency,
    I think. Are there any ways to disable them? <BR>

  body: '<i>...put all your stuff in your &#34;home&#34; folder.  <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t
    do that! </i> <BR> <BR>I should have clarified that: The rule applies only to
    your start up drive. Additional drives are used same as before. <BR> <BR>As for
    speed, yes, in some ways OS9 is faster and more responsive. I find that OSX makes
    up for it in other ways though:  <BR>- Better multitasking so you aren&#39;t forced
    to wait for operations to finish before doing something else. You can, for example,
    check your email or start another program while saving or opening a large file.  <BR>-
    System crashes are rare, so no time wasted on restarts. Once in a while an application
    may crash, but you can start it right up again immediately with no ill effects,
    and such crashes have no effect on other applications. I once browsed MacFixit
    while an installer was &#34;hung&#34; and was able to fix it and get it working
    again without restarting, or even quitting the browser. <BR>- Putting the computer
    to sleep and waking it up again is almost instantaneous. <BR> <BR>As for memory,
    you don&#39;t have to think about it at all. Applications will use as much as
    they need, up to almost the total RAM you have installed, regardless of how many
    other applications are running. In fact, you can run as many as you like, regardless
    how much RAM they want. There is a short delay when switching between applications
    in such a situation, but if it becomes a problem, just install more RAM. No need
    to monitor or optimize anything. <BR> <BR>In general, plenty of RAM and a fast
    G4 does help. I&#39;ve used it on a 500mhz G4 Cube with 896mb RAM and a 1ghz G4
    Powerbook with 512mb RAM and it runs well on both, but better on the Powerbook.
    <BR> <BR>There are things I dislike about OSX, but they are potentially fixable.
    The things that are wrong with OS9 will never be fixed. <BR> <BR>I will say, though,
    that OSX is not as good &#40;yet&#41; as OS9 for font development unless you embrace
    FontLab. FOG can be run in Classic mode, but it&#39;s happier running on 9 or
    earlier. Also, I don&#39;t know of any way to work with font suitcases in OSX
    or Classic.'

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve never had to do it, but the &#34;repairing permissions&#34;
    thing Joe describes is similar. It&#39;s more like Disk First Aid for when you

    <BR> <BR>I must say that one of the apprehensions I had about switching to OSX
    was that my nearly 20 years of Mac system troubleshooting voodoo skills would
    become obsolete. So it has. But, so far, and maybe I&#39;m just lucky, I have
    found less need for such skills in OSX. '

    OS X is fundamentally better than OS 9 as an operating system. It&#39;s just not
