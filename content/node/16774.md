body: "Hi all! I'm designing a cookbook for vegan soups and the author/illustrator
  wants to use <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/panorama-sg/Panorama\"
  >Panorama</a> for the titles and would like some suggestions for a body type \"that's
  kind of like Optima but a little more contemporary.\"\r\n\r\nI feel like Optima's
  a bit close to Panorama, and would make more sense to go with serif, but I'm open
  to suggestions...\r\n\r\n(said in your best Linda Richmond voice)...<em>Optima is
  neither a serif or a sans-serif...discuss </em>...\r\n"

  body: In the Optima territory, I like <a href="http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amira">Amira</a>,
    but it might work better with both titles and body.

  body: "I think your instincts are right-on ... Optima (as well as its bastard cousin,
    Zapf Humanist - both technically sans serifs, btw) is way too close to Panorama
    to use them together .. a serif would be a MUCH better choice. I wouldn't get
    too fancy .. since this is a cookbook, and readability is paramount (like when
    is it not .. lol) .. try to picture folks running back and forth .. pantry to
    cookbook .. they need to be able to focus back where they left off quickly and
    comfortably ..\r\n\r\nMaybe Life from Adobe .. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/life/\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I always thought Caslon (maybe 224) worked well with Optima, ergo should match
    with Panorama .. basically a \"chiseled\" sans serif with a \"chiseled\" serif
    ..\r\n\r\n-fQ-"
