body: "Looking for the header, body, the page number at the bottom, and the \"GO ON
  TO THE NEXT PAGE\" font for:\r\n\r\n[[http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/apcentral/ap13_frq_english_language.pdf]]\r\n\r\nThe
  header looks very close to Serifa and Glypha, but it's not exact (to me, anyway)."

  body: The PDF's properties indicate that the page uses mostly Minion and several
    weights of, indeed, Serifa.
