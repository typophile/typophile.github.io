  courses that exist via correspondence? I live in New Zealand and would love to study
  about typesetting but can\u2019t find any courses that cover this subject specifically.
  I\u2019ve been working as a book designer for the past 3 years but would love to
  hone my skills. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks ...\r\n"

  body: "I'm not sure what you are asking. Do you mean something like the mechanics
    of getting an author's files into a typesetting program (i.e. \"How to get Word
    into InDesign\"), or something like the aesthetics of typesetting (e.g., What's
    the difference between a compositor and a typesetter)?\r\n\r\nIf the former, I'm
    sure there are a lot of correspondence courses on the market. The latter is entirely
    different. I don't even know of any good books on the subject, though Dowdings
    <cite>Finer points in the spacing and arrangement of type</cite> at least shows
    things people sometimes consider part of the *practice* of typography, which includes
    setting type. (I'm showing my bias here; Dowding covers \"good\" typography as
    seen through a 1940s British lens.)\r\n\r\nViewed one way, design and composition
    are on a continuum; the compositor just deals with smaller details. But in other
    ways they are quite different. For example, in setting justified copy, the typesetter
    is always seeking to make the best of several compromises; usually the designer
    isn't thinking in terms of compromise at all.\r\n\r\nIf you can be a bit more
    specific, maybe we can offer some advice."

  body: "Definitely the latter. Perhaps put another way I would like to learn the
    'art' of being a good typesetter. There is nothing worse than a beautiful book
    being let down by poor typesetting, second only to spelling mistakes in my opinion!
    \ \r\n\r\nThank you for your book recommendation, unfortunately it seems to be
    out of print.  Any other suggestions would be very welcome.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As for Dowdings book, the Wace edition is long out of print, and sells used
    for around $150 U.S. I'm surprised the Hartley & Marks edition is out of print.
    But since Dowding supervised the Wace edition (& would have held his nose at the
    Hartley & Marks rendering), perhaps it is just as well.\r\n\r\nThere are any number
    of books which cover setting type, usually as a part of design, such as Mitchell
    & Wightman's <cite>Book Typography</cite>, but even these I'd regard as \"manuals.\"
    Put it this way: in the design category, there are books which prescribe what
    (the author thinks) is good design, then there are books that help you think about
    good design. Rich Hendel's <cite>On Book Design</cite> is one of the latter. I
    don't know any books dealing with composition that parallel <cite>On Book Design.</cite>\r\n\r\nGoing
    far out on a limb, I think the biggest element in the composition of book text
    is getting the word spacing right. When setting a new book, I go through tests
    establishing the min-ideal-max word spacing with a particular design AND A PARTICULAR
    TEXT. If I've used the font before, this is usually done quickly. And just like
    a designer, if I haven't used the font before, I'm probably not going to get it
    just right anyway -- but I still try; it takes an hour or more.\r\n\r\nOther spacing
    compromises will be forced on you by the publisher's house style. If, for example,
    they don't allow a hyphen after two letters, (e.g., be-cause is ruled out) the
    evenness of the word spacing will suffer. The same with prohibiting the last word
    of a paragraph from being hyphenated. Or \"no hyphens overleaf.\" All of these
    have been considered \"good\" composition rules, but the person who specifies
    them seems to forget that the comp cannot rewrite the copy; all he or she can
    do is follow them at the expense of even word spacing.\r\n\r\nMy favorite book
    for reflecting on both design & composition is Blumenthal's <cite>The Art of the
    Printed Book, 1455-1955</cite>, because it covers several centuries, several countries,
    and a host of styles as fashion changed. But I have the Godine edition, I'd be
    a bit suspicious of the Oak Knoll edition (http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=3276&d_currency=)
    <cite>An Atlas of Typeforms</cite> is another good source for examining how type
    looked across the centuries. What is considered good or fashionable in 2008 may
    be a bit different, but the issues we all struggle with have not changed.\r\n\r\nPut
    it this way: good composition is, in its way, as much a craft as good design.
    As with design, there are no recipes to guarantee success. "
