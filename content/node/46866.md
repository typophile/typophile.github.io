  software.  While strong support for Unicode and internationalization is starting
  to appear, the more advanced features for Latin alphabets have yet to be tackled.\r\n\r\nI'm
  going to begin work on fixing the more glaring (and trivial) oversights, like the
  unimplemented support for true small caps in Pango (a library which powers a number
  of free programs like Inkscape). After that, however, things get more challenging--so
  I want to make sure I'm fulfilling the most-wanted features.\r\n\r\nA quick search
  indicates that free software applications aren't widely used by members of this
  forum, most likely due to their inferior feature-sets when it comes to typography.
  \ Here's a chance to change that.  If you've tried Inkscape, Scribus, OpenOffice.org,
  or similar programs in the past, and found them wanting, please let me know what
  missing or broken features caused you to switch away.  If you've never given these
  applications a spin, consider doing so, and let me know what you'd like to see in
  them.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n"

    offers the ability to specify the language of a certain text run, also <code>locl</code>.

  body: Bearing in mind that while many font developers understand what these OpenType
    abbreviations mean, that cannot be assumed of the general end-user population;
    therefore a brief description or expansion of the feature abbreviation should
    be displayed in the user interface where applicable.

    disappointed by the lack of OTF support for FreeType, although that gets a fairly
    reasonable explanation in their documentation.\r\n\r\nA robust OTF engine should
    have no problem with RTL languages, although -- as with some more OTF features
    -- that overlaps with User Interface, physically drawing strings, way of data
    storage, etc..\r\n\r\n<cite>[..]what these OpenType abbreviations mean [..]</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't have no problem with selecting the correct abbreviation per feature (not
    being part of the \"general end-user population\"), but I'm pretty sure Adam didn't
    mean quite that.\r\n\r\nBest would be a single general programming library that
    does all of the above!"

  body: "Thanks for your opinions!  Adam, I'm particularly grateful for your careful
    suggestions. \r\n\r\nTheunis, regarding the single library: HarfBuzz implements
    a lot of the OpenType layout features missing from FreeType.  The software is
    an unglamorous bit of code shared between Pango and Qt4, with little documentation
    or development at the moment, but it does its job; and the developers of the two
    libraries (and myself, if I can be proficient enough) want to make it the standard
    way of doing OpenType magic across all FLOSS, even on non-FLOSS operating systems.\r\n\r\nPango
    currently has almost everything sitting on the cusp of implementation.  It seems
    the current developers haven't seen much demand for these features, or at least
    have (quite justifiably) been focusing on getting basic support for all languages
    before concentrating on advanced features for Latin scripts.  Currently, I'm working
    on finding the best way to alter the Pango API to enable access to the OpenType
    features; I've got a couple good ideas, but since Pango is used by thousands of
    applications, there's probably going to be some back-and-forth before an API is
    settled on.  In any case, this API will allow access to and inspection of any
    OpenType feature listed in the OpenType specs, and will also include some short
    aliases in order to let non-typographically-inclined developers use \"small-caps\"
    to get real small caps.\r\n\r\nImplementing this in Pango-based applications should
    be relatively straightforward from that point.  The biggest challenge has nothing
    to do with typography, actually: the file formats will most likely have to be
    changed to accommodate the additional information, and that always involves a
    lot of testing to ensure no corruption (and backwards-compatibility, if possible).
    \ In any case, I'll start with Inkscape (I use it myself frequently) and move
    on from there.\r\n\r\nOf course, many excellent applications aren't Pango-based
    (notably Scribus, OpenOffice.org, and the KOffice suite).  I'll tackle these after
    working on Inkscape, along with Win32 and OSX support if it is necessary."

    features itself! See brief [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pango#Support_for_OpenType_features

    been looking for a font rendering engine with OpenType support myself when I came
    across this thread. I suppose \"rendering\" is the wrong word, since Freetype2
    already does rendering, but what is missing is a way to look up the font features
    that Miguel Sousa posted above.\r\n\r\nHas anybody come across any sort of open
    source library at all that allows something even as basic as loading the ligature
    table from a font?\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to write a typesetting library that
    takes an input character string and performs all the necessary lookups in the
    font to create a glyph string, which then in turn will be kerned and rendered
    by Freetype2. I would appreciate any previous experience or information you might
    have on that matter.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
