    Univers (and the only Grot I like). Yes, it's available, through FontHaus and/or
    maybe FontShop.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    it in an old FontShop catalogue, I can't seem to find it on their site or at FontHaus
    or anywhere else. Could this just be my inability to use the internet? "

        no longer available for legal reasons. How disappointing.
