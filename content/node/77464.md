  do you say? How is it as an <em>identity</em>?"

  body: "I would prefer the words to be legible as in your last option - but the contrast
    need not be that great - perhaps using a bold for yaletown design would be sufficient.
    \ A lot depends on the familiarity of the word yaletown ..oh I just realized the
    other word is 'software'! \r\n   \r\nIf you keep using it people will definitely
    recognize it.  How about slanting the whole thing say at 5 degrees (as much as
    the italic tilt) - that would make it even more unique.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yaletown_4463.jpg]\r\n\r\nCheck
    the UNIQLO logo which is on two lines - I do not know what it means but it is
    instantly recognizable."

    plus the unorthodox break point (not between syllables) makes it difficult to
    decipher.\r\n\r\nThe third version -- which you've achieved via blind-pressing
    but could also be done with ink colors or screen tints -- is the most readable
    since it provides more visual clues."

    in mind that blind embossed elements disappear when a document is xeroxed or faxed.
    Probably not a concern in business cards, but maybe a concern for invoices, letterhead,
    etc.\r\n"

  body: I like the way the words play with you to make you read them, though not sure
    whether generally people have that sort of patience with a logo. I'd also agree
    the typeface doesn't click with software design, so maybe selecting a different
    style would help the eyes parse the words with less effort?

  body: "Thanks for the comments, guys.\r\n\r\n@Vladimir - \"Oh I just realized the
    other word is 'software'!\" - Bingo! This <em>Oh</em> is exactly what I am aiming
    for. This is what effectively defines the logo and makes it memorable. Rotating
    the logo is a nice idea, but IMO it will be overdoing it for a software company.
    Rotated version seems more fit for a clothing line manufacturer or similar.\r\n\r\n@Bendy
    - Totally valid point regarding the patience, Bendy. I do intend to address it
    by using the logo in the context that has the word \"software\" sitting somewhere
    next to the logo.\r\n\r\n@iamcorey - With regards to the typeface - the point
    of using HighTower was to make the logo more visually interesting and stress the
    <em>design</em> part. The <a href=http://typophile.com/node/56751>previous iteration</a>
    used Trade Gothic, but it was somewhat Blah looking to me. If you have any suggestions
    or ideas, I am all ears.\r\n\r\n@Matt/James - I would rather not make it easier
    to decipher. Using different weights, colors or hinting with kerning (as in <a
    href=http://typophile.com/node/56751>previous version</a>) seems to detract from
    the logo. It makes the logo visually more complex, but at the same time it also
    trivializes the concept. The grand idea is to make the logo memorable through
    making it unusual. To make the viewers \"WTF\", pause and think :) And my assumption
    is that present version does just that."

  body: Alex, I respect your point of view, but I noticed that your Yaletown Software
    Design homepage says "the most complex software ... can be made simple and intuitive".
    Seems to me that your logo should represent that "simple and intuitive" philosophy,
    rather than being a logo which most folks seem to have trouble figuring out.

    centered layout is a little dull, and I don't feel the heavy rules above and below
    add anything.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase serif you've used on this page is more elegant
    & visually interesting, so in those respects I think it's an improvement. But
    the readability problem we've discussed bothers me.\r\n\r\nWish I had some brilliant
    idea to offer, but at the moment I'm drawing a blank. My only thought is that
    Yaletown and Software both have 8 characters, so maybe some kind of solution involving
    a grid might be worth exploring, like 3 rows of 8 boxes each, and grids vaguely
    make me think of the structure of programming. I know \"Design\" is only 7 characters,
    but maybe a workaround could be found using a dingbat character or solid box or
    whatever to make it 8, too.  This grid idea is just a top-of-my-head thought and
    it's probably a lousy idea; it's just a thought."
