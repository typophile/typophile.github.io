  is hard work and I'm getting a little overwrought. I thought I'd take\r\na break
  and post what I've got so far on the \"chopping block\" as it were.\r\n\r\nI know
  there are big issues with the face so far, but, let's talk about\r\n'em and how
  I can improve the set. I have only developed what you see\r\nhere so far. I am trying
  for a humanist face <em> LOOSELY </em> rooted in Gill Sans.\r\nThe principle design
  elements are the curved slab serifs and the stroke\r\ntaper at the connections.\r\n\r\nSay
  what you will; let's get these letters into shape!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/baby_face_5377.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRachel"

  body: "Wow, this looks incredibly a lot like a sign I hand lettered for the school
    that I work in and I was thinking about how it'd look nice as a font.  You beat
    me to it haha \r\n\r\nAnyways, the flat descenders and ascenders I really like.
    \ I wonder if you might be able to pull out the j and the f and make them a bit
    longer, same for the p and the q.  The almost mechanical look is what gives it
    its character, play with it some more.  Also you might try making the serif a
    bit smaller on the b or the d (or both).  Because they almost connect with the
    bowl, the serifs look much heavier.  It doesn't seem to be a problem for the r,
    probably because of it's more horizontal approach to the stem.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Cool!\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to see an alternate lowercase two-story g...it's
    the only one that needs a character-width horizontal stroke on the descender/ascender.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

    setting some words with it?"

  body: The h, k, n, t, u need to be a little wider. check the optical weights of
    the horizontal vs. vertical strokes (e.g. the descending stem of the g and the
    left of the bowl are not similar enough. It seems to have great potential. I can
    see a fantastic display version as well as a functional text version.
