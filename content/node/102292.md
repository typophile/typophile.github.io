  logo I designed about 2 years ago but I've lost a hard drive since then which contained
  the original file for the logo and the font itself... oops...\r\n\r\nIt is an actual
  font and not a live traced version of a sans serif, but I can't remember what it's
  called.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HGC-logo-text-only_6553.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help anyone can give me with this. I need to do some more work in the same
  font for this client but can't identify it.\r\n\r\nMark"
