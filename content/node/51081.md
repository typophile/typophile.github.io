  much an exercise in making something very controlled and unexpressive as it is in
  making a useful and attractive sans font in a limited time (a week and a half in
  this case). I think I still managed to shove a few quirks in there anyway. It's
  wound up a strange hybrid of Helvetica and Futura to my eyes, created entirely independently
  of course; all my own points and curves with the help of the Quaker space program.
  Perhaps it's <em>too</em> simply done. It still has some spacing and kerning issues
  but I'll iron those out before too long. Feedback, as always, is welcome and desired.\r\n\r\nPDF

    bouncy personality, like ad copy in the Eisenhower/Kennedy era. I think the tight
    curls of f, t, and y, f and t's long crossbar, and the high crossbar of e give
    it that. The t is interesting - its balance on its little umbrella handle is precarious,
    but \"normalizing\" that might sacrifice some of this character. I would look
    at its overshoot (seems to ride high), and I would reconsider its top shear -
    seems too sharp to me.\r\n\r\nV and v fall apart at the vertex - top of N, too.
    Some uneven weights, esp. in the figures: 7's diagonal and 5's bowl are too dark,
    for example. 9 looks topheavy. z looks too dark and too sharp.\r\n\r\nI think
    i's dot is too low (turns into a short l at small sizes), and the apostrophe may
    be too high. I'm not sure the curly question mark fits in with the font."

  body: "I'm glad you picked up on that. I was trying to get something a little retro
    feel in this without tying it to a too specific era. Maybe I got inspired by everyone
    else who's been inspired by Saul Bass movie titles.\r\n\r\nThe punctuation dots
    (period, &al.) were derived from the square tittle with auto-curvature activated
    to turn it into a slightly larger circle, and the comma and quotation marks derived
    from that with an added tail, Would a straight cut tail rather than the pointed
    one make them fit better, or should I go further and make them square like the
    tittle?\r\n\r\nI do have an alternate straight legged question mark. I'll make
    that the preferred and the serpentine one the alternate. It seemed too skinny
    at first glance, though, and a twisty one was good enough for Futura to annoy
    people with for nearly a century.\r\n\r\nThe stem of the 7 is a bit thick. That's
    always a hard one to balance. I didn't want to curve it, and making it the standard
    stroke weight of the font makes it look too skinny among other numbers on screen,
    but seeing it in print it does stand out a bit.\r\n\r\nAll the lc accents are
    too low, i and j dots included. It's nice that the program can reset them higher
    for me. I don't want to put them all the way at cap-height though, that's just
    too much air.\r\n\r\nOK, off to do an update..."

    a and wondering about thinning the joins, and the horizontal on the t seems heavy
    though i'm sure it's the same weight as the vertical. Is that crossbar a bit too
    wide? I wonder if the comma and quotes could be squarer rather than tapered to
    a point. z is quite wide isn't it?\r\nThe crossbars on the euro look too long.\r\nHope
    that's helpful :) Look forward to seeing more."

    ch (I don't see a ct in the sample, but it needs to be treated the same way).
    The long-s+t is fine, and the \xDF is fine for weight, but I've never really liked
    the style with a large upper bowl. It might help if you make the transition from
    the lower \"s\" shape to the upper curve point more northeast, if that makes sense.
    (If not, I'll draw a picture.)\r\n\r\nOpening up the spacing will really help
    at text sizes. (You might want to have Caligrot Text and Caligrot Titling vel

  body: "The middle one is best but I think it should be slightly nearer to the right
    hand one. Can you interpolate between 2 and 3 about 20%?\r\n\r\nI've just checked
    the latest pdf. It really suits Scandinavian languages somehow! I like the horizontal
    terminals and semicircular endings. Perhaps \xD8 and \xF8 need horizontal stroke
    endings too? And perhaps you could design a Q with somehow a semicircular tail?\r\n\r\nI'd
    take the loop of J up a bit more to echo the f and j loops. x looks wide. The
    arches on n and u look slightly unresolved. The corners on N don't match. z looks
    dark.\r\n\r\nGenerally the straight stems are a hair too light for the bowls,
    which seem darker to me. Look at the word 'noite' and it seems the o and e are
    darker than the others. I'd make the 'hat' of the 1 much more generous.\r\n\r\nMiddle
    two strokes of w could be a few units narrower. k's lower leg is much steeper
    than the capital version and looks like it could start lower.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure
    whether you want detailed crit or general stylistic impressions, and the next
    bit might be more about the very fine-tuning which you are going to come to anyway
    next...\r\n\r\nThe overall colour of the text blocks seems a bit spotty and I'm
    not sure if it's the spacing or the stroke weight. I think perhaps there's a bit
    of both. For example, the inner contour of the roof of the a could be nudged up
    2 or 3 units, the valley between the two curves of the m could be pushed a few
    units to the right, the joins of arches to stems makes some glyphs a bit heavy
    (r and u for example), and inner counters are not quite following the same ductus
    as the outer contours like on a, e and u.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that's the next level
    of detail from where you are now, sorry!\r\n\r\nCan you set a block in CAPS so
    we can see how that looks?\r\n\r\nThese are just opinions and I'm still a learner
    about these things so see what others think too... :)"
