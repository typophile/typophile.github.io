  of the founder of Fountain and my personal type design idol, <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/designers/peterbruhn.asp\">Peter
  Bruhn</a>. Here's to another year of experimentation and inspiration. Looks like
  there's some <a href=\"http://bruhn.blogs.com/rants/2006/05/typeface_after_.html\">good
  stuff \u2019round the&nbsp;bend.</a>\r\n\r\nWish the man luck today as he travels
  to speak at <a href=\"http://www.typoberlin.de/index.php?iframe=index.php%3Fnode_id%3D178%26lang_id%3D3\">TYPOBerlin</a>.
  A guy with a humble heart, Peter is always nervous giving speeches, but the audience
  is none the wiser as his work makes him smile and shine on stage.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lovethebruhn_5532.png]\r\n<a

  body: "Hi guys, thanks :-D\r\n\r\nI had a great evening dinner celebrating my \"Sweet
    Thirtyseven\" with Fountain designers Simon Schmidt, his wife Suse and Daniel
    and Sylvia Janssen. \r\nThe rest of the conference was great as well. My speech
    was a bit flaky and to fast in the beginning since I totally forgot my english
    and mixed it up with german. But I got more calm in the end. A one hour speech
    in 35 minutes ;-D"
