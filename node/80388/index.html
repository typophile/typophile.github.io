  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My mom uses Arial Rounded . . . a lot. She sent an email to a mailing list, as she often does and some crazy woman totally flipped out on her for ALL CAPS YELLING. However the original was not in all caps. I suspect the internetwhiner didn't have Arial Rounded and an all caps font with similar Panose settings was substituted. I don't think there is Panose setting to indicate that a font is all caps. Should every Panose setting in an all caps font have all setting set to "no fit"? What about the Latin Decorative/initials setting?

		<div class="commentbody">All Capitals is not a Panose variable ... It would be something else if your mum used Arial Rounded and commented on its lack of serifs -- and a whiner would say "hey, on <em>my</em> screen this font <em>has</em> serifs!".
A quick check would be to copy the text from the whiner's screen and paste it anywhere else, then change the font.

It might have been the other way around!</div>

She tried to but I think the whiner was too <em>intense</em> to listen to reason. I wonder how many often people have received emails which inadvertently appeared to be yelling because fonts were substituted for all caps fonts.

I imagine the typical Panose settings for a typical all caps font doesn't differ from a regular font. For example, if someone created an all caps rounded sans and faithfully applied <a href="http://www.panose.com">proper</a> Panose settings according, it could end up with exactly the same Panose settings as Arial Rounded.

To prevent future yelling, perhaps font creation software could automatically set all Panose categories to No Fit for all caps font. Provide an ALL CAPS checkbox the same way FontLab studio provides a Monospaced checkbox. When checked, it would automatically set all Panose settings to no-fit.


If you're reading this and you don't know what Panose settings are, check out http://www.panose.com & http://www.typophile.com/node/74374

The first Google result for PANOSE is the Wikipedia entry for PANOSE:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PANOSE

And the first paragraph of that entry says: 

"The word PANOSE is compound from letters taken from the six classes in which the creator of the system organized the Latin alphabet"</div>

My googling must have included "acronym," which removes those sources from the results.
