  body: "<em>You shouldn\u2019t stay in the same position for too long.</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    way the industry is structured and positions set up, it isn't possible to stay
    in any one position for too long. I work on a contractual basis for an agent who
    finds me work. I don't hold an actual position or job as such. I'm given jobs
    to do for numerous clients. My agent sends me in, I go in, do the job, get out
    real quickly. I ams da semantic hitman. Much of it I do from my desk at home.
    The hardest part is getting paid.\r\n\r\n<em>If it\u2019s good, it transcends
    language.</em>\r\n\r\nYes and no. Some ads I've worked on are \"good\" by industry
    standards, but they don't transcend language. Others kick arse in a purely visual
    capacity with no use of verbal or written language at all, but they still involve
    semantics, and in that sense are transcendent.\r\n\r\n<em>Working in the industry
    will affect your family life at some point.</em>\r\n\r\nYes, but so what, working
    in any industry will affect your family life.\r\n\r\n<em>It creates careers for
    art-school dropouts.</em>\r\n\r\nYes, most definitely. I never bothered finishing
    art school because it was packed with wankshafts, most of who I now compete with
    on a professional basis.\r\n\r\n<em>The same concepts are endlessly recycled.</em>\r\n\r\nOh
    spit yeah. But it's a high-pressure industry. It eats people and devours ideas.\r\n\r\n<em>You
    fast-forward through the boring stuff.</em>\r\n\r\nWho, ad people or consumers?\r\n\r\n<em>The
    Internet took it to a whole new level.</em>\r\n\r\nYes it did. Some people ask
    me why I don't have an online portfolio when I'm an ad writer/concept guy and
    the internet surely is cutting edge for self-promotion in that line. The answer
    is &#8212; I don't need one, my agent gets me all the work I can handle. The same
    people ask me why my agent doesn't have a website. The answer is &#8212; they
    don't need one either. They use the traditional tools of the trade; a paper notepad,
    an eraser pencil and a phone. Job sourcing and media buyers use the internet only
    sparingly to promote themselves. The business really doesn't work that way. Everything
    that happens is a foregone conclusion predicated on existing relationships between
    people who are \"in the business\".\r\n\r\n<em>It\u2019s hard to transition out
    of.</em>\r\n\r\nYes, very hard. I'm a failed filmmaker so I took the next best
    thing. Now I want out but it's hard, very hard to get \"out\", so wish me success
    with my type designs because I'm a lot like an actor &#8212; I don't know how
    to do anything else, and I'm gettin' old.\r\n\r\n<em>They both have weird self-congratulatory
    award shows.</em>\r\n\r\nYepp. The internet awards shows are much wierder and
    self-congratulatory than anything I've seen in advertising.\r\n\r\n<em>Only the
    people who create it are delusional enough to call it art.</em>\r\n\r\nI don't
    call it art, and most people I work with don't pretend it's art either. It's soft
    soap (industry term). I've met people who create it and call it art, and those
    are the people I avoid working with.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
