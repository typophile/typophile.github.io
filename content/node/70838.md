  body: This came off a business card made about 20 years ago. Was done for some biker
    folks and I would have to believe they went as cheap as possible. (I know them).
    It could be artwork but they would have had to rob a bank to pay for it....

  body: "It looks like painful things have been done to it, as most of the letters
    seem like their outlines are broken. Was the card mangled, or is this a lousy
    scan?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Looking at Mac McGrew's book of American Metal Typefaces there is a bold
    version of Goudy Oldstyle that was designed by Morris Benton between 1916 - 1919
    to go with the Goudy-designed typeface. The swash M is a slanted version of what's
    on your card. The Roman version of Goudy Bold type has the same g and the i's
    have the same diamond shaped dots. Its 'n' matches the normal n on your card.
    The swash 'n' doesn't look like anything from the typeface samples in this book.
    It does resemble Bookman swash (in the <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000085#characters\">version
    done by Jason Walcott</a> of Jukebox), and that even has a similar M, although
    the swash elements are not right. I think Jason's version is based on an older
    design for Bookman than the ITC version.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    number of swash\u2019. I couldn\u2019t find a good sample of it, though."

  body: "Goudytype is shown in the McGrew book, and the M is similar, but not identical.
    it has only swash capitals, no lower case swash letters.\r\n\r\nI looked again
    at Goudy Bold Italic, the ATF face that has the swash letters. The M is closer
    to the sample above, but still not identical (the lower curl is bigger than the
    sample posted), AND it is slanted. It does have a swash lower case, but the tails
    on the letters, like the m and n, are along the baseline, not below it.\r\n\r\nIt
    may be that the original was drawn using Goudy/Bookman samples as 'inspiration'.\r\n\r\n-
