body: "My way to generate an Arabic font.\r\n1.\tI had an Arabic font which included
  ALL Arabic glyphs from Unicode 4.1 and ready to generate it to produce TTF file
  to add Volt project.\r\n2.\tI made an encoding file (.enc) which included all of
  my glyphs.\r\n3.\tSorted it depending on this .enc. (I arranged them depending on
  my encoding file.\r\n4.\tPressed on Codepages\r\n5.\tGenerated the font.\r\n6.\tGo
  to Ms Volt to complete OpenType project.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\nI know that
  there are 4 ways to do generation in FontLab:\r\n1. By arranging font depending
  on Names mode (By pressing on Names mode button then generating)\r\n2. By arranging
  font depending on Unicode range (By pressing on Unicode range button then generating).\r\n3.
  By arranging font depending on Codepage (By pressing on Codepage button then generating).\r\n4.
  By arranging font depending on Index mode (By pressing on Index mode then generating).\r\n\r\n-
  Could you please tell me the difference between 4 ways and when we use them?\r\n-
  Is my way correct or not? (I know  that we can use any of four ways because Volt
  doesn\u2019t consider the arrangement but looks on font glyphs names themselves,
  but I would like to know the correct way which was used by the professional typographic
  designers)\r\n- What is the best way to produce ttf file?\r\n\r\nLooking for your
  soon response.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nPlease send a copy of your reply to h_afash@yahoo.com"

  body: "What you desribe are internal representations of the glyph set in FontLab.
    That is, the names, codepage, Unicode range or index options control how the glyph
    set is displayed in the FontLab font window. When making a TTF or OTF font, it
    doesn't matter which view you are in when you export the font.\r\n\r\nIn FontLab
    options, you should check that the setting is <strong>not</strong> to re-order
    glyphs when outputting the font. In this case, the generated font will have the
    same glyph order as shown in index mode (which will be the same as in names mode
    if you have sorted by .enc).\r\n\r\nVOLT works by both glyph names and order.
    You'll notice, for example, that groups in postioning lookups are listed by glyph
    order.\r\n\r\nPS. I recommend upgrading to FontLab Studio 5.0"

      could you please tell me your way when you generate the font? Because I want
      to use one way for one view to generate my fonts.\r\n\r\nPlease see attached
      file which was found in FL5. Is this the screen you talked about?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6288.png]"
