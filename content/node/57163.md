  body: It's something like Stymie Black, but the join in the <strong>K</strong> is
    more like Clarendon, and somebody had  a little fun with the serifs on <strong>E</strong>

    But I could be wrong; maybe somebody knows what this typeface is."

    a logo based on a font like Rockwell, Geometric SlabSerif or some other you've
    mentioned.\r\n\r\nBen."
