body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI would like to ask a help in identifying font for a company logo.
  \r\n\r\nIt's done approximately 6 month ago and is a straight font. Have no clue
  whatsoever what kind of font or to which font family it belongs to but the owner
  of the company says that it is not a custom made font but the \"designer\" used
  some sort of font for it. \r\n\r\nI'm also posting a picture of it.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a billion if someone can help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/molluskLogo_4557.jpg]"

  body: Maybe it's a font, or maybe its a Neutraface M with vector drawn "ollusk"
    all of these letters have geometric shapes that point to being "drawn" in illustrator,
    particularly the sharp corners on the L and U

  body: This definately is handywork, not a font. The curves and the spacing are terrible.
    Custom made by a designer is no guarantee for quality, thats for sure.
