body: 'Hello all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on my first attempt at a complete typeface.
  It may be ambitious on the first time out, but I figure it&#39;s the best way to
  learn. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to develop a text face that incorporates the readability
  attributes of a serif but retains the spirit of a &#34;traditional&#34; sans. I
  want to stay away from the elegance of Optima, and lean more towards a true sans,
  while still pushing the stroke contrast and such. I guess it&#39;s a gray area I
  will have to explore, hopefully with your help. <BR> <BR>Here are my initial lc
  pencil drawings. There are obviously still a lot of problems with the axis in some
  of the letters. I want a vertical axis. Also, please note that none of the strokes
  are meant to be flared. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67405.jpg"
  alt="roman sans"> <BR> <BR>Here are my thoughts as I develop it: The e, k, l and
  j feel like what I&#39;m going for. Some of the other letters feel too &#34;pretty&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>Also, after I get the basic shapes and proportions right, I&#39;d like
  to add a little more character to some of the forms. The h, m, n and u feel lifeless,
  for example.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love comments as well as perhaps some guidance in
  the technical aspects of developing this typeface, like translating it accurately
  to vector art and then into Fontographer. But one step at a time... <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: Eric, <BR>looks promising, but there are several problems. The middle bar
    of &#39;e&#39; is going the wrong direction. For the shape of &#39;b&#39; look
    at your &#39;q&#39; which is much better. &#39;v&#39; is too narrow. &#39;x&#39;
    has no stand on the left side, the base is too narrow. &#39;k&#39; is too wide
    at the bottom and too narrow on top. Diagonal of &#39;z&#39; is too heavy. &#39;c&#39;
    and &#39;s&#39; need improvement at their beginnings and ends. &#39;l&#39; is
    too Meta-like and doesn

    the bar of the e is wrong? What about the q is more correct than the b? I chose

    on the next pass. <BR> <BR>As Jurgen noted, it&#39;s feeling a bit Meta-esque,

  body: 'I see a bunch of existing fonts in this, but nonetheless I think it can turn

    go at it! <BR> <BR>Your hand sketches were looking a bit too Optima, but this
    digital rendering is encouraging. In terms of even color, there&#39;s no way we
    can tell from a screen image - gotta see a PDF. The &#34;b&#34; is a bit wide.
    The terminal of the &#34;j&#34; is unconvincing. As for the &#34;e&#34;, I would
    be cautious, but not so rejectionist: it could in fact turn out to be what makes
    the font most attractive to a large chunch of users. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: hrant, <BR> <BR>thanks for the feedback. Could you elaborate a bit on your
    comments about the j and e? If I&#39;m understanding what you mean about the e,
    I think it has the most personality in the group. I&#39;d like to retain that
    as much as possible. <BR> <BR>also, this may be premature, but I&#39;d love to
    get your feedback down the line with regards to readability. I&#39;m trying to
    use this to learn and explore why certain forms are more readable. I&#39;d like
    this font to be as utilitarian as possible. <BR> <BR>eric

  body: 'The &#34;j&#34;: it just looks like the descender is being &#34;interrupted&#34;,
    somehow. The &#34;e&#34;: it&#39;s certainly an unconventional form; this doesn&#39;t
    mean it can&#39;t work, but it does mean its merit hasn&#39;t been &#34;proven&#34;
    via extended mainstream usage. So you have to try it out in actual printed text,
    show it to people &#40;the right people&#41;, take a break from it and come back
    later &#40;like a month at least&#41; to see if you still think it works, etc.
    <BR> <BR>Readability: you really have to make some &#34;internal&#34; decisions
    first, like how to balance readability versus style &#40;since neither can ever
    be total&#41;; and how you&#39;d like this font to be used &#40;large text in
    a magazine, small type on labels, or what&#41;. There really is no generic solution
    that can make a design good for everything &#40;although you could say some uses
    are much more common than others, and it might make sense to target that mainstream
    primarily&#41;. <BR> <BR>One big factor in readability though is variance &#40;which
    it seems you&#39;ve already noted&#41;. It&#39;s hard to glean your stance on
    that from the digital glyphs, but your hand sketches are encouraging - you&#39;re
    putting some nice &#34;spin&#34; among letters that tend to be too close. I think
    the &#34;a&#34; could have a smaller bowl, the &#34;t&#34; slightly more presence,
    the &#34;w&#34; a shorter middle peak, the &#34;y&#34; a stronger tail, and the
    &#34;f&#34; a stronger beak. I think the descenders could be slightly shorter
    &#40;or the ascenders longer, depending on the font&#39;s intended usage&#41;,
    and the &#34;g&#34; is a bit too classical &#40;although it&#39;s highly readable&#41;.

    <BR> <BR>A lot of problems, I know. I&#39;d like to get some impressions and feedback

    point, rather than technical, but of course all comments are welcome. <BR> <BR>Personally,
    I feel like I designed myself into a corner... And now it feels like Optima, which
    I didn&#39;t want it to feel like. There are several letters I really like, so
    maybe I need to apply the spirit of those to the ones I like less. <BR> <BR>I
    set out to design a sans with higher contrast in the strokes, but after looking
    at the results, I&#39;m not thrilled. I&#39;m discovering the low contrast of
    most sans serifs is what gives them that sans serif &#34;feel&#34;. The higher
    contrast makes the letters more elegant, and I wanted something more robust and
    contemporary.'
