The scan is from a predictably wonderful article by Ovink in an old issue of Quaerendo, which also happens to have a reference to that superb Deberny font that came up in the Javal thread. Apparently there was a reaction to all the Didone typography during the bulk of the 19th century, and this design was one of the seminal works in the resultant &quot;old-style&quot; revival, which was however superceded by Morris's Arts &amp; Crafts revival soon afterwards. Shame, since I think the A&amp;C stuff was somewhat provincial, or at least naive. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

As for &quot;y&quot;, that skewed thick arm does look funny, but ever since I saw it in that Deberny #17/#18* I've actually liked it. It seems to be a weight distribution scheme. <BR> <BR>* <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_18.gif" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_18.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_18.gif</a></a> <BR>I'd make the &quot;v&quot; symmetrical however. <BR> <BR>The spacing though seems a bit loose in spots (although apparently this design was considered tight for its era), but being metal makes it harder to space with consistent tightness. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I just wonder why nobody has revived any of that stuff (I do know that Ponot/IN made a digital version of Perrin's designs - but the Perrin sample in the Ovink article isn't very encouraging to me - Jannet's stuff is gold). It really seems that the second half of the 19th century is an untapped fountain (sorry for the bad joke). It makes me think: Mais</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What you mean by  <BR>&quot;the elzevir stuff isn't really the same as Morris's.&quot; <BR> <BR>For Ponot, Mandel and others, Perrin and Jannet are the first revival of Old Style typefaces, long long before Morris and others. Just that part of history generally don't appear on standard Anglo-US typography books. <BR> <BR>For Perrin its pretty clear, as described by Ponot in its 2 books. He wanted typefaces who by its forms reflect old text he want to publish. 19th typefaces don't fitted well, so he tried to find old typefaces, and used one existing old italic, and designed a Roman lc to fit with. Its caps are already done to do the titling for his HUGE book on Roman Lyon Inscriptions. I describe the Italic as a pure Garalde, when the Roman is more an Incised Garalde, perhaps the first text face of the category at this time? <BR> <BR>Perrin was one of the first typefaces revival done at the original ANCT (Imprimerie nationale), roughly 1987 by Jean Renaud Cuaz and Ronan Le Henaff under the direction of Mandel. Then, later later, the Imprimerie Nationale asked to Franck Jalleau, their in-house type designer to do a digital version who is used ONLY in the Ponot book you refer. <BR> <BR>About Jannet, there is less stuff about it.
