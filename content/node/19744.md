  body: "Looks good. \r\nSome of the characters don't seem wide enough like the a,
    e, h, k, s, m, n and u. I'd probably redesign the w. \r\n\r\nI think stylistically
    the clamp-like shapes your using give the font a very utilitarian/ strong look
    which really works with the b, d, g, p, q and r. They don't work as well with
    the h, m and the n. The point on the top of the p seems to work but i think with
    these letters it's too distracting. \r\n\r\nThe lowercase o also could be redone
    so it has a more consistent weight with the rest of the font. \r\n\r\nIs there
    an uppercase? How does it look in text? \r\n"

  body: "Wow, very nice. That \"e\" is da bomb.\r\n\r\n- I would shorten the descenders.\r\n-
    The right side of the foot serifs in \"f\" and \"r\" should be longer.\r\n- I
    might tilt the head serifs in \"i\" and \"j\" (and maybe \"u\") downward.\r\n-
    k: needs more presence.\r\n- o: might actually work!\r\n- r: beak join crappy.\r\n-
    s: super.\r\n- t: too wide.\r\n- v, w: not enough character. Try bending stuff.\r\n-
    y: tail too clunky.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you make lighter weights, apply high stroke
    weight contrast.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
