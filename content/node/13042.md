body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI have a few questions for those of you who are experienced
  in using \"Anchors\" in Fontlab.\r\n\r\nI am a student of linguistics. At our institute
  we are currently trying to make a font with advanced accent capabilities. For instance
  we'd like to have a simple way for putting multiple accents (>2) on a base glyph
  (see attached picture of a \"long syllabic stressed r\").\r\n\r\nFor this purpose
  the \"Anchors\" feature seems very useful. It seems to me, though, that anchors
  work only within Fontlab and cannot be understood by an ordinary word-processing
  program. Is that true?\r\n\r\nWhat has OpenType got to do with anchors or how could
  I make use of OpenType features for solving the problem (smartly and elegantly,
  may I add?)?\r\n\r\nThank you"

    it's a Microsoft thing, so how and when will I be able to actually use these features?
    Well, I may be not getting something here ...\r\n\r\nAny VOLT experts around?
    Is it possible to use VOLT in Fontlab?\r\nAt least I have applied for joining
    the VOLT community, which is closed to a critical public."

    You work on your font files in it outside of FontLab (or any other app).\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure that there are some applications that you can test these fonts in, althought

    to write a little bit of code in the OpenType features window using lookups. Unfortunately,
    Fontlab 4 \"can support only ... single and pair positioning. We expect to support

  body: "David, I've done a lot of work with complex script fonts involving OpenType
    GPOS mark anchoring (Hebrew, Arabic and Thai), and also know the people who have
    added IPA support to a lot for fonts for the next versions of Windows.\r\n\r\nI
    make the outlines in FontLab, but do all the mark positioning and other OT Layout
    stuff in VOLT. This is the only tool that supports all the OTL lookup types that
    you will need to do dynamic mark positioning.\r\n\r\nThe version of the Uniscribe
    shaping engine that ships with MS Office 2003 on Windows (and I believe the one
    that ships with Windows XP Service Pack 2), supports such GPOS mark positioning
    for that Latin script, including the IPA extension. So if you have a font that
    supports the <mark> and <mkmk> features you should be able to use it effectively
    in Word and other Office apps right now.\r\n\r\nNote that the Mac version of Office
    does not support OTL features yet. On the Mac side you could try Mellel, which
    has pretty decent OTL support, or any other software that uses the OpenSource
    ICU library for text layout.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore heading off down the AAT path,
    you should check what applications are actually going to be available to work
    with the font. Although AAT support is built into Mac OS, it is not actually used
    by many applications. Also, note that AAT does not use anchor mark positioning,
    so you have to include dozens of different mark glyphs at different heights and
    horizontal offsets and contextually substitute them. This aspect of AAT is particularly
    poor."

  body: "Thanks a lot, John.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a surprise for me to learn that Word
    2004 (for Mac) is in fact inferior in functionality to Word 2003 (for Windows).
    I was suspecting that, though.\r\n\r\nI have never fully understood \"activation\"
    of OpenType features, perhaps you can help me there: As far as I know, features
    must be switched on or off, eg through a drop-down menu (in InDesign). In Word
    2003 you can't do that! Does that mean the <em>mark</em> and <em>mkmk</em> features
    are \"on\" by default?\r\n\r\nThen there's the lack of detailed manuals or documentation.
    I am no professional type engineer so I am dependent on those. Most examples I
    have encountered are the \"easy\" ones, a <em>liga</em> feature perhaps and an
    <em>onum</em> feature and the regular developer is set. I haven't found much information
    on the features important for my project (using latin script). Well, I guess it
    takes some time to get accustomed to VOLT, I have only just started. Unfortunately,
    VOLT does not support Type-1 fonts nor CFF-Flavoured OpenType fonts, does it?\r\n\r\nRe
    AAT: I won't go \"down that path\" for now."

  body: "OpenType layout features are expected to be in one of three states: on by
    default and impossible to turn off (e.g. <rlig> for the Arabic lam_alif ligature);
    on by default but able to be turned off (typical for 'standard' ligatures such
    as ffi, fi, etc.); off by default but able to be turned on (typical for discrtionary
    ligatures such as ct, st).\r\n\r\nThe individual feature descriptions generally
    indicate in what state a feature should normally be, but this needs to be intepreted
    by applications, and may be subject to the limitations of their user interfaces.\r\n\r\nIn
    the case of Word 2003, you have pretty good language processing support, but poor
    typographic support. So this means that features that should be on by default,
    which include the 'mark' and 'mkmk' features, because they are essential for proper
    language display, are supported, but because of the UI limitations they cannot
    be turned off even if this would normally be expected. So, for example, Word support
    for the Arabic script includes implementation of the 'rlig' and 'liga' features,
    but the latter cannot be turned off (other than by inserting a control character
    between the component characters of a ligature).\r\n\r\nIt is also important to
    note that Word implements OTL support via the Uniscribe script engine, which includes
    separate shaping engines for different scripts. So the layout features applied
    to support language shaping will vary from script to script.\r\n\r\nYou might
    find it helpful to read my essay on <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/Glyph%20Processing/intro.mspx\">Windows
    glyph processing</a>."

  body: "Making CFF OpenType fonts with VOLT:\r\n\r\nVOLT uses the TIDE, which is
    a font tool development environment that includes its own TT rasteriser. As far
    as I know, VOLT is the only tool that uses TIDE, which seemed like a good idea
    at the time, but no one else has implemented anything in it. One of the attractions
    of TIDE was that one was not limited to using the system rasteriser, but could
    plug in other rasterisers. However, TIDE does not include a PS rasteriser, which
    is why one can't work directly on CFF fonts in VOLT.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem
    is only in the display of glyphs in VOLT windows. <em>You can open CFF fonts in
    VOLT and compile OTL tables to them.</em>\r\n\r\nSo the work-around is to make
    a dummy TTF font that will be your VOLT working file. This needs to have exactly
    the same glyph set and order as the final CFF font, and also needs to have the
    same UPM value if you are doing any GPOS work. Generate this dummy TTF from your
    FontLab source, and open it in VOLT. Do all your VOLT development on this dummy
    TTF and, when you are done, <em>export a VOLT project file.</em> You can now open
    the CFF version of the same font in VOLT, import the project file, compile and
    ship a CFF master font containing the OTL tables that you developed using the
    TTF dummy."
