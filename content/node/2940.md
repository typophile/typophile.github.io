  check out the uppercase &#34;R&#34;  Hopefully someone is good with fonts.  I&#39;ll
  be checking in.  Thanks!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25366.jpg"

  body: It reminds me of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/windsor/" target="_blank">Windsor</a>
    or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/musketeer/" target="_blank">Musketeer</a>/Milton,
    but if one of those was used, it was only as a starting point for &#39;inspiration&#39;.
    This has a rather &#39;mutilated&#39; look to it, where width and maybe long distance

    the one by Philip Bouwsma!</i>&#41; that comes close... <BR>Unfortunately I cannot
    provide a link or sample.

  body: Rookledge&#39;s was no help neither. I think Mike might be right, <BR>this
    is most probably custom-fit.
