    time perceptible to begin with?

  body: "When you consider the real-time refreshing of gobs of small text in a layout
    app (especially on a typical third-world computer), it can matter. I believe rendering
    performance is why for example InDesign's optical spacing is (still?) based on
    a bilinear model as opposed to a more ideal fully-smooth model. Performance is
    also the reason MS has recommended Em-sizes that are powers of 2 (although some
    people dispute the latter-day relevance of this). And this is all in the realm
    of Latin, which is way less complex than Urdu for example.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    used an OpenType Nastaliq Urdu font may be anywhere from slow to unusable. In
    this case it''s shaping not rasterizing that slows things down. If that''s the
    area of interest I''ll point Sergey to this thread. '

  body: "I've seen different interpretations of term 'rendering': from glyph rasterization
    to text layout of entire document. You may want to clarify what you actually is
    trying to measure. \r\n\r\nLargely, rasterization speed is independent from text
    shaping performance using OpenType layout tables. Complexity of the script may
    require complex layout tables by itself. There are also fonts for simple scripts
    where designer planned for rich set of contextual forms or complex positioning
    rules, e.g. Segoe Scrtipt, Bickham Script Pro, or SBL Hebrew. However, this does
    not automatically mean exteremly complex outlines.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Also, the shaping and rasterization can be optimized in various ways. When
    I developed the contextual OpenType features for Zapfino Extra Pro, I noticed
    great performance differences between Notepad and InDesign. The same *large* amount
    of text took a very long time to initially render after pasting it into both Notepad
    and InDesign. But once first rendered, page switching and scrolling was fast in
    InDesign but still very slow in Notepad. This was most likely because InDesign
    was caching the glyph ids and their positions, and rerun the OpenType Layout shaping
    only when necessary (when a reflow occured), while Notepad did not have any chaching
    mechanism so it executed the OpenType code practically at every screen referesh.
    \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "I on purpose decided not to touch area of higher level text formatting code
    in my previous mail. There are two many things that can be measured or optimized
    for. This includes paragraph formatting, whole document pagination, automatic
    layuot, editing, scrolling, time to first page on screen/printer, WYSIWYG quality,
    memory consumption, loading time etc. You may prioritize and address different
    issues above and get different feel about application performance.\r\n\r\nLet's,
    for example, compare Notepad and WordPad. Notepad is much faster than Wordpad
    in shapng simple text (i.e. finding linebreaks within a the paragraph) and so,
    finishes formatting faster. But Notepad will not do anything, even drawing first
    lines, until whole document is formatted. Since it is frequently used to view
    huge log files, it takes seconds, sometimes minutes. Wordpad draws first page
    as soon as it is ready and allows scrolling while formatting for the rest of the
    document continues in the background.  Which one you think is percieved to be
    faster?\r\n\r\nI've seen enough performance problems on all levels of text stack,
    each of them made overall speed times or even orders of magnitude slower. I remeber
    Notepad(i.e. Uniscribe) in Windows 2000 drawing Indic text one line per second,
    now it is hundreds times faster. I know higher level components and applications
    that had been made 30+ times faster without changing a line in Uniscribe.\r\n\r\nThings
    are, font designer can affect basic things on font-facing text formatting level
    and rasterization. And I think it is safe to assume that faster font is, faster
    application works :). But all tricks and optimiaztion within application make
    it hard to measure performance of the font itself. This is why I like Notepad,
    it is absolutely straightforward, predictable, pure Uniscribe+GDI client, with
    basically no additional functionality beyond that. I am sure InDesign is much
    more advanced and performant in terms of formatting, cachig and screen rendering.
    But this is what makes Notepad a great tool for testing functionality and preformance
    of both Uniscribe and fonts. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"
