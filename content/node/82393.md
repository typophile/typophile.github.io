  outline 10)\r\n\r\nThe action created a number of extra glyphs which we superfluous,
  but understandable, as they were at intermediate points between existing nodes on
  the original line. Some of were actually necessary to keep the distance between
  tin in-line and outline consistent. \r\n\r\nWhat was a puzzling and a little annoying
  was that at random intervals - not in every glyph but often enough, Fontlab inserted
  nodes on top of each other and some nodes that effectiely folded the line back on
  itself.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any clues to why this happens or ways of preventing

  body: I suspect this is a result of the curve being kind of weird to begin with.
    I can't see the whole path, so I may be wrong, but that on-curve point is in a
    very awkward position that  doesn't really fit the technical definition of a well-drawn
    path. So it's probably not what the kind of path the code was written for.

    for this sort of thing.

  body: "Thanks gents.\r\n\r\nAwkward curves... perhaps, but not in every instance.
    I like to think it is something as straight forward as that because that I can
    recognize and fix. What I'm looking for is predictability.\r\n\r\nFOG I ain't
    got at the moment. Sounds like fun though. I can have a feast or I can have a
    famine.\r\n\r\nThe thing I was after was the drop shade effect and, while I can
    see how I'd be able get that with \"> Make Parallel Paths\", but not without an
    extra step or two which could result in an entirely new set of artifacts in need
    on a manual clean-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
