  (e.g to use in word on a letterhead)\r\n\r\nObviously its monospaced, is there a
  version that has the word spaces and letters kerned or do you think its worth doing
  myself?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    see any sense, at all, in 'dekerning' 'Courier' to loose the monospacing. :)\r\n\r\n<em>(
    I think you basically have two options: Using the original monospaced version
    of 'Courier' or choosing / considering a different typeface, altogether. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: "Hi, thanks for all the advice!\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use non system fonts
    in Word and Powerpoint and retain portability between different platforms and
    versions? I know there is the embed font feature but as far as I know it dosnt
    work very well and there is always the problem of having the right font setup
    on everybodys machine if they want to create a document using it....\r\n\r\nIve
    read one solution is to create pdfs of docs when sending to external people such
    as clients. Just wandering what everybody else does when they have to choose a
    font for clients to use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: ">That\u2019s quite displayish, isn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nWell, it is used pretty
    regularly to print excerpts of movie scripts in books, or whole scripts. Actual
    scripts have to be in Courier, because then they are approximately one minute
    per page, which is convenient for  comparison and production. But produced for
    reading, American Typewriter, which is proportionally spaced, is more readable.
    \r\n\r\n>portability between different platforms and versions?\r\n\r\nAmerican
    Typewriter comes in an <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/PurchaseOptions?familyid=3479&id[]=10035&id[]=11096\">Open
    type version</a>, so yes. \r\n\r\nYour work group would all need it on their machines
    for them to edit documents. Yes, PDFs work fine for distribution, but they won't
    be editable, I believe.\r\n\r\nI know some programmers and some lawyers use Courier.
    And I don't really know why lawyers want to use it. \r\n\r\nThere are really better
    options for almost every purpose, though.  \r\n\r\n"
