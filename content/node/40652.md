body: "Its been a good few years since I posted here.  I was dabbling my toes into
  the typeface pool by editing the Myriad letterforms for a personal logo and typeface.\r\n\r\nWell
  I have recently decided to make a new logo with a custom drawn typeface, this time
  without using an existing font as a basis.\r\n\r\nI originally just designed the
  letters m d t a, and then went on to make the other letters for the words design
  and media and thats where it stood, until I decided to do the remaining letters
  for fun, and then numerals and basic punctuation followed.\r\n\r\nNow half a year
  later, I have started redrawing the letters and making a more complete version.
  \ I have done the most work with the bold letterforms as that is what the logo is
  made from.  I have done lowercase, uppercase, smallcaps, 2 forms of numerals, and
  some simple punctuation.\r\n\r\nI have also started work on a regular version of
  the typeface, and I have only done the lowercase, and some uppercase with that one.\r\n\r\nSo
  far these are just lettershapes in Corel Draw, I would like to form it into a font
  with fontlab at some point, but I am not comfortable with fontlab's drawing tools,
  as I usually use corel draw, and feel that the vector shapes seem more solid and
  maliable, but I guess I will have to change if I want a working font from it.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I am talking too much, so take a look at the PDFs and please offer me some comments
  and criticism on how to improve it, while I am at this early stage, oh also, I have
  some alternative characters made which I would like to include in the font also,
  and a whole selection of Q designs.  Most of the lettershapes are based around the
  o design, which is a slightly squared off geometric circle.\r\n\r\n"

    I think you could do without the counter dots. Not really a point to them other
    than having been in the original logotype. Also I think the B is a little disproportioned.
    I'd make it slightly more even.

  body: "I'm thinking the overhang on all three \"s\" characters is a bit much...
    they feel off-balance, and not in the quirky intentional way that some of the
    other characters do. I second what Ken says about the dots, I don't think you're
    gaining much and when you use this as a typeface they will become a distraction.
    Plus, they're a great way to set the logo and text apart.\r\n\r\nIt's nice though,
    I like it a lot. The small caps in particular work for me."

    toughest for me to draw :)\r\n\r\nI have started drawing the letters in fontlab
    directly, instead of moving the ones from Corel, so once I have all the lowercase
    done, I will do a pdf.  I have never done a sample sheet before, so I may find
    an example of one and use that, would there be a problem with me doing that, I
    wouldn't want to offend anyone...\r\n\r\nmdta - Martin Anderson"

    started work on metrics, so they use a default setting of 0 left sidebearing,
