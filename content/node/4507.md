body: Hello folks, <BR> <BR>A client thinks this font is called &#34;Hunnypot&#34;
  and I recognised it as the typeface used on Winnie the Pooh merchandise. Am I right?
  If so, is it commercially available or known by another name because I can&#39;t
  find it anywhere. <BR> <BR>Regards <BR>PAUL <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/34490.gif"

  body: At a cursory glance, it does not appear to have been inspired by any of Ernest
    H Shepherd&#39;s original artwork. So I therefore conclude that it cannot be associated
    with Edward Bear, AKA Winnie-the-Pooh. <BR> <BR>Please note capitalisation and
    hyphens.

    font <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif" border=0>,
    once we&#39;ve ID&#39;d it.

  body: It seems your client is right about the name. <BR>Disney have a Flash game
    <a href="http://ads.disneyinternational.com/DisneyOnline/games/hunnypot/hunnypot.swf">here</a>
    which uses this font. <BR>It&#39;s called HunnyPot-DemiBold in the .swf file.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;Evil Disney sacrilege, mutter.&#41;
