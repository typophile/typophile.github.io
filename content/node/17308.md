  Western was founded in Chicago in 1868 by a family of German immigrants and primarily
  served the German newspaper market. The business was very unsuccessful and a year
  later was sold to Warren and A.E. Barnhart, newpaper publishers from Iowa. The Barnhart
  Brothers first got into the type business when they accepted type as payment for
  a debt and sold it. The Barnharts made Mr. Spindler, the foundry foreman, a partner
  and formed [[Barnhart Brothers and Spindler|Barnhart Brothers & Spindler]] foundry."
