  body: "With unique well designed fonts like this, Optimo would seem to have the
    chops to do just fine without listing on MyFonts. They are on my favorites list
    of font designers not listed at MyFonts. KLIM & Commercial Type are some others.
    BTW note from the prices that Optimo's products are for the carriage trade. If
    price is a consideration, similar fonts are the way to go.\r\nDon"
