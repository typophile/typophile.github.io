body: "Hey guys!\r\n\r\nI'm thinking on returning to typography once again (it must
  be the third time). I've been concentrating myself in code essentially for the past
  years and I think I will continue with it but every time I come around my type books,
  my \"still to finish\" work or whenever I receive some money from MyFonts on one
  of the fonts I have that I wouldn't use I think: \"Should I get back?\"\r\n\r\nSo,
  as somewhat a transition, \"what if I started by doing some scripts that would help
  me and other developers?\"\r\nI'm a pretty good developer so I don't think this
  would be that hard.\r\n\r\nAre you finding a lack in that subject? Something you
  would like to see done?"

    to do so! I can't do a thing there. Also... made an infraction by not making my
    username my name and there is no way to change it sigh..."

    and were asked to change it, which they did.\r\nAs for posting, upper-left under
    your avatar and name is a box which reads \"New Discussion\". Click on that and
    proceed. I think the appropriate Category would be Type Design Software for coding.
    You must be signed in to post."
