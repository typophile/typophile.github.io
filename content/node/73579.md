  body: If anything I/d see it more the other way round-italic is a cursive typeface,
    usually angled and with some of the aspects oh handwriting in it's letterforms.  Oblique
    is more usually just an angled form of a regujlar face-though this may be done
    by hand rather than in software, and may go beyond just a mechanistic tilting.

  body: "Generically/commonly one could call them synonyms.\r\n\r\nHistorically (and
    probably more accurately) italics is an actual separately drawn typeface meant
    to hint at aspects of cursive handwriting. The glyphs are drawn as unique glyphs
    from those drawn for the text face (though are meant to feel like they come from
    the same family in terms of size and style and weight).\r\n\r\nOblique, on the
    other hand, is usually more of a mechanical slanting of the standard glyphs rather
    than a re-drawing of the glyphs. \r\n\r\nThere's also the issue outside of the
    typeface itself when it comes to the wordprocessor. Smart wordprocessing software,
    when you click the italics style icon will swap out the current typeface for the
    italics version of the typeface. If there is no italics version, it will take
    the standard text face and distort it (obliquing it [is obliquing a verb?]). "

  body: "Nothing earthshaking, but:\r\nIn preparing my TypeCon talk I had to think
    clearly about definitions like this, and what I arrived at is close to what some
    others have already said:\r\n\r\nOblique is a mechanical skew of a Roman, possibly
    touched up (not more) to avoid too much ugliness. Sans fonts often have an Oblique
    (although they call them \"Italic\" for convenience/expectation) and these only
    stand out enough from the Roman if they have a strong slant.\r\n\r\nItalic means
    a font that might have started as a mechanical slant job, but in any case ends
    up looking structurally different. Serif fonts almost always have a so-called
    \"true\" Italic (although also almost always the Italic skews the voice of the
    Roman too much, typically by being far more chirographic). Slanted-Roman italics
    are interesting because they are essentially Oblique, but they [need to] have
    something extra (like semi-serifs instead of full serifs) to stand out enough.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
