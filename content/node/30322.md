body: "G'day Philers,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a logotype for Quakers Australia in part
  by customizing an exisiting typeface. I'm trying to make it gentler and finer.\r\n\r\nFirstly:
  Is it OK to customize letterforms this much? Am I treading in murky water licensing/copyright
  wise?\r\n\r\nSecondly: What do you think of the changes? does it look strange? do
  the thin strokes look like they belong with the thicks? Is there anything that really
  clangs? Should I abandon my efforts and go with the original typeface? \r\nNote:
  This is not a stand-alone word-mark, it has a device to go with it, so it doesn't
  so much need to be strong in that sense.\r\n\r\nSorry my questions aren't more intelligent,
  I guess I am looking for first impressions, state the obvious kind of stuff, I am
  not experienced at this by any means. Any help would be greatly appreciated,\r\nthankyou\r\n\r\n<a

    assuming this is far use under most licenses."
