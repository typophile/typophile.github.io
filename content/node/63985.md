body: "I'm considering purchasing either Skolar or Mokka, but considering the price
  of four basic styles will run me, I want to be certain before I buy. I've looked
  at online specimens of both, but in the past, I've fount that what may look great
  in that setting, or even in downloaded PDF specimens, ends up looking awful on-screen
  in Microsoft Word. (Might this be because I'm using Windows, and perhaps these typefaces
  were designed largely by Mac users for Mac users?)\r\n\r\nI'm not looking for free
  fonts, or to rip off foundries. What I'm hoping is that someone might be willing
  to set the attached word document (at least I think it's attached) in either Mokka
  or Skolar (ideally both, if you can), and embed the fonts so that they'll appear
  when I open the document. That way, I'll be able to see what they'll look like in
  actual use, without getting additional access to them before buying. (my email is
  mikebaranowski@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance to anyone willing to
  help me out. I know it's asking a lot, and I appreciate your assistance.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I'm using Word 2007, but honestly I can't tell much of a difference between
    that and 2003. I've tried ClearType tuning, turning ClearType off, and pretty
    much everything else. And I've ended up concluding that some fonts display poorly
    on Word in Windows (for whatever reason). I get that there's no real financial
    incentive to catering to the very small group of folks in my situation, but it
    sure would be nice to be able to purchase some fonts that display as nicely in
    the application I use all the time as they do in print.

  body: "Simon Robertson pointed me over here. Thanks Simon. \r\n\r\nThe fact that
    you don\u2019t like the PDF rendering, suggests that like many Windows users your
    preference has been tuned to crisp rendering of Windows and Office bundled fonts
    like Calibri and Cambria under Windows \u201CGDI rendering\u201D. These TrueType
    based OpenType fonts have had a level of hinting investment that few third-party
    font vendors can justify. Occasionally corporate clients, looking to roll out
    a corporate font across thousands of desktops, might be willing to invest in having
    a font hinted, but typically for font vendors selling to graphic designers (who
    are happy with the way Adobe apps render type) would have no need to. So really
    you have three options, live with the rendering, pick different fonts, or pay
    to have the fonts hinted.  \r\n"

  body: Hey Mike, I could be wrong, but I believe that http://www.lucasfonts.com/
    and http://www.daltonmaag.com/ have *office* versions of some of their fonts,
    I'm not sure if this means extra hinting, but they might be some good places to
    look too.

  body: "How are you planning to use Skolar?\r\n\r\nI've set it for long running text
    at sizes from 10-11 points and there's something that just doesn't feel right
    about it. Maybe I've become too accustomed to using warm, flowing faces like Dolly
    or Feijoa, but there's something rather jarring and distracting about Skolar when
    set at these sizes. I don't think it's appropriate for setting long running text,
    at least not at 10-11 points. The Skolar specimen pdf has it set smaller, I think,
    and it seems to work. \r\n\r\nIt shines as a web or display font, however. Go
    figure. "

  body: "The existence of these TrueType or TrueType-flavored specially-hinted fonts
    is a jolt to me. Considering that MS Windows is the preferred operating system
    (although perhaps not by type and graphic designers), and the ever-increasing
    level of digitally distributed documents, I should be thinking more about these
    fonts. Do they display better only with MS applications, like MS Word, or with
    other word processing and page layout (InDesign) programs as well? Do PDFs display
    better when viewed with Adobe Reader? How about with other PDF viewers? What about
    epub formats, which I don't really know too much about, viewed on Windows? Will
    these specially-hinted fonts continue to have a viewing advantage with Windows
    7 and the upcoming Office 2010? Is anyone reviewing these fonts to see how much
    better they look?\r\n\r\nWhat are the disadvantages of these fonts, besides limited
    font selection, cost, and, if the fonts are actually TrueType (as opposed to TrueType-flavored
    OpenType) as the Lucas fonts seem to be, no OpenType options?\r\n\r\nAnd where
    should I be getting more information about this subject. Thanks, J.Tillman"

    hinted.\r\n\r\nBut if those fonts had also looked bad when the finished document
    printed on your laser printer, then that would be surprising, and due to an actual
    discrepancy between what the font looks like in the specimen and what it looks
    like in actual use."
