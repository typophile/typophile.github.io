  kerning pair 'ch' to be precise. an image is attached below.\r\nfirst line with
  metric kerning, the second one with no kerning.\r\n\r\nstrangely, this kerning pair
  is only found in univers lt std\r\nand absent in the first postscript version and
  univers next.\r\n\r\nis this intentional or simply poorly executed? \r\nit's somewhat
  against frutiger's 'tree approach' \r\nregarding letter spacing.\r\n\r\nnoto"

    i allowed to edit this kerning pair\r\nin the font file?\r\n"
