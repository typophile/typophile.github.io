    trying to figure out - out of all bibles - new testament, old, king george and
    manuscripts what&#39;s going to be the most recognizably &#34;bible&#34; but not
    definately not display faces because I don&#39;t want to take away from the creative
    &#40;an image on every page&#41; that I was going to lay out as if they were the
    illumination, woodcut illio , ect.  <BR> <BR>Considering too - this is being distributed
    to a bunch of designers - I think I gotta get the fonts right - or at least a
    good choice. body text is my major problem. Was thinking of going with unicals,
    somewhere in there, what do you think? <BR> <BR>haha - I was wondering if someone
    was gonna mention the steelplate gothic - was thinking it would be nice for tiny
    footers &amp; folio. <BR> <BR>any idea as to what faces you&#39;d think of for
    a  bible would be great

    <BR>Start with Gutenberg and go on up to the Dove&#39;s Press Bible, Bruce Roger&#39;s

    Advertising and Design....crossed with 2003 Awards&#34; layed out tiny tiny in
    the upper right hand corner in white. The book will be perfect bound - the cover
    resembling leather &#40;but fake, no budget here&#41; the inside pages to be 2
    columns I&#39;m thinking with that vertical rule in the gutter. the Left side
    page on spreads will have an image of the piece - the right side text - 1 major
    dropcap, first line indents on paras. At least this is what I can drum up so far.  <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t think I want medieval - just classic enough. Its going on superwhite

    of numbers separate the text. And passages that should impress you most are printed
    in bold. <BR>A whole different approach is Caflischs bible: <BR>Take it and read,
    without sacred respect. So I can experience itself: the powerful prosa of creation
    or Job, the music of the psalms, the criminal stories in the old testament, the
    difficult letters of st.paul, the stories of the gospels. <BR>All that is literature
    - very good literature. <BR>By this layout I can view myself - apart from my education

    a qualified religious authority, not an art director. Personally, I think it likely
    depends on the content for which you are designing: if you were producing a catalogue
    for hardcore porn videos, then I think it would be blasphemous in that it deliberately
    associates the imagery of sacred text with the scandalous and profane. Of course,
    the content of an awards book is still technically profane, but it probably isn&#39;t
    scandalous. Note that I&#39;m using scandalous in its theological sense, i.e.
    something that encourages sin in others or knowingly creates the opportunity for
    sin.'

    - very good and important&#41;  <BR>As a theologian and pastor I&#39;m &#40;normally&#41;
    very aware of blasphemian content &#40;and there is a lot of hidden blasphemy
    in ads, and a lot of things I don&#39;t agree with and don&#39;t like, as there
    is blasphemy in political, economical positions and sometimes even in positions
    of churches as history shows&#41;. <BR>If I have had any suspicion of blasphemy
    I wouldn&#39;t have contributed anything here. <BR> <BR>I see it as harmless aping.
    Maybe even - if it&#39;s well designed - it recalls a sense for biblical word
    as a good side effect. <BR>In the bible itself you can find lists of people, families,
    soldiers, even lists of payment &#40;and lists of sin and sinners ;-&#41;   &#41;
    and so on, because the bible &#40;in the old testament&#41; keeps track and memory
    of people - a sign of care. In this sense I can agree with the bible design -
    some sign of difference, ironical modification provided. And the last points I
    think can be seen in thee outter form and the context in which the book appears.
    <BR> <BR>On the other hand: The use of the cross on the cover could - if I think
    twice - bother me a little. Could it be that religious importance is applied to
    design and advertising ?&#42; I for example don&#39;t like books named as &#34;bible&#34;
    if they aren&#39;t - excepted if it&#39;s clearly ironic - for example I dislike
    &#34;The Macintosh Bible&#34;, &#34;The Windows Bible&#34; and so on, because
    the content is not worthy of such high word as &#34;bible&#34; and computers shouldnt
    get that respect.  <BR>For me that spot of bothering would immediately disappear,
    if the text on the cover wouldn&#39;t form a cross. With black/white, the position
    and so on there is enough reference to the bible-look to keep that concept. And
    there is no problem for me in the design of the inside pages. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Perhaps I should say it this way: It is a problem of the direction of sense/meaning.
    The aping of religious design isn&#39;t blasphemic and I don&#39;t have any problem/bothering
    with it &#40;except of sometimes  tasteless things you can see&#41;. Religion
    itself and its design should have enough power to stand that and there is no need
    to be strict. Sometimes even it is good and prophetic to ape forms - for rethinking
    and changing them. &#40;a sideway thought of me: that black design of bibles for
    example with the strict white line-cross does&#39;nt show the liveliness of the
    word inside, see for better the rich and joyful design of old bible manuscripts&#41;
    <BR>But if - in the other direction - profane things are raised to religious importance
    that&#39;s indeed problematic. <BR> <BR>'

    the beliefs of all three religions without insulting their believers.  <BR> <BR>I
    am not a Christian, but I think using the Cross in a mocking or silly way is in
    poor taste, including the example in this thread.  <BR> <BR>The issue is using
    symbols that are sacred to some in a way that negates their sacred symbolism.
    There may be a legitimate place for that by, for example, a person offended by
    the practices of the religion they grew up in. But to do so lightly, whether you
    are an insider or outsider I think shows a lack of taste and good manners.  <BR>
    <BR>I think that the &#39;Macintosh Bible&#39; etc are fine, and using the 2-column
    format etc. are no problem, because there is no claim of sacredness or abusing
    sacred symbols.    <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: If someone mocks something in a way that others might not deem respectful,  then
    you are at risk of insulting those others. Even if those others aren&#39;t your
    market, and maybe they won&#39;t even see what you are creating. -- I agree with
    John&#39;s comment about content. <BR>
