  . \r\nthings is  i want to add kerning feature  for a single glyph with certain
  glyphs so it wont affect any next  glyph.\r\nso in fontlab it is not possible so
  i was  trying this in VOLT . in volt it works fine after compiling. but when i tried
  \ to use in real world ( in IL, PS)  nothing has happened.  if missing something?
  i tried to export feature so i can edit them in FL but fontlab cnt read that lookups.\r\nor
  volt do positioning for Unicodes only?  \r\ni dont kno really \r\n\r\nany comments?

  body: Kerning adjustments add or remove cumulative width, which will affect subsequent
    glyphs in the line, as you have discovered. Mark positioning should be done using
    anchor attachment positioning, not kerning. The mark glyph itself should be zero-width,
    and needs to be classified as a mark in the VOLT glyph data (this gets written
    to the font GDEF table), then in the VOLT GPOS editing window you need to select
    'Anchor attachment' from the lookup type list, enter the base glyph names in the
    first glyph column and the mark names in the second column.  Note that you should
    name the anchor e.g. 'AboveMark', replacing the 'DEFAULT' anchor name. For Indian
    scripts, the mark positioning lookups need to be associated with the appropriate
    positioning features, in this case Above Base Mark Positioning ('abvm').

  body: "Think of it this way:\r\n\r\nPair positioning is expected to have an effect
    on the position of subsequent glyphs in a string. So, for example, if I use a
    pair positioning lookup to kern the 'o' to the 'T' in 'Tomato', I expect the 'mato'
    glyphs to move along with the 'o'.\r\n\r\nAnchor attachment positioning is expected
    *not* to have an effect on the positiong of subsequent glyphs in a string. This
    is why all secon dglyphs positioned in this way need to be classed as Marks, and
    need to be zero-width. They are positioned independent of subsequent glyphs.\r\n"
