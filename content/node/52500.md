  that I'm actually scared to look at it. The design and functionality are fine, but
  have been swept away by recent technological web developments, and the design has
  only ever been a patch-up job from the start - as the site is a monster. I re-branded
  it using Gotham Rounded about four months ago, but as I say - a patch-up.\r\n\r\nSo,
  I saw something that piqued my love for Avant-Garde Ligatures, the (cool) Seventies
  and the beauty of simple lines and curves. I also love the way that it looks like
  interlinked pieces of paper...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/interlinkedGlyphs_5882.jpg]"
