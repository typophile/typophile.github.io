  body: "Diversity is great, provided it demonstrates a consistent design vocabulary,
    or something like that.\r\n\r\nSometimes a portfolio should be about showing the
    full breadth and depth of your abilities, but more often it is to present a sufficiently
    reliable vision that a potential customer can point to it and say \"I want something
    like that\".\r\n\r\n"

  body: I was not intentionally stating that the best portfolios are always diverse,
    though it read like that in relation to the topic. I've now edited the link :)
