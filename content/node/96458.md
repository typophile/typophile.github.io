    be searchable. Printed books are easy to use, don't crash, don't run out of battery;
    you can write in them, hand them down, discover them in used-book shops; the design
    possibilities of print are limitless \u2014 dozens of colors, different types
    of paper, no size restrictions, die cuts, embossing, binding methods \u2026 It
    took printed books 500 years to evolve to the point they're at now. Maybe in another
    five hundred years digital books will work as well as print.\r\n4. Very important.
    It grounds the book in the world. It makes it last. It clarifies what it means
    to own a book. I don't consider digital books to be \"published\" in the same
    way printed books are.\r\n5. Keep printing.\r\n6. Very interesting point \u2014
    very Orwell. Yes, I suppose, the intangibility of electronic data is inherently
    opposed to archiving.\r\n\r\nIn case my stance on e-books isn't clear just yet,
    I'm embarking on a project called Perks of Print (www.perksofprint.com), which
    I will write up here when I have something to show for it, which involves the
    physical destruction of e-readers by means of the same techniques that makes printed
    books beautiful."

  body: "<blockquote>Do you prefer reading a printed book or a digital book? Why?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    prefer digital books in e-Ink* as long as the content doesn't depend on being
    large or colorful - which however does tend to exclude most of the books I would
    personally want to read.\r\n\r\n* I don't believe emissive screens are good for
    getting truly comfortable.\r\n\r\nWhy digital: because it's elegant on a number
    of levels. There are many ways in which physical books are quite clunky.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>How
    has the process of reading been transformed by technology?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of the mechanics of reading, not much at all (sadly).\r\n\r\nIn terms of
    the psychology of reading, it's been adversely affected by the ease of accessing
    audio and video material instead.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>How much of an influence
    can the medium of presentation (ie. book, magazine, ipad, laptop, web browser)
    have on the interpretation of the content?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt has a very big
    influence, especially when it's a novelty.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>How important do
    you consider tactility to us as participants in a publication?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNot
    very. Once you get immersed in a text you forget what your hands are doing.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    a book is an idea - it doesn't have to exist physically to make its mark.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>As
    publishing becomes more internet-based, how can we ensure the longevity of our
    information?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe Internet promotes longevity; but it doesn't
    promote focus.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Do ebooks provide the same kind of snapshot
    of history that an encyclopaedia would, or is history \"edited out\" as the ebook
    is updated?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHistory gets edited in any medium; and any \"snapshot\"
    is misleading.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Do you see an issue with the requirement of
    an electronic device and internet connection to access ebooks?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nA
    live Internet connection should not be required to read a book.\r\n\r\nBut I'm
    not sure I understand all of your question.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>How heavily do
    we rely on secondary technologies to access stored information?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    don't think I understand the question.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>the physical destruction
    of e-readers by means of the same techniques that makes printed books beautiful.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHuh?\r\n\r\nBTW
    printed books are only beautiful because we've been told they're beautiful. What's
    really beautiful is the idea and action of communicating.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>Do you prefer reading a printed book or a digital book? Why?</blockquote>\r\nIt
    depends on the content and the context. Generally, for larger technical books
    as a matter of convenience, tagging/bookmarking and ease of transport I would
    prefer digital. For highly visual content, something like, [[http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/photography/all/05744/facts.frederic_chaubin_cosmic_communist_constructions_photographed.htm|<em>Cosmic
    Communist Constructions Photographed</em> by Fr\xE9d\xE9ric Chaubin]], while I
    am open to the possibility, I do not see how a digital device could (currently)
    do justice to the content. That said, personally I also enjoy the weight of a
    book like that, not in terms of the perceived or actual value of the object, rather
    it is nice to be seated at a desk or in a good armchair and have the absolute
    presence of the object, preferably with a glass of French Malbec.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>How

    on content, context, device and environment. The question is not specific enough
    either, which technology and in what context? The [[http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/63138|Penguincubator]]
    was/is technology but I assume that is not what you mean...?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>How

    depends on the bias of the content creators, distributors and readers.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Do
    you see an issue with the requirement of an electronic device and internet connection
    to access ebooks?</blockquote>\r\nNo more or less than I view the requirement
    of a television, computer or other display interface to view visual content as
    an issue. They are a means to an end and if I am not interested in the end result
    then I will not bother with the means to get there.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>How heavily

    printed books, but if the book is primarily text I prefer an ebook simply because

    books don't last forever either. The vast majority of printed books are not best-sellers
    and are soon forgotten and difficult to find. Even books that are carefully saved
    can wear out eventually. I used to work at a public library and we regularly discarded
    books from damage due to water, mold, insects, or accident, or they just wore
    out. Digital storage actually makes it easier to keep copies of large numbers
    of books. A big challenge though is when books are kept electronically on media
    such as CDs, etc as technology changes quickly and storage methods that were popular
    in the past become obsolete.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> More convenient.\r\n\r\nReally? It might weigh less, but you need a device
    to read it on, which has to be charged and have batteries, or be plugged in; you
    need suitable lighting conditions to see the (backlit) screen; your device is
    much more likely to be stolen, or to crash, or otherwise suddenly stop working;
    you need an internet connection or some similar method of getting books \u2026\r\n\r\nDigital
    media are not archival quality. A printed text can survive without its binding,
    but a digital text cannot survive without a device on which to store it. Even
    the entirety of the internet is not simply \"out there\" but stored on servers
    around the world. The internet is only as good as the machines that hold it. If
    the power to the servers is cut, there goes your webpage.\r\n\r\nOf course the
    internet, for all intents and purposes, is stable and not going anywhere. But
    the point is that anything digital is dependent on a device \u2014 other than
    the human eye \u2014 that can decode it. What does an e-book look like when you're
    not reading it? For that matter, what does it look like on a different device?\r\n\r\nFrom
    the perspective of a book designer, e-books are terrible! And this is not coming,
    by the way, from someone who's been in the industry for decades and can't stand
    change \u2014 this is coming from a college student who is really just starting
    out and frightened by the speed with which designers and publishers are going
    digital. To look at this purely from a design/typography perspective, it is nearly
    impossible to make an attractive, effectively designed e-book. And even if you
    can, it will look completely different on one reader than on another.\r\n\r\nDoes
    no one miss the freedom to choose a paper, a font, a size, margins, leading, colors
    \u2014 in other words, to design? Try to make a foldout for an e-book. Try to
    make an e-book with a deckle edge. [This is what I was referring to above, and
    these are indeed things that I will be attempting in the coming months.] Hyperlinks
    are nice, but are they nice enough to warrant abandoning decent typography?\r\n\r\nI'll
    stop ranting for a second, because I do want to hear some other opinions. So,
    anyone who does prefer e-books, I would be very interested in hearing more about
    why.\r\n\r\nAlso \u2014 thank you, Bradley, for starting this thread. This is
    a topic that's been on my mind and it's great to see other people's responses
    as well."

    you are living very much off the grid I daresay that an EMP or HEMP would rob
    you of that opinion pretty quickly. It is not only the digital devices that you
    personally use in your day to day life but those that regulate other things you

  body: "I'd like to chime in because, unlike most people, I <em>generally</em> prefer
    reading on an electronic device.\r\n\r\nWhen I was growing up, the beauty of Internet
    access was mostly that I suddenly had access to a great deal of specialized information
    that I would never be able to find at the library. I would stay up long into the
    night reading 9pt, pre-ClearType text on a blurry CRT. The technological state
    of electronic reading today closely resembles a what I dreamed of back then.\r\n\r\nEveryone
    says they prefer the physical artifact of a real book, and I usually remind them
    that that's what we used to say about CDs, although books at their best are more
    charming than CDs. Still, I find the typical book annoying. For all we talk about
    well-composed pages and the feel of the paper and that lovely smell, most books
    offer the distractions of thoughtless layouts, bad gluing, cheap paper, and covers
    coming slowly unlaminated at the edges.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing the same content
    in print and on my tablet, I often marvel at how much crisper images can be on
    the IPS screen than in four-color offset.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the
    new flesh is content distribution. I still take some offense at being asked to
    pay the same amount for an e-book as for the real thing when the e-book is so
    much cheaper to distribute, probably even more carelessly laid out, and encumbered
    by some DRM that is likely to cause unforeseen difficulties accessing it at some
    point in the future. If e-books were half the price, I would likely buy three
    times as many. And I weep when I think of all the knowledge that is likely to
    be needlessly lost as orphaned works.\r\n\r\nStill, the future looks bright. At
    some point, we'll start focusing on the possibilities offered by beautiful electronic
    book designs in open, interoperable formats. I hope."

    the other hand most printed books are eventually discarded, especially ones by
    authors who aren't famous (which is the vast majority of books).  \r\n\r\nI used
    to work at a public library and we regularly discarded books that were worn out,
    moldy, contained outdated info, or just not in demand anymore. Libraries generally
    do this quietly because folks in the community react negatively if they see books
    in a library dumpster."
