  RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK is the typographically correct version of both characters.
  I ask with a case in mind in a typeface where the default quotes are mirrored from
  their usual look, but when one is using the right single quote as an apostrophe
  is not likely to be used that way.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/apostrofo_condorito_3772.png]\r\n\r\n(lettering
  from a Chilean comic magazine).\r\n\r\nI think that <a href=\"http://www.tipografia-montevideo.info/entevistas/archivo/e_heilborn.html\">in
  cases one want to have a different look for it due to being used as a letter</a>
  the U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE. is appropiate, yet <a href=\"http://www.languagegeek.com/typography/apostrophes.html\">some
  people is against the usage of those characters</a>. The usage of the Saltillo letters
  (U+A78B, U+A78C) as an straight apostrophe is safe, thought."

    feature, so that the \"one o'clock\" alternate glyph appears between two letters,
    but the \"eleven o'clock\" is default, when followed by a space or other punctuation.
