  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As always, I should preface this by mentioning I&rsquo;m blundering my way through this learning process and thus will likely sound like an idiot in my attempts to explain my current query.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been given the opportunity to take a close look at a pre-release version of an upcoming font (let&rsquo;s call it PRERELEASE) and one of the tasks still to be done is re-ordering the glyph index order. What I&rsquo;ve gathered is that the glyph index order designates the order glyphs are listed in InDesign&rsquo;s glyph palette (I&rsquo;m sure index numbers serve other purposes as well, so I suppose that&rsquo;s part of my query here).</p>
<p>What I began to be curious about was how to set up pop-up menus in InDesign&rsquo;s glyph palette; that is, to set up the small arrow in the bottom-right corner so that when you mouse-over the glyph a menu pops up with the alternates for that glyph. I had assumed there was some sort of code in the font file that set up this function, but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything of the sort. However, in beginning to re-order the font, suddenly those pop-ups began to appear when I loaded the font in InDesign.</p>
<p>As I haven&rsquo;t been able to find a standard index list, I simply selected another OpenType Pro font in InDesign and, based on its listing in the glyph palette, began reordering the PRERELEASE font. Many (most) of the expected pop-ups are appearing in InDesign&rsquo;s glyph palette, but not all of them.</p>
<p>For instance, mousing-over lowercase e pops up a menu with e, smallcap e, superscript e and scientific inferior e, which is great. However, the PRERELEASE font has over 10 alternate ampersands, and half a dozen alternate Qs, yet only the small cap versions of each of these is showing up in the pop-up menu. What I&rsquo;m wondering, then, is where should I place the alternate ampersands and Qs, etc.?</p>
<p>I should mention that I&rsquo;ve only re-ordered about 200 of the near 2000 glyphs in the font, but I thought I&rsquo;d post this query now rather than get too far ahead of myself.</p>
<p>If this makes any sense at all to anyone, I&rsquo;d appreciate any insight you might have to offer.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The glyph index order may best be thought of as the physical order of the glyphs in the font file. That&rsquo;s the order the glyphs are displayed in InDesign&rsquo;s glyph palette.</p>
<p>Ordering has no effect at all on what alternates are shown for a given glyph. This is instead controlled by OpenType layout features. The &lsquo;aalt&rsquo; feature in particular fives &ldquo;all alternates&rdquo; of a given glyph. I&rsquo;m not sure if InDesign will also show alternates that are not in &lsquo;aalt&rsquo; - perhaps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>My query was based primarily on the fact that the only change I&rsquo;ve made to the font is to re-order some of the glyphs in the Index codepage. In doing so, the pop-up menus in InDesign&rsquo;s glyph palette have changed.</p>
<p>For the most part, these alt pop-ups have appeared (small cap variants pop up for all basic uppercasae glyphs; small cap, superscript, scientific inferiors pop-up for each basic lowercase glyph, etc.), but in a few cases, those alt pop-ups have disappeared. I do understand that it is the OpenType features that enable the pop-ups, but I&rsquo;m trying to understand how the glyph index order impacts these pop-ups, because clearly that order does have some effect. I say this simply because in re-ordering some of the glyphs in the font I&rsquo;m working with, those pop-ups changed in InDesign. Specifically, the ampersand&rsquo;s pop-up menu in InDesign changed from including all 12 alt glyphs to suddenly only displaying the standard and smallcap variant, the 10 alt variants have disappeared from the pop-up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep tinkering and see if I can discover the mystery here, but if anyone has any input, please join in.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As expected, there was indeed more to the disappearing features than simply re-ordering glyphs (as Thomas suggested). It seems that in opening the font in FontLab some of the features were being stripped out, and I had to re-write them for the features to show up in the re-generated OTF file. All is well now and I&rsquo;ve learned a fair bit in the process. Lots of fun.</p>
<p>One question though: why, when I try to add a new glyph class to the list (eg: &ldquo;@class17 = [thisglyph thatglyph]&quot;), do I get nothing but errors on re-compiling the features? That question is probably way too vague, but perhaps someone will know what I&rsquo;m getting at.</p>
