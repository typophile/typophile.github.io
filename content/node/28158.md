body: "So I was tinkering around with an ambigram of my son's name (Sam) and was making
  very little progress with anything that looked good. A really cool guy from yayhooray
  came up with this \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/samiam2_3820.jpeg]\r\nand
  two other versions, both without the stroke and one a little bit lighter. \r\n\r\nI'm
  planning on getting this tattooed on me in the next week or so but after reading
  the ambigram thread noyz319 posted here (http://typophile.com/node/27688) and on
  yayhooray I thought I'd get some feedback from you experts. What do you think?"

  body: Works well as a tattoo, I think. Tattoos don't really follow the normal rules
    of typography, they're more of akin to the art of illustration. I mean, nobody'd
    make a tattoo with Helvetica, right? Althought that would be really cool. Hmmm...

    read Tam.

    or you wouldn't have posted for feedback.\r\n\r\nI would have struggled to read
    Sam if you hadn't already said. I read Tam too, and wam. I think there is a more
    elegant, fluid and legible solution. You just need to find it.\r\n"

  body: Work on the lower part of the s as it merges into the left-most loop of the
    'w'. I think curving that more might be enough to emphasize the 'S' without harming
    the 'm' too much.

  body: "Here's what I think: it's almost impossible to read, but that's OK for a
    tattoo, and as a tattoo it's alright (I'm not really a connoisseur of tattoos
    but to me it looks good). I'm otherwise a proponent of readability in a big way.
    But in a tattoo, does it really matter if nobody but the owner can see exactly
    what it says?\r\n\r\nOf course if you're having doubts (and since you're asking
    you probably do) you should give it more time, look at some alternative designs
    maybe. Once it's there it's hard to get rid of. And it's a fact that most people
    regret their tattoos. "

  body: "thanks for the feedback so far. and Termopolium i'm not having doubts about
    it, i just wanted to hear what some other people thought about it. you're right,
    the tattoo is really for the person whose skin its on not the rest of the world.
    \r\n\r\ni've been scribbling around with it at home a little bit but nothing i
    have done improves it i don't think, the current design is cool IMO. i know a
    guy who's planning on getting a tattoo of his son's birthdate tattooed on him
    (like 07.23.02 or 72302 or something like that) in a certain typeface. he considered
    avant garde. that could be cool too.\r\n"

  body: The top of the S is still looking a lot like a T or J. I would suggest trying
    some other ways to make the top of the S that look less T-like. I don't think
    it will interfere with seeing the m. Look at some blackletter fonts to get ideas.

    before you design a \"lifelong\"\u2026 \u2013 this style is (sooo) dated.\r\n\r\nPS.
    I really love blackletter, that's why i'm interrupting\u2026\r\n\r\n"

    your comments are right on, and before MW inks this permanently,\r\nI'm going
    to revise, and fix the S-T thing and the odd curve of the upper S,\r\namong other
    fixes.\r\n\r\n"
