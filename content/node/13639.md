  'wider' with a little more contrast.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/disorder/\r\n\r\nsomething
  like this:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/en/font.php?file=keyboard_plaque\r\n\r\nBut
  ideally it needs to be a proper commercial font with lowercase characters etc..\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas???"

  body: "Thanks for the replies.\r\n\r\nAnything from misprinted type is just a little
    too 'grungy' I am afraid. However Cartonnage looks good, but to be really fussy
    I need something without that stippling/eroded look at the edge. A rough edge
    is good just no 'erosion' if you see what I mean. I will keep looking but ny more
    ideas would be really helpful! "
