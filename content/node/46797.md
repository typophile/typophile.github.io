  body: This is handmade, look at the different i's, l's and e's, etc. Dom Casual
    is probably based on this kind of writing and would make a good substitute.

  body: "I believe this is in fact a typeface, not hand-lettered. In the original,
    the i's and e's look identical. I probably should not have gotten rid of the background
    with Photoshop, since my quick-and-dirty moves to do so altered the pixels a bit,
    inconsistently. Here's the original (from an Oklahoma fundraising license plate),
    though up-rezzed, otherwise it would be tiny:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plate5wlcscis2_4173.jpg]"

  body: Thanks everyone. Since it appears this was most likely hand-lettered after
    all, I decided to cut my losses looking any further on the font front. Just went
    ahead and started with Dom Casual Bold, then hand-modified it to match fairly
    closely. Redrew W, C, e, and  a from scratch, for the rest I modified the Dom
    glyphs. Could have spent more time redrawing new glyphs, such as the lowercase
    s and maybe v as well, but felt I'd put in enough time by that point and decided
    to call it good. (Has to match pretty closely, but perfectly exact not a requirement.)
    Appreciate the input!
