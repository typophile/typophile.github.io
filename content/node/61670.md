body: "Since I designed Mommie you can see a lot of script typefaces with big contrast
  for big sizes. With Narziss I created a roman interpretation with the very expressive
  Swirls version. Glenda is again an italic script like Mommie. In the Regular the
  characters join and it looks like a neatly written sprencerian handwriting. But
  like Narziss it has got a Swirls version too. Every glyph and swirl is carefully
  designed to work in every connection. Only use it very big.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/display/Glenda/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WassGlenda_5770.jpg]"
