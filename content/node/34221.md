  when trying to install it on a Mac or PC:\r\n\r\nI've attached the info from Fontlab.
  It's probably quite basic but my brains not working today. Any help would be most
  grateful.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\nDave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Have you tried running the font through the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/FontValidator.mspx">Font
    Validator</a> tool? From the kind of error message you are getting, I suspect
    the problem is not something like names or export options but problems with glyph
    outlines or hints affecting rasterisation.
