body: "Over at <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info\">our German type forum</a> people
  have been complaining about the missing support of unencoded glyphs in the character
  palette of OS X Lion. \r\nFrom what I could gather:\r\n\r\nIn Mac OS 10.6 you can
  select certain typefaces and the character palette would show you all glyphs of
  that font, even the ones without a Unicode value. From there you could do copy&paste
  for these unencoded glyphs, at least to most Apple and Adobe apps. \r\nIn Mac OS
  10.7 this option seems to be gone. (Couldn't check it myself, since I still wait
  for the FontLab Studio 5.1 update)\r\n\r\nIn Linotype\u2019s old FontExplorer version
  1.2.3 unencoded glyphs were also shown \u2026\r\n<img src=\"http://www.typografie.info/2/attachment.php?attachmentid=3231&d=1311611613\">\r\n\u2026
  but they are also missing in the recent version of FEX under the recent version
  of Mac OS. \r\n\r\nSo I am wondering: \r\nAre there any good reasons for companies
  like Apple and Linotype to drop the support for unencoded glyphs? Sure, the GlyphIDs
  are not as reliable as a Unicode value, but if you know what you are doing and the
  apps you use support it, that\u2019s a very helpful feature.\r\nEven if it could
  just be used for inspecting the character set of modern OpenType fonts with all
  their alternate characters. \r\n\r\nAnd what I am most interested in: <strong>Are
  there alternative character palette tools for Mac OS that support unencoded glyphs?
  </strong>\r\nOf course the Glyph Palettes in InDesign and Illustrator are good at
  that, but I can't really recommend people to purchase InDesign just to check the
  glyph support of their fonts)"

    has been part of Character Viewer for years now, and that is inconvenient for
    a lot of people.  I have not seen any explanation for it and have recommended
    everyone file feedback requests to have it put back.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\r\n\r\nAnother
    previous feature left out is the ability to identify a character selected in a
    text.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative you could try PopChar.  I have not done so myself
    and am not sure whether it will show everything in a given font or not."
