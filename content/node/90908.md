  the most recent issue of Grandin Road as all of their headline text, and the second
  can be found in both Kohl's customer service department and a magazine (from which
  the scan was taken; unsure of its name now).\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nhttp://s219.photobucket.com/albums/cc193/BeautifulPromise2621/?action=view&current=typeface2.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://s219.photobucket.com/albums/cc193/BeautifulPromise2621/?action=view&current=Typeface.jpg"
