  Offenbach will be there as well. And Adam Twardoch will be there. That leaves about
  990 or so other registrants\u2026\r\n\r\nroll-call?"

    I'll be in Berlin, since it premieres while I'm there\u2026\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "I don't know if my schedule will actually allow attendance, but I will be
    in Berlin May 20-24 and I was told that I'd have a pass for entry. Will Star Wars
    debut in Berlin at the same time as the US? When I was there last year, it appears
    that they were slightly behind on the films. If they debut it, I'd love to go
    see it.\r\n\r\nAnyways I'd be happy to meet up in the evening with anyone who'd
    care to get together.\r\n\r\njared\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The big films are timed to coincide with US releases. The German Star Wars
    premiere will be on May 17th (that's right, the 17th) in Berlin. On the 18th (when
    I arrive), it would be showing on limited screens. On the 19th, I suspect that
    there won't be a movie theater that is not showing it. The \"official\" German
    release date is on May 19th, just like the \"official\" US release date.\r\n\r\nSo
    you will be in Berlin from the 20th? During the conference, I'll be in the Linotype
    stand for the duration (stop by and pick up our new brochures!). On the evening
    of the 21st, I'll probably attend FontShop's closing party. But I'm game for anything
    on the 20th. I could see Star Wars then for (perhaps) the <i>third</i> time!\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    not only the US) are shown a slight delay in Germany.\r\n\r\nDan, I would love
    to but haven't got the money. Maybe you could later on share your impressions
    with us."

  body: "Don't worry mosh, I write and talk too much, so I'm sure that I'll end up
    putting something about TYPO Berlin together.\r\n\r\nLike last year, several other
    students from my school will be at the conference. Unlike last year, I'll be working
    in the Linotype stand instead of attending the lectures, so I won't be in the
    best position to write a good summary of the conference myself. But TypeOff is
    rebuilding its website, and we'll get an article up about the conference on it
    somehow.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    about something or other in regards to this and that. Dinner or drinks with busy
    Jared sounds fun.
