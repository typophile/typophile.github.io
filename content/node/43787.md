  each other in a book. I want to use Futura T1 Light for one, but I'm not sure which
  typeface to use for the other text. I know I want to use a serif face, but that's
  about it. I don't have any extra money to buy a type family, so I'm limited to pretty
  much what Adobe CS3 has to offer, unless I can find something else at school.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nBailey"

    don\u2019t set book type in Futura. Reading a book set in Futura is like having
    nails pounded into one\u2019s eyeballs. Head over to the library and try reading
    the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bauhaus-1919-1933-Taschen-25-Archiv/dp/3822850020/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207077544&sr=8-2\">Bauhaus
    1919-1933</a> to see what I\u2019m talking about.\r\n\r\nAnyway, your best bet
    alongside Futura is a face based on Futura. You can get Memphis light for $20
    on MyFonts, that\u2019s not a bad deal."

  body: "James,\r\n\r\nI know Futura isn't great for setting book type, but each page
    only has a small paragraph (no more than 60 words in Futura per page)\r\n\r\nI'm
    making a few versions of the book to start, so I'll see whether or not it is painful
    to read in the amount I'm using it.\r\nThanks for your help."

    well with Futura. \r\n\r\nIf you've got Joanna, that should also be a good match.

  body: "If you're going to use Futura, especially Futura Light, for any kind of text,
    the important thing is to track it V E R Y loose. The bigger the space inside
    the characters, the more space you need between them \u2013 so the light weight
    needs to be set looser than a bolder weight. And the default letter fit for Futura,
    at least the commonly available varieties, is much too tight. Open it up, and
    look at the difference it makes.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thank you all very much! However, I ended up going with Univers 45  instead
    of Futura. Even though I don't have very much text, it was still too much to read
    in Futura.
