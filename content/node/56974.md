body: "Hi all,\r\nThis is an old photosetting font which I am digitizing for my company.
  I would appreciate any suggestions for changes or improvements that can be done
  without losing the character of the original font. I know that the color needs to
  be made more even - any thoughts on that?\r\n\r\n(I tried uploading a pdf, but for
  some reason that is taking forever. I might put it on a different server if anyone
  is interested.)\r\n\r\n\r\n/M\xE5ns\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lariat_charset090408_4367.gif]"

  body: Looks like you could us a lowercase s with an upstroke for beginnings and
    combos like the p s in ipsum. I would also look for solutions to crashing descenders
    like f g as well. The size of your dollar and cent signs seem a bit odd, but perhaps
    the dollar is raised like a superior character.
