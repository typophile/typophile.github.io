    tho. Still think febreze is custom \u2019cause almost all of this stuff is."

  body: "Oust I believe is Timothy Donaldson'e Airstream. \r\nI think it may seem
    to have a similar feel, but overall maybe not very close.\r\n\r\nYou might try
    something like:\r\n\r\nOne of MIchael Clark's designs P22 Pooper, Sneaky or Sweepy.\r\nIf
    you open these up a bit and stretch a few things you could come reasonably close."

    so it took a while to post. I almost was going to add another suggestion similar
    to Michael's, but he pointed out there were letters from that other font that
    appeared to have been copied from Michael's. I suppose thats Off Topic here, though."
