body: "I have a family of fonts I'm building in FontLab. They are all using the same
  exact kerning data and kerning classes. For some reason, one of the fonts is giving
  me a \"serious error\" in Font Book that says there is a \"System Validation\" error,
  with no further details.\r\n\r\nI've tried taking a .vfb file from one of the working
  fonts, copying over glyphs from the font that's giving me trouble, and generating
  again. Same error. I think I've pinpointed the problem to be something kerning/class
  related, as if I copy/paste glyphs that AREN'T in a class and generate the font,
  I don't get an error in Font Book. But once I copy glyphs that are in a kerning
  class, I start getting the error.\r\n\r\nI'm pulling my hair out because I have
  no idea why this is happening. I've tried resetting the metrics and kerning, then
  adding the data from the SAME .afm file the other fonts use, no luck. Same thing
  with the kerning class files. Any idea what could be causing this?! If I can provide
  you with anything else that might help solve this, just let me know. I'm beyond
  desperate at this point..."

    to fix it. I don't suppose you have Metrics machine? \r\nOr how about a simpler
    solution, have you tried TTXing the font and see if you still get the error?\r\n\r\nI
    know, you'd rather know what the problem is, but..\r\nJason C"

  body: "I've considered looking into other programs, but I think that would end up
    being next to impossible at this point. The family I'm working on is a layered
    family, where every font has the same metrics/kerning, classes, etc. Making one
    font in a different program is just begging for more issues to pop up...\r\n\r\nI
    have no idea what TTXing is, but I'll look into it to see if it can help me out."

  body: TTXing is, I believe, the use of the program 'ttx', a nifty bit of software
    written in Python that lets you view every table in a font.

  body: You can get the OS X Font Tools from Apple's site at http://developer.apple.com/fonts/.
    It has a small utility that does the same series of tests as the Font Book validation,
    but generally gives much more verbose report. You'll also find some accompanying
    documentation with detailed instructions of how to use it.

  body: "Yeah, sorry, some jingo there. \r\nI just meant, run the otf file through
    TTX, which converts it into an XML file with the .ttx extention, then just run
    it through TTX again to convert back to otf. The odds are slim this would help,
    but I've seen weirder things. \r\n\r\nAll things being equal, Grzegorz's suggestion
    is probably more helpful"

  body: "Thanks guys. I've downloaded os x font tools and have started poking around
    the tutorial and info docs, not sure which part of it is used for testing fonts
    though...\r\n\r\nAnd I've downloaded TTX, but I'm not sure how to install it.
    I keep seeing things saying that there is an easy installer for os x, but I just
    see a bunch of python files. Do I have to install and use in using terminal or
    is it a stand alone application?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Nevermind, I figured out how TTX
    works and was able to convert my .otf to ttx and then back to .otf. Still doesn't
    validate... I'm still trying to figure out how to test fonts with os x font tools.\r\n\r\nEDIT2:
    Alrighty, figured out os x font tools' validator using the \"ftxvalidator\" command.
    Either this isn't ouputting any useful information or I'm doing something wrong.
    These just look like parts of an .xml or plist file... not sure how helpful they
    are. Screenshot below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot

  body: Running <code>ftxvalidator</code> with just a filename gives you a report
    summary, nothing more. Run <code>ftxvalidator -T /path/to/font</code> for a detailed,
    tabular report. See also <code>ftxvalidator -h</code> (help) for all options available.
