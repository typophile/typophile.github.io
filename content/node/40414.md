  is my first post.\r\n\r\nI have recently purchased the Lazy Apes(.com) domain, with
  intention to venture on the similar titled venture.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have started designing
  the logo which should convey , young, hip, cool, on the fly, student-like, computer
  and design aware...\r\n\r\nI am happy with the monkey but not sure about the font.\r\n\r\ncan
  i get a witness?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_sketch3_6575.jpg]"

    those descriptors. I'd try and come up with some more options."

    that you feel would be in the same ballpark as your endeavor. Post a few links
    and we can then help steer some ideas into a more specific direction for you.\r\n\r\nWithout
    knowing much more about the specific operation, I'd like to see something with
    maybe a bit more humour. What would a lazy ape use? Bananas in a can? Pillows?
    Sit in a chair with a TV?"
