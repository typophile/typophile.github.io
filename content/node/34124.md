  body: "It looks a little like some Identikal fonts, like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/stak/\">Stak</a>,
    that may have been modified. However, I think it's more likely that it is a custom
    font, or even a freebie techno design. I always hunt through Dafont using a text
    sample that is from your 'mystery font'. I often find these styles that way, since
    Techno designs seem to be a favorite of amateur font designers.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: Although I follow your reasoning, I think this font looks a tad too sophisticated
    for it to be freeware. But as I haven't got a clue what it is, my opinion is of
    little value.

  body: "You could be right Yves, but I'm playing the odds. If it's custom, we won't
    find it anywhere. I just searched MyFonts' 419 Techno fonts (no joy), and I am
    starting on the Dafonts 'Techno' category. I'll report back with my results. The
    other place that might bear fruit is Veer, but I have some trouble with browser
    obsolescence there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thank's for your interest. Both of you.\r\nbowfinpw, I was also going to
    search on the 3 Indie Font books, but as you said that already did that search,
    I'm gonna search elswere.\r\nMy first tough was that this might be a freebie font,
    but also think that it have a very good design to be a freeware font.\r\nIt's
    a gorgeous techno design, don't you agree?"

  body: "I'm probably the wrong person to ask, since it is well known around here
    that I am not a fan of 'techno' (I think they are too similar too often, and have
    become a clich\xE9 for 'modern = hi-tech'). However, this one IS different, and
    reminds me more of Bauhaus-styles, which I think were the origin of simpler typography
    as a philosophical approach, not as a branding tool, and in that way were truly
    different and modern. The fact that we still see them so often today in that context,
    over 70 years later, means they apparently convinced us to see it that way too.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as Dafont goes, I searched the Techno Sci-Fi and Techno Various categories
    and didn't find this one (as Yves predicted). Has someone searched Veer for Techno
    styles? A lot of their foundries may already have been partially covered by the
    Indie Books, so the case that this might be a custom design is getting much stronger.\r\n\r\nDid
    you write to them to ask about the font? Sometimes you can get an answer, so it's
    worth a try.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
