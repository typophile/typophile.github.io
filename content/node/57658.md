  body: "There was a Letraset type called [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide05.html|Stack]]
    that was along these lines, but remember you are looking at type from over 170
    years ago. I think someone has been working on digitizing Stack, but I don't know
    if that project is complete.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    agree it has similarities with Stack but in my opinion it's far superior.\r\nI
    hope someone will see the need for digitizing this one too.\r\n"

    a font with very limited use, but it is eye-catching, beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\n-
