body: 'This is not my first attempt at a serious sans design, but it is my most recent.
  It is in the very early stages of development, only the lowercase is drawn. It&#39;s
  a very sterile design with one goal in mind, legibility. It has sacrificed unique
  features to be extremely usable in a variety of typographic situations. Does anyone
  have comments? <BR> <BR><!--attachment: furtive_test-25986.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*12.5*furtive*furtive_test%2epdf

  body: I&#39;m only a beginner, but I personally think it&#39;s terrific. Very readable.
    My only thoughts at the moment are that for some reason, the opening at the top
    of the x gives me the illusion of being larger than the bottom. It would probably
    help the x to look a little more solidly &#34;grounded&#34; to open the bottom
    just a tad. Also, personally I think the lip &#40;right word? bottom bit&#41;
    of the e could come just a teensy bit further out. I didn&#39;t notice this in
    the running text, but in the display &#34;furtive&#34; the e seems to be slightly
    too far right.

  body: Heh, I did the same thing with my first posts. This forum software isn&#39;t
    very noob friendly. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>I see what you are saying with the &#34;x&#34;,
    it is currently mechanically even, maybe some optical correction is in order.
    I am bothered with the &#34;e&#34; also and the &#34;a&#34; and a few others.
    I need to work out a few bugs I&#39;m seeing with those little guys. <BR> <BR>-Matt

    But what a great learning opportunity. Just looking at the hamburger sample above
    I see three things you can learn from Frutiger&#39;s genius. <BR> <BR>1. The first
    is the terminals on the a, e and g. Frutiger brings the weight farther into the
    curve which makes for a more natural modulation. <BR> <BR>2. The bowl of the g
    rests above the baseline. Yours looks raised maybe a hair, but still low &#40;ie.
    very close to the b&#41;. <BR> <BR>3. Check out the stem endings in the following
    glyphs: a, m, b, u, r, and g. Notice how Frutiger shaves his stems a bit to open
    the join, but also to appear optically the same width as the other side of the
    join. By comparison, yours are looking hefty. <BR> <BR>The resolution is too low
    to tell, but check to see if the counters on your b and g eat in to the stem &#40;rather
    than run tangent, actually overshooting the stem&#41;. <BR> <BR>That said, yours
    is very well crafted. Nicely done. <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: 'Good eye, Randy! Here is today&#39;s result after some tweaking.  <BR> <BR>First,
    the bowls now intersect the verticals instead of blending into them. The top and
    bottom of the bowls also hit the stroke lower/higher to make more room for ink
    collection at small sizes. <BR> <BR>Second, I canted the top of all of the ascenders
    and tops of the vertical strokes. <BR> <BR>Third, the &#34;i&#34; and &#34;j&#34;
    now have round dots. <BR> <BR>The letters most changed were the  &#34;a&#34; and
    &#34;b&#34; and &#34;q&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Now the question, should I keep going and
    try to sell this thing or start over? <BR> <BR><!--attachment: furtive_test_02_09-26119.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*12.9*test*furtive_test_02_09%2epdf

  body: True, Claudio. I&#39;ve been sketching a lot lately and need to sit down and
    take the time to make the characters &#34;mine&#34;. In general, I just use my
    sketches as a quick starting point. I think what I need to do is spend more time
    in that phase.
