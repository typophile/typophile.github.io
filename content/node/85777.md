  it's not too much trouble, I'd like some feedback on the below logotype (currently
  in development). The 'e' specifically is bothersome.\r\nIt has been some time since
  I worked on an identity from scratch without using existing typefaces and to be
  honest, I'm a little rusty.\r\n\r\nIt will be accompanied by a simple icon (concept
  also under development) that reflects the choice of name for this project. I'll
  bring that to the fore later in the process.\r\n\r\nOwnership isn't an issue as
  it's completion will mark the long awaited launch of my own creative studio. After
  reading the 'some things to keep in mind...' thread I have no problem with openly
  discussing this within the forum.\r\n\r\nHere goes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Initial render
  of the proposed logotype.</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lode_logotype_dev1_typophile_6664.png]\r\n\r\n<strong>Geometric
  breakdown of proposed logotype.</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lode_logotype_dev2_typophile_6603.png]\r\n\r\nJames"
