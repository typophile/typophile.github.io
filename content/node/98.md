  body: Nice... <BR> <BR>You see, this is the problem with digital typography. The
    average user try setting some text in a 12 point, alised TrueType font and say
    they don&#39;t like it and that everything looks like Times anyway...  <BR> <BR>The
    truth is, even some graphic designers do this! They don&#39;t know they have to
    print it out in order to really discern the differences and to appreciate them.
