  I am no expert so they may be the same...\r\n\r\nIf not, could anybody recommend
  any similar typefaces? What I like about the two examples is the letter 'R' and
  it's open counter, and the shape of the letter 'S' in the first example.\r\n\r\nMany
  Thanks\r\n\r\nSimon[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marchworks_5218.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/0111_5162.png]"
