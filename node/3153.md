    <BR> <BR>Depending on the context and source, it may be a bit like the way Jonathan
    Barnbrook stirs the socio-political pot with his naming and background concepts.
    No direct or indirect associations or comparisons are meant to be applied by the
    following statement, but quite frankly, font names like <i>Infidel</i>, <i>Nixonscript</i>
    and <i>Shock &amp; Awe</i> might cause the same amount of gooseflesh as the phrase
    <i>Meinkampf</i> in some circles.'

    and abstracted them for a song, which he called &#39;Strawberry Fields Forever&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s an excerpt from an interview Lennon gave to Rolling Stone
    in 1968: <BR> <BR>Q: &#34;What is Strawberry Fields?&#34; <BR> <BR>JOHN: &#34;It&#39;s
    a name, it&#39;s a nice name. When I was writing &#39;In My Life,&#39; I was trying
    &#39;Penny Lane&#39; at that time. We were trying to write about Liverpool, and
    I just listed all the nice-sounding names, just arbitrarily. Strawberry Fields
    was a place near us that happened to be a Salvation Army home. But Strawberry
    Fields-- I mean, I have visions of Strawberry Fields. And there was Penny Lane,
    and the Cast Iron Shore, which I&#39;ve just got in some song now, and they were
    just good names-- just groovy names. Just good sounding. Because Strawberry Fields
    is anywhere you want to go.&#34;'

    or inspired by Lennon in any of our marketing materials. The product description
    on the web site that mentions Lennon is a required bit of background information
    from the designer. We certainly could have emblazoned the cover or inside spreads
    of our catalogue with superfluous celebrity stroking, but we didn&#39;t. That
    was my original point.'

  body: Andrew, Lennon may be considered hypocritical, a millionaire advocating a
    world without money. But he supported many progressive social causes. The &#34;War
    is Over&#34; ad campaign he and Yoko did was brilliant. Part of the strength of
    his songs was their recognition of his imperfection, he was a jealous guy and
    not afraid to admit it. <BR> <BR>The text in the image file at the top of this
    thread was taken from an army recruitment ad &#40;complete with missing apostrophe&#41;.
    Lennon may have been rich, but he never went to war or started one. I wanted to
    see how it would look. <BR> <BR>And it seems that typographic culture completely
    overwrites any graphological status &#40;the personality or politics of the writer&#41;
    that may reside in handwriting. In other words, even if you know Lennon&#39;s
    politics, you just see &#34;natural&#34; sloppy handwriting, in a sloppy font.
    And the context in which the type works, ie the layout and the images it works
    with, creates far more meaning than can ever be inferred from the script. <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s like we&#39;ve spent many centuries investing subtle differences
    in typeface with particular meanings &#40;type as formalized writing?&#41;, but
    perhaps now what we&#39;re trying to do is figure out something similar for un-formalized
    scripts -- that may be one reason why they&#39;re so popular as fonts.
