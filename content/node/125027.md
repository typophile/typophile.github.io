  Pan</cite> as found at \u2039https://books.google.com/books?id=J-wQAAAAYAAJ\u203A,
  which has been a fun exercise in LilyPond, but I\u2019m curious about the font used
  on the title page and as song titles though the book. (Apparently I\u2019m \u201Cnot
  authorized\u201D to attach a sample image. \u2639) The usual type ID sites don\u2019t
  recognize this, which makes me wonder whether it has ever been digitized. Does this
  look familiar to anyone here?\r\n\r\nEdit: I\u2019ve succeeded in uploading a picture
  to \u2039http://www.typophile.com/statuses/2119\u203A.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: Looks like
  attachment is now permitted to me; yay!"

    not a great match for |PETER PAN|:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/webster/\r\n\r\nThe
    original metal typeface may not have survived into the digital age...."

      if I want a match."

    Senegambian Patrol (George Rosey)</a>, also published by Jos. W. Stern & Co.\r\n\r\n(To
    make my life complicated, in the two versions of the score I have, <em>three</em>
    publishers are listed: Jos. W. Stern & Co., New York and Price & Reynolds, London
    in one edition; in the other edition, W. Paxton & Co. Ltd., London. Who actually
    did the typesetting? I have no idea.)"
