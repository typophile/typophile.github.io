  some similarities with Baskerville. Different versions of Baskerville would be good
  as well, but I'm more interested in fonts that have their own character and personality,
  as subtle as that may be, but are definitely inspired or derived from Baskerville's
  shape and proportion.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=109|Mrs Eaves]]
  is a good one as it is consciously adapting aspects of Baskerville, are there any
  more that go through this process?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nJordan\r\n\r\n"

    does not necessarily produce similarity, as Jordan notes, and that is what particularly
    interests him.\r\n\r\nJB's dramatic innovations (smoother paper, blacker ink,
    type of greater contrast) were taken a step further by the Moderns -- this was
    recognized at the time and subsequently.\r\n\r\nHowever, although I have frequently
    seen it written that Bodoni admired Baskerville, I wonder if there is an actual
    quote from him to this effect, or whether it is an inference by historians to
    justify the \"transitional\" theory, and the narrative line of causality that
    is conventional wisdom. Even if he had purchased works printed with Baskerville's
    types, does that mean they inspired him to adopt similar tropes, or was he merely
    studying the competition, with the goal of emulating its success?\r\n\r\nAfter
    all, I have acquired a lot of type specimens, many of fonts that, if I consider
    them at all,  \"inspire\" me to avoid anything remotely similar.\r\n"

  body: "<em>According to Lawson, Bodoni\u2019s trip to England was a trip to Birmingham
    to meet Baskerville.</em> \r\n\r\nIf Lawson had any reason to write that he did
    not give it. Updike said that after the suicide of Ruggeri, his particular friend
    and patron, and director of the foreign-language printing office of the Propaganda
    Fide (not the Vatican), \u2018Bodoni, unable to endure further employment at Rome,
    left the Press with the idea of seeking his fortune in England.\u2019 As not uncommonly
    happens in Updike\u2019s text, that remark is acute though lacking a source. Bodoni\u2019s
    biographer De Lama said that when he had already spent eight years in Rome and
    was aware of his own capabilities (he had already cut some types) Bodoni was becoming
    interested in seeing countries \u2018beyond the alps\u2019. There were some enthusiasts
    in Rome (De Lama calls them <em>virtuosi</em>) who told him how generous the English
    were, and persuaded him at short notice to come with them. There is no mention
    of Baskerville or Birmingham. We know that, having stopped off in his native Piemonte,
    Bodoni was traced by the new librarian in Parma, Paciaudi, who had known him in
    Rome, and signed up for the new printing office that had been planned there for
    some years by the prime minister, Guillaume Du Tillot. He arrived in 1768.\r\n\r\nBodoni
    wrote in the preface to the little specimen book he made in Parma in 1771 that
    when he was in Rome in the 1760s people were admiring Baskerville\u2019s types
    and praising them, but that he thought it would be more \u2018useful\u2019 to
    follow those of Fournier which had better proportions. Useful because he really
    thought so or because French culture was supreme in Parma? He wisely does not
    explain. That is his only published reference to Baskerville\u2019s types. Baskerville\u2019s
    name does appear in the posthumously published <em>Manuale tipografico</em> of
    1818 but only in a couple of very general references.\r\n\r\nMany of the types
    in the specimen of 1771 are Fournier\u2019s, which Du Tillot had already imported.
    Some of the others are imitations of Fournier\u2019s flowers and decorated letters,
    not all of them very good. There is also a single unnumbered leaf of Greek which
    is a straight copy of the type that Baskerville made for the University Press
    at Oxford. It is a pretty, small octavo specimen, very rare, with a decorative
    title page imitated directly from the second volume (the one with the specimen)
    of Fournier\u2019s <em>Manuel typographique.</em> The title is <em>Fregi e majuscole
    incise e fuse da Giambattista Bodoni, direttore della Stamperia Reale</em>, \u2018ornaments
    and capitals cut and cast by Giambattista Bodoni, director of the royal printing-office\u2019.
    (In 1982 the Houghton Library in Cambridge MA issued a facsimile made from one
    of their own copies, including its printed wrappers. It is among their publications
    currently listed for sale. The price is six dollars.)\r\n\r\nAmong the books associated
    with Bodoni at the Palatina Library in Parma is a rather battered copy of Fournier\u2019s
    <em>Manuel typographique</em>, with some smoke proofs of punches in a style resembling
    Fournier\u2019s on some of the pages. Pasted inside the front cover are quite
    a lot of fragments cut from Baskerville\u2019s specimen sheet of about 1762. Marks
    on some of the fragments suggest that an attempt has been made to get copies from
    some of the letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Baskerville DP

  body: "It is at least conventional wisdom, as stated in Updike, that Baskerville
    opened the door through which Bodoni rushed. Thus, he stated that while Baskerville
    was a good typeface in itself, it was \"mischevious\" in its effects.\r\n\r\nEssentially,
    Baskerville designed a typeface that looked more impressive than Caslon, but one
    which required new high-quality printing techniques to look reasonable. Thus,
    he was unable to make an economic success of his printing business, and was roundly
    disliked by other printers.\r\n\r\nBodoni and Didot then took the characteristics
    of letterforms pioneered by Baskerville to an extreme. Eventually, as printing
    technology caught up, and with a particular boost from the French Romain du Roi,
    another inspiration for Bodoni, (The Romain du Roi, though, was released in the
    year Caslon was born, which seems to complicate the usual story as I've understood
    it.)\r\n\r\nThus, changes in fashion, each step seeming reasonable at the time,
    led to Caslon being replaced by a host of Scotch Roman faces, inspired by Bodoni,
    many of which now look to the eyes of many people today as unattractive."
