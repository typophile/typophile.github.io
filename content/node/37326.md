  body: "I like that thread a lot. It sums up an overly used typeface really nicely.
    It's a good example of a typeface with a lot of heritage that shouldn't be thrown
    around. It takes a delicate hand (restraint!) to use.\r\n\r\nAnybody know who
    did the Copperplate refresh for Rembrandt? http://littlefury.com/_1b.html"

  body: "Pasting my comment from Speak Up:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"...Copperplate was
    designed for letterpress (as all the type of it's time was, obviously). But, it
    was specifically designed to feel like a sans serif, yet hold it's crispness at
    small sizes. This is the reason there was no lowercase... The metal simply would
    not have held the small shapes. This explains it's very wide with very fine serifs.\r\n\r\n\"It
    does what it was designed to do very well. It was never intended to be a display
    face. (Same with Bank Gothic and Bell Gothic!) Fred Goudy must roll over in his
    pantheonic grave when Copperplate ships on hard drives everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"With
    this context I actually think it's a bit of genius. Makes me want to take a second
    look at the Goudy stuff I usually pass over.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n"

  body: I don't really like it either. (Nor do I like Speak Up, it looks good, but
    I can never figure out where I am on that site. It needs breadcrumbs or something
    like that.)

  body: "My problem with SpeakUp is more than just navigational. Yes, I highly enjoy
    their brutal critiques of everything design, but sometimes they are rife with
    inconsiderate anarchism and lack of appreciation for the past (which are not present
    in this article, by the way.)\r\n\r\nHowever, they are a good reading if the client
    just rejected your third comp and you want to get back at the world in a witty,
    intelligent manner ;-)"

    I just cannot get with), but I think they did good with this one.  Always nice
