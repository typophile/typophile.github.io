  to the output panel,it seems that i didn\xB4t name the opentype classes right, because
  my classes are not recognized as classes but as missing glyphs.\r\n(have a look
  at the screenshots i uploaded)\r\n\r\ndoes anybody know how i have to name the classes
  to make them be recognized as what they are?\r\n\r\nthank you!\r\n"
