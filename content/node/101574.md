  We're using Cologne 80 and MilanSixty weights in allcaps.\r\n\r\nIt's for print,
  specifically a 30 pg booklet for starters. Type will be larger than a typical book.\r\n\r\nI'm
  just starting to look at possible combinations and would really appreciate any input.\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am working on a typographic portrait project for a typography
    class and am using Chalet Comprim\xE9 as my chosen subject. For the preliminary
    specimens and design brief, I've had some good results pairing Comprim\xE9 with
    Chalet or Chalet Book (the two companions from House Industries). Chalet Book
    seems to be more versatile due to the small caps, small cap figures and OpenType
    features. It might be way too geometric to pair with Comprim\xE9 (for your taste,
    and point size that you are going for, in text). But if you are using headers
    in MilanSixty all caps, they might play well together. I've also tried Folio with
    limited experimentation as a companion text face. \r\n\r\nGood luck~ "
