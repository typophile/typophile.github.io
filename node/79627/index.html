  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am a student, currently in the process of purchasing my first font pack. After doing some research on this forum I came across two particular options that seems to fit what I need</p>
<p>Adobe FontFolio Education Essentials,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>the 1000 fonts from bitstream that are stored with CorelDraw Graphic Suite X5</p>
<p>now my question is which would be better for someone in my position?</p>
<p>Should I stick with the Adobe collection because of the versatility of it&rsquo;s collection, or get the CorelDraw fonts because of the vast immensity in the scale of what it offers? Which of the two would offer me a better ground as far as building up my skills, and collection from?</p>
<p>Excuse this post if it&rsquo;s in the wrong section, and if this has been posted before feel free to close it and redirect me towards the thread.</p>
<p>Here are links to the mentioned packs</p>
<p>CorelDraw list

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am also a student, and I bought the adobe package and am happy with it. A lot of the fonts are &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; fonts with lots of opentype features, extended glyph sets, large families with different weights, optical sizes&hellip;</p>
<p>The PDF adobe provides is very long and hard to read - they used to have another PDF on this page: <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/03/ffee.html">http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/03/ffee.html</a></p>
<p>but the link is dead now. I have the one-page PDF with a summary of the families that that page used to link to - how can I attach a PDF?.</p>
<p>Some of the non-Adobe-created families only have a few fonts, so they&rsquo;re kind of a teaser (DIN, Futura, Baskerville, Officina, etc.), but it&rsquo;s still great to have a legal copy of at least some of the weights of those great families.</p>
<p>There is a bunch of overlap with the fonts that come with Creative Suite, but I found it worth the price to get the additional fonts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/education/products/typeclassics.html">http://www.adobe.com/education/products/typeclassics.html</a> - slightly cheaper but not as good.</p>
<p>I keep meaning to do a chart showing the differences between the CS5, the FFEE, and the TypeClassics font lists. That would be useful&hellip;</p>

<p>MyFonts currently lists [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Afree/fonts/|about 600 free fonts]]. Much crap, ok, but if you look into it you’ll find some very decent offerings adding to your basic starter set: e.g. Museo, Secca or Novel. In any case, check with the glyph contents of freefonts, it tends to be limited.</p>
<p>And, of course, you’re welcome to give [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=194|Andron]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lapidaria/medior-light/|Lapidaria]] a try as well  ;-)</p>

But typography is a practical discipline, and your education will be limited and limiting if you develop work habits in such a straight groove.</p>
<p>I wrote about this issue <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/PerfcSet.pdf">here</a>; that was ten years ago (before OpenType), so the examples are out of date—but I stick by the theory and principle.</p>

<p>Yeah, if you can only get one, get the Adobe package. But if you can afford both, get them both.</p>
<p>That being said, the Adobe package by itself will give you plenty to work with and explore for a while.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you all for the responses.</p>
<p>Mugford - Very helpful, yeah the overlap isn&rsquo;t necessarily that much and it seems like it still is a quality package at a ridiculous price, so I think I will be purchasing the education essentials to get started off. Thanks for taking the time to compile the links and the actual details of the adobe collection super helpful.</p>
<p>Andreas - Thanks for the suggestion, your right it is a bit novel to think that I need that many faces, I would spend hours looking at all the various fonts packages with the corel product, that I probably wouldn&rsquo;t get anything done design wise as I ogle through the list haha. Very nice suggestions though. Thank you.</p>
<p>Nick - Thanks for that link, that really put something in perspective for myself in regards to how I view the practice of typography, it was critically informative. Thank you.</p>
<p>Thomas - Your right, although I would need much restraint, purchasing the corel pack doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean I have to let myself drown in a sea of fonts, well taken advice. Thank you.</p>
<p>Aluminum - Yeah that was the page which actually led me to post this question as I wanted to deepen my knowledge of whats effective and not, thanks, that page is an invaluable source.</p>
<p>I guess one lesson that I came across is that even though this is a big start for myself, it is only a small step in my life long journey of type education it appears.</p>
