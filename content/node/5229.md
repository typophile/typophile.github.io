  <BR> <BR>Anybody seen or used this? Seems rather pointless if you&#39;ve already
  got FontLab, FOG, etc. but might be useful for some people.

  body: 'I have seen it and used it because I like goofing off. A friend pointed me
    to it a couple of weeks ago. I downloaded it onto my Mac &#40;Mac OS X 10.3.x&#41;
    and ran it, no problems. <BR> <BR>Okay, if you are used to your present vector
    drawing tools,  and say you like the pen tool a lot &#40;and you do, right?&#41;,
    the way this thing draws WILL MAKE YOUR HEAD CAVE IN. <BR> <BR>After you recover,
    if you figure out the secret magic trick, drawing curves kind of makes sense.
    But then you&#39;ll be recovering from a caved-in cranium. <BR> <BR>The really
    cool thing is &#34;Glyphs are stored in XML based file to aid collaboration using
    existing tools such as CVS.&#34; Which could be neat. <BR> <BR>Other stuff: Mac
    users may care that the menus appear in the window not the menu bar. Double-click
    the doubletype.jar file in the /bin folder. <BR> <BR>I look forward to Mr. Blokland&#39;s
    review. &#40;and Typographica&#41;. <BR> <BR>Jon'

    stage, and there&#39;s spacious room for improvement. <BR> <BR>It&#39;d be greatly
    appreciated if you can let me know what&#39;s wrong, missing, or some detail you
    don&#39;t like. It&#39;s an opensource project, so community&#39;s support is
    essential. <BR> <BR>e.e
