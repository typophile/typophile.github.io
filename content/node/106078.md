  body: "Oh, I just love that old analogue Electro-Harmonix gear, it used to be the
    main feature of my pedal board (before I went digital) - Switchblade channel selector,
    Small Stone Phaser, Deluxe Electric Mistress Flanger, Deluxe Memory Man Delay,
    Big Muff Pi Fuzz Box + Cryin' Tone Wha Pedal - Oh what joy!\r\n\r\nAnyhow - I
    digress - The Electric Mistress font. Well as I recall, EHX used to have a habit
    of taking a commercially available typeface and then modifying it for their own
    purpose. So, as Ryuk suggested above, you are gonna need to do some serious editing
    but the DeCoro font may be a good place to start. Slice by adding a dividing line
    through the text. You could modify the \"r\" by using the top part of the letter
    \"s\". You will have to replace the \"t\" - flip the top of the \"e\" and take
    the stroke from the \"l\". You get the general idea.\r\nFind it here:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/john-moore/decoro/\r\n\r\nShould
    you want to add the \"electro-harmonix\" text you will need the font Sidhe Noble:\r\nhttp://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/Sidhe_Noble.htm\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps - enjoy!\r\n\r\nDoghouse Studio\r\n"

    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/386744|here]] but part of
    some very loosely similars from these links, nothing really interesting. \r\n3
    solutions:\r\n- you need an exact match: make it yourself using some vector editing
    software like Adobe Illustrator, CorelDraw or [[http://inkscape.org|Inkscape]]
    (free); not so hard to reproduce as it's only made with basic geometric shapes;
    you'd need only one square and one circle, simply duplicating, overlapping and
    cutting.\r\n- perfect client for [[http://fontstruct.com|Fontstruct]]: same work
    as previous but you could build, directly and freely, a keyable font \r\n- start
    from any \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/blippo|Blippo]]\" font and rework it:\r\n
    \ . commercial: [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/blippo|Blippo]]\r\n  . free: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/knuckle-down|Knuckle
    Down]], [[http://paulw.deviantart.com/art/Consume-of-Die-Typeface-160925786|Consume
    of Die]], [[http://www.dafont.com/hff-modern-strand.font|Modern Strand HFF]] (have
    also a look to these 2 sections at DaFont to find more possibilities: [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=115|Fancy

      in the font I suggested.

    most probably an illegal copy of Skjald. "
