  body: "A <a href=\"http://inawesalon.com.au/\">hair salon in Adelaide</a> is a professional
    place and you should feel like you have stepped into a place of luxury and relaxation.
    Professionals take pride in their work and it should reflect on their surroundings.
    The environment should be comfortable and inviting. The stylists should demonstrate
    upbeat, positive attitudes about their workplace.\r\n"

  body: Looks to me like it started out as a font but has been worked on alot - the
    A being a combine of upper and lower case. If i had to duplicate I would trace
    in Illustrator and clean up from that.
