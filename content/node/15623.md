    serifs. I'm guessing this was a font with very thin horizontal strokes, squooshed
    to make it appear taller.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Lex, I think you're right. I tried it with a normal serif font at 300% the
    normal height, and got something very similar in shape. I wanted to try it with
    Perpetua, but it wasn't handy. (I think you need a typeface with a P whose bowl
    droops a bit after leaving the stem.)\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to play such games,
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/peplum/peplum/testdrive.html?s=D+E+P+T&p=72\"
    target=\"new\">Peplum</a> is similar 'off the shelf'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
