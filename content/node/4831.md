  try. A design incubator is an entreprise that gives favorable enviroment for a designer

  a simbol of someone protecting a smaller one, I guess you guys can see it. Duplicate,

  body: Hola Julio <BR> <BR>i agree with Hrant that officina don&#39;t work with your
    logo. They rather fight against. Why don&#39;t you design some more leters in
    the way of your logo-letters? I am sure you are having in your mind to go on with
    your letterforms and create a complete font anyway. <BR> <BR>When i saw the nice
    symbol you created i thought that by condensing the upper dot a little you could
    have an compact exclamation mark which is suitable to the case &#40;ideas in a
    protective nest&#41;. <BR>But tell me about the company. A long time ago I watched
    on tv a documentary about Barcelona and there was a German guy who created such
    a company. Is it the same you are working for? I am curious. It is funny because
    i was impressed by the idea and it&#39;s the only thing i remember from the documentary.
    It will be a nice coincidence to be the same company. <BR> <BR>Buenos dias, christos

  body: I agree with Christos. do the rest of the letters. They are very nice. If
    you do not have the time and/or budget try something else. Officina is OK in my
    opinion, but you can do better. <BR>In the future, working in layers with a text
    font / weight you intend to use underneath new letters can make it easier to get
    matching fonts. I am not suggesting de-construction of existing paths but general
    characteristics <BR> <BR>btw. your type design remind me of Darren Scott&#39;s
    Hydrate, although yours is more legible. Here is a link to Darren Scott&#39;s

    Indea name... kind of the &#34;Swoosh&#34; with the Nike brand. Yeah, connect
    them, but don&#39;t feel compelled to make them into a single logo.

    Hrant &#40;although it may not hurt to try it&#41;--the &#39;e&#39; seems like
    it&#39;s just about the fall to the left. Maybe it&#39;s just me... <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    the sharper corner could be placed elsewhere on the &#39;e&#39;? Like the bottom
    left curve or the top right curve? <BR> <BR>Does the &#39;n&#39; need to be a
    tad heavier? You should carry this through when you get a chance and make a complete
    font from this. I&#39;m havin&#39; fun just thinkin&#39; about it... <BR> <BR>Well,
    I don&#39;t want to be a nit-picker--it&#39;s working out nicely so far. <BR>

  body: Julio, <BR> <BR>I hate to barge in at this late hour, but this logo has great
    potential and I see some issues. The main problem is in the balance of the letters.
    Right now the i is stable, the n is stable &#40;the curves look wobbly but it&#39;s
    hard to tell&#41;, the d is falling to the left, the e is falling to the left
    the a is relatively stable. <BR> <BR>In my opinion it doesn&#39;t have to do with
    the location of the corners, but rather an instability in your master glyph shape
    from which all the others are derived. If you balance that shape, then your letters
    will be balanced. The following illustration highlights what I&#39;m talking about.

  body: Regarding the marque/icon itself, I don&#39;t think you should restrict yourself
    to one position or spot colour. The grayscale quad logo as well as the conjoined
    quad work nicely, as do the varying positions of the single in the green spot.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;d find text that works well &#40;as you&#39;re well on your way to doing&#41;
    and keep an element of fluidity about the specifics of that marque.
