body: "Hello everyone\r\nI have been asked to help out a fellow designer who has a
  hand drawn font that needs to be constructed in fontographer.\r\nI have built some
  fonts with it in the past, but this particular one is a joined up face. \r\nHas
  anyone done this before? and if so, have you any advice when building? I could just
  bungle my way though but its for quite a big client and I don't want to mess it
  up for her.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nChris"

  body: "There is a trick to making joined fonts but it really isn't too hard. It
    just takes a little planning up front. Le's see if I can describe it without diagrams...\r\n\r\nStart
    with drawing one letter, it doesn't really matter which one too much, so long
    as it has the trailing joining stroke. In a Latin cursive font, this will end
    at the same level for all but the b, o, v, and w, and those will need special
    attention later.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your letter, set your right sidebearing
    inside the end of the joining stroke (a negative value. Now copy and paste the
    letter to the guide layer and position it so the joining stroke protrudes through
    the left sidebearing by the same amount. Set horizontal guides at the level the
    stroke penetrates and at its lowest and highest points.\r\n\r\nNow, adjust the
    left sidebearing of the letter so the overlap with the joining stroke on the guide
    layer is enough for a smooth transition.\r\n\r\nThis should give you enough to
    go on for most of the rest of the font."
