body: "Hello typophiles, right now I'm working on a website and need to find the typeface
  for my client's logo. Her logo designer gave her a cd containing the font, but somehow
  she lost it. I did have a copy of her business card though. I've been looking and
  looking. I tried Font Shop's Font Navigator, and What the Font, and Identifont,
  and some browsing through similar typefaces, but I couldn't find it. And although
  it's possible, I don't think that the font has been modified, because I think I've
  seen it before in a magazine adverisement for a different company once. I'd really
  appreciate the help. \r\n\r\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/7614/img120927lj.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnthony"

  body: Wow! Thank you. When I use What the Font it gave me a bunch of grungy fonts.
    I must have done it wrong somehow. That's exactly it though! Thank you very much
    :-)
