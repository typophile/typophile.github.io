body: Okay, this matching this one is driving me crazy, but it's got to be some basic
  font that I'm missing, or possibly a hinted version of something I am checking.

  body: Yeah, that was my thought. Must be some Windows pixel hinting that I can't
    match, because the g and a are stretched vertically relative to what I have.

  body: Probably so. I notice even just in Photoshop that cycling through the antialiasing
    options can pretty dramatically change the letter shapes and spacing at these
    sizes.
