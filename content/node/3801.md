body: Hello <BR>I am a student and we are using fontagrapher to create our font.  One
  other student and I are having problems with kerning.  We kern our pairs.  When
  we go to gernerate our fonts, the kerninng does not appear.  It is like we kerned
  nothing. I have some kerning pairs, I don&#39;t think that it is too many.  Heather
  the other girl has alot of kerning pairs.  Our teacher and us are at a loss what
  to do next.  Any ideas?   <BR> <BR>Lisa <BR>  <BR>PS Heather also asked me to ask
  if anyone knows why her letters are appearing smaller than what the point size says.
