  please recommend a few fonts with high and low x-heights? Popular or more well known
  fonts would be better, but I am open to ideas. Thanks!"

    to look at x-height is to compare the lowercase with a capital. Extenders can
    always be lengthened. Look at the Trinit\xE9 variants, for example. Or Seria and
    Scala, though the two are a little bit different in other ways. \r\n\r\nHere's
    my take on (serifed) fonts with a high x-heigth: You can't properly kern the r,
    u, w and y with a cap T."

  body: "Of course, there are all those ITC big x-height versions of classics, which
    were designed in the 1970s and 80s. Most contentious was the Garamond. Also ITC
    Cheltenham and ITC Caslon.\r\n\r\nIn the same era, Headliners International (franchised
    typositor type shops) produced big-x versions of just about every previous type,
    which they termed \u201CNeo Mini-Whatever\u201D.\r\n\r\nLes Usherwood (Typsettra)
    produced many large-x designs, eg Flange. Again, same era.\r\n\r\nKoch\u2019s
    Antiqua, aka Eve, very small x.\r\n\r\nAntique Olive, very large x, and small
    extenders.\r\n\r\nAdvertisers Gothic, early 20th century, big x and very short
    descenders.\r\n\r\n"
