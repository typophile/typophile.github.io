  their photos online. So my question is... Does any similar software exist for typefaces?
  Can any program be ran to find the shape of a glyph across the internet? '

    unlikely considering the cost to do such a thing.

  body: "It is possible to design a search engine that looks for the mathematical
    fingerprint of a font. At least with OTF (PostScript or TrueType flavor) this
    could work. There are descriptions of the vectors and mapping available, which
    would increase chances of similarity. It wouldn\u2019t be too costly to program
    such a search engine. The question is more, is it worth the effort? Because it\u2019s
    a niche use case product. It would require you to have the original font to begin
    with, so what would be the actual application for general use?"
