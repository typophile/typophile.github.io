    some work imo. I&#39;d love to see this with extra weight. <BR>maybe at smaller

  body: now, you could just move to fog or fl and refine the characters, like a, g,
    s. <BR> <BR>it looks nice.

  body: '&#62; worth finishing ? <BR> <BR>Definitely. <BR> <BR>UC: the &#34;G&#34;
    needs a serif inside. The &#34;Q&#34; is great. The &#34;Y&#34; needs work. <BR>
    <BR>lc: I don&#39;t like the &#34;a&#34;. Maybe cut the &#34;f&#34; at the top
    of the arc. Move the bottom of the &#34;g&#34; to the right. The &#34;j&#34; needs
    a serif. The &#34;k&#34; is great. Superb &#34;q&#34;. Not sure about the &#34;r&#34;.
    The &#34;y&#34; needs a serif. The &#34;z&#34; is leaning. <BR> <BR>Numerals:
    Have a smaller set[ too]. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s something fundamentally wrong about
    the italics. <BR> <BR>Peculiars: I like the first eszet and the first percent
    &#40;great!&#41; but not the first brackets. <BR> <BR>Make three weights, one
    an Ultra. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: starting to look really nice. <BR> <BR>I like the new solution on the &#34;a&#34;
    but the serif seems heavy &#40;maybe its just the gif&#41;, <BR>also what about
    pulling it a bit to the right so its not hanging so much? <BR> <BR>Like Cristian
    said, the &#34;g&#34; looks out of place. Maybe its because the lower counter
    <BR>looks like it should be the top counter? <BR> <BR>I prefer the 1st &#34;G&#34;
    because its the simplist. <BR>That &#34;Q&#34; is still kickin @

  body: 'UC: I like the 1st &#34;G&#34;. The &#34;L&#34; is too wide for good spacing.
    <BR> <BR>lc: The &#34;a&#34; is worse :-&#40; The &#34;f&#34; is great, but not
    the &#34;j&#34; or &#34;y&#34;. The first &#34;r&#34; is best. <BR> <BR>If that&#39;s
    a florin, it should slant. I&#39;m not sure about the asterisk or the quotes.
    I like the dollar/cent without the serifs. I like the first cedilla, but since
    you have room in the descender space you could have a deeper one too. <BR> <BR>Keep
    it up! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: The image dump is greatly pixillated, so the image lines are a bit variant
    in thickness. The lc a is a problem and will have to have another go at it, the
    florin has not yet had the 12 degree slant put on it, that was on purpose. Will
    give the &#39;y&#39; and &#39;g&#39; half serifs such as in the &#39;f&#39;, that
    should clear up the problem of current serif looking just like a lump on the end
    of a line &#40;or even just flare the bottom of the desend&#41; The lc g may need
    the lower half more rounded to offset problem observed <BR> <BR>The&#39;Italic&#39;
    version that worried you was not intended to be true italic, it was just experimentation
    to get something better than an oblique, something that was visuably different
    than the first. I was going to call it the Anglic version.

  body: I really like this too. <BR> <BR>The only other suggestion that leaps out
    at me <BR>is to try pulling in the overhang of the lc &#34;a&#34; <BR>just a bit.
    As it is, it looks just a bit top-heavy <BR>on the left side. <BR> <BR>As for
    the italics, try more cursive-italic forms, <BR>particularly in the &#34;a&#34;
    and its related characters <BR>&#40;&#34;b&#34;, &#34;d&#39;&#34;, &#34;g&#34;,
    &#34;p&#34;, &#34;q&#34;&#41; and also in the &#34;k&#34;. <BR> <BR>This could
    be a commercial success, <BR>especially with a full range of weights. <BR>I&#39;d
    buy it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: This is a really really great face! <BR> <BR>I like the 2nd &#34;a&#34;...the
    curve seems more fitting in <BR>relation to your other characters. <BR> <BR>The
    lower right serif of the &#34;N&#34; looks awkward.

  body: Graham, your doing a great job. <BR> <BR>That new &#34;a&#34; looks great
    &#40;the 1st one&#41;. <BR>The UC looks good except &#40;imo&#41; for the &#34;S&#34;.
    I know on a grid it is perfect, <BR>but visually the top serif extends a little
    too far. <BR>Also the &#34;W&#34; might benefit from a slightly extended width.
    <BR> <BR>The lc is looking good except for my little problem with the &#34;s&#34;
    ;&#41; <BR>I would go with the 2nd &#34;g&#34; in your alternates. It has a nice
    balance <BR>between both counters. As for the &#34;jy&#34;, I think the originals
    have the <BR>best character, stick with them. <BR> <BR>keep it up and you have
    a winner! <BR> <BR>Bren <BR> <BR>

    and &#39;s&#39; problem is currently fixed and overhang reduced. the &#39;j&#39;
    and &#39;y&#39; will be the two with half serifs on lower. I find the current
    ones too strong. Will look at the uc &#39;S&#39;.  <BR> <BR>This will happen later

    will be a pleasure, as need some rest badly. <BR>
