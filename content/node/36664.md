  body: "Mintyblues ... happy to help with your IDs, but it's not kosher to be asking
    people to send you free fonts. I would break that habit immediately because doing
    otherwise, frankly, is theft. Not implying that was your intent, just stating
    a reality.\r\n\r\nIf you need to find similar fonts for free, go to dafont or
    one of the other free font web sites."

  body: Book 6 is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/shannon/at-shannon-oblique/">Shannon
    Oblique</a>, by Kris Holmes and Janice Prescott. You'd have gotten a lot quicker
    responses if you'd posted this in the Type ID forum.

    can't go around asking for commercial fonts for free on Typophile. As you're new
    here I'll let it slide, but please don't do it again.\r\n\r\nAnd welcome to Typophile
    BTW. I hope you'll enjoy your visits. :^)"
