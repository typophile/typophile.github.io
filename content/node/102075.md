  what this font is: It's used in the World of Greyhawk logo from Advanced Dungeons
  & Dragons. Here are a few examples of the font used on book covers, and the attachment
  is a cleaner sample.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dndclassics.com/images/44/17407.jpg\r\nhttp://www.tsrinfo.net/archive/gh/gh-wars.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: through some googling, i've found reference that you may be looking for a
    font called Greyhawk Uncial. it was created specifically by the designer. without
    a sample to verify against yours i'm just following what seem to be logical steps.

  body: "To my eye the logo you posted seems hand-lettered based on the R, which is
    the only duplicated letter. The font is likely based on the style of the logo
    lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
