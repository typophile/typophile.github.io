body: "The OERT project is offering expert type design review service for US$100+
  as part of its fund raising efforts to publish some great educational resources
  for type designers :) \r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosgaya/oert-open-educational-resources-for-typography\r\n<!--break-->\r\nHere's
  the description:\r\n\r\n\"This project aims to make high quality learning resources
  on typography and type design available to every student in the world.  The resources
  will be completely free and open, like Wikipedia.\r\n\r\n[VIDEO]\r\n\r\nWe are teachers
  of typography at FADU/UBA, the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism from
  University of Buenos Aires. This is a free public university, one of the most important
  universities in Argentina and it has the largest number of students. This year is
  UBAs 190th anniversary.\r\n\r\nSince the Graphic Design degree began here, Typography
  has been considered one of the most important subjects of the curriculum. We belong
  to C\xE1tedra Cosgaya, a teaching team that delivers typography lessons to over
  500 students each year.\r\n\r\nTo deliver the course, we have been developing and
  refining booklets to support our curriculum since 1994. We are seeking funding and
  support to pay for our expert tutors to spend time away from their freelance design
  practice and update these booklets so that they stand on their own, no longer tied
  directly to our teaching programme. \r\n\r\nAfter thoroughly updating  them, we
  will professionally translate the resources from Spanish into English. We will bring
  this knowledge to the web under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license
  so it can be further translated.\r\n\r\nThe booklets are currently organized into
  three sections:\r\n\r\n* Theory\r\n* History\r\n* Practical exercises\r\n\r\nWe
  plan to work on each section under a specific Kickstarter project. This is the first,
  for producing the Theory of Typography. We plan to run two more Kickstarter projects,
  so that we can learn about the Kickstarter model as we go.\r\n\r\nIf you love typography
  and would like more people to understand why typography and type design is important,
  and how to do it well, please support our project!\r\n\r\nPart 1: Theory \r\n\r\n[VIDEO]\r\n\r\nThe
  first part of the project provides a theoretical framework to understand the attributes
  of a font family and introduce the skills involved in typeface design: what \u2018structure,\u2019
  \u2018stroke\u2019 and \u2018counter\u2019 mean in this field, what kerning and
  tracking are all about, how to deal with details and serifs. It also describes how
  fonts can be used appropriately with a repertoire of approaches to typography for
  different sorts of publications, from music CD inserts to books, newspapers and
  magazines.\r\n\r\nOpen Educational Resources for Typography will launch in late
  December 2011. It will be edited, enhanced and improved with the input and assistance
  of anyone who is interested. We hope your collaboration will help us move the world\u2019s
  typography forward!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n(Please note that this project\u2019s
  funds will be paid to the TeX Users Group (office@tug.org), a USA-based 501(c)3
  non-profit organization that is kindly running a \u2018Libre Font Fund.' This enables
  us to receive the funds in Argentina, since Amazon Payments will not usually work
  outside the USA.)\r\n\r\nThanks to Diego Levy for helping us to create the videos
  for this project!\"\r\n\r\nAnd here are the pledges:\r\n\r\nPLEDGE $1 OR MORE\r\nJoin

    I'm confused, as usual.)\r\n\r\nWho, exactly, is the \"we\" who will be reviewing
    the fonts and doing all this stuff? Who are the \"experts\"?\r\nIt's not exactly
    clear.\r\n\r\nWill the educational stuff be in English? Or Spanish? Will they
    be created in Spanish with an English translation necessary?\r\n(Sorry, I wish
    I spoke Spanish, but I don't.)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nrich\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi, Richard. Thank you for your interest in the project OERT and your questions.\r\n\r\nWe
    (Marcela Romero, Natalia Pano and I, who are promoting this initiative) have convened
    to work with us to young typeface design graduates and digital foundries members.
    Also, we will provide them a form of analysis for the work easier. We will soon
    to announce their names. \r\n\r\nThe project originates from the collection of
    typography booklets distributed (in Spanish) among students of the [[http://www.catedracosgaya.com.ar|chair
    of typography]] which I coordinate at the University of Buenos Aires. These booklets
    contain an introduction to typeface design and design criteria for the use of
    fonts on publishing projects (newspapers, magazines, books).\r\n\r\nThe project
    is intended to edit the content and translate it into English. Since then, may
    be enriched with the contribution of the whole type-community, which you can access
    it as free.\r\n\r\nI wish I write and spoke English, but I can only do so thanks
    to Google Translate ;-)\r\n\r\nI remain at your disposal for any further questions.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
