body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dsc00530_3433.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've been trying
  to ID the font from this signpost for a few days now and have had no success. Answering
  'font quizzes' on the identification websites always brings up Bernhard OT Condensed
  (or whatever it is) but that's not it. It's also not Bernard MT (the MS/Monotype
  knock off). I've been looking at type libraries for hours on end and haven't been
  able to find anything that matches. Using 'Unusual Features' lists for left-angled
  serifs (as in the F and E) has been unsuccessful. The origin of this signpost is
  English and the font's features suggest something around 1900-1910.\r\n\r\nThe way
  I see it the main features are: slab serif, heavy weight, condensed, left-angled
  serifs in F/E, no 'bulbous' serifs (eg serifs at top of letters don't protrude above
  the topmost line of the letters), a straight-backed D (this is the main thing I
  can't find), and a thick bottom part on the L.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can ID this font
  you will be saving me a lot of time redrawing these letters and the rest of the
  alphabet!"
