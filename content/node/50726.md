  here in Los Angeles. I started with a sketch on a piece of paper and then brought
  it into illustrator when I had the basic idea down. Things were progressing well
  and I managed to draw all the characters until I hit the \u201Cs\u201D character.
  I am getting really frustrated and would like your advice. Should I go with a cursive
  or an italic s? And is there a similar looking typeface in the style of my drawing
  which I can source? Also, please feel free to critique the characters I have done.
  Any help will be much appreciated, thank you!\r\n\r\nAce\r\n "

    work for me. I like swoop of the tail and the way it curves under the o but I
    think it needs to start closer to the stem and without the little loop from the
    bowl. The bowl could be made a little bigger too."

  body: "Thanks Justin. The swashed \u201CR\u201D is a play on a spoon and I would
    like to keep and refine it unless it really takes away from the logo. I will work
    on a cursive s but am not looking forward to it. Thanks again.\r\n\r\nAce"
