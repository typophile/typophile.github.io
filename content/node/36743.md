body: "This is my first post, and also the first typeface that I have designed (other
  than several partial alphabets in school). I have completed the upper and lower
  cases, and am working on drawing the numbers. At this point I feel like I could
  use some crit.\r\n\r\nThe letters are all traced using type tool with auto metrics
  and auto kerning applied, and generated as open type ps. I am not sure about some
  of the character widths, and also could use some suggestions as to how the language
  of the upper case should translate to the lower case (for example if an upper case
  letter has an angled terminal, should the lower case as well? As is the case with
  the X). If it is helpful I can set a block of text with the face, and post it later.\r\n\r\nI
  look forward to your critique.\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nandy"

    of the tail of the Q, which looks a bit like it's been artificially compressed."

  body: "There\u2019s a lot of really great stuff going on here, but I would like
    to see a specimen with some words set. The lowercase alphabet seems more grounded
    than the uppercase, which almost seems to be leaning and wobbling, although I
    think some of that is due to the letterspacing.\r\n\r\nTo nitpick: G looks like
    it\u2019s tipping to the left, and I\u2019m confused by the terminals of U angling
    to the reverse of everything else. The same goes for the terminal of the upper
    horizontal in E and F slanting differently."

  body: "I think you need to visit some of the stroke connections, especially in the
    upper case, in spots where there is a lot of mass concentrated: M, N, K, R. W,
    lowercase k. You may need to taper some strokes as these junctions, or have them
    connect differently.\r\n\r\nEchoing James' comment, the upper case isn't as consistent
    as the lower. The A and the M especially don't match the rest.\r\n\r\nI would
    like to see some sample text set in your font."

  body: "thanks for your thoughts. Now that i look at it the G does seem to lean,
    I am going to try extending the terminal slightly. I knew that I had some dark
    spots going on in some of the connections, I will be refining those shortly. As
    for the A and M, I am not sure in what way they stand out. Do you mean because
    they lack the slant?\r\n\r\nI have set a short block of type at 24pt., these are
    the same characters as in the original set. I welcome any additional comments.\r\n\r\nAny
    suggestions on how to approach kerning pairs for the entire font?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nandy"

  body: "Regarding the A and M: although your A has a lower-than-normal bar which
    matches the font, it doesn't have the quirks that make the other letters interesting.
    Perhaps the top should be narrower and angled. Likewise, the M looks too \"normal\"
    when there is opportunity here to give it more personality, such as angles at
    the top of the stems. The V as well could use that treatment, as most of the other
    letters where that can be done have it.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I like the G; if you
    extend the upper terminal, perhaps still keep it a bit to the left of what would
    be \"normal\".\r\n\r\nOn the lowercase e, you might move the lower terminal a
    bit to the left; currently it looks like you're not sure if it should align with
    the top. Make it definitely align, or obviously not. I think the latter would
    suit the font. "

  body: I had that problem at one point but I don't recall what I did to fix it. What
    browser are you using? You could try a different one. Also, on Safari I know that
    the message frame can be expanded/compressed that might do something. I am not
    !00% sure about this but I think you can only add gifs & jpegs and maybe png files
    as inline images in a post. You should be able to add a PDF to your initial post.
    Did this help?
