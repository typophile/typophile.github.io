  or [[http://www.adhd.com.au/Visual_Processing_Disorders.htm|here]], it seems that
  it may be difficult for a dyslexic to separate weights of a typeface, or comfortably
  read certain types? For example, certain [[http://www.dyslexic.com/fonts|fonts]]
  seem to be easier to perceive (e.g. Comic Sans, apparently) than others."

    them (more than the general population) they shouldn''t have to put up with crazy
    fonts, colors and layouts, especially well intentioned quirky choices that "seem"
    as if they might be helpful. '

    about the research results, where any differences found in favor of Dyslexie were

    for dyslexic people, but the tests don't seem to agree. What tests has Boer done?
    Do you reckon it only works for him because he's intimately acquainted with it?
    Or could it imply that perhaps this typeface is suitable for a yet undefined subcategory
    of dyslexia or a different disorder altogether?\r\n\r\nThis sounds silly but I
    just reasoned the other way about Dyslexie's performance \u2014 assuming for a
    moment it works for ALL dyslexic people \u2014 in which case you could ask the
    question if Dyslexie performs much better for people with dyslexia where other
    typefaces don't perform as well and you experience problems with reading but haven't
    been diagnosed as dyslexic, could you not diagnose yourself simply by reading
    text in Dyslexie and see if your reading performance goes up?"

    perception, but the processing, right? I suppose Dyslexie could be an exaggeration
    of aspects which help process visual cues for the designer of the typeface at
    least.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the reason why I came back to this thread is because today
    in the train I had a random thought on dyslexia and I didn't see it as justified
    to start a new thread for this, particularly because I'm assuming we're all getting
    a bit tired of discussing dyslexia. We've said so much about it without achieving
    much progress other than the insight of how current accommodations of type for
    dyslexic people seem to be lacking in terms of practicality and solving the problem.\r\n\r\nDuring
    the train ride I watched the 'Type in a Digital Landscape' lecture by Bruno Maag
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMr4aBdag3Q) and near the end he shows an illustration
    of the brain with different areas defined, and I noticed while the area for processing
    words is on the side near the back, behind it is the visual processing area, and
    in front of and above the word processing area is the area that gives access to
    meaning. Looking at this image, I started speculating about which area would perform
    abnormally/differently in people with dyslexia. I'm assuming it's in this \"Visual
    word form area\" in front of the visual inputs area.\r\n\r\nIf that's indeed the
    area which performs in a deviating way, I wonder what effect language and scripts
    have on a person with dyslexia. Whether there is something going on with visual
    perception, word processing or attributing meaning, in all cases I would be curious
    if and to what extent certain languages and scripts have a different effect on
    the brain, and specifically a dyslexic brain. If there is a visual perception
    problem, would this person perform better with Arabic than with Dutch for example?
    If it's the word processing area to blame in regard to people with dyslexia, does
    the script have an influence? If not, then I doubt a specific typeface can make
    a dramatic difference beyond the attributes that work best for the average person.\r\n\r\nIt
    also occurred to me I've never read about any scientific tests on dyslexia internationally.
    Is dyslexia more common in certain areas? Assuming they're distributed evenly
    and the occurrence of dyslexia is by chance, do people with dyslexia perform better
    in certain countries and if so, does it have to do with the culture, education
    or the language they speak and the writing they utilize?"

  body: "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because dyslexia is \u201Cen vogue\u201D
    lately or if there are systemic changes in how children learn to speak and read,
    but it seems that speech therapists are increasingly in demand  in Italy.\r\nWhat
    I gather from the various threads on the subject on Typophile and elsewhere is
    that we really need better terms to define the issue, because \u201Cdyslexia\u201D
    is a too wide umbrella to be used for what can be addressed from a type design
    point of view.\r\nAlso, I won\u2019t call Italian spelling \u201Csimpler\u201D,
    I would call it \u201Cmore consistent\u201D than English (we don\u2019t need spelling
    bees), and I don\u2019t know if that could have an effect on (some form of) dyslexia.
    German probably has an even more consistent spelling than Italian, so there should
    be even less dyslexics in German-speaking countries? How about French, and all
    those accents?\r\nStill, I\u2019m not sure how a spelling-related dyslexia could
    be addressed by type design.\r\nAnyway, I would note that in Italy we also have
    our \u201Cheavily researched\u201D dyslexia typeface, which is just about a blatant
    rip-off of Officina (http://twitter.com/typographica/status/483926989125218304)."

    is primarily about the sounds of words/letters, not their shapes. Which is probably
    why there haven't been any easy fixes via type design for dyslexia.\r\n\r\nIt
    is also the case that the \"dyslexia\" label is used for any dysfunction in this
    same general area of reading, and this label may be used for multiple independent
    and unrelated (or at least distinct) problems. But again, the available research
    suggests that at least the most common form is related to phonology, not shapes."

  body: "I have a peculiar form of dyslexia called dyscalculia. It involves numeral-number
    relationships instead of letters and words. I have great difficulty remembering
    numerical sequences or being able to tell what order the numerals are in. I have
    no problem with words or passwords that involve numerals interspersed with letters
    and symbols \u2014 it's just that numerical sequences don't fully register as
    corresponding to the numbers they represent.\r\n\r\nFor example, telephone numbers
    aren't really numbers; they're sequences of random numerals, masquerading as numbers.
    Street numbers, on the other hand, are real numbers, so I have less trouble with
    them, but even then, I have difficulty associating, say, 8541 with the actual
    abstract number that those numerals represent.\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with
    the shape of the numerals. I suspect much the same is true with letters and words
    in standard dyslexia."

    might be mistaken about what I said, but I think you misunderstood what I wrote.
    Perhaps I shouldn't have included the word \"visual\", though I believe that was
    the term used in the video. In any case, the area I'm alluding to is distinct
    from the area that controls perception. As I can reason, something goes wrong
    in between the perception area and the area that controls meaning of the words.
    It's in one of the three areas and indeed research suggests it has nothing to
    do with perception, and as far as I know nothing goes wrong in the meaning area
    either."
