  my question. Some topics relate somewhat to the problem, yet none have provided
  the necessary answer.\r\n\r\nSo here we go:\r\nI have been asked to change the auto
  line spacing of an existing font, due to the reason that the program which is going
  to use the font cannot change the line spacing. I have used FontLab and I tried
  to go to \"Font info\" and change in the ascender and descender value, yet in order
  to minimize the distance, I have to ignore the 1000 UPM \"rule\". This sort of works,
  but it also scale the letters, which I would prefer not happened. It also seems
  to affect the hinting of the font, and apparently the generated font only seems
  to work in InDesign and not illustrator. I have read the pdf mentioned in this post
  http://typophile.com/node/59348 but it did not help me.\r\n\r\nSo I turn to you
  guys, and hope that somewhere out there, at least one person has succeded in the
  \"simple\" task of reducing the line spacing in an existing font.\r\n\r\nHope to
  see some contructive replys\r\n\r\nAll the best\r\nBenjamin "

    rather easy task to do in FontLab??"

  body: Well it *may* be easy to do in FontLab but unless you have the *rights* to
    do it, it may also be illegal. Contacting the foundry (the owner that's licensing
    the font to you) will let you find out what's possible *legally*.
