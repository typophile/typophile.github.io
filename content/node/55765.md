  immediately thought of one of my good friend's sites that displays her incredible
  art work.  I really like the simplicity of this site and how it showcases the artwork
  and the artwork only.  I think for mine, I would like something like this, though
  I would probably add a page or a section that had a short biography as well as the
  artwork.  Overall though, I think this website is extremely effective in the display
  of some incredible paintings.\r\n\r\nwww.colormambo.com \r\n"

  body: "The site displays the artist's work well. I agree with you that she should
    provide more information. Visitors to the site may want to learn more, but they
    may not be curious enough to send the artist an email (the only option available
    on the site). \r\nSince you're posting on Typophile, it's worth pointing out that
    typography is the weakest feature of the site. Not counting the titles of the
    paintings, there are only 20 words on this site, and in just 20 words I see type
    that is flush left, centered, indented, all caps, cap & lowercase, normally spaced,
    widely letterspaced, and underscored. \r\nThe artist seems to want to let her
    pictures do the talking, and I'd encourage her to achieve that goal by keeping
    the typography simple and consistent. "

  body: I agree.  I'm hoping to do the same with my site.  In her defense, I know
    that she did not design it (though she did okay it) and money was definitely a
    consideration when paying the designer.  I guess that I just want to achieve the
    same clean-cut feel that she has while showcasing her incredible work.
