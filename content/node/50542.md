  threads I have read so far. \r\n\r\nMy question for the day is in regard to the
  font Argentica. Does anyone know where/if this can be purchased or even have any
  info about this font? I have asked the Google and it didn't net any results so I
  thought I'd put it to the forum..\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/argentica_6570.gif]"

  body: It looks like your sample comes from the Phil's Fonts catalog for photo typositors.
    This was from the pre-digital world and I don't know of a digital version. I think
    your closest option would be found in the many variants of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/house_industries/chalet/">Chalet</a>.

  body: BTW, Hrant is right that the two most mannered characters (a and g) are modeled
    from <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_kabel_std_complete_vp/">Kabel</a>.

    really grabbed my attention, looks like kabel is the way to go."
