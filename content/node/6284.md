  body: The typeface is called Tuscan Ornate  in the Mac McGrew book &#40;p. 344&#41;
    Other names are Bracelet &#40;in Solotype Catalog&#41;, Romantiques no. 5 and
    Ornate No. 5. <BR> <BR>Font Mesa has digitized this as &#39;Main Strike&#39;.

  body: A better digitization, in my opinion, is Dieter Steffmann&#39;s <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/r/romantiques.htm"
    target="_blank"> Romantiques</a>. <BR> <BR>Another is Bracelet New by Douglas
    Day, but I can&#39;t seem to find that any more.

  body: And yet another, <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/jfs/jester.htm"
    target="_blank"> JF Ringmaster</a>. This one is not as well done, <BR>but all
    four digitizations are different.
