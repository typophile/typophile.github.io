body: "BEST REGARDS TO ALL HERE IN THESE TYPOPHILE FORUMS\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI've
  returned for a bit of beginners advice on the world of \r\n\r\nfont creation, or
  in this case modification.\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION\r\n_______________\r\n\r\nI've done
  some reading and research in trying to find the\r\n\r\neasiest method to creating
  or modifying a usable font.\r\n\r\nThis is for a school project and I would simply
  be seeking\r\n\r\nto build on top of some pre-existing work; not at all for\r\n\r\nprofessional
  use or consumption.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to ask was,\r\n\r\nIS THERE A WAY TO OPEN
  STANDARD FONT FORMAT FILES i.e OTF TTF LWFN FFIL\r\n\r\nDIRECTLY INTO FONTLAB, so
  that the file opens with all the metrics and kerning in tact ? ? ?\r\n\r\nI AM IDEALLY
  looking to simply modify a work by\r\n\r\nfilling in BOWLS, changing the TERMINALS;
  I by no means expect to create a classic work.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________\r\n\r\nI
  found this file linked on a previous post .\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.msn.com/FontLab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2675\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nIf
  the above mentioned DIRECT technique is not possible\r\n\r\nwould i then have to
  create a FULL CHARACTER GLYPH SET in ILLUSTRATOR\r\n\r\nand then manually port over
  each characters modified PATH ? ? ? ?\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nPLEASE
  PLEASE\r\n\r\nlend any and all advice on how i could\r\n\r\ncomplete a fairly simple
  yet fleshed out + usable\r\n\r\nmodified typeface\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nas always my thanks
  and praise to all\r\n\r\nthe supportive and knowledgeable members\r\n\r\nhere at
  TYPOPHILE .\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nPEAC BE WITH YOU \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nAerosyn-Lex"

    the font onto the applicatio, or through the file menu. (There are settings in
    the Preferences window concerning th conversion of OpenType fonts; you should
    make sure that all features are imported when the font is opened.)\r\n"

      best?\r\n\r\nWould I need to have an OTF file or can I use the mac formats of

  body: 'A-L, I have never knowingly encountered either a LWFN or FFIL file. Wht are
    they? OTF, on the other hand, will open a charm with FontLab or FontLab Studio.
    If you have the software, why don''t you just open one of the font files? Only
    one way to verify if FontLab will open a font file: try it.'

  body: "Aerosyn-Lex, \r\n\r\nany Mac font editor from Fontlab Ltd. (TypeTool, Fontographer,
    FontLab, FontLab Studio) can open LWFN and FFIL files (it's better to open the
    FFIL files since they contain metrics and kerning, and will automatically locate
    the matching LWFN file). \r\n\r\nThe Windows versions of our software cannot open
    these files, except TransType SE and TransType Pro for Windows, that can convert
    them into PC formats. Also, FontLab Studio 5 for Windows can open LWFN and FFIL
    files if they have been encoded as MacBinary (.bin) or BinHex (.hqx). \r\n\r\nRegards,
    \r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"
