  the header image of http://www.laurenslatest.com/ and I can't remember the origin
  of the other one. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance! :)\r\n\r\np.s. i'm not too sure how
  to describe these fonts, hope the terms, cursive and handwritten script, fit the
  bill. "

    Cezanne for the caps, and perhaps Rodin for the lowercase.\r\n\r\nedit: and, I'd
    suggest when you need assistance, create a new thread to prevent your request
    being overlooked or confusing the conversations."
