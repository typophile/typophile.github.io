body: We use Nimrod for body copy in a newsmag. It is a reliable face, given our printing
  conditions, but body copy is the only use it is worth for, as when set bigger than
  16 pt it looks, well, weird. However I would like to set some pull quotes/leads
  in a serif face so I&#39;m looking for a font which would be close in its characterics
  to Nimrod yet a little more sophisticated, so that it could be used for body copy,
  and also for nicelooking pull quotes in 25 pt. Or should I introduce a second face?
  Or perhaps a family with book/display sets? PS. Other faces used in the mag are
  Interstate &#40;headlines/pullquotes/leads&#41; and Syntax &#40;small sansserif
  body text&#41;

  body: Nimrod is a great old stalwart. Paul Luna of the Oxford dictionaries loves
    it. <BR>And as far as I&#39;m concerned it looks weird at large sizes <i>because</i>
    it&#39;s a &#34;real&#34; text face! <BR> <BR>Would you be interested in commissioning
    a display cut of Nimrod? That would really be ideal. <BR>Otherwise try looking
    into Scotch faces that are narrow and have high stroke contrast. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I&#39;m not sure how it will get along with Syntax or Interstate, but Storm&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/hercules.html"> Hercules</a> is worth a look.
    It looks great big. <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: 'Would you be interested in commissioning a display cut of Nimrod? That would
    really be ideal.  <BR>--------- <BR>Hehe, I wonder how much that would cost....
    not that I could afford that anyway - our boss still thinks that serious investing
    in quality design is a futile thing to do - just curious. <BR> <BR>Anyway, both
    Utopia and Hercules seem alluring, but I can afford only one of them. And with
    that comes another question: how do you determine if a textface is appropriate
    for a particular task, if you don&#39;t have a chance to see it set in a large
    text block together with other faces you intend to use? In my experience a test
    line of a font may seem rather good, but when I set it in the particular page,
    columns and all, for one reason or another it simply doesn&#39;t work. Is there
    a way to know it beforehand? Does this kind of knowing come with education or
    experience &#40;I don&#39;t have much of either&#41;, with intricate knowledge
    about the letterforms? Or do we all just kind of make a &#39;blind shot&#39; and
    see what we get?'

  body: PDF specimens &#40;and a good laser printer&#41; are absolutely necessary
    to judge a good text font. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure where you can find a specimen
    of Utopia, but Storm&#39;s expert pages are great. Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/expert/hert.html">
    text cuts</a> of Hercules. Use the &#34;Download this PDF&#34; link in the upper
