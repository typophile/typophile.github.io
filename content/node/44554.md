  body: "Maybe I'm being way too fussy with my modest efforts at making fonts.  Those
    bumps (which weren't the worst) aren't noticible in a document even at 36 points
    on screen, but set in a block of text, the font looks pretty cludgy, so I'm guessing
    they don't help. \r\n\r\nI tend to look very cloesly at any font I'm going to
    use, becasue I design signage. It's been ages since I used garamond, and at the
    time I set it with Lettraset and blew the letters up to 28\" with a projector.\r\n\r\nIt
    is displayed as Open Type in the font folder. If it has been automatically \"transformed\"
    at what stage would that happen & why? I haven't seen anything look quite this
    mangled that wasn't meant to look mangled. I can believe that's what happened
    because it just looks too haphazard to be the result of poor workmanship. It's
    more like the a vetorized image scan. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: "Monotype Garamond in digital format is based on (probably digitized from)
    the 12-point (and under) size master drawings from the metal range of Monotype
    Garamond. Those originals (the smaller sizes) were very crusty and \"antiqued\"
    looking, and the rustic quality is carried through in the digital version. It
    won't clear up if you get a PostScript version because that is the way it was
    designed. \r\n\r\nNote: this is one of the 'Jannon' Garamonds, so if you want
    something smooth for display with this same feel, be careful about what you select.
    If you want a real Garamond, and it has to be smooth, straight and regular, I'd
    suggest Adobe Garamond. Get the original, not Premier Pro, because the new Premier
    Pro has some of this rustic edge quality as well, which I imagine would be obvious
    at large sizes. \r\n\r\nAn option if you want a very clean, crisp Garalde is Galliard,
    which was drawn and digitized very cleanly. Scales up very well. "

  body: "<cite>Could it be that this font comes with HP printers?</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\nOne
    of the problems I've noticed at my school is that the \"default\" Windows Garamond
    often seems to be replaced (by a printer-resident) version when a document is
    sent to a laser printer.  The kerning of documents becomes horrible, presumably
    because the spacing remains from the original document, but the glyphs are substituted.
    \ I once found the setting on a colleague's computer to force embedding of all
    fonts, and that fixed the printing problem, but I find it strange that all fonts
    aren't embedded by default in documents sent to a laser printer.  Is it really
    standard for Windows to do this, or is our Windows installation just strange that
    way? (I use Linux most of the time, so haven't been forced to deal with it directly,
    myself.)\r\n\r\nst"

    drivers I've seen. I agree whole-heartedly that it can cause problems, and that
    in most cases this \"feature\" should be turned off.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
