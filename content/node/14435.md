    body: I'm sorry, I didn't relize DaFont was an illegal site. Please forgive me.
      Thank you for your help. Again, I deeply applogize. I've been given that site
      as a reference on here before and was just trying to use it as a reference because
      it offered a preview.

  body: Hi Joshua, we understand you linked to DaFont without knowing it was an illegal
    rip-off, so no harm done. Just be careful next time. ;^)

  body: DaFont is not really an illegal site, they just happen to ignorantly host
    some knockoffs. The operator is actually quite responsible about removing illegitimate
    fonts when informed.

  body: Just to make sure there's no misunderstanding -- the "illegal rip-off" I was
    referring to was the font, not the website. Otherwise we wouldn't link to DaFont
    at all. I recently IDed a freeware font available from DaFont which is the genuine
    article.
