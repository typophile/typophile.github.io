  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,

Looking to get some feedback on a logo I've been working on. The company is called Edible Adventures - Mobile cooking classes for kids. It's pretty self explanatory. Client is looking for a simple execution of her logo. It has to communicate food in a fun way and easy to read. Could be used as signage on vans/store front/stationary/marketing materials. 

Please take a few minutes to look it over. Let me know your thoughts/suggestions. 

Thanks in advance.

Anyway, a trap is for small sizes. When you set a font large (and
you have the time) you should -generally- remove the trapping.

		<div class="commentbody">I had the same through hrant did, I think the bites are a bit overdone. Your bite on the "v" seems a hair awkward as well, it just sort of shortens the letter and I think will get lost as a "bite" as smaller sizes.

I really like the overall feel, but I think there's be a bigger impact with less chewing. Maybe even just one bite? "Edible" already clearly implies eating and probably doesn't need one. Just thinking out loud :)</div>

The alignment of the subline seems a bit coincidental? It might also be a bit small, depending on target size/application of this. Did you try using a secondary font that's less loud for the subline, which could also allow for it to be subordinate without being tiny?

BTW, how about a few crumbs lying around, from the nibbling?* I'd think adventurously eating kids don't leave clean white space… :-)  But maybe that's too much.
(* Maybe those could click with the subline in some way, size-/placement-wise.)

The subline doesn't fit imo. Did you try it in italics?

Nit-picky, but have you tried a more random placement of the crumbs? Right now I'm seeing the number 5 of a 3D dice :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If the angles are slightly off it will just look wrong; and if the subline font isn't going to be the same, chances are very small the angles will match. Fortunately you can find something close and then skew it slightly to match. Or you could use a really "loose" font with no discernible inclination angle, like a handwriting font* or maybe a flamboyant cursive.

* Maybe this: http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/4305557811

More:
- If you could -nicely- chop the head of the "t" in "adventures", you would end up with a nice tight fit between the two lines.
- You need to work on the spacing, especially in "adventures". I might even make a custom "v" (a roundish form) to fill its space better.
- The crumbs are spaced a bit too regularly.

		<div class="commentbody">I think you should look at how the S is affected by the bite. The lower left of the S now only connects to the main part of the character with a very tiny slice. Perhaps you could try keeping this connecting strip a bit thicker, or try what happens if you completely let the lower left terminal 'snip off', so to speak. Perhaps rotate the bite by a few degrees counter-clockwise so the lower left bit of the S doesn't become to small, either.

I'd probably also slightly nudge 'edible' to the right, so the space between the ascender of the d in 'adventures' and the e of 'edible' isn't so tight.

And I was also going to suggest chopping off the top of the t, as hrant already mentioned.</div>
