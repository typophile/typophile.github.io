body: Hi. <BR>I&#39;m doing a handwriting font for a client who is in turn working
  with the company that will be paying for the font &#40;Don&#39;t know their budget&#41;.
  It&#39;s a single weight but has alternates for a bunch of the most oft used chars.
  <BR> <BR>What should I be charging for a fully exclusive license? Any insights would
  be helpful.

  body: It depends on how long you expect it to take you Matt, with a job like this
    I&#39;d charge it at a good daily rate.

  body: I have to disagree with Miles here. Calculating a price of an exclusive piece
    of work should not be done solely on the amount of time it takes to complete it.
    If you are pricing an exclusive typeface design there are many more factors to
    consider.

    be nice to get some more info for future reference. '

  body: Although it shouldn&#39;t be solely on time, a time-based calculation should
    probably set your minimum, I&#39;d think. <BR> <BR>T

  body: What level of exclusivity? How long? &#40;1,2,3, years. All rights forever?&#41;
    <BR> <BR>How large a user base for the final font? &#40;1, 5, 10, 2500 workstations&#41;
    One city, one country?  <BR> <BR>The client. Is it editorial, advertising, corporate,
    government? <BR> <BR>Those are three off the top of my head.
