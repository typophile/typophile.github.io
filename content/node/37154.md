  body: "Derek, I actually don't think the serif is Mrs Eaves: look at the short top
    stroke of the a, the hooked y, the huge bowl of the g, and the lower x-height.
    It does, however, <em>feel</em> like Mrs Eaves, although I'm not sure what it
    actually is.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oops, overlapping posts."

    use Mrs. Eaves on invitations.\r\n\r\nNow I want to know what that is too."
