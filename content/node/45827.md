body: "I have never designed type, but for the project that I am working on, I want
  to design a capital '\u03A9' in Blackmoor LET, which does not have an '\u03A9' as
  part of its character set.  I thought to combine the capital 'O' and lower-case
  'g' to make an '\u03A9'.  This is what I've come up with so far.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blackmoor_omega_4762.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  will be used for a logo treatment for a youth group called \"Omega Student Ministries.\"
  \ I like the sort of tattooed / distressed look that Blackmoor has.  I am a bit
  worried, however, that it could have too much of a \"Pirates of the Carribean\"
  feel to it, however.  If someone would like to suggest another font, then please
  do.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any suggestions you may have.\r\n\r\n<em>Edited
  for grammar.</em>"

  body: I think because it is for a logo you can afford a little creative license
    with the shapes. I think it is fun. Perhaps you could tighten the closure a bit
    more?

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nYes. That is more Omega-like. \r\n\r\nI wonder if the wings
    aren't a little too detailed? Do you need all the small noise nearer to the omega?
    I also  think the word \"omega\" is too close. Maybe even raise the Omega up."

    well taken.  Thanks!  I guess I thought it would be more complex than it turned
    out to be.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"
