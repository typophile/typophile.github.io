  body: "Of course, my intention should have been obvious to long-time Typophile participants.\r\n\r\nThe
    ClearType font was designed to reduce ambiguity... and that related to the issue
    of designing typefaces to help dyslexics, which has been referenced in a number
    of threads. And since I suggested modifying the alphabet as a way to deal with
    that... referring to an occasional visitor here who says that the letter K needs
    to be re-shaped because of Hindu sacred history seemed obvious as well.\r\n\r\nI
    regret that my attempt to lighten the discussion caused disappointment and/or
    distress to the thread originator.\r\n\r\nAs to the topic of this thread: I don't
    think that turning a Fraktur k upside down will produce a useful alternative k.
    As I noted, when I found what was meant by a \"Fraktur k\", it was clear that
    it was built from elements of a right-side-up t and a right-side-up l.\r\n\r\nSo
    turning it upside down would produce something that looked obviously like an upside
    down letter. Of course, one could turn the general shape upside down, and redo
    the serifs from scratch."
