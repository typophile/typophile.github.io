  we used Metal Letters that we would rub off onto our stencil and then handcut the
  letter from the rub off. The computer has made cutting letters much easier, but
  the one good thing about the Metal Letters is that as the type size increased, the
  serifs didn't scale, they were kept thin and this made for a nicer looking font.
  The computer fonts at large sizes all look heavy as they are simply scaling up the
  font.\r\n \r\nI thought I read somewere that OpenType now supports Alternate characters,
  so I was wondering if it would be possible to create an OpenType Font with Fontlab
  that would alternate the character set above certain sizes.  So 0 - 90 points would
  be one set of characters, and 90 - What Ever would be another.  Giving us a closer
  look to our old Metal Letters. (This substituation would accure maybe two or three
  time depending on the font.)\r\n \r\nDoes that make sense?  Is it possible? I know
  I could create three different fonts and suggesst sizes, but I would rather have
  it all in one font and automated.\r\n\r\nThem old timers knew what they were doing
  and had good looking fonts, now if my computer was smart enough to do the same.\r\n

  body: "The official OpenType approach is to have separate fonts, but have optical
    size info in the fonts that can (in principle) automate the size-switching. The
    only problem is that except for some flavor of TeX, no application that I know
    of is taking advantage of this as yet.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    So I am not sure if it would be a good idea, If fonts would be switching automatically,
    messing up the spacing and so on.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

    designers need, the computer switching them in and out automatically is guaranteed
    to annoy a lot of designers."

    as ligatures and small-cap replacement is now.

  body: "Yup, just so, Ken.\r\n\r\nInDesign actually already does this automatically
    (with a user-controlled preference) for good old multiple master fonts. There
    just aren't very many of those these days.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    third-party support won't really be an issue anymore."

    \ So can anyone give an example of how with OpenType I can substitute a glyph

  body: "OpenType was originally going to support multiple master functionality as
    well, but it was yanked from the OpenType spec way back around early 1998, IIRC.
    Although conspiracy theorists may argue otherwise, the main reasons were that
    there was a big support cost for multiple master, and end users hadn't embraced
    MM functionality very enthusiastically. The guy who was engineering manager for
    the type department at the time (Dan Mills) thought that we would find it a lot
    easier to make OpenType successful if it didn't include MM.\r\nI believe he was
    right about that, although I for one miss MM functionality.\r\n\r\nAlthough it
    didn't help that our partner in OpenType, Microsoft, was not particularly enthusiastic
    about MM, this was not the the core reason for Dan's decision.\r\n\r\n<cite>So
    can anyone give an example of how with OpenType I can substitute a glyph for another
    glyph if the point size is > then a given number?</cite>\r\n\r\nTo the best of
    my knowledge, it isn't possible.\r\n\r\nTheoretically you could get equivalent
    results by using elaborate TrueType delta hinting, but in practice it wouldn't
    work (too much work, and too many high-end rasterizers are ignoring delta hints
    these days anyway).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
