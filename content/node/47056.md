body: "New Logo!: \r\n\r\nupdate: swashes?... \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/norcal_201_6058.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  am creating a new logo for my company, Norcal designs (www.norcaldesigns.com), and
  decided to post my work from concept to finish up here for helpful advice and critiques.
  NorCal Designs is a graphic design company and I create any kind of corporate collateral
  (business cards, letter heads, company logo work, etc.) but I specialize in website
  design & creation for small businesses.\r\n\r\nThis is the first piece of concept
  work for my new logo based on Emigre's Sabbath Black. I am not sure on the look
  and feel that I want to achieve yet so hopefully it will develop along the way.\r\n\r\nBelow
  is my sketched out version of the lettering as well as the traced paths in illustrator
  (which took forever) and the result. At the very bottom is Emigre's Sabbath Black
  to show you my starting point.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/norcal_process
  copy_6534.jpg]\r\n\r\nI am looking for ideas on where to take this, interesting
  blackletter variations I can try adding, any ideas on improvement. It is very unfinished
  both in the concept and lettering. for now...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    letters are too thick ('N') and some are too thin ('r'). Why is the 'i' so ornate
    and composed of two strokes? The 'g' is hard to read, but that could be caused
    by the crazy 'i'.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also the 'l' needs at least a bit
    of an ascender. It looks more like an 'i' than your 'i' does."

    strokes. I am still researching different blackletter ideas for the next version.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I would say, the letter \"D\" of \"Designs\" needs more weight in the spine.
    \r\n\r\nIf you stand back and look at the logo, the eye cannot decipher that portion
    of the design (because the lines are too fine). Your client definitely wants the
    name to be fully legible. The \"D\" has a disproportionate amount of (what will
    visually translate as) white space in comparison to the other characters; so when
    you stand back, it appears as though there is a gap in the text. \r\n    "

    so large and, um, empty. not very blackletterish. the s's jumped out at me as
    being MUCH too wide. the counter of the g feels too small and the tail perhaps
    too large. the \"feet\" on i and l could be a bit more discreet. the e looks top-heavy
    and seems to be attacking the letter to the right."

    is a term used a lot in my area, i don't think the N or C will get passed too
    many people. Also the term norcal became popular along with a clothing brand with
    the word norcal set in blackletter along with a star. \r\n\r\nAlso I like blackletter
    more than i am afraid of the motorcycle stigma attached to it. I am not specifically
    looking for a \"blackletter\" feel. I simply like the letterforms.\r\n\r\nI am
    trying to come up with some treatment for the type to get rid of the motorcycle
    feel. Any ideas would be appreciated."

  body: "The scrolling, circular curls...I think, lessens the nuance of \"motorcycle\".\r\n\r\nThat
    \"D\" is looking more legible, except the spine that was added looks like it is
    getting steam-rolled into the curls. See how it slants at about a 70 degree angle?
    I would straighten that out a bit. Also lessening the lower-left curl on the \"D\".
    That curl is disproportionately large compared to every other curl in the design...and
    it is creating alot of white space.  That will help to tighten up the logo into
    a more unified image."

    have to use this as a secondary mark if i can't figure out a treatment for it
    that gives me the look i want.\r\n\r\nIt just seems annoying to me the continued
    association of stigmas to blackletter. There is the whole other thread about negative
    associations due to nazi use (even though Hitler banned its ussage). So now I
    am looking for ways to make it more friendly and give off a design-ery feel."

    sure the rest are. It's just that it's a rather stylized letterform, so the association
    is a bit stronger with some very specfic uses:\r\n\r\n - religion\r\n - news papers\r\n
    - germany\r\n - tattoos\r\n - gangs\r\n - motorcycles\r\n - heavy metal\r\n\r\nIt's
    actually a fairly varied list of associations if one things about it. \r\n\r\n"

    letterform because of it's lack of use, and then only abundantly for the associations
    that you mentioned. I am looking for ways to make it more versatile. To create
    a look that does not associate with any of these groups. (of course the type by
    itself isn't my attempt, it is just my starting point).\r\n\r\n@vintagesignman.
    Lol i will tighten that gap. But i also really want to have to use a Pi ligature
    now! Cool logo, but this is sort of the look i want to get away from. Are you
    showing it for the swashes?"

    none of these are based on typical \"motorcycle\" blackletter forms, so they don't
    help me much. I need to find more typical blackletter that are differentiated
    by their type treatments.\r\n\r\nI think Ekrine might look motorcyclish without
    the beautiful uniform swashes. By the way is there a term I can use to describe
    more classically associated blackletter styles besides motorcyclish?"
