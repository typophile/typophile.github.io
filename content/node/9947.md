  body: I agree with Chris Futura is fine. My only reaction to the card is 4 color
    process printing for a business card? Maybe you can justify it if you gang up
    your business cards with a promotional postcards print them at the same time.

  body: I like the illustration too.  <BR> <BR>Why 4 color process? Color illustration
    by an illustrator coud be a good reason? But is more expensive of course. <BR>
    <BR>You,re not sur about the font. The best way for me is  trying fonts and judge
    the result. <BR> <BR>Have you try other than Futura?  Here some examples. <BR>

  body: 'What I meant was: &#34;What do you want it to do that Futura isn&#39;t doing?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>I could give more suggestions than you could sift through, but it depends
    on what you want the design to &#39;say&#39; to people.'

  body: As you see, there is a lots of typeface you can use to replace Futura, of
    course if you want to.

  body: Gokhan, what I would do on your card is replace the / with a bullet or remove
    the extra space before and after the/. I don&#39;t think the typeface is an issue
    especially when they see the great illustration. This is one case where you shouldn&#39;t
    over think the card. Just keep it simple.
