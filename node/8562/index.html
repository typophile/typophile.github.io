		<div class="commentbody">Matha, that would never work, at least not enough. <BR>It would be nice to have such a mechanism in place, but we couldn't <i>rely</i> on it. <BR> <BR>Keith, the benefits of ATypI are in large part &quot;intangible&quot;. For some people it's an obligation of sorts, and for a lot of people it's not a &quot;sound investment&quot;: you become a member if you love type. And John is right, you should be thinking how <i>you</i> could help. <BR> <BR>One very tangible benefit of ATypI membership is being able to ask question on the discussion list: you'll possibly get an expert reply, and usually get some usable insight. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Hrant and John, I agree&hellip; I joined ATypI because I love type, and no one would choose to study type design because he/she wants to make tons of money. So, yes, I think the most important thing is the community that you get when you join an association like ATypI&hellip; <BR> <BR>BUT, with the internet, it might be just as easy to get support from other typographer/type designers&hellip; A good example is this board. I would still like to see tangible support and benefits, beause it is not cheap to join. I'm really not the kind who thinks about economic returns&hellip; it's just that I don't have a ton of money to spend. <BR> <BR>I'm more than happy to help&hellip; I would in fact like to get some local involvement for the next ATypI, and to involve myself. <BR> <BR>K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant said <BR> <BR>&gt; It would be nice to have such a mechanism in place, but we couldn't rely on it.  <BR> <BR>No, we certainly coudn't rely on it. But there is a new trend in collecting money for charitable purposes : the direct debit. You contribute a smallish sum of money every month without even noticing. It helps the organisation in question to plan ahead because they know in advance what's coming in. <BR> <BR>&gt; the benefits of ATypI are in large part &quot;intangible&quot;.  <BR> <BR>I agree with this, but I think part of the problem is that new members come to ATypI with preconceived ideas of what these benefits are and can be very easily disappointed. I know that the fiasco with the book in Rome disappointed me but I've gotten over it and I'll live to fight another day. <BR> <BR>Matha <BR> <BR></div>
