  I make my testprints? If so, which format should I use. Does hinting help for prints?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper

  body: "<em>Does hinting help for prints?</em>\r\n\r\nIt depends. It definitely makes
    a visible difference on common laser printers.\r\n\r\nWith hints, stems that are
    different may look the same in the printout. Without hints, stems that are the
    same may look different."

  body: I did test prints (laser printer, 1200dpi) without hinting, with FL autohinting,
    with AFDK autohinting and with my own manual hints. All hinted versions printed
    better than the no-hinted in text sizes (manual method is the best one). No difference
    with poster sizes.

  body: "If you draw the fonts as Postscript curves then you should test them as Postcript
    fonts. Converting to TrueType curves will introduce deformations in your curves
    that do not exist in your working files. \r\n\r\nAs for hinting, it\u2019s best
    to not hint test fonts unless you\u2019re working with a printer that has true
    Postscript support <em>and</em> you\u2019re printing light weights at small sizes
    and find that you have serious problems with stem weights varying.  Printers that
    use various PS emulation systems do not always interpret hints correctly and will
    sometimes produce deformed curves. Printers that do not even support Postscript
    do some really wacky stuff when converting the curves and should never be used
    to proof fonts. Never use the Fontlab autohinter as it produces bad hints that
    will deform curves in any laser printer. Even with hinting you will still have
    problems with light fonts at small sizes and should just proof these fonts at
    larger sizes.\r\n\r\nMake an effort to learn what your laser printer has trouble
    with so you can think about it when you\u2019re proofing. For example, most laser
    printers cannot print hairline fonts (~40 unit stems @ 1000 UPM) consistently
    at less than 24 points. If you know that your outlines are correct and it still
    prints poorly, you have to accept this limit of the technology and just work around
    it. It can be a lot more efficient to just run the FDK stem weight checking script
    and review that than to deal with screwy printouts."
