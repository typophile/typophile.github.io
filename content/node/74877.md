  SENSIBILITY</strong>\r\n<em>Shinntype sans serif super-family </em>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/SandS.pdf\">Sense
  & Sensibility specimen</a> (pdf)\r\n\r\n<strong>Artist Statement</strong>\r\nOver
  time, many of the functors of page layout have become formalized within the concept
  of typeface as morphic categories, categories being the semantic building blocks
  of perception at the level of both individual physiology and social production.
  \L\r\nFirst size, then case, skew, weight, horizontal scale, serifization and grading
  have evolved as the axes about which type families may be configured. To these Nick
  Shinn has added a cultural axis, with modern (Sense: minimalist) and old style (Sensibility:
  humanist) posited as the poles of the sans serif genre.\r\n\r\n<strong>Designer
  Statement</strong>\r\nShinntype\u2019s Sense and Sensibility comprise a super-family
  of two large x-height, semi-condensed, contrasting styles of roman with italic,
  sharing stem widths, vertical metrics, and approximate horizontal scale. There are
  eight weights, with alternate figures and identical tab figure width across all
  32 fonts.\r\nAscenders are taller than capitals, and descenders quite short. This,
  along with compact horizontal proportions and exemplary fit, provides an assertive
  presence in headlines and accommodates tight leading in text. \r\n\r\n<strong>Manufacturer
  Statement</strong>\r\nSense and Sensibility are the new go-to types with the big
  look and all the weights. Compact, elegant and strong, they command any page --
  from the largest headline to the smallest text, for corporate, publishing and advertising
  work. \r\nCopy fit is almost identical between Sense and Sensibility, and between
  roman and italic. This means that faces may be switched in a layout, or combined,
  to subtly change flavor without re-formatting -- use this feature to offer clients
  two options with very little effort, facilitating sign-off.\r\nSense and Sensibility
  have full European Latin coverage for 40+ languages, and are competitively priced
  -- the family packages offer exceptional value at $149 each, and the super-family
  of all 32 fonts is only $249, a per-font cost of $7.78!\r\nAvailable from Faces,
  Fonthaus, Fonts.com, FontShop, FontSpring, Fontworks, Linotype, MyFonts, Paratype,
  Phil\u2019s Fonts, Veer, and YouWorkForThem.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Shinntype</strong>\r\nShinntype
  was founded in 1999 to market Nick Shinn's type designs. Shinn\u2019s background
  as an artist, writer, art director and graphic designer informs his eclectic type
  designs, which run the gamut from revivals to experimental work exploring new technology,
  and are used in everything from packaging and advertising to internet, book, magazine,
  and newspaper publishing, around the world. He has produced many retail fonts, including
  the casual classic Fontesque, the unicase-monowidth type Panoptica, and the OpenType
  script face Handsome Pro, as well as commissioned work for corporations and publications
  such as Canada's national newspaper, <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, for which Sense
  and Sensibility were originally designed."

    all at the same time), but:\r\n\r\n- I have used a lot of similar material in
    previous PDFs, so it is something of a cumulative, aggregate work.\r\n- It is
    very useful as a quality-check of the fonts.\r\n\r\nThis was originally a newspaper
    face, and I can also see it being used in corporate or marketing work, but not
    so much for books and journals that use small caps, on account of the large x-height
    and short descenders. The caps are quite small already. So the extra work I put
    into it before general release was devoted to adding the Black weight, and extending
    language coverage. The only substantial OpenType feature is alternate figures,
    and a few extra pre-composed fractions."

    David Pratt's (who comissioned the types), which he saw in Ricardo Santos' Lisboa,
    and I developed to the specific needs of the Globe's redesign format. I had explored
    the super-family idea previously, in Eunoia and Panoptica, but in a quite different
    way. \r\n\r\nI don't know about \"strictly commercial logic\": so far in a month
    of release at MyFonts, Sensibility is doing quite well, but no one has licensed
    Sense! I would never have anticipated that, and would have expected Sense to be
    the more \"commercial\" face. That's only one month at one distributor, but it
    goes to show. "

  body: "Well, except for the missed opportunity to be remembered for the next hundred
    years as the designer of Globe New Roman, I'd say you're doing well. Actually,
    since the Globe and Mail's new look is using faces designed by you, even if not
    ones specifically designed for the Globe and Mail, perhaps it is still possible...\r\n\r\nAfter
    visiting your web site, I noted with a shock that you had custom fonts there named
    Globe and Mail News, Globe and Mail Sans, and Globe and Mail Text. And so I thought
    I was mistaken, although I was sure I saw in the thread the face of yours they
    were now using specifically named - and it wasn't one of those. However, looking
    a bit harder cleared up the mystery - those three faces were commissioned for
    its previous redesign, which was also your doing.\r\n\r\nWorldwide is, of course,
    just a tad too condensed <em>in order</em> to provide something different in its
    overall appearance from other faces that are easily available (i.e. Century Expanded,
    Times Roman). And then there's Williams Caslon Text by another designer here.
    And there's the Starlng revival.\r\n\r\nWho will design the new typeface that
    will dethrone Times Roman, becoming the ubiquitous text typeface for the 21st
    Century? (Could Georgia be a candidate for this honor?)\r\n\r\nOf course, maybe
    that honor isn't up for grabs - or we'd already be drowning in Palatino."

    But when I came to compare the two, there were some characters in Sense that I
    did not like so much, such as the spurless lowercase 'b', the lowercase 't' and
    'u', and the uppercase Q, which in the black wheights becomes a little too fat,
    imho. These characters, plus the fact that I really liked the Sensibility italic,
    made me go for Sensibility. \r\n\r\nI had one question considering the spacing:
    I think it sets very tight, so tight I might even consider spacing it out for
    longer texts. This is of course very economical, which is useful for a news face,

    range of interpretations, but I meant a typeface designed with the commercial
    aspect as its priority, and all the others subsided to it.\r\nSince it\u2018s
    commissioned by a publisher, it seems to me it may have suffered from a bigger
    pressure in terms of development time, and some constraints dictated by its intended
    usage. Mostly, I was thinking about your developed general criticism towards standardization,
    which these typefaces seem to escape.\r\nMy thoughts, mostly, nothing so rationalized.\r\n\r\nI
    think the main reason for which Sense is staying behind is that you have mixed
    its influences (the forms \"skeletons\") without a 100% of success in their integration.
    More or less like different traditions and cultures in the United States in the
    last 100+ years\u2026 :-)\r\n\r\nSaid this, I have been happy to use Duffy Script
    and Goodchild, which I managed to have licensed by my \"boss\", and I think Goodchild
    should be remastered with small capitals and a good basic Opentype functionality.
    Duffy is a little messy in Opentype terms, but it\u2019s one of your best faces
    with Oneleigh, Richler and Panoptica (the serif version). I would really love
    to have Richler on sale, but I understand it is exclusively licensed\u2026"

    Sense and Sensibility are semi-condensed (like Myriad) and tightly fitted (like
    Helvetica), and the Regular is on the heavy side (like Gill). So they're quite
    the opposite of Verdana. But that's their personality. I would certainly consider
    experimenting with how you set them in text, or whatever genre. Despite their
    density, they seemed to work quite well for text in the Globe, where they also
    picked up a fair amount of press gain. Not for huge tracts of text, more for captions,
    decks and sidebars -- but I don't believe that suitability for extended immersive
    reading is the be-all and end-all criteria for text setting, certainly not for
    a sans serif.\r\n\r\nSensibility does have some openness introduced by the tails
    on a, d, l and u.\r\n\r\n<em> ...it may have suffered from a bigger pressure in
    terms of development time, and some constraints dictated by its intended usage.
    </em>\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of development time, fortunately. And constraints
    are useful in helping define functionality and usefulness. Erik Spiekermann takes
    this position too, IIRC. However, I wouldn't like to work with constraints all
    the time, and I'm fortunate to be able to do both commissioned work, and \"unconstrained\"
    retail projects -- self-publishing, which would be termed Vanity Press if I were
    an author.\r\n"
