  any of yall could point me in the right locations. I am looking for two things.
  \r\n\r\n1. A neon sign similiar to the old 50 -60s? style. (like a diner or apollo
  theatre, no times square or  typical \"open\" signs though.)\r\n\r\n2. Old faded
  painted advertisements on a brick wall or building in general. "

  body: "If you walk on Park Avenue South between 20th and 30th streets, look up and
    to your right and left as you pass each cross street and you will see several
    faded painted signs on the higher brick buildings. Also, on 17th Street between
    6th and 7th there is a painted advertisement for \"horses to let\". In the 20's
    off of 7th Ave there are signs advertising 'pinking shears'.\r\n\r\nAs to old
    neon, if you walk down 1st 2nd and 3rd Aves from the mid 20s to Chinatown, you
    will see a bunch."
