  a squared sans serif that looks a lot like Bank Gothic, Eurostile, or Square 721.
  But it has pure horizontal and vertical edges that aren't curved at all, a very
  small corner radius, and the C and O letters are indeed square with the same height
  and width."

  body: looks like someone started with bank gothic and altered it... or even just
    drew it in illustrator from scratch, not a very difficult set of characters
