body: "Okay, type ID is usually a strong point for me; I'm a fairly resourceful individual,
  but I'm stumped this time.\r\n\r\nFor the two years I've lived in Manchester, CT,
  I've really come to appreciate well-designed signs. The \"City of Village Charm\"
  has a wonderful Main Street with lots of M/P \"shoppes,\" many of which have signs
  of scrupulous character. I have especially taken fancy to Manchester's street signs.\r\n\r\nBut
  enough about me &mdash; on with the IDing...\r\n\r\nThe first one, from an upholstery
  shop, should be easy for many of you &mdash; it's a fairly common display face,
  but I just can't find its ID.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/upholstery_3533.jpg]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe
  next face adorns all Main St street signs. I know what it's not (Helena, Campagnile,
  ActionIs), and I don't completely think it's a custom face. Any bites?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Main_Street_Signage_01_6616.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Main_Street_Signage_02_5369.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Main_Street_Signage_03_6434.jpg]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood
  luck, and thanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\nRay"

  body: You are welcome, Ray. I like your website - especially the interactive percussion
    setup. You just need to add samples of your work to the Music page.
