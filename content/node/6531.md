  company.   <BR> <BR>Interstate is used in the logo and elsewhere.  I suppose the
  serif face needs to be modern and have a high x-height, but beyond that, I could
  use suggestions.  Thanks! <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: Why trying emulated the geometric non contrasted stuff in a serif counterpart?
    <BR> <BR>Interstate, is like Futura.  Fit with many good classic families, from
    Garamond &#40;one of the good one!&#41; to Bodoni &#40;same here!&#41;. Not at
    all with a contemporary serif family. <BR> <BR>You need to create a contraste
    rather than destroy it. <BR> <BR>Caecilia or &#34;Thesis&#34; Serif are not all
    a good choice to me &#40;sorry Stephen, generally I agree with you, not here&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Perhaps FF Celeste if you really want something &#34;new.&#34;

  body: I&#39;d pair Interstate with a serif that has a little heft and character
    of its own. Cronos seems too mushy and feminine to stand up to the crispness of
    Interstate. What about Bembo, or Scala, or Miller, or even Hrant&#39;s fave, Egyptienne?
    <BR> <BR>Or try an earthy serif like Adobe Caslon. Or go entirely post-modern
    and pair it with Filosofia.

    interesting. When Roger Black redesigned <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/">my
    local paper</a> &#40;the printed version, of course&#41; in 98/99 he used Interstate
    as the primary sans and paired it with Garamond. They have used Plantin and Century

    it, Interstate is rarely used for more than three lines of text, in headlines
    or the stand-first. But sometimes they do go berserk and use it in a whole sidebar.
    <BR> <BR>Recently, they have started using the whole gamut of widths and weight.
    Very distracting, IMO. They should just stick to what I think is the <i>original</i>
    Interstate, the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/regularcondensed/">Regular
    Condensed</a>. Funny, when I first noticed Interstate, I don&#39;t remember it
