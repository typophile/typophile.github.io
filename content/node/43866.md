body: "I am thinking of switching from Latex to Xetex, just because of the font facilities
  in Xetex -- but Xetex doesn't provide the microtypographic features of Latex: protrusion
  and font expansion. These are pretty subtle effects, but I find that they do make
  a difference in certain situations (e.g. with long documents or with pages that
  have narrow columns). It's not an obvious difference, but the small adjustments
  do make a slight improvement in the justification line. I understand that InDesign
  also offers microtypographic features (since August 07, according to Wikipedia).
  \r\n\r\nWhat do people think of these features? Are they an essential part of modern
  typography? (Even though they are, as practices, actually very old.)\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: "If I understand the features you are talking about correctly, they are useful
    only when their effect cannot be seen. Secondly, they are useful only when you
    can apply them globally (i.e., automatic, but with some penalty), rather than
    having to apply them as you see a need.\r\n\r\nWe used a set of our own macros
    with Plain TeX for 20 years, and did not have these features (we did write a letterspacing
    routine, which you absolutely have to have). And so, found other ways to achieve
    the same ends -- handling lines that were only a trifle overset. If a line is
    overset -- at least, with plain TeX, you see the value. In most lines, you will
    find one or more wordspaces surrounded by a pair of letters where optically, a
    lettle less space in that wordspace is needed. Take your overset values out of
    these spaces, and get a better line/paragraph. But of course, this isn't automatic.\r\n\r\nThe
    point is every layout engine has pluses and minuses, you just have to decide what
    is best & easiest for you."

  body: I use XeLaTeX, with Fontspec as an interface to the font calls, and yes, I
    do miss margin kerning. Font expansion I tend to think of as a mistake, and always
    turn it off, but margin kerning in LaTeX was great and is now, finally, implemented
    properly.

  body: "Thanks for the replies.\r\nYes, it's the margin kerning that I am mostly
    thinking about. It's a very cool feature of the microtype package, and actually
    makes differences that I can see both in terms of the visuals on the page (a margin
    that looks straighter, even though it is technically more crooked!) and in terms
    of a reduced number of over and under set lines. I suppose I've decided that the
    appeals of the fontspec package -- all the ways in which it opens up the OpenType
    features -- are more beneficial than microtype overall. But still, I wish I could
    have both. From the discussions on the xetex info page, (http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/xetex),
    it doesn't look like that is going to happen anytime soon.\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: "I think this is one of the areas where XeTeX's relative youth is a disadvantage.
    \r\n\r\nAlthough it is not quite a subtle as margin kerning, it is possible to
    set up hanging punctuation in plain (Xe)Tex and (Xe)LaTeX. This would give an
    alternative \"default\" which might be appropriate in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\n-Jacob"

  body: "\"it doesn\u2019t look like that is going to happen anytime soon.\"\r\n\r\nIt
    took years just to get this neatly implemented in LaTeX with the microtype package.
    Before then it was a bit of a hack, what with protcode.foo.\r\n\r\nIt may take
    a third party package in this case as well. I suspect Jacob is right \u2014 XeTeX
    is just a bit too young."
