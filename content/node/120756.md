  body: "AFAIK the letters in the word SINGER are not taken from a specific font.
    They are lettering with a wedge shaped style of serif called Latin.\r\nThe old
    Singer logos were built around an _S_ in this style. http://fr.wilogo.com/blog/2008/le-nouveau-logo-de-singer.html\r\nIts
    relatively simple to construct a capital letter font based on the letters in the
    word SINGER which are simple and not very distinctive. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SingerLogo_6416.jpg]\r\nDon"
