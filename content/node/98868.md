body: "Photofonts + Bitfonter + Novo Typo\r\nWe are experimenting with Bitfonter trying
  to produce some new photofonts. Does anyone have experience with the formats, the
  program and the final results? It seems that Fontlab stopped with further development
  with this program. Is there any progress? We love to hear from the fontlab community.
  Advice and help would be really appreciated.\r\nwww.novotypo.nl[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typespecimen-PURE_4624_5304.jpg]"
