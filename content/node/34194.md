  body: "Some of Manfred Klein's Blackletter fonts for FontFont have loops on the
    ascenders, but that is an unusual feature. I think your sample looks hand-lettered,
    however. Manfred has generously made most of his fonts available for free at <a
    href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein/index.htm\">TypOasis</a>,
    and he has helped with some of the <a href=http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/index.htm\">Blackletter
    revival</a> fonts on that site too, but I don't think this is among them.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hey Rainer;\r\n\r\nThanks for the link... it's very very close! \r\nTried
    looking within the search for similar but no luck. Any idea of where else I could
    look? Or maybe the creater of this has modified the serif's.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    your help- most appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers \r\nJason"
