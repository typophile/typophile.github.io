body: "Hi,\r\nI was wondering if anybody knew of any IBC restrictions on certain fonts.
  It's pretty specific on height minimums but I cant determine whether or not you
  can use lowercase letters and if there is a font list or description of unacceptable
  characters, weights etc. ADA signage literature is pretty specific in all of these
  areas. Dont want to break any IBC code on a current project.\r\nAny info/thoughts
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    It certainly does not provide all of the additional information you need, but
    it does specify:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>ANSI 703.2.2 Case. Characters shall be \r\nuppercase,
    lowercase, or a combination of \r\nboth.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOtherwise all instances
    of font references appear to be specific to characteristics of uppercase letters."
