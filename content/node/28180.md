body: "I\u2019d like to use a commercial font in a logo, but am worrying about licensing.
  Unless they\u2019re custom made, hand drawn designs, I guess all letter logo\u2019s
  somehow use at least one font, for which the designer has (or should have) a license.
  Font licenses, in general, prohibit adaptation of the font files, and of the glyphs
  and artwork included therein. Furthermore, the user is not allowed to redistribute
  the font by embedding or packaging it into another format. Now, how could a logo
  designer use such a licensed font, if he\u2019s supposed no to tweak nor adapt its
  glyphs so as them to meet the corporate identity with which the logo has to conform?
  Additionally, even if the glyphs were not to be modified, how could the designer
  supply his customer with ready-to-use .pdf, .eps, .tiffs, .jpeg files with the font
  glyphs embedded, or even converted into outlines?\r\n\r\nIf the use of the font
  as described above, would be allowed, should both designer and customer have a license?
  Suppose the designer wouldn\u2019t use the font, but for that one single assignment,
  could he have just his customer acquire the license and still use the font for the
  logo?\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re located in Belgium, Europe. I understand font licensing
  and copyright laws might differ between the member states of the European Community
  and the United States.\r\n\r\nPS Though I\u2019m a clandestine reader for some time
  now, I never bothered to subscribe as a posting member. So, because I\u2019m new
  to this forum, please excuse me for asking about a topic that presumably has been
  discussed many times before.\r\n\r\n[ EDIT: The first part of the above question
  was repeated under http://typophile.com/node/28107#comment-157338. ]\r\n"

    so check with the foundry. Especially if your're using a font from an unfamiliar
    foundry. They can write anything they like in the EULA and who but a lawyer knows
    if it's legally binding?\r\n\r\nFor instance: with P22 fonts, it's OK to use any
    font to do the logo. *However* if you use a dingbat, that is, a graphical illustration
    distributed as part of a font (like the font Zapf Dingbats), you need to pay an
    additional fee. T.26 has a similar rule - specifically allowing text fonts to
    be used, but not dingbats. Linotype and Adobe's EULAs seem to follow the general
    rule - go ahead and make a logo.\r\n\r\nMoral: don't be lazy. Don't use a dingbat
    for the graphical element in you logo, get out that Pen tool and draw it yourself!"

    the letters in a logo you are fine. Stefan is right in what he says about dingbat
    vs. letter.\r\n\r\nThe wording is meant to protect the work, but I fear, as you
    have pointed out, it actually keeps people from using the fonts because they misunderstand
    the EULA.\r\n\r\nFor a logo, you general turn the type to outlines anyway. Once
    you've done that, turned the type to outlines, in most cases the EULA does allow
    embedding after that. \r\n\r\n"

      misunderstand the EULA.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly the case. I contacted the foundry
      and the answer reads as follows: \"There is no problem to send a .eps to the
      client. The remark in the EULA is more about font embedding in PDF and that
      kind of stuff.\" I'm just perplexed by the legal inaccuracy with which these
      EULAs seem to have been formulated. If you interpret them strictly and literally
      (as you should, lawyer or not), then the end user's licensed use of the font
      would almost be restricted to its purchase only.\r\n\r\n> Once you\u2019ve done
      that, turned the type to outlines, in most cases\r\n> the EULA does allow embedding
      after that.\r\n\r\nThis would mean that the EULA could be evaded to such an
      extent that it becomes completely obsolete, just by this single side-step? I
      mean, in extremis one could convert the glyphs of an entire font into outlines,
      correct or alter the anchor points, modify the shapes at whish, or just let
      them be what they are, re-import them in a font production packet and \"embed\"
      them again into a new font file?"

  body: "Some EULAs do state that you cannot embed the font, outlines or otherwise.
    They even go so far as to put a percentage. \r\n\r\nThe foundries that don't allow
    embedding into PDFs are the same that are worried about people \"sucking\" the
    font information out of the PDFs, outlines or not.\r\n\r\nNot being able to embed
    a font into a PDF, such as one used in an InDesign file, makes it impossible to
    use the font for many projects. These foundries are limiting their client-base,
    but they are only doing what they think will protect there fonts from yet another
    form of font piracy.\r\n\r\nThere are loopholes. But, finding loopholes encourages
    foundries to make stickier EULAs. "

  body: "slightly related:\r\n\r\nacrobat 7 pro allows you to convert all type in
    a document to outlines using the PDF optimizer tool, which sidesteps the embedding
    issue completely, except as Tiffany notes.\r\n\r\nOne thing, though, Tiffany:
    \"...cannot embed the font, outlines or otherwise.\" - converted to curves, it
    no longer fits the legal definition of \"font,\" right? so embedding outlines
    - which technically are not \"embedded,\" as in attached alongside the document
    inside the PDF wrapper, but part of the document's postscript itself - would be
    outside the realm of a font's EULA, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt : http://www.hewnandhammered.com

    linotype BTW, trailblaze, we love you for it. sorry for frustration but I feel
    like blurting to somebody. \r\n\r\nMy question is, Is it actually feasible to
    outline all the fonts in a document as big as, say, a 300-page book? Does this
    just make the ripping process far too long and out of the question and painful
    and irritating? if i did this my problems would also melt away but I've shied
    away from it because I thought the size inflated far too much. \r\n\r\n--N"
