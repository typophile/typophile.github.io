body: "i went to typo skool sussing art work and typo design in the gud (ish) old
  days of letterpress, lead, tin and antimony in different % depending on print run
  length and style, all pre computer of course, but the crispness of physically impressing
  metal type into paper has never been surpassed, the fact that it took a day (at
  least) to make ready, a 16 page job with mixed type and halftones signified the
  end for the process.too time consuming, ergo too expensive, litho was the way forward,
  unless you are into specialist work on a vertical platen (caxton style press) which
  we had at the company, (not in use) but i wished i had the forsight to rescue it
  from the scrapyard along with the 20 foot high bonfire of type cases and hand carved
  wooden blocks. i still have a couple of small ones, a key and some stuff i will
  have to dig out but i remember trying to print a poster using hand carved wooden
  type at about 4\" tall (not me the type)  it was a nightmare, it had warped over
  the years, so it would \"spring\" ie because  the edges were not level it would
  bow up so you had to pack with pieces of paper along the sides to try and alleviate
  the prob. anyhoo after sanding down the face of the type and packing underneath
  to try and achieve a similar level you might?? achieve a run. that is rok n roll\r\ngod
  bless typophile love what you are about, still love fonts \r\ncheck me at steve
