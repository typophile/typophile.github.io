  body: "Univers CE fonts are available in PostScript Type 1 or TrueType formats,
    and they have the \"Central European\" character set.\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/137563/universcentraleuropean55roman-font.html\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/137566/universcentraleuropean55roman-charactermap.html\r\n\r\nUnivers
    LT is the Western European character set (with a Euro symbol). If you license
    the OpenType Com fonts (see http://www.linotype.com/12641/univers55roman-font.html#format),
    or the Pro fonts, you get both the Central European and the Western European glyph
    coverage! But if you need a non-OpenType font, you have to pick one or the other
    :(\r\n\r\nMy guess is that most people use OpenType now anyway. But I could be
    wrong!"
