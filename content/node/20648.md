  body: thanks for posting a larger sample. but think i was right, although might
    be the Regular & Black weights. Maybe one of the infamous mystery solvers can
    have the final say?

    a fair cop, but Typophile is to blame.

    a fair and open discussion. No deletion.

  body: "Grumpy - Whenever I can, I link to FontShop showings as well, and so do others,
    as FontShop pays for this Type Identification Board. Why haven't you ever attacked
    <em>me</em> then?\r\n\r\nBy sponsoring us FontShop supports a free and extremely
    valuable service that reaches well beyond the typographic community, so I think
    it's only fair that we return the favour in kind. Furthermore the people posting
    requests still have the freedom to purchase their type licenses elsewhere. It's
    not like we're pointing a gun to their heads or anything. Grow up, this is so
    sad."

    of monetary support or otherwise. The purpose of the forum is to provide help
    and options, and that''s what I try to do, regardless of my employment. FontShop
    links include custom sample strings without a watermark, so I hope they are of
    some use to the original poster. '
