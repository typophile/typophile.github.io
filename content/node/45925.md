body: "Sorry for the unoriginal title.  :(  I'm looking for the name of this one font
  - it's frustrating because I actually used to have it, until my computer's hard
  drive went kaput (note to self: BACKUPS) and now I can't remember what on earth
  it was called.  I want to say it started with a \"B\", but after browsing myfonts.com
  in the \"B\" category I didn't see it.  I might be thinking of another font though.
  \ \r\n\r\nAnyways, it was used as the price font (that indicated question dollar
  amounts) on \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\" (it's not Copperplate Gothic, trust
  me) and it's used in the screenshot below of a sign on James Cameron's Titanic set.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, and sorry for the poor quality / small screenshots.  You can see the
  lettering, mostly the distinctive \"E\", in the Titanic set shot, as well as where
  it says \"LIFELINES\" in the Millionaire screenie.\r\n\r\nThank you! :D\r\n\r\nTitanic:

  body: "Thanks Mike, that's the one!\r\n\r\nI realized that the \"B\" font I was
    thinking of was Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk - don't know why I got the two confused,
    but at least problem solved.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
