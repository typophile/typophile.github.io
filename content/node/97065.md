  ) to know what is your favorite letter. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F691weEVpwc
  \r\nThere is another thing towards the end of the video where Mr. Spiekermann criticizes
  Microsoft a lot. He goes to say that Microsoft is a company with bad tatse and stingy(
  since they didn't want to pay Linotype their license). He also says they commissioned
  Segoe to look like Frutiger and Arial to look  like Helvetica.\r\nI think  Microsoft
  does a lot in the field of Typography(OpenType and VOLT). I also personally like
  Segoe UI more than Frutiger.\r\nDo you think Mr. Spiekermann is right here?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nT"

    Arial does have its good points. It's less strongly oriented to display use than
    Helvetica - so it can also be used in place of Univers. So they got greater versatility
    in return for licensing only one typeface from Monotype instead of two from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    they <em>needed</em> to license Times Roman, and <em>that's</em> a Monotype typeface
    - so maybe their reason was wanting to deal with only one vendor. You get discounts
    that way."

    Helvetica and, most controversially, Book Antiqua instead of Palatino. Microsoft's
    relationship with Monotype was very close: Monotype personnel were stationed at
    Microsoft's Redmond headquarters, mostly doing TT hinting.\r\n\r\nLater, MS licensed
    Palatino Linotype -- in part, I believe, to try to right the wrong --, but for
    backwards compatibility reasons decided that they couldn't ditch Book Antiqua.
    So Windows now ships with both font families.\r\n\r\nSegoe... well, that's a later
    and still controversial development, but I don't think it can be ascribed to not
    wanting to pay the license fee for Frutiger <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger#Frutiger_Linotype\">because

    engine, so it effectively shields you from 'local' OS oddities.\r\nAs a consequence,
    one of the things that can go wrong with this workflow is Apple's proprietary
    changes to perfectly good fonts.\r\nFor one, it has been <a href=\"http://forums.adobe.com/message/4320355\">noted
    on the Adobe InDesign forum</a> that Apple's version of Baskerville has such weird
    hinting that Adobe's rendering actually makes it worse to read, rather than the
    perfectly good job they pull off with your average font.\r\nThe system font \"Helvetica
    Neue\" is so messed up that it has been <a href=\"http://www.fontgeek.net/blog/?p=253\">advised
    to entirely avoid it</a> (even if you can get it to work, sometimes you get pretty
    weird results when trying to embed it into a PDF).\r\nTheir private implementation
    of embedding color bitmaps into the Apple Emoji font is exactly that: private,
    undocumented, and not supported by any other software than Apple's (see <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/96671\">Unicode
    Definition For Dummies? Also: pixel precision</a> for a full discussion).\r\nLikewise,
    Apple's Advanced Typographic options are only available in Apple's own software;
    <a href=\"http://forums.adobe.com/thread/1079342\">InDesign cannot access them</a>.\r\n\r\nCompare
    this with Microsoft's continuous updating of Uniscribe (their OpenType interpreter),
    to such a point that Word, lousy as it may be, effortlessly displays complex interacting
    glyphs where InDesign, Adobe's \"flagship of typography\" fails miserably."

    of Linotype at the time, and was a good friend, as were many of the people involved
    in the project on the Microsoft side (Geraldine Wade, Mike Duggan, Greg Hitchcock).
    Bruno had hoped that Palatino Linotype would replace Book Antiqua, in Windows
    and Office, but because of existing user documents set in Book Antiqua and the
    lack of metrics compatibility between the two fonts, Microsoft decided that it
    could not remove support for that font. But at least, through the Palatino Linotype
    project, Hermann Zapf and Linotype received money from Microsoft for the licensing
    of the legitimate type.

  body: "I've since learned that Arial was based on Monotype Grotesque, and its significance
    was that it had the same metrics as Helvetica. Back in the old days, when the
    HP LaserJet was the standard for laser printing, one had to buy fonts for one's
    laser printer as well as for one's computer, since the connection between the
    computer and the laser printer had enough bandwidth to send the characters you
    were printing to the laser printer... not the raster of the page to be printed.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, this also followed the precedent of impact printers (daisywheel printers
    and various kinds of line printers such as band printers, chain printers, and
    drum printers) and dot matrix printers.\r\n\r\nI see from Wikipedia, however,
    that Arial was indeed not commissioned by Microsoft as a display font corresponding
    to Helvetica. Instead, it started out as Sonoran Sans Serif on the IBM 3800 high-volume
    laser printer. In IBM's case, the reason the metrics were matched with those of
    Helvetica was that Helvetica was licensed for a higher-resolution laser printer
    also manufactured by IBM (600 dpi as against 240 dpi)."

    supplied with Office since version 4.3 (1994). I also find the default line spacing
    of Palatino Linotype too wide. A lot of organisations prescribe Book Antiqua to
    be used for documents. So there are millions of documents set in Book Antiqua.
    That explains why Microsoft could not remove it back in 2000 and replace it with
    Palatino Linotype. They certainly could not remove it today, since the amount
    of documents in Book Antiqua has been growing ever since.\r\n\r\nDid you know
    there exists a Book Antiqua Parliamentary? It is being used by the British Parliament.
    I found this explanation from a House of Commons official:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We
    understand that Book Antiqua is published by Monotype and made available under
    license by Microsoft in some of their software packages. We can confirm that the
    Book Antiqua Parliamentary font is the same as standard Book Antiqua apart from
    the use of curved as opposed to straight quotation marks. You might also like
    to know that there are Book Antiqua Parliamentary 2 and Book Antiqua Parliamentary
    3 fonts which handle Welsh characters (circumflex and caret (to bach))and a Parliamentary
    Symbols font that has a star, diamond and hollow star which can appear in Papers
    relating to Bills.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo we can conclude that Book Antiqua is
    here to stay."
