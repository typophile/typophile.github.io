body: I&#39;m killing myself trying to remember the name of a font. It&#39;s a slab
  serif, fairly squat and extended face that I have most often seen used for the word
  &#34;stereo&#34; on album covers from the 50s or 60s. <BR> <BR>You can picture it,
  can&#39;t you? But where can I find it? <BR> <BR>Thanks.
