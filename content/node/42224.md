body: "Hi everyone,\r\nI'm looking for the name of this font. I thought it was Coop
  Bold by House industries, but, comparing the two typefaces, I noticed that in fact
  they are not so similar (Coop has something like serifs in certain gliphs, meanwhile
  this one has no serif at all).\r\nHope someone can help.\r\nBye!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_sample_4808.jpg]"
