body: "I am working on a project about the typeface Garamond.  It's history, different,
  versions, and uses today.  I was wondering if any one has good examples of products,
  companies, or anything else that used any version of Garamond both contemporary
  and all the way back through history to its orgin with Claude Garamond/Jean Jannon.
  \ Specific examples of Adobe Garamond in use today would be really helpful as well.\r\n\r\nAlso
  any good books/sites people know about for information about Claude Garamond or
  any versions of Garamond would be awesome.  Thanks for the help.\r\n"

    at the end.\r\n\r\nNow, what exactly are you looking for as an information about
    garamont? i have a lot of info and docs, but at first let me know what you already
    know.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "Alright.  I will look into more information for Garamont.  The information
    I have now is a pretty complete biography for Garamond himself, a few examples
    of his work, characteristics of the typeface, and some other various information
    about the face.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I am specifically looking for now is relatively
    high quality images (just higher than on screen) of work that used Garamond's
    typefaces back in the 16th-18th century when his typefaces were really popular
    in Europe.  Modern examples (like Apple or Abercombie's use of Garamond) are also
    needed.\r\n\r\nReally I will take any information you have and then I can go through
    it and just ignore any information that I happen to already have"

  body: "ITC Garamond was really hot for identities in the 1990s, you can find plenty
    of old images of Apple stuff that used it in old design annuals. \r\n\r\nOSHA
    uses Sabon in it\u2019s identity. I know this because the people behind that awful
    identity did a book about their identity programs, and made a big point out of
    switching OSHA from ITC Garamond to Sabon. It\u2019s sort of good for a laugh,
    I guess."

  body: Nobody's done more productive research on the work of Jannon in the "Garamond"
    tradition than Storm Foundry, as seen in their Jannon variations, from the most
    antique to the carefully adapted moderne for today's book text. Take a look. The
    MyFonts samples have meaty explanatory text.
