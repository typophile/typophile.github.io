  body: Sadly enough, your sample doesnt seem to work, or show up.. <i>&#40; If you
    created this in PhotoShop, could you maybe export / save a RGB .jpg / or .gif
    version of it and repost that sample, in here.? &#41;</i>

  body: Patty, I agree that Lucia is the closest font I can find. Whatever differences
    there are are very minor &#40;like the upper flare on the N, or the tail of the
    2&#41;. I&#39;d guess &#39;Lucia&#39; is Bitstream&#39;s digitization of an engraving
    type, or metal type, and so the variations we see were changes introduced in the
    digital version. That makes me suspect that the source of the image is a scan
    from a stationer&#39;s invitation. <BR> <BR>I have repeatedly found that stationers
    who offer real engraving also use engraving plates, or other type sources that
    don&#39;t exist in digital form &#40;I get often get ID requests from people who
    want to do-it-yourself and save money on invitations, but they are trying to match
    non-digital typefaces&#41;.

    target="_blank">Lucia test Drive</a> with these words.   <BR> <BR>It is not identical,
    as I noted, but I don&#39;t know of anything closer to the sample than this.

  body: The main difference I see is the x-height, it&#39;s much smaller in the sample
    than in Lucia. But you get the same feel nevertheless. <BR> <BR>Dav - I like your
    little wysiwyg instruction!

  body: The x-height is the sort of thing they might have wanted to change when it
    was digitized. <BR> <BR>Notice the MyFonts background info on the font? &#34;A
    light roundhand with mildly clubbed terminals on the capitals. It was expertly
    transferred from an engravers
