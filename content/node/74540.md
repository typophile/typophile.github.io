  tips are mainly for wooden letters.  If I was painting cabinets or other furniture
  made out of MDF I would use a different technique and supplies.\r\n\r\nSome sites
  recommend using oil based primer and paints for MDF but since these are going in
  a nursery I like to use acrylic craft paint, you can find this at your local craft
  store.\r\n\r\n1.  Sanding.  Our wooden wall letters are lightly sanded when we ship
  them to you.  If you would like very smooth edges, or in case i missed a spot,  you
  can sand the letters with 150 grit sand paper.  The top of the letters are very
  smooth so you can skip this area.  When you have finished sanding remove the dust
  with a rag, do not use a damp rag, mdf and water does not mix.\r\n\r\n2.  Primer.
  \ Some people will add a coat of primer to their letters before painting.  This
  step is optional, my wife gets very good results without adding primer but it takes
  more coats of paint.  I have had good results using a sealer, I found it with the
  craft paints at our local craft store.  After applying the primer or sealer you
  will  want to lightly sand with 220 grit sandpaper.  Again clean the dust off of
  the letters before proceeding.\r\n\r\n3.  Paint.  To get a nice finish use a foam
  brush or foam roller.  This will eliminate any brush strokes from showing up in
  your paint.  I personally like to use the foam roller, I believe its about 3-4 inches
  wide.  You can find these at you local hardware or craft store.  If you skipped
  the primer/sealer step above you may need to apply extra coats, the edges soak up
  a lot of paint.\r\n\r\n4.  Gloss.  Non-glossy paint seems to adhere better to itself
  when applying multiple coats but if you want a glossy finish you can apply a clear
  gloss to your painted letters.\r\n\r\nHope these tips help you when you are painting
