body: I saved this as "western", but it isn't western; nor circus.  The program I
  created this file in does not identify the font I used.  Need the exact font if
  possible.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/resizelove_4305.jpg]

  body: "One name for this general style is 'Tuscan', but my search of the Tuscan
    styles at MyFonts didn't come up with anything that came even close to this O.
    This seems rather crudely shaped, and I thought it might be fill letters to go
    with a fancier overlaid set of letters.\r\n\r\nYou sure this isn't hand-drawn,
    and not a font?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Ok, I'm not talented enough to hand draw something like this. LOL  The only
    thing I can think of is that someone else drew it and sent it to me.  So you could
    be right.  It does look pretty crude, doesn't it.  I used it in a cutting program
    and looks good when cut.  \r\nThanks."

  body: It has a feel like <a href="http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/3983?text=carbon%20offsets">Wild
    West Shadow</a> but not exact. It's my guess this is a custom job. Do you need
    just these letters or are you after the an entire alphabet?
