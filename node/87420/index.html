  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The OERT project is offering expert type design review service for US$100+ as part of its fund raising efforts to publish some great educational resources for type designers :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosgaya/oert-open-educational-resources-for-typography">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosgaya/oert-open-educational-resources-for-typography</a></p>
<!--break-->
<p>Here&rsquo;s the description:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project aims to make high quality learning resources on typography and type design available to every student in the world.  The resources will be completely free and open, like Wikipedia.</p>
<p>[VIDEO]</p>
<p>We are teachers of typography at FADU/UBA, the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism from University of Buenos Aires. This is a free public university, one of the most important universities in Argentina and it has the largest number of students. This year is UBAs 190th anniversary.</p>
<p>Since the Graphic Design degree began here, Typography has been considered one of the most important subjects of the curriculum. We belong to Cátedra Cosgaya, a teaching team that delivers typography lessons to over 500 students each year.</p>
<p>To deliver the course, we have been developing and refining booklets to support our curriculum since 1994. We are seeking funding and support to pay for our expert tutors to spend time away from their freelance design practice and update these booklets so that they stand on their own, no longer tied directly to our teaching programme.</p>
<p>After thoroughly updating  them, we will professionally translate the resources from Spanish into English. We will bring this knowledge to the web under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license so it can be further translated.</p>
<p>The booklets are currently organized into three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theory</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Practical exercises</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to work on each section under a specific Kickstarter project. This is the first, for producing the Theory of Typography. We plan to run two more Kickstarter projects, so that we can learn about the Kickstarter model as we go.</p>
<p>If you love typography and would like more people to understand why typography and type design is important, and how to do it well, please support our project!</p>
<p>Part 1: Theory</p>
<p>[VIDEO]</p>
<p>The first part of the project provides a theoretical framework to understand the attributes of a font family and introduce the skills involved in typeface design: what ‘structure,’ ‘stroke’ and ‘counter’ mean in this field, what kerning and tracking are all about, how to deal with details and serifs. It also describes how fonts can be used appropriately with a repertoire of approaches to typography for different sorts of publications, from music CD inserts to books, newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>Open Educational Resources for Typography will launch in late December 2011. It will be edited, enhanced and improved with the input and assistance of anyone who is interested. We hope your collaboration will help us move the world’s typography forward!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>(Please note that this project’s funds will be paid to the TeX Users Group (<a href="mailto:office@tug.org">office@tug.org</a>), a USA-based 501(c)3 non-profit organization that is kindly running a ‘Libre Font Fund.' This enables us to receive the funds in Argentina, since Amazon Payments will not usually work outside the USA.)</p>

<p>I think some clarifications would help the effort. (Plus I&rsquo;m confused, as usual.)</p>
<p>Who, exactly, is the &ldquo;we&rdquo; who will be reviewing the fonts and doing all this stuff? Who are the &ldquo;experts&rdquo;?
It&rsquo;s not exactly clear.</p>
<p>Will the educational stuff be in English? Or Spanish? Will they be created in Spanish with an English translation necessary?
(Sorry, I wish I spoke Spanish, but I don&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi, Richard. Thank you for your interest in the project OERT and your questions.</p>
<p>We (Marcela Romero, Natalia Pano and I, who are promoting this initiative) have convened to work with us to young typeface design graduates and digital foundries members. Also, we will provide them a form of analysis for the work easier. We will soon to announce their names.</p>
<p>The project originates from the collection of typography booklets distributed (in Spanish) among students of the [[http://www.catedracosgaya.com.ar|chair of typography]] which I coordinate at the University of Buenos Aires. These booklets contain an introduction to typeface design and design criteria for the use of fonts on publishing projects (newspapers, magazines, books).</p>
<p>The project is intended to edit the content and translate it into English. Since then, may be enriched with the contribution of the whole type-community, which you can access it as free.</p>
<p>I wish I write and spoke English, but I can only do so thanks to Google Translate ;-)</p>
<p>I remain at your disposal for any further questions.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Gracias por responder.</p>
<p>Dos de mis amigos más antiguos y queridos, el Dr. Carlos Zigel, y de renombre mundial percusionista Norberto Goldberg son ambos de Argentina.</p>
<p>La razón por la que pidió es que la gente podría enviar más dinero si están seguros de que obtendrá algo valioso por sí mismos.</p>
<p>Le deseo suerte.</p>

<p>English:</p>
<p>Thank you for answering.
Two of my oldest and dearest friends, Dr. Carlos Zigel, and world-reknowned percussionist Norberto Goldberg are both from Argentina.
The reason I asked is that people might send more money if they are sure they will get something valuable for themselves.</p>
<p>I wish you luck.</p>
