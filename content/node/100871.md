body: "I'm currently wondering how Google manages to make Roboto look pretty much
  exactly the same on different browsers. If you're wondering, have a look at it in
  Firefox, and then a webkit browser like Chrome:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com/nexus/4/\r\n\r\nNow,
  here's a comparison to what it looks like on a test page I've set up:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web-font-differences_4183.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  rendering in Safari makes the font unusable. So the question is:\r\n\r\n<strong>How
  does Google do it?</strong> It seems like I'm missing something? At first I thought
  they might be serving different fonts, but I've checked, and they are identical.
  I feel like I'm missing something?\r\n\r\nAny insights are greatly appreciated!"

    layout with that image, I didn't check and thought it was <600px wide.\r\n\r\n<strong>Problem
    solved:</strong> I just realized that a webkit style was disabling subpixel antialiasing,
    which made the fonts appear much thinner compared to how they were rendered with
    subpixel antialiasing in non-webkit browser."

    body: Yes, thanks, I've figured it out. It was just unfortunate that I couldn't
      edit the image that breaks the layout.
