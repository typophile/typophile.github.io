    put 'media' inside the extra fat J. The J could have texture/s.\r\n\r\nWhat is
    this going to be? A blog about media? "

      some personal projects that i would like to display as a digital media/art collection.
      Breaking the daily commercial thinking with a hidden abstract thounghtstring.
      That in it's turn would help me out on a professional level and in a way it
      would build my confident to advice clients and to pursuade them into \"going
      off the path\" designs.\r\nUsing all media as i daily get soked with it ;)\r\n\r\nWhat
      do you think about the J in number 8, it feels a little small."

  body: "I agree the j seems small in 8. Junk is ther Key Idea - no? Which is why
    I was wondering about a bigger j. I also thought of another idea. \r\n\r\nWhat
    if you had a railroad spike & then bent the end to make a J? A spike is of course
    slang for the needle so it would be less direct but still connected. And you wouldn't
    need the needle then either... Also a bent spike is junk in some sense -litterally.
    Because it's useless - unless you use it as a J in a bit of media...\r\n\r\nAnyway.
    I encourage you to keep playing with it until you get a set of size & spacing
    relationships that gel for you. 8 Is good as a purely visual design but I think
    it deemphasizes the key idea so you should keep going."

  body: "I agree with everyone that #8 is the strongest design. The only thing bugging
    me is that the J is set using a serif font while everything else is sans. Is there
    a particular reason for doing that or is does it appear like that purely because
    of the distressed effect?\r\n\r\nAs an aside I also like #6 but it's offputing
    because the \"junk\" has slid right off the boundary of the logo. While I do appreciate
    the metaphor that the junk is being sort of disposed of you do not need to overstate
    this. Just by setting the text in a grungy distressed type you have established
    its feel. Try #6 with the \"junk\" text aligned similarly to #8 and let's see
    how that looks.\r\n\r\n-mmilo\r\n\r\n"

    how the junk text looks splattered on. Actually I pretty much like all of these
    latest ones they all have their nice qualities, but my personal favourite is 11.
    The only thing I could suggest is to perhaps consider different colours and see
    how those look.'

    remember once searching for it and noticing there are a few \"media junkie\" and
    \"media junk\" sites, so i was confused trying to find his. \r\n\r\nbut it's probably
    ok to have more than one. and you are probably very different types of projects/ideas...
    i'm sure you had considered this just thought i'd mention it in case you hadn't."

    Personally I like all of the duotone ones, 13, 14, 16 and 17; I think they all
    work really well. Nice work buddha I really like how it's turned out, let's see

  body: I like it knocked out of the black rectangle because it really jumps out at
    you but it's not smart to put it in a shape like that for no reason. I like 16
    and 17 the best other than that.

    body: yep, i put in the white logo to see it as a mono-color print. For stickers
      or other print material in mono color. I'm pretty new in creating logo's but
      i always keep in mind that it hase to be in vectors and i can be used in the
      worst possible print conditions(mono-color for instance). That way you don't
      run into to many problems in the end(print/web).

  body: I like the new stuff too. I think 10 might be stronger but it's a question
    of preferred association too. 10 reads as 'junk=drugs'. But 11 reads m ore as
    'trash' to me. I have no idea if reads that way to you too or which association
    you want to play with more or why. In any case I agree with Lauri ( antiphrasis
    ) that the J should be bigger.In a way it's the hook bothe letterally ( it's hook
    shaped ) and figuratively - because it's first letter in the the odd/interesting
    word. I think making more of it would jive you a stronger result. And lastly,
    I don't know that you need to enhance the M in media with the color of the J.  I
    like having just the J be in color. Making all the spotches & scratches be colored
    too might be cool.
