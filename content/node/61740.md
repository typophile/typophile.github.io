    describe the font. The ''Q'' is what had me confused in locating the font. Will
    check to see if I have Avant Garde. But thank you. '

    done (would mentioning \"Bowen Associates\" really help?) or how useful it can
    be (do people often choose what to id based on the... genre?). And Craig did put
    one very important piece of information: that it was urgent.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    somewhere in my travels, I'll come back to ID it. So maybe \"Use a descriptive
    title if it's not a common or easy to identify font\" would be better.\r\n\r\n
