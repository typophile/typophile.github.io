    location, location of course. Photos of the area, maps, competitor's names, photos
    of the apartments, their interiors, background on the company developing the project,
    the architect, the climate, etc.\r\n\r\nthat said, I find it odd that there's
    an Name This Apartment Complex in Mexico thread at Typophile. \r\nAnd I wonder
    whether you have attempted to do this work yourself. Are you getting paid for
    this work?\r\n\r\nnot trying to be harsh, really, I'm just curious. :D\r\n\r\nhere
    are some starting points:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wordcraft-Turning-Little-Words-Business/dp/1400051045\">Wordcraft:
