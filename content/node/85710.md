  empty components. nbspace->(space).\"\r\n\r\nFrom this I take it that it is saying
  that there is something wrong with my nbspace glyph, and also my space glyph? It's
  calling them composities? But they're blank!\r\n\r\nCan anyone wager a guess as
  to what this could be about? Thanx!"

  body: My guess is that you created /nbspace/ as a composite of /space/, rather than
    simply copying the glyph. I'm not sure whether there is anything technically wrong
    with a non-outline composite, but the easy solution is to replace the /nbspace/
    glyph with a simple copy of the /space/ glyph or just decompose the composite.
