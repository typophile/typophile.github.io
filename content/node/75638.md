    is right</a>. Otherwise I like it very much. Well edited\_\u2014 most of the entries
    are interesting. On the auto tip, here is a collection of <a href=\"http://chromeography.com/\">chrome
    lettering</a> organized by <a href=\"http://chromeography.com/tagged/script\">tag</a>."

  body: "Hi Richard, great you made it to Typophile, welcome!\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll repeat
    <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/hardwig/status/18225869166\">what I\u2019ve said
    on Twitter</a> recently:\r\n\r\nGreat site indeed. Although I wish you would put
    these pics on Flickr* [or introduce a comment/tag functionality on your site]\u2014without
    tags &c, it\u2019s just a big album, not a resource, nor a community. And <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/hardwig/status/18227053353\">yes</a>,
    I would like to add tags myself.\r\n\r\n*) What I like about Flickr is the fact
    that it is modular. You can add your photos to one or more groups. There are several
    places for signage, lettering etc., e.g. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/signpaintr/\">Signpaintr</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/typewalk/\">Typewalk</a>.\r\n\r\nSome
    groups focus on a subtopic, like <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/neonsigns\">neon
    signs</a> or <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/355438@N24/\">vintage motel
    signs</a>. Others collect examples for an even narrower field of interest: there
    are groups for single characters like the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/ij/\">Dutch
    \u0132/\u0133</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/386230@N21/\">German
    capital Eszett</a>.\r\n\r\nI know that Flickr has its downsides aswell (proprietary/Pro
    usage not free, among others).\r\nAnd: we would need to develop a useful and commonly
    agreed upon terminology.\r\n\r\nThis project looks promising, but hasn\u2019t
    quite started yet: http://colettering.com/\r\n\r\nMore related sites:\r\nhttp://www.publiclettering.org.uk/\r\nhttp://www.stadtgespraeche.com/\r\nhttp://www.vernacular.fr/\r\n\r\nFlorian\r\n"

  body: "<cite>\u2026 without tags &c, it\u2019s just a big album, not a resource,
    nor a community.</cite>\r\n\r\nYou have a point here. When a larger stock of photos
    becomes searchable, that is much more interesting than having just a bunch of
    images, however beautiful they might be. Considering that, Colettering.com looks
    quite promising, and yet I wonder if contributors will be able there to establish
    their own categories (\u201Dbeer labels\u201D) instead of being restricted by
    the default set of tags.\r\n\r\nFlickr may be a suitable platform to let typophile
    photo collections grow. But: a group \u201Ctypography and lettering\u201D comprising
    more than 86.000 pieces seems rather useless to me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I find
    also [[http://www.flickr.com/groups/blackboardlettering/pool/|this collection
    of blackboard lettering]] quite enchanting.\r\n"

  body: Colettering project looks great, love the interface & functionality... I am
    somewhat limited w/ using indexhibit, and not being able to write code, i wish
    i could find a programmer out there that was into typography - sorry sticklers
    "lettering" and wanted to help build TA properly... until then i'll just keep
    the images coming...

  body: "Hi,\r\nThank you for your interest in [[http://www.colettering.com|Colettering]].\r\nBefore
    we started our colettering project we looked for similar projects or alternatives.\r\nWe
    then decided to create something new, because we haven't found a project with
    our key properties.\r\n\r\nsome are:\r\n- not another photoblog\r\n- standardized
    tagging for the specifications (no duplicates \"sans-serif\", \"sans serif\")\r\n-
    additional (free) tagging (add color, factory ore something like that)\r\n- geolocation\r\n-
    all properties are searchable and can be combined (specification, character, location)\r\n-
    beautiful and simple interface :)\r\n\r\nDuring the last few weeks I've fixed
    the most tasks and bugs on our roadmap, \r\nso I am very confident to start soon
    with the beta version.\r\n\r\nJ\xF6rn"
