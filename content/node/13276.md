    care of the PR and Communication send me Univers as being the font that is in
    use at Hollywood for all the informations that are used in the bottom of the poster.
    So, try Univers (the condensed and compressed versions)."

    target="new">Univers Ultra Condensed</a>, which incidentally is the typeface you're

  body: Bee is URW's name for the old VGC "B" series. These were unnamed fonts that
    may go back further than Univers, and may have been knock-offs of Photo-Lettering
    faces. (Unfortunately, it's difficult to precisely date P-L faces, so I can't
    say for sure there was no Univers connection.) VGC had a whole series of fonts
    that only had a letter-number designation--no name--mostly casual scripts and
    such, but also sort of generic looking sans serifs, like the B series.

  body: "New information about the \"B\" fonts: They all originated at Filmotype in
    the 1950s. Each font had a different name that started with a G--Giant, Gaucho,
    Grant, Gazette, etc. VGC knocked these off in the 1960s (a common practice at
    the time) as the \"B\" fonts. In fact, most (if not all) of the unnamed fonts
    in VGC's catalog originated at Filmotype. P-L had similar fonts, but not quite
    the same design.\r\n\r\nFYI: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/29561\">The Filmotype
    library is being digitized.</a>\r\n\r\nEdit: I see that some similar information
    was provided in this thread: http://www.typophile.com/node/10616"
