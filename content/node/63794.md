  across a licensing question I'm finding difficult to answer.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes
  to publishing websites, printed work and commercial design projects in general,
  are there limitations on using the fonts that are included with the OS (Windows,
  OS X) and/or with software? (Adobe CS, Microsoft Office, etc.)\r\n\r\nBottom line,
  can I use them as freely as I would any font licensed directly from the foundry?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help."

  body: "Thanks SII. Very helpful =P\r\n\r\nDo you mean this?\r\n\r\nc. Font Components.
    While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content.\r\nYou
    may only\r\n\u2022 embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions
    in the fonts; and\r\n\u2022 temporarily download them to a printer or other output
    device to help print content.\r\n\r\nSo the answer to my question would be that
    the license in this instance does not extend to, for instance, creating a logo
    or originating any design work in a commercial environment using Calibri?\r\n\r\nFonts
    installed through the installation of Microsoft Office are not available to Adobe
    Illustrator/PhotoShop for instance?\r\n\r\nAm I over complicating things?"

  body: "Yes, that's the bit. It doesn't really speak to the creation of logos - however
    we've never had a problem with people making outlined logos using the fonts. It's
    such a fringe activity for 99.9999999% of our users that it's not called out in
    the license.\r\n\r\nOffice fonts are installed as system wide resources so can
    be used in the Adobe apps you mention.  which doesn't make a lot of sense. \r\n\r\nTypically
    we see graphic designers, especially those on the Mac picking up end user licenses
    for fonts like Calibri from Ascender, just to stay safe, and have licenses that
    are more like typical font EULAs.   \r\n"
