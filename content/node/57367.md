  body: "I'd say it's especially nice to use small caps in blocks of text where there
    are a lot of abbreviations or acronyms. Ubiquitous full caps make the text very
    difficult to read. \r\n\r\nI have to use lots of acronyms in blocks of text and
    actually full caps look too clunky and I find small caps a bit pretentious. So
    I tend to use full caps but reduced a point size and bumped up from regular to
    medium to get the weight right. I think Bringhurst had the same idea. \r\n\r\nIt
    depends on how much you need abbreviations and how they look on the page I think."

  body: "I need the abbr., but they don't show up that often.\r\n\r\nAnother issue:
    The small cap height in my body text (Bembo Book) is a bit short, IMO. It's not
    all that obvious that they are supposed to be caps. They look more like lowercase,
    especially with a word like \"USA\" that has such similar shapes in both lc and
    uc."

    caps or not? Or maybe I should go italic on it. The downside is that it'll kill
    the comic book flavour."

  body: "Using small caps isn't a rule, it is a generalization. Their use should depend
    on context, even in text. The decision about when to use them is all to often
    not left to the comp, but to some unseen, unknown editor, who is not happy with
    anything not covered by a hard and fast rule.\r\n\r\nFor example, I did a book
    recently where small caps were specified for acronyms/abbreviations, but ultimately,
    use was my choice. One of them was GI, as in the GI's retuning from World War
    II. The most common occurrence of GI was \"the GI Bill\". Well, \"Bill\" always
    has an initial cap, so setting \"GI\" in small caps in this context would look
    passing odd. I wound up setting all occurrences of \"GI\" as full caps, primarily
    because of the \"GI Bill\" and because \"GI\" is only two letters long. Personally,
    at 3+ letters, I'd have no problem using small caps in some constructions, and
    full caps in others. Just like using old-style figures with U&lc text, but lining
    with full caps.\r\n\r\nUnless an editor throws a fit, I always set abbreviations/acronyms
    in subheads in full caps, esp. when the subhead style is to cap the first letter
    of each word (general style is usually an editor's choice).\r\n\r\nIn your example
    of \"BAAM,\" I'd set it full caps. As you say, it is suppose to be emphasized.\r\n\r\nAs
    for small caps that are a bit small, if you're using InDesign, you can search
    for all of them & bump the point size a point or so. You can also letterspace
    them with such a global search.\r\n\r\nBumping up small caps is better than setting
    full caps smaller IMHO. When you set a letter smaller, it also has less weight.
    Unless you're using a font where the caps are a bit heavy to start with, I find
    lighter \"smallish caps\" unattractive.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
