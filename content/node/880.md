  body: I would try making the type fully saturated or opaque except where you have
    the hightlight. Maybe take number 2 and saturate the parts of the type that aren&#39;t
    below a hightlight. Right now it&#39;s either full opacity or half. Hope this
    makes sense.

    ! from 6, I think that would be great.

    the same blue as the H2Oh!. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: I think the drop shadows and keylines are too heavy/solid - the bottom right
    versions &#40;your last post&#41; work better. ignacio&#39;s simplified suggestion
    is nice &#40;some of your sketches are a little busy i think&#41;. <BR>the exclamation
    point is begging to be used as a highlight in my opinion, have you tried reversing
    the text out of a blue bubble?

  body: Joe I tried your reversing idea, good idea but - not really working. I know
    what you mean with the exclamation point - that was my intent...same with using
    the counter of the O.  <BR> <BR>Mike - I&#39;m glad someone mentioned it &#40;
    the O as distracting&#41; - it was kind&#39;a bothering me, the shape even too,
    but I thought maybe it was just me from starring at it too long. I reworked the
    O now so that its more subtle. highlight over the counter instead. I think that
    was probably the big wrong looking thing. <BR> <BR>So I think I&#39;m about finished,
    here it is.  I figure adding a few smaller plain drops helps clarify &amp; funkify.  <BR>
    <BR>Designing in a vacuum sucks sometimes, so thanks for the second pair of eyes.  <BR>

  body: Its a bit confusing to explain <BR> <BR>H2Oh! is a WaterCan initiative &#40;a
    Canadian NGO that deals with water issues in dev. countries and Canada&#41; Its
    a program that will be introduced into the Canadian High School cirriculum. Its
    goal is to create a learning series and offer lesson plans &#40;modules&#41; that
    can be incorporated, modified and tailored by teachers into the science stream.
    The program is being developed by a committee of teachers and distributed via
    official channels &#40;school board cirriculum officers&#41; for review at this
    point. But the hopes for phase 2, 3 and beyond are that teachers themselves will
    find it and ask for it to be incorporated. Further still, they hope that parents
    and even students will seek and get involved.  <BR> <BR>Its sort of like taking
    First Aid  &#40;St. John&#39;s Ambulance&#41;, or Jump Rope for Heart that kids
    take in phys ed. &#40;Heart and Stroke Foundation&#41; that students take in school.
    Except this is for the science courses and the topic is water produced by WaterCan.

    Is this thing got anything to do with the UN year of fresh water? i am  working

    sure that Canada at least does its part to help make the UN 2015 goal &#40;the
    promise about raising to half the population who have access to safe drinking
    water&#41;  <BR> <BR>WaterCan is the only NGO in Canada that deals with water
    issues as such with the UN, then there&#39;s Water For People in the US and WaterAid
    in the UK. Does New Zealand have one that your hooking up with?

  body: This looks really wonderful Tanya. Congratulations.  <BR> <BR>I really like
    it with the byline. I think the very last one has the advantage. If you have the
    time, dedication or budget, could you make the byline a bit more custom? The EA
    touching is great. Could you extend the E into the R on &#34;series?&#34;  Even
    as is, it is great. Just commenting.  <BR> <BR> The small bubbles on that last
    one are just right. The right size, the right place...  <BR> <BR>Love it , love
    it. I am glad you went with the double bowled O. This is good. <BR> <BR>S. <BR>

  body: Hey thanks alot guys. I do plan on tweaking it here and there - the byline
    and such...but gotta do that on my time now in secret-teeny updates that the committee
    hopefully won&#39;t notice as they&#39;ve approved moreso out of time/budget contraints.  <BR>
    <BR>Jacques I&#39;m interested in your comment but don&#39;t understand what you
    mean by mirroring? <BR> <BR>Ignacio, I know what you mean...but here check it
    out in context with the nav bar on the site &#40;general look and feel so far&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>As for the colour - I wanted to stick with WaterCan&#39;s own pantone
    so that it won&#39;t increase any print costs on collateral - I think it says
    a little something to do with sticking &#34;on brand&#34; so-to-speak <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    also allowed for some strange standards. Because I can&#39;t really target any
    one age group I suggested that in collateral appealing to older crowds - we place
    fewer decorative bubbles or even none so that it has more of a &#34;MTV&#34; feel.
    Younger crowds get more small bubbles - super young - lots! so you get the &#34;Nickelodeon&#34;
    idea. In essence the bubbles are going to help it scale up and down the targets
    - or something like that. haha <BR>
