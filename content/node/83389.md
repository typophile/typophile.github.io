    it in three weights. It is shown in the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg24.html\">Script

  body: "Hmm, my samples were from the days when they were free/shareware. The font
    was designed in 1992, according to the info in my Guide, so it's been out there
    a long time. \r\n\r\nThe samples were from a donor. So I didn't have the fonts
    myself.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
