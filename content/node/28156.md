  body: MigraHeavy is from FontBank, as is Periapt. - (No idea who that is or location)-
    BuyFonts.com is listed as a source on Google. The fonts are cheap and have very
    limited character sets. They sell for $2 each and in addition to limited character
    sets the quality is questionable. These fonts have also been sold by an outfit
    called TigerDirect as a 250 font CD in the past if I remember right.

    of course, I in no way condone doing this. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, a few of the other
    links on the page link to font collections that can be purchased that apparently
    contain the typeface in question."

    to delete it ... c'mon ... play nice.
