body: "This is a very quick and rough (very rough) draft of my typeface. I was just
  looking for feedback and everyones first impressions keep in mind this is my first
  typeface and I am relatively new to the process.  \r\n\r\nI have currently only
  done the lowercase just because I'm not 100% sure what direction I should be going
  in. I was going for an italic serif loosely based off of Bodoni and I tried to go
  with the Old style/ Transitional style. \r\n\r\nFirst impression, critique, technical
  aspects any comment will be helpful thank you. \r\n\r\nI'm really having trouble
  with c/e/f/y/k/s/ but of course I will take any advice on all or any of the letters. "

  body: "Let's address first the salient feature of the face, the square ball terminals,
    or block terminals I guess. I feel they fall between two preferable treatments:
    Either the stroke should be narrower where it meets the block, the inner curve
    being about halfway across, or the inner curve should turn all the way to meet
    the corner.\r\n\r\nThe thins are extremely thin, and I would expect them to agree
    more with the weight of the serifs and crossbars."

  body: "I agree on the weight of the thins, I'm going in and adding some thickness.
    \r\nI've been doing a lot of readings on the technical aspects of certain characters,\r\nbut
    there is little information out there on italic serif. Do you know how to properly
    make an italic /o/? \r\nIt seems like theres more to it then rotating it and tweeking
    the counter. "

    guarantee you that I am more of a noob than you, but I'll offer my comments anyway...
    just take them with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nI do like the idea for the terminals,
    but I do think they could use some minor tweaking. I agree with cerulean's comments,
    but between the two options mentioned, I kind of prefer the former. I think you've
    just about nailed it with the terminal on the /r/. In my opinion, the curve appears
    to be sufficiently thin and at the correct angle as it meets the terminal. The
    /f/, /c/, etc. appear to be somewhat undecided....\r\n\r\nDo you plan on making
    a Roman for this, or will it be strictly Italics?\r\n\r\nKeep it up!"
