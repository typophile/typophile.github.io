  the life of me I can't remember the name of the font/typeface and since I've upgraded
  computers I don't have my all of my font files handy.\r\n\r\nPlease if someone could
  identify the typeface used here for the logo 'Bananaz' and the various quotes, I'd
  really appreciate it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bananaz-font_3811.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLuke"
