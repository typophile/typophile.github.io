body: Mike Parker related this story from the early days Helvetica. A sales rep contacted
  him and says that forever they have been asked to push Trade Gothic, and now wants
  to know what is this Helvertical. Mike Parker replies, "you've got it all wrong,
  it's Horizontica."

  body: He told me the same story a year or two ago. He lived at the same old folks
    home as my grandmother, and I got to chat with him a couple of time. Quite a character!
