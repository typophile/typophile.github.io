  body: The agency I used to work for did the Halo 2 print campaign and they used
    Handel Gothic. They may have changed it since then, that was several games ago.

  body: "Big deal man, who cares?\r\n\r\nJk, that helps a lot to get it from someone
    who actually worked with it, thank you Corey. I have Aero Plain in my suitcase
    and is almost a replica of Handel Gothic, so I may just use that and save some
    cash.\r\n\r\nLooks to be about a 75% vertical scale btw."
