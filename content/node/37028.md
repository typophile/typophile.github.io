  day. I have only got \r\nsome basic ideas here which are not quite working yet,
  but I would appreciate any feedback / ideas for further development.\r\n\r\nI am
  trying to portray the idea that poetry is boundless and that it can be expressed
  by anybody in a countless amount of ways. To show this I have been interpreting
  a piece of text in numerous ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks to work are below,\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j251/lamorch/main.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j251/lamorch/main3.jpg"

  body: Will you be employing color? I feel it needs a visual anchor, either color
    or a sense of scale will help.

  body: Colour is definately a component that will be incorporated into the design.
    The actual design however is not really working. My tutor thinks that I need to
    show the different ways poetry can be expressed, like email, performed, sung,
    written etc...

  body: 'It might also be useful to consider the ways that poetry is traditionally
    typeset, there are very distinct styles. However I guess ''poetry day'' is more
    about the public reading of poetry so I''d say that expressing the emotion and
    even verbal structure of poetry as it is read, through typographic expression,
    is a better fit for the project. '

    was sorry that none could come up with a \u2018randomiser\u2019, that you asked
    for earlier \u2013 that seemed an interesting approach.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Yeh I have moved on from the 'randomiser', the interpretation of poetry is
    not really a random process.

  body: Poetry is probably the opposite of random. At least, usually it is pretty
    well defined.
