body: I&#39;m making a profile for a company, and I&#39;m looking for a modern, dynamic
  yet professional sans-serif font to build the logo from.  <BR>I really like the
  Section typeface from Thirstype and Sansa by Fred Smeijers, but I need more alternatives.
  Do you know of any others maybe in the same &#34;direction&#34; as those mentioned?
