  author who is asking for this. My sense is that it's not a good idea, but I don't
  know why.\r\n\r\nI'm using Adobe Garamond 10/13.2 (poet/author wants slightly larger
  leading), and I do think Garamond sets small, but I think we should use either 10
  pt or 11 pt and not something strange like 10.6.\r\n\r\nAny advice is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nStephanie"

  body: In my opinion Adobe Garamond looks better at 11 than 10pt. I don't see anything
    wrong with decimal values for type sizes, but with leading anything less than
    0.5pt can be very impractical (Pardon my English, tonight I'm tired).

  body: "Darrell Huff (How to Lie with Statistics) would call this the \"spuriously
    precise figure\". I wonder if the author has seen this in another context, where
    perhaps the 10.6 figure was arrived at in a DTP setting because it suited that
    specific layout and those specific words.\r\n\r\nCould you set at 11 & let the
    author <em>think</em> it was 10.6? ;-)\r\n\r\nPaul\r\nUK"

    not to use odd point sizes.\r\nIf 11p looks too large and 10p too small, then
    go for it. Absolutely valid, with today\u2019s digital tools.\r\nF"

  body: "Stephanie,\r\n\r\nActually, it happens fairly often. If you're the designer/typesetter
    & text files have been supplied, you can fairly quickly set a lot of the text.
    Often, there will be a setting where things just work better -- say, for a particular
    text, 10.6/13 x 25.5 (or 25p6 in NEWSPEAK). I've been known to play with measure
    in 1/4 pica increments, and as your client suggests, type size in 10ths of a point.
    The optimal leading is also affected by the measure (well, margins) & type size.
    All this can lead to specifications not possible with old typesetting systems,
    even computer-based ones.\r\n\r\nWhen you get the *right* sizes, things just sort
    of click. The spacing looks right, you don't have too many widows, too many hyphens,
    etc. etc. Perhaps less an issue with poetry, though you still have the visuals
    of measure, margins, & turned lines to accommodate.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "Hi Jens,\r\n\r\n\"Would you argue that the difference between 10 and 11 pt
    and something in between can\u2019t be seen?\"\r\n\r\nAs a lay person I don't
    have the expertise to judge, but I am saying it's odd that the author (also one
    presumes not the layout expert) came upon such a figure, apparently in advance
    of trying 11. That's why I say \"spuriously precise\". \r\nFrom my lay perspective
    if I was the client I imagine I would say I wanted the work \"a bit bigger\",
    or with \"a bit more leading\", and let the designer decide an appropriate point
    size. \r\nIn comparison in my line of work as a pharmacist I will round up or
    down a dose derived by a doctor which is over-precise for no good reason in my
    professional opinion, or in practical terms is to a precision which is not measurable
    (e.g., give 4.8ml using a 5ml spoon).\r\n\r\nIn essence, 10.6 may be exactly right,
    but I would trust the professional's judgement to arrive at that.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPaul"

    \"\r\n\r\nWhen working with newspapers and other publications to define the perfect
    blend of size, leading and line length, we land on fractional point sizes all
    the time. \r\n\r\nWhen working with screen resolutions other than 72 and 144 dpi,
    operating systems and thus applications, automatically use fractional point sizes,
    almost exclusively. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
