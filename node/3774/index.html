  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hihi, I'm a graphic design student from Canada and I was wondering if anyone else had ever come accross with the problem of bilingual forms. <BR> <BR>Recently, for my typographic grid class my teacher assigned us with a very horrible looking form from a nearby university. Basically there are two copies of this form, one is in english and the other one in french. Our job is to redesign this form so that a) it's only one page and b) it's much more attractive than the previous one. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, forms already tend to be packed with lots of information so it's kinda hard to keep in legible and <b>bilingual</b> on one page &hellip; <BR> <BR>Any suggestions?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really don't see how Shannon is whining. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>I think there are two possible strategies: make the two languages visually as close as possible; or apply some cultural sensitivity and risk the wrath of the cross-eyed Modernists. <BR> <BR>The first option is pretty easy. But it might result in the functional quicksand like in Emil Ruder's monolithic (in contentually great) textbook. <BR> <BR>The second option might benefit from using totally different fonts for each language. Ladislas Mandel for example insists that French type needs to have a smaller x-height. This would actually help in the technical realm too, since French will generally run longer (like Nick says). You could also be more conservative and simply apply width (friendliness versus elegance) by using an MM font with a width axis, and making the French font slightly narrower, which would also help with balancing the space usage. Note however that smaller x-heights and narrowness will make the French have a smaller apparent size, and some people might interpret this as &quot;less important&quot; (although others might see it as &quot;discrete&quot;, which fortunately happens to be in cultural character). One thing you could do to counter this is put the French first, like on the left or on top. You could also use a bit more leading to make it seem &quot;larger&quot; in a different way. <BR> <BR>BTW, there are some great articles in old issues of the journal Visible Language about multilingual typography. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I do most of my publications English French, and in many case my English is more longer (Yes, I'm one of these bad translator to English, so more long). :-) <BR> <BR>A very recent example from this afternoon: I just edited the French texts of the Avenir Next specimen. Booth English and French came from German source. My job was to edit the French, as the original translation was bad (BabelFish have done perhaps better job than that one). <BR> <BR>The main conceptual text take 1642 signs in French, 1708 in English. English more longer! <BR> <BR>Each language has his owns habits don't try to make them identical, its a stupid 50's universal approach. <BR> <BR>Sometimes, one language will take more space than another for many reasons, subject, translation, style of the writer, sometimes its the reverse. Who know the truth?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although [literal] translation adds about 10-15%, some languages are still more verbose than others. English is generally very terse, while Latin languages (except Latin itself!) are more verbose. <BR> <BR>It's rare to find good benchmarks of language economy, but a handy one is Zhukov and Sadek's &quot;Typographia polyglotta&quot;, which shows official, very tight, but <i>non-literal</i> versions of the UN Charter in 20+ languages. It shows that the main Latin languages run about 10-15% longer than English. So when you couple that to sloppy translation you can get a huge expansion. When Jorge de Buen translated my &quot;Improving the Tool&quot; essay (~2,500 words) into Spanish and got a gain of only 14%, that was pretty impressive - the UN Charter is 17% longer. <BR> <BR>BTW, an Armenian from Lebanon has four &quot;unofficial&quot; languages!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I had to do a  <BR>newsletter in four languages once (Dutch, French,  <BR>English and German) and I got away with it by using  <BR>ITC Officina, as it has four distinct variations (even  <BR>to the non-typographic eye): Sans, Sans Italic, Serif,  <BR>Serif Italic. I designated the styles according to  <BR>&quot;verbosity&quot;: German was set in Sans Italic whereas  <BR>on the other side of the spectrum Serif was used  <BR>for English.

I agree with others: add titles, use icons, make one language oriented up and the other down, so you can't read the other unless you flip it. Whatever. It's better to crash and burn spectacularly than be silently disregarded. Enjoy finding new ways to display information. Your wackiest ideas may whittle down into the most innovative/ effective. <BR> <BR>Also, we don't know why your demos were &quot;trashed&quot; so offering guidance is a bit tricky&hellip;</div>

I wasn't whining at all &hellip; it's just that I have 8 classes, that are each 3 hours and that are basically all graphic design classes. Which means that for every class I have 2 hours of research and 6 hours of homework to do per week (minimum). You do the math and you'll realize that they're aren't enough hours in the day to allow me to do that. <BR> <BR>Then again, that's school for you. However, time because very precious to you in school as well as in the work place. No one likes to waste 6 hours working hard and then being told that what you did was &quot;worse than the original&quot; piece the teacher gave you. Which is what my teacher had told me. So yeah &hellip; I was frustated, but I wasn't trying to whine. I'm sorry if some people felt like I was. I was merely frustated and had a mental block for my project. <BR> <BR>I believe that's called being human.</div>
