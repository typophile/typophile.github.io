    changes the emphasis of the statement in a way that makes the parallel to the
    Obama slogan less obvious."

  body: "Note: 'pause between parts of a sentence'. It isn't a very good definition,
    but it at least gets the notion that what a comma indicates is the structure of
    the sentence not a pause per se. When we talk, we punctuate structure with pauses,
    so commas in writing and pauses in speaking serve parallel purposes. The sequence
    of words 'yes we can' may be uttered as either a single clause or as two clauses:
    'yes we can' or 'yes, we can'. How we read those two versions differs, as does
    how we would say them, both in terms of pause and emphasis. I watched again Obama's
    election night speech on YouTube, and it seemed clear to me that he was saying
    'Yes we can', not 'Yes, we can'.\r\n"

    else to offer the winning entry, or what to do with the proceeds of sales. We
    thought about giving the proceeds to a charity, to promote design, or to share
    it with the winner.\r\n\r\nWe just did not come to a conclusion. And we don't
    have any money. So if you have suggestions of what to do, if the shirt actually
    sells, we would love to hear from you. Leave your comment here or on the Plural
    site. And we will make an update with where the money from the sales will go.\r\n\r\nWe
    can also leave that up to the winner to decide.\r\nIf the shirt sells: money goes
    to\r\na) his pocket\r\nb) someone else's pocket\r\n\r\nWe don't want to rip any
    one off, we just don't have any thing else to give. Other than bragging rights,
    and a cool shirt.\r\n\r\nHope to see some of these tees in the contest, they are
    awesome.\r\n\r\nNow, according to Bergie, I am a bastard that rips off designers.
    And, since I am a designer myself, I should try self-respect, sometime, to stop
    ripping myself off.\r\n\r\n\u2013 Renata\r\n\r\n"

    final shirts herself because it's just what she and her colleagues like to do.
    That's how their other shirts are delivered, sealed with a little hand-crafted
    love. Do you really think there is a large profit margin for the time spent silk
    screening shirts by hand? I don't. Look at their web site and their flickr profile.
    They're just type enthusiasts like the rest of us. I am a friend and former colleague
    of these folks. They're definitely not scam artists or plagiarists. Just typophiles.
