    mostly&#41; before your post was <BR> here. Jack asked for purchase sources. Filling
    in <BR>the links with this forum&#39;s proprietary system takes <BR>some time
    though! <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve struck out finding a source for Echo or Horizon. <BR>How

    suspicion that neither of these faces have been digitized. Echo doesn&#39;t really
    do anything for me, but I&#39;d love to see a fresh version of Horizon Light.'
