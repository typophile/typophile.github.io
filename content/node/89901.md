body: Hi Guys - Was just wondering if you could help solve this problem for me. I
  have attached an image of a letterform (R in this case) that I have found which
  is quite unique. For some reason I think I have seen a font very similar to it in
  the past but cannot find it anywhere? I may be completely wrong and it could be
  a custom job but it would be good to know before I waste anymore time searching
  through font sites. Any help you can give in solving this mystery would be much
  appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/r_letterform_4940.jpg]
