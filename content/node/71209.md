  We need a workhorse text driven font.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n "

    would help, as there are <em>many</em> amazing ones out there. Personally, I think
    Lexicon and Trinit\xE9 are two of the absolutely best, but they cost a lot of
    money. I hope some day I\u2019ll land a job that\u2019ll let me license one of
    them."

  body: "Can you post a photo of the Garamond typesetting? They must be setting it
    wrong if it doesn't read well. I would consider it a workhorse -- it has small
    caps, oldstyle numerals, fractions, etc. And we've all read it so often that the
    reader isn't distracted by the face itself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the full
    features of this typeface is simply amazing:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In Brazil the most common fonts in books are Times New Roman, Adobe Garamond,
    Minion, Palatino, Berthold Garamond and Caslon. And Arial/Helvetica is largely
    used too (!).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't think these choices are based on readability
    or flexibility of use. I'm sure there is very much about tradition and typographical
    ignorance in many book design made here.\r\n\r\nThere are many good font options
    nowadays.\r\n\r\nFor a non fiction, technical book, I'd definitively avoid Garamond
    (all flavors) and also other Garaldes and Venetians. I'd favors some contemporary
    fonts like Novel, Athelas, Lyon, Calluna or Romulus. If the text is not continuous
    (I mean, if it mix graphics, tables, equations and so on) other choices could
    be Tiempos, Expo Pro, Documenta, Stuart, Skolar or Karmina.\r\n\r\nIf there is
    heavy numeric usage, pay special attention to the figures. Although the traditional
    old style numbers are very elegant, they are far from good to a text with many
    numbers."

  body: I know I'm at minority side on this, but I think that non-fiction texts are
    much better set with more contemporary fonts. Caslon and Janson are out of my
    choice, they produce a very classy but outdated effect to technical texts.
