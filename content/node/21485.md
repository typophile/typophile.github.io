    as a replacement for Electra. Cyrus took cues from Electra for its design.

    is an alternative digitization from the same source as Electra. It's a tad heavier
    and the ascend/descenders are shorter. It doesn't have all the Display styles,
    but I actually really prefer it to Electra for text.

  body: "In my opinion, you can go two ways with Granjon, both are unconventional:\r\n\r\n1.
    Poliphilus, along with Blado as its accompanying italic will produce a more 'rustic'
    look. They don't have the best kerning table or the tidiest outline, though.\r\n\r\n2.
    Dante, a more contemporary reinterpretation of Bembo. Charles Malin definitely
    infused his spirit when he cut this type (it hasn't lost with the digital conversion,
    too, in my opinion), producing a face that, perhaps comparable to how Jan Tschischold
    reinterpreted Garamond, is contemporary yet classic.\r\n\r\nI imagine that you
    wouldn't want to use something common like Sabon or Adobe Garamond.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and the new Garamond Premier Pro might work too, if your budget permits."

  body: I've set Fournier quite a few times and have always been pleased with the
    result, but thanks for posting the suggested Corundum Text as it looks to be a
    nice alternative; if it was available in a fully featured OT version I'd go for
    it. As for Loire, yeesh. The entire set seems clumsy, but the ascender serifs
    and diacritics are just nasty.

  body: "I selected Fournier MT Std (got it from Adobe) for a magazine/book design,
    and a corporate identity, and I too have been very pleased with it. It has quite
    a different look to it than any other roman. It is supposedly two unmatched roman
    and italic designs. The only real drawbacks are the lack of italic small caps,
    the lack of Tall Caps (which were in the PS version), and the mismatched italic,
    though this last part is surpeisingly not so important. The italic is really pretty
    weird looking.\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly, Plantin has some strangely short
    extenders.\r\n\r\nLoire appears to be a copy of a late 19th \u2013 early 20th
    century interpretation of Napoleonic typography,\r\n"

    too, but I'm not sure."

  body: I've been having this idea (for long) of making a revival/interpretation of
    Fournier. So far it's only in the sketch stage, but I would definitely make it
    more "inky" if so. Probably regular, medium and bold with almost the same kerning
    to prevent the copy from changing. I've done the same with Delicato, wish gives
    you the freedom to choose degree of "metal type feeling".
