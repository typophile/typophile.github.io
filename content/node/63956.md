    is really difficult to know them all, but the first thing is doing a little research
    to check if something similar has been made already. There are a lot of things
    yet to be done but you need to find them. But if happens that something mine is
    very similar to others, I\u2019d try to find something new to offer.\r\n\r\n<em>

    question. I try to see a hole to fill (oldstyle numerals, small caps, more weights,
    etc.). But first of all, I only start a project if I see that I can say something
    new. At least new to me, because other people may see no difference."

  body: "The question you want to ask is how useful will your font be. Answering this
    question is a function of your design skills and your knowledge of fonts.\r\n\r\nIs
    Christian Schwartz's \"Guardian\" font original? That depends on whom you ask.
    Personally, I don't think it's that original. Yet it is a very distinguished font,
    with a contemporary feel. Stag is a little more original, but not as useful. Sometimes
    originality means it will be less useful.\r\n\r\nScript fonts... lots of potential
    for originality there. And a big market too.\r\n\r\nLogo work calls for original
    fonts. Although most good logo designers either tweak existing fonts or make their
    own."

  body: "I think I'm learning that the concept behind a font can be more important
    than how similar it might seem to other fonts. If approached from a new angle,
    fonts generally end up with their own voice even if there are similarities with
    other fonts. I think a font needs to address a purpose and without that there's
    going to be no incentive for people to get excited about it. (One I started last
    week was just an aimless experiment and looked very nothingy.)\r\n\r\nEqually,
    modifying a font just so it look less like something else sounds like a bad idea.
    It needs to look like itself and if it shared characteristics with another one,
    perhaps that's a plus. Especially if the other font is successful. Of course I
    don't think one should intentionally based a design on someone else's but if it
    happens that way I think it's more truly expressing your intent. As people we
    can look at others for inspiration but we should aim to be most of all ourselves,
    no matter whether others are similar or dissimilar.\r\n\r\n>Sometimes originality
    means it will be less useful\r\nYes. I have the luxury of type design as a hobby.
    If I had to rely on it for my income I'd want to focus on usefulness, which might
    preclude originality, though I'd hope not. I was looking at Spiekermann's Axel
    today, which looks pretty useful, though very similar to Unit, Meta or Info, at
    least to my eye. Originality has to be very sure of itself to overcome the but-it's-less-useful
    threshhold. "

    and inspiration. I agree with Bendy that it might not be a bad thing to have similarities,
    as long as you approach your design from a different angle and give it it\u2019s
    own personality."

    some people will just prefer your approach. Lots of different winemakers make
    similar style wines, but none of them are exactly the same. Same with typefaces.\r\n\r\nAs
    a fan of sicilian wine I can tell you there are lots of producers making wine
    from nero d'avola but only a few are my favorites.\r\n\r\nOf course I suppose
    the entry point is making something of quality."
