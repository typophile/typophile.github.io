  If it's correct, it could be a great teaching tool. "

  body: The later stages, showing the moving and introduction of new letters in the
    Latin script, are quite good. The early Phoenician -> Greek -> Etruscan development
    is a bit over simplified, but no worse than one finds in most non-specialist books
    on the alphabet. What is missing is the range of variation in letterforms in the
    early Greek. And the whole notion of 'Phoenician' is problematic, since what it
    really is is an ancient Canaanite alphabet that was used by lots of different
    semitic peoples and languages. It just happens that the Greeks got it from the
    Phoenicians, and this has led to the myth that the Phoenicians invented the alphabet.

  body: "There are some other problems, too. According to this little animation, the
    U is a variant of the V, and not the other way around. By the same token, the
    I shouldn't slide over to fill the empty slot, but rather a new slot should open
    for the J.\r\n\r\nAnd \"Some European Additions\" to describe the Eth and a handful
    of accented letters is really simplistic, and seems to indicate that accents are
    an afterthought, and with no clear date of adoption."

  body: It's interesting that the 16th century spelling reformer Trissino proposed
    three reforms, adding characters to distinguish between u and v, i and j, and
    short and long o. He printed works demonstrating these reforms, including using
    the Greek omega for the long o. Two of these innovations were eventually universally
    adopted by the 17th century. And the other, well, if a butterfly had flapped its
    wings in Japan ... we might have an omega in the Latin alphabet today. (And no
    "w"?!)

  body: "I figured it must have been simplified. I remember a few rather long, dry
    lectures in design school about the history of letterforms, so I had a hunch that
    a cute animated GIF wasn't going to capture it all. \r\n\r\n(And <em>thank you</em>
    to Alessandro for pointing to the proper origin of the piece! Professor Fradkin
    has several other 'evolutions' on that page also, for those who are curious.)"
