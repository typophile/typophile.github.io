  marks used in a child's play area in an indoor shopping mall. Looks like there is
  a question mark, ampersand, semi-colon, asterik, parentheses, etc., but no letters.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nIan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChildrensPuncuationPlayground_4449.jpg]"

  body: Ian, do you have any more pictures? Especially the ampersand could be quite
    helpful.

  body: Nice, that's where I'm located! I looked it up on Google to no avail. I'll
    have to figure it out and take the kids, it's incredible. I've always had the
    idea to do a gallery show some day and have similar larger than life sized typographic
    sculptures, among other things.
