  working on. The client asked for a \"clean, fresh, open minded feel\", but it should
  also feel somehow \"technical.\" More importantly I have a question if there already
  is such logo (since it seems like pretty obvious, but appealing idea.) I appreciate
  any leads or comments. Thanks. Jan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fresh Research.jpg]"

    and full name to be less huge \u2014 the whole stuff would probably appear visually
    stronger. Besides, there's not much here looking \"technical\" to me: wouldn't
    it be possible to use another typeface ? This one, with the two shades of blue,
    reminds me of an optician's sign. But I may be wrong, of course."

    'S's bother me. The top loop looks like it's drooping a little. They also look
    too short. Is this type you designed?\r\n\r\nAlso, the mark, as a whole, sits
    oddly. How will it work when it's on letterhead or an advertisement? Be careful
    with the shape the overall logo creates."

  body: "I second Celeste about exploring another face; the weights don't feel up
    to the task of a logo just now. I think it starts mostly from the size & stroke
    relationship of the circle itself--perhaps get that looking right first, and then
    choose an appropriate type.\r\n\r\nJust to throw an idea out there: what about
    a solid circle and a negative R? With a careful application of a \"glass highlight\"
    you might have something better. I say \"careful\" because a cutely \"illustrated\"
    treatment is right out.\r\n\r\nThe concept, here, is <em>very</em> smart and completely
    appropriate. Good job.\r\n"

  body: Thank you guys for your kind words and great points. I agree that the relationship
    between the letter and the circle has to be resolved (I think I should push it
    a little more) The typeface is Engravers Gothic and I chose it because of it's
    extended character (so that I could accomodate the "F", "R" with the intersecting
    circle. I'd however prefer typeface with thinner strokes in its thin cut for "F"
    and combine it with medium or bold cut for the "R" (I welcome suggestions). The
    mark is meant for the website for now with a possibility of stationery application
    later. I'll exploree the relationship between the mark and type more. Thanks again.

  body: Lighter of two blues is quite light and may not project well through LCD projectors
    etc. I never like to put two colours together without some white in between as
    this throws in problems when it comes to mono version or photocopied version etc.
    I think if you are going to go for two weights of type then you won't necessarily
    need the lighter of the blues anyway. Then you may want to change the colour of
    the magnifying device (again making it a single colour). I'm sure that some will
    say that will take the charm away from it. Agree with comments on the S. Also
    I would try not to get bogged down with the double occurence of the letters RES
    in both words. It might work it might not. Trying to force it maybe constraining
    you with the layout of the type.

    aligning the RES parts of the words, because I'd like to use other complimentary
    words on the website that have RES in it (address, respondents, corespondence,
    press room etc.) under the logo for each section. Plus I thought it worked with
    the \"research\" topic (looking for and organizing results according to similarities).
    I tried one knock out version, but even though it might be visually stronger I
    think I'm loosing the \"magnified\" effect there a little bit (what do you guys
    think?). Thank you again for your comments. Jan\r\nP.S. Technical question, how

    Right now the type and mark are competing quite a bit, because they are so simliar.\r\n\r\nOne
    strategy: try a heavier weight for \"FRESH RESEARCH\", taking the point size down
    to about half of what you have now, and letterspacing it to lighten it up again.
    If you flush it left and rag the E of \"FRESH\" on the left sidebearing of your
    mark, it should lock up pretty nicely with the shape; I expect the line of the
    R's leg would lead to the end of \"RESEARCH\", which is almost happening now.\r\n\r\nTim
    is right that you are losing the metaphor slightly, in exchange for a stronger
    form. Try putting a gentle crescent knock-out on the circle and see how that strikes
    you?"

    I am looking for more of an emotional appeal and I'm not getting it, except for
    the striking red blood bubble. I have liked this logo concept since the original
    post, but I'm still not feelin' it.\r\n\r\nSomebody suggested exploring alternative
    typefaces earlier. I think your Avenir selection is a good alternative to your
    original choice, but have you considered any options that change the overall feel?
    Right now, it does have a technical feel, but from your client's request to use
    warm colors (not necessarily a hot red) I wonder if a warmer, more human feel
    to the logo would be appropriate.\r\n\r\nA couple of suggestions might be to use
    a softer typeface (not necessarily Meta, but something like it) and warm colors
    vs. hot (I believe in sociology, \"red\" indicates heat, violence, power, etc.).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FreshIdea.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    didn't attempt to recreate your logo, as you've done a great job with your concept,

      the generic logo circle. And I like where it's going a lot.\r\n\r\nBut as executed
      right now, the scale of the crescent to the R breaks the metaphor. You could
      clip the R along the bottom curve, or make the circle big enough (visually,
      if not technically) to hold the R. Try both?\r\n\r\nStill, excellent progress."

    least play the logotype down, put it on one line. The last one is an interesting
    idea, but I'd have the highlight/curve in the same color. I'd also change the

    out of proportion. I also decided to leave the RES allingnment and go with U&lc.

    You could probably afford to go slightly thicker on the eyeglass/crescent. You
    might want to artificially 'finish' the ends/points of the crescent to avoid disappearance
    at smaller sizes and also to avoid a problem with vinyls if ever used. Sharp points
    and self adhesive (eg on signage) are not good bedfellows. I really liked your
    initial use of Engravers Gothic for the legend but agree that the S's left a lot
    to be desired. I prefer the type in one line too. Something like this...?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FR.gif]\r\n\r\nYou
    could of course do your type in a different colour or do the device as a tint
    of the colour used for the type.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FR2.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    did this one smaller so you can start to think of some of the practicalities of
    the mark when it is reproduced at small sizes. Some things start to suffer a little,

    to gravitate towards color combinations that have a neutralizing base color to
    use as accent or vice versa. Of course there are instances where I go against
    this. \r\n\r\nScott's version of the logo had a cool gray with the warm pumpkin,
    but because it had too much cyan/blue in it it grayed out the pumpkin color. Jan's
    version with the warm gray version also detracted from the pumpkin because I see
    too much magenta/red in the color. The last version above has a gray that is basically
    a neutral and I think acts as a counterpoint to the warmer color. \r\n\r\nI miss
