  do I need to create minuscule ordinals, or can they be superior versions of the
  caps?"

  body: "In theory, \"in theory\" motives work. In practice...\r\n\r\nI'd make the
    ordinals based on majuscules, just because they'd fit in. Don't just scale existing
    glyphs, though. Gotta look good. Imagine a headline title (in all caps) about
    \"La 1\xAA Mujer que ha hecho...\" (I'm assuming you're also doing numerals).
    \r\n\r\nThat brings up another thing...would you want oldstyle numerals with an
    all caps font? Hrm...I could see them working if they're as tall as the capitals,
    with the descenders/ascenders going below/above the letters...sorta. I'd have
    to see it in practice to know whether or not I'm crazy here.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

    see for JT's example, \"La 1\xAA mujer\" would be:\r\n\r\nLA PRIMERA MUJER\r\nLA
    1A MUJER\r\nLA 1\xAA MUJER\r\n\r\nIn order I prefer the top, bottom, and middle.
    \ A raised capital A is interesting, though I've never seen it used, the lowercase
    version is perfectly acceptable.  If it looks good though no reason not to include
    it tho :)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos
