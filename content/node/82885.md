  your type designs to the Letter.2 competition ends on June 20. Only 12 days to go.\r\nVisit
  www.letter2.org to find out more about the competition rules and register to submit
  your entries.\r\n\r\nAbout Letter.2\r\nLetter.2 aims to provide a wide-angled snapshot
  of the state of typeface design around the globe ten years after the 2001 competition,
  and to promote typographic excellence and best professional practices. It also intends
  to raise awareness about the role of typography at encouraging and maintaining cultural
  diversity.\r\n\r\nAll typefaces published (commercially or non-commercially) between
  October 2001 and August 2011 are allowed to enter the competition. The jury will
  meet in Buenos Aires in October 2011 and will make a selection of winning entries
  based on their design excellence. The winning designs will be exhibited at the 2012
  ATypI conference\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJos\xE9 Scaglione"

    that you are holding a type design competition that is sponsored by type design
    companies. Are these sponsors allowed to enter? Seems like an enormous conflict
    of interest to me."

    any of the faces submitted.

    to have two threads going: one for plain\r\nlogistical stuff (which I myself have
    questions about) and\r\nanother for candid discourse (which I just <em>might</em>
    participate in :-).\r\nAnd the latter already exists: http://typophile.com/node/79374\r\n\r\nJames,
    Nick: I think it would be both gracious and useful\r\nif you would transfer your

    were liable to be susceptible to any kind of pressure from either organisers or
    sponsors, I might agree, but it's a pretty bolshie group, and don't think anyone
    would be stupid enough to try to apply such pressure."
