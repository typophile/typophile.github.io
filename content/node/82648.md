  for free/buy \r\nnice Chinese typefaces, that will work on Mac OS X. I'm scouring
  the internet and have yet to find anything that isn't either a broken link or turns
  into default English type when I download it!\r\nThank you. "

  body: How does a font turn into 'default English type'? You are not expecting a
    font to translate your English text into Chinese, are you?
