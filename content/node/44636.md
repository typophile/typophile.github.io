body: "I am wondering about best practices of creating logotypes using a selected
  font. Is it acceptable to use a font in your logotype without any modification/customization
  to the typeface? I\u2019m sure this is not a best practice but do most designers
  typically follow this rule and to what degree is this looked upon with disapproval?
  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: There are no rules. You'd best make sure it's OK per the EULA but otherwise
    there are plenty of logos that just use fonts. Creating a custom logotype would
    be more original, but it's not frowned on (at least by me) to use a font as is.

  body: "The fact of the matter is that any one can run off a unmodified typeface
    for a logotype. By adding decoration or embellishment one can start to form a
    logotype of distinction.\r\n\r\nBut by all means its not frowned upon, certainly
    not from my point of view."

    in some nations.
