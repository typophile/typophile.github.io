  square version, clean, modern, etc.  \r\n\r\nThis is exactly what I'm looking for,
  only a much larger set for a variety of situations.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    to the AIGA set.\r\n\r\nHas anyone used the ISO 7000 set before? I can't even
    get a sample PDF indicating what they look like."
