  design by Mary Jane Callister/Louise Fili Ltd.\r\nTypology by Steven Heller and
  Louise Fili has a nice cover, some letters though overlap the rectangles. Helpfully
  enough the book contains the original design which was a type specimen sheet by
  Bruce Rodgers of a Frederic Goudy 1924 type design."

  body: I think it would only qualify as stealing if they hadn't included the original.
    In fact, all of the books in their series have been versions of something from
    the interior.

  body: "It's not either/or, there are shades of \"call it what it is\".\r\nThe book
    cover in question totally swipes someone else's layout -- but as we now believe,
    there's more to design than layout, concept is important too. Is the concept here
    original -- i.e. taking an old piece of artwork and substituting new copy for
    all or part of it?\r\nOf course not, so the question is, how well or cleverly
    is the substitution handled; and indeed there is some subtlety in the choice of
    how much of the text has been rewritten, and how to highlight it in colour. There
    is also the quality of the reconstruction (or forgery as Uli would term it) to
    be considered. But despite all those considerations, it's still not as good as
    creating an original layout in the style of Rogers would have been.\r\n\r\nI produced
    a specimen brochure for my 1920s-style typeface Oneleigh, in which I took pages
    from old specimen books of that era and substituted Oneleigh, with fresh text.
    I also did some original layouts. Appropriation was a lot easier, of course, and
    you know the design is good, so no self-doubt about that. And the contrast between
    the original and the new is fascinating in its own right. But I'm not sure any
    of that really comes in to play beyond the redesigner and a few viewers, as most
    aren't aware of the repurposing. It does feel good, remaking something exquisite
    and venerable, which is a powerful justification for the redesigner. Like performing
    a classic piece of music, or copying an old type design, when it all comes together,
    bingo. Although others who have not been through the process might not be so convinced.\r\n\r\nConsidered
    for its marketing power (getting people to look at the book and buy it), the Typology
    cover is outright plagiarism. But once you get the book, and realize how clever
    the relationship between past and present is, that changes things.\r\n\r\nThese
    days, across the arts, more respect is given to thinking than making, which validates
    the process of \"appropriation\", as the use of that euphemistic term (with knowing
    irony or not) would suggest.\r\n\r\n"

    there is nothing wrong with designers shining a little light on the matter."
