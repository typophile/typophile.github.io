  already saw it a couple of times on German propaganda and on postwar documents/books

  body: "There is a font by Carlos Winkow from 1938 for Wagner, called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/reporter/|Reporter]],
    that has a very similar feel, although it is not identical. Some tweaking could
    make a closer resemblance to this (probably) custom, hand-drawn lettering.\r\n\r\n-
