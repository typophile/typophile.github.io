body: Hey all. I am having some problems here. <BR> <BR>Wanted to see what font agent
  was all about, so I tried it. My biggest problem with it is it splits my suitcases.
  I want to have the typeface with its various weights/styles available as a sub menu
  item. <BR> <BR>So I went back to Suitcase. All is well except now if I try to find
  duplicates, Suitcase crashes. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts? <BR> <BR> <BR>Matt

    Pro does, indeed, split out the suitcases into individual styles. <BR>This is
    a big bonus and one of the most important reasons for selecting <BR>FontAgent
    Pro. It has the following benefits: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Allows more precise organization
    <BR>2&#41; Permits documents to be smaller since not all fonts need to be loaded
    <BR>3&#41; Salvages unusable suitcases by allowing a user to retrieve the good
    fonts <BR>from an otherwise damaged suitcase <BR>4&#41; Provides greater system
    stability by eliminating problem fonts <BR> <BR>AND, he gets all of this without
    paying the price of losing the organization <BR>that he wants! There is a check
    box in the libraries pane to group the fonts <BR>by name or show them individually.
    He apparently has them set up to view <BR>individually, rather than by family.  <BR>
    <BR>BTW, as far as Suitcase crashing, it sounds like he doesn&#39;t have the fonts
    <BR>available for Suitcase to manage, but he shouldn&#39;t want to go back there
    <BR>anyway. He could have tried copying fonts to do the trial, but if he just
    <BR>takes the fonts out from under FontAgent Pro management, everything should
    <BR>work as well as before.<!-/quote-!><hr size=0></blockquote>'
