  Paris (when the magazine was under Colombe Pringle direction) anywhere and I've
  scoured the internet!\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I want to ID the typeface used on 1989
  covers - does anyone know what this is??\r\n\r\nI've uploaded a couple of images
  of what I'm referring to.\r\n\r\nIf I am lucky enough that someone knows - please
  could you also inform me where I might download/buy it??\r\n\r\nThanks!!!\r\n"
