    not-for-free font for a job.

    to have someone else give your work away for free without even asking you?\r\n\r\nYou
    might contact the foundry and ask for a sample GIF or JPG. They might even help
    you out.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    to convert the text to outlines and resend you the file.\r\n\r\nMan, this must
    be the lamest excuse <em>ever</em> for asking for a pirated copy of a font. BTW
    There is a very strict policy regarding this on Typophile -- you can consider
    yourself lucky you didn't get kicked off the Forum yet."
