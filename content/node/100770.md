  Keep. I'm not educated in typography so I would appreciate if someone could tell
  me two things:\r\n\r\n1. More about the type of letters used for this logo. Anything
  about the origins and usage so I could find more instances that look alike.\r\n\r\n2.
  Is there a font that resembles this logo (the line is relatively thin and always
  of the same width, letters have these unusual serifs and ornaments in the middle
  which I don't know the name for)\r\n\r\nThank you very much\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BFRT_00-756x492_5610.jpg]"

    on which characteristics are prominent, it might also be described as an ironwork
    font, a wood font, a tuscan design, etc. The middle ornaments are often called
    spurs, and are common on Western typefaces.\r\n\r\n- Herb"

  body: "Thank you Herb. You've helped me a lot.\r\n\r\nI've already seen the designers
    description but couldn't find much googling \"ironwork font\" or \"sport insignias\".
    But tuscan design you mentioned returned good results. Actually, when I looked
    for \"tuscan monoline\" I found some similar letterings.\r\n\r\nDo you maybe have
    know some good fonts similar to this logo. (Tuscan and relatively thin monoline.
    Also, hand-drawn look would be great.)\r\n\r\nAnd do you have a suggestion where
    can I read more about tuscan lettering. I tried googling but I find it very hard
    to find some dictionary or encyclopedia-like article about the term."

    not really a style that readily lends itself to a hand-written look.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a vaguely similar font (which you've probably already found)\r\nIronworks (Fonts.com)\r\nThere
