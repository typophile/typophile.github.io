  \u2018automotive\u2019 because it was created for a magazine of the same name. It
  is used for headlines and logo. It's a unicase font.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d appreciate
  your critique very much!"

  body: "The curves, particularly in the tops of the t, s and a, are wobbly... weird
    and unsettling.  If that's what you're going for, great.  If not, I'd suggest
    making the stroke width uniform, and the curves smoother. \r\n\r\n-matt"
