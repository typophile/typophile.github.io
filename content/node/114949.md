  I found this article\r\n\r\n[[http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/09/27/shady-characters-irony/]]\r\n\r\nwhich
  I do not believe was cited in a thread here about a new punctuation mark to indicate
  irony. Which is a pity, as it supplies important historical data, including an 1899
  proposal for such a mark."
