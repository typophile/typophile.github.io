  version of Gerard Ungers Swift, but we wanted the OpenType version for our client,
  and so we went a-looking. But I can't find one that includes both small caps and
  old style figures. I've found the small caps in the PRO version but the OS figures
  are impossible to find. Or I could be going blind. \r\nCould anyone of you with
  better eyesight and/or stamina direct me towards a proper version?\r\n\r\nIt would
  be appreciated.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\u0192\r\n"

    I could of course mail him, but I was hoping someone here knew before I bothered
    him.\r\nThanks anyway.\r\n\r\n\u0192\r\n\r\n"

    the Swift 2.0 doesn\u2019t have the OSF and SC in the same font."

  body: "That is a good question! Unfortunately, I do not know the answer. Swift was
    originally produced at Hell, if I recall, which became part of Linotype in 1989.
    But by that time, there were may or may not have been other legitimate versions
    of Swift in distribution. I suspect that, as was the case with some other faces
    during their conversion to OpenType, Linotype may not have had its own SC and
    OsF font data available. If this were the case, the only way to include them in
    the OT fonts might have been to redraw the SC and OsFs glyphs directly. What goes
    into a legacy OpenType font is not as simple a decision as one might wish it to
    be, and it depends on a number of factors in the air at the time of the font's
    conversion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I feel bad that we don't have an off-the-shelf
    solution for Fredrik, which is why I suggested Gerard's website. But that does
    seem to just offer PostScript and TT Swift 2.0 fonts. I'm sorry that I cannot
    be of more help :("

    Swift OpenType option \u2013 the lesser alternative I'm afraid. \r\nAt least there's
    a lesson to be learned here.\r\n\r\n(Dan, for our next client I'll make sure to
    get FF Chambers, I believe you'd like that)"

    yes, as I wrote on my blog, I am a big fan of FF Chambers Sans\u2026 and all of
    Verena's other work, too."
