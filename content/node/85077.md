  those of you who speak languages other than English, what ligatures do you wish
  were more common?\r\n\r\nTo add to that, what letter combinations appear frequently
  enough in other languages to warrant such ligatures? (ex. is /f/iacute/ a more frequent
  combination than /f/idieresis/?)\r\n\r\nIn the hope that I can eventually make a
  typeface that is truly capable of being used outside the English-Speaking world,
  I'd like to make it as refined and intuitive for other orthographies as most are
  for English."

    In Norwegian, gg and gj are also frequent potential collissions."
