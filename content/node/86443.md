  to send someone my fonts, then get them back all kerned and ready for market in
  an .otf and .ttf format.\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend a company?\r\nIt would be nice
  to get quotes from a few different companies/ freelancers to see who offers the
  best service.\r\n\r\nSo far, all I have is:-\r\n1. www.ikern.com"

      1000% above the next highest quote, which was a high quote to start with.\r\nSo
      I felt somewhat insulted and shocked by such an astronomical amount.\r\nNeedless
      to say, I will never ask him for another quote, or recommend him to any one."

    think many type designers would be happy take on this kind of job, if the time
    frame, money and/or quality of the design is fitting. "

  body: In any case be sure you have the *spacing* of the letters in good state. Saves
    you Hundreds if not Thousands of kerning pairs.

  body: "I have no idea what JBL quoted, but I am not surprised that there are big
    differences in the pricing of type design and/or type production work. Quality
    type design is a highly sought-after service, and extremely time consuming. Let\u2019s
    say the minimal (a number I\u2019m pulling out of the hat for the example) time
    it takes to space and kern four masters is a five working days. With a hourly
    wage of \u20AC75 that comes to \u20AC2625. Sure, you can find a wannabe type designer
    to do the work for a fraction of the price, but you\u2019ll not be hiring a professional."
