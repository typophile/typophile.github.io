body: "Hello!\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone asked me to design a typographic tatoo for his fore
  arm. \r\nIts a three word sentence set in all caps,\r\nand it has to run aprox.
  6 inches wide. \r\nAs for the design I am considering Baskerville's or other transitional
  fonts,\r\nbut the client seems to want a similar font with higher cap-heigth.\r\n\r\n-
  \"I want the letters to be taller, cant you stretch them up?!\"\r\n- \"NOooooo.
  I wont do that...! I'll have to find another font!, \r\nif i did that i would distort
  de proportions of the letters....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions of tall cap fonts
  in this style?\r\nAny suggestion at all?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n"
