  body: Not a font; it's been constructed from the bones of several different (probably
    generic) typefaces.

  body: "I'm 99.9% sure it's completely custom. Ignition Print (the company that created
    the campaign) will have been responsible for localising the posters for the international
    market, and therefore will have had to adapt the logo and copy as appropriate.
    If you examine the Russian poster, most of the Cyrillic characters have been adapted
    from the Roman ones in the original logo.\r\n\r\nIf someone else knows and can
    prove otherwise, I'll be convinced. Until then I stand by the not-a-font diagnosis.\r\n\r\n-NJ"
