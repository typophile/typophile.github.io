body: I'm looking for this typeface that was used in the flag of a magazine from the
  1930s. It was probably originally hand drawn, but I'm hoping there is an OTF or
  TTF version (or something very similar) out there. If anyone has an ideas, I'd appreciate
  it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yen-sin-type_4895.png]
