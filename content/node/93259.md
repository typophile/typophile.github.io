  use with our workplace ERP finance software (running on Windows). We've been advised
  to use Fontlab's Font Lab Studio - does anyone know if this will work and the legalities
  around it?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    touch with Seb Lester, the designer of the font.  He's quite an amenable chap.

  body: "When you say \"editable version\", do you simply mean a one-off customized
    version? Because \"editable\" makes it sound more involved, like giving your employees
    the ability to freely modify the font as needed over time - which is a whole different
    kettle of fish, and something few font houses would agree to (which means you'd
    need to commission your own custom font instead of modifying Neo Sans).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Usually, editing Commercial fonts by yourself is not allowed.\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand, your are free (as in freedom), allowed, and encouraged to edit Open
    Source fonts.\r\nAlso, many open source fonts include the \"un-merged\" source
    files, making edits much more easy.\r\n\r\nYou can get almost all the source files
    for the Open Source fonts featured in Google Webfonts from here: http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/\r\n\r\nAnd
    a few more from the Open font Library:\r\nhttp://openfontlibrary.org/\r\n"

  body: "We need an editable version of the font because the finance ERP software
    uses an automated print run. If we print the PDFs manually the font prints correctly,
    but if we use the print run program the fonts print as Arial. \r\n\r\nI'll try
    contacting Seb Lester directly.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: "Robinhall, that really <em>really</em> doesn't sound like a problem with
    Neo Sans. You'd better contact the manufacturor of your finance software.\r\n\r\nWhat
    does an \"editable\" font look like? In what way do you think making the font
    \"Editable\" would solve your print problem? Tinker with the font until it suddenly
    works?"

    Microsoft's site, the expression \"editable embedding\" is actually used to describe
    what the fsType bit mask number 3 allows."
