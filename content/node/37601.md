body: "Hey everybody, the relative size unit <strong>Em</strong> measuring type size
  is capitalized in the context of digital type in order to distinguish it from the
  smallest unit in font editors which is all lower case <strong>em</strong>, right?
  So in a PostScript Type1 font the Em measures 1000em. Is that assumption correct?
  In books about letterpress however the Em is spelled in all lower case. Does anybody
  know of the historic background and the rational behind this and do you think these
  units should be spelled consistently? After all the notation for a metric meter
  won't change wether you measure steel or hardwood floor... \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nHannes"

    1 em of any font gives a square (as opposed to rectangular) area.\r\n\r\nWhen
    an em is divided by 1000, the only term I have heard is unit. Unit is not a consistent
    unit -- in older systems units were 18 or 54 to the em. The closest one could
    come to a standard definition is that the unit is the smallest amount that an
    em could be split into when providing different widths for glyphs.\r\n\r\nIf I
    am not mistaken, one of the sales points of the Monotype system early in the last
    century was that it used 54 units per em, while Linotype machines were at 18 units
    per em."

  body: "As Bill points out, Don, unitized widths were a characteristic of Monotype
    and not of Linotype.\r\n\r\nThe Monotype system employed a matrix-case which was
    typically 15 x 15. All characters in a given row needed to have the same set width.
    So, designs were restricted to a system which divided the em into 18 units (not
    all increments were used for each font). This unitized system was also integral
    to the calculations of the Monotype justification method.\r\n\r\nThe Linotype,
    on the other hand, had no unitized width restrictions. However, it was not possible
    to have any kerns (character elements projecting beyond the metal body), which
    was possible in Monotype. Also, most Linotype families had two styles on a single
    matrix, which meant that the two designs had to have the same widths -- i.e.,
    be \"duplexed\". There were usually options for Roman duplexed with Italic or
    Roman duplexed with Bold. This had a distinct advantage for certain types of typesetting,
    but a distinct challenge to the type designer.\r\n\r\nAs Bill notes, early Linotype
    photo-typesetters did have unitized systems, because of certain mechanical restrictions
    in the advance drive motor. Also, in the newspaper industry, TTS was a pervasive
    standard which required unitized widths, and this was applied to Linotype newspaper
    types.\r\n\r\nRegarding the original question, I've never heard that capitalization
    made any difference. An em is as has been described. I've always heard the units
    used in digital font applications referred to as \"em units\" -- which for Postscript
    fonts is 1/1000th of an em.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Having a limited number of character widths in a font does provide a certain
    rigor and discipline to the type design.\r\nAnd the reductive duplexing of roman
    and italic (eg Sabon, Optima, Univers) gives a distinctly modern character to
    typefaces designed with that in mind.\r\n\r\nWith so many options for width now,
    and global kerning, it's easy to be sloppy, and the aesthetic departs from one
    which is \"scalar\" -- i.e. having an inbuilt, mandated predisposition towards
    harmonic relationships between character widths.\r\n\r\nFoundry types had scalar
    widths (and this goes at least as far back as Manutius, see <em>Types of Space</em>,
    a very practical reason being that this facilitated justification. The system
    incorporated a variety of space characters, so that \"s+hair space=n\" (or something
    like that, I'm not familiar with the exact maths)."

    typefounders had a kind of unit system for letters, of the kind that Monotype
    used in order to justify its lines, I'm doubtful if this was ever the case: the
    width of hand-cast type depends on the setting of the registers of the mould,
    and is beyond the control of the punchcutter or matrix maker. Given the idiosyncracies
    of individual casters, it can be different every time a new fount is made. To
    be sure modular \u2018self-spacing' type was introduced at the end of the 19th
    century \u2013 but only when long-haul hand setting of type was nearly over.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the exactly regular modular spaces of Aldus, which Peter Burnhill thought
    he had detected, judging from my limited experience as a compositor I think these
    would be very unhelpful. The classic set is thin, mid and thick \u2013 or 5, 4
    and 3 spaces to the em quad. Their odd combinations produce subtle increments,
    or reductions (or whatever the opposite of increment is), which are a godsend
    when a line is just too loose or just too tight, as often happens. But judging
    what just too loose, or just too tight, or indeed just right, all mean is a matter
    of feedback through your fingers. The number of words to be spaced varies unpredictably
    from line to line, and you may want bigger spaces between two l's than two o's.
    Setting type well by hand is not a completely rational and mathematical business,
    thank goodness."

    were, I believe a characteristic of both. When I was at Linotype I found many
    drawings on an 18 unit system and all the new faces we made were on 54 units.
    There are unit systems hiding in other places as well. E.G. Highway Gothic, we
    found, was made on a 10 unit system, most likely we surmised, to make the composition
    of road signs much easier for USDOT employees in a the precomputer age. \r\n\r\nRegarding
    the original question, some of us are waiting with great anticipation for the
    all-encompassing definition of \"Em or em\" as promised by T. Phinney on Wikipedia
    a year ago. Since this promise chased out all the other definitions of \"em\",
    it should be interesting to see what he comes up with, no? \r\n\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    You were at Linotype toward the end, right -- late 70s? As I alluded to in my
    post, the Linotype photo typesetters were unitized. The early machines were constrained
    to 18 units. The V-I-P was able to handle a finer system of 54 units. I would
    expect this is what you were drawing for, right?\r\n\r\nAlso, the TTS system was
    18 units, IIRC. (I remember an anecdote from Mike Parker: something to the effect
    that Jackson Burke lamented that much of his reign at MLCo consisted of overseeing
    the continual revision of Corona to the TTS system as newspapers desired to increase
    their body sizes.)\r\n\r\nI also wouldn't be surprised if faces that were originally
    Monotype faces maintained their original 18-unit widths when done up for Lino
    (even in metal) -- e.g., TNR. And, of course, Sabon complied with 18 units to
    be \"cross-platform.\"\r\n\r\nMy original point was that unitized widths were

    was that MLCo was sold off to Allied Chemical in 1979, and then moved offshore
    not too long thereafter (what I call \"the end\").\r\n\r\nBy \"unitized widths\"
    I mean a system of discreet and relatively coarse divisions of the em. Is this
    what you mean as well?\r\n\r\nObviously, there was a minimum discreet increment
    for the drafting and machining of Linotype characters. Off the top of my head,
    I think it was 0.00025 inches. So, I suppose you could say that the Linotype used
    a 333-unit system (for 12-point type; more like 4000 units for 72 pt). But I don't
    think that's what we're talking about.\r\n\r\n<cite> > All pre-digital systems
    needed to count and move in increments coarser than those of the grid </cite>\r\n\r\nAlmost
    all; but not quite.\r\n\r\nYes: from what I know, the Monotype composition system
    (in metal) employs a mechanical calculator -- justifying by basically adding up
    character widths in the line and then calculating the wordspace by distributing
    the leftover space when the compositor indicates an end-of-line. Different arrangements
    of the matrix-case (i.e., which characters are in which unit row) require different
    cylinders for the composing machine, in order to properly calculate the line.
    (That is, the machine needs to \"know\" whether the n character is 9 or 10 units
    in the particular face at hand.)\r\n\r\nIn distinct contrast, however, the Linotype
    justifies by a purely mechanical means. The space bands are wedge shaped. As the
    compositor reachs the end of a line and decides where to break, the wedges are
    then physically forced upward to push out the line before casting the slug. No
    discreet increments (smooth, evenly tapered wedge) = no math = no calculation
    necessary. So, no organized system of widths needed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand:
    yes, the early Linofilm photosetters rely upon a writing prism that travels at
    a constant speed, and I believe justification is achieved through some kind of
    calculation. (My understanding of this system is not as thorough.) Factors such
    as the speed of the drive and the minimum amount of time required to open and
    close the shutter have some bearing on the constraints of advance widths. \r\n\r\nThe
    V-I-P, developed later, employs a stepping motor and can move discontinuously
    (even standing still!), which allows more flexibility (thus, 54 instead of 18
    units).\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"
