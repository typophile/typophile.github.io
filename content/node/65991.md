    the right G. The weight made have been altered by adding black stroke, and then
    a light offset to outline the lettering. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "One that was close, but not exact was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/ronnia-basic/|Ronnia
    Basic Heavy]] from Type-Together. The S and G would both need tweaking, but it
    could work, if a better match doesn't show up. Another was [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/flyer/|Flyer]],
    which would need work to close the G.\r\n\r\nI have not checked freebie fonts,
    but that might be another possibility. MyFonts was hard to find the combination
    of a similar G with an open S like this. The 'i' looks like it was flattened to
    be the same height, hence the flat dot.\r\n\r\n Mike Yanega"
