  body: "It looks like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-goudy-oldstyle/|Goudy
    Old Style]] with an alternate 'a'. This link is for the Lanston Type version,
    but it does not show this alternate 'a', which resembles the italic 'a' straightened
    up.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: It's one of those "infant" fonts, special versions of popular typefaces altered
    to make them better for teaching reading (supposedly). I remember seeing this
    one in Dorling Kindersley children's books when my daughter was little. Not sure
    who makes it.

  body: "Yes, Bembo has a schoolbook version with a single storey 'a', but I had not
    seen one for Goudy before. (Cool photo Mark! I've been away for a while, when
    is that from?)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I don't know if this is accurate, but Wikipedia says about Goudy Old Style:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Digital
    copies have been made by Monotype Imaging, DTP Types, The League of Moveable Type,
    Electric Typographer, Lanston Type, Bitstream, URW++, Adobe, and Linotype. Goudy
    Catalog has been copied by Scangraphic, Bitstream, URW++, and Elsner+Flake. <strong>A
    version called Goudy Schoolbook also exists, with single-story versions of the
    letters a and g, but it is not for sale to the general public.</strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goudy_Old_Style"

  body: Up until now I didn't get any further. I'll contact the publisher and ask
    if they keep records of their fonts in use. Who know's. I'll go for the Goudy
    Children (schoolbook adaptation of Goudy Old Style).
