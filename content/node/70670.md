  body: "It's better not to put multiple requests in the same thread. And it's also
    best when you give a more descriptive title, even though I'm sure you recognize
    this one as yours ;-)\r\n\r\nOnce again, the B is a slab serif, and almost any
    slab serif family ought to yield a similar B in one of the weights. (See my answer
    in your previous helmet post)\r\n\r\nThe LL is a bit odd, because the top serif
    has no bracketing, but <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/linotype-centennial/\">Linotype
    Centennial Italic</a> is pretty close. If no one finds a better match, you could
    edit out the bracketing and make this look indistinguishable from the original.\r\n\r\n-
