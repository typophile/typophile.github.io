body: Hello! I am a student studying type in a few of my classes.  <BR> <BR>I am an
  InDesign user. I find that it is way more user-friendly than Quark is, and it is
  more efficent to use all Adobe programs. <BR> <BR>However, my school only uses Quark.
  In the past, I&#39;ve been using InDesign in the developing stages, before doing
  the final work on Quark. Yes, that&#39;s how much I can&#39;t stand Quark! <BR>
  <BR>As the workload is increasing &#40;this is my junior year&#41;, it&#39;s getting
  to be too cumbersome to hop between the two programs. <BR> <BR>Is there a way to
  export documents out of InDesign so Quark can open them? Or vice versa? I&#39;ve
  tried to figure out a way, but unsuccessfully. I was wondering if anyone could shed
  light on this.  <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    your Indesign files as PDFs and place them in InDesign if you had to. <BR> <BR>As
    for Quark files, InDesign can open Quark files saved as Quark 4, but not 5 or
    6.

  body: InDesign can open QuarkXPress 3.3 and 4 files. <BR>ID2Q is reportedly less
    than thrilling. If you absolutely have to get InDesign material into QuarkXPress,
    then you shoul dgive it a whirl. But based on user reports on the BlueWorld InDesign
    mailing list, I would not want to make it a regular, ongoing workflow. <BR> <BR>Cheers,
    <BR> <BR>T

  body: It is kind of like converting a Mercedes into a Ford. It is a pain to do and
    the results look more like a Hugo.
