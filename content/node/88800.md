    emailing Foundry about their Gridnik font and recieved no response\"...\r\nI've
    heard this story many times. It is strange that The Foundry is so hesitant to
    sell its stuff. There is no reseller\".\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll try to e-mail them...\r\n\r\nI've
    find this similar one:\r\nhttp://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Graphic+Fonts/Vectrex/\r\n\r\nDo
    you know other ones?\r\n\r\nThank you again.\r\n"
