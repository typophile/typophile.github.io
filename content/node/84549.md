  website <a href=\"http://foto-exclusive.com\">www.foto-exclusive.com</a>. I have
  been approached to design a billboard for the company, but haven't been able to
  get in touch with their original designer.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it was Century
  Gothic, which is very similar but has some vital differences (like, for example,
  the letter 'e').\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks for your help, and here is the example image:\r\n\r\n<img

    if you want something distinctive with a similar e?

    is willing to spend money on commercial fonts. :( About the quality of the used
    font, I'm not going to go there. :)\r\n\r\n@marcox: Thanks!"
