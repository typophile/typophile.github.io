body: "I've recently become interested in creating three dimensional type to include
  in my design work. In school, 3D programs were never offered so we stuck to the
  basics of Freehand, Illustrator, In Design and Photoshop. The kind of 3D type I'm
  talking about can best be illustrated by the work of Nik Ainley, http://shinybinary.com/art.html
  Specifically this image: http://shinybinary.com/images/art/2020visions.jpg\r\n\r\nThere's
  something about the three dimensional type interacting with the various bubbles
  and swashes that really make it pop.\r\n\r\nWhat software is required to produce
  type such as this? I've heard of Maya, 3D Studio Max, etc, but don't know the difference
  between them or which would be best for exporting the type in to Photoshop for best
  edit-ability.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\nJenkin"

  body: "Illustrator can get you most of the way there, especially if you use a little
    Gradient Mesh to take the place of some of the standard gradient fills. Photoshop
    can be used to enhance the Illustrator lettering. Or Photoshop can be used to
    do all of the colouring, once you have paths created in vector software.\r\n\r\nBoth
    methods require 'handwork' though, which can take quite a bit of time depending
    on the complexity of what you're aiming for. Since this is a special effect more
    than a stock solution I would think this suitable myself but there are some plugins
    for both Illustrator and Photoshop I think that can generate 3-dimensional shapes
    on the fly if you don't want to go the whole hog with something like Maya.\r\n"

  body: If you are on a limited budget, but have time to learn, check out Blender
    [ [[http://www.blender.org]] ]. It's a very full featured open source 3d application.
    The UI is a little tricky, but it's very fast once you are used to it. Either
    way, it looks like the 3d app is the smallest part of this work.

  body: "It's been such a long time since I've done this. Extreme 3D had a handy function
    of importing EPS files and using the splines to built its geometry. I think many
    more modern 3D programs have similar functions, either importing some form of
    Illustrator curves or handling text as geometry directly, but I don't know which
    ones.\r\n\r\nOne thing you might find you have to do is to add points to your
    curves before exporting The curves generated by the 3D software are not always
    as supple as in drawing programs, especially when rendering is set in a faster
    mode. The extra points will give stability to the shapes."

  body: "You might want to look into <a href=\"http://www.povray.org/\">POV-Ray</a>,
    a free open-source 3D rendering application that's available for Windows, Macintosh,
    and Linux.\r\n\r\nPOV-Ray is unusual in that you create scenes <em>not</em> by
    modeling them in a GUI application, but instead by describing them in a text file
    using a scene description language (SDL). POV-Ray has direct support for TrueType
    fonts, so you can render extruded 3D text pretty easily.\r\n\r\nFor example, here's
    a scene I threw together in a couple of minutes:\r\n\r\n<code>#include \"colors.inc\"</code>\r\n<code></code>\r\n<code>camera
    {</code>\r\n<code>  location <0, 2, -18></code>\r\n<code>  look_at <0, 0.25, 0></code>\r\n<code>
    \ angle 15</code>\r\n<code>}</code>\r\n<code></code>\r\n<code>light_source {</code>\r\n<code>
    \ <500, 500, -1000></code>\r\n<code>  White</code>\r\n<code>}</code>\r\n<code></code>\r\n<code>text
    {</code>\r\n<code>  ttf \"frutbd.ttf\" \"Typophile\" 1, 0</code>\r\n<code>  pigment
    { SlateBlue }</code>\r\n<code>  translate -2.3 * x</code>\r\n<code>}</code>\r\n\r\nThis
    produces the following image:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_POV-Ray_4785.png]\r\n\r\nNote
    the full alpha transparency. This makes it a snap to drop rendered scenes into
    Photoshop layers.\r\n\r\nDon't be intimidated by the whole SDL thing. If you all
    you want is simple extruded text, you don't even really have to learn the language.
    You can just play around with the parameters in the script I posted and see what
    comes out. Later on, if you're feeling adventurous, you can start to read the
    <a href=\"http://www.povray.org/documentation/\">documentation</a> at your own
    pace; eventually, you'll be able to come up with a lot of different cool effects."
