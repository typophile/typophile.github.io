  know I love it, but...\r\n\r\n...is it just me or does anyone else find that the
  colour used for links in text on typophile.com is not far enough away from black
  to be particularly helpful? I often really struggle to quickly locate a link in
  text even though I know it's there somewhere and have probably even missed some
  that I should have seen.\r\n\r\nI guess I am a fairly typical member - nearly 39
  years old, male (not colour blind), myopic (-2.00 left, -3.25 right).\r\n\r\nI have
  ClearType switched on (and optimised for my eyes). I have a feeling that may not
  be helping but I prefer it to pixelated fonts?"
