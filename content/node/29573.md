  of the trailers was a promo for the Turner Classic Movie channel. The promo had
  a scroll with names of famous actors. Every few names, one of the titles would animate.
  For instance, Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's names crossed each other, there was
  the sound effect of a kiss and red hearts burst forth from their crossing. The type
  from Errol Flynn's name dueled with the type of somebody else's name with the sound
  effects of swords meeting. I thought it was a cute idea.\r\n\r\nAnyone seen this
  promo? Is it available on the internets?\r\n\r\n"
