body: "I am looking for the arrow set that goes with Frutiger or Frutiger Next,\r\nsurprisingly
  it doesn't seem to be part of either font set (unless I am missing something).\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know if the arrows were developed solely for the CDG or are they are part
  of another arrow/font set?\r\nI am particualrly looking for the lighter arrows shown
  in the attached image.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DeGaulle_3_3866.jpg]"
