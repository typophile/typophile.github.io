  2 different logo fonts, it would be great if I can get the name of both of them.
  Thanks for the help. \r\n\r\nThe alternative one is in their video; I've included
  it in the 3rd attachment"

  body: "Can't find a match for the first one but having a look to any font \"bauhaus
    related\" would be good. Could also be a freebie. As it's very geometric, you
    could also consider to redraw it using only a circle (q is o with a descender,
    u is o's half down part with 2 ascenders, i is a bar, r is o's top left quarter
    with a descender, k is a 2 back to back half o with an ascender and y is u with
    a half o as loop...).\r\n- http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html\r\n-

  body: "@Ryuk:\r\nThanks a lot for the help, I only have a few fonts on the list
    you've made on my computer but like you've stated the logo font could be replicated
    easily. \r\n\r\nThanks for the reference links, I'll try to mix and match to recreate
    it (although redraw is probably faster)\r\n\r\nThe second link is the same logo
    as the 1st one just with a different border and not slanted, I'll fix it in a
    moment."
