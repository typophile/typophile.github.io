  inspired and appreciate typography, My audience is 4-16 year olds. My aim is to
  try and inspire 4-16 year olds to appreciate typography and possibly enjoy it more.
  I've done some secondary research into my age range and have even tried to make
  typography attractive via means of colour and shape but i'm not really getting much
  feedback when i approach people who stop and look. I was wondering if anybody may
  have some helpful suggestions or advice?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/__5235.jpg]"
