body: "I am a graphic design student graduating in a few months. My class is putting
  on an end of the year show. Lissitzky is my hero and gretest influence. My thesis
  idea is to re-create Lissitzky's prounenraum with posters with type instead of his
  sqares and rectangles. I am having trouble deciding on what type should say. The
  word proun means project of the new, so I want to aproach this the way Lissitzky
  would if he had a computer and CS3. I need this to reflect typography of the 21st
  century and the definition of proun.\r\n\r\nWhat should the type be to connect my
  thesis idea. I am thinking about using either cheeky type sayings. I also thought
  about typesetting popular key commands. What do you guys think about this? Any better
  suggestions for what the type would say. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank
  you!"

    text about the <a href="http://www.ukrainiangenocide.com/">Ukranian Famine</a>
    of the same period? That would be a pretty interesting way to approach Lissitzky.

  body: Thanks, but I really need to try to make this connect with 2008 or the 21st
    century per my professor...that's what's killing me. I can't find the connection..

    proun works and contemporary Jewish art? That might turn up something interesting.
    Check out the library at your local Jewish community center."
