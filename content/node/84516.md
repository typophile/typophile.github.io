body: "I found this type on an architectural floor plan. At first glance, I would
  say it was corrupted, but the font was outlined (as lines, not shapes) and the rest
  of the drawing was fine. Furthermore, much of it seems too deliberate to be accidental.
  Some letters have 3-4 variants within the sample. I am thoroughly confused.\r\n\r\nMy
  apologies for the terrible title. Someone on Twitter suggested it and I rather like
  it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

    maybe a rendering error...perhaps someone was drawing letters in the CAD software
    itself? Or maybe it's a cad file that was converted to another format.\r\n\r\nYour
    post title would be a great name for this font if it is, indeed, a font. "

  body: "That would be my guess too: it looks like a combination of rounding errors
    and path simplification. I've seen similar issues dealing with CAD to Illustrator
    conversions. Here's a [[http://www.cadtutor.net/forum/showthread.php?54092-How-to-draw-an-arc-in-AutoCAD-so-that-it-looks-smoother-in-Illustrator-And-more...|complaint
    on a forum]] that sounds like the same issue:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nI am drawing
    my plans in AutoCAD 2006. After finishing one plan, I open it in Adobe Illustrator
    CS3. \r\n\r\nBefore opening in Adobe Illustrator, I flatten all splines to polylines.
    Also I don`t have single arcs but polylines consisted of lines and arcs.\r\n\r\nBut
    in Illustrator this arcs from polylines are not smooth. \r\nArc becomes fractured
    in few segments whit corners.\r\n</blockquote>"

  body: Thanks for the feedback. I guess this is my next project. As much as the letters
    offend me, they also intrigue me in ways I rather wish they wouldn't...
