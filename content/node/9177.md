body: I&#39;ve become obsessed with finding and printing specimen books, the more
  designed the better, but not many foundries offer much in the way of well designed
  .pdf examples. Can anyone point me at some great examples of specimens meant to
  be printed on a color laser printer?

  body: Stefan Hattenbach has produced some very nice PDF specimens for many of his
    faces found at his <a href="http://www.macrhino.com/">Mac Rhino Foundry</a> site.
    Because of the Flash-based site, you have to dig around the navigation a bit to
    locate and download them. <BR> <BR>The PDFs produced by <a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=fonts">Underware</a>
    are always a treat - but the recent <a href="http://www.underware.nl/download/auto/pdf/stick-out-your-thumb.pdf">Stick
    Out Your Thumb</a> piece for their Auto family is absolutely priceless.

  body: 'What does one put in a spec book? <BR> <BR>At the one extreme, it&#39;s more
    specification than specimen, and that&#39;s the strtategy I followed here, 26
    pages showing permutations of tracking at different sizes for all the Bodoni Egyptian
    family members, text  block settings with different leading at a range of sizes,
    as well as full character complements of each font. &#40;My inspiration was the
    old Alphatype CRT system spec sheets, c.1980, which I found to be most useful
    back in tha day.&#41; But it&#39;s so much work, I&#39;ve only ever finished this

    van Blokland automated the whole procedure, of course, when he was producing the

    specimen pamphlets of Adobe Garamond, Minion and Utopia, designed by Jack Stauffacher,
    Fred Brady, are very nice, kind of classics, though I have zillions of specimen
    books in my library. <BR>Jordan
