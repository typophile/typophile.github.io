  body: kimper - this looks proprietary &#40;&#42;guessing&#42;&#41;,  <BR>but Noodle
    Script &#40;Dave Bastian&#41; <BR>and League Night &#40;House Industries&#41;
    <BR>have the same flavor, but a little <BR>more weight. <BR> <BR>Maybe Dinctype
    might have something similar.

  body: This is a pretty remarkable story, actually. I was going  <BR>to post something
    about it at <i>Typographica</i> one of  <BR>these days. This is a freebie from
    West Wind Fonts.  <BR>Rare to see a publication with a massive design budget  <BR>like
    Martha&#39;s go to the freeware bucket. I think it says a  <BR>lot about the improving
    quality of free/shareware stuff.  <BR> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/westwind/"
