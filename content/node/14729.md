  body: ah sorry, i meant the blackletter. I think several foundries had it in metal...
    It's in Linotype's [[Big Red]]. And no, Rich doesn't keep me in a cave... just
    in the attic.

    Or at least, there is no licensable version of it from any commercial foundry.
    (But I'm unaware of any free varieties either)."

    point out that Cloister Black is a pretty close adaptation of Caslon Text, and
    there are a lot of digital versions of Cloister Black.\r\n\r\nI have a slide or
    scan that compares the two, if that is of any help.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
