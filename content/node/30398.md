  are few monoline, semi-casual, connected scripts out there I believe this font could
  fill a gap.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase is still rough, but so far it is looking promising.\r\n\r\nI'm
  planning on including OpenType features such as ligatures, swashes, and alternates.\r\n\r\nAny
  comments?"

  body: "It looks good! But as you might experienced it's very difficult to connect
    letters with round terminals without overlap. With the use of ligatures you can
    both avoid this problems and add a more idiosyncratic look to the typeface.\r\n\r\nJust
    an idea.\r\n\r\nDino"

  body: "Dino, I am planning on making ligatures, but I have not fully thought out
    the game plan yet. \r\n\r\nI figure as long as the paths are all the same direction,
    overlapping shouldn't be too much of an issue. Someone correct me if I'm wrong."

  body: "Overlapping has got to be the soul of script fonts. There's nothing wrong
    with it in my estimation.\r\nCritiquing, then--\r\n-the a seems a little malformed
    when inside of a word. I think it's that the bowl is tilted less than the stem.\r\n-n
    probably too wide.\r\n-The little loop in b, o, w, and v ought to be similar,
    but if you don't want them all identical (after all, it is a handwriting font),
    at least change the loop on the o. It's too small, so it shows up as a large glob.
    Either make it bigger like the b's or close it like the v's.\r\n-outstrokes on
    u and x don't flow as well as the others.\r\n-possibly the top of c could come
    farther right, and maybe open e up some?\r\n-the right stem of the y should be
    more like the u's.\r\n\r\nThis is very precise and nice, and it must have been
    tough to think at times with such a steep slant, but you seem to have made it
    work nonetheless very well. Good job on this."

  body: "Thanks for the crit, No.3.\r\n\r\nI had the same thoughts about the o's loop.
    I'll probably make it a bit smaller so it closes up. On thicker weights, it would
    have closed up anyway.\r\n\r\n"

    scripts that flow beautifully.\r\n\r\nIt looks 'formal' but not too stiff. Lots
    of ligatures will make it more convincing - especially when duplicate characters
    appear together.\r\n\r\nI've just completed an OT script with a few features,
    so get in touch if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
