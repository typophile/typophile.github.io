  A bit like  Torture stitches (see link below) but cleaner and more precise with
  more lines. Any recommendations?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/278462/TortureStitches-product.html"

    vaguely remember something like that, but it could be an optimistic false memory.
    If you don't find something close enough to what you need, what are the chances
    you might commission a bespoke font?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    (along with "font") would turn up something.
