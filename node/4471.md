  I dont like it but I am not sure if I dont like it because its for me considering
  we are our worst critics so I was wondering what you thought about it or if you
  can make any modifications of ideas youve, feel free. I was thinking in making it
  a lil stronger... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/34336.gif"
  alt="Logo"> <BR> <BR> <BR>Its for a Wireless Internet Service Provider Red means
  Network in spanish and the W stands for Wireless.

  body: Hi Benjamin, I&#39;m also new here. Seems like a nice place. <BR> <BR>I think
    the logo has potential, I like how the connected cells make up a W, perhaps the
    strokes should be slightly thicker as it could cause problems at low resolutions.
    Also I&#39;m not keen on the typeface, I think it needs something stronger to
    go with that logo, maybe a really simple sans serif?

  body: 'Benjamin - <BR> <BR>I like the icon form you have created - but it seems
    to be working against the typeface you have chosen.  Perhaps something that compliments
    the round shapes in the icon a bit more?  I do appreciate the fact that the word
    &#34;Red&#34; is presented in the color blue. <BR> <BR>::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::
