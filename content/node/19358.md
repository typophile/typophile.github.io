  body: "I was using the Enumclaw Starbucks every day for a week recently. I was so
    happy that a city with a name like that would have a Starbucks. I would have had
    big-time internet withdrawals if it weren't for that hotspot. Very pretty area.\r\n\r\nYou'll
    probably recognize some of the photos I took around there:\r\nhttp://www.fontplay.com/freephotos/landscape.htm\r\n\r\nThe
    three on the right of the fifth row down are a little lake I walked around there."
