  in FontLab, no glyph is showing. It does show its characthers in FontBook though
  (Macintosh) and if I install it, it will be placed in font folder of Classic OS.\r\nIs
  it possible to convert it to TTF font and view its glyphs in FontLab? How?\r\nThanks,\r\nBehnam"

  body: which file are you trying to open with FontLab? you should be able to open
    the pfb file which will give you all the character information.

    font formats other than TTF. In the Info it says it's Type1 PostScript.\r\nI couldn't
    send attachment directly to you. If you contact me, I'll reply with a sample of
    those fonts."
