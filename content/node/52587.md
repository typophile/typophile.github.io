body: "Hi all let me introduce myself. \r\nMy name is simone (but i am known as simsy
  to my friends) was born in a place called melbourne australia but i now reside in
  the United kingdom with my partner and his dog chloe... you are most likely wondering
  the hows whys and whatfors about me so here it all is (or an abbrevated version
  at the very least).\r\n\r\nI am a lover of typefaces (which is a recent aquired
  obession.)and abstract art (i am an amater abstract artist i have no formal graphic
  design/art training whatsoever) \r\n\r\nI know you are wondering why am i obessed
  with typefaces,well fonts can express so many emotions, express a viewpoint or even
  just be plan fun. \r\n\r\nAnd thats why i love typography. It can express many moods,
  it can be formal or informal.. its just that versitile and if its well done a font
  can stand the test of time.. like sands though the.. \r\n\r\nsorry i had a days
  of our lives moment there (an old american soapie for those who had no idea about
  the reference)\r\n\r\nanyway this is my blog, sometimes about fonts, sometimes about
  art...\r\nand maybe just maybe sometimes about something totally unrelated to the
  world of art and typography.\r\n\r\nPeace out\r\n\r\nSimone"
