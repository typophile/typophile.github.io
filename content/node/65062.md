body: "I understand that \"Nodes at Extremes\" are a necessary part of hinting. \r\n\r\nAnd
  though I do NOT understand the subtleties of hinting (I just click F7) putting nodes
  at extremes has broadly become the way I  draw most curves anyway.\r\n\r\nWhen my
  glyph has a broad curves at the extremes or corners that turn at the extremes, everything
  is honky dory...\r\n\r\nBut things don't always work out that way:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nodes01_4376.gif]\r\n\r\nWhen
  I put nodes at the extremes of tiny curves (like in A,V and W glyphs with diagonals
  that have rounded edges) the curve gets wobbly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nodes02_6458.gif]\r\n\r\nDo
  I need to turn my UPM up to 2000 to handle the fidelity for these fine curves? \r\n\r\nOr
  can I just not worry about it and let my nodes just be really close to the extremes
  in those few cases?\r\n\r\nI DO plan to generate both OT type 1 and Truetype eventually...

  body: Tiny curves don't need it and don't gain anything by it. Best practice is
    to put curve quality first and trust your common sense.

  body: "That is the approach I would like to take...\r\n\r\nBut I read somewhere
    that OpenType TT needed points on all the extremes or it had problems.\r\n\r\nIs
    that not so much the case?"
