  [[Building Letters]] project continues! An international team of typographers, designers,
  and editors vivified the idea to publish this magazine. The Building Letters 3 would
  raise money to help those affected by the Asian Tsunami in 2004, an event which
  dominated the news for such a short time, but where people still need our help,
  long after the cameras have gone home.\r\n\r\nThe integral part of the magazine
  is a CD containing free fonts. The main reason to include a CD is to make the magazine
  more attractive for those who buy it. Not only they receive a magazine, but also
  some added value they can use in their own projects.\r\n\r\nThe last issue of Building
  Letters, published by [[Jim Richardson]], contained a CD with 30 fonts by various
  designers ([[Max Kisman]], [[Neville Brody]], [[Emigre]], etc.).\r\n\r\nPlease help
  us to make BL3 project successful. We need to create a valuable collection of fonts.
  If you wish to participate, please contact me at filip@designiq.cz. Every participating
  designer will have his/her own folder on the CD; the folder should contain PC and
  Mac version of a font (OT fonts preferred) and it could also contain EULA and/or
  catalog in PDF.\r\n\r\nThank you for helping us, and the victims.\r\n\r\n[[Filip

  body: Filip, I added this to the news forum. I think more people probably use the
    RSS feed for it that this one.

    thing that has all the \"Fleurons of Hope\" in it or is that another thing? Since
    I have a couple of fluerons in there, why not a type as well.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
