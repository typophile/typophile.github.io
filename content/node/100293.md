    company as design is not their main business, but a printer may be able to suggest
    local designers.  And if any local businesses have nice logos, ask them for the
    name of their designer. \r\n\r\nTalk to several designers, look at their portfolios
    (especially their logos), get written estimates, and ask for the names of recent
    clients you can contact to ask how the jobs went."

  body: "@5star... my intention was, indeed, to provoke a dialogue about how \"snarky\"
    certain people get about a small foundry/outlet such as Lost Type, or 10 Dollar
    Fonts, etc... the choice of the font or artwork is not the designer's choice,
    nor really even the client's... there is a \"natural\" voice that is wanting to
    come out... and the designer/consultant/client and potential customer need to
    come together to listen to that natural voice...\r\n\r\nAnd to answer your \"snarky\"
    question about what it is that I do not do: in a previous life, I worked on creating
    and expanding technology transfer laws and institutions throughout the world.
    Later, I became the chief economic strategist for German Reunification and a counselor
    to the Holy See. And now, have settled down to establish a new paradigm of global
    socio-economics. You can read our free ebook here: www.wealthbeyondnations.com
    (which by the way, was not very well set, typographically... the 3rd edition,
    hopefully, will be much better)\r\n\r\nI just happen to appreciate typography
    (both the art and its economic relationships). (and I like to stimulate dialogue

    a kreel.\r\n\r\nShane:\r\nHire a local graphic designer. Make sure your contract
    has a schedule, shows how many rounds of revisions, and perhaps has a option to
    kill the deal built into it. It should explicitly state deliverables, which include:
    Brand standards guide (can be very simple, specifying logo use, colour way, type
    specification), logo files in all necessary forms (vector, raster, B&W, colour,
    etc), and anything else you think is needed (ie: it could include a series of
    icons or illustrations that work together). You are pretty much buying a toolset
    for communicating with the world, and for persuading people in the world to give
    you money. \r\n\r\nGet references from other businesses in your area. \r\n\r\nYou
    may like to find a designer who knows what flyfishing is (that will speed up the
    process) and thus won't offer you clip art of a pike eating a treble-hooked thing.\r\nBest

    never just \"buy a logo\", even if it's from a good designer, because a logo is
    only seen by clients when it's in use on something \u2014 a letterhead, business
    card, website, flyer, or whatever, and you'll end up with a nice logo slapped
    on a series pieces that are poorly designed and don't communicate well.  The designer
    should not only create a logo but design the stationery, website, and related
    marketing materials.\r\n"

  body: "And how many clients did you get through the local chamber of commerce?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    an answer for #2 please.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that tmac is trolling.
    What he said is what any \"local designer\" <em>wants</em>, but it doesn't really
    align with the interests of a vast majority of potential clients. In order to
    select \"local\" over \"non-local\" there should be a clear benefit to doing that.
    A benefit that is absolutely bloody obvious to the client. And the way things
    stand there is no such benefit, especially not for those who look to design a
    one-off logo.\r\n\r\nThe branding is indeed a face of a company, so picking a
    designer is a substantial commitment and it comes with an inherent risk of making
    the wrong choice. The way to lessen the risk is to look at designer's portfolio
    and \"How I work\" section. This is what matters. If the designer happens to be
    local, it's just an icing on the cake, but it's hardly <em>the</em> selection
    criteria.\r\n\r\nSo the most sensible way to go about picking a designer for a
    project is to flip through their portfolios. And the simplest way to do that is
    to skim through sites that serve as portfolio aggregators - Behance, Dribbble
    and Logopond.\r\n\r\n\"Sheesh.\""

    I review my work it's 75% local. Maybe it's old fashioned but there is a benefit
    for a regional client to have a regional designer as they will have a better understanding
    of the cultural milieu. The OP is distinctly regional; it's not fishing charters
    in Belize for international clientele.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are examples showing
    the opposite. Such as Old Faithful (which, Apankrat, you probably know of). And
    the proprietor there, he did just as you said -- skimmed portfolios until he saw
    what he liked, which happened to be in Austin. The distinction is that this proprietor
    has a refined sense of what he wants his business to look like. \r\n\r\nAnyway,
    regional vs non-regional/international: this could go on forever and not be entirely
    fruitful. Over n out.\r\n\r\n"

    meet up somewhere. And if the local designer has any skill at all it will show
    within a short period time, usually through the designer's on the spot thumbnail
    sketches. And, if the designer is worth their salt the designer should have contracts
    at the ready. I always ask for a retainer (local or global). It gives me a means
    to clear the client's quality of intent, and it allows me to purchase typeface/fonts
    needed.\r\n\r\nThe thumbs always settle the matter.\r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: ">In order to select \"local\" over \"non-local\" there \r\n> should be a
    clear benefit to doing that. \r\n\r\nPicking a local designer can have several
    advantages.  I think you can size up a person better when you meet them in person
    and look them in the eye, rather than through an email. A local designer may have
    local references you can check, which may include people or businesses you know
    personally. A local designer can meet the client and see their business in person,
    which can help them get a better feel for both. It's much easier for a local designer
    to design signage (which often requires making mockups and judging in person how
    they look), and can personally inspect the signage when it's delivered. A local
    designer can work with a local print shop, meet personally with the printer's
    rep, and do a press check while the jobs are being printed. A local designer may
    have a good working relationship with local newspapers and other media outlets
    where the client may want to advertise. \r\n\r\nAnd frankly it's easier to put
    a little pressure on a designer who's slacking off when you can physically walk
    into their office. \r\n\r\nI'm not saying that working with an out-of-town designer
    is bad; it's quite common and often works out well.  But there are advantages
    to working with someone local."
