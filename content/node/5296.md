  bother posting this if it weren&#39;t for this: My girlfriend went to see the movie
  with her brother, and when she returned she commented on how she liked <i>the typeface
  they used for the end credits</i>! <BR> <BR>I was so proud! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>So she asked me what typeface it was, but I have
  no idea.. I don&#39;t want to disappoint her, so here&#39;s my question: Did anyone
  catch the movie and can you remember the end credits?'

  body: I did see the movie and I wondered this myself. The typeface is first seen
    on the Mirauder&#39;s map. and the end credits take cue from that. I was reminded
    of Poetica, but it was distressed and Poetica is not.  <BR>

  body: To me it looked like a custom version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/nicolas-cochin/"
    target="_blank">Nicholas Cochin</a>. I was very impressed that the main credits
    appeared to be hand-lettered. Once they got into the thousands of other people
    who worked on the film, it&#39;s clearly type, with some alternate characters
    thrown in liberally. My guess is that is was one or more custom fonts and quite
    a bit of calligraphy.  <BR> <BR>&#40;I quite enjoyed the Mirauder&#39;s Map-inspired
    end credits which twisted and turned as if it was a pop-up map designed by M.C.
    Escher. The type treatment was fun, too.&#41;
