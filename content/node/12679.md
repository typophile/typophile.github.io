body: Hi. I'm pretty sure that the "Sitellite" part is a outline-modified version
  of Officina Sans. What I would like to know is which font, if any is the 4.0. Of
  course, it would be easy enough to recreate these numerals for my friend, but he
  is interested in using the actual font for more work.
