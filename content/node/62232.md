  body: Of course Archer is a girl. The goal was to create a feminine slab serif,
    which is a contradiction in itself. Since the good people at H&FJ did it, it was
    a success nonetheless, if only by adding curlies to make sure. ;-)

    \u2013 do you really think so?\r\nIn my book, \"feminine\" doesn't *need* to mean

    not in yours especially, but in general it does.\r\nJust search for *feminine*
    or *girl* at MyFonts.\r\nAgreed, there is certainly more to the feminine side
    of Archer than the *curlies*. But isn\u2019t Archer such an unusual slab because
    it looks so... feminine?"
