  body: "I have spent some time looking for this, but couldn't find the exact font.
    I think this is a commercial font, because it looks like it has ligatures for
    the 'tu' and 'ti' combinations. Most amateur freebies don't go to that trouble.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    hand-drawn fonts are too numerous to have a good chance of locating the identical
    one, so I suggest finding anything similar. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/casino-hand/?refby=bowfin|Casino
    Hand]] from MADType is a good realistic OTF font that is fairly similar.\r\n\r\n-
