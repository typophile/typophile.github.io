body: "  I need help figuring out the font for the 2 fonts in this logo?  Of course,
  it was passed to me by someone else who worked on the design, and they wouldn't
  respond or send an .ai file or anything for me.  I tried searching online and all
  of my fonts, but I cannot find  the exact font.  I have some similar fonts, but
  my customer wants the same type.  Anyone know the typeface for both, or anything
  that could possibly be pretty close?  Much appreciation and *huge* thanks to anyone
  who knows!!\r\nthanks!![img:sites/default/files/old-images/HudsonGourmetinitialLOGO_4691.png]"
