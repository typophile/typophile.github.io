body: This image has an awesome feel to it. The continuation of the letter makes you
  feel as if the text is vibrating. Your eye follows the different directions of the
  lines. The colored rings bring your focus to the middle. It is an interesting example
  of typography being used to form the image. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/1968poster_4166.jpg]
