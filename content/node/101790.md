  body: Firstly thought it could have been a bespoke typeface exclusively done for
    ESPN The Magazine. Found 2 similars [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/atrament|Atrament]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pagan-sharp/malleable-grotesque|Malleable Grotesque]].
    Gave up twice. Finally, found [[https://www.playtype.com/index.php?q=node/331|Aveny]]
    and looks quite matching everything (part of /G).
