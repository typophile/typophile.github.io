body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI need some help with converting font files. I have the .afm
  and .pfb files for the font Utopia, and am trying to covert it to a form I can actually
  use, preferably Open Type. I'm hoping to find way to convert them for free--I'd
  really rather not pay for a conversion program or anything.  Also, I'm running Windows
  Vista.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated!"

    the .pfb and (sic!) the .pfm file. Right-click on the .pfm file and select \"install\"
    (IIRC).\r\n\r\nAndreas\r\nPS: If you don't have the .pfm file you probably don't
    have a valid license to use the font. \r\n"

    Type 1 version of Utopia</a> that was donated by Adobe to the TeX Users Group,
    which does not include the .pfm files needed by Windows. There are some utilities
    that can convert afm to pfm... Proxima's <a href=\"http://www.proximasoftware.com/afmtopfm/\">AfmToPfm</a>
    might be one to try since it's free.\r\n\r\nConverting to OpenType could probably
    be done with <a href=\"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/\">FontForge</a>, if you're
    willing to invest the time installing it under <a href=\"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/ms-install.html\">cygwin</a>
    and poring through the documentation. On the commercial end, both <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/\">TypeTool</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/\">FontLab</a>
    can import afm files inside the metrics panel, and then generate an OpenType font."

    OpenType versions. It will save you a lot of hassle and may be cheaper on the
    whole.

    you also have the inf file, put afm, pfb and inf into the Windows Vista font folder.
    I don\u2019t know, if it works under Windows Vista, but in case of Windows XP
    the pfm file will be automatically generated then. If you don\u2019t have an inf
    file (that\u2019s a small and simple text file only), have a look into the inf
    file of another font and create an inf file for your font.\r\n\r\nAnd use \"ABF
    Rename PostScript Type 1\" for the case, that there are disharmonies between the
    internal font names: http://fontworker.freeservers.com/abfr104.zip"

  body: "@ Fontgrube\r\n\r\nI had learned in Latin, that it means \"So (vorgefunden)\"
    in German. If it would mean both \u2013 \"So vorgefunden!\" and \"So ist es richtig!\"
    \u2013 it would be relatively senseless. As you said, \"sic\" is the short form
    of a whole term. Theoretically it could mean everything, from \"So regnerisch!\"
    till \"So abgefahren!\". However, if there was a teacher, in whose knowledge I
    in most cases were willing to trust, then it was my Latin teacher. Hehe, probably
    because the things, that I was not able to learn, were most impressive."

    that the quoted/referenced text is that way in original and contains an error,
    obsolete or unusual expression. Here, sic is not used as a comment to one's our
    words.\r\n\r\n<em>Addendum:</em> sic is not a short way for an expression, it's
    just the Latin word for thus/this way (assim in Portuguese, as\xED in Spanish,
    ainsi in French)."
