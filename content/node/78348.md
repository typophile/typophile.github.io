  the font and wanted to use it for display purposes, but I obviously have no clue
  how to get it if I don't even know what it called.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate it if someone
  cold identify this for me, sorry if this proves to be difficult and thanks for those
  of you who take the time to help me out, I appreciate it greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ping_5301.jpg]"
