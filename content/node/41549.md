  body: "The language drop-down controls dictionary and hyphenation options. In a
    few cases, such as this one, it also dictates which composition engine gets used.
    Unfortunately, The standard way to get Chinese support is to buy the Chinese version
    of InDesign, or at least one of the east Asian versions.\r\n\r\nThat being said,
    there are workarounds. See:\r\nhttp://www.adobeforums.com/webx?14@@.3c055868/0\r\nhttp://www.techart.com/downloads/\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"
