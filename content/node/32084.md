  designing a software manual. Is there a font with the keyboard command characters?
  That is, the \u201CCommand\u201D symbol, \u201COption\u201D symbol, etc? Any help
  would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

    used for the menu bar and menus) included those characters. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/chicago/\">Chicago</a>
    was the original, although who knows if the version for sale there contains the
    special characters from Apple's original. You might also look for those characters
    in Veritas, Espi Sans, Truth, or Charcoal.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how it's done
    on OSX."
