body: "[Not sure which forum this is best to post to]\r\n\r\nFor a flyer I need the
  kanji for Reiki: \u970A\u6C17\r\nI started out with Adobe's beautiful Kazuraki,
  which is rather unbeatable in the overall context. However, it does not contain
  the \xAB<a href=\"http://nuthatch.com/kanji/demo/970a.html\">\u970A</a>\xBB kanji.
  So I've tried to put this together in Illustrator. \r\nThe top \xABrain\xBB radical
  is based on the \xAB<a href=\"http://nuthatch.com/kanji/demo/96fb.html\">\u96FB</a>\xBB
  glyph; for the bottom part (which is not a radical), I figured the structure is
  similar to the bottom-most part of the \xABmetal\xBB radical (\xAB<a href=\"http://nuthatch.com/kanji/demo/r167.html\">\u91D1</a>\xBB)
  with the vertical stroke doubled, so that's what I've tried to reproduce.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/reiki_kanji_herleitung_4632.gif]\r\nBefore
  I do much more refining, I'd be really grateful if someone could confirm if this
  makes sense in terms of stroke order, and/or if it's legible / looks OK? (I took
  an intro to Japanese at university, so I have an idea of how to write kanji, but
  it's really too basic for \xABextrapolating\xBB calligraphy.) "

    but I think the top horizontal line probably shouldn't be touching the two verticals
    at the bottom and should probably also be narrower.  The proportions between the
    two elements seems a little off. Here's a less-simplified version that I've used
    in another project for comparison:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Reiki-t_5936.png]"

    (The top one below the \xABrain\xBB radical.) The one that is there is supposed
    to be the one below it\u2026 :-\\ Thank you very much for the eye. I'll report
    back with a revised version hopefully tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTakeshi: Thanks for the
    examples! I did look at a few other fonts, however Kazuraki is so very simplified/reduced
    that I have trouble \xABextrapolating\xBB how this would be designed in its specific
    context.\r\n\r\n"

    the Kaku Gyo or Manyo Gyosho samples above. Note that the Manyo Sosho sample above
    is based on a different construction of the bottom radical, closer to that of
    the original \u9748.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick mock-up of the sort of construction
    I would use:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spiritkanji_6405.png]"

    Kazuraki is so blobby and loose. Not that I have a better suggestion.\r\n"

  body: "Kazuraki does give that loose vibe, but when you look at the individual kanji
    the basic stroke skeleton is quite well respected. When you compare the same passage
    set in a true sosho and Kazuraki side by side it would be more evident, I think.\r\n\r\nWhat
    Kazuraki does simplify is horizontal arrays of simple strokes ('dots' as we call
    them in calligraphy), as in the top radical for \u970A. The bottom part doesn't
    lend itself quite so well to that type of simplification, though you could probably
    go further than what I did above and make it basically two wide Zs stacked together
    plus the vertical strokes (another thing: vertical strokes seem to resist simplification
    in the Kazuraki style).\r\n\r\nOf course, since Nina only needs the two characters
    \u970A\u6C17 and the Kazuraki \u6C17 has a particularly loose feel, I think she
    has much more room for experimentation."

    listening \u2013 does the new version I'm working on (on the right side) look

  body: "Structurally, it looks correct. The bottom part of the \u970A could use more
    space as it is rather dense at the moment. One of the design features of Kazuraki
    is the huge variation in the relative size of the characters which allows those
    with lots of strokes to breathe. There is no reason for \u970A to be so much vertically
    shorter than the \u6C17 despite stacking more horizontal strokes, so you can enlarge
    the bottom part of the \u970A somewhat.\r\n\r\nThe top and bottom parts of the
    \u970A do not align vertically; the bottom part is shifted too far to the right.
    Kazuraki is designed to be set vertically, and its characters, as free-flowing
    as they are, still respect the central vertical axis.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how
    much looser you can get while making sure that the glyph fits Kazuraki. But as
    I said, if you're only using the two characters so that there's no need to harmonize
    with the rest of Kazuraki, you might experiment with a full sosho structure. But
    you'd need the help of someone who knows more about Japanese sosho calligraphy
    to make sure that it's in fitting with this style of calligraphy (Kazuraki is
    not sosho in terms of kanji structure despite its cursive feel). We don't use
    the character variant \u970A in Korea as far as I know (we use \u9748), so I'm
    out of my depths here anyway."

    structure in this overall direction, but I will try opening up the lower part
    of the \u970A and shifting it left a little (although I would like to maintain
    a slight off-vertical axis to the entire word, to make it more dynamic). Will
    be back with a new version..."

  body: "A more micro observation about the bottom part of your \u970A is that the
    strokes seem to be packed too densely in the middle. The part where two 'dots'
    lie on either side of the two vertical strokes (the two dots form a horizontal
    stroke here since it's a fast hand) is much narrower than the horizontal strokes
    directly above and below. This isn't fatal, but it goes against what one would
    expect based on calligraphic expectations of distributing strokes to achieve the
    optimal interplay of the black and the white. In calligraphy, the 'dots' would
    come right after the part shaped like \u3160, and one would instinctively place
    them to take up a bit of the empty spaces on either side of the vertical strokes.\r\n\r\nLook
    at how this part is treated in the examples of the character SATG posted above.
    The two 'dots' are quite prominent in each case. Roughly, you would expect the
    bottom half of \u970A to fill out a trapezoid.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that an
    off-vertical axis would make the composition dynamic rather than just clumsy.
    To me it would be like an otherwise exquisite western calligraphic composition
    with a wobbly baseline or bad spacing between letters\u2014the misalignment will
    be at odds with the carefully composed forms and proportions at the character
    level. A wobbly baseline could suggest dynamism for truly carefree fast handwriting,
    not ornamental copperplate calligraphy. And don't let the flowing strokes fool
    you: Kazuraki represents a finely tuned style of calligraphy, in Western terms
    closer to copperplate calligraphy than freehand scribble."

    the Kanji in the [[http://typophile.com/node/78321#comment-448714|second post]]?
    I've been searching in vain, but I can't find the font that has the same quality
    of brush strokes. I just love how the "ki" strokes are bold and connected, without
    any degradation to legibility.
