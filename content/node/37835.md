    it is less problematic to control my system fonts through Font Book, while I manage
    all of my other fonts through Font Explorer Pro.\r\n\r\nFirst I turn FEX off so
    the changes I make will be reflected when I open it again. Then I open Font Book
    and make a new set adding the fonts which <em>can be</em> deactivated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/canbedeactivated_5297.png]\r\n\r\nI

    because I'm a control freak and want to see what I've done in Font Book reflected
    in FEX I create a new folder and two new sets adding the active system fonts to
    one and the deactive to the other. This also gives me numbers to compare if any
    new fonts get added next time I install software.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mysets_6289.png]"

  body: I would never replace the system version of Helvetica or Helvetica Neue. I
    tried that a while ago and it only caused problems. I've had to learn to work
    around it. I do have one client who uses Helvetica and so I find myself activating
    a only a few non-system Helvetica fonts and dealing with the situation.

  body: "Here's how I personally set up my Mac....\r\n\r\n/System/Library/Fonts/\r\nI
    never touch these, they're core fonts for Mac OS X. Application developers generally
    expect these fonts to be present and active. The system will still function for
    some people if they remove some of these, but weird, hard-to-diagnose problems
    can result.\r\n\r\n/System Folder/Fonts/\r\nThis will only exist if  you have
    a PowerPC based Mac with a OS 9 System Folder. When OS 9 runs within OS X it is
    referred to as \"Classic\".  The minimal fonts for Classic are Charcoal, Chicago,
    Geneva and Monaco. I remove everything else. Intel Macs never have this, so people
    are quickly forgetting about it.  \r\n\r\n/Library/Fonts/ \r\nThese fonts are
    technically optional. Personally, I remove most of them. Here are the fonts I
    leave behind: Times New Roman, Arial, Georgia, Verdana, Webdings. These fonts
    are commonly used on the web, and some applications seem to assume they will be
    present. If a website specifies Impact or Trebuchet, the browser will have to
    fall back to something else. The same thing will happen in other apps as well.
    \r\n\r\n/Users/*your username*/Library/Fonts/\r\nThis folder is empty by default.
    I keep it empty, although MS Office will install fonts here. \r\n\r\nOn Helvetica:
    Mac OS X comes with a font called Helvetica, which resides in /System/Library/Fonts.
    If you need to use Helvetica, in my opinion the best thing to do on Mac OS X is
    to uses Helvetica LT Std from Linotype. It has an internal PS font name that is
    different from previous releases, so theres no chance that the system or any application
    will get the fonts confused. "

  body: "With CS 3, Adobe changed their font install procedure--and for the better
    in my opinion. They now install the design fonts into /Library/Fonts/ so they
    will be available to all apps. This is better than hiding them in Application
    Support. Secondly, it appears that the fonts that used to be in /Library/Application
    Support/Adobe/Fonts/Reqrd/, the \"required\" fonts, are now hidden inside the
    app bundle. So, they put the optional fonts in a standard, expected location and
    they hid the fonts you shouldn't mess with. This is good from a support/usability
    perspective. \r\n\r\nAFAIK, you can take the fonts out of /Library/Fonts/ and
    add them to your font manager if you wish. Some font managers will do this for
    you, but it's always nice to know where they come from and where they're going.
    They're wonderful fonts though, so some people like to keep some or all of them
    active at all times. \r\n\r\n"

    Font Book and try to deactivate a font that the OS absolutely needs, Font Book
    simply gives you an alert that it is a system font and you're playing with fire
    if you mess with it. On that basis, you leave it alone and move on. This is what
    happens when you try to mess with Lucida Grande, for example.\r\n\r\nYou can safely
    deactivate the Helvetica and Times .dfonts in Font Book, and enable alternate
    Postscript or OT versions, that's what I did. No sweat.\r\n\r\nOnce all the system-installed
    .dfonts that CAN be deactivated have been, you have the \"minimal\" system configuration.
    For those .dfonts that have been deactivated, there's no reason to trash them--just
    leave them in the system/library/fonts directory \"just-in-case.\" The few megabytes
    of storage they take up won't kill anybody in this age of monstrous hard drives.\r\n"
