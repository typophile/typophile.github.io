  and Light Italic, Regular Italic and Bold Italic)!\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/niramekko/motiva-sans/|Check

    it to my "consider for publication use" album on MyFonts.

  body: Nice! I only wondered why you did not create 'real' ligatures, not the combined
    glyphs they are now. I think that especially in the italic this could make a positive
    aesthetic difference. And perhaps you could fine-tune the fractions, as the fraction
    bar seems too thick to my eye. Just nitpicking..., nice job and nice price too!

  body: "Thanks Marc, glad you like it!\r\nQueneau, I'm with you on the fractions
    bar. And on the ligatures, especially for the italics. I'm adding to my toDo list.
    I didn't think it was truly necessary on the uprights, but the italics can definitely
    benefit from it.\r\n\r\nThank you for the feedback!"
