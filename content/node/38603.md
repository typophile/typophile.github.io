  Wired Magazine (Vitesse, Vitesse Sans, Exchange, Retina Display). Any help would
  be much appreciated.

  body: "Confused about the request for every typeface in the mag. You planning to
    make a mock-Wired for April Fool's? I applaud your early planning.\r\n\r\nThere
    is nothing quite like <a href=\"http://typographica.org/001103.php#exchange-fonts\">Exchange</a>.
    Maybe <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/nimrod/\">Nimrod</a>.
    For Vitesse, consider <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Dispatch\">Dispatch</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Stainless\">Stainless</a>, and <a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Stratum%20OT\">Stratum</a>. We've discussed
    other alternatives <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/33255\">here</a>."
