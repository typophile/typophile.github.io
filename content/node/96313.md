  we should try.\r\n\r\nNick Shinn? John Hudson? Etc.? Others who who know the history
  & how technical word usage has changed over time.\r\n\r\nFor example, the claim
  that:\r\n\r\n<cite>Kerning adjusts the letters closer together (negative spacing),
  tracking adjusts the letters further apart (positive spacing).</cite>\r\n\r\nignores
  the history & development of the use of this technical term. Originally, with both
  foundry type and Monotype, kerning was always a removal of space  between letterpairs.
  -- a saw with foundry type, and casting a kern with Monotype (& probably could have
  foundry-cast type with a kern, don't know if this was ever done).\r\n\r\nThe point
  is that the original notion of kerning always being a negative space was simply
  a technical issue,  hunks of metal were involved. You could add space, but that
  was a different technique.Can't do it with a saw. And in no case (save perhaps Monotype?)
  would you apply positive space to a whole paragraph, just too damn much work.\r\n\r\nAs
  photocomp made inroads, letters were no longer hunks of metal, and the same system
  that provided for removing space between pairs of letters could be used to add space.
  \"Postive kerning\" ceased to be an oxymoron.\r\n\r\nAnd on & on.\r\n\r\nIf Wikipedia
  is to be fixed, it's going to take a bunch of us. Not interjecting our personal
  aesthetic, just accurate, fairly complete description.\r\n\r\nIn the \"talk\" page
  on justification, Wiklipedia says\r\n\r\n<cite>This article has been rated as High-importance
  on the importance scale.</cite>\r\n\r\nand my first comment is\r\n\r\n<cite>This
  article is full of inaccuracies</cite> \r\n\r\nAnyone want to help?"

  body: "TP: - Nicely done! From a position of ignorance, I wondered why you said
    that metal type could only be negatively kerned. Wasn't it possible to spread
    two letters apart? In fact, unless the individual characters were physically altered
    (by removing parts) they could NOT be kerned by moving them closer together. Granted,
    that was the only meaning of the term at the time. I'd suggest saying it something
    like this: \r\n\r\n\"In its original meaning as defined for metal type, a kern
    could only bring letters closer together (negative spacing my modifying characters
    such as A and V so they weren't rectangular), though today it can go in either
    direction. Tracking can similarly go in either direction, though with metal type
    one could only adjust the letters further apart (positive spacing).\"\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't deign to make such a change myself, because I really don't know whether
    I'm right or not.\r\n\r\n- Herb"

  body: "Thomas, one small quibble, and it's probably not for Wikipedia. \r\n\r\nYou
    corrected the Wikipedia copy to <cite>Although digital type sets tighter on average
    than metal type...</cite>\r\n\r\nAll your changes were for the better, I think,
    \ but I'd at least qualify this one. The overall wordspacing with computer comp
    (esp. PostScript > OpenType) is probably tighter then with metal, but the letterfit
    with metal was often tighter. You are of course quite right that letterfit is
    a function of type design.\r\n\r\nWith both Monotype and foundry metal, the presence
    of kerns on some letters meant that type would touch, though not overlap. And
    that meant editors -- those who mark proofs -- when looking at metal, were comfortable
    with \"touching\" letters. When photocomp came along, \"not touching\" became
    the new standard for text settings. For fun, just look at some Penguin books during
    Tschichold's and Schmoller's tenure. \r\n\r\nAs for Linotype -- Over the past
    week, I've been re-reading a couple Nero Wolfe novels.\r\n\r\nThe first, <cite>The
    Mother Hunt,</cite> (1963) was obviously printed letterpress, and just as obvious,
    printed from stereo plates. Too many copies printed for it to have been printed
    from the cast type.\r\n\r\nThe second book, <cite>The Doorbell Rang</cite>, (1965)
    is set in the same typeface. My copy is a first printing, first edition. While
    it is set from the same metal type, I'm 99.44% sure repro was pulled and the book
    printed offset. It has that look, and an (almost) 21.66 pica measure offers another
    clue.\r\n\r\nHere's the point. These were set Linotype, not Monotype. Ignoring
    the problems of certain characters with the linecaster, the letterfit is tighter
    than we usually see today, esp. with the book where repro was pulled, where the
    ink spread is a bit greater.\r\n\r\nThe common \"not touching\" requirement that
    came in with photocomp, even with kerning regularly applied, often results in
    a bit looser letterfit."
