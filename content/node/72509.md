  interest of mine which sadly has not been of great importance in the projects that
  I do for work.\r\n\r\nSo while I have some spare time I'd like to re-educate myself
  and learn how to use it better.\r\n\r\nFor starters I have question about tracking
  and kerning. \r\n\r\nOften when I kern and track some letters, I do it by eye, but
  who knows if I have a good eye for this sort of detail? ;)\r\n\r\nI'm wondering
  are there any good online resources that can show me good kerning/tracking and perhaps
  show me a few do's and don'ts?\r\n\r\nAlso any books perhaps?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    lot of links are in here: http://typophile.com/node/69671 (I'd especially recommend
    going to your library and picking up a copy of 'Letters of Credit'; it did help
    me)\r\n\r\nBriem has some nice tips, too: http://briem.net/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm\r\n\r\nMaybe
    also check out the description of iKern's algorithm here: http://ikern.com/k1/the-tool/\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."

    I'm studying how others have used typefaces in their works.\r\n\r\nHope to be
    able to improve real soon ;)"
