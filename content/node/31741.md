  I want to know your suggestions regarding hardware, softwares, technology and internet.\r\n\r\nIt
  should communicate widely.\r\nIt should be modern ( and it should have that selling
  effect, BUY ME BUY ME).\r\n\r\nI was thinking of FF Max as something very modern.\r\n\r\np.s
  \r\n\r\nRECAP: logotype typeface\r\n       bodycopy typeface\r\n       \r\n\r\n"
