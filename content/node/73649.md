  tweaking it could be special, but I have been staring at it too long and have lost
  my perspective.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "well, that script is pretty cramped and messy. I'm assuming you did that
    by hand so you might want to check out http://www.typedu.org/dynamic/lessons/
    as a reference for where to place the weight of your letters.\r\n\r\nalso, the
    alternating caps or size change (I can't tell which) in the second line, \"to
    join us\", is pretty out of place and distracting. \r\n\r\nother than that, the
    layout looks good. the anchor illustration was a nice choice in the context of
    a wedding. You also might want to think about putting a period after evening since
    the next line is a separate thing. "

  body: "I prefer the first one. I feel like this second one is more of a strain to
    read.\r\nAlso, the typeface in the first one contrasted nicely with the curvy
    lines of the script and the illustration.\r\nThe script and the italic together
    doesn't really work."
