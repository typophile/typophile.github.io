  body: "I imagine James Montalbano at Terminal Design might be able to help you out
    in that department. When I saw James deliver a really interesting and informative
    talk in Toronto about Clearview he had a very detailed presentation with photos,
    samples, and some comparisons between the features and attributes of other typefaces
    also being used for highway signage applications. Although I think a fair bit
    of thatt info might be on the Clearview website. Afterwards James was kind enough
    to leave the PDF on my laptop which was used for the presentation. I'd post it
    but I think I'd have to get permission from James first, I think he posts on Typophile
    if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I have none of my own photos of Clearview
    in use."

    his photos.

    in use along highways in places like Texas.\r\n\r\nEric Stuve maintains the OKRoads
    website at http://www.okroads.com. He also maintains some other roadgeek related
    websites. His road trips cover a really big portion of the Interstate Highway
    system, including many roads in Texas. He recently posted photos of a West Texas
    and New Mexico road trip made during April of 2006 at this link:\r\nhttp://www.okroads.com/roadtrips/wtexas.html\r\n\r\nHe
    hasn't yet organized the trip photos into an easy to navigate page (he's working
    on it). If you click on the Lubbock to Oklahoma City link you'll find a parent
    directory featuring lots of photos, many of which feature roadway signs along
    the entire length of Interstate 27. Much of the northern half of that Interstate's
    signs have been entirely replaced with new ones featuring ClearviewHwy legends.
    Most of the big green signs in Amarillo are set in Clearview. He has other photos
    in the El Paso area where ClearviewHwy appears sporatically on new signs mixed
    in with old ones. The posted photos are not high resolution, but one can easily
    ID the ones set in Clearview.\r\n\r\nOther roadway signs in Texas are kind of
    a pot-luck thing regarding ClearviewHwy. Older signs and storm damaged signs are
    replaced bearing the new typeface. It seems like the Texas Panhandle is getting
    the most aggressive treatment on ClearviewHwy-based roadway sign installations.
    It's even appearing on little street name signs in small blink-and-you-miss-them
    sized towns.\r\n\r\nYou might also want to visit www.houstonfreeways.com. Erik
    Slotboom has lots of high resolution photos of super-highways across Texas, some
    of which feature ClearviewHwy-based signs. His new photo essay of the Marsha Sharp
    crosstown freeway in Lubbock has a couple decent shots of signs set in CV-5WR"

  body: Sorry for the late reply, I didn't see this thread before. Most of the images
    I have are already posted on our <a href="http://clearviewhwy.com">clearviewhwy</a>
    website. I have a few more of ClearviewHwy in use. Contact me directly if you
    still need them. (although I imagine your school project has long been handed
    in)
