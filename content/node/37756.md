  body: "You should be able to find a nice selection of similar styles by searching
    with 1800s or Victorian, for starters. Art Nouveau is also roughly this time period.
    Sometimes 'Antique' will also work.\r\n\r\nThere is one typeface there (FLEURET,
    etc) that resembles Copperplate Gothic. <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=Exposition&producttype=TYP&pricemodel=RM%2CRF\">HF
    Exposition</a> is also roughly this vintage in terms of style\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
