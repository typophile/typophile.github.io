  body: "At Typecon in San Francisco Leonard Otillio and John Downer did a workshop
    on   gold leaf lettering. If I had a project like this on glass, I'd go with leaf
    (gold/silver) since the leaf is on the inside it tends to stand up to the weather
    a little better (but still need touch up).  See this gorgeous image (in progress)
    from the workshop:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/98384746@N00/10804755/\r\n\r\nWhile
    neither of them are from SF, the guilding community is small. They may point you
    a the right direction.\r\n\r\nRandy"
