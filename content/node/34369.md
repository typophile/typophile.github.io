  often pixel sketch initial design ideas but obviously I will do the finished version
  of this logotype as vectors. I was wondering if there is already a font with similar
  letterforms. I thought the R and A would be enough for an ID.\r\n\r\nIt seems too
  obvious not to already exist, but if it does have any originality do you think it
  would be worth developing into a full typeface or have I just reinvented a wheel?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RadarLogotypeTypophile_4070.gif]"

    that i have seen in an old type specimen book and House Industries Chalet the
    70-cut. But this is somewhat more elegant.\r\n\r\nSeb"

    and <a href="http://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?PBasR.html">Base Nine</a>.

  body: "No, this is good I really like it. Don't worry if it's a bit similar, it's
    always going to be similar to something. I really like it tracked out like that,
    it's got a 50's world fair look about it, space travel for civilians, self-cleaning
    kitchens, optimism, but it still looks contemp. and stylish. Nice work.\r\n--N"

  body: "I have to second Nicholasgross on not having to worry about any possible
    similarities to existing fonts. Honoustly, a wheel can only be invented once,
    but it's what you do with the existing idea that can make all the difference.
    Your specimen shows a lot of potential & I for one think it's definitely worth
    further development. I recently wrote a whole text about how innovation is far
    too overrated in my opinion (pretty much everything has been done at least once
    somewhere before) & what makes a true artist is how he/she combines all existing
    elements to a personal & interesting whole. Maybe I wrote the whole thing from
    a kind of selfdefensive position, but mainly because I h\xE0te it when people
    only judge things by their originality (and I don't really like being called creative
    in that view because of a certain connotation the word has gotten by now). But
    I'm drifting off from what I really wanted to say... My conclusion & advice: GO
    FOR IT! ;-)"

    want to send her a relieving note if you haven't done so yet ;-)

  body: "Thanks, everyone, for all the feedback and ID suggestions.\r\n\r\nBit of
    a shame it was all so positive :-/ Criticism is often more helpful.\r\n\r\nChalet
    New York 1970 is possibly the most similar ID suggestion and Asvetic's suggestions
    come close in a few places too. But, yeah, I think there's enough differences
    to make 'Radar' worth developing. If I can find the time.\r\n\r\nNicholasgross
    - I'm glad you got a retro futurist vibe from it. That's exactly what I was aiming
    for with this logotype. It's for branding a chair design which has a 50/60's feel
    about. It's all curves and made from tinted translucent plastic in a range of
    groovy colours.\r\n\r\nAnyone feel like collaborating on this font? I can do the
    vectors and you can do the tedious font work. I guess I envisage 'Radar' as just
    an all caps display font; unless someone want's to try a lowercase.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RadarFontTypophile_3543.gif]"
