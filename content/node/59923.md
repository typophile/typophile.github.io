body: "Just finished an ambigram of my first name last week & made one of my last
  name now. Completely different style, but probably more legible (the top version
  at least).\r\nI still need to perfection the curves somewhat, but it should give
  you a good idea already.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ambigram2_3579.jpg]"

  body: "The top one is much more legible than the bottom one. I read \"LURArJ\" in
    the second one.\r\n\r\nIn the top one, try changing the K/A so that the crossbar
    of the A does not connect to the right leg. It may make the K more K-like. And,
    like you said, the curves need a bit of work (especially in the L/S)\r\n\r\n -

  body: "I guess I should rethink a few letters. It's actually supposed to read Lukacs.
    The c has been mistaken for a r a lot. I've had a tough time coming up with some
    combinations & must've forgotten about legibility along the way. It may not be
    the main goal of an ambigram, but neither should 'mistaken identity' be ;-)\r\nIt
    can be hard to take enough distance from your work to judge it objectively when
    you kn\xF3w what it's supposed to be, but now I know where extra care is needed.
    So thanks for your input."
