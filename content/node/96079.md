  troll act. Obviously your postings are solely for the purpose of making them go
  off at you.\r\n\r\nClearly you are a troll. That\\'s what trolls do, post shit to
  provoke annoyed reactions. Compacta is today\\'s blackletter? That statement was
  bound to provoke a considerable negative reaction.\r\n\r\nIt isn\\'t hard to figure
  out typophilers are suckers for this kind of thing. They admit it on-site.\r\n\r\nSincerely,
  Mr. X\r\n\r\n<em>message entered at Maelhorn.com on September 3, 10:11 am</em>"

  body: True, Hrant, but trolls will be trolls. If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
    baffle them with bullsh*t, my old buddy John McKenna Colwell used to say. It appears
    that Ryan has chosen the latter course. Lucky us.

  body: "I love the ironic self-defeating act of someone responding to a troll while
    trash-talking them? Oh silly internet kids, don\u2019t you change. Thanks to your
    setting the bar of behaviour so low, looking as awesome as Roger Moore in Octopussy
    easier than falling of a truck driven by a baby who\u2019s candy was just stolen
    while s/he is shooting fish in a barrel. And yes, I threw in an 80\u2019s reference
    just to prove that even a 40 year old can beat you at your own game. Now go do
    a Google image search for Jaws, the bad guy from the same movie, and make it your
    Facebook profile picture for 24h before you \u201Cremember\u201D something else.
    Wow. I\u2019ve totally lost track of what/why I\u2019m ranting about. Doesn\u2019t
    matter. Roger Moore still kicks ass.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/octopussy_5146.jpg]"

    my message at typophile, and you were dishonest about it, leaving out \\\"they
    can see through to the bottom of you\\\". I knew you would be dishonest about
    it. I\\'ve seen your face closeup http://obiaudio.com/category/sample-pack/ryan%E2%80%99s-essentials/
    I notice those dishonest, piggy little eyes. LOL!\r\n\r\nI have your home address
    and there\\'s a package in the mail on its way to you. Have you got medical insurance.
    You\\'re gonna need it.\r\n\r\nmessage entered at Maelhorn.com on September 6,
