body: "<strong>// THIS WEEK'S TYPOGRAPHY BATTLE</strong>\r\n\r\nDraw us a new logo!
  Yes, that is right. Typophile is ready to move past the pixel-T, and especially
  the pixel-7. We are looking for not just one amazing drawing, rather a large handful
  that can be rotated on the red square and potentially used in other Typophile promotional
  materials. What better way to show off the talents in this community, than to display
  them proudly in our mark?\r\n\r\nExamples of previous logos:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/black_pixel_3948.png]\r\n\r\n//
  REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n- Draw only the letter T -- it can be uppercase or lowercase.\r\n-
  How you draw it is up to you (vector tools or ink), just as long as the file is
  submitted in the proper format.\r\n- By participating, you pledge that the work
  is of your own design.\r\n- Do not use any fonts or other rights-protected imagery
  (unless you own the rights to the design).\r\n\r\n- Image size: 500 width x 500
  height. 600 dpi\r\n- Color: Black and White\r\n- Format: TIF\r\n\r\n<strong>Judging</strong>
  // [[Punchcut]] will judge the entries, keeping in mind the popularity of the entries
  in the thread. \r\n\r\n<strong>Copyright Retention</strong> // Participants (those
  who submit entries to Typophile) grant Typophile permission to use the artwork/design
  for promotional use, as we see fit, and for applications not limited to the website.
  Participants retain copyrights and Typophile agrees not to sell or transfer our
  usage rights. (In other words, we don\u2019t require exclusive rights, just unlimited
  usage.) \r\n\r\n// ABOUT TYPOPHILE'S TYPOGRAPHY BATTLES\r\n\r\nThis is your chance
  to stretch your type muscles on a weekly basis. You have one week to create and
  submit your entry. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may
  enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout
  the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\r\n\r\nLink

    and upload PNGs for now, but keep in mind that we'll probably want to ask the

    The guidelines specifically say black and white. Why are the red ones and the
    3-color (red, black, and white) ones included? Uneven playing field here.\r\n\r\nB)
    Many of these are designed with a focus on the relationship of the positive and
    negative space on a neutral or white background, which is lost when a black and
    white design (which ultimately would be red and white on a white background, I
    assume) is presented on a black background. We're not getting the full effect
    on a lot of these.\r\n\r\nThis is not to be critical of a good idea, but rather
    to be helpful. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This one is based on the fact that if you take two 1:2 rectangular bites
    out of a square at the bottom left and right, you will get \"the perfect T\" in
    lots of different weights depending on how big the 1:2 rectangle was relative
    to the original square.\r\n\r\nI started messing around with the thickness of
    the stroke of the T's based on the Fibonnacci series since I did a bit of <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/32313\">research</a>
    into how much bolder a bold needs to be to work well with a regular weight. The
    answer on that occasion was about \u03C6 (1.6ish) or \u03A6 + 1 (where \u03A6
    = Golden Section).\r\n\r\nThe first few numbers in the Fibonnacci series are 1,
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144. \r\n\r\nSo on a 144 unit square grid I
    then drew 11 sequential T's as shown with varying stroke thicknesses of 0, 1,
    2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 (the full square). So here are my 12 (just
    10 really) T's altogether.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T500_4224.gif]\r\n\r\nThen
    I thought, what would happen if I animated them? which is when I discovered that
    it behaves a bit like a beating heart.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that the GIF
    file has 22 frames and would probably be better with 20 at 5fps (that would mean
    the heart would beat every second).\r\n\r\nAnyway here are two versions, a mono
    and a blood red version.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beating_T_mono_6034.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beating_T_red_3787.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    might well have another go at this one using Luc(as) de Groot's theory about ac
    = b\xB2 to get 11 basics rather than 12. I might not put a border around it either
    and see how that works."

    It just drives me nuts. In this case, the only attribute of the design is the
    animation so that when it is finally done, there is no more than a plain basic
    T. I think whatever design that you guys choose should be on the merits of a static
    image and not depend on animation to have any impact. I still think Satya's latest
    image is the best one in spite of Concrete's vociferous objections.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: The drawback with the animated GIF (apart from the fact that it's animated
    Chris - none taken!) seems to be that different browsers struggle to play the
    GIF at the speed it should be played at. Mike's Safari is clearly not doign what
    Firefox does...solvable in Flash? I dunno, not an expert. Seems if you look at
    it in Firefox it will be as close as it gets to the right speed. Rock on Firefox.
