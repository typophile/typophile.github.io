  body: "Saya Semi Sans Medium or Bold is fairly close http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontyou/saya-semisans-fy/
    Also Minerva Modern http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/minerva/ and GHEA Narek --
    particularly if the width is compressed to 66% [img:sites/default/files/old-images/GHEANarekBoldAtWidth66Percent_6581.jpg]\r\n
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/armtype/ghea-narek/ Have not been able to find a
    perfect match with a French thick and thin sans with this Art Deco R from circa
    1930.\r\n"

  body: "Washington http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeassociates/washington/ has a
    closer R to ARRIV\xC9E than any of the suggestions so far, and has about the same
    height to width ratio as ARRIV\xC9E , but it is not a thick and thin font. \r\nIf
    the objective is to replicate the letters Washington might be the best candidate
    for editing by thickening some of the strokes. Mighty Tuxedo -- particularly the
    Short Caps http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/mighty-tuxedo-aoe/ is similar
    to Washington as a candidate for editing, but you would have to start with its
    thicker stokes and thin them as required. If the objective is to do a full uppercase
    alphabet suitable for compressed signage like ARRIV\xC9E I would start with Mighty
    Tuxedo.\r\nDon"

  body: "A different approach would be to start with Roxy Medium [img:sites/default/files/old-images/RoxyMedInUse_3814.jpg]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/roxy/ which looks quite similar to  ARRIV\xC9E
    and edit the R to match.\r\nDon\r\n"
