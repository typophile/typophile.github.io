  tried what the font and i've had a good look online. No luck.\r\n\r\nThe font I
  need the name of is within the Brisan Carriages logo at www.brisancarriages.co.uk
  and the \"Carriages\" font.  I think it would be a script font. \r\n\r\nThanks so
  much\r\n\r\nLee"

    the bottom of the _S_ swept to the left.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BrisanLogoTypophile114879b_5682.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/prop-a-ganda/pag-bankas/\r\nAs
    for _Carriages_ the g and s, and perhaps other letters are significantly modified,
    but you could use a script like Amazone which has similar _r_ and _s_ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/amazone/
    or pick a script with all letters but _s_ such as Commercial Script http://www.myfonts.com/search/Commercial+Script/fonts/\r\nPalace
    Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/palace-script/\r\nor Sackers Italian Script
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers-italian-script/\r\nI trust that another
    font detective will post something closer for the script, or perhaps even an exact
    match.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don,\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply. Appreciate it. \r\n\r\nI did think Carriages
    had been modified a lot which is probably why it didn't show up on \"what the
    font.\" Thanks for the suggested scrip fonts I'll have a close look at each one.
    \r\n\r\nWhat's hard is my client wants to use the font for the word \"prestige\"
    and I'm not sure if picking another scrip font would suffice.  I may have to do
    some modifications as well I'm thinking. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nLee"
