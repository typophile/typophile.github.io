  type. My main requirement is to be able to see the font styles so I can make a decision
  whether a block is a ''u'' or an ''n'' for example. There are several others letters
  that can be difficult to discern in some styles when it may be the only block I
  have in that style. The actual name of the font is not that important to me .  I
  have found a couple of font identification sites but they have not been that helpful
  with these old letterpress blocks.  Many thanks '

    the block to a couple of other unambiguous characters, such as a, f, g, etc.,
    and look at the baseline. If you guessed wrong, the difference should be apparent,
    in most cases."

    a good data base of images of fonts that single letters could be compared to? '
