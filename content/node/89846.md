body: "Hagel is my latest typeface. It's still in an early development stage and right
  now I'm focusing more on my grotesque 'Celcius'. Now and then though I work on Hagel.\r\n\r\nThe
  concept is to develop a fairly condensed, clean and modern serif with some classical
  elements.\r\n\r\nHagel v.6: http://www.fichier-pdf.fr/2012/02/12/hagel-v6/hagel-v6.pdf\r\nHagel

  body: "The eye of the italic /e/ should slope down more near the stem I think.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the direction of Hagel is not quite clear yet but I quite like to adapt a few
    Garamond elements. What are your thoughts about an italic /h/ like in Garamond
    with an inward serif on its leg? I want to keep the construction modern though.\r\n\r\nI
    also might have to make the italic h/n slightly wider."

    590px wide max.\r\nAlso, a link to a PDF would make it easier to give insightful
    critiques."

  body: "I will make sure embedded images are no wider than 590px. What \"better results\"
    though? The fact that the images are bigger than the width of this forum?\r\n\r\nWhy
    would a PDF make it easier to give critique though? The images are large enough
    and I even downsized them a bit with html, so if you download them you should
    get them at the original size. I uploaded these big gifs because the Typophile
    uploaders aren't working; otherwise I would've saved myself a lot of time and
    just attach a PDF."

    be printed.\r\nThe images attached feature the letters at the size I design them
    at, namely 200pt. So it should be big enough to see all the details and the resolution
    should be sufficient for printing.\r\n\r\n> And, especially for a text face, letter

    (or printed) hence the PDF.\r\nI know, but with Hagel I'm nowhere near the stage
    where I can make specimens with running text, so for now images/PDFs of the letters
    and occasionally a word set in the type will suffice. Proper text testing will
    come later.\r\n\r\n> I know there are issues in attaching PDFs, but maybe you

    been searching but I can't find a proper website to upload PDFs without them disappearing
    after a while like with most file sharing sites. I need something like photobucket
    for PDF files.\r\n\r\n> FWIW I've found small pdfs (<130K) still work.\r\nUnfortunately
    I can't really get my PDFs to go below 200kb."

    the image in a new tab/window.

    \"o\" and \"b\" a little more condensed, also maybe the serifs can be shorter."

  body: "The links should direct you to the PDF immediately. What kind of issue were
    you experiencing?\r\n\r\nI absolutely hate Dropbox. You have to share a folder
    on your computer which is my first concern. My second concern is that the whole
    procedure takes me too much time. Also, wouldn't I have to invite all of you before
    you can download any files? My biggest concern though is that it literally takes
    4 times longer to upload files than at a random file sharing website. I admit
    that won't be an issue with these 200kb PDFs but I don't want to use a different
    system for different file sizes. I need a reliable all-purpose system, and so
    far I'm actually very satisfied with www.fichier-pdf.fr\r\n\r\nIf you have other
    suggestions I would love to hear it, but Dropbox is really not for me."

  body: I'm having a bit of a dilemma regarding the widths of the letters. As I mentioned
    I want this typeface to be quite condensed. However I also like the idea of a
    humanist serif in a modern jacket, so I would like to at least keep the 'o' rounded
    and the 'H' quite wide. The 'b' could be a little more condensed I suppose. I
    made the 'a' slightly wider as well in v.12.
