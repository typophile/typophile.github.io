body: Can anyone tell me the typeface being used by Citibank in its print ads and
  signage around New York City, the monospaced OCR-style font used for the body copy?
  What is it and where can I get it?

    body: "Thanks William Berkson, OCRK is indeed the answer, and available from MyFonts!\r\n\r\nRe
      health coverage, I'm deciding in the coming months whether to move from HIP
      Prime for $418 a month, with lower co-pays and lower prescription drugs rates
      through the mail, accessed by membership in a nonprofit association, New York
      Artist's Equity, for $75/year membership, OR go through the anal-retentive hassles
      required by the Freelancers Union, including having two or more of your *clients*
      fill out forms...$287 a month, but with higher co-pays and higher drug costs,
      etc. The Freelancers Union is absurdly complicated in its requirements...you
      must *prove* that you are a freelancer...whereas nobody cares when you join
      a nonprofit trade association to get an HMO. "

    must be different from the other monospaced Citibank font, a custom Interstate
    (http://orangeitalic.com/intmono.shtml), right? Those fonts are available from
    Font Bureau (scroll down to the bottom of this page \u2013 http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Interstate/styles)."

    they're great to provide this service. My client was more than happy to fill out
    a brief form and I had the other documents on hand already. It doesn't have to
    be two or more clients, where do you get that?\r\n\r\n$130 is a nice savings per
    month unless you go to the doctor a lot which might drive up the cost in copays.\r\n\r\nI'm
    paying only $185/month and also got the dental."

    \ Even here in \"pay your own way\" Alberta, we shell out $123 a month.  \r\n\r\nFor
    two of us.  \r\n\r\nThat includes things like drugs (there is a small co-pay,
    but we get $125/quarter back), ambulance, psychotherapy, physio, and a bunch of
    other stuff.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted the whole dental et al, we'd pay another $100
    a month for both of us.\r\n\r\nAnd folks wonder why I moved back to the Great
    White North....\r\n\r\nL."

    you each year for the oil profits? (In Ontario the health care costs are paid
