    being able to post without super crazy errors, and maybe moving the start new
    thread link to somwhere where you can actually see it. and not have to scroll
    through EVERY thread to get to it. <BR> <BR>I know the guys are busy, but cant
    we get someone -- I know there are some willing to help them fix these database
    problems.

  body: Be aware that you have to make an appointment to visit the Type Museum in
    Hackford Street, the actual museum is not fully functioning, as most of the exhibits
    are still in boxes and archiving is still going on. There is a treasure trove
    of Bertold Wolpe&#39;s books and machinery some of it from the old Monotype Foundry
    and some donated from other now defunct foundries. Check out the street signs
    in that area. A book shop in Soho that you should visit is on Broadwick Street
    &#40;I think, I normally walk straight there without noting the street names&#41;,
    definitely off Wardour Street. It is not Magma books but does have a selection
    of graphic books at lower prices &#40;probably subsidised by the adult section
    in the basement&#41;. Also check out the bookshop in Tate Modern while you are
    visiting the Design Museum &#40;which can be a disappointing visit for the expense,
    depending on what is showing there&#41;. <BR>Have a good visit. <BR>Tim

    going do you think? <BR>I wasn&#39;t overwhelmed by the Design Museum last time
    I visited a couple of years ago. The bookstore you describe sounds a lot like
    the one I shopped at this summer, thanks for the address.

  body: The staff at the Type Museum are, I believe, all ex-workers from Monotype
    and are enthusiastic and friendly with an in-depth knowledge of technical production
    of type. I think it is well worth a visit. The level of engineering is humbling.
    The Design Museum can be a fruitless experience - I don&#39;t know why, you would
    have thought the opposite. I do recommend Tate Modern though, brilliant use of
    an old power station. The bookshop is also close to Charing Cross Road North which
    has a large selection of secondhand book shops - good for browsing if you enjoy
    that. <BR>Tim

    awfully cheap &#43; It says &#34;Edward Johnston&#39;s original typeface design
    creaated for London Transport in 1961 is a milestone in graphic design and typography&#34;
    <BR>that&#39;s the wrong year &#43; a typo... <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I don&#39;t
