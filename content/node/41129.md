body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI am involved in a local body political party here in Auckland,
  New Zealand. We are looking to make the jump to national politics, and as such are
  mounting a branding campaign. A comrade in the organisation is set on using Franklin
  Gothic on the basis that UK Labour won with it in 1997, and that is used extensively
  by NZ Political Parties. I'm not too keen on this, perhaps simply because everyone
  else does it.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any work on the topic of typefaces used
  in political campaigns? Or better yet can someone suggest some typefaces which aren't
  overused which might allude to our organisation's progressive and socialist roots
  whilst still appealing to as many as possible? The face will be used predominantly
  in print ranging from the logo to body text in pamphlets, aimed at EVERYONE (of
  voting age).\r\n\r\nWe are also looking at translating most of our material into
  Arabic - I know almost nothing about typesetting Arabic: any tips? (I realise that
  this is the kind of thing people can dedicate their lives to, and is rather a large
  question)\r\n\r\nCheers"

    and that a party in New Zealand should use type from New Zealand. Try checking
    out local stuff.

    as for literaturnaya, even though one would have to know the history behind it
    (which most would not), it is important that we aren't associated with communism
    - as with almost the rest of the world, in NZ communism is used as a negative
    buzzword by media and politicians alike. By mentioning socialism, I was more trying
    to suggest that the font is highly accessible and readable which doesn't seem
    too fancy or classy, as this could be perceived as being pitched at upper classes
    or the more wealthy portions of society. A font of the people if you will.\r\n\r\n-Rafe"
