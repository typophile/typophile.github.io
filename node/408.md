  body: Looks like a somewhat bolder version of &#34;Tsichold&#39;s 1929  <BR>experimental
    alphabet, which was influenced by Bayer&#39;s  <BR>single-alphabet. His design
    was never put into production.  <BR><a href="http://www.on-idle.com/foundry/foundry_architype_1/tschi.html"
    target="_blank"> Architype Tsichold</a> is an exact rendering of his original  <BR>geometrically
    constructed design, and includes some of  <BR>his phonetic characters.&#34;

  body: <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/cennerik/">Cennerik</a> has
    some similarities, but the s is wrong, and this is actually a rounded typeface.
