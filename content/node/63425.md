  body: "I'm literally trying to build a toolbox. And, rather than grabbing a bunch
    of crap off the internet, I'd like to choose smart, well-designed typefaces. I'm
    interested in what makes them good and being able to have dialogue about why.\r\n\r\nProjects
    I'm working on now are more or less experiments with type. For example, changing
    the tone/feeling of a title by simply changing the type. That's where the feeling
    comes in \u2014 Garamond evokes a much different emotion than Univers even if
    the words themselves remain the same."

    typefaces (check out some of Rob Leuschke's stuff\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/200910.html).\r\n\r\nBut
    I think some of the emotions you're trying to match with fonts may be impossible
    (I don't think there are any fonts that say \"I'm hungry\"). In general, I don't
    think there are going to be a lot of fonts that really evoke the feelings you've
    listed. So much of this stuff depends on context. In he hands of a good designer,
    one font could evoke numerous feelings depending on how it's used and what surrounds
    it.\r\n\r\nWhat might be a useful exercise would be to do some fake projects and
    post them in the Critiques section to see if they evoke the feeling you're going
    after."

  body: "Thanks Jonathan. My first assignment was to study a non-branded place for
    at least an hour. For instance, my kitchen and describe the feelings associated
    with it, that's where I got hunger. I realize this is vague and maybe I should
    have explained the details of the assignment sooner. I guess I didn't want people
    to do my assignment for me, but rather give me tools to do it myself. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    I should have described this... My kitchen has a warm yet contemporary style (cherry
    hardwood floors and cabinets, stainless steel appliances and accented with bold
    rustic colors like deep red and brass). The cooking in there is usually dinner-time
    meals and we like to experiment with healthy recipes. My final composition for
    this assignment will simply be the title of this space, \"My Kitchen,\" (black
    on white) in a font that reflects the feeling of the space.\r\n\r\nOther spaces
    I've considered are the train (anxiety/stress, tired, bored, dirty), or my cubicle
    at work (boredom, excitement, tired - depends on the day) among others."

  body: "Boy, I thought I _was_ offering constructive advice.\r\n\r\nI guess what
    I was trying to get at in my last response is that there really isn't an answer
    to your question. A lot of feelings just can't be evoked simply by choosing a
    font. Now, you can find a lot of gimmicky fonts  that you might be able to use
    for very specific things (a perfect example would be the font Ouch, from Adobe
    http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/ouch/), but things like that have very specific
    uses and aren't the kind of things that that a good, functional collection is
    built on.\r\n\r\nYour latest post says you're \"looking to build a toolbox of
    well-designed typefaces.\" To me, that's much different than asking for fonts
    that evoke specific feelings. It's also a much easier question to answer (although
    you'll give widely varying opinions).\r\n\r\nThe fonts that come with the Adobe
    Creative Suite are an excellent place to start. If you're going to be a designer,
    I think it's safe to assume you'll be using the suite. You get a bunch of classic
    and well-designed serifs (Adobe Garamond, Minion, Caslon, Arno, Janson), a nice
    slab serif (Chaparall), a very nice, flexible (and popular) sans serif (Myriad
    Pro), as well as a bunch of display faces.\r\n\r\nYou could probably do 90% of
    your work with just those.\r\n\r\nYou should probably add some classic sans serifs
    to your collection (Helvetica Neue or Univers, and maybe Futura), and some slab
    serifs (something along the lines of Rockwell or Stymie). Then maybe some more
    modern stuff (Meta, Antenna, oand Scala, of the top of my head).\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    name: jonathanhughes
  body: "Things make a lot more sense now. So for the kitchen example, there are a
    lot of feelings that it could evoke, but I'd look for one overall feeling, since
    the assignment forces you to make your point simply. You mentioned wood floors,
    rustic colors, healthy food, and \"we\" (family? friends? either way, I assume
    it's people you like being around). That stuff all points me towards a pretty
    specific overall feeling.\r\n\r\nSince you're looking for tools, rather than specific
    answers, here's some things to look into (I'm not saying you should pick these,
    but look into them and see why they might or might NOT be appropriate choices).
    This is all off the top of my head. I'm sure others here can provide much better
    examples.\r\n\r\nGeometric Sans Serifs: look at Futura and Avant Garde. They're
    very geometric, modern, and mechanical. Stainless steel appliance are all those
    things, but is that what the kitchen as a whole says to you?\r\n\r\nHumanist Sans
    Serifs: check out how the strokes in Myriad vary, and how the capital O has a
    barely perceptible slant to it, as if it were maybe based on handwriting. Look
    into other humainst sans serifs and see how they can blend a modern look with
    a human feeling.\r\n\r\nSlab Serifs: something like Rockwell is pretty geometric.
    Chapparal has (like Myriad) a slight handwriting feel to it\r\n\r\nScripts: there
    are formal ones, and ones that looking more like handwriting. Snell and Shelly
    are lovely, but very formal (maybe even slightly stiff?). Something Buffet Script
    (http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/27) is much looser and friendlier.\r\n\r\nHopefully,
    that gives you some stuff to look into without giving any obvious answers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if you don't want your teacher to think you're lazy, no matter how much time you
    spend on this, don't pick Papyrus."

    for you to learn something and I get the sense that you want us to do the leg
    work for you and your \"toolbox\".\r\n\r\nCan you see this from the other perspective
    and how lazy this looks?\r\n\r\nRoll up your shelves and put in some work. If
    you think this will be beneficial to your professional growth then invest the
    time. Many of the members on Typophile have devoted years and decades studying,
    designing and using type. Don't expect anyone with the proper knowledge to simply
    hand it over to a student who hasn't appeared to lift a finger.\r\n\r\nYou're
    not the first and won't be the last who has gotten this response. I've learned
    through the years that your attitude and approach speak volumes. I'm guessing
    you would have received a completely didn't response if you had generated a list
    of typefaces and asked for feedback."

    the websites of those listed on the [[http://typophile.com/node/30824?|list of
    font foundries]]. \r\n\r\nAlso, [[http://typophile.com/node/12145?|Robert Bringhurst's

    though I'm not a typographer, it's extremely accessible and informative, and will

  body: Comments above are spot on. Typefaces rarely carry this much meaning, it mostly
    depends on the context. What does help is considering what kind of tone you do
    or do not want a specific project to have. With an organization doing social justice,
    for example, one of those spikey athletic slabs would seem out of place, but a
    soft humanist sans might fit the bill.

    newspaper text? book of poetry? box of chocolates? box of computer software? a

    that has warm bold colors, hardwood floor and stainless steel appliances, I chose
    Rockwell Regular. I chose Rockwell because the serifs give it a friendly, warm
    feel. But because they are slab serifs with sharp corners, it also echoes a clean
    space and is reflective of the stainless steel. \r\n\r\nI also had to choose a
    font that was opposite of that. I went with Helvetica Narrow, which to me felt
    clean and more contemporary. While I like to think my kitchen is clean, I do think
    my kitchen has a warmer, friendlier quality better represented by Rockwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    other space I chose is my commute on the El in Chicago. It's cramped, stressful,
    anxious, busy, etc. The typeface I chose for this is Univers 47 Light Condensed
    Oblique with a little tighter kerning. I chose this because the type itself felt
    cramped because its condensed and with tight kerning. The light weight makes it
    feel insignificant, perhaps one of many, like on the train. The oblique give the
    type movement, much like the commotion on the train.\r\n\r\nThe opposite for the
    train is Baskerville Old Face which feels warm and friendly and settled. Perhaps
    on a random Sunday morning in the fall during a week that didn't happen to have
    construction, the train might feel like this. But certainly never my rush hour
    M-F commute.\r\n\r\nI'm open to friendly criticism of my choices. Thanks all!"
