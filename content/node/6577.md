body: Anyone know anything about the Impact font?  History, origins, etc.?  I&#39;ve
  been looking to do some work related to it, but don&#39;t want to step on any toes
  in the process. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;ve got an online reference that Google can&#39;t
  seem to point me at, I&#39;d love a URL. <BR> <BR>Much thanks.

  body: The description embedded in the font file &#40;probably written by Robert
    Norton&#41;  <BR> <BR>&#62; 1965. Designed for the Stephenson Blake type foundry.
    A very heavy, narrow, sans serif face intended for use in newspapers, for headlines
    and in advertisements. Aptly named, this face has a very large &#34;x&#34; height
    with short ascenders and descenders. <BR> <BR>As one of the Microsoft &#39;Web
    Fonts&#39; it&#39;s become very widely installed. It&#39;s preinstalled on Windows
    and Mac PC&#39;s and commonly installed with the other Web fonts by Linux users.    <BR>
