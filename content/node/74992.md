  left in toolbox)?\r\nI know that: \r\n1 is rectangle \r\n2 is star \r\n3 is circle
  \r\n4 is line \r\n5 is draw \r\n6 is pen \r\n7 is cutter \r\n8 is round point \r\n9
  is hard point \r\n0 is tangent point \r\nO is outline layer \r\nt is template layer
  \r\ng is guides layer \r\nh is hints layer. \r\nBut the thing I want to use the
  most, does not have a shortcut?"

    '1' on most keyboards.

    is shift+\xB4(acute key). A shame that it's a two-key action, but still - a mystery
    is solved after 10 years!"
