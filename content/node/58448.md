body: "Hello-\r\n\r\nI am working on setting up an online ordering program for a printing
  company. \r\nClients will be able to typeset basic business cards (created by a
  designer) with the software provided by www.nowtg.com\r\n\r\nI am having an issue
  with providing the software company with the fonts to use.\r\nThe software uses
  a microsoft word type editor to input the text for the business card.\r\n\r\nI have
  provided several fonts for nowtg to upload to the server for the editor, however
  we are running into several problems.\r\n\r\nWith the font Univers, there are several
  versions that I need uploaded. \r\n\r\nUnivers Condensed Bold Oblique, Univers Condensed
  Bold & Univers Condensed Oblique etc.\r\nHowever, when I submit the fonts, the support
  staff is running into problems because of the \"typeface name.\"\r\nAll of the typeface
  names say \"Univers\" and this causing the upload problems.\r\n(see screen shots)\r\n\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v346/edouble/Picture1.png\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v346/edouble/Picture3.png\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v346/edouble/Picture5.png\r\n\r\nIs
  there any way to change the typeface name??\r\n\r\nI have tried TransTypePro, FontLab
  and FontRenamer but I have been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be highly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nthank you-\r\nEric"

  body: "At first sight it looks like the naming convention of the PostScript Type1
    versions has been directly used for the (converted) TrueType fonts. One would
    expect that the deducted Font Subfamily names/style attributes ([TT/PS1] Full
    font name/FullName minus Font Family name/FamilyName) to work well with PS Type1
    (if I recall well, from already Windows 3.1 on it is allowed for this format to
    go beyond the four styles Normal, Italic, Bold, BoldItalic) and probably also
    with TrueType fonts in the Adobe font engines, but not in other applications under
    Windows. But experts like Thomas Phinney or John Hudson should correct me if I
    am wrong.\r\n\r\nRenaming as such &ndash;if, of course, allowed by the copyright
    holder&ndash; should not be a problem and the current naming could perhaps be
    kept for the NameID's 1 and 2 of PlatformID 1 and for the NameID's 16 and 17 of
    PlatformID 3, I reckon.\r\n\r\n"
