  many of the fonts that you recommend.\r\n\r\nWhat are your suggestions for: sans
  serif, business use font, not heavy in weight, can be used to write documents several
  pages long, that's easy to read in both print and on screen?\r\n\r\nI love documents
  printed in Whitney - it looks great in print with easy to read characters.  Whitney
  suffers on screen (e.g. in a pdf document).  The letters: 'a' and 's' are a particular
  problem because some areas of those letters are so skinny that they almost disappear.\r\n\r\n2
  others that come close - but not close enough are:\r\n\r\n- FF-Din looks good in
  print, and OK on screen.\r\n- Calibri works great on screen, but I feel it will
  date quickly just like Arial because it is a default font for MS Word.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestions?????\r\n"
