  a movie title sequence that has handsome roman numerals? \r\n\r\nOr just general
  suggestions for typefaces that work well for movie title sequences?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Roman numerals are just letters, of course. Personally, I like the Roman numerals
    on antique clock faces, typically in a condensed face with pronounced serifs like
    Onyx.
