  one..\r\n\r\n\r\nIm doing this project in which i complete briefs set by design
  studios, this brief is to make an A1 helvetica poster for the 50th anniversary of
  the typeface, using only 1 colour, set by Michael Place of 'build', a 2 week deadline.
  Iv had tons of ideas, this one is my favourite so far, and i thought id put it up
  here to see what people thought of it.\r\n\r\nIn my research, Helvetica amongst
  designers i have found, is a default. It the first thing they might set something
  in, without thought. So I thought id try and make an issue about 'putting thought'
  into choosing Helvetica. Which would be somewhat ironic on a poster for its 50th
  anniversary. I have tried to make it look 'trendy' and 'throw-away'to give the message
  doubt whether i have spent time choosing the typeface. \r\n\r\nYou're the typographers,
  my view of Helvetica might well be completely different to yours, id be thankful
  of any feedback good or bad, whether you think i should take a different route etc\r\n\r\nThankyou!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helvetica_5784.jpg]"

  body: "I disagree that you should add \"or not-\" it is simply redundant. Your statement
    here makes perfect sense without it. Therefore it is superfluous.\r\n\r\nI'm curious
    about your research that shows designers set things in Helvetica without thought.
    My intuition would say most serious or good designers always put some thought
    into their choice of typeface, for even the smallest application.\r\n\r\nI do
    think it works. I think it's witty and the irony comes across pretty clearly.
    I'm not sure about the \"trendy\" and \"throw-away\" part to give doubt as to
    whether you spent time choosing the typeface. I could imagine the designer of
    this poster didn't spend too much time debating whether to use Helvetica, because
    it seems entirely appropriate for the job. The statement, then, would refer to
    Helvetica's rich cultural heritage and the love/hate relationship contemporary
    designers have with it, and NOT to any actual choice about using it.\r\n\r\nPS
    I happen to be a designer, not a typographer."

  body: AND, if one interprets your reversed-out type as having the text highlighted
    in your design program, that could imply you're immortalizing the actual thought
    process of choosing a particular typeface. Although I'm not sure if that would
    be interpreted by non-designers.

  body: "thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nThe research into lazy designers comes from
    the work placements iv been on and my peers, there was many a time on  placements
    where designers around me would say 'oh just shove it in helvetica for now'. However
    of course im sure most good and great designers think before they design. But
    theres certainly a lot of bad designers around...\r\n\r\nActually the 'fifty years
    of Helvetica' bothers me, im not sure how to treat it...\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nOther
    ideas iv had for this project are:\r\n\r\n-Somehow utilising the 51 weights of
    'neue' in reference to the 50 years, although im not sure if it is considered
    helvetica neues 50th anniversary as it was obviously done later.\r\n\r\n-Printing
    the words 'fifty years of Helvetica' in a white ink over white paper, in reference
    to Helvetica being 'invisible', in for example a city, its everywhere but nobody
    sees it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/other-ideas_4956.jpg]\r\n\r\nthese
    are quick mock ups of ideas.....The first one came out of research on a site that
    listed products and then listed what other products people also like, i typed
    Helevtica in and got some bazarre results like 'robert deNero', and i thought
    it was strange because you could never define what someone who likes Helvetica
    also likes because it has mass appeal. I like this idea however it doesnt do much
    to comment on the '50 years of Helvetica'\r\n\r\nThe second idea, on the right,
    is in reference to how Helvetica in a city environment is walked passed without
    people looking, they assume what the sign says, if aa toilet sign was spelt wrong
    i dont think people would really notice. Actually this idea is awful haha.\r\n\r\nIve
    got about 1 week left to settle on an idea and produce that poster. If anyone
    has any views on Helvetica that could lead to a good poster idea id be very thankful
    to hear them."

  body: "<em>Really</em> dislike the kerning on that film poster, especially the 1\u201310.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me that you are trying to create a homage piece to Build rather than
    Helvetica and the underline style used as a background highlight feature is ubiquitous
    in magazines at the moment. \r\nSaying that, I rather like your first image or
    rather the concept, you could think about not using Helvetica in the text, something
    like, \u2018I considered many typefaces for this poster\u2019. If you stick with
    your original concept I would look at making the amount of bar that appears behind
    the characters projects a similar visual amount on the righthand rag. You could
    also think about what you should consider before using Helvetica, for example
    the rn combination that can appear as m. \r\nIf you consider using the People
    who like\u2026 concept, you should have a careful look at the kerning of the /
    (and the spelling, even if it is as you researched, it should be spelt correctly).\r\n\r\nTim"

    'build' homage. I think this might be because im actually finding it difficult
    to use Helvetica, i think i have only used it once before.\r\nThe 'highlight'
    effect really just came out of trying to make the first poster look trendy to
    sort of undermine whether the designer had spent time on it. Whether this works
    is another thing.\r\n\r\nI think i am going to explore the first idea more.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    also like the basic treatment best on the 1st one-- 'I  thought long and hard..'
    \r\n\r\nI like the concept of calling out Helvetica being more than a 'default'
    font. \r\n\r\nI don't really get the spelling it wrong thing. I think maybe  you're
    trying to call out that Helvetica is beautiful, any way you look at it-- trying
    to strip the meaning away from the name and just set the letters. \r\n\r\nI like
    the names going off just one side. I like the reference it makes to the basic-ness
    of Helvetica. To me, that's the genius of that version. I think that's conceptually
    strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
