  need some links (good ones :-)) about it and if there is a place where (or if is
  possible-economicly speaking) I can produce a set of metal type to use in an old
  hand press?\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: <a href="http://www.briarpress.org/">BriarPress.org</a> is a great letterpress
    community with a lot of good info and classifieds where you can purchase metal
    type. Having metal type made from a digital font is probably not the best way
    to go (if that's what you were thinking).

    Wisconsin sells sets of metal type. You would want to call them to see what sets
    are up for sale. When I visited, I seem to recall they had more for sale than
    what appeared on their website.\r\n\r\nJust a thought. Happy hunting!\r\n\r\nMark\r\n\r\nwww.woodtype.org"

    at a letterpress shop. I just don't remember the company.
