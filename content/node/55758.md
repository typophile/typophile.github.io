  of all, both names start with \"r\" and have logos with accent lines near the letter
  \"e,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It goes beyond that,\" Scoville added. \"If you chop the
  top off of the 'h,' you (almost) have the 'm' in Re/Max. The next letter is an 'a,'
  and if you take the 'v' then you have half of an 'x.'\"</em>\r\n\r\nHilarious."

    with something that doesn\u2019t appear to have been barfed up in the 1970s by
    a guy who had never worked with phototype before."

    Pepsi branding PDF.\r\n\r\n<em>Almost.</em>\r\n\r\n@James: I'll have to use that
    description for some of the more choice logos I see."

  body: RE/MAX might have a case if the new outfit also had a slash in their name,
    but this suit is as valid as Apple suing Applied Materials for having a similar
    name. I'm totally serial.

  body: Its sad that companies (and individuals) feel they can exploit the judicial
    system in this way. rehava will most likely be the ones who benefit from the PR
    coverage of this unfounded/dismissible case. Oh yeah, and the RE/MAX logo is hideous
    (but recognizable).

  body: "I always read \"RF/MAX\" and wonder why they never fixed such a clear failure
    of design.\r\n\r\nI suspect they may have been gearing up for a modern rebrand,
    which, as we have seen with Xerox et al, generally means setting the name in lowercase...
    and the Rehava logotype looks too much like what they wanted to change it to.
    To deal with that this way is even more ill-advised, but who among us can say
    they've met a realtor (er, \"REALTOR\xAE\") with more sense than a fish?"
