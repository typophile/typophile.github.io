  body: Nice indeed. The shapes of the serifs remind me a bit of the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/renault/t-tu-light/testdrive.html?s=Coverage&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Renault</a> typeface, but your sample is way better.

  body: Ah.. we are getting warmer - the &#39;g&#39; as well as the &#39;C&#39; and
    the &#39;v&#39; are very similar. How you are locating these is beyond me.

  body: I can&#39;t remember the name of the designer and name of the font, sorry.
    But I&#39;m pretty sure its a custom font designed by a English Type designer
    who have worked at Wolf Olins after Jeremy Tankard. The type seems based on Melior.
