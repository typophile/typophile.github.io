body: "In my current font project (a cursive conscript*), I have added the OpenType
  features [aalt], [init], [medi], [fina] and [liga] (along with the usual [kern]).
  These features compile without any errors and appear to work properly in the OpenType
  Features tab of the Preview panel (they don't preview properly on the Preview tab,
  but I've read on the FontLab forums that [init], [medi] and [fina] don't preview
  at all in FontLab Studio, but still work in applications), but when I generate the
  font (as a .ttf), none of them work in the applications I use this font in (Photoshop
  and Word '07-'10). It's as if they're not there. However, they appear in the relevant
  tabs when I open the .ttf in Studio, exactly as they are in my project file.\r\n\r\nI
  read in another topic at FontLab that Studio 5.0.4 doesn't work on 64-bit Windows
  Vista (which I use), but I want to be sure I haven't done something wrong in writing
  the features before I ask about replacing Studio 5.0.4 with v5.0.2.\r\n\r\nA few
  notes on the font itself, as well as the features as I've written them: I've put
  the contextual forms of each character in the Plane 1 PUA while using the basic
  Latin/ASCII codepoints for the nominal forms to make entering text easier. The features
  are in the reverse order from what is recommended for Arabic fonts (i.e. [init]
  is first instead of [fina]), and there is no [isol] feature.\r\n\r\nI should mention
  that I'm a font creation newbie, not a professional. There's plenty I don't know
  about making fonts, especially ones with OpenType features. There's a pretty good
  chance my feature definitions contain an error that slipped past FontLab Studio,
  especially since VOLT can't compile these features (the error message it gives me
  is very vague - \"Compilation failed\"). Your help will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n*I.e.
  a constructed writing system, if you aren't familiar with the term"

    OT features in TTFs when there's a digital signature table present in the font.\r\n\r\nSo
    I'd start by testing in an application that actually supports the features, e.g.
    InDesign :)"

  body: Thanks for the help, Jens. Unfortunately, I don't have InDesign or the money
    for it, and my attempts to find out what other applications support my features
    have so far turned up nothing. I've just tried testing my font in Word as an OTF,
    but my features still don't work. Do you know if Word 2010 supports OT features
    in OTFs without needing a signature?

  body: "Since I can't find any way to edit the above reply, a new post will have
    to suffice...\r\n\r\nAfter doing some more research and editing/reordering my
    font's features, I was able to unlock the OpenType options in Word's Font window
    with text in my font selected. However, my features (now with fina first) still
    don't work. I have a feeling that it might be due to my inclusion of aalt, which
    I now know Word 2010 doesn't support. The next step, then, should probably be
    to remove it and test the font again. Thoughts, anyone?"

  body: Latest progress report... After looking at arabtype.ttf and Times New Roman,
    I no longer think that my inclusion of aalt is the cause of my feature troubles,
    since both fonts have that feature and work fine with it. That leaves me with
    no further ideas on what ideas to try out, since my features still don't work
    (not even [kern]). I've tried enabling OpenType features in Word, but they still
    don't work, not even now that the font is an OTF. So, if you have any suggestions,
    I'd love to hear them...

  body: "<em>there is no [isol] feature.</em>\r\n\r\nPerhaps try to include an isol
    feature. Word may be checking the presence of all four positional features before
    activating them. But that's just a guess. Another possibility is that Word supports
    init, medi, fina only for some complex scripts like Arabic, but not for Latin."

  body: "Time to dust this thread off...\r\n\r\nI just received InDesign CS5.5 and
    can now test my font's OT features properly. Here's what I found:\r\n\r\nInDesign
    knows that my features exist, and it substitutes the contextual forms in most
    of the appropriate situations (after selecting Automatic Forms via the Character
    panel). However, it tries to apply init, medi and fina to every character it recognizes
    as a letter instead of using the classes I specified in the features. In other
    words, it tries to apply e.g. init and medi to non-joining characters (which lack
    initial and medial forms, so it defaults to the isolated form). It also doesn't
    seem to be applying isol at all, so glyphs following a non-joining character are
    replaced with medial and final forms instead of initial and isolated forms. These
    problems lead me to believe that InDesign is ignoring my OT classes, possibly
    even the entire feature set.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that I added an aalt
    feature and have isol ordered before fina/medi/init, so it's possible that InDesign
    is either overriding the results of isol (which shouldn't happen, based on how
    I wrote isol) or ignoring isol entirely."

    codepages (mostly A-z) and put the contextual forms in the PUA. Anything else
