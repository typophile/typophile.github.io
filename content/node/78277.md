  body: 'That treatment says retro hippie organic more than whimsical art posters.  The
    tilt of the /e/ and the kerning are what stands out (in a bad way) typographically
    to me. '

  body: Top line appears to be sloping downwards from left to the right. Other than

  body: The errant e puts me in mind of nothing so much as a sign fallen into disrepair.

  body: Thanks for the feedbag! I really do like the font and even the idea of it
