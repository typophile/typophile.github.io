    what was wrong with the original one. The fact that it's anti-chirographic or
    not how some established designers always make their \"g\"s is really entirely
    moot - readers don't react to that stuff, at least not in a text face. And I realize
    now that the lc \"k\" needs more character as well.\r\n\r\nBoring might seem \"safe\",
    but in this overcrowded scene it more often translates to reduced salability.
    Unless you have a stellar pre-existing reputation, the font includes thousands
    of glyphs, or something else that makes it stand out. Slimbach can get away with
    being boring, in fact he's probably come to depend on it, but you and I Eduardo

  body: "Hi Eduardo,\r\n\r\nTwo comments after a brief look:\r\n1. The lowercase looks
    much better than the uppercase. The main problem with the uppercase is inconsistent
    weighting of the thin strokes. Compare the middle crossbar of the E with the top.
    Yes it should be thinner, but only slightly so. And the serif is too lightly bracketed.
    Compare the top of the E with the thin part of the O, of the U, of the G, of the
    Q etc. Those are too heavy in my opinion. They match the M and N thin strokes
    which are also too heavy I think. The caps need consistent modulation. I think
    matching all the thins to the top of the E will give a good feel. Also, I think
    the uppercase is slightly too dark compared to the lowercase. For languages with
    frequent caps (like german) this is a distraction. One other thing: The points
    on the W and V are not very pointy! They seem too chunky and out of place.\r\n\r\n2.
    The lowercase j\r\nThe terminal is too weak. It should be as strong as the f.
    Also, the j needs more support at the baseline. The problem is accentuated by
    the tapering stem. It almost shrivels away to nothing. Perhaps less taper and
    start the curve a little higher (closer to the baseline)?\r\n\r\nJFP: What makes
    a good guillemot? How should his be revised? More point? More stroke modulation?
    Slightly higher so they work with caps too?\r\n\r\nRandy"

    structure can easily look like bad finish, because it stands out and creates unevenness.
    So it's easy to notice and say, 'clean that up'.\r\nSo if you have a few examples
    of weirdness, they are excised, and the thing gets an even finish, but ends up
    bland.\r\n\r\nThe other route to go is to multiply the weirdness so that it takes
    over the font, but in an even, well-finished-weird kind of way.\r\n\r\nWeirdness,
    pardon me, I mean personality, can also camouflage bad finish, by rendering \"good\"

  body: "> creates unevenness\r\n\r\nIt depends how you look at it. If somebody considers
    a certain conventional mean as being some sort of formal requirement then I guess
    any divergence from that could be called \"uneven\". But since I don't believe
    such a mean exists (at least not at the formal visual level) I prefer to see \"uneven\"
    as: something confined to overly distracting color; and something that can actually
    be useful - with there being such a thing as <cite>too much</cite> evenness.\r\n\r\nIn
    this design for example the original \"g\" -which JF complained about- I would
    never consider \"uneven\", even though I can't really be sure it's structurally
    ideal (although I suspect it's fine, and I like to give the benefit of the doubt
    to divergence/innovation - as long as it's well-motivated).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    The \"j\" needs slightly more stroke contrast in the tail I think; and I would
    make its head serif longer.\r\n\r\nUC: Isn't the \"C\" too wide, and its bottom
    curve too flat at the end? The \"G\" I would make a hair narrower too.\r\n\r\nThe
    bar in the ordinals seems too close - in small sizes it will clot. I like your
    \"ch\" ligature - very nice. The other two though are a bit unhappy at the head
    of the \"t\" though. The bottom-left of the eth seems unhappy. And I would make
    the bar of the Eth go in less deep.\r\n\r\nSpacing: unless it's for smaller sizes
    (in which case the color is a bit light, and the vertical proportions a bit too
    deep*) the spacing is a bit loose - although at \"boundary conditions\" (like
