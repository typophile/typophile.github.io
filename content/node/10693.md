body: This typeface originated from the handwritten form of the letter &#34;B&#34;.  It
  consisted of a series of upper and lower case B&#39;s written out on a large piece
  of paper. I searched for letter forms within the original letter. When the letters
  were cut out there was an area of negative space left surrounding the form. This
  is just a preliminary sketch and I would like some feedback before I continue. Thanks.<img

  body: 'sean, i&#39;m working with jori on this project, and she&#39;s planning on
    doing the positive/negative switch once she gets things digitized fully.  <BR>i
    think the concept is good, and the fact that you&#39;re finding all the forms
    from those b variants is pretty amazing. they all have a consistent feel, which
    is obviously good. it&#39;s interesting how the negative shapes aren&#39;t totally
    enclosed by the black, due to the cutting of them.  that becomes a bit distracting
    on the &#34;o&#34; and i want to say it looks like a &#34;p&#34;, but like sean
    said, it would be good to see some words. he&#39;s right about the &#34;v&#34;,
    but again, it would help to see it used in context. utilizing tight letterspacing,
    with the black areas touching will probably affect things quite a bit, so the
    samples will be important. '

  body: I would like to publicly apologize for the horrid first attempt at a critique
    on this typeface.  I am deeply ashamed, and wish you the best of luck with this
    typeface. I think it is very unique, and I know you will find ways to make it
    even better than it already is.  I am fortunate enough to know you pretty well,
    and I think you have quite the knack for pulling things together in the end.  I
    don&#39;t think this will be an exception.  Good work. <BR> <BR>C

  body: i&#39;m diggin the look and would like to see the family lined out or just
    some word forms. the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;h&#34; look a bit forced like your trying
    to outline the letters. the &#34;x&#34; and the &#34;v&#34; are my favorite, they
    seem very naturalistic. i would rethink the &#34;L&#34;.  <BR> <BR>-ak
