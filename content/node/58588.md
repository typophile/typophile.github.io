body: "Greetings fellow Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am currently compiling a comprehensive
  survey of the career of Chicago lettering artist and type designer Oswald Cooper,
  designer of Cooper Black, for publication in an upcoming issue of IDEA Magazine.
  I am currently on the hunt to photograph rare pieces of Cooper's work that is neither
  in the Newberry Library's collection of Cooper's work nor in the lone monograph
  of his work, The Book of Oz. \r\n\r\nIf you reside in North America and have a rare
  piece of Cooper's work that you are willing to share, I will be traveling through
  the U.S. and Canada at the end of the summer to photograph and document what work
  of Cooper's that folks are interested in sharing.\r\n\r\nThanks for bending an ear.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nIan
