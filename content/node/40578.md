  (<em>adj</em>): Quite pleased. \r\n\r\nIn [[Typophile]] [[Terminology]]; it's rather
  the opposite of [[Squoosh]] as coined by [[Miss Tiffany]].\r\n\r\nAs the orginal
  post also illustrates, less useful terminology has also been developed, based loosely
  around the lesser Chuff (<em>intransitive verb</em>): to produce noisy exhaust or
  exhalations : proceed or operate with chuffs <the chuffing and snorting of switch
  engines \u2014 Paul Gallico> \r\n"
