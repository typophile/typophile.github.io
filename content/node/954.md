  body: Jim Richardson <BR> <BR>There is a man in New York &#40;5th Ave in Manhattan,
    I have heard&#41; who has great knowledge of early American Types. Sorry I don&#39;t
    have any phone or Email for you, but you should be able to find him. His name
    is Steven O. Saxe <BR> <BR>Also try David M. Norton 976 Westmoreland Ave., Syracuse,
    NY 13210. This man writes a brief bio of early Wild West types in &#34;The Printer&#34;
    virtually every month. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, Subscribing to this 12 page tabloid
    might be a good thing. It comes out every month, and is loaded with good information,
    historical and practical. <BR> <BR>Contact Michael &amp; Sally Phillips, 337 Wilson
    Street, Fibdlat, OH 45840 USA  Ph 419-422-4958 Fax 423-2472. No Email.  &#40;they
