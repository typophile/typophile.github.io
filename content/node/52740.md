body: "Dissertation writing is an academic pursuit that requires painstaking work,
  tedious analysis, and heaps and heaps of patience.  While it is admittedly a complicated
  process in itself, there are still ways to make the load a bit more bearable for
  every writer. \r\n\r\nHere then are five guidelines that will lighten the usual
  burdensome weight of dissertations:\r\n\r\nSet <a href=\"http://particletree.com/notebook/the-importance-of-deadlines/\">Deadlines</a>\r\nPut
  some constructive pressure on yourself by setting up deadlines for every section
  and chapter of the dissertation. Although a large majority detests having to put
  up with these time limits, the truth is that people normally go through a more difficult
  time without these deadlines to push and encourage them. It is these bothersome
  deadlines that spur you to write on a regular basis, thus keeping you progressing
  and moving forward in your dissertation.\r\n\r\nBefriend the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library\">Library</a>\r\nIn
  your dissertation writing, you must accept that the library will be your second
  home for the next several months. Endeavor to maximize all the rich resources it
  can provide for your paper. Books, journals, magazines, old newspaper clippings:
  these library materials contain concepts and ideas that can definitely strengthen
  the argument and essence of the dissertation. Be sure to pour over every relevant
  source available.\r\n\r\nIncorporate a Note-taking Technique\r\nAs you\u2019ll be
  immersed and bombarded with innumerable information as you move along in your dissertation
  writing, you should integrate a <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/success/notes.html\">note-taking
  system</a> to help clear your head. It does not have to be one specific method.
  You can use a set of index cards, or a software program, or even a simple notepad.
  Whatever scheme works for you, stick to it throughout your dissertation. As your
  research increases by leaps and bounds, your notes will aid to organize your thoughts,
  thus bringing all the dissertation concepts neatly together.\r\n\r\nLook Back\r\nMonths
  to years of sifting through statistics and information can evolve your dissertation
  into something far from your primary objective. If you do not wish for this to happen,
  it\u2019s then recommended that you constantly refer back to the initial articles
  that prompted your study. Such a practice will redirect you to your target path
  as well as remind you of supposed important elements that you have neglected and
  forgotten due to the streaming tide of data coming in.\r\n\r\nLet Go\r\nSee the
  bigger picture by taking a step back from your dissertation. Sometimes, to gain
  more perspective for your piece, you must learn to breathe and leave your paper
  for periods of time. A fresh and recharged mind is more capable of handling the
  rigors of <a href=\"http://www.bestdissertation.com/\">dissertation writing</a>
  and analysis than a stressed and drained one. Also, when the time comes to end your
  paper and you still have not included everything you planned to say, just let go
  and accept it. Be gracious of the fact that not everything can be incorporated in
  your dissertation. The more you let go, the more you will be able to end with a
  good and powerful conclusion.\r\n\r\nBy integrating these five guidelines, you\u2019ll
  be more organized to author your dissertation, as well as be more open-minded for
  possible dissertation predicaments and surprises. \r\n"
