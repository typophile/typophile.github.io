  body: Thank you twice Mike, but this is not the one. <BR> <BR>There were really
    two weights, sexy-light sexy-regular &#40;this is a not the name of course but
    a fair description&#41;, and, as I remember; it was more proportional, &#34;better
    done&#34;. I remember something with the &#34;I&#34; or the &#34;L&#34; that is
    not in this Font. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; If I am offending somebody please let me
    know and this is over.

  body: Aha. Well I&#39;ve come across more explicit fonts in my font searches, but
    they&#39;re not my thing and I paid little attention. Sorry.

  body: Thanks Mike, but I think you misunderstood me when I put the example about
    the &#34;I&#34; and the &#34;L&#34;, &#40;bad example I see know&#41; the type
    that I am talking about &#40;I am sure I saw it&#41; is not explicit at all, in
    fact, I remember it was done with a very good taste, it looks a lot to the one
    you told me, but if you see, in this font the siluettes are not proportional at
    all, the letter is always the same heigth but the siluetes don

  body: Hey Ignacio, I did indeed misunderstand. <BR>Try <a href="http://darrianlynx.o-f.com/graphics/fonts/letterfont.html"
    target=_top>Alpha Silhouette 2 &amp; 3</a>. These aren&#39;t different weights,
    but, rather, filled and solid, so they probably aren&#39;t the right ones. They
    seem to fit your description otherwise, though, including the difference in the
    characters between the two and the lack of proportionality. <BR> <BR>Tom. Yep,
    there are some, uh, unique fonts at that site. I can&#39;t see ever actually using
    any, except perhaps the film reel. <BR><br>
