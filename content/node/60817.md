body: I would like to submit the font shown below to Adobe [sorry for white overlaps
  in some glyphs]. Could I have contact details and any relevant info, if essential.
  Thanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A-Z-AND-a-z-1-10-portland-background_4253.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/A-Z-AND-a-z-1-10-italic-portland-background_4902.gif]

    place for a freelancer to get started. I recall that Linotype.com used to (and
    may still) have a page for freelance submissions.\r\n\r\nAnd Monotype has a link
    here http://www.fonts.com/Contact/_submit.htm\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Robbie Smith of Smith Hand's\r\n\r\nTo nick,\r\nIt is very different from
    Perpetua up close, having been designed from carved letters and not from the serif
    type tradition.\r\nYes, I plan to design a bolder version, that is bolder to a
    nice degree but not very black.\r\n\r\nAdobe are great supporters of hand craft
    inspired fonts, but Monotype is an option. Thanks for the link.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Robbie, feel free to contact me directly and I'll give you the details.\r\n\r\nI
    don't want to discourage anyone from submitting their font proposals to Adobe
    for consideration, but I don't think it's any secret that the rate at which we
    develop designs from outside designers is nothing like what it was in the '90s.
    There is certainly no harm in trying -- please just set your expectations accordingly.
    :)"
