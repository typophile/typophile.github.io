    me of a very precise architect's printing. No luck matching the numbers yet...."

  body: Kevin, I think Register Sans is too Narrow but the numbers on the clock I
    agree are  most likely custom. I am still sticking with Gotham Rounded at this
    point.

    numbers are pretty close and would take only a little editing to become a passable
    substitute. The letters are fairly close as is.\r\nDon"

  body: Sorry Jean-Louis but I'm pretty convinced this one should be custom. Officine
    Panerai was an official supplier to the Regia Marina, the Royal Italian Navy,
    supplying watches and precision instruments. In the first decades of the 20th
    century Officine Panerai began experimenting intensively with luminous materials
    in an effort to make instrument dials, sights, and telescopic devices that could
    be employed reliably in the dark. The main specificity of their first model Radiomir
    is a 2 layer dial. Bottom disk is plainly coated with a zinc sulphide and radium
    bromide luminescent combination. Top one is a completely black stencil, cut out
    with the digits thus needing a specific stencil design.

  body: "Thank you all! Custom, that's nothing to be sorry about Ryuk. It's proof
    that the better things don't come off-the-shelf.\r\n\r\nI absolutely love their
    design and brand ID. It's understated (except the size), but there's a warmth
    in the colours, in the shape of the letters, etc. \r\n\r\nThough it's all a bit
    more marketing than actual watchmaking genius, it works. Bill Clinton used to
    wear one back in the days, and maybe still does, and it seems the choice for young
    investment bankers. Since the case diameters are so large, the watches are highly
    visible, which makes them first choice for the nouveaux riches who like to show
    off. Today, even my barber uses one!\r\n\r\nDefinitely not for me, except that
    beautiful table clock. But then, who needs tables clocks?"

  body: "Ryuk, I believe you, they look great! A bit oversized in my opinion, but
    you can always wear them on top of a shirt, like Gianni Agnelli used to do. My
    choice is a PP Nautilus, you can wear it with a wet suit or a tux, and more ergonomic
    on the wrist. What more does a man need? :)\r\n\r\nThanks for all suggestions,
    including the aircraft clock post! \r\n\r\nIt also reminded me of Engravers and
    the likes. I've been trying to use them, but with certain letter combinations
    they look very rigid and \"dated\". As is the case with my sketch on the right.
    Some of your suggestions might work better.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mera_5656.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks Ryuk for the explanation of Officine Panerai dial technology. My only
    remaining question is about what year did they introduce the design for these
    particular numbers.\r\n\r\nMany interesting font suggestions, but I now believe
    that none of them, including the Gotham Rounded numbers -- which are too narrow
    and have mid height waist lines -- capture the flavor of the numbers in the  Officine
    Panerai dial. Rather than picking and choosing number sets that are poor approximations,
    its probably easier just to make the numbers from scratch. For example:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DHTPaneraiNumbersBetaSM_5998.jpg]\r\nThe
    numbers not shown on the dial, i.e. _0_, _4_, _5_, and _7_, are guesses based
    on the known numbers.\r\nDon"
