		<div class="commentbody">Seriously: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, there was a discussion about this on the ATypI list itself, a little over a year ago. It starts here: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.textmatters.com/pipermail/members/2001-February/014320.html">http://www.textmatters.com/pipermail/members/2001-February/014320.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The conference and membership are not strongly related; the conference discount you get does not make up for the membership. So attending a conference is a great idea for anybody, as long as you can justify the cost wrt what you get out of it. But even for somebody with not enough reason to be a regular at ATypI conferences, it's probably a good idea for any font freak to do it at least once, especially if there's a geographic facility. And Tiffany's right about Rome: it does look like it's going to the best one in a while. But I've only been to two before, so&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, when it comes to being a paying member, that's frankly much harder to justify. I suspect that many people do it as a socio-professional obligation. Some people do it because it does feel like a fraternity, to some extent. And some people do it because they're freaks (like my case). On the other hand, membership does have its priviledges: you get first access to certain publications; you get to ask questions of the notably illustrious members (as opposed to just listening to them); and once in a while you get favorable treatment versus non-members (which is natural for any organization). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So give it all some serious consideration, and you might find that it's for you after all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; there are quite a few illustrious long-time attendees who aren't members <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True*, but like Kent said, I was talking about the mailing list, and by extension actual membership in the organization (as opposed to going to a conference, a much less nebulous decision to make). Unless you have a very large loudspeaker (not to mention more gall than would be advisable, even by me) you can't ask questions to a collection of experts during the conference. Not that most of them generally reply on the ATypI  list anyway :-/ especially if you're unwilling to spend a few years groveling before asking anything of any significance&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* In fact, I would point to this as an indication of the large difference between being a member versus going to the conference. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; that's where I got my jump-start <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My own intial large-scale exposure to other type designers (at least in the physical realm - which still has advantages over cyberspace) was at the supremely wonderful TypeCon98. That was one trippy event, with an atmosphere completely different (and certainly much more &quot;open&quot;) than ATypI99 in Boston, my second outing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

At my first ATypI, I met Mike Parker at dinner, Erik Spiekermann at a cocktail party, Erik and Just at my hotel, and John Dreyfus en route to Adrian Frutiger's house. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I certainly wouldn't recommend using the question and answer session after someone's lecture to discuss personal business, nor is it a good idea to buttonhole anyone without warning, but this has less to do with ATypI than with good manners.
