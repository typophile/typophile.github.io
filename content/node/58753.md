  italicized serif typeface thats really fat?  I've been seeing it a lot lately.  It's
  really classic, used a lot.  Especially in the 70s on textbooks and stuff.\r\n\r\nIf
  I can find an example I'll post it, but until then, post suggestions.\r\n\r\nIt
  actually is similar to times bold italic, but heavier\r\n\r\nhelp"
