body: "\"if i'd get a penny everytime i search on myfonts\u2026\"\r\n\r\ni just discovered
  that there's a <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=www.myfonts.com&sherlock=yes&opensearch=&submitform=Search\"
  target=\"_blank\">plugin for firefox</a> that adds myfonts.com to the search-bar
  (upper right corner). \r\n\r\nwith ctrl+k, you can access the search-bar, with ctrl+arrow
  up/down you can chose the one you want. use the plugin \"search engine ordering\"
  to be able to change the order of the site-searches and delete the ones you dont
  want (right-click on an entry, \"delete\")"

  body: 'You can do that with Opera too. Any search box from any site can be added
    to the drop-down search menu. So you only need to enter the name of a font once
    to search Google, Myfonts, Identifont, Typophile and any others in a row. Just
    right-click the box you want + "create new search" (or something like that, I
    have it in French). '
