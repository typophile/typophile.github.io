  I have an unfair bias since two of the works published in the book are mine so I
  will try to be fair. \r\nThe images collected are a joy to look at but I wish there
  would have been more connection to the text in the book. Some visuals have plenty
  of description while others (the ones that appealed to me most) get none. There
  is no apparent reason why these choices were made. Adding brief captions would have
  helped the reader understand why the author included that particular image. \r\nFor
  a book on typography, I found the layout and typography less than stellar. I would
  have expected great typography and design. The H&J settings are spotty and the column
  spacing is claustrophobic. The unneeded meandering between 3 column and two column
  layout is just bewildering. With such a high density of visuals to text, the layout
  has not found a way to make it all work together. I find myself wishing for more
  text and I am a visual guy! \r\nAll-in-all, I like the book for what it contains
  and give kudos to the author for her amazing effort in collecting so many differing
  pieces. I just wish that the presentation matched the ingredients.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_image_5342.png]"
