  body: "No, Big Noodle is not Camper, but as far as I'm aware Camper is not available
    to purchase. \r\nI was hoping to find something a little closer, especially the
    form of the A and M, but I appreciate you taking time to offer the suggestion.\r\nthanks"

  body: "I meant the paid versus free versions of Big Noodle Titling.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/big-noodle-titling/\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\n-
    Does MyFonts allow you to give away a font you sell through them (or sell it cheaper)?\r\n-
    How easy is it to pull a font off of Dafont? Let's say you decide to start selling
    it instead of giving it away.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hrant,  I was not aware of the paid version of Big Noodle and have no idea
    how it compares to the freeware version. Some people from years ago who started
    with freeware fonts have updated them for sale by expanding character sets etc.
    I do not know if this is the case for Big Noodle Titling.

  body: Went & looked -- Big Noodle from dafont is free for personal use only. It
    would seem any commercial use would require purchase.
