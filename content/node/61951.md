  interested in your Opinion. Right now it was like one complete Week ok Work an i
  think i want to finish it in one month.\r\nLower and Uppercase follow different
  Rules. The lowercase is much more \xBBscriptlike\xAB than the uppercase.\r\nI really
  like this difference but wanted titling-featues for some of the uppercase characters.
  I think there will be an titl and a final version for every lowercase letter plus
  a bunch of ligatures.\r\n\r\nFeel free to coment. Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/promo_blog_02_a_4034.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/promo_blog_02_b_6233.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/promo_blog_02_c_6029.png]"
