  alphabet. I'm currently using Fontographer 5 to build up my letter. (I could do
  it with Illustrator in like 5 minutes, but I want to learn the new softwares ;))\r\nSo
  my question is: While I'm building up my letter at some places I left 2 points at
  the same spot, and when I tried to merge them I didn't get one point instead of
  2, but none and a curve.\r\n\r\nSomething went wrong with the image uploads, so
  I'll just add the links.\r\n\r\nwhat I want: http://cl.ly/1b0N0Z323z260O0E1V3K/Screen_shot_2011-03-29_at_11.04.31_AM.png\r\nWhat

  Also, tips are accepted if you recognize anything with the letter! ;)"

    right.

  body: In Fontographer, "Merge Points" basically means "delete point(s) without breaking
    the contour". So if you select two points and Merge, both of them will be deleted
    (and adjacent points may be automatically modified to try and maintain the overall
    shape of of the contour). So you probably want to select just one of the two points
    -- whichever is more out of alignment -- then Merge Points. And as Nick pointed
    out, the contour is broken at the top right.
