  body: I would guess that you are having a font cache problem and that InDesign is
    holding on to an earlier version that didn't have the apostrophe.

  body: "Thanks Mark,\r\n\r\nI've tried that font cache cleaner program that is recommended,
    didn't seem to help. Besides, other changes I'm making are showing up, that's
    the only reason I don't thing it's the cache. Or is it selectively 'cache'ing?"

  body: Do you have smart quotes turned one? Does your font not include a "dumb" apostrophe
    in it as well?
