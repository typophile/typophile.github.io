    we really can't offer anything unless you give us some background.

    more attractive.\r\n\r\nI would try moving the hat away from the arm a little
    to give him some more head space.\r\n\r\nHis arm looks a bit too thick.\r\n\r\nHave
    you tried some curves on the legs?\r\n"

    side has a greater radius than the left. Is this for the porn star or is it another
    joke?\r\n\r\nTim"

    I made up. I might play with it some more. I like the ideas of the shoes.\r\n\r\ntimd:
    His right hand? I only see one hand :D\r\n\r\nwormwood: ill try moving the hat
    further away but I dont want to off balance it to the left to much."

    it left at all.\r\n\r\nThis logo is very different in style to your illustration
    work on your website.\r\nI especially like 'Lamphead'.\r\n"
