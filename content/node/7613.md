body: I was hired to create a Corp.ID &#40;logo design, business card, envelope, A4
  blank&#41; for a company, which specializes in car sales &#34;automobile sales&#34;.  <BR>
  <BR>The client wants a fresh and stylish look &#40;but not abstract / more or less
  illustrative&#41;. The name of the company &#34;Shik&#34; in translation means chic/elegant.
  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53223.jpg" alt="auto">
  <BR>I would love to hear your critique and advices. <BR> <BR>P.S Any advices on
  the font choice are welcome. The direction is to match the word &#34;chic&#34; with
  a corresponding font.

    How do Bulgarians feel about Arabs, or Turks? I ask because of the certain Middle
    Eastern flavor of that font. Especially since it sounds like &#34;sheikh&#34;!
    :-/  If it were Russia I&#39;d say stay away from that style for sure &#40;I still
    remember the way the people on the plane from Moscow to Novosibirsk were looking

    <BR>&#62;&#62; How do Bulgarians feel about Arabs, or Turks?  <BR>&#60;&#60; Not
    so great, because of the turkish slavery on Bulgaria. It lasted for 5 centuries.
    Nevertheless, nowadays people are more broad-minded than they were for example
    1-2 centuries before. It seems that the contemporary spirit of the bulgarians
    is trying to mingle with every single culture it come across. This creates an
    amalgam&#40;mixture&#41; of cultures, which in my humble opinion is not a good
    thing. Everybody is trying to copy the East or the West and not care about &#34;us&#34;
    and &#34;here&#34;.  <BR>If I have to answer the question directly - No, there
    is no prejudice about the arabs and sometimes they are even thought as a good
    thing. &#40;if we don&#39;t stem from historical point of view of course ;&#41;
    <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; Especially since it sounds like &#34;sheikh&#34;! :-/ <BR>&#60;&#60;
    You are right about that. However, in Bulgarian the word &#34;sheikh&#34; is pronounced
    somewhat differently than the word &#34;shik&#34;. In fact, the word &#34;shik&#34;
    in phonetical point of view is composited of only 3 phonemes &#40;&#34;sh&#34;
    - diphthong, &#34;i&#34; and &#34;k&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; If it were

    <BR> <BR>To Tanya :  <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; hmmm...spooky car. <BR>&#60;&#60; Is
    it the color&#40;black&#41; that creates the spooky sensation? I didn&#39;t want
    to entangle in complex illustration. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; It&#39;s looking quite
    eastern to me. some kind of asian or indian thing going on definately. <BR>&#60;&#60;
    I feel the same thing. It was not intentional, but after I am here maybe we can
    comment on the eastern look.  <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; ...has me thinking japan <BR>&#60;&#60;
    I have to admit that the circular elements on the business card are quite japanese
    ;&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;...has me thinking Arab <BR>&#60;&#60; It seems are
    though I have created a Corp.ID for an Arabic company. ;&#41;  <BR> <BR>To Scott

    word &#34;chic&#34; in my language have a multiple meaning and is often perceived
    as the word &#34;cute&#34; with a slight tint of extravagant. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;
    I&#39;m not sure about repeating it on both sides of the bizcard. <BR>&#60;&#60;
    I&#39;m not sure, either. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; Is there a reason you didn&#39;t
    layout out the letterhead in that same fashion?  <BR>&#60;&#60; It was a requirement
    for the envelope design - &#40;to center the logotype&#41; <BR> <BR>p.s Some propositions

    problems. That problem being the design of cars, their shapes, changes too often.
    I would say to not include that car because it will date itself too quickly.

  body: I agree that a wordmark instead of a wordmark/symbol would be a &#34;safer&#34;
    and more successful approach. <BR> <BR>In regards to what you have posted, I would
    suggest bleeding the red bar off the bottom of the page on the letterhead for
    more consistency throughout the pieces.  <BR> <BR>Also, the circles on the business
    card do not work, in my opinion. They add clutter, distract, and definitely do
    not give an overall feeling of being &#39;chic.&#39;

    The car, although already small, seems to draw as much attention as the name.

  body: just because the client says he likes the type doesn&#39;t mean  <BR>it&#39;s
    finalized.  I think the type needs a lot of work still, and you  <BR>shouldn&#39;t
    be so satisfied just yet. <BR> <BR>the bottom of the letterhead isn&#39;t handled
    very nicely.  <BR>it&#39;s blocky and weighed down.  it&#39;s also forced into
    a tiny  <BR>space.  i would move it up a centimeter or 2.  also,  <BR>the horizontal
    bars going right across the page are so generic.  <BR>there&#39;s no unique quality
    to them.  i&#39;ve seen that done  <BR>a thousand times.  you could maybe just
    put the bars bleeding  <BR>off the bottom edge, like the business card does.  also,
    the  <BR>repetition of the car twice is not very clean.  <BR> <BR>and why not
    just center the logo at the top? it looks good  <BR>that way on the business card.
    <BR> <BR>... <BR> <BR>each element is too different from each other. <BR>the hairline
    on the business card stops before reaching <BR>the edge. that could happen on
    the letterhead too. <BR>look at all the pieces together &#40;above&#41;  and notice
    how the spacing <BR>of each object or text block from a paper edge is different  <BR>every
    instance it&#39;s used.  the logo, for example, looks best with  <BR>a certain
    amount of negative space around it.  i don&#39;t think <BR>you should ever cram
    the logo somewhere or put other objects <BR>too close to it. <i>&#40;back of business

    get the black on the envelope to work properly is to print and then convert into
    envelopes. Alot more expensive. Same holds true for your bleeds on the letterhead
    and business cards. Also when cutting the business cards with the knock out type
    so close to the edge you will have alot of waste and the overs will cost alot
    once again. I would suggest showing your designs to a printer and maybe get some
    feedback on how to make them work with in a resonable budget.
