body: I'm looking for high-resolution facsimiles of music typesetting by Ottaviano
  Petrucci and his contemporaries. Whole pages, excerpts, paper editions or digital,
  whatever. Important is the hi-res suitable for a font production. There are a few,
  even nonprofit on-line resources, but they're mostly of shitty quality and printed
  reproductions are really tough to find. Does anybody of you guys know of some internationally
  accessible publisher, bookstore or institution serving such material? I would appreciate
  really any hint. Thanks.
