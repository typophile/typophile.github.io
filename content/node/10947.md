  body: No, I&#39;m pretty sure the font has the circles and stuff. I&#39;m sure I
    just saw it recently, too. Damn it all. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have more time
    to look for it.

  body: I didn&#39;t get it in my email and only saw it after I followed one of the
    posts after I had posted mine. I hadn&#39;t said anything about it earlier because,
    well, in my abject shame and embarrassment I just wanted to forget the whole thing.
    Thanks a lot for reminding me. I&#39;m going home. I know all the fonts there.

    it hard to buy Image Club fonts, but that page  <BR>can hardly be legal.
