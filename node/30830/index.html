  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">this might be a very rookie question...

i'm working with the 1000 em size. as with x-height and Cap height etc, is there overlap and underlap for optics within the em square, or does the absolute bottom of this em square equal the absolute bottom of where something like the descender of the lowercase y might dip -10 points below

hope this makes sense...

The right term is  overshoot (baseline, x-height, cap height overshoot) </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Will is not asking about overshoot as optical compensation, but rather whether you can have your ascender + descender extend beyond 1000. The answer is yes, you can. You can also, as you say, have your descenders actually go 10 units below your specified 'descender line'. 

But then you have to live with the consequences. These may be that your font will have descenders crashing into ascenders on the next line. Or ascenders or descenders that will be cut off and not appear on screen or in print. 

These things depend on the application and what the user does. 

To avoid problems, I believe that most fonts keep the ascender + descender 1000 or less, and the upper case diacritics below a line 200 units above the ascender--as the usual default line gap is 20%.

This is just to stay out of trouble. 

Are you doing a script face? Others may give you fuller answers about script fonts, Arabic, etc., and when and how to violate what most fonts do. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the response. I've worked on a few a letters here and there in the past as display stuff for a quick job but now I find myself in the pits fighting with a full-on font and realize it's all new ground when it comes to the em square and sizing things correctly. needless to say I've already made a few fatal errors, but we learn from the mistakes and helpful friends on typophile.com

i'm currently working on something of a rather bland text sans. as I've printed samples out thus far, I've realized it's not bland at all but that's hard to tell one letter at a time. 

take a look. no critique desired. just take a friendly glance over my shoulder[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_6284.jpeg]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, on second thought, my response should have been: the question confuses me :)

Will, when you say the em square what do you mean? The body size and so top and bottom of the em square as taken by InDesign would start at the top of the ascender line and go 1000 units below. 

Is that what you mean? If so, then overshoot and undershoot are not relevant to that. If you are referring to something else, then another anwer is in order, such as David's. If you are asking about overshoot for optical compensation, I believe most fonts would have more than what you show in your 'a'. Also the left side bearing would  not normally be smack against the loop of the a. Just open some fonts you admire that resemble yours, and check on what they do. </div>
