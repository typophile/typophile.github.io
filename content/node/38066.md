body: I was able to get help from Stephen for 3 of the 4 fonts I am looking to ID.  Thanks!  Does
  anyone recognize this last one.  It is quite unique I believe with the top of the
  "n" rounded and the "e" which does not connect.  Thanks again.

  body: It's hand crafted i guess. Compare both (i)'s and (n)'s, they are different.

  body: Please do not post font identification requests in your personal blog. Nobody
    will find it here. We have a dedicated <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/29">Type
    Identification Board</a> for those.
