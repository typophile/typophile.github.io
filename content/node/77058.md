  body: "the characteristics are difficult to define at such a size, such as the top
    serif on the <strong>A</strong>... that's the most unique one i see. a scan at
    a higher resolution will help.\r\n\r\nhaving the high x-height to cap-height ratio
    that it does,\r\ni suggest Caxton (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/caxton/)\r\nbut
    check out these others too:\r\nDiaconia Old Style (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/diaconia-old-style/)\r\nWilliams
    Caslon http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/williams-caslon-text/\r\n\r\nmy
    initial guess was a version of Caslon, but look at your font's bowl of the <strong>B</strong>
    and x-height of the <strong>b</strong> and <strong>d</strong>. also, i can't tell
    if the bar of the <strong>t</strong> is at a tilt or not."
