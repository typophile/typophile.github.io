body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\nI'm searching a font without closed counters for a quite
  weird laser-cutting project. In particular, I need something like the [[http://www.dafont.com/fortunata.font|Fortunata]]
  \ font by Balint Erdosi but in a Sans Serif style. Can you suggest any?\r\n\r\nI
  have to laser-cut a quite large amount of ID plates and our CAD/CAM program is forcing
  us to manually remove the counters from each and every closed letter (P, Q, B, etc.).
  This is a slow and painful task even in a regular project but in this case it could
  kill the entire project because our plates are serially numbered: we would have
  to repeat the same manual clean-up for each and every plate of a virtually infinite
  sequence of plates. As a consequence, we do have to find (or create...) a font that
  does not require this manual clean-up.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Fortunata is not the
  right font for us because we need a highly-readable San Serif one (as usual for
  ID plates).\r\nEven worse, we cannot use one of our usual stencil fonts, like Boston
  Traffic or Stencilla, because the text has to be cut away from its original metal
  sheet and soldered to another support, where it must appear as embossed (raised)
  to resist to paint, grease, dirty and so on.\r\n\r\nWe will use capital letters
  and numbers, only. No need for lowercase letters, italics or anything else.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestion? Any easily readable font for such a project?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\n\r\nPS:
  My problem is quite similar to the one faced a few years ago by Grant Dunlop and
  explained by himself in this post: [[http://typophile.com/node/20375]].  "

  body: "@riccard0: yes, I think this is a good description of our needs. We need
    to have each glyph in a single piece. Actually, we would like to have the whole
    text in a single piece, by sitting the individual glyphs on a common baseline.
    More precisely, we would like to have our 3D CAD project cleanly split between
    a single-piece foreground (the plate text) and a disposable, single-piece background
    (the mask with the empty space and the counters). This would ease our work a lot.\r\n\r\nA
    possible example is [[http://www.dafont.com/kenteken.font|Kenteken]]. Look at
    the open-counters O and R, for example. Unfortunately, Kenteken still has closed-counters
    letters (B, D and Q, for example).\r\n\r\nBTW, we tried with a few common stencil
    typefaces (like: [[http://www.dafont.com/stencilla.font|Stencilla]], for example)
    and they did not do the job. \r\n\r\nAs you noted, in a stencil typeface the text
    is usually composed by the cuts (or holes) that you make in a mask (the stencil
    itself) and each glyph is composed by a variable number of separated elements.
    This would be a big problem for us because we would be forced to re-assemble each
    glyph from it parts on the new support and solder each fragment of each glyph
    to the common support individually. A painful puzzle for our installers.\r\n\r\nAt
    the moment, we are also looking at [[http://www.dafont.com/iarnold.font|iArnold]].
    As you can see, all of the text sits on a common baseline that act as the linking
    element but, still, we do not have a single-block mask. The counters are still
    separated elements. We would have to open each closed counters before using this
    typeface, not mentioning the fact that we would also have to convert it from its
    outline style to a solid (or \"filled\") one before using it to generate solid
    metal parts.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and your attention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
