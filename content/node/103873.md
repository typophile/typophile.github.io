    document has an embedded Type 1 font called "MinionPhoneticPro".  But I have never
    heard of it before....

    the pdf is an article published in the <em>Journal of Greek Linguistics</em>,
    John Benjamins Publishing Company. The <a href=\"http://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/jgl/main\">link
    on the John Benjamins' site</a> says \"no longer our product\"; the journal is
    now published by Brill.\r\n\r\nAs for the font, I find it unfortunate that even
    Acrobat Professional does not allow us to see the font copyright, all we can see
    is the font names. If I generate a Postscript from the pdf, I get the following

      you can:\r\n1. Open the Preflight panel. (Exact location in the menus depends
      on version and sub-version of your Acrobat.)\r\n2. Wait for Preflight panel
      to load.\r\n3. Wait for Preflight panel to initialize.\r\n4. Wait for Preflight
      panel to display.\r\n5. Click \"Options\" in the right hand corner.\r\n6. Select
      \"Create Inventory\" from the menu.\r\n7. Switch off any items you are not immediately
      interested in.\r\n8. Click OK, then wait some more while a detailed PDF is created.\r\n\r\nThe
      plus point is that this PDF is <em>extremely</em> detailed ... except, after
      all this waiting, I see it displays lots of font information except the Notice.
      Hmmm ... Second attempt:\r\n\r\n1. Open the Preflight panel (then wait, etc.)\r\n2.
      Click \"Options\" in the right hand corner.\r\n3. Select \"Browse Internal Structure
      of all Document Fonts\" -- a treeview dialog opens\r\n4. Open the sub-tree \"MinionPhoneticPro\"\r\n5.
      Open the sub-tree \"Internal Structure\"\r\n6. Open the sub-tree \"Font\" (!)
      -- and there is the Notice."

    <strong>for you own use</strong>, that's how you do/get them.

    you need? As been discussed before (http://typophile.com/node/58725 and the two
    threads mentioned therein), IPA base characters borrow heavily from Latin and
    Greek and can be constructed from the basic set in Minion Pro (a process which
    I call \"pilfering parts\")."

    use\" is a better way of putting it. Adobe says you can hire someone to do it
    for you. On the other hand, they (the hiree?) can't \"distribute\" their work.
    I suppose it needs to be done afresh each time? Who knows the minds of lawyers?
    \r\n\r\n& \"part pilfering\" is a good way to put it."

    the ugly long s \"\u222B\", which was created by mirroring the curve of the Minion

    such a treatment with grace! --, so I repurposed the huge bowl of the \"f\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/esses_3579.png]\r\n\r\nIt

    that typeface! Though, probably, some purist who knows a lot about creating phonetic
    fonts might say that it is all wrong.\r\n\r\nI was just hoping, Theunis, that
    this is available for purchase, I kept thinking that Minion <em>must</em> have
    a fuller IPA character set somewhere, so it is a bit disappointing to learn that
    it is purposely built for that linguistics journal.\r\n\r\nI guess that what you
    all say about Adobe licences is why the firm that designed Duden Aussprachew\xF6rterbuch
    could change Kepler and creatic the phonetic set. I am forgetting the name, but
    I know they have a website. The name is on the first pages of the dictionary."
