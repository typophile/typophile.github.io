  body: Miles, I believe some of these drawings are reproduced in Walter Tracy's book
    <em>Letters of Credit</em>. David R. Godine's paperback edition even has some
    of them <a href="http://www.godine.com/isbn.asp?isbn=1567922406">on the cover</a>.

  body: "Miles, once in a while the UCLA library will mess up. Today was such a case:
    they didn't process my request so the book (which is stored at an off-library
    archive) was not there for me to pick up. It will be there from tomorrow, but
    I'm not sure how soon I'll get back there. Eventually (maybe even as soon as the
    end of this month) I will get it though.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime if you plan
    on picking up that copy on auction let me know.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I'd say. But that IS the starting price. And I can't tell if there's a reserve.\r\n\r\n*

    Of course, that was not Rudolf Koch who invented them. What is the earliest polygram
    on record? Have there been any Renaissance treatises on the construction of letters
    using polygrams?"
