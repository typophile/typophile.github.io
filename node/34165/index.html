<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Please can we not have another war on this thread either :D What do you use and how effective is it? i personally feel that a Mac gives me more speed and freedom to work effectively, being wireless too, I can connnect to the Internet at my local university too anywhere and everywhere. Do you think PC gives enough speed and storage. Prove me wrong if you have to! :D Tell me more, tell me more... :D</div>

<div class=commentbody>You can't raise that topic without starting a war. It's already been covered here, quite recently, do a search and find that thread. It was within the last few weeks.
Found it: http://typophile.com/node/32531
For the record I use a Mac.
I was using my mother's PC last week for internet stuff and found it ugly and cumbersome (not the machine, which was a cute little Dell) but the OS. </div>

<div class=commentbody>There are many things to like about Macs over PCs, but storage and wireless capability are not particularly among them. (Nor is "speed" in any literal sense - do you mean that you are or feel you are more efficient?)

<div class=commentbody>Like I said in the previous thread, this is like asking what brand of chisel Michelangelo used.
Personally, I use a PC. I could probably switch to a Mac with no great loss of productivity. It's not the computer, it's what you do with it. Many bad designers use Macs. Many good designers use Macs. Many bad designers use PCs. Many good designers use PCs. Obviously the brand of computer being used has no bearing on quality of design.
Wireless access, speed, and storage capabilities are not specific to any brand of computer. A Mac could have a smaller hard drive than a PC, or vice versa.
I don't see why this debate keeps coming up over and over again. If you work better on a Mac, then use one. If you work better on a PC, then use one.

I've got four computers: 3 Macs and 1 PC. One Mac is really really old, and kinda stooopid, which leaves me with two Macs and 1 PC. Today I like this Mac. Tomorrow, I might like the PC. If I'm in the mood.</div>

Well, it depends on what you're going to do with it.
If you're comparing hardware, then you need to realize that it's not a PC vs. Mac issue. It's an Apple vs. Dell vs. HP. vs. Sony vs. Lenovo vs. Gateway vs. etc vs. etc vs. etc
And then you have to compare the multitude of models available by each company.
In terms of the operating system, Windows and OSX and Linux are about 90% the same. They all do the basic same things, albeit in slightly different ways.
In terms of software availability, again, 90% of the tools an average graphic designer would use are available on either Windows or OSX platforms (or there's an equivalent for either one).
In the end, if you are truly looking for a comparison, then you need to tell us your requirements for a machine. Based on that, then we can give you specific pros and cons.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dearest Miss Giggles
I'd suspect agencies use PC over Mac mainly because the hardware is cheaper, the software is better understood by the techs, etc. Mainly economics.
Apple does not hold anywhere near the market share that the PC/Microsoft does, and in the late 90s was almost a goner.
I've been working with computers since 1970. I was using mini-computers and the internet in 1975. In 1985 I was setting type on proprietary systems. In 1990 I was introduced to the Mac. While I have used PCs and my wife has one and swears by them, no way in hell I would use anything other than an Apple product.
They aren't necessarily expensive. I just buy used machines and gut them out. New processor, max memory, hard drive controller, video card, media ports; whatever it takes to get it to where it needs to be to function on a par with the newer than the newest. Cheaper and far more efficient than buying a junk new PC. The Mac OS is friggin unbelievably rock solid.

<div class=commentbody>While the debate remains 'which of the two options is the best' (the one with the 95% market share or the one with the 5% market share) people will remain distracted from the real issue, the fact that there are only two choices.
At least there are choices other than Ford and Chevy, or Coke and Pepsi - can't think of anywhere else (except government) where there are only two serious options. But it could be worse, take creativity software, is there any serious competition for CS?
