    Type-ID Requests\" or something like that.\r\n\r\nCome on, Rockberto, you should
    at least try and put some work into it and do some research yourself. All the
    resources are mentioned in the Typowiki (and no, I am not going to provide a link
    to that).\r\n\r\n___\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
