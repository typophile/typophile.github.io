body: "I have seen that there are a few authors that frequent these boards and want
  to share some frustration with them and everyone else. I have also noted the comments
  from those who have tried to explain the situation from the publishers point of
  view \u2014 I am trying hard to sympathise.\r\n\r\nHere is the situation. I have
  just finished two books: one is technical and I think the publisher will be ok with
  it being set using LaTeX and some decent font (they publish a lot of maths/science
  books so they are used to that sort of thing). But the other book is for a more
  general student market: the U.S. college scene in fact. I have sent that to a number
  of British academic publishers and have had a very warm reception thus far. Very
  gratifying! Except that I really want the book to look good and would like to set
  it myself, because I know that if I don\u2019t they are going to set it in Word.
  Word \u2192 pdf \u2192 printer seems to be the standard workflow. Yesterday I sent
  one particular publisher\u2019s editor (who has seemed pretty keen to this point,
  and had just asked for the manuscript to be resent in Word format) a nice letter
  offering to set the book myself at no cost to them so that the book will look nice
  (it already looks pretty good, though not perfect). I suggested that if the problem
  was the editor\u2019s need to work in Word that perhaps some workaround could be
  found. \r\n\r\nI received back very promptly a \u2018No it has to be in Word\u2019,
  with the suggestion that they would indeed just use that to send to a printer (there
  was no comment that they would output from anything else). It was tart and suddenly
  unfriendly.\r\n\r\nI find it pretty hard to understand publishers who take the attitude
  that an inferior output is really in their interests. If they used professional
  designers and compositors on tap (as U.S. publishers do) then I could understand
  their annoyance with authorial intrusion, but British academic publishers often
  don\u2019t do that (even those at the highest level).\r\n\r\nFor me, I suspect,
  outputting from a Word file may be a deal-breaker. I can feel my heels beginning
  to dig in.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thought 1. What does your contract say? If you can insert something into
    the paper work along the lines of getting approval of final output you could be
    onto a winner - keep rejecting their PDFs until they meet your standards - eventually
    they'll either meet your standard or they'll cave and let you design it. \r\n\r\nThought
    2. \u201CYesterday I sent one particular publisher\u2019s editor.\u201D Well,
    editors like to be able to, er edit. Word is a pretty good tool for editing \u2013
    PDF, InDesign, XPress not so much.\r\n"

  body: "Thought 3. Putting yourself in the shoes of the publisher \u2013 they probably
    get book design offers all the time from authors. Everyone thinks they\u2019re
    a graphic designer right (eg Elizabeth Kucinich). So reeling off the names of
    published titles you\u2019ve designed along with references from the publishers
    you\u2019ve worked with in the past who let you design your books might have the
    desired effect. Approach it like an interview for a book-design job. "

  body: "From the point of view of someone who works for a publisher: I think it highly
    unlikely that they are going to set it directly in Word. But publishers do need
    to do a lot of batting manuscripts about internally for various production processes
    before they get given to the typesetters to import into whatever system they're
    using. And it's at these early stages that they need submitted files to be in
    Word, so that <em>everybody</em> involved can open them up and do whatever they
    need to (be it editing or simply extracting information for their production workflow
    databases), and they don't want to have to be able to deal with loads of different
    file types from authors of different backgrounds, interests and levels of technical/typographical
    competence. \r\n\r\nIf you got the \"suggestion that they would indeed just use
    that to send to a printer\", then probably either (a) the person you told you
    that didn't know the internal processes very well, or (b) they simplified what
    they told you because they're more used to dealing with dippy authors than savvy
    ones. \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nEver since
    I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working."

  body: I think it is at least possible that you and the publisher are misunderstanding
    each other. My publisher did all the editing in Word (I used Pages, but made sure
    to export to Word every time I sent them a new iteration). Then they set the layout
    in regular page-layout software. I would get to final text, then see what the
    page layouts they run by you are actually like. You could also ask that they use
    a certain designer (subject to their approving of the design), and if that designer
    is one of your friends, you would naturally have a lot of input. The friend could
    even act as nothing more than a front for you, and your design ideas! Anyway,
    don't panic yet.
