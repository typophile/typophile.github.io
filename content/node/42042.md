  The release of Leopard seems to me to have broken support for type 1 fonts with
  custom tables, for example and most notably 'Expert' fonts (you know, how we got
  optical small caps and old-style figures before OpenType ...)\r\n\r\nSymptom-wise,
  it's pretty much what happened with 10.3.5, which was fixed in 10.3.6, so I'm holding
  out for another cure. Hopes of that arriving with 10.5.2 weren't fulfilled. I don't
  know if this is in hand (I filed a bug report, but it was a bit sketchy) or not,
  but some fix some time not too far down the line would be much appreciated ..."

    months ago.\r\n\r\nThe problem I am experiencing since upgrading to OS X 10.5
    (and then to 10.5.2) is that not all characters from \"Expert\" fonts display.
    I am trying to use old style numbers from two expert fonts (NicolasJensonSG and
    Centaur Expert MT) and some of the old style numbers show and some don't. All
    the numbers worked just fine in 10.4.11.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    contribute to the problem.)

    fonts just to get the old style numbers in Finale ( a music notation program).
    The old style numbers are broken in other programs as well. \r\n"

    licensed the fonts. Wish I had better suggestions.

  body: "\"type 1 fonts with custom tables\"\r\n\r\nI just wanted to note that Type
    1 fonts don't have any tables, custom or otherwise.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking maybe
    you mean custom encodings? But the expert set is a standardized encoding rather
    than custom. So perhaps \"uncommon encodings\" would be the phrase one wants to
    use.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
