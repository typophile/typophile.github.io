body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI've used Pill Gothic OTF for a customer last year (who has
  bought the font from Veer) with InDesign CS2 and had no problems with Small Caps.
  Now making a new project for this particular customer, the Opentype Small Caps function
  in InDesign CS3 won't work. InDesign doesn't react in any way. What's really strange
  is that the document from last year opens correctly with OTF Small Caps. Does anyone
  know of a bug in InDesign CS3 within Small Caps? Thanks in advance. \r\n(Mac, 10.5.2,
  Indesign CS3, Preferences deleted without effect)"

  body: "I saw this happen to an old version of Minion Pro. When I changed the <em>language</em>
    to anything else than English, small caps and a few other niceties failed.\r\nIt
    took me several years to find out. I discovered that in that version of Minion,
    there were definitions for a lot of OpenType options as well as sub-definitions
    for a few languages. The creator forgot to include all OpenType features for all
    languages ...\r\n\r\nYou can try if setting the language to \"[None]\" in ID solves
    it. If not, you'll have to check the font file if it contains anything strange.
    Or (more feasable) contact your font vendor and ask if it's a known issue."

    Seems like someone forgot to include sub-definitions for german. InDesign was
    the culprit, but the font is convicted, what a drama\u2026\r\n;-)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Miguel,\r\n\r\nI'm sure it must have been the one that originally came with
    InDesign CS. After installing CS3, I ran into troubles with the small caps and
    -- surprisingly -- with some accent characters of which ID thought they were there
    in the text, but did not show up in the Glyph window. As the PDF export failed
    miserably for these files, at that time I finally thought of checking font versions,
    and found the Minion supplied with CS3 was a newer and better one. Replacing them
    in my system solved all weird probs instantly.\r\n\r\nI've scanned my hard disk
    for the 'old' version, and I think I still have one. See this (composited) screenshot
    of its properties.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minion_5886.PNG]\r\n\r\nNotice
    how for German the only feature is \"Discretionary\" (a few of the other languages,
    such as SRB and MOL only contain \"locl\"). My new Minion is a version 1.015,
    and that has full tables for all languages.\r\n\r\nFYI, the discretionary ligatures
    are here defined as\r\n\r\nsub c h by c_h\r\nsub c k by c_k\r\n\r\nand these do
    not appear in any of the other sets. The new Minion contains these same ligatures,
    also for German only, <em>as well as</em> all other standard sets."

  body: "... rereading my last post, I wondered if I got my version numbers right.\r\n\r\nIn
    case you didn't notice, what I call \"old\" is really v1.021 (14 Oct, 2002), and
    \"new\" is v1.015 (20 May, 2005). I'm 100% sure, by now I;ve <em>triple checked</em>.\r\n\r\nSomeone
    at Adobe made a foo-bar :-) (Miguel, I hope you were not in charge of this versioning.
    If so, apologies.)\r\n\r\nAn interesting observation is that I couldn't get my
    personal, old, IDCS to get it to display wrong. Derya noticed the same phenomenon
    -- it <em>worked</em> in CS (and probably in CS2 as well, I've used it for ages
    at work), and failed only with the advent of CS3. I would rather call it a bug
    in the older CSes, since, judging by the feature table, it does indeed work as
    advertised in CS3 -- though not as meant (a very important distinction)."

  body: "Theunis, thanks a lot for the info.\r\n\r\nThe bug is in the fonts, not in
    InDesign. What happens is that prior to CS3, InDesign payed no attention to the
    instructions in the font targeted at specific languages. So once IDCS3 started
    parsing those instructions, the bugs in the fonts surfaced.\r\n\r\nThose buggy
    fonts were incorrectly built due to a misinterpretation on how to write and implement
    OT feature code. You know, back in 2002 OpenType was in its infancy, so some things
    were not as clear as they are nowadays. And the apps available at the time did
    not exercise all the font's capabilities, so that bug passed unnoticed. It also
    proves once more that, \"If it's not tested, assume it's broken\".\r\n\r\n> <em>In
    case you didn\u2019t notice, what I call \u201Cold\u201D is really v1.021 (14

    that's strange. I joined Adobe in April'06, so I can't be blamed for that one
