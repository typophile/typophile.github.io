I don't think you believe that yourself. The new design isn't good, but certainly less cluttered than the old design. Regardless of opinions, the new design is objectively better.
<p>The use of the hyphen instead of the en-dash in the new design really frustrates me though. I tend to forgive the city&rsquo;s sign shop on such practices (though even then I get frustrated by street signs every day), though Pentagram should know better. Actually I think this is unforgivable for any sign maker.</p>
<p>This is going off-topic, but look at what I recently observed in a Vodafone store:
<img src="/images/old-images/IMAG3673_4667.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I informed one of the workers about the mistake and she giggled and responded &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do that&rdquo;. Obviously not, but could you at least report it to your manager? I don&rsquo;t necessarily need to get it fixed, but I can&rsquo;t stand the fact that no one reports these mistakes so they often go largely unnoticed by most people. With the upside-down apostrophe though, I&rsquo;m sure most people will feel there is something off about it. Certainly if they compare it to the apostrophe on the left wall of the store, which is the right side up.</p>

<p>Yep. But I remember years ago when a design firm I worked for designed some signs for the city (for a special event). We went to the city&rsquo;s sign shop to exam them. The foreman said &ldquo;You can look at them but we&rsquo;re not changing a damn thing!&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t understand how people can do a serious job and not care at all about the quality. I have higher expectations of people who work with type every day. I don&rsquo;t know how long the guy who put the apostrophe upside-down in the Vodafone store has been applying lettering, but if you can&rsquo;t get this right, perhaps it&rsquo;s not the job for you. I know I&rsquo;m a perfectionist, which tends to frustrate a lot of people, but it infuriates me when people just don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>A while ago I was following a lecture and I noticed the guy in front of me was designing some kind of advertisement on his laptop and I saw he used hyphens where he should be using dashes. I told him he was using the wrong glyphs and told him how to type the en-dash. He gave me 5 seconds to communicate that information and when he still didn&rsquo;t get it to work within those 5 seconds, he told me &ldquo;Never mind that&rdquo;. What the hell? I&rsquo;m really suppressing an urge to type in all-caps here! He wants to be a graphic designer; he should care! If someone points out a mistake to me, I make sure to acknowledge it and learn from it. I don&rsquo;t give up after seconds and tell myself it&rsquo;s not important. If I didn&rsquo;t know about the correct use, I probably don&rsquo;t have any insight on how important it is anyway. But either way, importance shouldn&rsquo;t be a consideration. You should do it right, even if you&rsquo;re the only one in the world who will notice. At least respect yourself as a designer. If you don&rsquo;t care, don&rsquo;t expect me to take you seriously.</p>
