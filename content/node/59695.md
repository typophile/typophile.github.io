  body: "James, are you saying that all it will take is some pioneering leadership
    from a group (design company + client + foundry) that brings visibility to a particular
    method? And that method will then become the precedent necessary to drive adoption?
    \r\n\r\nIf that's what you're saying, I could buy that. It's certainly happened
