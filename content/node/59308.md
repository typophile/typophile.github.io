  body: "Thanks, I have to admit I didn't see it at first, but now that you mention
    it does have some emigre-ness to it. However, I did went through their catalogue,
    and didn't seem to find a match. Arbitrary by Keedy (attached to the original
    post) was the closest, but I don't believe this is it. Maybe a customization/cleanup?\r\n"

  body: "Oh, duh! I see the explanation in the post before mine. Sorry.\r\n\r\nThe
    original looks very familiar, but I think it may be because it resembles Monotype's
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/ocean-sans-mt/|Ocean Sans]], which I used
    to use a lot. The biggest obvious difference is the pointed N and M.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "In looking at the Emigre fonts I noticed Ottomat has some similarity to the
    sample (which I now believe must be custom lettering), and so I used it as the
    starting point for a crude simulation. I admit to having no skill at manipulating
    outlines, but that is what I tried, using Illustrator. It might fool someone in
    a very dark room :)\r\n\r\nThe top sample is the original image posted.\r\n\r\n-
