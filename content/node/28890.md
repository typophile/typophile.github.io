  being deeveloped. Its called \"212 Lounge\". Upscale, wealthy bay area neighbourhood,
  modern yet classically touched.\r\n\r\nAnything goes :)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you're going to use type for the logo, it seems like it would be a good
    idea to not add an extra abbreviation. I don't think most of these work very well,
    mostly because the type looks dated and more appropriate for something on the
    east coast. Unless this place is built into a Victorian, they just don't work.\r\n\r\nThe
    idea of breaking up two one two with ninety degree rotations is nice, but you're
    breaking it up into two twelve with the numeric versions.\r\n\r\nIf I was going
    to pick a favorite, it would be the middle-bottom. It's not as dated as the serif
    designs, and it's not as corny as the stepped design, but it isn't especially
    compelling, either."

  body: "I suppose I should of done a better job explaing myself. Your note of it
    hinting at an old East Coast bar is probably a good way of explaing the feel that
    I want to get. This is a makeshift Identity project for school. The establishment
    will be aged to fit like a high life New York (in opposition to its local San
    Francisco) esque bar, offering a taste of that sort of lifestlyle in a small eastbay
    community. This is one part of the logo, with various other marks as works in
    progress. \r\n\r\nI appreciate your comments, any new directions to venture would
    be great.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "You obviously know how to make things look nice, but this falls into the
    trap common with design students (and design professionals) is that it doesn't
    dig deep enough. Your decisions seem arbitrary and not rational.\r\n\r\nDig deeper.\r\n\r\nThe
    concept is there. A New York feel in the Bay area. Research. What makes New York,
    New York? What kind of typography is associated with New York?\r\n\r\nNew York
    is very different than San Francisco. Make us <em>believe</em> we're in New York."

  body: "Good call on using an extended font for the word \"lounge\" in the first
    of your new samples. The compressed, upright letters of your earlier versions
    visually contradict a literal meaning of the word.\r\nThe rotated \"2\" doesn't
    really read in the negative form without being told it's there. It's a strong
    shape, but it isn't communicating what it's supposed to."

  body: I wouldn't over think this one, its just a bar. Go with an elegant 212 and
    if you have to use the word lounge make it small. This is a case where you aren't
    really selling anything like food. Its just about atmosphere and that will be
    conveyed by the interior design more than any logo you could develope.

    body: "Thanks for the over thinking comment. I really found myself limited with
      the different directions to take the logo. The location and atmosphere speaks
      for itself as does the int. design. Despite the decoration, the teacher chose
      the flourished form. Ill post some more final versions soon. All much appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Your second set, #2 has much more of a 'NY/Gotham' vibe to it. Big city.
    A bit art deco.\r\n\r\nThe others, as stated, have more of an 1800's victorian
    era vibe to them. Not quite sure if that's what you want."
