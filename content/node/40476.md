  body: I'll bet it's pre digital. You'll get kind of close with Ray Larabie's <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/forgotten-futurist/">Forgotten Futurist</a>
    or maybe Font Bureau's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/garage_gothic_bold/">Garage

  body: "hey marten, \r\nyes it's definitely \"pre-digital\". those plates were used
    in the 1890s in france. \r\nbut thanks a lot for the idea of using garage gothic
    bold, this font comes really close, although the \"ampersand\", the roundings
    and length vary. "

    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/sui-generis/">Sui Generis</a>

  body: Oh! So that's the same guy?! I've actually come across SMeltery a couple of
    times before. I think he has an interesting approach on type. His Sans Merci was
    up in the quiz a couple of months ago...
