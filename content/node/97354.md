  body: It looks like you don't actually have letter outlines in those slots (since
    the x appears gray rather than black in the font window). Did you accidentally
    design letters in the mask layer rather than the main layer (or accidentally switch
    the layers)?

  body: "I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but have you checked the manual?\r\n\r\nGranted,
    the manual is long and of limited usefulness overall, but you should at least
    read enough to get a basic orientation. That is what it\u2019s there for, to help
    beginners get started.\r\n\r\nFrom the gray appearance of your \u2018x\u2019 in
    the Font window (in the background of your image), it looks like you might have
    drawn your outlines in the Mask layer, which won\u2019t display in the Metrics
    window. You should be drawing in the Outline layer.\r\n\r\n[ Edit: looks like
    Craig beat me to it, while I was previewing ;-) ]"

  body: Well gee thanks guys, reading the manual, what a novel idea.  Its only 900
    plus pages long, I said I was VERY new at this........do you remember everything
    you have ever read?  IF I could have found the info in the manual I was looking
    for I would not have posted here.....I have since figured it out but yes I was
    doing something wrong and Eliason, thank you for at least attempting to help and
    not treating me like a moron :)

    large amount. Would you care to discuss Egyptian Religion or the Purkinje Effect?"
