  a scholar critical edition of baroque music (I am using InDesign) and I wish to
  ask a question to the esperts.\r\nI am using Adobe Garamond Premiere as the general
  font for the edition. It's a font I like very much, but there is a single glyph
  I don't like (well, two, in fact), the typographical quotes \xAB \xBB. I find they
  take too much of horizontal space, and I would like to use for them the Bembo Book
  quotes, which I like more.\r\nSo the question is: is it considered acceptable for
  a professional typesetting to mix two text fonts, so that the text is in Adobe Garamond
  Premiere and only the quotes in Bembo Book?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    then go for it.

    fortunately, guillemets lack identifying qualities that would match or mismatch
    other glyphs of a typeface. As long as you are careful to apply them consistently,
    it should work fine. To edit a document littered with brief font changes requires
    you to be mindful, lest you find you've accidentally set one whole sentence in
    Bembo."

  body: "To accomplish this sort of mixing, you might be best served by establishing
    a special character stylesheet for Bembo Book and using this for a GREP style
    within your basal text paragraph stylesheet to restyle all (and only) guillemets
    on the fly. \r\n\r\nYou should be aware that in mixing two faces like this, you
    will lose any kerning pairs between guillemets and adjacent letters, since the
    boundary will now be across fonts. Typically, the guillemets are kerned slightly
    with the top-heavy capitals, at the least. So, for instance, in a sequence like
    <em>\xABTelemann\xBB</em> the first guillemet might not tuck so nicely in with
    the <em>T</em> as it might if set all in a single font. Depending upon the fitting
    of these two fonts, this may or may not present any actual visual detriment."

    so maybe I'd better to stick with Garamond alone, to avoid all risks.\r\n\r\nIn
    a week or so maybe I could post a couple of pages in the Critique section of this
    forum (or is it for fonts critique only?).\r\n\r\nBest."

    to your taste so you don't have to switch fonts (and mess with proper kerning).
    I was once commissioned to add some special characters to Garamond Premier so
    I'm one of the many people here who could carry out such modifications for you:
