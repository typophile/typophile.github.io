  body: "\"Income\" is a version of an extremely popular font of the 1890s and 1900s
    called DeVinne which was sold in many widths and weights. When DeVinne declined
    in popularity the foundries used the name for another design. There are several
    digital fonts that follow the original  DeVinne design but with few exceptions
    they are under other names. \r\nHere is a wide DeVinne by Wooden Type Fonts.:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/de-vinne/\r\nA
    similar narrow font, Romana:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/romana\r\nA middle
    width, Publication JNL:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/publication/\r\nAnother,

  body: "Actually, these 2 samples are not the same font.\r\nFirst one \"rachel\"
    looks defintely to [[http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/t/trooper-roman.html|Trooper
    Roman]] by Dave Trooper to me. The only digitally available reinterpretations
    I'm aware of are [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/toledo|Toledo TS]],
    [[http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Troover.htm|Troover PT]] and Talon Bold
    FBK.\r\nSecond one \"Income\" is either [[http://typophile.com/node/99936|DeVinne]]
    (aforementionned by Don) or [[http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/b/bernase-roman.html|Bernase
    Roman]]. Additional digital alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/hawthorn-lt|Hawthorn
