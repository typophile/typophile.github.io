body: "hello typophiles\r\n\r\nat work we are redesigning the corporate newspaper
  of a very big global company, active in the medical sector.\r\n\r\nat the moment,
  they use the official CD-fonts, namely Minion for text and  minion condensed for
  headlines and Berthold Imago for subheads, and captions and infoboxes.\r\n\r\nneeded:\r\n-
  two typefaces that get then used for headline and body copy, infoboxes and captions.
  normal, bold and italic,  the fonts need char-sets for spanish, german, french and
  english.\r\n- a sans and a serif that work together \r\n- typefaces that dont use
  too much space (the layout has 5 columns, the papersize is only A3)\r\n- style:
  classic but modern, timeless, not trendy and not too playful (no vista, for example
  :))\r\n\r\ndo you have any ideas or thoughts? any help would be greatly appreciated!"

    looked at your fonts before. I love the playful feel of several of them. I love
    Preface and Artefact. To me Brown even has a playful feel. It seemed you could
    also make an extra light for the set.\r\n\r\nWe now return to your regular programming..."

  body: "hmm, its hard to find the right adjectives. maybe less classy? think of weekly
    sunday newspapers, lots of pictures and some color thrown in here and there, but
    still with a strong corporate look.\r\n\r\nthe concept isnt finished and im not
    really involved, and i dont know how much im allowed to talk about it (but my
    coworkers know that i asked here)."

    Vesta</a> and <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-capitolium.html">Capitolium</a>
    could work within your contraints, IMHO.

  body: they are very nice. i like capitolium, but i think esp. the italics are too
    playful (look at the Q for example). (but no, i havent thought of unger before..
    thanks).
