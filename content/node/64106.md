  produce high quality proofs of my work on A4 before i send off to the printer.\r\n\r\nI
  am looking at Dells range of laser printers, I see they all do 600x600dpi any other
  designers out there got any experience with their printers?\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be cool\r\n"

  body: "I'm using a Dell 3110cn. I would say the printer is adequate, but not stellar.
    \r\n\r\nIt's economical to operate, but I find the text is a bit spindly, and
    I can't seem to find any way to adjust the print density the way I could with
    my old LaserJet."
