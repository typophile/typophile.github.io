body: "Hi everyone,\r\nI'm looking for typefaces like these three, if anyone could
  help i'd be really grateful. In the first image it's the red type i'm interested
  in. I'm particularly interested in the grey angular type in the second image, it
  looks custom but if anyone has any ideas for similar typefaces it would be great.\r\nThanks
  in advance[img:sites/default/files/old-images/id_01_4259.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/id_02_3929.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/id_03_4015.jpg]"

  body: "The Red lettering is similar to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typonauten/newsletter/|Newsletter]],
    but the feature I could not match was the numerals, especially the 7 with serifs
    like that. Almost seems to come from another font. Maybe all the numerals are
    from something else. \r\n\r\nIn general, and maybe one reason why you have had
    few comments, all-caps Sans serif fonts are not easy to ID. That angular one is
    admittedly odd, but it looks like an OCR design, and could be an amateur design
    (did you search Dafont?)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
