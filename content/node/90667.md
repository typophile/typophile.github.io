body: "Hello all. \r\n\r\nI have been given the job of trying to give our Board Reports
  a bit of a face-lift (largely on the strength of my desktop wallpaper being 'typographically
  themed' - now I'm in a panic! Our corporate typeface is Helvetica (but the brand
  guide actually endorses the use of Arial due to its ubiquity in most large companies).
  Our MD has said that he doesn't particularly like Arial and would not object to
  some other styles, \"as long as they are easy to read\".\r\n\r\nBoard reports have
  typically been in Arial at 11pt size, with standard page layout of 1inch margins
  all around (something I would also like to change), justified (which has resulted
  some awful looking pages when web addresses have been included). Line spacing has
  varied between 1.25 and 1.5. The software used for producing the reports is the
  standard version of Microsoft Word 2010.\r\n\r\nThis may sound like a daft question
  from an utter newbie (which I am), but: are there any sans-serif fonts that have
  'old-style' figures included as well as the 'lining' type as well? If not, then
  I am guessing that I am after a serif font (slab or otherwise) that can offer this
  option.\r\n\r\nCommercially available fonts as well as 'free' fonts suggestions
  are welcome. Hope that some of you can help."

  body: "Yes.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing if you have Word 2010 you also have Corbel and Calibri,
    both have a \u2018full\u2019 set of figures (proportional & tabular versions of
    lining & old style = 4 sets). Checking in Word 2007, Corbel seems to use proportional
    old style figures by default. (They're both part of the [[http://www.ascendercorp.com/catalog/microsoft/clear-type-font-collection/|ClearType
    Font Collection]], which are almost certainly the most feature-rich faces you
    have on your office comp.)\r\n\r\nThere are [[http://myfonts.us/td-yrrGne|many]]
    other sans-serif fonts with OSF(old style figures) if you want to buy a specific
    one.\r\n\r\nIf your company has a designer, I bet they'd be happy to consult with
    you too."

    The link to the My Fonts website is very useful - there are a bewildering array
    of styles there. I am guessing that those fonts with \"WEB\" next to them are
    primarily designed for web pages rather than printed output."

    well.</em> (Although most of them won\u2019t look anything like intended on Windows.) "

  body: "<strong>@frode frank</strong>\r\nThank you for the clarification, although
    I am a tad mystified as to why fonts won't look anything  like they are supposed
    to on Windows. Is this because the Windows operating system has a problem displaying
    OpenType fonts? Is it something to do with \"hinting\" or the like?"

  body: "Most commercial fonts and faces are targetted at the printing industry which
    regards a resolution of 600&times;600 dpi as shockingly coarse. A computer monitor
    usually has a resolution of 100&times;100 dpi or thereabout. ClearType and similar
    tricks can fake ca. 300&times;100 dpi on a sunshiny day. So, Win or Mac, text
    will rarely look as good on screen as on paper. And, yes, hinting is about nudging
    the font into looking as good as possible on screen.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
    text on screen can be resized and reset to what feels good for <em>you, here and
    now.</em> Rather difficult to do that on paper."
