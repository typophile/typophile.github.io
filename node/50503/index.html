  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm looking for a production technique that uses traditional offset printing with inks that can change color with varying temperatures. Specifically, I'd like to find an ink or process that can be applied invisibly and will appear when heat is applied. Such as a warm breath or touch of a hand.

I've talk to a couple of local printers and they haven't been able to find anything that meets specifically what I'm looking for. There are inks that will go down opaque and have a color and disappear when heat is applied, but that's the opposite of what I'm looking for.

Does anyone know of such a process or where to begin my search?

Thanks,

Jenkin</div>

		<div class="commentbody">hi jenkin
sorry i can't answer your question, but I'm interested in what 
your local printers told you...could you give me the details of
those specific inks?

		<div class="commentbody">This is getting into very specialized territory. One place to start might be to talk to Brady-Palmer, Inc. They are a book jacket & cover printer near New York City. They do amazing things.

http://www.bradypalmer.com/

Also talk to a major ink manufacturer. Find out what their inks can do and then ask them to recommend printers who use those inks. Ask your regular printer who their best ink supplier is.

You will also need to find out if this work needs a special stock.

Keep us posted here.

		<div class="commentbody">This conversation made me think of the old Transformer emblems on the toys. They were black, but after adding heat (your thumb) they would reveal the Transformer's party affiliation. Pretty cool. 

Can I ask what you're designing that would require such a unique technique, or is it hush-hush information?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed, Underware uses it in their Sauna typeface specimen. It was printed by a printer in The Netherlands called [[http://www.ando.eu/|Ando]], in Den Haag (The Hague). So you could either try contacting Underware, or send an email to the printer.

On a sidenote, I've also seen something like it on coffee packaging here in the Netherlands, not too long ago. Somekind of promotional thing where there were blank stickers on the packaging, which you had to stick on the outside of your hot coffee cup and a text would appear. </div>

Hey, Will (or Carl or Chris Slye) -- I think this might have been that Tempranilla we had at that tapas place in Buffalo; does this ring a bell with you?

		<div class="commentbody">Dammit, Kent, you are right once more! I was just going through all the paper I hauled back from Buffalo and I came across the piece with the notation about that wine. I think I can get my hands on it again, and I think it was the Tempranillo. & I have since seen one other wine label with this feature.

@Asvetic: I love the term 'party affiliation' applied to everyone's favourite transforming robots. Republicons vs Autocrats! Genius.
