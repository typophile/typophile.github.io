  target=\"_blank\">Planet typography</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.planet-typography.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Planet typography</a> is a portal dedicated to typefaces and typography
  which proposes a comprehensive directory of links, a webzine which introduces the
  most famous contemporary type designers (in the October issue, Jonathan Hoefler,
  designer of Hoefler text), a typographic manual, a bookshop and a section dedicated
  to the freeware creation.\r\n\r\nThe site was launched in 1999 and is edited by
  a typo addict (but who does not work in the graphic design industry). Its target
  is to educate type users (all of us who have a computer) to the art of type creation
  and to vulgarize its unknown art.\r\n\r\nA new version has been launched in October.\r\n\r\nURL:

    to <strong>Independent</strong>, which is the way it appears in the dictionary."

  body: "Thank you Mr. Loubet del Bayle, I will visit the site in the next weeks.\r\nYou
    might want to rethink the top right grey part of the home page,\r\nin my opinion
    it is weak, and also the part of the 'g' loop in the logo is too fat,\r\nmore
    visible against the white background. Regarding the color-rollover\r\nfor Magazine,
    Manual, &c., I would do the opposite since I cannot read the links.\r\nAlso what
    is the purpose of attaching an image in that size here ?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"
