  body: "Another Graham Meade font is very similar, called <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptSmall5/WorstveldSlingObl.gif\">'Worstveld
    Sling Oblique'</a>. Turns out it's a free font too, which you can get at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheticals/worstveld-sling/\">MyFonts.com</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    couldn't find 'V Hand' Dav, do you have a link? (edit: I found it <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheticals/v-hand/\">here</a>.)\r\n\r\n-
