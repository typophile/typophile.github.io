  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My Ultralight font started showing up in Indesign as Regular today when I generated a new version, and I don’t know why. This is driving me crazy, but from everything I’ve read it seems like it should show up as Ultralight. It shows up just fine in TextEdit.

Here’s the font info and OT info in FLAB (h-scrolling keeps it readable)

		<div class="commentbody">Hi James,
I had to struggle through this some time ago: you should review the family naming procedures for OT in the manual or elsewhere.
If I remember correctly, you form four-member-only subfamilies for PC, so the Family name (Whateley Light) should be repeated in Menu Name, Fond Name should also be Whateley Ultralight, Mac name should be Whateley Ultralight, no checks in italic and bold checkboxes. Then you have to go to Additional OT names and autogenerate them. That's what's missing in your approach I think.

		<div class="commentbody">I think like everyone else I had a nightmare naming my fonts and getting them to work across applications and platforms. I think I finally got to working with the help of Karsten Luecke's PDF on font naming.

<a href="http://www.kltf.de/downloads/FontNaming-kltf.pdf" target="_blank">FontNaming-kltf.pdf</a>

I wrote this script to make the naming easier for myself. It works for Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Thin It, Light It, It, Medium It, Bold It.

Possibly unrelated to your InDesign problem but: This is your UltraLight style as indicated in OT Family Name, PS Font Name and Full Name. However, Family Name is "Whateley Light" and Style Name is "Regular" and Font is italic/Font is bold are unchecked -- so on this level it's effectively "Whateley Light" rather than "Whateley UltraLight". Better rename Family Name to "Whateley UltraLight". Possibly also fill in Mac Name, same content as Full Name.

Toby -- <cite>You haven't filled in the Menu and FOND name, that's why it doesn't work...</cite>

These names will not go into OT font's name table anyway, so no need to bother.

		<div class="commentbody">Im not a Fontnaming-connaisseur, but I think you also have to set a few things in the 'Additional Opentype Names' section. That section does have something to do with Family and Subfamily names, so I think it could affect your problem. If I recall correctly it was:

Additional Opentype Names -> Press the left button (with the arrow and FI, Import Names) -> it then automatically fills in the fields (if you have filled in the Names sections) -> Check if the first line (1 1 0 0) shows the family name (i.e. Whateley), and then you need to change the second line (2 1 0 0, showing only weight now probably) to whatever you have for Full Name. I.e. Whateley-UltraLight. So it becomes 2 1 0 0 Whateley-UltraLight. 
But make sure you have your normal Naming right (see Karsten's post above), otherwise te data that is automatically generated when you press the import button is also wrong.

This comes from that [[http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2843|MSN Groups post]] about Naming posted by Adam Twardoch. If the Additional Opentype Names alone doesn't help, start from step 1 from that MSN Group tutorial.</div>

Well, I see 'Regular' as the Style Name in your first screenshot?

Also make sure to check the Additional OT Names section I mentioned earlier, I had a few times that a wrong style name was still hidden in there (or missing where it <em>should</em> be).</div>

So that isn’t required to be Regular/Bold/Italic/Bold Italic? I thought putting other stuff in there breaks things. And even if I do change it to Ultralight Fontlab changes that to regular when I generate the font.

The "Additional OpenType Names" field is needed if the OpenType family (nameID 16) or subfamily (nameID 17) are to be different than the Windows family (nameID 1) and subfamily (nameID 2). They are indeed going to be different in this case, so they are needed.

The Windows family is what FontLab calls "Family Name" on the first screen. That should be set to Whately UltraLight, not Whately Light. However, this shouldn't cause the problem you're seeing, I don't think.

Whatever family members you are working with, you should put them in a folder together and run the Adobe "CompareFamily" tool on them to see if it pops out any interesting warnings about naming issues either on individual fonts or across the family. If you don't have the AFDKO installed, I'd be willing to do that for you, but I'd need to have the fonts.

Cheers,

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the help, all. Karsten checked out the files and found that the problem was in other members of the family, which was confusing Indesign. 

In the future I think that I’ll assign different family names to each weight and version of my fonts so that I don’t make a mess out of things when testing iterations of my designs. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">At the end you would expect something like this in the Naming Table:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Naming_table_5754.gif]
&nbsp;

And in the CFF Name INDEX something like this:


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CFF_Name_INDEX_3830.gif]
&nbsp;

These are screen dumps of <strong>DTL OTMaster</strong> (OTM), a sophisticated application with a graphical user interface for opening, reviewing, editing and saving tables and glyphs of fonts with a snft file structure, as there are CFF and TTF flavoured OpenType fonts, TrueType fonts and TrueType Collection fonts. OTM is developed by URW++ and the Dutch Type Library and will be released for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux shortly.

By the way, the use of the Windows Full name string / PostScript FontName for the Compatible Full entry here, is a suggestion by Karsten Luecke in the <em>OTM manual</em>, of which he is the author.

The way the entries for the Name Table and CFF Name INDEX are displayed in the dialogs, further interpreted and stored by font editors, differs. In DTL FontMaster the naming information is stored in a text file (UFM), separately from the glyph data. The most common Name ID entries are supported by the UFM dialogs, but all entries can be added directly to the UFM file, like this:

These entries supersede any related name strings in the rest of the UFM file. The UFM files are connected by file names to the glyph data and can be freely altered and copied and connected to other glyph databases. This way renaming and using the name table entries for other font files is fairly simple. More information on this subject can be found <a href="http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/PDF/ATypI08/Name_table_entries.pdf">here</a>.</div>
