  body: "Couldn't find any exact matches; suspect it is heavily customized.\r\n\r\nClosest
    I could find for recreating the look is All Round Gothic Bold (customize the J,
    change the angle of the terminals on the C):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/all-round-gothic/\r\n\r\nThe
    free Google font Montserrat Bold also comes close, with an alternate A with a
    rounded top and a J with a left pointing serif that could be modified...."

    work pretty well without too much work (reworking /J top).
