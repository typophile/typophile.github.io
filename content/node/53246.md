  found only a tiny amount of works on this subject, and only about contemporary redesigns.
  Can any of you help me on this? \r\nI'm particularly interested on typography of
  old dictionaries and the organization of information in them... i've tried - with
  no sucess - to find anything close to this, but nothing on bookshops, nothing on
  libraries, nothing on the internet...\r\nThank you for all the help you can \"post\"
  here :)\r\n\r\n(P.S. sorry for my rough english...)"

  body: "Thankyou Alessandro! i'm still trying to figure out what TeX is... but thanks
    anyway, i'll keep investigating the website :)\r\n\r\nwhat i'm trying to find
    realy is information, as for example: about writers, editors, typographers, type
    casts, 1st printed dictionary (sorted by country)...etc., or at least tips on
    where i can find these kind of info... \r\nSince the printing of dictionaries
    was ordered by the royalty or universities, and under the kings and the church
    permission, and by specific letters men... i was wondering if anyone knew about
    studies beeing developed on this subject... \r\n"
