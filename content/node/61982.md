    In this case, 'squooshed' means flattened/widened.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "i'd have to disagree fellow font-trackers. it's too mid-century for juice,
    looks like something off an old record album. i think it's hand cut rubilith kind
    of stuff and shot directly onto the print plate. \r\n\r\nIn the spirit of unbridled

  body: "Troy, I have to disagree with your assessment. Just because the image is
    not in color doesn't mean it's vintage work. The image below shows the posted
    sample with a sample I just made with ITC Juice widened to 184%.\r\n\r\n- Mike
