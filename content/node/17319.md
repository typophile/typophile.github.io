body: "Hi, I am trying to create a font for a client with the logo in it, so they
  can use the logo in applications that dont support eps/pdf. I have pasted the logo
  into a letter in fontlab, and everything looks great. But when I try to use the
  font (insert the logo into an application by typing the letter) the outlines look
  all jagged. I have attached a screenshot from fontlab and a screenshot from an application
  after the logo has been inserted.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions to make the logo appear
  as it should would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nOystein"

    else will correct me if I'm wrong...

  body: "Ok, thanks Nick, so I'll try to get into the hinting.\u2026\r\nIt might also
    have something to do with the font generation, because it looks just as bad on
    the print as it does on the screen. But what do I know?\r\n"

    errors in Postscript interpreter. I feel I saw the same results in some old version
    of Corel Draw very long ago.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"

    curves?

  body: "No, there's no problem with the placement of the points.\r\n\r\nI made it
    work now by opening a system font I had, and putting my vektor graphics into one
    of the glyphs in the font, and then generating a postscript font.\r\n\r\nIn my
    first attempt I made a new font from scratch, which gave me the results you have
    seen on the attached files.\r\n\r\nSo in my view it has to be something with my
    settings."

  body: "<em>No, there\u2019s no problem with the placement of the points.</em>\r\n\r\nYes
    there is! You need to have your points on the extremes. And you have supuerflous
    points in the middle of curves\u2014where you don't need them. These are probably
    what is causing the distortion of your forms."

  body: Dan's right about the extrema problem, primarily on the s (correct positions
    are marked in red). Also, the connection on the left side of the counter of the
    e does not appear to be smooth; others might not be, as well.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bad_s.gif]

  body: "Thanks for the feedback and suggestions. I don't know much about FontLab
    as you can tell, however, I have some problems with your solution.\r\n\r\nFor
    comparison I have included two screenshots:\r\nOne from the S glyph after opening
    the original font (Klavika) in fontlab,\r\nand the other from the same glyph after
    being outlined in illustrator and then imported into FontLab.\r\n\r\nAs you can
    see; they both have superflous points, and none of them have points on the extremes
    marked by Nick (thanks for the shown example, no disrespect).\r\nHowever, the
    points are not placed on the exact same spot. I agree that this is part of the
    problem, but it's not all.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above:\r\nI made it work by opening
    a system font I had, and putting my vektor graphics (the logo) into one of the
    glyphs in the font, and then generating a postscript font. There's only some problems
    on the far left side of the glyph e and d, where there are two points close to
    eachother.\r\n\r\nAnd if you look at the two pictures on my first post in this
    topic, there has to be something more than the placement of the points for it
    to be that messed up.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.viktig.no/temp/Logo.jpg\">Logo</a>\r\n<a

    Nick, how do you attach images for instant view on a reply?"

  body: "The differences between the two examples you show are utterly immaterial,
    because neither of them is correct Postscript, and <em>that's</em> your problem.
    The laws of Postscript are not as immutable as, say, the laws of physics, but,
    if you break them, they carry a penalty. In this case, lack of points at the extremes
    causes lousy output; non-smooth connections which should be smooth cause lousy
    output; unnecessary points can cause lousy output.\r\n\r\nIf you came to this
    forum for advice, it would be in your best interests to TAKE THE FREAKING ADVICE,
    instead of arguing with it ... unless, of course, you would rather <strong>be
    right</strong> (at least in your own mind) than <strong>get it right</strong>.
    And, right below the box in which you type your comments, there's a single line
    of blue type which says \"Insert image\"...much easier than inserting a link to
    an image residing on a remote website."

    be rude. I came here to learn, not only to be told what's right. As I have pointed
    out, I don't know much about FontLab, just started using it. And I also pointed
    out that I wasn't dissatisfied with your help, I just didn't understand. But I
    guess I'll settle for now\u2026.\r\n\r\nOystein"
