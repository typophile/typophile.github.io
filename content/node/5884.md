  the earth. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41901.jpg"
  alt="font sample"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve used all sorts of little scripts that ask questions
  about serifs and such, but I wasn&#39;t able to find anything close to this.  I
  can provide a few more letters by cropping some more of the logo if necessary. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks for taking a look at this
