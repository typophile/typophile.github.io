body: "Greetings all!\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anyone can point me in the direction
  of some good Chinese fonts. We have the usual suspects that travel with MS Word
  and/or Windows (PMingLiU for instance) but there is at least one character (Unicode
  20B1D) that isn't in that font.\r\n\r\nThe book is a compilation of authors/editors
  and they've used no less that 20 different fonts for all the text, Chinese and otherwise.
  I'm hoping to find something that will have all the characters we need but not look
  like the Heiti fonts that come with the Mac, which is just plain homely.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help you can offer!\r\n\r\nKen\r\n"

    Japanese fonts that is bundled with Mac OS X. In fact, if you use these with the
    Simplified Chinese Hiragino fonts, the style should match closely. U+20B1D is
    mapped to Adobe-Japan1-5 CID+17340, which is included in all Hiragino \"Pro\"
    Japanese fonts."
