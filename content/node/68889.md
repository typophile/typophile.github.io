  body: Perhaps it's an issue with too much whitespace between "podcamp" and "London"?
    Especially considering left /p/s descender that is framing the space on the left
    leaving it sort of flowing out on the right. If you agree, I'd try shrinking "podcamp"
    a bit so that left p's descender would sit between L and O, and right p's - between
    O and N, then nudge "podcamp" up and down and see if it helps.

  body: In that size (!) the fourth one looks the best in my opinion. And in the fourth
    one podcamp should be dragged a very little bit down. Drag the leaf above podcamp
    a little bit to the left, because it looks slightly discentered. (Then it maybe
    needs to be downsized a bit.) And the small leaf at the bottom does not harmony.
    I think I would remove it or select another one.

  body: "My $.02:\r\n\r\n1) Do you really need this much detail in the mark? \r\n\r\n2)
    Not sure about the visual direction/axis the two red leaves/elements open up,
    it doesn't seem very deliberate? At least, I'm thinking they should be the same
    shade of red. But you have these two equally strong elements that pull back and
    forth. I'm probably missing something here, but I don't get what those do, or
    why one wouldn't suffice.\r\n\r\n3) Depending on the size this is going to be
    used at, the small subline either needs some tracking, or should be set larger
    overall. It's already a bit hard to read in the large version you posted (compounded
    by rendering), and becomes rather illegible in the small versions.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    maybe it's just me, but I kinda like the lined-up type, like you had it (so top-left
    in the bottom samples). I don't think that's a problem. I'd maybe just add a little
    more white space between the type and the mark if coherence of text block seems
    to be an issue."

  body: "@Arno Enslin:\r\nThe leaf at the bottom is the conuntries national symbol.
    Can't swap it out with another leaf. \r\n\r\n@altaira:\r\nThe level of detail
    has been fine thus far, lots of confrence swag last year without any problems.
    Anything under an inch, or 30px has an alternative solid shape to use with less
    details inside. The red leafs are the same shade, I think some of the compresion
    has made it look like it isn't. The tagline I agree is rather tough to read at
    most sizes, I try to lose it all together whenever I can get away with it. \r\n\r\nThe
    problem I think I have with the current arangement is the space inbetween the
    p and the n. It's just odd looking too me with the P and L framing the left side
    of the type.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a larger version.\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Current-Ver_3491.png]"

  body: "I'd say the issue is the amount of leaves in the image itself, and the leaves
    beaing very 'heavy' on the right side (not sure how to say it otherwise)\r\n\r\nHave
    you tried to rotate it a small bit ? lengthen the stem of the leaves a small bit
    then and I think it should work a bit better.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure if the
    red leaf has to be repeated, it makes it a bit fussy, as if it shouts 'remember
    me !' I'ts a nice touch but I think it isn't needed, and with such an ornamental
    logo it's better to ditch everything you don't need.\r\n\r\nSo in short: drop
    one of the second red leaves, lose some of the smaller leaves, perhaps even ditch
    the light green color ones totally, rotate it a bit so the balance of the image
    doesn't hang that much to the right.\r\n\r\nActually that wasnt very short but
    I'd think it's a bit clearer.\r\n\r\nI like the design though !"

  body: "The overall shape of the leaves are composed to mimic the shape of the standard
    podcamp logo. Each city take the parent brand and customizes it to represent their
    event. We've also used the mark fairly extensivly at this point in posters, stickers,
    banners, ect. So the mark is set in stone at this point. The type however I was
    worried about.\r\n\r\n@TKDesign: Yep that was me. I also did a new logo for PodCamp
    Montreal but I don't think they'll be using it. Did you attend PCTO?\r\n\r\n"
