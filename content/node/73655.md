  body: Print. And I mean the whole impression of a page. My font behaves like one
    of oldstyle serifs. I don't care of fools, but now - when I found the similarity
    - it's hard for me to introduce some further details (fine tuning), since I am
    affraid of making the similarity deeper.

  body: "Well, for one, the fine tuning could lessen the similarity.\r\nAnd, said
    similarity could well be a selling point after all: there are lots of requests
    for fresher faces which are similar/compatible or have the same feeling of older
    ones."

  body: "You could change the colour by changing the rhythm of the verticals.\r\nThe
    important ratio is the vertical strokes in \"i_n\".\r\nEither they are even, or
    the space inside n is larger/smaller than the space between glyphs.\r\nSo compare
    yours to the \"classic\" and do otherwise.\r\n(Note this difference between Adobe
    Caslon and Caslon Old Face.)\r\nYou could also change x-height and cap height
    relative to ascenders."

    is going to be a \u2018venetian\u2019 or a \u2018garalde\u2019 or whatever\u2026\r\n\r\nThere
    IS a market for a good oldstyle serif."

  body: "It's because I made the bowls rounder than I planned first, for better legibility
    at small sizes. Having that, I started to \"pay to\" these forms, changing existing
    features to fill the gaps.\r\nI posted the thread, because when I saw a test printout
    on my desk, I first thought it was a page from one of articles on typography that
    probably had fallen down from the shelf ;)\r\n\r\nI have prapared an image, but
    there is a problem with uploading today..."

  body: I don't see a problem here, as they are quite different in the details. I
    think you could make it even sharper in the details. I like it. There are a lot
    of oldstyle serifs around, but I think a more modern sharp interpretation does
    fill a gap, as far as I know. Lots of typefaces look simular when set in small
    sizes, but are quite different when looking at the details. I think the image
    above does not give a correct picture of how it will look in hires print, as the
    details (and thus the differences) will be much more visible.
