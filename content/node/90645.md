  the other day (I think it was on Veer but to be honest, haven't a clue). It's quite
  similar to Chaparral Pro, however the differences are most noticeable in the serifs
  and slight variation in the angle of the italic's slant. I've attached a photograph
  of the typeface in question with the most notable differences highlighted and a
  copy of the same text in Chaparral Bold Italic Display for the sake of comparison.\r\n\r\nAny
  assistance you might be able to provide would be most beneficial. At this point,
  I've gone nuts trying to figure it out and haven't had much luck at all. Damn me
  for having cleared the browser history the morning after."
