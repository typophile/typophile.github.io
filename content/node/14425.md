  would be really great to hang on the walls. Either all the letters, a pangram, or
  some mixture of the two laid out attractively. Has this already been done? Where
  can I buy one? Or maybe I can get one of my artists to draw one up for me. I've
  never commissioned art before, it would be pretty cool!\r\n\r\nI think I'd like
  to get a print of Palatino and maybe get Zapf to sign it. Do you think he would
  be up for that? Or Futura and get Wes Anderson, who uses it a lot in his films,
  to sign it."

  body: Me too. Unless you have to have them in 3-d you could probably get a giant
    print made. But you might want to pre-raster it because many large scale printers
    don't come with PS installed - so you might want to prerender something... I haven't
    investigated this as much as I would like. Anybody know about this?

  body: "Hmmm... yeah, good luck with that. But seriously...\r\n\r\nI have been collecting
    typographic posters for years. I can tell you signed specimens are rare. Although,
    if you see [[Hermann Zapf|Zapf]] in a public setting he will probably sign something
    for you, as long as it is an acceptable reproduction of his work. For that matter,
    I think most type designers would do the same.\r\n\r\nSomething else to think
    about, many a typographic ephemera are only to be found at the [[conferences|typographic
    conferences]], where may [[designers|type designers]] can be spotted. sometimes
    type [[foundries]] sell posters that they have designed as specimens. I have acquired
    [[House Industries|House]] and [[Hoefler]] posters this way. \r\n\r\nAlso, you
    can look for original/historic poster art... can be a bit pricey but a great way
    to decorate."

    But as I recall, you can get super high res art prints of any page spread from
    <a href=http://www.octavo.com/store/prints.php>Octavo<a/>."

    and ask the foundry to print it out large and sign it.\r\n\r\nSeveral pages from
    Kent Lew's \"Whitman\" specimen, for instance, would make a super poster.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Poster art is indeed a very cheap way to decorate. I already have three Chinese
    propaganda posters: http://flickr.com/photos/kentwang/tags/propaganda/\r\n\r\nI'll
    have to do some research. Maybe call the printers and think about commissioning
    some good specimen layouts. If I get some commissioned, would any of you guys
    be interested in ordering a few prints? How much would you pay? I'm thinking $25
    or so for an A4 size print. What typefaces would you want done? I personally want
    Palatino and Futura. They're not so obscure and easy to explain to my guests who
    are not all type designers.\r\n\r\nI think this is a little too simple, but it
    can be considered a start: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Palatino.png"

    body: BTW, I'm not intent on making a huge profit off of this. I hope to just
      recoup my commissioning costs, which shouldn't be too expensive anyway. A lot
      of the cost is the actual production of the prints.

  body: I have to admit I would want something different. And I would want it way
    bigger than A4!
