  letterforms are a bit wonky on this image because it's an auto-trace of a screen

  body: "If I had to guesstimate, I'd say this is 70's/80's phototype. Edges seem
    a little too smooth/rounded, which can occur when exposure and focus are a little
    out. Or if you've made multiple copies and the repeated photographic process has
    smoothed out the once sharp corners.\r\n\r\nLooks similar to a SignLab font called
    Spaceage. Only available in .VEF format, so not really usable outside SignLab.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spaceage_vef_3915.png]\r\n\r\nThere
    is a remake called Gayatri Pro which is available in regular TTF & OTF formats.
    It also seems to share quite a lot with Gamer/Chisel, only more rounded.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    there are a lot of unidentified phototypes that were used in films, tv, print
    ads, etc... from the 60's through to the 90's. The entire trade of creating typographic
    elements with phototype was wiped out with the digital revolution and a lot of
    the original film strips containing the typefaces were either phased out and trashed
    or forgotten about and thrown into storage. Thankfully people like Dan X Solo
    and a few others published catalogs containing samples of these faces so that
    they would not be completely lost forever.\r\n\r\nIt took me years of research
    to find out that the original Nintendo Entertainment System and Nikon Coolscan
    film scanners used a typeface known as Limited View, simply because it was an
    obscure phototype that was only digitized as an OPTIFont by Castcraft who no longer
    exist today.\r\n\r\nHopefully some of the alternatives I've listed help.\r\n\r\n"

    \"standard\" font used on much of the standing sets of the 2003-2009 version of
    <b>Battlestar Galactica</b></a>.\r\n\r\nAs for Gayatri Pro, I haven't been able
    to find that. Although there's a \"Gayatri Regular\" that seems to be available
    at some of the free-font sites. "
