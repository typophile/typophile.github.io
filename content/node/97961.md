body: "Hello eyeryone!\r\nThis time my client is an industrial designer who has come
  up with a cross between a portaledge (in case you have no idea what that is, check
  this out: ) and a treehouse. A portable treehouse. \r\n\r\nThe chosen name for this
  miracle of workmanship is \"Cambai\", which is an alternate spelling of \"Kambai\"
  a tree-living tribe from Indonesia that build their dwellings at a height of vertigo-inducing
  30 - 40 feet of the ground and, you probably guessed it, the sound of \"come by\".\r\n\r\nThe
  product is built with rather soft curves, I chose to reflect that in the logo as
  well. A maple seed is hinted at in the shape of the \"b\", which is a symbol the
  designer chose herself. She felt it reflected best the closeness to trees and the
  idea of being able to move to another location at any given time.\r\n\r\nI have
  had some fun with the letters, but unfortunately I have reached an impass. It is
  not yet finished, but I can't for the life of me think, what else to change. Your
  input is therefore very much appreciated!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wow I like it. I'm not a type pro but I think if you make the 'm', 'b' and
    'i' a bit more italic the logotype reads easier and therefore would look better.\r\n\r\nAlso
    would tinker on how the letters are connected especially the a - i at the end
    looks odd to me.\r\n\r\nI like what you have done, it has a lot of personality."

    body: "Cheers, Tim! \r\nThank you for sharing your thoughts.\r\nI have tooled
      the connections extra sharp on this on, hoping to achieve more clarity in smaller
      sizes. I have noticed that if I try to connect everything in handwritten letters
      they way it should be connected - with soft transitions that is - things start
      looking a little swimmy. Like with this one I designed a while back:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SoftDiner_Circles_full_5825.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
      will try to change the axes as you suggested, I'm curious if that will improve
      that logos flow."

    that would work, but it had better be a foolproof design or they'll spend all
    their time in court being sued by families who had a child fall. \r\n\r\nMy brother
    fell out of a treehouse when he was a child. Needed 6 stitches on his head; he
    was lucky he wasn't killed."

  body: I love the way it looks, but frankly I'm having trouble with the <strong>m</strong>.
    My eye keeps reading <strong>canibai</strong>, <strong>caiubai</strong>, or <strong>cawbai</strong>.
    If this were a familiar word such as <em>camera</em>, I think readers would decode
    the letter easily from context, but because this is an unfamiliar word, readers
    must decode it letter by letter, and the <strong>m</strong> may trip them up.

    body: "Hi Victor!\r\nThank you for your input. I believe that readability problem
      might be fixed by attaching the foot connectors of the \"m\" a whole lot higher,
      will try it out in a bit. My concern is, that it might adversely effect readability
      in smaller sizes. But hey, let's give it a shot. ^^"

  body: "He healed up just fine.  Thanks for asking.  But his accident is scary to
    me in retrospect because during my life I've had 2 friends who broke their necks
    due to falls and both ended up paralyzed. So I'm very wary of falls. Even a relatively
    small fall can break a neck if you land wrong. \r\n\r\nThanks for the link; your
    treehouse looks very cool, almost like a space ship. I'm sure kids will like it.
    \r\n\r\nHard to evaluate safety without examining it in person. I'm glad there
    is netting over the windows. My main concern might be how well the fabric holds
    up. The description says \"weather resistant\", but all fabric deteriorates over
    time when outside. Even heavy-duty commercial awnings can eventually rip.\r\n\r\nBut
    anyway it looks like a nice project; good luck with it."

  body: "What a cool idea.\r\n\r\nThe \"m\" seems upside-down, and it should connect
    to the \"b\".\r\n\r\nTechnically, many of the b\xE9ziers aren't so good.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Now this may not look it, but redrawing that m so it connected at the top
      really turned out to be quite a challenge. Here's what I have so far: \r\n\r\nI
      connected the b to the rest of the logotype, which I had not done initially
      as its shape was supposed to stand out. The maple seed thing. I changed my mind
      about that, so now it is connected.\r\n\r\nThe m is \"turned around\" as always,
      I am not entirely sure about the incline. Is there any kind of rule or a guide
      for finding the axes of something as non-geometrical as this lettering? If so,
      I would certainly love to read it, this is always giving me a hard time.\r\n\r\nAlso,
      Hrant, you mentioned some of the beziers not being so good. Could you elaborate
      on that a little? I would like to do as good job as I can and if you have any
      pointers to share I would be keen to hear them!\r\n\r\nI have attached the latest
      version complete with nodes and outlines. \r\nThanks for your feedback!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cambai_nodes_04_5869.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cambai_outlines_04_5640.png]"

  body: The comments above echo my first reactions too. I wonder if you could do something
    a bit more with the top terminal of the /c/ to make it less like the /a/?
