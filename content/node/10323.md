  Em Square, for me to be able to draw a 18 pixel tall grid in the Guides layer, that&#39;ll
  let draw pixels into it and then generate 18 pixel bitmaps that are identical? &#40;13

  body: i dont really want to draw it as a &#39;true&#39; bitmap font, i just want
    it to be pixelated and it to be &#39;faithful&#39; to its pixels at a certain
    point size.  <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://atomicmedia.net/am/make.htmlx" TARGET="_top">http://atomicmedia.net/am/make.htmlx</A>
    is kind of what I&#39;m trying to do, except I&#39;m trying to use a taller more
    detailed font.  <BR> <BR>The font has descending parts that reach down to 4 pixels
    below the baseline, and 13 pixels above it. I might scale the 13 pixel top down
    to a 12 pixel top, though. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m lost with fontographer settings..
    It&#39;s been a year or two since I&#39;ve used it seriously. I feel pretty sad
    for having to ask..

  body: in step 6 at my site, just change the ascent and descent settings to your
    liking, i.e. ascent=12, descent=4. do everything else the same and it should work
    out. <BR> <BR>oh, and change the bitmap size to 16 point in step 9...

    do the pixels look bigger or smaller than the outline? <BR> <BR>here is what it

    you a 12 or 14 pixel bitmap, go with that... '
