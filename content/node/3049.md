  body: Im not fond of it myself. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> Sorry. <BR>It seems to fall right smack dab in place with
    the million other &#39;non decipherable&#39; faces that <BR>get distributed for
    free on the &#39;1000 true type font&#39; CDs. <BR> <BR>Try to simplyfy it some
    -- well -- quite a lot. <BR>It really lacks continuity. <BR> <BR>On a positive
    note, I just saved a whole bunch of money on my car insurance. <BR> <BR>&#40;sorry
    could not resist&#41; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>best of luck. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.
