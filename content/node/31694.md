body: "Possibly the longest thread name in the World, ever.\r\n\r\nOK, so I've been
  lazy with the new redraw of my typeface 'Magnitude'. I started the redraw by creating
  each character as a single outline in Illustrator, with the intention of outlining
  the paths, resizing and tweaking later, once a base character set had been drawn.\r\n\r\n'Magnitude'
  Typophile critique thread here: http://typophile.com/node/31634\r\n\r\nI started
  the outlining and resizing and noticed a flaw with my technique. When I resize each
  different weight the x-/cap/ascender/descender height changes, depending on whether
  I resize according to x- or cap height. The PDF attached kind of illustrates the
  point.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to know was...\r\n\r\n1. Is there a preferred method
  for resizing a typeface designed in this way, or is it just not recommended to do
  it with this technique?\r\n\r\n2. Is it better to design a regular weight and then
  completely draw from scratch a light and bold weight (or start with a light then
  do regular and bold)? Are there any standard techniques for up and downscaling type
  weights?\r\n\r\n3. I've noticed some typefaces where each different weight has different
  x-height and overshoot. Do you think these should be the same throughout a font
  family or should they vary between weight?\r\n\r\n4. Even in a monoline typeface,
  it it advisable to have at least a small difference in thickness between horizontal
  and vertical stems? I've had conflicting viewpoints on this one so far. If it's
  advisable, home much less (as a percentage) should the horizontals be to be optically
  the same width as the verticals?"

    wasn't happy with Illustrators' handling of points and handles when converting

  body: "1. I would recommend drawing in FontLab.\r\n\r\n2. For a sans serif, a good
    method is to draw the extra bold and ultra thin, and interpolate the rest. The
    ultra thin is relatively easy, as it can be handled as a stroked path (\"Make
    Parallel Path\" in Fontlab).\r\n\r\n3. It depends on how the type may be used.
    If printed body copy of contrasting weights is anticipated, then the bold should
    have a larger x-height, so that, for instance, bold subheads don't look smaller
    than the following regular text. However, if display combo (eg in the same word)
    are anticipated, then x-height should be the same. When it comes to low-res screen
    display, it is better to standardize x-height hinting/alignment zones/overshoots.\r\n\r\n4.
    Verticals should be thicker than horizontals (except in ultra thin, see above),
    otherwise your maximum weight is constrained to be no more than the thickness
    of E's horizontal stems in your boldest weight. \r\n\r\nYou should start right
    now on the ultra-bold of this typeface. There are so many \"techno\" faces that
    have a limited weight range; they lack personality and usability. In fact, all
    types show more personality in the extreme variants -- consider Frutiger and Myriad
    for instance -- Myriad is more distinctive in its bolder and condensed styles."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, Nick :)\r\n\r\nI've always considered Fontlab's
    drawing tools vastly inferior to Illustrator's... is there any obvious reason
    why it's better to use FontLab over Illustrator? What's the difference between
    the Fontlab interpolation method nd the blend tool (+ tweaks) in Illustrator?\r\n\r\nI
    intend the family to be used for display purposes only, each weight with alternates,
    small caps/unicase and stencil version. I'm considering extending it to five weights
    (and trying to shake off the 'techno' tag too)."
