  they like and I can't seem to turn up any information about it. Do any of you know
  where I can find out more about Oracle and possibly buy a copy?\r\n\r\nThank you

  body: "Optima certainly makes sense based on the styles they have mentioned (simple,
    neat, etc). \r\n\r\nDoes it seem weird that they would know it by Oracle instead
    of Optima?\r\n\r\nThanks for the insight, Elzadra. \r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "I suspect that's what some of us call 'aliases' -- re-named versions of well-known
    fonts -- that are often a way to avoid infringing on name copyrights. Sometimes,
    but not always, a way to disguise unauthorized copies of fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I see. So in a typographic context a \"by-name\" would usually be a new name
    given to a copy of a font in an attempt to avoid copyright infringment. \r\n\r\nJust
    out of curriosity -- seeing as how I am a little new to the type business -- is
    giving a copied font a by-name usually a succesful way to avoid legal trouble?
    Isn't that like stealing someone's dog, calling it by a new name and demanding
    that it was your dog all along?\r\n\r\nThanks for the links to font aliases, David.
    Those will definitely come in handy. \r\n\r\nDuncan"
