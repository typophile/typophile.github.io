<p>Doing an entire family would take too long to be practical. Easier to focus on a few letter-strings. To avoid practice effects and untoward effects of order, the order of glyphs and with method of letter spacing would have to be carefully counterbalanced.</p>
<p>Getting other expert type designers to do the same letter spacing task would produce more materials.</p>
<p>Following this a &ldquo;can you see the difference?&rdquo; test of sorts would be very telling. I would run this portion on normals, not typographers, and do my best to keep them uninformed. Other measures such as preference or visual search could be established depending on your goal.</p>
<p>I would make all judgments on paper due to fidelity.</p>
<p>Designing a complete experiment would take some time, but a fun one to think about for sure.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The problem with the &ldquo;ruler&rdquo; is you have to know what you are measuring for. Almost every single letter in fonts regarded as excellent have what are sometimes called &ldquo;optical corrections&rdquo;&ndash;meaning that in order to look &ldquo;right&rdquo; or good geometric simplicity and uniformity has to be departed from. As Nick says, sometimes what you need is uniformity, and then using a ruler helps. For example overshoots and stems are usually pretty uniform. However, even there, there are exceptions where uniformity is not desirable.</div>

<p>Russell — W.A. Dwiggins and C.H. Griffith had some correspondence debating this topic 70 years ago. Dwiggins always felt that there must be some kind of mathematical formula that would allow the quick arrival at optimal spacing for a given weight of design and was frustrated at the iterative process. Griffith maintained that the eye must be the final arbiter. I spoke on this topic at the 2003 ATypI conference.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My source was copies of the correspondence which is held in the C.H Griffith Papers collection in the Margaret I. King library at the University of Kentucky, Lexington.</p>
<p>Fitting ultimately was done by the Linotype drawing office, under the watch and guidance of Griffith. Dwiggins would frequently indicate on his “thin paper” drawings some starting values for sidebearings, as he saw it. But these might or might not be the final values at the end of the fitting process. Final decisions were made from printed proofs: it either looked good or it did not. (And if it did not, then the degree of dissatisfaction would sometimes have to be weighed against the costs and efforts of recutting.)</p>
<p>The Linotype machine did not admit of any kerning, so there were never attempts to “kern by math.”</p>

A good eye requires training, to develop taste; and exercise, to maintain the faculty.
It is debilitating to rely overly on mechanical aids.</p>
<p>However, the human body is not built for routine (that would be an adaptive disaster, an inability to cope with the unexpected).
So taste should not be allowed to ossify.
At the simplest physiological level, this becomes apparent after one has been working for several hours on an italic, whereupon an inspection of roman letter forms reveals that they have mysteriously acquired a backward slant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I check the glyphs I&rsquo;m drawing by flipping them, and FontLab obliges with a little button in the Metrics panel which performs this task.</p>

This is both a program—and hence a mathematically based algorithm—and a service, as there are variables that are adjusted for the specific typeface, to suit the designer. Other automatic spacing programs include the original HZ program, and its development into the &ldquo;optical&rdquo; spacing program of Adobe. Designers generally think none of the automatic kerning programs capture what the eye can do, though they get close.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think IKern is so public, so it hasn&rsquo;t been widely evaluated. Jos&rsquo;s endorsement is impressive, though.</p>

And [[http://typophile.com/node/4588|here]] Thomas Phinney says the Adobe optical kerning is based on URW&rsquo;s work—which Adobe bought. I assume he&rsquo;s referring to stuff that was included in the Hz program, though it&rsquo;s not totally clear.</div>

<p>What’s worse is that not only do that leave that pernicious code in their software, but that at the events Adobe puts on to promote Creative Suite they tell designers that optical kerning is superior to built-in font kerning and to use it for everything. Everyone who teaches typography or graphic design should make sure to tell students to never use optical kerning.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I can&rsquo;t remember which magazine it was, but there was an article about House Industries' Studio Script collection that was illustrated with specimens of the fonts. Some of these were connecting scripts and I was shocked at how inconsistent and badly aligned the letter-to-letter connections were. It was clear to me that the samples were set in InDesign with &ldquo;optical&rdquo; spacing enabled. If a professional graphic design magazine (in an article about type, no less) can make such a blunder, I think we would be better off without it. At least they could move it to a submenu of a submenu of a tiny pop-up menu in the corner of a tool bar or something. It seems to have done the trick for advanced OpenType features.</div>
