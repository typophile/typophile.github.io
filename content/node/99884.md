  inspiration to design a beautiful classy sexy website for an escorte agency. \r\n\r\nSince
  I don't get a lot of inspiration looking at other sites, because frankly all sites
  like that seem to suck (haha  ) on purpose. \r\n\r\nSince I'm a girl, I'm not that
  familiar with good designed sites like that. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have some tips
  for me ? \r\n\r\nThanks !!"

    is Objects of Desire. Consequently, look for inspiration from masters of the art,
    like Cartier\u2026"

    be to hire a good web design firm who's portfolio has examples of beautiful, classy
    sites they've designed.\r\n\r\nBut if you want do-it-youself advice, I'd look
    for inspiration at websites that maybe have nothing to do with escort services
    but have the classy look you're looking for. Look for companies that have expensive
    or exclusive services and see what their sites look like.\r\n\r\n"

    police :p \r\n\r\nI was also thinking about more luxurious products, but still
    in the line of ... like agent provocateur ... \r\n\r\nAnd yes I said \"since I'm
    a girl\" .... I was assuming men watch more porn than girls ;)\r\nNot to sound
    sexistic or anything (haha)\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to the topic ... It would be nice
    if you knew some sites from the top of your head or some fonts that would go well
    ... \r\nBecause I'm still in the brainstorming process ... whether to go for dark
    reds and pink or black and gold etc... \r\nI was also thinking of looking at sites
    of clubs ... if you have any good clubsites you know, i would like to hear it
    from you :) \r\n\r\nThanks for the comments ;)\r\nMay you be inspired for some
    \"sexy time\" !"

    favor of something else\u2014similar, but not Trajan, missing the extreme oldstyle
    proportions.\r\n\r\nI agree with the general idea of getting inspiration from
    classy sites that have less extreme erotic content, if you don't find any good
    inspiration from other escort sites."

  body: Elegant feminine script-typefaces. Another nice, classy but still sexy website
    is for example Coco de Mer. As said before me, there are great references to elegant
    sexuality in fine art.
