  through the alphabet and numbers. Now I'm stumped by the punctuation. \r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any guide, tips or resources on designing these? I would especially
  like to know if there is any kind of logic, or best practices for the sizing, placement,
  spacing and so on of punctuation. A testing text would be nice too especially for
  the punctuation in use (English is my only language!),\r\n\r\nthanks,"

    character design standards</a> are probably a good starting point. But your best
    bet is to check what other quality typefaces do, and then decide for yourself.
