body: Ok, so I just realized all the "non-editable" PDFs I've been exporting from
  Illustrator (custom type work) are in fact EDITABLE? Even after unchecking the "Preserve
  Illustrator Editing Capabilities" option & "Create Acrobat Layers from Top-Level
  Layers" just in case. Am I missing something here? I tried looking it up, but people
  seemed confused or believe that the tick box actually does something. What's the
  deal?

    by it are most compatible with itself.\r\n\r\nThe \"Editing Caps\" checkbox might
    add private info to some objects, such as the 'language' attribute of text, which
    isn't carried over in a regular PDF."

  body: "Unintuitive? Surely not?\r\n\r\nI just tried -- typed \"Hi!\", applied \"French:Canadian\"
    (picked at random). Exported to Illy without \"Editing Caps\" selected. It opens
    the PDF without complaining, but the language was reset to the default. Exporting
    <em>with</em> \"Editing Caps\" got the original text & language back.\r\n\r\nAs
    I said, Illustrator can open almost any PDF and edit it. Unchecking \"Preserve
    Editing Capabilities\" does <em>not</em> prevent Illy from being able to open
    it.\r\n\r\nI've never seen layers in a PDF and wouldn't know where to look for
    them, but I imagine it works in a similar way -- \"flattening\" the PDF without,
    preserving layers with the option checked."

    although that may not be appropriate depending on your situation.

    In Acrobat you can disallow any of those listed actions. I think you can also
    restrict printing to low-res. And you can set a password to get into the dialog
    that changes the security settings (so that people can't just un-set them). For
    your purposes you'd want to disallow \"Content Copying or Exctraction\" and possibly
    \"Changing the Document\".\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/acrosets_5421.JPG]"

    on PC, don't have access to a Mac): distilled a Word file using Acrobat 7 Pro,
    and set security settings of printing ALLOWED but all changing of the document
    DISALLOWED. Then opened the resultant PDF in Acrobat and tried to print it to
    PDF995: wouldn't do it; threw an error.\r\nOpen the PDF in some other 3rd party
    application and try to print to either PDF995 or Acrobat Distiller: in eaither
    case it now prints successfully, and the new PDF claims to have no security, but
    I seem to be unable to select and edit text. Quite random."
