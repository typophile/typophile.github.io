  the company name is A&I <- that is a capital \"i\". Its an industrial company. I
  was in the Lubalin or Rockwell range but it still not right and not really interesting
  enough for a logotype. \r\n\r\nI am NOT a font geek so don't be too harsh on the
  lubalin :)\r\n\r\nthe letters must be in CAPS so I can really only use serif typefaces
  otherwise the i looks like an l."

  body: "Consider using two different fonts for the <strong>A</strong> and the <strong>I</strong>.
    You could use an <strong>I</strong> with prominent serifs (e.g., Clarendon or
    Bodoni) and a contrasting font (a sans serif?) for the <strong>A</strong>. Or
    maybe you could use an <strong>A</strong> with vertical rather than slanted sides,
    to mirror the <strong>I</strong>?\r\nAlso, is the ampersand going to be part of
    the logo? If so, it will be the busiest of the three characters, so choose an
    ampersand that doesn't upstage the <strong>A</strong> and the <strong>I</strong>.
    Or see if you can use a plus sign. "
