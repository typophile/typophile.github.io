I mean a 1st or 2:1 or do you think too many people think too much about it, as they never get asked what classification they get in employment. Do they? At the 4 designers conference in London, they mentioned the fact that no one asks about it. Is this a good attitude to give out to students or erm&hellip;bad? WOuld just liek your views on it. Thanks.
PS isn&rsquo;t it the attitude, the personality, the way one thinks and the passion for design that REALLY matters or all of the above and more so? Please enlighten me.</p>
<p>PPS Would you rather be daring when it comes to design and fail or would you be safe and get a good grade?</p>

<p>For most people just going to design school—as opposed to, say, business school—is pretty risky and takes a lot of courage to begin with. And your professors are probably pushing you to risk more than you realize.</p>
<p><cite>What about other characteristics needed to be a great designer that aren’t throughly applauded upon at university.</cite></p>
<p>Life goes on after university. In a field like design university is just the beginning of one’s education.</p>
<p><cite>Students are not able to take risks due to the fear of failing.</cite></p>
<p>And that experience prepares them for the real world, where taking the wrong risks can bankrupt a designer and possibly a client.</p>
<p><cite>What would you say to degree students?</cite></p>
<p>Don’t worry so much. You’ll be done soon enough.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In my opinion, everyone should get to university and if it&rsquo;s a good one, better. Now&hellip; there&rsquo;s good and bad university&rsquo;s , some School&rsquo;s as James said can pass you a wrong idea of whats the industry or how it works leading many people to abandon design later on. And there&rsquo;s the good ones that will make you grow both professionally and as a person. On top of all that&hellip;there&rsquo;s the school as an Business so of course it&rsquo;s of they&rsquo;re best interest to appear on the charts.</p>
<p>Basically for me where you studied or your grades are important at a first/superficial look/evaluation only to know something about you and your path. But what really matters for me is the works you did, your personality, your will and how you work.</p>
<p>So if you wanna do something risky and different, do it at school, and learn from it, explore yourself. See the other&rsquo;s reaction and take advantage that there&rsquo;s no client or money involved :) Just evolve as a person and learn something more then just designing, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s University is for.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is easy to say look at this one, he/she made a difference or was important etc; and he/she didn&rsquo;t get a degree and so on. There is no shortage of examples of amazing self starting folk. But they are exceptional.</p>
<p>If you are going to decide that university or other training doesn&rsquo;t matter you had better be ready to throw 110%+ at getting where you want to go on your own.  That is a rare sort of person and you had better be honest with yourself about if that&rsquo;s the kind you are.</p>
<p>The converse is also true. Good grades at school don&rsquo;t always translate into success afterwards - but they don&rsquo;t hurt one bit. Not because the work itself is necessarily a key to or identical to what real jobs are like, but because learning how to hit the task hard and keep pushing until you get the result you want is not something everybody knows how to do. Getting good grades shows know how. That you have the will to get things done and are probably not going to be a prima dona about it.</p>
<p><cite> PS isn’t it the attitude, the personality, the way one thinks and the passion for design that REALLY matters or all of the above and more so? </cite></p>
<p>No. They matter but they are far far far from being enough. If that were so then everybody who was a laugh at a party would be hugely successful. They are not. It takes hard work.</p>

Faz, if you want stats on this kind of issue in the UK, check out Icograda and its surveys. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t take your nose off the grindstone&ndash;compromising your principals in order to get good marks is unlikely to have lasting effects on your design mojo.</p>
<p><em>Would you rather be daring when it comes to design and fail or would you be safe and get a good grade?</em></p>
<p>That sounds like a design brief, where one is required to resolve conflicting criteria. So, why not design a way to be daring and get a good grade?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I taught at design schools, as my students became overly concerned with grades, I would tell them that, &ldquo;no one is going to ask you what grade you got in Typography 3 all they care about is your ability to demonstrate to them that you can do the work.&rdquo; I also told my students that I had never gone to design school, and was pretty much self taught, with the occasional night school class at SVA.</p>
<p>I know there are firms in NYC that only consider graduates from certain programs (or at least heavily favor them). But I wonder if the era of the self-taught designer is still with us, or is it over?</p>
<p>I stopped teaching at design schools, because I came to realize that I could no longer be apart of a factory system that takes in students, charges them extraordinary tuition, and essentially gives them vocational training, rather than an education. A small fraction of these students will go on and get work, the rest will do something else, but they will be ill prepared to do that something else since they have received a sub-standard education. Some of those ill-prepared students, who couldn&rsquo;t land a design job will go on to graduate school, rather than give up on their dream of a design career.</p>
<p>At approximately $40,000 a year for a top design school, how can you justify $160,000 to $250,000 in loans for a career that will start you out in the high $20K low $30K and will take years to advance to a modest 6 figure income?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any real answers to my complaint. I have said before that design is the new acting, and every year students invest heavily to enter schools for both fields. The acting students go in with their eyes open, being told from the very beginning how difficult it is to make a living as an actor. New design students have not been given the same good advice.</p>

<p>James - the same is now true of the fine arts - it has become necessary to have an MFA and now the curators are going straight to arts grad programs to mine for artists. Be interesting to see where  some of these students are in 5 or 10 years. Myself, I&rsquo;m trying the &ldquo;labor in obscurity until my vision has matured and then spring full-blown onto the scene in later life&rdquo; approach.</p>

That another university marks differently doesn&rsquo;t matter. That individual instructors mark differently doesn&rsquo;t matter. That a fellow student gets a higher mark than you on a project doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is what <em>you</em> are learning, and whether you are developing your design mojo. You will get a job–or you will fail to get that job–based upon your design mojo.</div>

People who see your good grades should be able to pre-suppose a portfolio full of good work.</cite></p>
<p>I think the former may be true, but not the latter. I have seen plenty of really mediocre portfolios from &ldquo;A&rdquo; students. When I taught it was very difficult to get an &ldquo;A&rdquo; in my class. I had the reputation of being a very tough grader. But I didn&rsquo;t see it that way. I threw &ldquo;B&quot;s and &ldquo;C&quot;s around, and if you just showed up you&rsquo;d pass the course (with a C- or D) but you&rsquo;d pass.</p>
<p>I think all design schools should be Pass/Fail, with the portfolio review the sole arbiter of class rank, if class rank is important to anyone. Better yet, you could withhold grades for the seniors altogether until you saw who got hired and by whom. Then you could dole them out and point to the fact that all your grade A students landed really impressive jobs. Great for recruitment if no one looked to close! Hah!</p>

<p>F: You didn&rsquo;t do the assignment
D: You tossed it together the night before
C: You did the assignment as instructed
B: You <em>really</em> did the assignment, good job.
A: You went above and beyond all expectations and produced something above the expected level.</p>
<p>At my university, you could still eek out a good grade in a failed* project (I&rsquo;m thinking about my senior new media project&hellip;) if you documented the creative process and then turned that documentation into a project in and of itself since part of the idea is to learn through your projects.  If you showed you had learned and how you might have done things differently to have gotten a  successful project, you might not get top marks but still good ones.</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re planning on working in the public sector (not the best place for design jobs, though they exist, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one who isn&rsquo;t a designer by day on here), the degree is absolutely necessary.  And while grades might not matter hugely, though I have been asked for transcripts (again, not a design job), if you plan on working in another country and need to convalidate your degree which you must do for all public and some private jobs, course selection can be more important than grades.</p>
<p><em>«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos». (La Luz Oscura, por Javier Guerrero)</em></p>
<p>*failed here meaning one realized it was impossible to complete the objects one had set out for oneself at the beginning, as opposite to turning in crap work or non-existent work.

<p>I agree that the ability to survive requires a tough skin, and the sooner one develops that tough skin the better. But crits in school are much different than the crits one receives as a professional. In school the crit is always framed as a learning experience. Constructive criticism is what I think they call it. Most client critiques lack this compassionate edge.</p>

<p>Oh I had plenty of non-compassionate art teachers. Students reduced to tears in crits. However, that is good preparation for the working world.</p>
<p><cite>the truth of the matter is that most schools teach fantasy-land work so if there is a problem at all it is schools not putting the students under real-world production problem solving.</cite></p>
<p>This statement is the source of my bias against design school. Plus I found design school grads often had a sense of entitlement - walk right in and expect to be handed plum design work rather than do whatever you&rsquo;re handed, keep your eyes open, have a good attitude and earn the right to do the good projects.</p>

<p>But tough nasty cookies don&rsquo;t get return work. The trick is, the client gets to be nasty but the designer has to remain calm and positive. This is the thick skin part and why good people skills are important for success. Designers provide a service to a client. Clients can choose to use you for that service or hire someone else. Very few very sought after designers have the luxury of choosing clients. Those lucky few did not find themselves in that position by being nasty to clients. Designers have to learn how to be skillful communicators and collaborators. Would you hire someone who was nasty to you? There is a big difference between a designer who has done their homework and speaks effectively and can get their point across without negative behavior and an egocentric bully who is so demanding that nobody will work with them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was a student that had to be reduced to tears before I really grasped what it was I was attempting to do. Yeah, I think the teacher was a little over the top, but his kind of teaching put me on the right track. When I became a teacher I consciously avoided doing what he did, but never forgot the lesson he taught me. In school the teacher was the client, so I always worked to please the teacher. I was lucky. I had teachers that I could trust in that I knew if they approved of my work it meant it was good. In life I work to please the client. Underlying all of this &ldquo;pleasing of others&rdquo; is me making sure I think I&rsquo;m still doing good work.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t about becoming tough. It is about understanding. Understanding the clients needs in terms of how you can solve them with what you have to offer.</p>

<p>And about recognizing that if your client is not ultimately satisfied with the work, then your design was not successful, regardless of whether or not you agree with him. It can be extremely frustrating when a client asks you to do something you don&rsquo;t want to (I&rsquo;m dealing with this right now on a book cover) but you need to pick your battles and if you alienate the client you lose the client. Some are worth losing, but in this economy&hellip; that&rsquo;s not a luxury I want to take. It can also be hard to avoid &ldquo;design fatigue&rdquo; which is that point in the design process where you are willing to do almost whatever they ask in order to get the job DONE and your invoice paid. It happens, and the more experience you have (and the more extensive portfolio) the easier it is to accept that some jobs are just not going to end up in your portfolio.</p>

<p>Rubbish. A design can be quite successful and never satisfy the client, because clients  may simply be stupid and desire random changes that undermine the requirements they set forth in the first place. Sometimes the designer has failed to communicate why the design works in a way the client can understand, but sometimes the client is just plain stupid.</p>
<p>I once worked for a client who requested an advertisement on a very short timeline, designed to fit into an existing campaign. Several successful ads were produced, the client chose one…and requested a minor aesthetic change. The change was made, and then the client requested another, and another and so on. Fourteen color shifts, shadow angles, weight changes, etc. later the window of opportunity was past and the ad died. Every version was a successful design, but the client could not be satisfied because the client was stupid and refused to be satisfied.</p>

<p>If the client went to a different designer for his next project, or didn&rsquo;t pay for all the time spent on revisions, the design was not successful. This is a business. We provide a service for money. Ideally, we also like what we do.</p>

<p>To say a design was not successful is not the same thing as saying it was not good. Clients reject excellent designs all the time often for very misguided reasons. But as Ken points out we are in the business of servicing said clients and if the client doesn&rsquo;t get what they want we have not done our job. Sometimes the best thing to do is agree on a kill fee and walk away.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There are many kinds of success. Louis Kahn is one. But think of the standard american paperclip. That is one seriously successful design! If by success you mean ubiquity and such deep penetration into the culture that the design itself ceases to even invite question - almost like air. Agreeing to a kill fee and walking can be a huge success too. I am of course not advocating for any of the above per se. Just saying that inevitably you place your own goal posts and in so doing keep your own score.</div>
