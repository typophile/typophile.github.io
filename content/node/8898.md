  body: So, if this is the Answer, what is the Question? &#40;In other words, what&#39;s
    your intention for the typeface?&#41; It can be helpful to start your design with
    a brief, like &#34;This should be a text face in the style of Garamond, condensed
    approximately 5%, available for use with Monotype, Linotype, and hand setting.&#34;
    &#40;That&#39;s a paraphrase of the brief for Sabon.&#41; <BR> <BR>If you want
    to use this for ad work/short text/headings, it has promise, and with a bit of
    polish, it would find a niche.  <BR> <BR>If you want to use this for book work/long
    text, there&#39;s much more work ahead. In addition to the items Juan Pablo mentioned,
    the cap J also is likely to stand out. Remember that text faces tend to be conservative,
    and characters that &#34;pop out&#34; at the reader are not likely to lead to
    the typeface being used. <BR> <BR>Keep us posted on the progress!

  body: This is fun. I don&#39;t see it as a something that should be set in long
    books, but certainly in poetry or special editions of prose. This would be fun
    as something used in letterpress shops. <BR> <BR>I also like the -g- but I wonder
    if a few of the other glyphs could sway a little further towards the same level
    of quirkiness? The -j- has that too, and the -f- is working towards it. I see
    the -y- and -t- also have some of that stopped short feeling. However, the uppercase
    should probably maintain more solemnity. What other characters can you quirk?

  body: 'i quite like your approach and the ideas you&#39;ve got -- but i think it
    isn&#39;t commited enough. go for &#34;quirkie&#34; or for text, in each case
    you&#39;d have to be more radical. <BR> <BR>some things that came to my eye: <BR>the
    top right extension of the Z looks a bit arbitrary to me. <BR>the X is very top
    heavy. <BR>the connection of bowl and stem of the b could perhaps be a bit lighter.   <BR>
    <BR>and without the intention of being offensive: the @ looks somehow elephantish!'

  body: 'Thank you all for your coments and encouragement. <BR> <BR>&#34;if this is
    the Answer, what is the Question?&#34; hmm...  As this is my first font &#40;but
    not my first attempt&#41; it was a massive learning experience.  The Question
    was something along the lines of &#39;how hard can it be?&#39;.  I&#39;ve lost
    my innocence now.   <BR> <BR>But my intentions for the font was to create something
    I would want to use.  I&#39;m an artist first, and I mostly use printed type to
    describe mine or others art.  Catalogues, postcards that sort of thing.  So short
    texts, information, presented in a smart and contemporary environment. <BR> <BR>&#39;that
    g&#39;: my thinking was sometihng like this - traditional g; elegant but inefficient
    use of space &#40;cramped&#41; - modern&#42; g; inelegant but efficient.  So i
    came up with a sort of hybrid of the two.  I think it works for now, non-type-interested
    people i&#39;ve shown examples to haven&#39;t noticed it until i pointed it out.&#40;&#42;
    i don&#39;t know if &#39;modern&#39; is acurate historically&#41;. <BR> <BR>The
    lowercase j and t. This typeface thinks the hooks traditionally put on these letters
    are calligraphic and inefficient and are therefore to be spurned.  Plus i&#39;ve
    been enjoying Futura.  I know this has readability issues, and if my arm was twisted
    i would make a hooked t. <BR> <BR>As for the quirkiness of it.  Tiffanys coment
    about quirking other letters made me think.  The phrase &#39;stopped short feeling&#39;
    had quite a lot of resonance.  I guess it comes from the influence of sans-serifs
    faces and my inner modernist.  <BR>It seemed that these letters could be quirked:
    <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64106.gif" alt="">
    <BR>&#40;original in grey&#41; <BR> <BR>I dont&#39; think the k works, but i like
    the m, and arn&#39;t sure about the w.  I don&#39;t want to make it into a semi-serif.
    So maybe I should go further back on some letters.  But I want it to be a serious
    typeface. With useful quirks. The lack of a final serif on the new m reduces the
    width of a wide letter. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve adjusted the &#39;sad a&#39; and b as
    suggested by Juan Pablo.  Totally redrawring the bowl of the a and making the
    top of the bowl of the b 2 degrees steeper. I think it is an improvement. <BR>
    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64107.gif" alt=""> <BR>
    <BR>Titus, yes that corner of the Z is a bit arbitary,  it&#39;ll probably go.  about
    the X do you mean the junction is too low on the glyph, or do you think the heavyness
    is to do with the stroke contrast?  i see what you mean about the elephantishness
    of the @ :-&#41; I was wanting to make it as small as possible, the large @ symbols
    allways seem to be out of place written in lowercase email adresses, and often
    too light.  I&#39;ll probably re-work it. <BR> <BR>Again thanks for your critiques
    - keep it coming. <BR> <BR>Ed'

  body: 'by top heavy i mean, that the X looks unbalanced as if it would fall down
    in a second.  <BR>the reason for this is, that the top has to be narrower to look
    optically as wide as the bottom. <BR>i&#39;ll let my a picture speak to give you
