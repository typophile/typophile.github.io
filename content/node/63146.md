body: "Hi Typophilers.\r\nI am looking for suggestions for a small family of type
  that will work as body copy and pull quotes for a tourism organisation. The organisation
  currently uses a cut of ottomat (caps) and Gill sans. Trouble is Gill Sans is looking
  very tired, it has many kerning issues (f v, t V) and issues with the letter l and
  number 1. We want to refresh the collateral, and replacing Gill will play a large
  role in that. \r\n\r\nI am hoping to find a small family that has high legibility,
  has a style that complements an editorial-based design (photo essays, friendly approachable),
  but is not too styled so that it overtakes the design. It should be seen and read,
  adding flavour to the editorial, but not be noticed if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nOh
  and I would prefer a Sans serif as it will link in with online design styles.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nJason."

    on screen, but it appears a bit softer on the page. Great work."
