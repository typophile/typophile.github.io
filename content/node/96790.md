  body: "Well, thank you, Hrant and, of course, screw you, Ryan. I just wonder what
    the hell I\u2019m going to do with the domain name, by Microsoft Registered Vendor
    status, and eleven hundred lame-ass fonts. Maybe this guy would be interested
    in buying the concept\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gobignetwork.com/users/Eric-Inlaw2?utm_source=smartmatch&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=smartmatch\r\n\r\nFor
    that matter, he might also like to invest in a Global Digital Rights Management
    Point-of-Sale plugin that would assign a unique serial number to MP3, fonts and
    other stuff, pay the rights holder instantly, then use the Cloud to track pirates.
    Or not: that\u2019s probably a little too \u201CBig Brother\u201D to suit freebooting
    American tastes. After all, Hrant: YOU think that it\u2019s a pretty good idea,
    and I don\u2019t mind sharing.\r\n\r\nOn a third hand, there\u2019s also this
    screwy idea I have to use cheap plastic parts, flexible tubing, an air compressor
    and a Stirling engine to cut heating and cooling costs for every new residential
    or commercial facility in the entire world by at least 67%, and maybe even more\u2026\r\n\r\nBTW,
    what dipwad came up with the \u201Crent it for five minutes\u201D provision to
    Monotype\u2019s SkyFonts proposal. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to sell EPS comps
    for, say, a buck apiece, with no minimum purchase\u2014other than the FIRST buck,
    that is\u2014required? Who knows? Some people\u2019s monthly font expenditures
    COULD exceed their smartphone bills\u2026especially if there are hot coeds involved.\r\n"

    more, and I oughta be set for awhile\u2026"

    I just had an idea: put your stuff on the next TypeCon auction.\r\n\r\nSmartphone

    I hope that the next convention is close by. The 1912 ATF Book of American Typefaces
