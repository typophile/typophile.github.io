  </code>\r\n<strong>Realist</strong> from [[http://www.martinplusfonts.com|MartinPlusFonts.com]]
  is a straightforward typeface that speaks in a simple voice without being stern.
  It\u2019s ideal for corprate design as well as editorial work, for headlines that
  speak of simplicity or for product design with an exclusive touch. It works for
  all expressions where the message plays the leading role.\r\n<code> </code>\r\nDownload

    and styles.\r\n\r\nYour web site is also very functional and attractive. Good
    luck!"

  body: Really handsome and clear.  It stakes out a nice territory between grotesque
    revivals like Founders Grotesk or FF Bau and more humanist workhorses like Gotham
    and Museo Sans.  And I love those Op Art borders.

  body: "On page 3 of the Realist specimen, is that the wrong /g/ on the 4th line,
    style 1 and style 2? Or is the PDF correct?\r\n\r\nAnd, hey, I just noticed that
    there are four /a/ variations on this page!"

  body: "Hi Tilman, \r\nI'm afraid that my specimen PDF is not faulty :-P\r\nThe idea
    is that the user can combine two Alternate/Style setting to access the variants
    in this typeface. \r\n\r\n<strong>Alternates / Style 1:</strong>\r\nBy choosing
    <em>Stylistic Alternates</em> (in Illustrator for example) or <em>Stylistic Set
    1</em> (in InDesign) you\u2019ll get round punctuation marks and alternates of
    \"I\", \"a\", \"b\", \"g\", \"i\", and \"l\".\r\n\r\n<strong>Style 2:</strong>\r\nOnly
    choosing <em>Stylistic Set 2</em> will give you access to an alternate \"a\" as
    well as \"y\", upright italic designs if you will.\r\n\r\n<strong>Alternates /
    Style 1 + Style 2:</strong>\r\nCombining <em>both styles</em> will give you the
    same alternates as in Style 1 but with (humanist) upright italics for \"a\", \"g\"
    and \"y\"."
