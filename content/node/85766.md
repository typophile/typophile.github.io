  me at least), the second question is of interest to me personally]\r\n\r\nI would
  be glad to get your feedback on a typographic solution I came up with. \r\n\r\nThe
  objective was to find a way to get some decent typography elements into my writing
  with no or limited budget for fonts. The Bitstream font collection that comes with
  Corel Draw is available to me. As educational institutions can be conservative I
  was looking for a very Times-like solution to replace Times New Roman. My critique
  on TNR is simple: too compressed and too much contrast. \r\nTimes Ten / Bitstream
  version Dutch 801 would be a perfect replacement. OSF and SC are substituted by
  TeX Gyre Termes, another TNR clone. I would like to know if this look like a semi
  acceptable solution. \r\n\r\nDutch 801 (body text) & Termes (for OSF and SC): \r\n<img

  New Roman:\r\n<img src=http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/8987/screenshot20110924at135.png>\r\n\r\nPlease
  have a look at the attached PDF with a complete paragraph set in both variations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>A
  second question</strong>:\r\nWhich typeface out of the following would be a good
  choice for headlines to pair with Times in the body text:\r\nBitstream versions
  of: Fairfield, Electra, Kis, Bodoni (BT, Bauer), Gill Sans, Futura, Univers, Avenir\r\nOriginals:
  Helvetica/Neue, Gill Sans, Futura, Frutiger Linotype, Corbel, Franklin Gothic, News
  Gothic, Optima, Sero Office Medium\r\n\r\nThe pairing should not be too conservative,
  but should not grab too much attention either. It should feel somehow natural. How
  would the serifs pair for headlines, especially Fairfield and Kis?\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much for your help!"

  body: 'On a second thought, I will use Bitstream Dutch 809 (Concorde) instead. It
    is similar enough to Times New Roman for the layman. The reduced capital height
    and large x-heigt makes the caps and numbers stand out less, which gives the text
    a more even appearance and SC and OSF are not that much needed. '

  body: "Thank you for the comment. \r\nI will go for Dutch 809 (Concorde) without
    SC and OSF instead of the above mentioned solution of mixing two fonts. If anybody
    is interested in a comparison to Times: [[http://www.pdfhost.net/index.php?Action=Download&File=077b2c523391cca5f9754adabd6d5f93|here
    is a PDF]].\r\n\r\nDoes have anybody a recommendation for a headline companion?
    Would Fairfield fit? If not then I would go for Frutiger, News Gothic or Univers.\r\n\r\n"
