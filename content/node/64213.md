  direction anyhow. I\u2019m trying to find examples of typical Catholic ornamental
  art, first and foremost border elements and standalone ornaments. This is for a
  magazine piece on a Catholic publishing house. Please don\u2019t spend any time
  digging up stuff, but do drop a line if you know any good resources.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\u2013
