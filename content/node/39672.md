  body: "The sample is from a contemporary print ad. I can't go into much more detail
    than that since its WIP. Is it a custom typeface you think?\r\n\r\nAny help would
    be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: This is quite frustrating as I seem to recognize the overall shapes and that
    lowercase 'w', but none of the usual suspects have it in their library. I give
    up.
