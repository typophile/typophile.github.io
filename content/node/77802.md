  plus punctuation for an actual font release! Inspiration came from a custom logotype
  I created that was not commissioned, it's a great excuse to dive into FontLab and
  see what it's all about. This will be an all caps display font, released at some
  point this year. Here is a screenshot of the regular and outline versions. I've
  attached a PDF for closer inspection.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SNS6_5753.png]"

  body: Neat design Dave! I appreciate how the forms go against conventional expectations.
    Still, perhaps consider changing the shape of the C vs the G in the lower right
    to make them more easily recognizable.

    left one, to make one of those leaf shapes.\r\n\r\nThe G is good, but the C still
    needs ideas. Maybe the left half of U is what the bottom half of C should look
    like.\r\n\r\nMy favorite shape is A/V/Y. I'd like to see you try designing another
    X based on that."

    me, maybe you need to try with a different version of /C/. "

  body: "cerulean: Agree on rounding the bottom of the J, don't know why I didn't
    think of that already. The battle of the _C_ continues, I'll try your suggestion.
    I see what you're thinking regarding the _X_, wouldn't hurt to try. Honestly the
    _X_ is one of my favorite letters, thus far.\r\n\r\ndaniele: Thanks!"

  body: "- Is the E a little tight in the below the middle stroke?\r\n- Is the M a
    little big in the middle? (Maybe somewhere in between the 2 versions?)\r\n- Does
    the X look a bit a little too much like the Z? (Could be because I saw it and
    now cannot unsee it.)\r\n- Could the counters be so sharp?\r\n- Could the J be
    a little rounder?\r\n- Could the S be a little more round? \r\n\r\nQuite a difficult
    set of constraints. But some of the glyphs are a lot of fun. That's for sure.

    the left one, to make one of those leaf shapes.</em> | Heh. I was just thinking
    \"not the left one; that would make a leaf shape, which would be weird.\" Best
    to just try it both ways. Maybe there's somewhere else to make a leaf shape so
    it's not the only one. I guess the /R/ has something close (that's a really well
    refined glyph, by the way)\r\n\r\nI agree with Miss Tiffany's comments, except
    about /X/. The counters look better in the outline version, though. Not sure why,
    but they seem to fit there. Maybe curve just the top left of the /S/?\r\n\r\nI'd
    love to see a set of Katakana/Hiragana in this face. I don't expect you to do
    it, but it would be awesome."
