  now and my project is a Hookah bar called 'Deseos' I need some advice on the lettering,
  I enjoy what I've done already but need some constructive criticism in the next
  couple of days before I really have to finalize it and apply it to the system.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deseos1_5116.png]"

  body: "I really like it. I am trying to look at it from a point of view of the possiblity
    of someone missing something.\r\n\r\nThe stroke gets really thin on the s's. How
    the thin stroke moves back a lot on the last one and doesn't really define the
    s. The first one is clear but it almost seems like the thin stroke shouldn't be
    playing a role as much based on how its being used on the D and the o to s. \r\n\r\nOverall,
    maybe defining the second s more. And working on the connection from the second
    s to the smoke trail.\r\n\r\nIt still works. Perhaps continuing the thin stroke
    at the bottom. The tail of the 'smoke' is pretty thick. It might look neat of
    it got thin like the strokes you use at the top.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it looks very
    nice. Great start."

    though I'll be present rough concepts of logos tomorrow I'd like more professional
    lettering advice.

    my Sociology class :-D\r\n\r\nThis is the other idea I had, but I don't like it
    as much. We have to draw inspiration from a specific artist and I chose the surrealist
    period of Dali's works so this other idea doesn't work so much.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deseos_3532.2.png]"

  body: "I like the first one, but not the second. I agree with what Alex has said
    about making the smoke trail thinner and fixing the second 's' and connecting
    it with the trail. If it were connected, the whole logo would become one continuous
    stroke.\r\n\r\nI wonder if you could combine the ideas and put a hookah at the
    bottom of the first one, or if that would be too obvious/not subtle enough.\r\n\r\nAs
    it stands, the first one is really cool.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    can be readable when draw it little? Maybe you could try to unifie it a little

  body: "Maybe you could look at curving the 2nd stroke of the d (where it forms the
    join to the e) to the other side of the first stroke, sorry, I am confusing myself
    here, to make a smoother transition, more like the 2nd e, which would also make
    it more of a D shape. I think you can also have a bit more contrast in the first
    swoosh, under the os, it looks a bit sports logo compared to the others. Is the
    Dali inspiration his moustache?:)\r\nTim"

  body: The lettering is improved, but the smoke trail doesn't work as well in yur
    second version. I prefer the way the smoke looks in the first one, overall, but
    the tail of the smoke is better in the second.

  body: "Toni: I'll look at doing an in between as far as contrast goes, I actually
    sclaed this mark down to about an inch square and it didn't disappear as much
    as expected. What do you mean by 'unify it a little'? That's essentially what
    I was trying to do when I upped the contrast of the smoke to match the lettering.\r\n\r\nTim:
    It took me about 10 times of reading your comment to understand, but I do now!
    Agreed about the smoke immediately under the type. The Dali inspiration does in
    fact come from his moustache! AND his signature on some of his paintings/works
    that I found is a very high contrast script.\r\n\r\nBruce: As stated above I'll
    look into the smoke again, maybe see what a happy medium looks like. Thanks!"

    (actually it reminds me of the Desilu logo) and reduces ambiguity.\r\nTim"

  body: "I think it's a good start to the lettering, but if you're approaching this
    with the idea to keep in style with brush script work it needs some tweaking.
    Ideally you'd have a drawing tool in mind when you start out even if it's all
    digital.\r\n\r\nI wanted to bring it up because I feel it would help with trying
    to unify the thick/thin transitions in your smoke swash, The swells compared to
    the stems are way too thick; alternatively you could thicken up the thin part
    of the strokes a bit. I think the letters read rather well myself, and I wish
    I had my brush pen at the office to write this out because something about the
    joining of the _D_ to the _e_ is bothering me. \r\n\r\nAh, I think the stroke
    is too straight. :) Also the ending of your _o_ where it goes over the _s_ is
    a bit thin and it might be a problem with printing so you might want to add 2
    points to the end and thicken it out just a tad. I might also reduce the angle
    that you bring the smoke back up."

    you into trouble when it comes to making the restaurant's signs.\r\n\r\nSignage
    is an area not explored nearly enough when it comes to developing a brand ID program.
    Something that may look good on a printed page may be impossible to convert over
    to neon, channel letters and various other kinds of signs.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes
    to restaurants, the presentation of the store front to the outside world is very

    thin strokes can be an issue with printing I'm wondering if there is a solution

    take another look at this, today."
