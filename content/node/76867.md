body: "The fonts I create are display or poster fonts. I've worked mostly in the sign
  and screen print industry, so these are what I mostly use. My question, is there
  any reason to include document and math glyphs (such as mu, section, paragraph,
  etc.) in a font that no sane person would use on text applications? For signs, some
  of the math glyphs like the plus or minus glyph are necessary for acreages and legal
  descriptions. The other's seem pointless. I usually use those places for alternate
  characters and symbols. Would this, in theory, reduce the marketability of a font.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "I don't think one can determine how one's fonts will be used. Or misused.\r\nTypographers
    can be quite ingenious, if not downright perverse.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I have
    seen the Section symbol rotated through 90 degrees and used as a poster ornament.\r\n\r\nThe
    only area of discretion I would admit to typefounders in departing from standard
    encodings is to omit certain obsolete or obscure characters, such as Greenlandic
    k."

  body: "As for whether or not there is a reason to making such symbols in the font,
    I think that any character used in text could potentially be used in a display
    setting. Coming this summer: Paragraph 14, a legal drama (against the background
    of a huge, light-brown gavel: in black, the numerals '1' and '4' beside a chilling
    pilcrow). On March 15, the Statistics Society will be presenting a talk on population
    means (against a dark, business blue, taking up most of the poster space: a prominent
    mu).\r\n\r\nAs for the marketability, I have no idea."

  body: "I dropped the extra math characters from Mac Roman or Win 1252 from my fonts
    because anyone setting that stuff <em>should</em> use a typeface meant for setting
    math. I do leave in section because that one gets use in legal advertising. I
    don\u2019t waste effort on the generic currency symbol as it is only used by financial
    publications which do not use retail fonts. But I do draw pilcrows and daggers
    because I enjoy drawing them. A good baseline for these is H&FJ\u2019s Latin-X
    encoding: if they can sell that many fonts without those characters then it\u2019s
    pretty clear that nobody is complaining."

  body: "I used to leave out the never-gonna-get-used-anyway-math symbols (NGGUAMS)
    in display fonts. But I've had so many requests to fill in sets to please corporate
    clients that a couple of years ago I started adding them as a rule.\r\n\r\nVideogame
    companies very commonly require NGGUAMS. I don't know what it's like these days
    but when I used to make games, Sony would reject fonts that didn't have NGGUAMS.
    It didn't matter that they would never be used in-game, that was their policy.
    Sony will not listen to reason. My fonts tend to be used in videogames often so
    it's NGGUAMS all around.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NGGUAMS_4708.gif]"

    the paragraph mark in [[http://www.typography.com/testDriver/index.php?mode=characters&productLineID=100014|Knox]],
    for example, but you never know. Honestly the reason we include these things is
    that it's impossible to draw the line between what's useful and what's not: the
    slash? backslash? plusminus? asciitilde?\r\n\r\nJames, Latin-X is a spec for accented
