body: "Hi all,\r\nI'm designing a logo for a musician. The mark is combining the zodiac
  symbol for Pisces along with the idea of the guitar, though I didn't want any of
  those ideas to be too literal. I'm trying to express the idea of duality in music.
  Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

    you're trying too hard to avoid having the guitars look literal?"

      \"forced\" when it comes to the guitar idea? Im not sure what you mean when
      you say \"trying too hard to avoid having the guitars look literal\"\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nJustin"

  body: Yeah looks like mice or tadpoles or something. (And those thin white lines
    will disappear when the logo is printed small.) But it's an interesting concept;
    keep working on it.

  body: "It appears you made the body of the guitar pointed to suggest a fish (Pisces)
    and drew the sound hole far away from the neck for the same reason. I think you've
    moved too far away from <em>guitar</em>, but not close enough to <em>fish</em>,
    so that it doesn't read as either--at least to my eyes. \r\n\r\nMaybe if the guitar
    bodies didn't end in a point (some fish have rounded heads) it would work a little
    better. And if the tails ended in a shape that managed simultaneously to suggest
    a fish tail and the tuning pegs  of a guitar, maybe my brain wouldn't be so quick
    to decode them as mice. "

  body: Thanks everyone. I was a little concerned about the forms looking like rated
    "R" tadpoles. I'm going to keep plugging away at this one. Theres some potential
    but its not there yet.

    width=\"30\" height=\"40\"/>\r\n\r\nTry and play more with positive/negative space.
    What could represent duality better than that?"

  body: Your current versions aren't working. You're playing too much with colour
    and outer shapes. @picapusher+s right. duality is perfect for black and white,
    positive and negative space.
