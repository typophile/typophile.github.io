  body: "Eben\r\n\r\nMonotype Bell is based on this face and I've recently had the
    opportunity to use it for two projects, the first was a laser-printed chapbook
    and the second a letterpress printed broadside.\r\n\r\nAs a digital face it is
    a bit thin for text work and needs to be thickened a tad if printed via offset
    or laser, and for letterpress the larger sizes need to be thinned out a bit but
    once a decent range of sizes/weights are constructed its a very fine face to work
    with. It has quite a bit of traditional funk to it and yet yields a fairly even
    page. The 3/4 figures are a god-send. Since it is based on the metal face or more
    likely the photocomp version of machine comp version, it does have the usual Monotype
    quirks in regard to letter fit but those can be adjusted easily enough.\r\n\r\nRichard
    Austin cut the Bell for S & C Stephenson and they have a resemblance to the Scotch
    Roman that he also cut for the William Miller foundry, whose specimens Matthew
    Carter used as the basis for his Miller Text, Wilson Greek, and Georgia. Of the
    William Miller letterforms, Carter commented that they had a \u201Ccurvaceous
    ductus\u201D that set them apart!\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that Austin came
    up with the idea of the 3/4 figures that are often associated with the Scotch
    faces.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\n"
