    that come across the Internet and ask if they are kittens? I mean, when spam comes
    to my computer, and I open the email, I know pretty well that it is spam, and
    within a second it is deleted.\r\n\r\nAm I going to have to send some kind of
    approval message saying that I want each particular email sent to me?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "RE: Don McCahill\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to prevent that spam from even getting
    <em>into</em> your email box before you can read it. It's not about spam filtration
    though. It's about preventing spammers from getting into people's accounts and
    it's about keeping spammers from creating computer controlled email accounts that
    automatically send out junk.\r\n\r\nBy preventing them from registering, you are
    preventing them from sending out junk."
