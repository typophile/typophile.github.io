    Eric says. It has been narrowed/stretched vertically, but that is the only obvious
    thing to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    crossbar is high, the top of this /P/ is not horizontal, and this /G/''s crossbar

    Lydian]], since I think they were the originating foundry in it's pre-digital
    form. \r\n\r\nHmm. The same differences appear to be present. I wonder who else
    has a version that matches these details you noted? [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=242888&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=77259&query=LISBON&SCOPE=Fonts|CG
    Lisbon]] is just like the Lydians we mentioned. \r\n\r\nWhy would someone draw
    something so similar to Lydian?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think it's fascinating how similar Chappell's typeface is to this one \"Stahl\".
    It wouldn't be the first time a foundry was 'inspired' by work from another foundry.
    According to Jaspert's Encyclopaedia Lydian was done for ATF between 1938 and
    1946, not Monotype, as I had thought. McGrew's book says Lydian Bold Condensed
    was the last one designed. No mention is made in either book of \"Stahl\" as being
    similar.\r\n\r\nFrom what I could find looking at the Klingspor Museum site, Stahl
    is not a Rudolf Koch design. In fact, on [[http://www.linotype.com/49-14024/19331962.html|Linotype's
    page on the Klingspor Foundry's typeface collection]] it lists Stahl as the work
    of H. K\xFChne, in 1939, a year after Chappell's design of Lydian.\r\n\r\n- Mike
