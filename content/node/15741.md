  the font:\r\nDirty Headline by S. John Ross - on dafont.com /in Fancy > Eroded?
  Or indeed another face that is as clean with both character sets?\r\n\r\nI need
  a set and nothing available that I can see in my searches through most supplliers
  and foundries. Most \"grunge\" fonts are pretty bad and not a patch on this one.
  This face looks like it was taken from an old letterpress or woodtype and has all
  the characteristics of one and is \"clean\" in its ink spread, etc. Only thing is,
  it has no lower case characters.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions or help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\ncheers"

      can be worked. Don't know how I missed it - perhaps it's 'stamp-like' effect
      threw me as I've been looking for something more press-like. Any ideas on the

  body: If your use is limited to a word or two just use Mr. Retro Machine Wash. It
    puts an effect on a layer mask in photoshop. The beauty of that is you can control
    how much (noise/grunge) you want. This way you can use any typeface you want.

  body: "The problems using distressed fonts are that if used as a large size the
    grunge effects are not at all convincing and if used in a longish phrase the repeated
    letters all have the same effect, so Dan's advice is probably a better bet.\r\n\r\nbtw
    Dan, you should be on a commision from Mr Retro (or are you Mr Retro?)\r\n\r\nTim"

    body: "Thanks Dan and TimD, your suggestion of using Mr.Retro or indeed any effect
      through P'shp is good as a final step but I would really rather use a well constructed
      face; call me a stick-in-the-mud, hey.\r\nAnd yes, most grunge fonts do have
      that problem of repetitiveness but this where you CAN use P'shp to counter this
      OR just use real letterpress to get the actual effects of ink spread, etc. However,
      I'm trapped into using digital processes for this job.\r\nMany thanks guys -
      invaluable ideas."

  body: No Tim I have no relationship with Mr. Retro other than use the product and
    recomend anything that is non-destructive to pixels in photoshop. When Adobe makes
    CS3 I hope they eliminate the eraser tool since its not needed and is distructive.
    Also layer masks allow experimenting with different typefaces and you don't have
    to lower yourself to rather crappy designed grunge type faces.

    can use a decent font for the basis, have control over the effect and avoid repetition
    are strong points. And as you are a fan I don't see why you shouldn't make as
    many aware of it as possible, I meant it as a light-hearted aside to my points
    about scale and repetition.\r\nTim"
