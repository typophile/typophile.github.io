  to get as close to the original font of the \"coffee\" part as possible.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nMy
  machine is too worn on the outside (I can barely see where the big \"GAGGIA\" was)
  \r\n\r\nAttached is the best photo I could find and a 400% blow up where I tried
  to make it more identifiable. (corrected perspective and high contrast) identyfont
  and whathefont where frustrating to use.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I think \"coffee\" is probably a font (something like Imago, although not
    the \"e\") but \"GAGGIA\" seems to be a one-off rendering... by somebody who doesn't
    know how letters work. It's made of pure geometry (look at the bad curve-to-line
    transitions, and the overly small aperture of the \"A\"); the good news is that
    makes it easy to reproduce.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      ... damn low picture resolution is driving me nuts."

  body: "@hrant: You are right about the GAGGIA on all points :) I already reproduced
    the Gaggia but was struggling with the \"coffee\". Mainly because I don't have
    the original and the images I could find are low resolution.\r\n\r\n@defiatone:
    I tried Franklin Gothic. Franklin Gothic Demi comes surprisingly close. That's
    one typeface I wouldn't have tried. Thanks! It's not quite right, though\r\n\r\nI'm
    wondering about those cuts at the ends of the \"c\"... Could that be a part of
    the original font?"

  body: if it's really old, the pre-digital typeface may be slightly different than
    any you will find now anyhow.

  body: "@Michael Boyer: nice find on the Manual! I think I'll have to superimpose
    the version from the picture with the one from the manual ... something usefull
    and at least resembling the original should come out of that. THANKS!\r\n\r\n@defiatone:
    this model was built between 1983 and 1987 is that old enough for it to have used
    a \"pre-digital typeface\" ?"

      best quality and leaves less room for guessing. \r\nThank you, everyone! This
      has been amazingly fast and productive! I hope to give something back here one
      day. Might have to learn a bit more until then, though."
