  nice geometric sans, maybe something along the lines of Futura or Gotham, just not
  their current Century Gothic.\r\n\r\nThings to note: Circular lc \"o\", shouldn't
  be techie-looking, should be totally cool. I'm stuck.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: I've highlighted a few in <a href="http://newstoday.com/typecase/archive.php?id=21">Newstoday's
    QBN Typecase</a>, including <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=PRC.118797.0.0">Bryant</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=relay">Relay</a>.
    Also underused but lovely is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11133.0.0">FF
    Super Grotesk</a>, a newer take on Futura. And I've always loved <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=nobel">Nobel</a>,
    both Font Bureau's version and <a href="http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/NobelRegular.html">DTL's</a>.

  body: Ah! Actually, I presented SuperGrotesk to the client but he wants something
    with a bigger x-height, which I think is a good beef for this project. Thought
    about Bryant... Lemme look at Relay a bit more. Gotham would definitely please
    client, but it's sooo everywhere. I'm looking long and hard at Locator, another
    EOlson face. Lemme look at that link for a while. Thanks, Stephen!

  body: Larger x-height -- would you consider going grotesque rather than geometric?
    Look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=LH.121032.0.0">Vectora</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FK.112464.0.0">Spiegel</a>.

  body: I second the recommendation of Proxima Nova. Just licensed it for a business
    magazine prototype, and it's quite handsome and versatile.

  body: Yeah, Proxima Nova would work great. I was even looking at your fonts for
    research, but for some reason I skipped over it. I am also looking at Galaxie
    Polaris, which isn't exactly what I'm looking for, but it could work as well.
    Thanks for the suggestions!
