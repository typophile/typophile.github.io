  body: "Um, I think the poster meant how to do it w/o spending $400 to $600 on a
    separate math editor program.....\r\n\r\nIf I recall, Math Type can be bought
    as a separate program, when you do, it gives you the option of exporting equations
    as EPS images. Then, you can simply place the equation as an EPS graphic in a
    page layout program like ID. I'm pretty sure it's less than $100 for those with
    educational discounts, though it was back with Word 6/Mac OS 8.5 when I did this.\r\n\r\n"

  body: You should be able to do this through saving Word document as a pdf, there
    is a free plugin from Microsoft to do that. If I am not mistaken, this way we
    prepared our math booklet.

  body: "The only problem with the pdf approach is that you lose maximum resolution
    compared to saving it as EPS, no? If you create the equation in Word via Equation
    Editor at the EXACT same point size you wish it to appear in ID, then you'd be
    OK with the pdf approach I guess. But if you ever needed to resize the graphic,
    you'd potentially have problems if ultimately printing to a high resolution device.\r\n"

  body: "I asked my typesetting colleagues a very similar question about three months
    ago, and got the following reply concerning their current workflow from Word files
    to InDesign:\r\n\r\n<em>For Journals which are set in InDesign, we were so far
    setting the equationas as fixed graphics and using them as images during composition.
    With this process the equations cannot be edited directly from InDesign. As a
    recent development, we are planning to export the equations directly from MathType
    Equation Editor and embeddin gthese within InDesign. Any corrections can be done
    from InDesign itself by double clicking that equation which opens up MathType
    Editor. This will be implemented shortly.</em>\r\n\r\n...Now, I don't know whether
    that did happen (yet) ... it sounds like the Equation Editor file is an OLE object.
    Does InDesign support OLE? \r\n\r\n[edit] Adobe's \"Help resource centre\" seems
    to confirm that it doesn't... in which case I wonder how my colleagues were planning
    on implementing the above.? [end edit]\r\n___________________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: Thanks for that Serge. My school is on Word 2002 right now, but when we get
    moved up to Word 2007 then it might be useful.

  body: "I've had a reply from my typesetting colleagues, who say \"We have developed
    scripts to link MathType objects within InDesign file. Using this scripts we can
    edit / save the equations within InDesign\" ... I get the impression they're not
    going to be more forthcoming than that, but it sounds like forking out for the
    full version of MathType (which, as Ryan says, isn't too expensive) will get you
    part of the way there. \r\n\r\nDon't forget if you go down the PDF route there
    are third-party freeware utilities for creating PDFs (if you're prepared to put
    up with nag screens) - I used PDF995 until my company stumped up for Acrobat -
    so you shouldn't have to wait for the upgrade to Word 2007 just for the MS plugin...\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: I had to do this a few times a year or so ago. I would place the equation
    in an empty Word document (legal-sized landscape worked well) and then resize
    that to about 3x the print size (Word still treats it all as vector data, so the
    resize is no problem). Export that to PDF (used Adobe PDF exporter for Word, but
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/">PDFCreator</a> works well,
    too). Save a copy of the Word doc in case you need to make edits/corrections later,
    and then just place the PDF into InDesign as you would any other image. Since
    it's oversized, it'll look perfectly fine when you scale it down to regular size.
