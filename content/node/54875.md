  to the font I'm working on, I reprinted a testpage with the updated font. Several
  glyphs near the end of the character set shifted two places to the right. That is-
  in the glyph palette (Illustrator), the font is the same except for the newly appended
  characters. All the unicode and other names are the same (and correct),\r\nbut on
  my testpage: ^ became ?, and 1925 became 3e(swash)47 (alternate #s). Other characters
  between these were not affected.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any idea why this would happen?
  Is this a mistake I can learn from, or just a random glitch?\r\n\r\nThe font is
  .otf, and I haven't added any extra Opentype features."
