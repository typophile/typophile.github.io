body: "Hi! I am designing my own wedding invitation, and I am struggling to find a
  typeface that works.  My invite  is not the traditional \"fancy\" invitation.  (I
  have polka dots on the back)  The body of the text is in gill sans, and now I'm
  looking for a font for our names.  I'd like it to be a bolder, graphic, simple typeface,
  but I am not opposed to any suggestions.  (I tried impact, but I think it is too
  boring)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nBrice"
