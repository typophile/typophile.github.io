		<div class="commentbody">Of course, I was just saying I have additonal respect in this particular instance. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The tricky matter with history is to work on it leaving apart prejudices.

I'm thinking about the incredible series of bad luck and misfortunes passed by Abraham Lincoln before becoming Presidents of the US at the age of 51. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This &quot;parallel of sorts&quot; occurred to me reading a book on self-esteem by David Brooks and Rex Dalby, always in italian edition. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem is the lack of information available on the childhood/teenage years/young age of Hitler. If you read Zitelmann's and some parts of the Mein Kampf you can see how much many decisions of Hitler came out of frustration and despair, although Hitler does not admit it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If Hitler had met a sensitive and good hearted person or friend (or more) in his Vienna years we could have ended up having a painting artist instead of a self-destructing dictator.</div>

Our cultural   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->experiences shape our understandings.

(At least, in San Diego, where I grew up,   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->most of the Hispanics are Mexicans. I'll apologize now if   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other Hispanic groups in the US use it).

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;I think the separation can certainly be useful [for helping out blackletter], it's just a bit devious to pretend they're not related. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You've summarized the problem in treating the issue very good, Hrant. I'll keep the separation, as Butler suggested, and it will not be a project on the swastika. But the nazist swastika usage will be addressed in one way or the other. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't share the fatalistic attitude towards history's inability to help reflections and understand past errors (&quot;teaching lessons&quot; is more pretentious). An example is Paul's assumption on the arab Israeli people. The preconceptions against islamic culture are not a byproduct of so-called &quot;compassion&quot; towards the hebrew one (compassion is hardly an excuse for another form of violence). The preconceptions against islam are constantly reinforced by its fanatic fringes (which, of course, does not represent the actual religious beliefs) and the fact that christianity (but mostly so-called &quot;christianity&quot; and occidental culture in general) fears Islam. To me, and I am catholic, this is senseless, but it's a pretty diffused fear (especially in the US). We should turn back this attitude against the american reaction to the terrorism also. I wrote a letter to a Senator and to the US President, from the Food First webpages, as Emigre talked about it, knowing perfectly that it wouldn't have served nothing. They went ahead with their &quot;military systems&quot;. But I did. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, I think it would be better to save further ideas for a specific thread, if you agree. We're straying a little off the path while I would concentrate more specifically on the issues connected to the blackletter usage as propaganda. We may do one when I will decide to work on this book project, if you like the idea. I would love to have the opinion of many designers. I just don't know when&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you wish to keep talking of the issue, please start a new thread, so people can notice it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you, John. In the future your forum will be a gem. Promised. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks, Hrant! Who is GMM? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The observations on your page are pertinent, but as you pointed out, the presence of archaic forms and an overtly decorative attitude often reduced the legibility of blackletters. Most roman fonts have an abundance of rounded shapes, many textura are too angular and so they present similar problems. Anyway cross-pollination between the two styles it's a great undiscovered territory. After all, blackletter calligraphy derived from the same roman forms as many unattractive latin faces of today.</div>
