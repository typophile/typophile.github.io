  Don&#39;tcha Like Me?? font I posted a few weeks ago - it was Fontalicious&#39;
  <a href="http://www.fontalicious.com/super/jenk.html">Jenkins 2.0</a> - the K gives
  it away.   <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/52156.png"

  body: Actually, it&#39;s probably the original <a href="http://www.fontalicious.com/super/jenkins.html">Jenkins</a>,

  body: I think there are two fonts, including a Jenkins Thick in version 2, so I
    think the Jenkins script is the same, just  has numbers added and the newThick
    version. <BR> <BR>Thanks for following up on that. It&#39;s a new addition for
    the Script Font ID Guide.
