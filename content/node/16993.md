    body: "Both Atlantica and Esta are OK. \r\nHowever I'm actually looking for something
      that would be less nostalgic and more straight and newsy. Large xheight and
      ability to be tightly kerned is a must. \r\nThe Daily Teleraph font is perfect
      because it's less romantic than Basilia* and it's more sexy than Palatino* while
      keeping elegant vertical accent of Fenice*. \r\nDo you think I won't finf alternate?\r\nknap\r\n*just
      examples"

    from ShinnType. The vertical stress is missing, but it could be seen as newsy
    for display purposes.
