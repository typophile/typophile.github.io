body: "I was recently setting a document in Baskerville (whichever foundry Apple uses,
  presumably), but something kept bugging me. \u201CBut you like Baskerville,\u201D
  I kept saying. It wasn\u2019t until I saw the PDF that I realized what was going
  on. The version of Baskerville that I\u2019m using is a weird one, almost to the
  point of being a slab serif.\r\n\r\nAll this got me to thinking, I need a good roman
  serif font. In the past, when I had a good copy of Baskerville, I used that, but
  now I might as well find one that I really like. I have been quite taken by Edward
  Johnston. In particular, I really like faces that show that they were designed by
  a calligrapher who was holding a pen.\r\n\r\nI know that Johnston worked on Imprint,
  which has many good qualities, but Johnston\u2019s foundational hand is not one
  of them. A better way to describe Imprint might be that it was made by a bunch of
  other designers and also Johnston. A good copy of Baskerville is something I\u2019ll
  need eventually, but I might be better off buying a non-expert version of that for
  now and spending the money for a full copy of something I really want.\r\n\r\nI
  know that if you asked Edward Johnston which font he would like, he\u2019d probably
  throw things at you, but does anyone have any recommendations for a font that Edward
  Johnston would like using as a template?"

  body: As far as I know, Apple pre-installed version of Baskerville (Datafork Truetype
    font - aka .dfont) is derived from an early Monotype's digital version; not an
    optimal one, but neither anything resembling something "almost to the point of
    being a slab serif". I'd be curious to see your pdf, by the way, to see exactly
    how that Baskerville looks.

    Just compared to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/baskerville-old-face/|URW++\u2019s
    Baskerville Old Face]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/baskerville-book-bq/|
    Berthold\u2019s Baskerville]], it seems like they didn\u2019t put any care into
    the serifs at all.  Just, the stroke has ended, so let's slap a big ol\u2019 rectangle
    on it.\r\n\r\nAnd since I\u2019m using this for a large display font (not a critical
    work, just to set something in a PDF to stick onto an e-reader), the lack of craft
    will be noticeable.  It\u2019s not critical for this work, which is why I\u2019m
    not simply switching to a better font that I already have, but going forward,
    I'd like to solicit ideas before I need them."

title: Baskerville or Imprint?  Or probably neither
