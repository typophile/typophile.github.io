body: There are occasions in Fontlab when two (or more?) glyph names automatically
  generate the same Unicode character (e.g. <em>arrowleftup</em> and <em>uni2196</em>).
  My question is, is there a list of the glyph names which map to a particular Unicode
  character and if so where? I guess this query is likely to be related to a wider
  topic of how best to name your glyphs which may have gone before. Ring any bells?

    contain files with the \".nam\" extension. From within FLS, you may set your default
    mapping file in the preferences/options dialog \"General Options / Unicode and
    OpenType\" and choose a particular mapping file e.g. when you use functions like
    \"Glyph / Glyph Names / Generate Unicode ...\". Indeed there were a couple of
    Typophile threads indirectly dealing with them, maybe you'll find some by googling
    with the keywords \"glyph\" and \"naming\".\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "By default, FontLab Studio uses the standard.nam mapping file. If a glyphname
    in this file is preceded with an exclamation mark, then FLS will generate a Unicode
    codepoint if it finds such name but it will not generate this name for a given
    Unicode codepoint. If a glyphname is not preceded with an exclamation mark, then
    FLS will generate a Unicode codepoint if it finds such name and it will generate
    this name for a given Unicode codepoint. If for a given Unicode codepoint, the
    list does not contain a name without an exclamation mark, the name uniXXXX will
    be used (where XXXX is the hexadecimal notation of the Unicode codepoint). \r\n\r\nIn
    other words, for any Unicode codepoint, a .nam file should contain no more than
    one glyphname without an exclamation mark but it may contain any number of names
    with an exclamation mark. To quickly covert your glyph naming from \"obsolete\"
    to \"current\" glyph naming, first choose Glyph / Glyph Names / Generate Unicode
    and then Glyph / Glyph Names / Generate Names. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
