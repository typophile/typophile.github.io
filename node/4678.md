  body: I find rich your comment, however many other types are conceived in the same
    way.   <BR>I believe that the creation should not limit if.   <BR>Open your thoughts.

  body: It&#39;s fine to do this treatment of Arial for a logo or something. But it&#39;s
    certainly unethical to use the Arial design without attribution, and in most countries
    illegal if you used the actual Arial outlines to create a derivative typeface.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s true that many shareware and freeware typefaces are conceived
    this way. That&#39;s because it is easy to do -- much easier than designing a
    new typefaces from scratch. But it&#39;s much less common for retail typefaces,
    for the reasons I mention above. <BR> <BR>I am actually quite impressed with the
    type sample and presentation, by the way. It&#39;s very effective graphic design.
    <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thank you for the comment.   <BR>Yes I agree with you on creating sources
    the starting from small alterations in your form.   <BR>More in the case of Serial
    Killer there were a development process and creation.   <BR>The type was conceived
    by a printer mistake, we used several wrong impressions until arriving in that
    result.   <BR>Even with that result we tried to make photocopies to win still
    more the dirty aspect.   <BR>Thank you once again for the comment.   <BR>Excuse
    me for my terrible English. hehehehe!!!! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'John, what about the entire 90s?!  ;-&#41; <BR>In fact my biggest complaint
    about Marcio&#39;s work&#42; is that it&#39;s a decade late. <BR> <BR>&#42; I
    mean his fonts - some of his compositions are great. <BR> <BR>As for &#34;plagiarism&#34;:
    pragmatically, I think it&#39;s not so bad if the font is modified enough that
    nobody would use the derivative instead of the original. On the other hand, revealing
    any &#34;effort-saving&#34; tactics are always in order, at least among fellow
    designers. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Is the idea to sell this font? If you started with the outlines from Arial,
    as certainly appears to be the case from the graphic above, it would be an infringement
    of copyright to sell the font. Serial Killer appears to be what is legally known
    as a derivative work. A derivative work can only be made, used and distributed
    with the permission of the original copyright holder, excepting as permitted by
    fair use laws in individual countries. <BR> <BR>A derivative work may involve
    considerable original work -- indeed, it may account for most of the &#39;new&#39;
    font, and all of what makes it distinctive -- but so long as a font makes use
    of another copyrighted work, it is considered a derivative work.

    present at this forum.   <BR>in any moment I published something to send sale.   <BR>Serial
    Killer is an experiment that I accomplished behind at times.   <BR>Finally it
    will please some and to displease others.   <BR>   <BR>Thank you
