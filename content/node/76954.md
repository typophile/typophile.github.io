body: "Hello fellow Typophiles!\r\nMy name is Jordan Bell and I have been working
  on this Sans for about 3 months now. I study graphic design and typography at Abilene
  Christian University as a junior and have taken an Intro to Typography course. I
  realized at the beginning of this semester that I am hopelessly obsessed with typography.
  So, I started drawing! It started with sketches inspired by fonts such as Info,
  Dekar, Titillium, and Klavika. I then decided to try to learn how to use Fontlab
  Studio 5. After reading lots of reviews, tutorials, and blogs, I started drawing
  in Fontlab and Illustrator. In other words, I am a beginner. \r\n\r\nAfter many,
  many hours hovering over my laptop, editing, analyzing and tweaking this font, my
  professor told me I need some other professional critique. So, here I am! Please
  be gentle though. This is the first typeface I have designed and I know there are
  some kerning and small design problems, but I really would like to hear what you
  pro's have to say about the design and readability of the characters. But really,
  I'll take any feedback good or bad. \r\n\r\nbtw, I have updated the examples! The
  first two are former comps. The last 2 are the newest and best examples. Please
  review and critique. Thanks for any potential help!Enjoy\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example(typophile)2_6583.png]"

  body: "I can certainly see the Titillium and Klavika influences. There's also a
    fair bit of Interstate in there as well, I think. Your challenge should be to
    differentiate it from Titillium, because at the moment, they are remarkably close.
    A few comments:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>T = straighten the left-hand crossbar</li>\r\n<li>e
    = the terminal is wider than the rest of the stroke</li>\r\n<li>q = where the
    bowl meets the stem, it looks too steep. Try raising the stem.</li>\r\n<li>J =
    very narrow!</li>\r\n<li>w (regular italic) = it looks unbalanced? Is it wider
    on the right than on the left?</li>\r\n<li>P = interesting terminal on the stem.
    Have you investigated giving the same terminals to all uppercase strokes with
    stems that terminate on the baseline?</li>\r\n</ul>"

  body: "Thanks CaleD for your comments!\r\nHave you ever finished writing a paper,
    print it out, then notice like, 10 mistakes? Thats kinda what happened to me here.
    Right as I posted those, I noticed quite a few problems. I agree with everything
    that you stated and I am currently editing them now. As for the P terminal, I
    have thought about adding it to the other applicable characters, but really wanted
    some feedback on it first; so this helps out alot! Now, to the Titillium reference,
    I did hand draw all these on Fontlab, so its not like I copied them or anything,
    but your right. I should try to make some of the very similar characters more
    unique. \r\nOnce again, thanks for the suggestions! "

  body: the italic /Q/s all have dissonant tails to their regular counterparts. I
    like how the regular /Q/s do not let their tails into their counters, however
    the italics do. if that makes sense.

  body: Ah yes, the italic Q. I have spent many hours over the Q and it still fails
    me. Do you think I should change the Italic Q so that the tails are all the same
    and not in the counter? Or do you think they are ok? I mean, There is still some
    cleaning up to do with the tails, but what do you think?

  body: "I have been doing more work on this typeface in the past couple of weeks
    so I posted up some more example sheets (v3). Currently I am adding more glyphs
    - working on old-style numerals, automatic and discretionary ligatures - hoping
    that this will make my family  larger more complete and impressive. Even though
    it is still in progress, I would like more feedback please! I will be posting
    updates soon probably. \r\nThanks all for any potential help,\r\n\r\n-jb"
