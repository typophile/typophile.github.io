body: If anyone can ID the font in the logo on this site I&#39;ll be eternally grateful
  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s quite small, but very distinctive, I had thought Futura Display,
  but that&#39;s not quite right. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.eurocarparks.com/"

  body: Which font are you looking for? Is it the small, yellow, and round-cornered
    face in the upper right-hand corner logo? <BR> <BR>The larger sans-serif is <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/arial/narrow-mt/?s=Euro%20Car%20Parks%20is%20Parking">Arial
    Narrow</a>.

    Sans Bold</a> from Elsner&#43;Flake is similar to the rounded one.

  body: Richard, what makes you say it&#39;s not <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/futura-nd-display/futura-nd-display/testdrive.html?s=euro%20cars%20park&amp;p=24"
    target="_blank"> Futura Display</a>? <BR>Maybe it&#39;s just the pixelization
    which makes it look  <BR>different, or it has been tweaked a little.

  body: Yves, I think you&#39;re probably right. <BR> <BR>I was comparing a film pos
    about 200mm long&#40;I work in screen print company&#41; with an old Letraset
    book. <BR> <BR>I think that rather than &#34;tweaked a little&#34; it was probably
    a dodgy redraw by my predecessor who hadn&#39;t identified the font, and didn&#39;t
    have clue what he was trying to reproduce. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post an image later
    if I get time. <BR> <BR>Thanks again.
