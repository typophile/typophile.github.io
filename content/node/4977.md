  body: Hey, you know I&#39;m there.  <BR> <BR>But I can&#39;t decide between Sumner&#39;s
    workshop and the one on photopolymer plates. I&#39;m really interested in learning
    more about letterpress. But I have a huge respect for Sumner&#39;s knowledge and
    would love to learn from him. &#40;I was so bummed when, at the last minute, he
    couldn&#39;t make his presentation to ATypI Boston in 1999.&#41; <BR> <BR>The
    perennial dilemma -- which workshops to choose? <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: Kent, I suspect PPL letterpress will be a serious draw for you - you might
    find yourself totally engrossed in it - this is as much a warning as anything
    else! :-&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, when will we have more schedule details? Specifically
    I&#39;m wondering about Sunday. I remember what Kent said happened to him last
    year &#40;or was it the year before?&#41; and I&#39;d like to time things just
    right. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: BTW, I was just checking hotel pricing, and both Orbitz and Expedia are actually
    showing the Nikko at a <i>lower</i> rate than the conference &#34;special&#34;...
    :-/  It&#39;s $129 per night for a Queen room instead of $139. <BR> <BR>Better
    have a talk with them about the swindle. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    Square? Is it a big advantage to fly into SFO instead? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Be afraid of the $129 rooms... very afraid. No swindle involved. Those are
    the Petite Queens, and they are tiny. They were designed for flight crew &#40;the
    Nikko is owned by Japan Airlines&#41;, but they are available to anyone. Note
    the description says best suited for one traveler. I&#39;ve heard from people
    who have stayed in both that the extra $10 a night for the &#39;con rate will
    be well worth it in comfort.

  body: 'Still working on the schedule... I will having something tentative after
    the weeked. <BR> <BR>Flying into SFO or OAK is quite a bit easier and much cheaper
    unless you go by public transport which sounds a bit complicated in this case.
    I&#39;ll see what else I can find and put it on the site later. <BR> <BR>Taxi:
    Average cab fare from downtown San Francisco to SJC: $110-$120 <BR> <BR>Public
    Transportation <BR>There are no direct options between San Francisco and SJC.
    You&#39;ll have to connect to the VTA Airport Flyer from BART or CalTrain.  <BR>
    <BR>SF Gate has some good info on transport to/from the 3 main local airports.

  body: Oh, useful elaboration on the rooms! Maybe put that on the site, since $10
    a night extra seems totally worth it - for one thing a larger room can take two
    people. <BR> <BR>&#62; They were designed for flight crew <BR> <BR>Noting that
    for most Japanese people the petite Queen will seem <i>huge!</i> :-&#62; <BR>&#40;I&#39;m
    not talking about lack of height, but Tokyo cramping.&#41; <BR> <BR>San Jose is
    looking bad, then. The thing is, affordable flights from Burbank &#40;much easier
    for me than LAX&#41; only go SJ... So I might just drive &#40;solo or con otros
    font-fanaticos&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Tamye&#39;s right. Speaking as somebody who lived there until recently, you
    absolutely don&#39;t want to fly into San Jose, unless you&#39;re going to go
    up to SF with somebody from San Jose. <BR> <BR>Now it is true that Adobe HQ is
    about 5 minutes from the SJ airport, so if you know folks from Adobe, there are
    possibilities there. But otherwise it&#39;s a lousy idea. <BR> <BR>T

  body: OK, thanks. <BR>If I fly I&#39;ll probably just go into SFO and pay the $80
    difference. Normally I&#39;d drive, especially since I&#39;d have a car there.
    I&#39;m from LA, you see. :-&#41; But in this case there&#39;s the daily $15-25
    valet charge at virtually any hotel in the Union Square vicinity, so... <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Yesss, sorry about the FontLab workshop. It sold out fast last year, but this
    was truly record-breaking. I think it took all of 36 hours or something nutty
    like that. And over a holiday weekend yet! <BR> <BR>Luckily, there are 19 other
    workshops... including the delicious dilemma of choosing between Sumner and PPL.
    <BR> <BR>EDIT --- Oh now I see why that weird code thing happens. Ty to edit your
    weird spelling mistakes and pay the price.

  body: Randy, are you from NY or SF?  :-&#41; <BR>CalTrain looks like an option,
    although the walk from the station to Union Square might be somewhat too legionnaire
    for me, con maletas - it depends on the elevation changes, I guess. <BR> <BR>hhp

    to the Oakland airport to pick people up and bring them to the Nikko. But not
    during the day Thursday, as I was one of the lucky ones who got the FontLab workshop

    although I think you can get a three day tourist pass for something like $7. <a
    href="http://www.sfmuni.com/l15_3img/pacbmapc.gif">Here&#39;s a map</a> of the
    N Judah line &#40;those directions are for going in the opposite direction though&#41;.
    You&#39;d probably want to get off at Powell Street station. <BR> <BR>The elevation
    is pretty flat though if you really want to slog it.

  body: I think it&#39;s pretty easy to go from the Oakland airport to SF. You take
    a little shuttle to the station, then get on a train that goes directly to SF.
    The whole trip costs about $6, I think.

    my offer to shuttle people from Oakland to SF if the timing can be worked out

    unless there was a few of us you could bundle. My plan is to get there by noon
    Thursday, and leave early afternoon Sunday&#42;. Anybody else in one of those
    slots? <BR> <BR>&#42; Depending on the conference program action around then.
