<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hrant, <br> <br>To further clarify what is 'bait': I mean a personal attack that diverts from the topic discussion. An attack on the other person's character, motives, professional competence, etc. is 'bait'even if the attack is based on truth. <br> <br>Disagreements about typography, design etc would not be 'bait'.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>Our posts overlapped. Playwright Tennessee Williams said, <br> <br>"All cruel people describe themselves as paragons of frankness." <br> <br>I don't mean to label you with this quote, but do I use it to make clear that candor is not the only virtue. In any case, it is perfectly possible to be candid about typography etc without being candid about what a knave or fool you think the other person is. What positive purpose is served by name calling? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>When I'm cruel, and I sometimes am, that's my failing, and I generally try to correct myself (assuming I even realize it). Usually when I "offend" it's simply because the other party doesn't like hearing the truth, even if it can only ever be a truth for a few other people. That's <i>their</i> failing. <br> <br>Candor is indeed not the only virtue, but I feel it's more important than tact, or even token respect. <br> <br>If you care about something, you'll be candid about it. If you have an acquaintance with a nose the size of an elephant's trunk, and you notice that it's preventing the person from getting a date, you'd be helping everybody by suggesting he consider getting a nose job. If the person is too insecure to handle a mere suggestion, that's not your fault - you did the right thing. <br> <br>> What positive purpose is served by name calling? <br> <br>If you mean what I'm thinking, almost nothing. Calling somebody a "jackass" for example has no constructive value (except hopefully to trigger a fruitful opposing reaction - sometimes things have to hit bottom to bounce back), less because it's name-calling and more because it simply can't physically be true! But that sort of thing is pretty rare here. <br> <br>But when (on another list) I say something like "Mr X is so blinded by calligraphy that he has trouble avoiding psychological lethargy in type design", and a certain person thinks this is grounds for expelling me from the list (even though Mr X is not even a listmember!), then that person is an <i>intolerant</i>, and will never be at harmony in a multicultural milieu, unless he/she changes <i>inside</i>, as opposed to changing other people's superficial behavior. <br> <br>This is what we're really dealing with: <br>Insecurities turning into livid reactions, not merely feeling insulted at name-calling. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

Assuming your opinion is opposed to somebody else's (happily a very common thing!) then you simply can't be maximally understood and totally "polite" at the same time.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, who would have known you would have been getting free therapy here? Progress, progress, progress. <br> <br>I'll admit, I have not been around here forever. But I do regularly read, if I do not participate, in many of the posts around here however. I do not read every one I admit. It would take to much time and I must make a living. <br> <br>I do however, perhaps more than anyone else's, follow Hrant's posts. I find the discussions he participates in to be, more often than not, learning experiences. For that I am grateful. And for the most part (I've been around about a year now I think) I have not seen Hrant attack anyone who did not deserve it. <br> <br>In fact, many times, it seems as if a few have logged on for the purpose of attacking him. <br> <br>I feel that if anyone has been inappropriate around here, in proportion to the total number of times they have posted, it would be &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;. <br> <br>Well, Hrant, I would think that enough of the people around here would indeed know you well enough ( even on a forum ) not to be so offended by some of the things you say. It seems, according to your accusers, that you say these things often enough that they would carry little weight by now. But obviously you are respected. Not matter how many times you post <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>I for one, think it is wonderful, that you put with all of this, and still you are willing to share what you know about type. <br> <br>Thanks. <br> <br>Sean <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I've applied my own rigorous 72 hour rule for this <br>reply. If you read any of this at all, please read the <br>whole thing so I'm not misunderstood. <br> <br>I hope I can say this once and get it off my chest <br>forever. More than that I hope Hrant doesn't respond. <br>I've written drafts of this letter many times over the <br>span of my involvement here; some for Hrant in private, <br>some for the public. Most sat forever, unposted. One or <br>two got sent to him privately as formal censures, but <br>wait; Jared got to write those. <br> <br>I've never commented publicly, mainly because I didn't <br>think Hrant would take it as helpful criticism and also <br>because I thought posting it online would be <br>inappropriate. <br> <br>In some ways I'm posting this in hopes we can move on. <br>In other ways, I'm really hoping Hrant is listening for <br>his sake and ours (so he can help us move on). I'm also <br>tempted to link to two-year old posts so some of you <br>new folks can see what all the fuss is about, and that <br>Hrant has come a long way, but the archives have saved <br>me the effort and spared us all the past. A past that <br>hopefully we can all laugh about later. <br> <br>Lastly, I won't speak as a moderator/partner here. It's <br>just me. Hrant hasn't asked for this thread, nor does <br>he deserve more air time (or scolding for that matter), <br>but in so many ways he has been asking for it for a <br>very long time and rightfully deserves a lengthy public <br>scolding in the form of a roast from someone who likes <br>to think he cares. <br> <br>I could just second most of what Jon Coltz and all of <br>what John Hudson wrote and sit down. I could just agree <br>with anonymous, that Hrant is a tedious, insufferable <br>bigot. I do think I have a different perspective to <br>offer and hopefully it can be taken constructively by <br>Hrant and his detractors. (Besides, John's British <br>roots betrayed him; he was way too polite for Hrant to <br>actually see the critique. =) <br> <br>I'll be as blunt as Hrant seems to prefer and I'm going <br>to try to be candid and also fair. Hrant needs to <br>change, frankly in ways I'm skeptical are possible. The <br>Type community, including myself, needs to change: to <br>consider Hrant for what he is now, and move on. The <br>only caveat is, I've never met him. I don't read every <br>single post here (or elsewhere) so I don't consider <br>myself privy to everything he says or did in his past <br>life. <br> <br>On to the letter. <br> <br>_________________________ <br> <br>Jon, <br> <br>In some ways I agree. In other ways Hrant angers me <br>beyond words. Thanks for giving me a platform for my <br>vent and call to action. <br> <br>I've heard too many people, whom I respect and whose <br>experience I would love to hear from more, say he's the <br>reason they don't post more. That's a shame. <br> <br>But I believe he's becoming sufficiently *ignorable for <br>those who find him insufferable. (I'll elaborate <br>later.) <br> <br>Like Yves, I too believe Hrant's not a bad guy, I know <br>he's had a legal run-in with a major foundry in the <br>past which, to my 3rd-hand knowledge is resolved and <br>forgiven by all parties (if I'm wrong someone will <br>correct me within the hour) and is deeper than being <br>removed from any online discussion, but not so deep <br>that the type community should hang him out to dry. I <br>don't fully know the details, nor should we care, <br>unless they are pertinent or threatening or affect us <br>personally. I even believe, if one are sincere and <br>Hrant sensed that sincerity, he'd probably tell about <br>it. Finally, from what I can tell, Hrant never holds a <br>grudge. Okay, so I shouldn't say never, but at least <br>when he holds a grudge you'll know about it. For these <br>reasons I no longer question his motives, only his <br>approach. <br> <br><b>That's the past baggage,</b> that's Hrant pre 2001-2002 <br>(I sincerely hope). Let's move on already and hope <br>Hrant can help us tolerate him more with my <br>Simple-Action Reckoning and Carefree Approach to <br>Symbiosis Method outlined below. <br> <br><b>On to the present baggage.</b> Yes, this is for those <br>of you intolerant of hhp. He's become more ignorable in <br>the past year. He's more willing to admit wrong or <br>listen to another view. Sometimes, though, when I can't <br>bear it, I still have to post <i>around</i> Hrant by <br>picking up a thread at a point before he got to it. For <br>the most part this works, but honestly, Hrant is a <br>better man than some of you grudgingly hold. Even <br>though he's still an insufferable tedious bigot. <br> <br><b>Mr. Papazian's online wanderings would be more <br>fruitful to him and others if he found better focus.</b> <br>Were his postings more targeted and less haphazard he <br>could focus on mutual understanding and less time <br>responding to every thread, everywhere. (Does Hrant go <br>home at night and check off a list off all the <br>perceived wrongs he righted?) <br> <br>Seriously, Hrant should use his online time (is he ever <br>off-line?) to pick a few key discussions and really <br>explore them, rather than his current method of reading <br>every thread and taking a shotgun-blast approach to <br>leaving quick comments in each one. When Hrant agrees <br>with a thread, these quick comments are cheapened by <br>their quantity like showering too many compliments. <br>However, when he disagrees, these quick comments come <br>off as blanket statements wherein he endicts entire <br>industries, classes of people, organizations and entire <br>nations. They are antagonizing and, by their quick <br>nature, unproductive and take away from the times when <br>he's caught being helpful or kind. <br> <br><b>Hrant has to help us like him better.</b> In your <br>letter Jon, you assert that others don't post because <br>they're afraid. That may be so, for a minority. Most <br>just see that it's fruitless to engage in a <br>conversation with someone who just wants to antagonize; <br>someone who just argues, and seemingly not for the sake <br>of disagreement, but for the savor of being <br>disagreeable. If that keeps someone with real-world <br>experience -- as opposed to being well read or even the <br>most verbose -- away from online forums, that's a <br>shame. (Unfortunately the 'fruitful avoidance' thing <br>only seems to work in hallways and lecture halls.) <br> <br>This isn't the 4th grade where we get an S if we play <br>nicely or a U if we don't. Unfortunately, in the past, <br>Hrant has given people plenty of reasons to not like <br>him. Some people just want more reasons to like Hrant. <br>Some of these will never be satisfied and that's okay, <br>and it's probably okay with Hrant too. Afterall, he's <br>never sought anybody's approval. <br> <br>I already responded to Hrant's comment about tolerance. <br>I'll elaborate since it suits the structure of my <br>letter. On August 11, 9:25am, he wrote: <br> <br><i>We come from different environments, and <br>naturally civility has different measures for you and <br>me... The only thing you should try to enforce is <br>tolerance... It really is a matter of spine, which <br>translates to self-control. </i> <br> <br>Even though Hrant can be insulting, he may be the most <br>tolerant of us as people. Afterall, he chooses to live <br>in America, a land he loathes, among mostly Christians <br>who he deems worse than nazis, in LA of all places, the <br>ideological capital of all things decadent, fat and <br>SUV-driving. Phew, now that's tolerant! <br> <br>He's certainly not the most tolerant of ideas, however. <br>His tolerance argument sounds good if it's coming from <br>Mr. Bowfry (ahem, back in the 4th grade). If Hrant were <br>the picked-on kid who was always nice, but still had no <br>friends, we'd be inclined to agree with his view of <br>tolerance and have empathy. Or at least, he'd be a <br>chick magnet with the 6th grade girls.) <br> <br>I'm not sure if I should congratulate Hrant on growing <br>a stiff spine or if I should challenge him to now grow <br>some manners ('Western' or what he calls'traditional' <br>I'd take either one. He is essentially saying, "if you <br>can't tolerate my abrasiveness, then you're intolerant, <br>and that's your fault, not mine." That's Hrant's excuse <br>for not taking the time or effort to articulate what <br>he's thinking. Honesty doesn't have to be rude and <br>blunt is not the same as brash. If Hrant were really <br>trying to have a conversation or productive dialogue <br>he'd strive to communicate and be understood rather <br>than aiming to offend. <br> <br>Now I'll try to tone down my digs -- some friendly, all <br>critical. Truthfully, when he takes the effort to stay <br>through an argument, the harsh points, the brazen <br>attitude and caustic shards are broken off in the <br>tussle and the result is a mishappen but recognizalbe <br>nugget that many seem to agree on. The journey is <br>sometimes longer than its worth, but once tested, there <br>is a semi-rational person behind the hhp signature. <br>(Okay, despite my own social/political/religious and <br>sometimes typographic views.) <br> <br>In conclusion, here's my four step <b>Simple-Action Reckoning and <br>Carefree Approach to Symbiosis Method</b> or <br><b>S.A.R.C.A.S.M.</b>: (Hrant, this is the part you can <br>easily copy and paste into your reply.) <br> <br><b>1)</b> Limit your posts to one or two threads on one or two <br>forums per week. Oh, and take a weekend off every once <br>in a while. Doing this will help you be more focused, <br>more meaningful, more understood and those who can't <br>stand you will have less of you to 'tolerate.' Oh, plus <br>it will help us all keep up. <br> <br><b>2)</b> Offer your strongest opinions when you have have <br>some expertise or real experience, not just because you <br>have a strong opinion. (We're all entitled to our <br>opinions, but we're not all prepared to hear the all <br>the uninformed ones all the time. This is why I'm <br>silent a lot. It helps me stay mysterious and looking <br>smarter than I am. Why do you think Jared is quieter <br>than me? You probably also thought he was smarter than <br>me. =) <br> <br><b>3)</b> When you don't have an interest/expertise in a topic <br>try listening. (I remember when you once held the <br>opinion that letterpress was a useless exercise in <br>nostalgia. Now that you've taken a class in it you've <br>developed a new opinion and I've enjoyed listening to <br>you talk about it. (And Geralds, I haven't pushed any <br>ems, if letterpress is the only measure we're using <br>here, I guess I'm out.) <br> <br>Finally, the failsafe in the Simple-Action Reckoning <br>and Carefree Approach to Symbiosis Method is: <br> <br><b>4)</b> If none of these works, start a blog at your own <br>domain and say whatever you please. We'll come and <br>listen at our leisure and you can stay on or divert any <br>topics you choose or bait your chocolate and eat it too <br>for all we care. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>Joseph Pemberton <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>PS -- If you don't do something about this Hrant <br>Papazian -- I mean if his opinions go unchecked -- <br>the Google archives 45 years from now will show that <br>hhp was the premier type guy of the 21st century. Now <br>that's a scary thought. It's true. Google tracks sheer <br>quantity not quality folks. <br> <br> <br>* No, not ignoble, ignorable. Just in case you may have <br>read that wrong.</div>

<div class=commentbody>David, <br> <br>It's from Cicero's first Catalinarian oration (63 BC, I believe). Cataline, a senator, was conspiring to overthrow the government, and part of his plan involved an attempt to assassinate Cicero. The night after the failed attempt, Cicero accosted Cataline in the Senate, and in the presence of all, he asked, "To what end, Cataline (insert favorite list poster here), will you abuse our patience?" <br> <br>Cicero subsequently had Cataline murdered. <br> <br>Jon</div>

<div class=commentbody>Joseph Pemberton, <br> <br>3) When you don't have an interest/expertise in a topic try listening. (I remember when you once held the opinion that letterpress was a useless exercise in nostalgia. Now that you've taken a class in it you've developed a new opinion and I've enjoyed listening to you talk about it. (And Geralds, I haven't pushed any ems, if letterpress is the only measure we're using here, I guess I'm out.) <br>...... <br> <br>I am not one wishing to dampen enthusiasm about letterpress including Hrants, but the point is more than quantity of ems per hour. But of expertise. My serious qualifications as a punchcutter, typefounder grant me a greater credibility of how type is made. Would you not think that could be true? My observations about Pascal has nothing to do with nostalgia. That is what I was accused of, not knowing what I was talking about, and nostalgia apparently negated any knowledge that I may have accumulated. I think not. <br> <br>Together Hrant and Gerald Lange intended to insult me in public and I take it as such. <br> <br>Also, I did not say that Gerald Lange did bad work. If I thought so, certainly that was my opportunity. My opinion is the very opposite. <br> <br>But as far as, "not doing bad work", neither do I. <br> <br>Maybe I should have made myself more clear. <br> <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/ATF.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/ATF.html</a> <br>Read down column. <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br>Lanston Type Company. <br> <br></div>

The example you give is phrased as a personal attack because you aledge personal failings in the person involved. You can make the same point about the substance of the debate without getting personal. <br> <br>For example, you could say, "Taking calligraphy as a model rules out valuable improvements such as trapping." I don't know what you meant to say on the substance, but if you have a point to make about the type design issue, it is always in principle possible to do it without getting personal. (Assuming of course it is not a personal issue to start with, such as piracy.)

<div class=commentbody>Keep living with your cozy formal separation of people's character and their actions, their contribution to culture, and you'll keep missing the big picture, the <i>cause</i> of things. Saying something like "taking calligraphy as a model rules out valuable improvements such as trapping" strips out the invaluable insight into the entire foundation of that person's (misguided, to me) oeuvre. Such tentativeness can only produce obvious insights, stuff nobody needs you for. Your very stance here is not some abstract formal reality, it's coming directly from inside you. <br> <br>All you're really talking about is a particular set of social norms, which you conveniently cast as the The Right Way. That doesn't fly with me, and it flies in inverse proportion to the diversity within a given group of people. Just be happy I'm not interested in preaching my social mores to you - you wouldn't hear the end of it. <br> <br>If you want to have a separation, start at home: instead of promulgating your personal religion, talk about type. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Regarding Sokrates' death, a classicist friend pointed out that drinking hemlock was not a normal form of execution in Athens, and that it was probably prescribed in Sokrates' sentence because of his involvement with the 30 Tyrants, who <i>had</i> used that form of execution. In other words, the method of execution tells us something about the political reasons for Sokrates' trial. Not only did he annoy a lot of people, he had also backed a highly unpopular dictatorial regime.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the way Hrant does. Of course it can be desapointing or, even, hurting. But i don't see the point of the people who are angry because Hrant says things they're supposed to master are wrong or so. If these persons trusts themselves enough to say they're masters in their domain, why would they care about the opinion of any Hrant ? <br>It's the same with personal attacks, if people are deeply hurt, they haven't understand the way internet works, or/and give really too much importance to what people they don't even know, say. <br>I can see myself or anybody else being hurt by a mean critic on his work. But that's not what Hrant does, and as another person has mentionned, he's not mean when it comes to work criticism (mean appearing to me not to fit to any of Hrant comments, anyway). <br>If i had something to had, it would be that Hrant is a very good rhetorician (sorry for spelling), in the good way. He nearly convinced me that we need a king and that boumas was the ultimate type theory, when i'm the average relativist he'd hate</div>

<div class=commentbody>>It's the same with personal attacks, if people are deeply hurt, they haven't understand the way internet works <br> <br>You may be right that the personal attacks are an unavoidable feature of the internet. With the other person being just ASCII and not a physical presence or even voice, people (me included) tend to lose the normal restraints of civility. <br> <br>But I for one am saddened by it. The new communities that the internet has made possible, such as this one, I think are a beautiful thing. The occasional - or frequent - rudeness of some posters is an ugly scar on this beautiful new creation. <br> <br>If the posters on this board could as a rule take special care not to give into the temptation to be rude, and to resist answering rudeness with rudness, it might change the culture on this board. <br> <br>But as you indicate, and by the evidence of this thread, this is probably a vain hope. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>William, <br> <br>Your words I agree with. <br> <br>"If the posters on this board could as a rule take special care not to give into the temptation to be rude, and to resist answering rudeness with rudness, it might change the culture on this board." <br> <br>..... <br> <br>I have found myself guilty of this myself. <br> <br>In another thread, I responded with rudeness to rudeness bringing me down to his level. I don't mean Hrant either. I followed up with a more progressive posting. I am sure that both of us have regrets. <br> <br>So I will try to work on that. It is not a feature, it is a fault. <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br>P.S. I still like funny. <br> <br></div>

I'm usually not <br>that way, I think people can attest that. It just <br>enrages me that those anonymous posters <br>seemingly get away with poisoning threads and <br>insulting people behind their anonimosity. And <br>I'm convinced that most of my co-Typophiles feel <br>exactly the same way.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Like I said, it's all about you. <br> <br>> it might change the culture on this board. <br> <br>To your liking. <br>Since Typophile membership has doubled in the past year or so, I'd say the culture is doing well enough, and there's reason to believe that <i>candor</i> is one reason for that. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Regarding anonymity: <br>The <i>General Discussions</i> and <i>Type Identification Board</i> <br>are the only areas that allow anonymous posting. If it's time <br>to change that, voice your opinion <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6294.html>here</a>. <br> <br>Regarding civility: <br>William, I wholeheartedly agree about restraint. And Gerald, <br>I'm glad you've chosen to stick around, despite your first <br>bad experience here. If there's an underlying tone to this <br>thread, I hope it's that we can all move on, past the <br>perceived wrongdoings of the past and consider people for <br>what they are offering to the community now. <br> <br>But I will say that, on the whole, this board is more civil <br>than any other I'm aware of.</div>
