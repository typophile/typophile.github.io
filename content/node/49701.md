body: "Hello everybody!\r\n\r\nI happened upon this old lead typeface recently (see
  attach). Its name is \"Industria\", and it was designed by Hermann Zehnpfundt for
  the Emil Gursch Foundry in Berlin in 1910/1913; Berthold later added a couple of
  weights in the 1920s. The most recent sample I have been able to find so far dates
  from 1933.\r\n\r\nSo far, not too much to ID, but: Has anybody seen this typeface
  digitised, or anything that looks more or less closely inspired by it? I already
  asked on the German <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typoforum/index.php\">typoforum</a>,
  where nobody had seen it, but I figured if anyone knows at all, then probably here.\r\n\r\nI'm
  kind of hoping you'll say no, since I'm inclined at having a go myself. I really
  like this one. :)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need / want more images. This
  is the base weight, I have also found specimens of the light, semibold, and bold
  weights.\r\n\r\nThanks for any pointers!\r\nNina\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/industria_small_5469.gif]"

  body: "Thanks, Florian! Indeed it is kind of reminiscent of the overall shapes;
    I think this one is special also with regard to what Erkki called the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/38174\">\"special
    retro grotesk vibe\"</a> :-), which especially shows itself in characteristic
    letters such as the a, g, and \xDF."
