  and couldn&#39;t find it - so I thought I&#39;d ask again... <BR> <BR>It&#39;s being
  used a lot lately so I figure somebody&#39;s got it somewheres... <BR><a href="http://www.vondutch.com"

  body: If you are interested in the VonDutch logo, I don&#39;t think it is a font.
    At least, the interlaced swashes have to be done by hand. Can you show us somewhere
    else you have seen it used, if you say it&#39;s being used a lot lately? <BR>
    <BR>A search of our past threads didn&#39;t show &#39;Von Dutch&#39; ever as a
    topic, by the way.

  body: Hey guys - yeah I&#39;m trying to find out if the &#34;Von Dutch&#34; letters
    can be found as a font anywhere...here&#39;s some samples of where I&#39;ve seen
    it used... <BR>check out the 3rd row of shirts here <BR><a href="http://www.kerusso.com/NewDesigns.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.kerusso.com/NewDesigns.htm</a> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also
    seen it on a &#34;Myrtle Beach&#34; shirt but I can&#39;t seem to find a pic of
    it - if I do I will post it... <BR>

  body: I&#39;m sticking with the idea that this is custom lettering. The fact that
    both other samples have ended in &#39;h&#39; and presumably have the same swash
    underlining the words, suggests imitation as much as the possibility of a font.
    <BR>The &#39;His Death&#39; shirts aren&#39;t clear enough to see whether the
    lettering is identical or just similar to the Von Dutch lettering.

  body: The letter shapes on the &#34;<a href="http://www.kerusso.com/graphics/Apparel/Adult%20T-Shirts/Large%20Images/APTHDN.jpg">His
    Death</a>&#34; shirts are clearly different; I agree with Mike that the shirts
    you mentioned are probably an imitation of the Von Dutch logotype.

  body: ok - so we&#39;re going with a &#34;custom lettering&#34; verdict here? I
    figured that&#39;s what it was and the other &#34;imitation&#34; or &#34;parody&#34;
    shirts and just more custom jobs done to look &#34;von dutch-ish&#34;... that&#39;s
    cool - I just thought I&#39;d check to see if anybody had possibly made a &#34;look-a-like-famous-font&#34;
    for it yet or not... <BR> <BR>wow i used a lot of &#34;quotes&#34; <BR>so thanks
    for the help guys - any come across a look-a-like font please let me know <BR>
    <BR>&#34;thanks - tom&#34;
