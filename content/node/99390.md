  have finished the basic design of Shket and I'm looking for testers and critique.
  I'm specially interested in checking glyphs and diacritics for not so common (for
  me at least) languages as Swedish, Norwegian and so on. The font currently has 406
  glyphs including cyrillic alphabet.\r\n\r\nRegards!\r\n\r\nDownload link: http://www.sendspace.com/file/5gdess"

    Font Viewer and MS Word.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I'd suggest you moving this from
    the blog section to the critique forum, which tends to be much more interactive.\r\n\r\n

    report! I guess it's a hinting related problem?"

  body: "Not hinting at all.  It has to do with the metric data, and ascenders and
    descenders. I'm guessing that you've only tested it with Adobe products. I see
    that the Win Descent entry is zero. Fixing that (or letting FontLab set the metrics
    automatically) solved that problem here.\r\n\r\nThis site has an excellent article
    (in pdf form) about setting metrics:\r\n   http://kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.shtml\r\n\r\nAgain,
    blogs are rarely used here (look at the posting dates) and don't show up easily
    in Typophile's pages - most people go straight to the Forums.  If you move (or
    copy) this topic to the Critique forum, you'll get much more and better responses.
    I just happened to find your original post because I was aimlessly browsing; and
    found your response only because it showed up under \"My posts\" because I had
    posted to this topic.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "That is what I thought HVB. I have read about hinting in the FL manual, but
    the truth is I haven't done any hinting yet. I'm on a Mac environment and yes,
    only tested with Adobe products.\r\n\r\nAs I'm in an very early stage of the font
    development (working version 0.15) I'm currently more interested in metrics, overall
    typefaces design, diacritics, punctuation marks and so on. I guess hinting and
    the more complex stuff can wait while I have not finished the font \"basics\".\r\n\r\nThere
    is a topic about this font in the Critique forum http://typophile.com/node/99329\r\nNobody
    has written in there yet though... I guess the typeface is too \"boring and simple\"
    to be worth discussing (\r\n\r\nRegards!"
