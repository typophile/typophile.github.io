body: Why is there a scroll bar on the home page of Typophile? I am using Safari,
  does this GUI cause a scroll bar to have to be used on the main page? Maybe this
  is a really stupid question, I hope not. Let me know.

  body: The only reason there'd be a scroll bar, which I can reckon, is that your
    browser window isn't opened wide enough.

  body: Yeah, that is what I thought at first, but my browser window is open as wide
    as my screen will allow!

    T says, your browser is shorter than the contents of the page.\r\n\r\nIf you are
    referring to the 3 boxes in the middle, those are designed to have scrollbars
    and were built in flash."
