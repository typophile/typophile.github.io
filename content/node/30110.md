body: "I\u2019m curious to see what typefaces people are using in their daily startup
  sets. I know it\u2019s more interesting to take the time and experiment with different
  fonts for each new design project, but for many reasons, (time, budget etc.) one
  must rely on the tried and true methods of efficiency. I know many of these daily
  sets are directly applicable to the industries and clients we serve, but I\u2019d
  be very interested to see what others are doing. I\u2019ll start. Here is a sampling
  of what my daily set includes:\r\nAachen\r\nAkzidenz Grotesk\r\nAldus\r\nBembo\r\nFrutiger\r\nGill
  Sans\r\nMachine\r\nMyriad\r\nPerpetua\r\nPopplLaudatio\r\nUnivers\r\n"

    for awhile. It really depends on what I'm working on.\r\n\r\nI tend to keep Gotham
    open, tho, along with Thesis and Today Sans and for serifs my fallbacks lately
    are Adobe Garamond and Filosofia.\r\n\r\nBut I've got a bunch of stuff open right
    now from Tribute to Meta to Klavika, Caecilia, Requiem, Jigsaw, Dalliance, Abadi,
    and some weird agitated scripts I was looking at for a book cover."
