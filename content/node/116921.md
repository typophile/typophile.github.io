  found this font and I love the numbers on it, especially the 1. It looks a lot like
  both Silvertone Woodtype and Dharma Gothic, but not exactly like either. Check out
  the 5. For more examples, here's the page I got the first image from, with a second
  image: <a href=\"http://visitindy.com/indy-accolades\">here</a> And here's another
  advertisement that uses the exact same font, I think: <a href=\"https://www.aggielandoutfitters.com/media/wysiwyg/GREGHILL.jpg\">here</a>"
