  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>[[Indices]] : [[Designers]] : Johann Gutenberg</strong>

A man of mystery. Sadly, very little is known about him. His real name was probably <strong>Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden</strong>, but he most likely went by a series of nicknames, such as "Henchen" or "Elle". "Gutenberg" was the name of one of his family's houses within the city of [[Mainz]], [[Germany]].

Born into an aristocratic family, Gutenberg was not an aristocrat himself (his father married a commoner). It is not known when Gutenberg was born. Around [[1900]], the city of Mainz decreed his birthdate to have fallen in June [[1400]], allowing them to throw a big summer party in his honor. Gutenberg died in [[1468]] in Eltville, up the Rhein from Mainz.

As a young man, Gutenberg left Mainz for Strasbourg, in present-day [[France]]. Sometime before [[1450]], he moved back home. Gutenberg  worked as a goldsmith and became skilled in the casting of finite amounts of metal. Either in Strasbourg or Mainz, between ca. [[1440]] and [[1450]], Gutenberg invented the idea of printing with movable [[type]] in the west. He invented a way to cast individual letters cheaply, and also a means to [[printing|print]] them (an probably the [[ink]] used, too!).

His first printed work was a Latin grammar. Later, he borrowed money to begin work on the first of a series of Bibles, the B42 (or 42-line Bible). He also printed indulgences, and a sort of proto-encyclopedia.

These major works were printed in Mainz, even if printing was not "invented" there. Gutenberg also had a studio in [[Frankfurt]] during his busiest years, were he farmed out some of the production work.

Around the year [[2000]], Gutenberg was voted "Man of the Millenium" by an international panel of scientists.

There is a comprehensive [[Gutenberg Museum]] in Mainz, which has three original Gutenberg Bibles in its collection.
