  Italic or Worldwide Italic. However, the \"k\" and the \"r\" are not the same. Is
  there a similar one it could be?\r\n\r\nThere's a picture below, and more pictures
  of the font with additional letters at this Pinterest board: http://www.pinterest.com/realsimple/daily-thoughts-inspiration/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simplyfont_4273.jpg]\r\n"
