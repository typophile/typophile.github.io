body: "<strong>[[Indices]]: [[Designers]]: Grant Hutchinson</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Grant
  Hutchinson</strong> (b. 1963) has been designing, manipulating and marketing digital
  type for years. On the way to his previous gig at [[Veer]], he created typefaces
  and helped keep the storefronts tidy at visual content purveyors such as [[Image
  Club]], Adobe Studios, EyeWire, and Getty Images.\r\n\r\nHe founded [[Typostrophe]]
  in 2009 as a home base for his ongoing typographic concerns.\r\n\r\nGrant resides
  in Calgary, Alberta \u2014 along with a basement full of vintage computers and typographic
  paraphernalia that his wife wishes he would store somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe occupies
  what little spare time is left over at the end of the day by blathering on about
  stuff on <a href=\"http://splorp.com/\">his website</a>, photographing the <a href=\"http://flickr.com/splorp/\">mundane
  and weathered</a> and running <a href=\"http://newtontalk.net/\">several</a> <a
  href=\"http://newted.org/\">community</a> <a href=\"http://npds.info/\">sites</a>
  dedicated to the support of obsolete (but dearly loved) handheld computing platforms.
  He has also been known to contribute sporadically to [[Typographica]].\r\n\r\nTypefaces
  by Grant include: <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?7K7\">Badloc</a>, <a
  href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?7P9\">Boca Raton</a>, <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?7TA\">Broadband</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?7YX\">Carver</a> (with [[Noel Rubin]]),
  <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?82F\">East Bloc</a>, <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?8GZ\">Narrowband</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?8LC\">New Geneva Nine</a>, and the Schmutz
  family (<a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?8DG\">Cleaned</a>, <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?8SQ\">Clogged</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?8SR\">Corroded</a>)\r\n\r\nHe still gets
  misty-eyed recalling the hours he spent hunched over sheets of dry-transfer lettering,
  painstakingly ad libbing uppercase As from inverted Vs and hyphens."
