  with a similar 'a'.\r\nSince I can't buy single weights of Parisine, it's too expensive
  for what I need it for. So, consequentially, the alternative has to allow the purchase
  of single weights.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated."

    option. \r\n\r\nFoundry Sterling too is sort of similar.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "hey Florian,\r\nThanks. A set of good suggestions. FF Milo seems to be a
    useful alternative. Fresco Sans already crossed my mind, and is one of my favorite
    sans serifs. \r\nI think one of those two will work.\r\n\r\nArun: \r\nGood suggestion,
    I already checked it out. Unfortunately no individual weights. :("
