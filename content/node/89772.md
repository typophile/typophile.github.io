  body: "Either way, my guess is that this was designed to be manufacturable. With
    more samples it might be possible to identify a typeface that could have been
    the baseline used to design these letters, but then again, the letter shapes (especially
    the serifs) may have been designed for producibility rather than fidelity to a
    known typeface.  It's just my impression, but the C seems narrower than I would
    expect given the O.\r\n\r\nBased on your question, I assumed you were trying the
    ID the typeface, but if you were just wondering if these were stock letters by
    someone who did signage, or custom letters for the specific job, my guess is that
    this sign maker had a set of molds for an alphabet and cast the letters needed
    for the signs. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    shown in the Guide sample nonsense name, but are not Key letters you can select
