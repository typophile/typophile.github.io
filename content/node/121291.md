  font license covers use of fonts in PC games? I've tried using their help system
  to find out directly but it seems its not possible to contact Adobe unless you either
  buy a product or pay for support and I don't have access to either directly at work.\r\n\r\nIn
  my experience font foundries always require a special license for use of fonts in
  games. However I've been told that Adobe's standard font license covers use in games
  and I'd like to confirm this. I very much doubt its true but does anyone know for
  a fact?\r\n\r\nThanks everyone."

  body: "Thanks for the fast reply. I got a reply from Adobe. The font we want to
    use is licensed by Monotype and they say we should contact them directly. However
    they were able to confirm that their standard license does not cover the use of
    fonts in games as I thought.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to get out of using Adobe fonts
    and want to be able to choose fonts from other foundries but we're being told
    we have a license from Adobe that covers us. Hence the question.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for taking the time to answer."

    Their standard license doesn't include use for games as you'd expect. I had to
    ask though because we were being told it did by another party.\r\n\r\nYou have
    to contact them directly and request a quote for use in games. Why there is no
    transparent pricing policy is beyond me, fonts in games must be a common request
    and it all seems a bit opportunist of the big font foundries to me."

    because the font or a derivative is included with the game itself, and most foundries
    will charge for redistribution based on the projected distribution of the product,
    so a lower fee for an indy game vs a font for say Halo or Madden.\r\n"
