  website]] went through a major overhaul recently, and their large homepage ads feature
  an elegant, geometric, light-weight (slab serif?) font that I simply adore. Below
  is a screencap of one of the ads for convenience. I thought it might be [[http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/134|Inlove]]
  by Sudtipos, or a modification thereof, but now I'm not sure. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts
  are appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCodi\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/istock_type_4939.gif]"

  body: "<cite>why aren't you sure?</cite>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure because I don't trust
    my font identification skills until proven correct by outside sources. And, I'm
    pretty good at talking myself into believing something one minute, then talking
    myself out of believing it the next. \r\n\r\nAfter taking an even closer look
    at the character set, perhaps my initial assumption was correct indeed."
