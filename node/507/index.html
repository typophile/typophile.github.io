		<div class="commentbody">I'm going to slightly disagree here and admit that I actually LIKE Helvetica. (GASP!) <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> I mean the font, not most uses of it. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, it's become so commonplace and so accessible that it's very often ruthlessly abused by unskilled hands. <BR> <BR>Computers have aided and abetted this trend, but it was true even before the days of desktop publishing. Helvetica began suffering its vicious cycle of abuse in the '60s and '70s, as &quot;generic&quot; became a trendy design thing. <BR> <BR>In my opinion, Helvetica (whether the original or the &quot;Neue&quot; series) is at its most beautiful when used as a display font (perhaps the way some woodcut faces would be used), taking advantage of its range of weights and widths as well as its graceful and more subtle shapes. It should be incorporated into the design, rather than simply plastered mercilessly across a page like so much eggshell latex semi-gloss paint. The IRS and Adobe Acrobat will spend decades in Purgatory for their crimes against Helvetica. <BR> <BR>Don't malign the font just because 99% of its users are abusing it. Hasn't it been through enough pain? After all, this plain &quot;generic&quot; font became as popular as it is (before computers) for a reason. <BR> <BR>Arial can't claim this. It was hacked out, mass-marketed and force-fed to hapless computer consumers. <BR> <BR>A few moments spent flipping through any preferred design annual or an issue of &quot;Graphis&quot; proves how stunningly Helvetica can be used, in the right hands. <BR> <BR>David <BR>(Helvetica sympathizer)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, I disagree with the &quot;S&quot;, I've heard many people saying that they find it one of the most beautiful characters in a typeface.

		<div class="commentbody">My recollection about the Licko effort that Ole mentioned is that this was Zuzana's contribution to an article in one of the design magazines a couple years back. I thought it was <I>Critique</I> &ndash; but I couldn't find the article in my collection, so perhaps it was another.  <BR> <BR>If I remember correctly, the magazine asked several designers to revamp a logo or a design. Zuzana was asked to update Helvetica. In her response, I think she said that she didn't feel that Helvetica should be redesigned, but that it could benefit from a true italic and so that's what she contributed. <BR> <BR>I don't think the project was ever meant as anything more than an exercise. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I used to cringe at Avant Garde Gothic too, but these days I view it more as an interesting experiment in geometric sanserifs and ligatures. You must admit, it does have a wide array of innovative ligatures. Unfortunately, these aren't included with most digital cuts of the face. <BR> <BR>The fact that Avant Garde Gothic looks terribly dated today may have more to do with its overuse (much like the much-maligned Helvetica) than with its intrinsic design. When it is used well (and, admittedly, that is an extremely rare occurrence) it can shine. <BR> <BR>Like Helvetica, it is at its strongest when used as a display font rather than a text face. <BR> <BR>Having said that, however, I also should admit that I rarely (if ever) use it. <BR> <BR>I can, however, envision a day (perhaps in the far-flung future :D ) when it might become fashionable again. After all, who would have thought that woodcut fonts would have ever returned to a state of vogue? Yet they have, several times, and they still pop up in stunning design even today. Again, it's all in how they are used. <BR> <BR>David <BR>(Seemingly becoming a homely font sympathizer in general) <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">iota, the popularity of helvetica stems way beyond the fact that a flash in the pan group (who i do in fact love) like the designers republic use of it. it even goes further then the fact that it is just a great all around face. it's popularity stems from the fact that postmodernism has eaten itself alive and returned to it's roots in modernism. the modernist aesthetic is alive and kicking again because of postmodernism. how ironic it is but then again it can be expected from a movement as ironic as postmodernism. because helvetica rose to the forefront of the modernist movement it has become a shoe in as far as the retro mimicry of postmodernism is concerned. but it's the fact that it is such a great face that people have fallen in love with it again.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">keith, i think avant garde has too much character and is much too geometric. i don't really put helvetica into that same category as avant garde. i think avant garde is more of a display than anything else. you could never set copy in it. univers on the other hand is just not a very handsome face. i've seen many of my contemporaries at art center come over to the darkside on the univers/helvetica issue. univers is just too organic in it's letterforms. i'd rather use akzidenz or even frutiger over univers. helvetica is more ridged than universe that's obvious but why use a half breed face like universe that doesn't do a good job of being either geometric or humanist.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As primarily a writer and reader, and secondarily a typofile, I emphatically agree with those who say that Helvetica is a rotten text face.  <BR> <BR>A whole page of Helvetica, especially set wide, is an actual pain to read. I want to kick the person who designed the page whenever I see such a horror. <BR> <BR>I really think this is something that can be settled by testing. If you set a page in Helvetica and in, say Adobe Caslon or any of the classic serif types, and ask people I bet you you will get an overwhelming majority of people who say that the Helvetica is harder to read.  <BR> <BR>The merits of Helvetica as a display face are a matter of taste, but as a text face I think that those who say it is readible are radically and provably wrong, wrong, wrong.  <BR> <BR>After years of cursing pages - especially letter sized - with Helvetica I thought that no sans could be even decent for extended text. I was astonished by the PDF of Vesta at GerardUnger.com, which is quite readable.  <BR> <BR>The Humanist sans generally are much better in readibility - Bliss is my favorite for its elegance, but I still can't see the point of using a sans for extended text. They have a lot of other good uses, of course.     <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">No matter what we do we're living in a post-modern world. The beauty of it is we agree on disagreeing. No matter how 'Modernist' a piece of work might be, we won't be seeing it under the same light as our predecessors, because our world is not the same any more. So, a so-called 'Modernist' piece of design is simply a 'style' we pick from the 'big closet' in order to sell something to a particular group of 'target audience', who happen to be hip and cool and trendy yuppies. The same goes for 'traditionalist' designs. <BR> <BR>I think we not only live in a post-modern world, we also live in a multicultural world (at least in this part of the world). That even renders so-called 'movements' like Post-modernism and/or Modernism at best redundant, or at worst, meaningless. It's time to lose the 'isms' and focus more on what we are supposed to do: to communicate visually. As long as we keep our goal in mind, and to continue to be passionate about what it is that we're doing, then we'll be alright. <BR> <BR>I have two opposing views about typography: one of which is that typography is first and foremost about communicating the textual content as efficiently as possible; the other is utilizing the semantics of type to give design work particular 'atmospheres' or emotional responses. The first one is based on linguistic requirements and it's what 'traditional' (book) typography was (is) all about. The latter is based on visual requirements, which is what graphic design is about, mostly. Of course, these two views are not mutually exclusive and it is up to us to strike a balance between the two.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; last time i checked&hellip; <BR> <BR>I wouldn't begrudge you having Art Center in the Top Ten or even the top 3 or 2. But saying any school is the top, tippy tippy top, is wrong. Maybe it was the top school for you to attend. But it wouldn't have offered me the education I would have wanted. Great education is only the sum of its parts, ergo great students and great teachers. I sincerely believe this. Students have to be absorbing, Teachers have to be imparting good/correct information and from this comes a good education. Therefore I don't think it is so easy to say that this school or that school is the best. Good Students + Good Teachers = Good Education.  <BR> <BR>How much trouble will this get me into today?  <BR> <BR>I've seen what can happen when bad teachers (that don't care, or have given up) get a hold of good students (with their own drive and motivation). I've seen those students continue on and succeed in spite of their lopsided education. I've also seen good teachers (with the information needed and desire to impart it) attempt to work with students (who don't care or worse think there talent will save them at the eleventh hour). And I've also seen good teachers and good students and the education that has come of that. <BR> <BR>[ Thanks Jay. I really want to spout off about this :^) ] <BR> <BR>Sorry to all. I created another off-topic problem. <BR> <BR>Jay, you are right about the capitalist world in which we live. However, I still think you are wrong. And also, you are right that Art Center's pricing is out of whack. Way out of whack. <BR> <BR>And another thing, Jay, it isn't nice to resort to name calling in place of a well-written and well-informed thought. I think William's train of thinking is correct about the &quot;testing&quot;.   <BR> <BR>But again, we are so far off-topic. Oops, my bad. <BR> <BR>&gt; trying to make art into science is missing the boat. <BR> <BR>but we aren't discussing art, we are discussing design. Saying that we are discussing art would allow everyone's interpretation to be correct. (Devil's Adovcate)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">oh no, here we go&hellip; the whole what's good for the whole might not be good for the individual. you must understand i'm not arguing this. you might be into some strange cult that worships a donkey so then it would make sense that a program that offered graphic design and donkey worship might be best for you. it wouldn't matter that the program might be bottom of the barrel and backwards but it's what the individual thinks is best for themselves. what i'm saying is that's not the case. there is truth to generalities. the type of generalities that say for instance that art center is one of the best schools in the world. without this there is no way you can even come into a forum like this and discus anything subjective let alone type. i just don't jive with that sort of thinking. there is a point to human classification and rankings. that is why they exist. that is why we are here talking about such topics as typography. <BR> <BR>i agree with you on the art vs. design thing. i don't really want to open that one up. my point is though that we are talking about something that is highly subjective and in the area of craft boarders on art. i think we all know it will never be. but it is most certainly not science. <BR> <BR>i'm glad i gave you the form to spout off about these things though. i think they are important because as soon as you start saying institutions like art center have no merit you discredit any of these topics that we are talking about. they all survive on the same ideals.</div>

He just keeps forgetting to state it that way. Right, Jay? ;^) <BR> <BR>If we are generalizing, ok, Art Center is one of the best &hellip;. but, my point is that we shouldn't generalize. Nor should we make blanket statements that only hold up when intensely starched. That would be like saying all designers that appreicate pretty colors and strict typographic rules should work for Martha Stewart and anyone that has a penchant for carving letters into there skin should work for Sagmeister. I see what you are saying, do you see what I am saying? If your donkey remark was directed at my comments, you might not be &quot;reading&quot; what I &quot;wrote&quot;. There is no room for blindness in what I was saying. And any kind of cult implies following blindly.  <BR> <BR>So we agree on the art v. design &ndash; that is good &ndash; subjectivity is everywhere and we can't help that, but if we refuse to generalize and really stop and think for a second, it isn't subjectivity that is getting in the way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jay, I hope you realize how patient and polite I've been with you, for all your pointless arguments and name-calling. <BR> <BR>Typography is not totally subjective. There is some science in it. Some conclusions were drawn from empirical research, not just subjectivity, especially when it comes to legibility. Though they are not always so dependable. <BR> <BR>Regarding schools, I think Tiffany pretty much said what I wanted to say. The school I went to, Emily Carr Institute in Vancouver, is arguably the top art school in Canada. They have a reputation of being 'arty-farty' and really have an attitude. It is probably the coolest school to be in Canada right now. That to me is a problem. People want to go there because it is cool, not because they want to learn. I was doing a project for a client last month and he told me 'to go crazy with it'&hellip; 'you're from Emily Carr, man!'. How do you think I felt then? I don't want to be streotyped, and I think I have my own agenda of being a designer. To me, bad teachers are the ones who spoon-feed their students and hope that they'll turn their students into exact copies of themselves. On the other hand, good teachers give students access to differing opinions and let them think for themselves, and ultimately making them good designers in their own rights. It is a teacher's job to let them think for themselves: what is good design? What is design even? Whatever that might be. The job of the teacher is to provide guidance in order to help them to fulfill their own personal goals. The least a teacher could do is to embrace the difference of his/her students.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">tiffany you are always a pleasant voice of reason. believe it or not though i don't quite agree with you on the whole generalization issue. like i said before i think we under value generalizations in today's culture because they aren't p.c.. current postmodern thought dictates that we shouldn't be hasty and that we should step back and analyze every possibility until we are impotent to make a decision. i think this is a horrible way to approach things. though it may be too much for some of you to hear, i think generalizations are very valuable. general consensus becomes cultural fact. it doesn't matter if it is scientifically true or not it is true to the culture and that is what matters at the moment. this can be illustrated by the culture of of the 1950's when maybe 90%, or so, of america believed that god actually was real. it did not matter that science would make major movements to over throw this idea (or at the very least drastically alter it) latter on changing the reality of culture. if you were alive in the 1950's it was indisputable fact that god was real. i'm not naive enough to say that generalizations are always true though a lot of the time they are. i'm just a realist who says they are the truth at the moment as far as you and i are concerned and that's all that really matters. i think we are all tired of hearing that one exception to a generalization as though it changes the truth of that generalization e.g. all black labs are black (generalization) but my cousin has a black lab that is albino (exception) so not all black labs are black. this just gets stupid because the fact still remains that 99.9% of black labs are black. there is always an exception to any generalization but that does not make the generalization false. that is the beauty of the generalization, they are flexible. granted you are right too but i think you are to quick to dismiss a generalization because of a weak exception. <BR> <BR>as far as the donkey thing goes you're reading too much into it. i'm only using it as a surface level example. and i'm not sure i understand your last comment, so please expound. <BR> <BR>anonymous, just because your a huge wimp doesn't mean i forgot about you. what kind of wuss makes a post as anonymous and asks me my credentials. you won't even list your name. i'm surprised you even know what art center is but the fact that you do says it all. let's see what you have to say about any issues here and then we'll talk credentials. <BR> <BR>and hrant. i don't really think you can be that lost its all pretty simple. just take off your rose colored glasses of idealism and look at the reality of it all.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">jay. true, TDR aren't solely responsible for helvetica's revival, although they are largely responsible for bringing helvetica back &quot;in vogue&quot; amongst &quot;new media designers&quot;. they are idolised by so many designers and therefore highly influentual in terms of typeface choice and style. <BR> <BR>who'd of thought helvetica neue 95 black could look so good. ;) <BR> <BR>i also agree with you on your point of modernism coming back around. i think its a good thing, it means younger designers are seeing that theres more to design than just making things look &quot;cool&quot;, and designing based merely on aesthetics. <BR> <BR>iota. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">why thank you iota, you are one of the first people to agree with me &lt;joke&gt;. but i still have to say that i don't think it's just one or even a couple of design shops that can be blamed for the resurgence of helvetica. i think it is much more broad than that and is more deeply rooted in cultural shifts as a whole. <BR> <BR>as far as helvetica neue black is concern it does look oh sooooo good. it sure is a handsome typeface. <BR> <BR>when it comes to postmodern-modernism i am sad to report that for most it is still just an aesthetic or trend. it takes a concerned type of designer to really get at the meat of any aesthetic he is involved with (or ripping off).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">keith, i'm offended that you would call our arguments pointless and i'm not sure where you got the idea that i was calling you names. i think you might have misread my honesty as an insult. it's not. as a matter of fact i quite respect your opinions, i may think they are timid and unrealistic but i still respect them. i even respect hrants opinions because though he has no idea i do in fact know exactly where he is coming from. he is the one you should really be afraid of. back to the topic at hand, the funny thing is that i'm an idealist about type like you are but i am much more of a realist than an idealist. i think most of you are caught up, way too much, in a type of egotistical idealism. you may think i am an egotistical maniac but i am in fact less of one then you would ever know. i just enjoy bringing people back down to earth. you should look at my comments as a humorous breath of fresh air &lt;joke&gt;. <BR> <BR>it's funny how much you guys get all up in arms about the art center thing. it makes me laugh. it just shows how impressive of a school it is. you would have no idea but i actually like talking to people who have no idea what it is because they have no need to try and prove anything. you guys are a sorry lot.</div>

Maybe you're just being a devil's advocate? <BR> <BR>I didn't get 'all up in arms' about Art Center. I in fact considered Art Center for grad school. It looked like a great place to be in. It's just way too out of budget for me: it was $9,000 per semester when I looked a few years ago. Times it by six (was it six semesters in total?) and it's $54,000 for the whole course! WAY WAY too expensive. I just don't think one should get too caught up about schools&hellip; that's all. <BR> <BR>Time to go to bed. You too, eh, Jay? You're in Seattle? It's just a few hours down the road from here&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">like i said before, art center is way to expensive. it is more money then any one person should spend on design (except clients). but it is a great school and i'll stand by that. i obviously have too. the greatest thing about art center though is that you can come into forums like this drop the name and watch everyone stir up like a hive of bees. <BR> <BR>enjoy the evening keith.</div>

This is why jw seems to have learnt so little at such an expensive school. His immaturity, combined with his awe for expensive things has resulted in very poor value from his (or someone's) educational spending. <BR> <BR>I have no idea if art center offer any scholarships, or if a proportion of students there are funded through any means other than private wealth, but if all or most of the students are paying their own fees, then it seems to me that art center would suffer from limiting its constituency to the wealthy, which is always a recipe for declining standards.  <BR> <BR>jw, I think you upset people because almost as soon as you arrive hereyou namedrop the art center into the conversation, then demonstrate that you have very little understanding, but you put your views forcefully and with personal insults attached. <BR> <BR>It may appear to many of the designers here (who may have had to really struggle to get where they are today) that you bought yourself an expensive education and now you behave as if you  think that entitles you to instant respect. <BR> <BR>It doesn't.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">steven, you have missed the point from long ago. i've already said what you have said here but let me paraphrase. great institutions like art center attract great teachers but great teachers don't always make great students. it makes me laugh to see individuals like you violently react to posts that are just out rightly honest about these or any other issues. you don't seem to take things well yourself. if you'd just sit back drop some of your own internal ego struggles you might be able to see what i'm saying in most of these posts. no where have i said i'm better than anyone else here. you are just reading these things into it because my guess is that you are having internal struggles with you own ego and out right honesty is hard to swallow. as far as name dropping goes&hellip; whatever, if someone went to art center they went to art center, get over it. i don't hold this up as a way of saying i'm better i've just said i can attest to the fact that it's a great school with great instructors.</div>

Most of the faculty at Art Center are simply working professionals recruited locally. Most of them are part-time faculty working for what we call in Southern California, &quot;freeway teaching wages.&quot; Otis and Cal Arts pay their part-timers relatively about the same. (A bit less for Otis, a bit more for Cal Arts.) I've also taught at these institutions. The institutional take on this is that part-time professionals bring their experience to the table as well as a willingness to contribute or to give back to society what they have been given. Which is greatly true, but is certainly not the entire picture. <BR> <BR>Perhaps some of these folks are great, but are they &quot;the greats of their time&quot;? You are making a huge stretch here based on tuition costs without taking into account the reality of the economics involved.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">gerald, this has been discussed in the past as well. as far as pay for teachers is concerned i think that has little to do with why instructors choose to work for an institution like art center. pay scale is not very relevant to the merit of the institution. you yourself are teaching their and probably enjoy a certain amount respect that comes with being an instructor at art center. like i said before, art center draws great instructors because of this. i know there are exceptions and i don't think we need to hear the few that exist e.g. some so so instructor in room 135 is really pretty bad. we all know those exist in any institution but it still does not dispute the fact that this is one of the best design schools. as far as &quot;the greats of their time&quot; i do in fact think many are and so do others. professors like doyald young, for example, are masters of their craft and art center is a haven for these types of individuals.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Imho, genuinely good instructors wouldn't teach at a well-known school merely because of the respect and prestige that attach to it. A genuinely good instructor would be passionate enough to share their knowledge and experiences to any willing students, any day, not just to the elite. As we Chinese say: &quot;those who teach and those who learn grow together.&quot; I think we have to realize that teachers are not gods, and students are not always ignorant. One can never be too young to teach nor too old to learn.</div>

It's not about feeling warm and fuzzy or anything, it's about respecting others when you make your comments. It's not what you say I have trouble with, but how you say it. You just come across as a snob, that's all. If you have no intention of talking about typography and design but take pleasure in pushing other people's buttons for the sake of it, then I don't think this is the right place to do it.

		<div class="commentbody">ethen, in reply to your other post which i neglected to see initially. you bring up an age old question here &lt;joke&gt;. design and style are very interrelated. i know many here would tell you that you should pay no attention to trend and just follow the standards that have been passed down for years (which were in fact just trends at some point themselves) but i think this is unrealistic. your job as a designer is to provide a service to your client. in many cases but not all that can be to zig instead of zag. this is an attempt to help them stand out. as far as the trend you are sighting, it really depends on how large it is and how entrenched your client is or should be in relation to it. weather to follow a trend or forge a new trend is very dependent on this issue. that being said there is also the element of the designers personal voice. i think this is important too. you need to love what you do and clients in the end will love you because of it. nobody likes a zombie robot that produces something with no soul. anyway i guess that's a good enough start on such a huge topic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's strange that you think type only communictes to designers. Only designers who ignore craft think type is made for them. Some of the best design work relies very heavily on the type. <BR> <BR>As for what I personally prefer: I would ideally like to make the best type the world has ever seen (I would like to surpass Granjon - it's a dream, hey), and be recognized for that by my peers. I don't give a rat's arse who uses the results, mostly because participating in this Cool Capitalism (which I admit to having to do to some extent, but a lot less than the average graphic designer) reduces my appetite. I'd rather not help sell CRAP to the same vultures who drive their gold Cadillac Escalades to the latest Hollywood releases. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">What a great discussion! Sorry to have been travelling. First of all, a little historical perspective &ndash; I was there, boots on the ground (joke), when Neue Haas Grotesk was introduced. I thought it was heaven-sent. The only guy setting it in the US soon thereafter was Roy Rothstein of Type&amp; Art in Cleveland. Up until then the only decent sans serif we had was News Gothic. In Europe there was Akzidenz Grotesk. I simplify but only because there's enough text posted here already. When my 25-year hitch with Polaroid ended and they decided to do all the design in-house, converting everything to Helvetica, my parting shot was &quot;Congratulations, your typeface can be seen on every airport toilet throughout the free world.&quot;  <BR> <BR>Even so, Helvetica is a usable face, Avante Garde an abomination. It simply can't be read. NHG when set by the Swiss was eminently readable in at least three languages.  <BR> <BR>Thirdly, there is a difference between being educated and learning. My late Mass. Art schoolmate and friend, Jacqueline Casey, blossomed as a great designer at MIT in spite of a ho-hum curriculum. The same can be said of her colleague, Muriel Cooper. I think it's all about intellectual curiosity, and if one doesn't have it, it doesn't matter where he or she has been &quot;educated.&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Whoa there,
Seven fingers. Don&rsquo;t make me break those two extras by punchin you in the nose. I happen to be a New Media Designer (which I agree is a strange title) but you have to admit it&rsquo;s much easier to say than mutidisciplinary proponent of aesthetics specializing in the application of current and emerging methods of application. Did you ever stop to think that the reason NMD&rsquo;s use helvetica so much is because they are getting paid to do so. I&rsquo;m sorry but I have to quote snoop dogg when I say &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hate the player hate the game.&rdquo; I also am a bit miffed about the over saturation of the media and over use of certian techniques but you have to remember that these old washed up art directors are looking for those &ldquo;catch phrase&rdquo; designers to do something &ldquo;hip&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo; but then force them to copy eachother. I&rsquo;d have to say that if you want to gripe talk to the old farts who still use Quark and lay everything out in sabon about loosening the reigns and letting us go to town. I promise you I would never use Helvetica again if I could make the same money using cabinet, or eiko, or damske, or Chola, or..you get the point.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As another so called &lsquo;New Media Designer&rsquo; I just thought I&rsquo;d offer my perspective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Media Designers&rdquo; work on the screen. Only a fool would ever set text for reading in Helvetica on screen as it would be even less legible than it&rsquo;s printed counterpart. Reading off the screen is a bitch full stop - why make it more painful?</p>
<p>Helvetica Neue is a useful display face. For people like myself it&rsquo;s a great way to get into display typography because it has so many different weights and variants. If you&rsquo;re ten years older than me you&rsquo;ll hate it because it was old hat when you were a young designer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What I like about Helvetica these days is its blandness. I a design surrounding where Kievit, Thesis et al have become the new Helvetica in their everyday use, I think a relatively underdesigned font such as Helvetica has a certain simplistic flair, a stupidness for lack of better words, that just works. Same goes, to a lesser degree, for DIN, for Courier and for some other fonts. Absurdely,  feel the same way about Garamond these days. Grossly overused, I find myself using it more and more often, because it IS so commonplace. Much as I love well-done typophile fonts and always hunt for notoverused serif and sans-serif typefaces, I find myself coming back to Helvetica (or similar-looking fonts such as FFBau, Galaxie Polaris or RKW Sans, which is a remix of Helvetica BQ we did with URW++) and Garamond again and again. I recently did a book-design and used Franklin for that, a font I haven&rsquo;t touched in well over a decade. But its crude mixture (in my mind) of simplicity and america-advertising-noise aswell as a certain Kalmanesque feeling made it the only viable option. Sometimes the wrong font is really the only right choice. Maybe I&rsquo;m just tired of the delicateness of all these new, well-done typefaces and look for something clumsy and plain and stupid and honest?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>PS: 
As an example, I work on flyers, a brochure and a flash-based Site for suchthilfe.direkt, a local drug-aid and habilitation center. My idea is that, well, drugs and their usage is overdramatized in the media. I didn&rsquo;t want to show junkies and opted instead for something that struck me during the days of research and photoshooting in their facilities: It&rsquo;s mostly a very efficient, very bureaucratic job they do. The whole streetworker-cliché I had in mind just doesn&rsquo;t hold true, they&rsquo;re justr professionals doing their best in their field. It&rsquo;s all pretty banal, it LOOKS and FEELS banal. And that, imo, was good. 
So we took very very nondescript photos, very downscale, very everyday. I wanted to emphasize that drug-abuse and thus drug-aid is normal, is mundane, is a job like everything else. Instead of showing the fear-inducing imagery of other campaingns, I opt for, more or less&hellip; a kind of down-to-earthiness :-D</p>
<p>And damn, I spent WEEKS deciding on the design and the typeface. Frustrating, annoyinbg weeks. It all still felt too much like advertising, it pushed up too many emotions, it jst did not feel cool enough, bland enough, simple enough.</p>
<p>The final design is as simple as can be and the typeface, of all the choices available, is UNIVERS. definitively not a typeface I use often these days. Univers&hellip; simple, honest, straightforward. No real ligatures, no OSFs, no Caps, overused and still kind of the ugly girl at the dance party. And it fit perfectly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite often the same with Helvetica. The bad font is sometimes the only viable option.</p>
