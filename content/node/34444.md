body: This is a font which seems to resemble Bookman Swash, but I can't seem to find
  a variation where all of the letters are the same as the example I have attached...
  This is a logo that was trademarked in 1961 and now I HAVE to find the font for
  it somewhere. Does anyone have any suggestions?
