  body: "I could not find this either. I searched Dafont and MyFonts. I know there
    are plenty of other sources, but those two are a pretty good sampling of commercial
    and free fonts.\r\n\r\nSomething slightly similar was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aah-yes/perio/|Perio]]
    from Aah Yes, or [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/regula/fonts/|Regula]] from Storm,
    which you would have to add the notches to simulate the carve marks.\r\n\r\nLets
    hope someone else can spot it.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
