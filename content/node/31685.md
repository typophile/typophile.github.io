  -- I'm simply looking for guidance and advice, or whether or not I should even pursue
  this direction...\r\n\r\nI started my freelance business close to two years ago.
  At the time I wasn't too concerned with my identity (big mistake) so I quickly created
  something that I've had trouble living with lately. I've already <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/15365\">questioned
  it once here on typophile</a>. Since then, I've constantly tinkered and doodled
  trying to come up with something new, and I've finally come up with a mark that
  I'm happy with -- at least I think so.\r\n\r\nMy business has migrated almost entirely
  into website design and development, and I'm one of those standards-based nuts.
  I want to give a feeling of pride and craftsmanship about my work -- you know, the
  little guy who sits in his shop and creates handmade goodness -- but I want to avoid
  the web 2.0 look.\r\n\r\nAny and all comments are most appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

    when I look at it, I can't help thinking that it's missing some text, like \"Addison
    Hall Design\". Having said this, I'm not really sure where you'd put it!\r\n\r\nI
    realise that the initials are already there, but I see them as more of a pictoral
    icon rather than typographical. Perhaps there could be a logo with the 'Addison
    Hall Design' text, and one without? \r\n\r\nI don't know, and maybe people will
    disagree, just my initial reaction!"

    the line weight a bit. For instance, if your text is set in Light, up it to Book.
    Redraw the H to match the weight of the A and D.\r\n\r\nKinda reminds me of the

    a little, but I still want to retain a sort of engraved look if possible. The
    letterforms are based on <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/index.html\">Bryant</a>,
    so naturally I also used it for the type treatment. I think I'm getting closer
    with the mark, but the type still needs some work.\r\n\r\nRegarding my attempts
    to even out the weight of the strokes, the screen is playing tricks on me. Things
    appear much better zoomed in than they do small. I'll have to print it out at

    glass upside-down, effectively reducing the image.\r\n\r\nDon't laugh, consider
    that you this way you multiply the resolution of the print AND can see what the
    design looks like in RL.\r\n\r\nAnother good trick is holding your print upside
    down and looking thru your lashes. Inner spaces and letterspacing become cleare
    that way.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 bits."

    and posted another image. I'm also beginning to consider how it can actually be
    used, and I like the idea of the logotype (someone correct me if I'm mislabeling
    it) appearing separately from the mark in some occasions. The long name isn't
    very compact, but if I'm controlling everything, that shouldn't give me too much

    A is the typical front and back, with the logo presented on a clean field on one
    side and all of my info on the other. Version B is a one sided card, but I subdued
    the logo a bit thinking that I might even blind emboss it. I've avoided color
    altogether for now until I resolve the layout.\r\n\r\nThe long email address bugs
    me (but I'm stuck with it) especially on version B. Version A gives it room to

    I've called my buddy at the printer to come talk to me about business cards, and
    possibly some labels for letterhead, envelopes, and other miscellaneous uses (who
    knows), but for now I've posted my last round of ideas. It's more business cards,
    but this time they're all on one side -- for some reason I just felt I needed
    to resolve it this way. I like the front and back as well, so we'll see.\r\n\r\nAs
    I said, I've also come up with a label idea for various applications -- mainly
    letterhead and envelopes. I thought this could be an inexpensive way to treat
    my stationery while providing a way to create proposal covers and such, too. Has
    anyone done anything like this? Again, I've avoided color, but I'm assuming that
    I'll use a 1 color flood of something.\r\n\r\nOne other question, and maybe this
    is another topic: when is it appropriate to use your business' legal name? This
    came up earlier in the thread, but I'm curious as to when it's supposed to be
    used and when it's unnecessary. Does anyone know?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

  body: "Addison,\r\n\r\nThis is looking very strong. I think the centered version
    is better for those instances when you find yourself wanting to use them together.
    Unless you add more space as I find myself want the H to somehow read with the
    line of text.\r\n\r\nI think B of the cards is best. There is something odd about
    having the tagline with the address information.\r\n\r\nAs for the label. I might
    move the address information further to the right, creating symmetric spacing
    on the right, top and bottom of the block of text. I also might toy with the idea
    of having the label perforated to help with even folds. This would make you use
    the label on the same side, but I think you might really appreciate not having
    to worry if it is square or not.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/perfsomethinglikethis_5377.png]"

    have to add more space between the mark and the type. I'd really like a version
    that is more compact overall, but nothing looks nearly as nice as the centered
    version.\r\n\r\nThe perforation is a good idea so I'll talk to my printer about
    that. I did want the flexibility of placing the label on either side of something,
    but maybe that isn't much of an issue (I need to commit!).\r\n\r\nCost is also
    a concern, especially since I'd possibly like to have the mark on the cards blind
    embossed, or something else special. So that may affect what I decide to do with
    the labels."

  body: "BUSINESS CARD:\r\nThe rule,T,E,W are added elements. If you removed them,
    would the viewer still know what the information was? The titling-characters are
    useful when there are several items of similar nature. I bet someone knows what
    sequence of numbers containing the @ means much more easily than a stand-alone
    (E). They would know what a sequence ending with (.com) means. If you had only
    one sequence numbers seperated with (.) and in the 3.3.4 combination, someone
    has been exposed to this enough to deduct that it is most-likely not your fascimile.
    I say this, because the mark is so beautifully simple everything else should follow
    suit or deviate for a reason.\r\n\r\nMONOGRAM:\r\nVery interesting. Looks great
    reversed and normal. Did you try to create it out of pixels(squares).\r\n\r\nTYPE:\r\nThe
    numerals are too large. They do not flow. I would suggest reducing them a 1/4
    point. It looks like you spent much more time on your mark than you did on type-setting
    and any other graphic elements.\r\n\r\nCOLOR:\r\nColour is such an important element
    in user-interaction within electronic medium. Why was it ruled out? \r\n\r\nTAGLINE:\r\nI
    know what you are trying to say. It is true, but it worries me. Some will see
    it as craftsmanship. Others will see it as \"She's so crafty\". You're at the
    mercy of the left-brainer's employ and the word craft may mean \"artsy, creative,
    tinkering\". Probably not your intent. This very word may prove to have a negative
    impact on trying to convince someone the worth of your consultation, knowledge,
    etc.. You may lump yourself into the category (kid-nextdoor), regardless of your
    age. \r\n\r\nYou must consider the visualization of each individual word. What
    will your audience see when they read \"crafting\"? Crafting works well in this
    forum, but how would it be perceived by someone reading the Harvard Business Journal.
    That person may have 150k allocated for their corporate site. Wouldn't you want
    to be on their short-list?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    yet, but that certainly seems to be a possibility\r\n\r\nRegarding the type --
    while I love Bryant, I eventually found it to be, well, not exactly what I was

    as a text font, and it just feels better (at least for now).\r\n\r\nColor was

    to a non-designer. Her only remark was that the address and city, as well as the
    phone and website, needed some sort of separator. I tried to find some other examples
    and ultimately referred to Bringhurst's <i>Elements</i>. If I understand correctly,
    he seems to recommend a middot or a virgule (forward slash) as a \"sign of separation\".
    In my last attachment, you'll see that I've tried both of these approaches. I'd
    love to hear some other thoughts on this before I shoot this off to the printer.\r\n\r\nWhatever
