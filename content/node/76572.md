  is not a something completely unique to Polish; there is one other language which
  appends something to its letters that genuinely looks like an ogonek in exactly
  the way that the cedilla doesn't.\r\n\r\nIt is of polytonic Greek that I speak,
  and the iota subscript.\r\n\r\nSince it is in origin a subscript letter, while the
  ogonek is in origin simply a differentiating mark, like the cedilla, the two marks
  aren't really the \"same\" mark in terms of their origin. But they are both hooks
  pointing and sloped in the same direction, so at least each one tends to support
  understanding how to draw the other one properly, whereas subscript commas and cedillas
  tempt people to replace the ogonek by things that don't look like an ogonek at all."

    observation which sticks on the surface and helps very litle.\r\nThe iota subscr.
    IS NOT A HOOK. It is *a iota*. What points to the right on iota glyphs is *a serif*.\r\n\r\nDON\u2019T
    mix up iota subscriptum with the ogonek. Don\u2019t mix it up with anything else.
    The both have literally nothing in common."
