  and wishes to invite you to a costume party.\r\n\r\nAnd, since the blog is growing
  up thanks to its audience, it is fair to extend this invitation to everyone who
  is interested.\r\n\r\nSo, this is the right moment to show the world how much we've
  learnt in the past 2 years and how fearless of typography we've become. We'll play
  to dress the Letritas line logo any way you want.\r\n\r\nEvery work sent will be
  published in the blog, along with its credits and portfolio URL (and address contact
  if you wish), as well as a brief comment of the costume's concept.\r\n\r\nOn Friday,
  March 28, lights of colors will glow and our guests will come to show their best
  dance-steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this moment consider yourselves invited.\r\n\r\nWishing
  you all the best, Juan Pablo de Gregorio"

    to talk about this \"type game\" earlier in the blog. These are some links to
    the articles:\r\n\r\n[[http://letritas.blogspot.com/2006/04/jugando-ser-garamond.html|Jugando
    a ser Garamond]]\r\n\r\n[[http://letritas.blogspot.com/2006/10/la-fiesta-de-disfraces.html|La
    fiesta de disfraces]]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust in case you need any motivation or further
    information to understand this game, I'm submitting this two examples.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letritashippie_4961.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letritascaligrafia_4900.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou
