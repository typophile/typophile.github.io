  body: "El Tigre.\r\n\r\n\"Six years later in 1973, under similar material and time
    constraints, Alvarez would produce El Tigre in immediate response to the American-backed
    coup in Chile. The resulting film was Alvarez's most purely mournful, and one
    of his most devastating. Yet that film is virtually unknown while Hasta\u2026
    remains one of Alvarez's most familiar works. \"\r\n(from http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/01/17/hasta.html)"

  body: "In the 60s, there were white clay letters very similar to those.  They were
    often used in low budget film for titles.  The clay letters were arranged on a
    black background and shot as film.  Later, the title footage was burned into the
    live action scene for titles.  I used the clay letters myself in film school many
    years ago.\r\n\r\n ChrisL"
