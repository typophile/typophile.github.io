  and i could find anything that would suit my logo, company name FOURMATION.\r\n\r\nOption
  1: Is the first attempt but decided that the font would be better suited to my logo
  if it was longer and narrower which ended up being Option 2.\r\n\r\nDo these work?
  Do they look ok? Is the kerning ok?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fourmation_3748.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Michael,\r\n\r\nIt's tricky to tell how effective this will be without
    knowing something about the company. What are the values and unique propositions
    of this company? That should inform the choice of type and design concept. \r\n\r\nAt
    first glance, this doesn't on its own grab my attention. The best logos have the
    power to attract further interest about the organisation. I'm not sure what your
    logo is telling me.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to stick with this type rather than
    find the perfect font, there are a couple of potential improvements I'd suggest.
    The tracking is tight, which means at small sizes especially on screen the letters
    will join together. Then, to do with letter widths and white space, the F and
    M need attention. The F, having all that white space underneath, needs narrowing
    to counterbalance that. I'd also do something to the M to increase the white space
    under the armpits and decrease the upper counter, it looks unbalanced to me. The
    T could be narrowed in the same way as F. N looks narrow. The A looks similar
    to the R, and the eye has to work to resolve that distinction I feel.\r\n\r\nIs
    this logotype to be used alone or will there be a graphic element too?"

  body: "It doesn't look really bad, but making a custom font might turn out harder
    than you think. There are many fonts in this style available out there, so I'd
    just by one of them. If you can't find them. Post a new topic about it here on
    typophile.\r\n\r\nIf you insist on making a custom font:\r\n\r\nMake your curves
    smoother\r\nMake the horizontall thinner\r\nF narrower\r\nO wider\r\nU smaller\r\nT
    smaller\r\nAn I with horizontal strokes on the top and bottom might look good.\r\nSpacing
    needs some work too, but that's for later."
