  Press history? I can't find printed samples. I wonder how Carol at Adobe did Caslon,
  there are so many different cuts.

    you should check out: [[Nicolete Gray]] and <a href="http://www.rit.edu/~rkelly/html/05_obs/obs_wood1.html">Rob
    Roy Kelly</a>. You should be able to find their books through a public library.'

  body: "Correct me if I'm wrong,\r\nDidn't they call it Egyptian because it had a
    \"slab\" base to it, like a sculpture? I think it was first used for ads in Europe,
    and they could make the letter larger because they were made from wood instead
    of metal."

  body: "The term egyptian appears to have come about to describe the original grotesques,
    which appeared during a period known as \u201CEgyptomania\u201D when the British
    were obsessed with all things Egyptian. At some later point the term became associated
    with slab serifs that were also popular during that period. If you search around
    you\u2019ll find a thread started by Missgiggles in which James Mosely kindly
    dropped by to straighten this out. "

  body: "One theory is that the term Egyptian was adopted because Egyptology was so
    fashionable at that time. The monolithic connection is probably relevant, but
    then they could've called it Stonehenge too.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
