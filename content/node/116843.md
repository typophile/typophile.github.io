body: "Hi everyone\r\nI hope someone can give me a little guidance. After combing
  through the forum for serif combinations with Avenir, I thought I would try a direct
  request. I am about to embark on the design of a range of reports for a Europrean
  rail transportation organisation. The reports will be of varying length, the biggest
  being about 140 (roughly A4) pages long. The reports themselves will be combining
  full colour imagery, pull out case studies, maps and various charts and graphs.
  It's a pretty large undertaking all in all and I really want to do a good job.\r\n\r\nThe
  organisation makes use of Avenir as their primary face, although I'm actually leaning
  towards using Avenir Next as it seems to offer more flexibility. However, I'd really
  like to find a nice serif to pair it with.\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think of using
  Avenir Next for body copy? Would it be too tiring on the eye? And what do you think
  would be a nice serif for body instead? I really like Freight serif/ micro - would
  these work at all? Avenir Next would most likely be used for major headings to keep
  in line with the overall brand, if that makes any difference.\r\n\r\nTo be honest
  I'm having a bit of an attack of nerves so any advice would be SO appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that Avenir (not Next) needs to be used. So any help with a pairing would be great!\r\nThanks"

  body: "Hi J. Tillman,\r\nI'm not married to Avenir as the body/ text font - from
    what I understand it is not so great for setting long content. I'd prefer to use
    it for headings and pull outs/ case studies. So really I'm looking for something
    that will work for longer text. Any ideas?"
