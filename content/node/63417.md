body: "hi, thats my first post here on typophile and I hope that my entry is on the
  right position. A client of mine asked me, if i could digitalize his adscript. i
  have a few skills in typetool and so I could imagine to solve this mission.\r\n\r\nthis
  font should be a additional piece in a existing corporate design, so it should be
  good product. have anybody any knowledge of digitalizing adscripts and can give
  me a few tipps.\r\n\r\ni know that block capitals are far easier to vectorize as
  a adsript. maybe there are a important basics, which i have to know before i start.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nalexgrimm"
