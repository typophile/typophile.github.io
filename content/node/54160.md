  body: "<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/register-sans-btn/\">Register
    Sans BTN</a> is a recent typeface which is close... but not an exact match --
    the U and the R are different, for example.\r\n\r\nThe album is from 1968, and
    the cover of the vinyl record had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Light/White_Heat\">a
    slightly different layout</a>.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] PublishingMojo beat me to it... I
    feel ashamed that I did not recognize <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/kabel/\">Kabel</a>!!!"
