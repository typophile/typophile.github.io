  aiming for quick letter recognition in a logo.  Any ideas?

    casual, exotic? There are a lot of scripts out there. More info will help us make
    better suggestions."

  body: "For a logo, OpenType scripts with alts and ligs would be good, but you won't
    find an online typetester that shows them, although Underware does show Bello's
    tricks on their site.\r\nI would recommend my own Handsome Pro Extra Bold, I guess
    I should produce a PDF which shows all the ligatures and alternates."

    to find something even cleaner.  House's fonts tend to have a bit of whimsy, but
    I want something a little more, I don't know, authoritative?  Does this sound
    like any font you know?\r\n\r\nhttp://houseind.com?page=showfont&id=27&subpage=viewfonts"

    today there seems to be a problem \u2014 I can't navigate there. But it's worth
    a try."

    scripts</a>. But these might be too formal for you.

    something that looks more machine-made.  Let the rest of my logo supply the personality,
    just give me a good trade script."
