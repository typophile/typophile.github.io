  body: "It is unfortunate that font designs are being copied widely, and have a lack
    of legal protection, at least in some countries.\r\n\r\nOf course, I cannot condemn
    makers of cheap font CDs too harshly when I remember that the major typesetting
    machine companies and typefounders had been taking advantage of the lax legal
    regime to do the exact same thing.\r\n\r\nThe solution, of course, is what ITC
    had been trying to do. Instead of a type designer working for Linotype, or Monotype,
    or Compugraphic, or Bitstream, type designers design their fonts independently,
    and through a co-operative organization similar to ASCAP, license their fonts
    on equal terms for use on any phototypesetting system.\r\n\r\nOf course, today,
    all that is obsolete. People don't use phototypesetters, they use high-resolution
    laser printers, and TrueType, Type 1, and OpenType work on them all just fine.
    So you can buy a typeface from Linotype and use it on any laser printer, even
    if it were made by ATF or VariTyper."

    love literature, love books, and find the notion of an \"out of print\" book in

    451\" phenomenon going on.\r\nNearly all of 20th Century culture in print is being
    held hostage by a very, very small percentage of rights holders whose works still
    have some commercial value.\r\nIt was *my* Congress who got bought off and voted
    for this sh-t. Reform is way overdue.\r\n\r\nThe music industry periodically sues
    kids who download music to make an example out of them. But they're an easy target
    public-relations-wise. They're just trying to get a freebie. Is the publishing
    industry going to sue middle-aged librarians and college profesors who are doing
    this on principle? I really want to see how that flies.\r\n\r\nrich"

    is a good enough reason to ignore or abolish copyright law. I do feel that copyright
    law is intended to benefit society by encouraging the production of new works
    - it is not a compulsory respect for the human rights of authors - and so legislators
    should not extend copyright in every way that vested interests ask them to.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, as an English speaker living in Canada, I can very easily go to thrift
    shops and pick up a vast number of books on all sorts of subjects at bargain prices,
    while fully respecting copyright law.\r\n\r\nOther people are not so fortunate.
    Thus, the people who live in Eastern Europe, for example, if they are seeking
    books that have honest contents, that have not been cruelly deformed into making
    a mockery of truth, must, at least for works on many subjects, confine themselves
    to books published recently, or imported books in foreign languages. Except for
    books on the most politically innocuous of subjects, therefore, books are likely
    to be more expensive: perhaps used copies at half price of last year's popular
    books, but not at thrift shop or library book sale prices.\r\n\r\nSo I suspect
    that for them, much more than for us, the copyright issue you outline is a genuinely
    serious matter."

    fight this crime.\r\n\r\nthe second kind of \"piracy\" is people \"sharing\" with

    sale\" is typically considered as fully legal under the law.\r\nyou can loan a
    paper-book just like you loan a lawn-mower.\r\n\r\nthe world of book-publishing
    is acquainted, long and well,\r\nwith both of these types of \"piracy\", thank

    same thing.\r\n\r\nthat's why i laughed when you said publishers\r\nare just starting

    \"casual friendly sharing\" is something that\r\npeople expect to be able to do
    with paper-books.\r\nand indeed, there's nothing illegal about it at all...\r\n\r\nno,
    to the contrary, under the \"first sale doctrine\",\r\nthis is a legal right that
    people have with p-books.\r\nin addition to loaning them to other people, you\r\ncan
    also rent books, or sell them used outright...\r\n\r\nall of this \"takes income
    from the author's pocket\",\r\nif you choose to think about it that particular
    way,\r\nbut it's all perfectly legal, and it jives with our sense\r\nof the way
    things \"should\" be, as per our experience.\r\n\r\nit's also the case that _libraries_
    \"take income from\"\r\nauthors, if you choose to think about it that way, but\r\n--
    once again -- that's the way the world was set up.\r\na copy of the book is bought,
    once, so the author\r\nand the publisher are paid, and then that copy gets\r\nloaned
    out, perhaps dozens of times over its lifetime,\r\neven though the author was
    only paid that one time...\r\n\r\nthe thing is, what publishers are trying to
    do now, is\r\nto change the _sale_ of a book into a _rental_ instead,\r\nand a
    strictly constrained rental at that, via a \"license\".\r\n\r\nthey even want
    to try to \"enforce\" the license via d.r.m.\r\n\r\nthis gets to be ridiculous.\r\n\r\nand
    similarity between books and fonts breaks down.\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n"

    it doesn't really make a clear case for the difference between digital and physical

    this doctrine previous to your posting . . .\r\n\r\nOtherwise one wrinkle in your
    post regarding libraries states they as well as non-profit educational institutions
    are exempt from this doctrine.\r\n\r\nFurther, EULAs aside, so long as the terms
    of the sale are presented and accepted by the user prior to their ability to take
    possession of the good, there is a strong case against the first sale doctrine,
    especially if they demonstrated acceptance of the terms prior to purchase and/or
