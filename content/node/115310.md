    and you can find it under the following names:\r\n<strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Font-Bureau&ffam=New%20York%20-%20Regular&fid=a861edf9bbc78d0102107f6ff619472d&fsize=60&text=QRCA&fit=1|New

    source for the above fonts and there is another font in myfonts.com under the
    name \"New York\" which corresponds to the initial bitmap font designed for Apple
    by Susan Kare, which is obviously a different (sans serif) font:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/new-york/\r\n\r\nAny
    ideas?"
