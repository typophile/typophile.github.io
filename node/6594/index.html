<div class=commentbody>::shakes head:: <br> <br>I'd love to know the story behind it. What combination of factors yielded that conclusion? I think the red smear symbolizes the mourning of the old logo's passing. This seems to be a logo reinvention along the same lines as Northwestern's; the desire for newness colliding horribly with the desire to not change anything, producing a parody of the original logo's logic.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Joe they are targeting the same audience. Why reinvent the wheel. Design wise it hurts to look at them but the companies only care about their investors and the bottom line. Its not about taste, its about the culture of these chains. Appeal to the lowest common denominator.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually the hippest of these companies (Target) started <br>a trend that places importance on Design ... it's pervasive. <br>The other companies are merely jumping on the Target wagon, which <br>is being driven by ... Design and Designers of all things. <br> <br>Kristin Dooley of MegaCorp. can discuss this more. <br>But in my opinion, appealing to the LCD is not an <br>accurate description of what's happening in this particular <br>retailing arena. <br> <br>btw, <br>Target > WalMart > KMart are mass-merchant <br>retailers, while Sears is in a class called Mid-Tier. <br> <br>Sears also isn't typically a Big Box retailer ... it's more <br>tied to malls. <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't mind the move to U&lc. Their all caps design may have <br>been better executed, but it was tired. I just wonder, if they're <br>going to take the effort to redesign, why they don't go all the way. <br> <br>And yes, Armin. That a and r are really unfortunate. <br> <br>____ <br> <br>Mass-market appeal is one thing, but that doesn't mean they <br>should apply a design formula to get there. Just because your <br>research says you should appeal to x y and z doesn't mean <br>you should copy the others who seem to already be there. None <br>of these brands are helped by more sameness. <br> <br>No need to be an apologist for more bad design - especially <br>when it just makes them look like everybody else. This doesn't <br>serve them well, it hurts their ability to be distinct in the <br>marketplace. <br> <br>BJ, You're right that Sears is probably more of a mid-tier store, <br>but any big store with an automotive department is asking for . =) <br> <br>____ <br> <br>Re: Target. It's clear they're leading the way and proving that <br>design matters. K-mart tried hard to follow that trend but <br>the Martha Stewart line (even with packaging by Doyle Partners) <br>couldn't save them. <br> <br>Speaking of Target, have you seen the consumer electronics <br>department. There's some great low-end (based on price point) <br>Virgin electronics there. <br> <br>____ <br> <br>More red-and-blue-bold-sans-italic-big-store sameness. <br> <br><a href=http://www.costco.com/ target=_blank>http://www.costco.com/</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>"None <br>of these brands are helped by more sameness. " <br> <br>And that's clearly how/why Target took the move it did. Instead of competing with Wal-Mart (which, in many ways, is actually selling 'cheap' above anything else), Target decided to differentiate itself (by selling 'design' above anything else). <br> <br>The problem with Kmart is that it got stuck in the middle and didn't know what to do. They brought in Martha, but left the rest of the store looking like an outdated Wal-Mart. They went with the incredibly cheasy 'big k' look for a while, and now their latest print ads are mirroring target again. They're just running in circles.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Armin, that's what I meant by "producing a parody of the original logo's logic". They ape the style without the structural finesse (or thought) of the original. <br> <br>Target certainly differentiates, but I think it's only doing that because it needs to have a competition point with Walmart and is trying to strike at the people (like many of us) who point up their noses concerning Walmart, which is essentially eating middle-America alive. My parents used to live in a town that was/is utterly commercially dominated by the Walmart. Go to a rural town that's slightly flagging economically, and you'll probably find a Walmart nearby. <br> <br>Kmart is, from what I gather, just winding itself down in preparation to become <a href=http://www.messenger-inquirer.com/features/business/7420234.htm>an investment company</a>, which benefits the stockholders, who are calling the shots. <br> <br>So, the image schizophrenia is probably partially a fast series of marketing gymnastics to drive the stock up as hard as they can before shifting over. Also, they probably don't have much in the way of a driving brand concept since they're on the way out anyway. Apparently, the Chairman of Kmart (Ed Lampert) is also spending time in the Sears offices as well...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ah, where would a marketing department be without someone to copy? Marketing research has fallen to the level of the TV network executives who look at other peoples "numbers" and assume copying their stuff is also going to copy their market share numbers. The falacy of statistics lies in the quick jump to a conclusion and making leaps beyond what the numbers really show. Wallmart is making money because they moved the mountain to Mohamad. They brought big city volume discounts to small town America. Their logo did virtually nothing to ESTABLISH the brand, it only CARRIES the brand. <br>Sears did a similar thing years ago with catalogue sales but sat on their laurels and ignored customer service. <br> <br>ChrisL</div>

<div class=commentbody>"New Sears Logo Fresher and Friendlier" <br> <br>The Sears logo gets freshened up. Starting today you will notice a difference in the Sears logo. The logo takes on a fresher and friendlier appearance with brighter blue, lower case letters and a red arc that adds a colorful dimension. This look evokes a more modern stylish feel. As a focused retail and related services company, poised for profitable growth, the logo gives our retail landscape a more inviting look while still capturing the trust and reliability for which Sears is known. <br> <br>Marketing research (involving feedback from 600 customers in ten markets) revealed that the existing Sears logo was consistently perceived as trustworthy and reliable. Because of this feedback, the decision was made not to deviate too far from our current logo. <br> <br>This logo is available for internal use from the marketing intranet site. When using the Sears logo refer to the guidelines on this site. Internally the direction is to change the logo only on new orders and otherwise to use up existing products or paper. <br> <br>The new Sears logo is only the fourth in the company's 118-year history, succeeding the Sears script name in a rectangle introduced in 1963 and used for more than 20 years and the circular design from the 1950s.</div>
