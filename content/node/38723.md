  is a scan off of an invoice. I know that the logo was created within the last 5
  or so years. I have two samples. The first is an all caps sample of regular lettering.
  The second is an upper and lower case sample of the letting which looks to have
  been slightly modified. Maybe I'm way off base and these are two completely different
  fonts, but I don't think they are. I can provide larger samples if anyone would
  like. Knowing the budget of the client who brought this to me, I really doubt that
  it is custom lettering."

  body: "By larger samples, do you mean more letters? The lower case sample I had
    not seen before, and I think it looks hand-drawn. With no duplicate letters it
    is hard to be sure.\r\n\r\n[In order to save duplicating of effort, I have already
    searched Dafont in multiple categories, and tried using WhatTheFont -- all to
    no avail. This one's a mystery to me, so I suggested posting it here.] \r\n\r\n-

  body: Sorry for the confusion, by larger samples I meant at higher resolution. The
    client just provided me with the bottom sample yesterday afternoon.

  body: "Well, I should say, the bottom sample is based on it, but the letters (serifs
    in particular) have been re-drawn, apparently by hand. (Loss of short-term memory
    is a terrible thing -- if I am not actually looking at both samples at the same
    time -- I can't tell how similar they are.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
