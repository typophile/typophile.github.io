  like it would be a pretty common font and I've seen it all over the place in different
  designs, but can't find out the name of it.  I have a similar freeware font called
  Neo Retro Fill, but it is a distressed version of the clean, sans serif font that
  I want.  The image posted contains a text sample of Neo Retro Fill with two examples
  of the \"regular\" version of the font underneath.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize
  this font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font test 2_3700.JPG]"
