  body: "Hi -\r\n\r\nAs it happens, I just found Typophile by having a Google alert\r\nfor
    Caxton -- so I'll be exploring THIS site.  (As a Caxtonian,\r\nI spend some of
    my spare time looking for Caxton citations on the Internet).\r\n\r\nThe Caxton
    Club includes a wide range of folks interested in the history of printing, and
    so includes everyone from small press publishers and designers to collectors,
    scholars, and other lovers of the printed page. (The club also has members of
    the Manuscript Society; lovers, I suppose, of the scribbled page). In addition
    to our two meetings a month, the club publishes a monthly journal, both in hard
    copy and on our website. The Caxton Club is not formally affiliated with the Newberry
    Library, but several Caxtonians are Newberry staff members and we have a small
    administrative office in their premises.\r\n\r\nLast Wednesday we had a special
    meeting at the University of Chicago. One of our members, Kim Coventry, curated
    the current exhibit at the Regenstein Library drawn from the R.R. Donnelley archives.
    The exhibit might be characterized as the history of printing in the US as viewed
    through the history of the Donnelley company.  On November 15th our monthly dinner
    meeting (the third Wednesday) will hear a talk by Joseph Parisi, former editor
    of Poetry Magazine, on the subject of the 100 modern poems one might take to a
    desert island.\r\n\r\nWe hold an annual symposium in the spring. In April 2006,
    the subject was the history of copyright; the subject in 2007 will be translation.\r\n\r\nAs
    for this organization's interest, our preferred font is a Zipf, and the typophilic
    in the club with whom I'm most acquainted is Hayward Blake -- one of our distingished
    members.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has other questions or would like to attend a meeting,
    let me know. \r\n\r\nDan \"Skip\" Landt\r\nskiplandt@sbcglobal.net\r\nMembership
    Chair\r\n\r\n"
