  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys,

I have been working as the creative director of magazines (having recently joined a large magazine that comes as a supplement in a newspaper) for the past three years. I have just been promoted to creative director of the entire newspaper, which includes its broadsheet, a supplement and a separate magazine supplement that I have been creative director of.

As such, given my experience with magazines, a newspaper is quite the change. I recently redesigned the magazine as creative director of that, and that is the reason I have been promoted essentially. 

That's just some background. We are purchasing Type Together's Coranto 2 and LFT Etica as a serif-sans pair, but everyone seems to want to keep the masthead font, which is set in Utopia Display. I think it is really quite poor, but then that is probably because most mastheads on newspapers are essentially custom variations of fonts. But Utopia is not a font I like anyway, and it does look desperately generic. It just doesn't look nice.

Are there any fonts similar to Utopia, but with a bit of flare and originality (I know this is an oxymoron given I'm not a fan of Utopia) that could go and replace the masthead font? Or does anyone have any suggestions for one? It has to stay serif.

Your help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks.

		<div class="commentbody">Convert the existing masthead to outlines and carefully add some weight? Or hire a logo designer, or type designer, to tweak the masthead? 'm sure TypeTogether could do something nice. Or hire somebody else.

BTW, here is what I think is a good example from my own work of tweaking a font into a logo, where I started with TypeTogether's Adelle: http://blog.extensis.com/creative-fuel/brand-refresh-new-logo-decision-time.php (start about halfway down to see where things start to get some direction and come together).</div>
