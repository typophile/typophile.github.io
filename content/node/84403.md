  I\u2019m looking for suggestions of similar typefaces.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been looking
  at the angular serifs of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/etienne|Etienne]]
  by Tagir Safayev, but it\u2019s the  pointed tail of the uppercase \u2018R\u2019,
  and some other glyphs, in Mitim that has me sold on something closer to Pe\u0161ko\u2019s
  typeface.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nC"

  body: "Hi,\r\nthe pointed tail of the \u2018R\u2019 was probably inspired by this
    typeface:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/\r\n(see the description)\r\n\r\nAlso
    have a look at\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nother
    versions (?) of Romana at Myfonts in more weights:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/romana/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/romana/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/romana/"
