  body: ok, i have a customer who wants files he can use with suitcase 10.  Our fonts
    come in truetype and postscript, but he says he needs some special suitcase 10
    font format which is really standard, and that we relly should include with our
    fonts???? <BR> <BR>

  body: I don&#39;t know where the customer got the sfil file extension from, but
    it was bogus... there is no special font format needed for Suitcase 10. <BR> <BR>I
    downloaded a trial copy of Suitcase 10 and it all worked fine...  <BR> <BR>Jim
