  body: "It's very close to a Garamond, but not quite (e.g., Garamond's z has an upward
    pointing serif at the top vertical stroke, this sample does not).\r\n\r\nIt's
    also not Sabon or Bembo.\r\n\r\nI did a quick search on some of the Dutch type
    foundry sites, but didn't see a match on any of them, either."
