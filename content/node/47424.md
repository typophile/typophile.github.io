  body: Most likely hand lettered. [[Apply Design]]'s <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?BOJ">Merz</a>
    is an homage but lacks the jaunty 'E'.

  body: It was digitized sometime in the nineties (I guess) as <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/list_fontfamily.cfm/family/Merz/">Merz</a>.

  body: The MERZ was originally taken by Schwitters from the logotype of the COMMERZBANK
    (a German bank firm), if i remember correctly; it was not a typeface.

  body: The first appearance of "MERZ" in Schwitters' work was indeed a collaged bit
    from an advertisement of the KOMMERZ- UND PRIVATBANK ("Merzbild," 1919), but it
    did not use the tall grotesque letters that he used for the masthead of his journal
    (which began four years later).
