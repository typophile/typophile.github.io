    OpenType features are operating on glyphs names. But you will lose access to alternate
    glyphs in applications, which are not OT-savvy so it's a good practice to put
    them somewhere in Unicode's Private Use Area."

    creating a bogus encoding a good idea is a question that has long been the subject
    of heated debate. Adobe, for example, used to do this religiously in all Adobe
    OpenType fonts, but we finally decided to discontinue the practice in new fonts
    starting with Arno and Hypatia Sans (IIRC, I personally pushed that move).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thomas, I wouldn't call it a *bogus* encoding, but a private one. So, for
    fonts having a quite restricted audience, private use encodings make sense; for
    a font to be generally released to the public, probably not. \r\n\r\nFor example,
    the medievalists with \"Junicode\" have essentially proposed a standardized private
    use encoding for some characters they need that will never have regular Unicode
    numbers. And our company, in our working fonts, gives all ornaments a Private
    Use encoding, on the grounds that it alerts an eventual user of the files that
    there is something in them they need to check, but if they don't and the characters
    drop out, no real harm is done to the text.\r\n\r\nI'd agree that for an alternate
    glyph, it is best not to use the PUA. The situation with Type 1 fonts was a similar
    conundrum, where characters outside the MAC or WIN standard name-based encodings
    were given the wrong name just to be included in the font. Any further use of
    a file that employed such alternates was a PITA.\r\n\r\nWith the multiple uses
    of a (single) text file today, a layout program that has to treat alternate glyphs
    as different characters -- different objects -- probably just should not have
    access to them. Font designers should understand that their product is not an
    end in itself; to have value it needs to be used. For those of us who use type,
    a certain consistency across fonts is important. The object-attribute model of
    OpenType helps with this; letting the features code give whatever typographic
    niceties the font designer wishes to include, while preserving the text file.
    Font designers shouldn't then take away what that gains us."

  body: "If the alternate glyph represents a character that has not been encoded in
    Unicode on its own (nor it can be represented as a sequence of Unicode characters),
    but it has different SEMANTICS that the \"basic\" variant, and if you want this
    different semantics to be preserved when the text is extracted/searched in an
    electronic document (PDF), then you should use a PUA value and use glyph names
    like <code>uniXXXX</code> where XXXX is the PUA Unicode codepoint. \r\n\r\nIf
    the alternate glyph represents a visual variant of a basic character but semantically
    it still is the same character, you should not use PUA and use glyph names like
    <code>basicglyphname.suffix</code>. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
