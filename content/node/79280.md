  name of it. This screenshot is from \"F for Fake\", a mid-70's documentary by Orson
  Welles. Great movie, great type\u2026 I just need to know what it is. The distinctive
  'S','R', and 'E' should be dead giveaways, but I can't ID this one. Can anyone help?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n- Jeff\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.sportcasual.com/misc/text.png\">\r\n\r\n"
