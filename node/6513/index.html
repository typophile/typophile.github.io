  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This is the very beginnings of this font - still need to create the Uppercase but sorting out the lower case first. The letters that have been bugging me are &#34;a&#34; &#34;c&#34; &#34;e&#34; &#34;s&#34; and I need to create more ligature style ones. I didn&#39;t mean it to end up looking this &#34;jumpy&#34; but I&#39;m going with it now. I also want to create 3 more weights but this is just to get the &#34;skeleton&#34; of the font right. <BR> <BR>This is a screen grab from Illustrator if it looks a bit ropey &#40;although that may just be the typeface!&#41; <BR> <BR>Feedback, thoughts, hints, advice etc. are all more then welcome and would be appreciated!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48117.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like this &#40;especially as white on black&#41;. <BR> <BR>Some suggestions: I think the tail of the &#39;q&#39; looks out of place next to all those tight little curves on the other letters -- perhaps if the curve had a smaller radius like the &#39;l&#39;? <BR> <BR>I like the funky round shape you have going on in the o, p, q, b, etc. So re your question about a, c, e, s, I think the c is fine overall &#40;maybe some tinkering with the aperture&#41; and the shape of the e is fine, with the exception of the middle horizontal piece. &#40;Sorry I don&#39;t know my type anatomy better.&#41; I think if it was more horizontal, or even inclined the other way, it would be an improvement.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Cheers for that advice - I&#39;m going to try the Horizontal on the &#34;e&#34; so it slopes the other way - don&#39;t know what you mean about the aperture on the &#34;c&#34; as I haven&#39;t got the first clue about type anatomy! I need to make it look less &#34;hand drawn&#34; somehow - I think that&#39;s down to getting the &#34;e&#34; and the &#34;s&#34; correct when I look at the words below...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Aperture means opening -- all I meant was that it seems your &#39;c&#39; is basically the same as your &#39;o&#39; with a little section erased. In other words you might want to tinker with what part of the the &#39;o&#39; you erase for the opening. IMHO I might make the opening a little larger. <BR> <BR>Or, alternatively, you could use the &#34;mirror image&#34; of the &#39;o&#39; as your starting point for the &#39;c&#39;, as it seems you did on the &#39;p&#39; and &#39;b&#39;. It&#39;s hard for me to picture whether that would look good or bad though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, <BR>reallly nice, somehow classic and playful at the same time. <BR>But I agree partly with you on your first observation, at least on the c, e and s. In my, very layman-ish, opinion, the problem with the c and the e is that they slope downwards, the c on the upper stroke, the e on the horizontal piece.  <BR> <BR>As for the s, I&#39;d say that it needs a bit broader base </div>
