  any bells?\r\nIt's from a 1988 advert for Mercedes S Class.\r\nBernhard Fashion
  comes close, save for the rounded edges and the R and S letterforms.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be much appreciated.\r\nThanks!"

    it look handmade."

  body: Another similar typeface is House Neutraface Display Drafting Alt. The 'E's
    and 'M' are really close, though I agree yours looks like the hand lettered architect's/landscape
    architect's style I learned in school.

    not a perfect match, but it got the prominent S and rounded curves.\r\n"
