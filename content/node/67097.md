    no idea how to turn it off. :-)

    not much of mine to block anyway, I'm a lurker here. But I saw trollish/boring/tedious
    behavior by certain individuals, hence the GM script.\r\n\r\nI will move the thread
    to the appropriate sub-forum."

    subtract people from, and they will be hidden only on YOUR computer with the script
    installed. That, and nobody will know who you have in your list.'

    this script to vanish posts from someone,\r\nand they figure out that you are
    not reading them\r\n(because, for example, you make yourself look silly\r\nby
    saying things they'd already shown to be stupid),\r\nthey will be able to say
    lots of things that show you\r\nto be stupid and you won't have the slightest
    idea...\r\n\r\ni'm just sayin'...\r\n\r\nas the saying goes, \r\nkeep your friends
    close...\r\nand your enemies even closer...\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n"
