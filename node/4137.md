body: Not that we really need yet another humanist sans &#40;although this was a custom
  job, so maybe it&#39;s OK&#41;, but Underware&#39;s recent Stool has some nice features,
  like an italic with serifs! And the presentation is great &#40;no surprise&#41;.

  body: Not all are. Minion&#39;s small caps are exactly the same height as the s-height.
    It looks rather odd, somewhat too cute.
