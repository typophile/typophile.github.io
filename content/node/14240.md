    Kabel Ultra</strong></a> is sorta close.\r\n\r\nI found a closer match in an old
    Photo-Lettering, Inc. sample book, but the typeface is referenced by a number
    and not a name.\r\n\r\nParker Bros., originally in Salem, Mass., had a big in-house
    design and ad agency in its heyday. The game \"Clue\" probably pre-dates ITC which
    was founded in 1970, so if the game graphics hasn't been updated since then, it
    was probably done on using photo headline font.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

    kind of Clue-themed game on her floor at school. So Kabel Ultra should work just
    fine."
