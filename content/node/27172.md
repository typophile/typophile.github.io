  body: 'The numerals you&#39;re looking for are included as an additional  <BR>weight
    with a &#34;LF&#34; suffix &#40;Lining Figures&#41;. As for the naming: <BR>there
    is only one Scala Sans available, and it&#39;s FF Scala Sans  <BR>from FontFont.
    You won&#39;t find a Scala Sans without the FF prefix.'
