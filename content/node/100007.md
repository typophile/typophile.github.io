  body: "Obviously that depends on the link!  :-/\r\n\r\nIn fact it's better to provide
    a link to a legitimate font, because with just a name the chances of looking for
    and finding a pirated/plagiarized version go up a great deal.\r\n\r\nNever forget
    about the people making the effort to create these things; they also happen to
    be the people who made this place.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
