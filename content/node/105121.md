  But there are some interesting problems and discussions there. Maybe you should
  make that a regular stop. http://www.typophile.com/forum/28  They'll treat you right
  down there!\r\n\r\nForum designers, much of the stuff that gets posted there could
  also be in the Design Forum. Maybe you could consider this if there is a change
  in the website."
