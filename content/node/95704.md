  applications I use most.  Don't worry they're for personal use. I just want as unified
  a look as possible on my desktop. Sorry about the color.  The icons are all sorts
  of grays.  That's  why I want them.  You really have to see them in action.  There's
  some color text the Photoshop, Dreamweaver and Stuffit ones.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tab_3511.jpg]"
