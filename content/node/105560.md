  body: "Designed Hans M\xF6hring as Gabriele for W\xF6llmer Type Foundry in 1938
    or 1947.  Here is a specimen from Weber, 1947, from Jaspert's _Type Encyclopedia_
    [1970]:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jaspert379Gabriele_4439.jpg]\r\nThe
    only digital version AFAIK is <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/g/gabrielle.htm\">Gabrielle
    </a> -- note double l -- by  Dieter Steffmann.\r\nThe legitmacy of Steffmann's
    Gabrielle was discussed a couple of years ago: http://typophile.com/node/87124.
    The consensus seems to have been that it is as \"legitimate\" as you're going
    to get.\r\nDon\r\n"
