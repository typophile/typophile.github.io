    by Timo Gaessner.\r\n\r\nBy the way: If you spot a webfont on a site, you can
    always check the source code to find out what it is. There are plugins to assist
    you with that, but in Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome you can simply select
    some letters of the typeface that you want to know, make a right click on them
    and select \u2018Inspect element\u2019. The specifications of the element will
    be shown in the bottom right corner of the screen."
