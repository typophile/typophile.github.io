body: I use Optima as the default for my web browser and email proportional fonts.
  I find it so readable and pleasant that I am surprised it is not ubiquitous as a
  screen font. Am I missing something?

    wanted a clean san serif face - Optima fit the bill. Easy to read and it allows
    more characters per line than Helvetica. Great point when you are trying to fit
    articles on a page.\r\n\r\nIt's been around a long time, and well, it's just well
    drawn. Only regret -- I hate the commas and quote marks! Wish they had given some
    thought to the design of them..."

    wouldn't have done it justice. If you like Optima check out Gary Munch's new Candara

  body: "(I will preface this by saying that I happily use digital type 95% of the
    time, and am not one to say that letterpress composition is <em>always</em> better
    . . . it depends so much on the nature of the individual job, the typeface chosen,
    and who the comp and printer are. That said, I do feel lucky that I get to use
    metal in some of my work.)\r\n\r\nI have a copy of Zapf's <em>Manuale Typographicum</em>
    (the later, 1968 edition published with MIT Press) which is set in many dozens
    of different types. The Optima pages in this book have a kind of noble and magical
    radiance that I have never experienced in offset reproductions of the type, whether
    from VIP or 202 or later digital typesetting. Maybe the impression accentuates
    or highlights the subtle swellings of the strokes in some way. Whatever it is,
    the sure gives that type <em>presence</em>.\r\n\r\nOptima seems to garner more
    fierce pro and con statements than most designs. I can remember one of my favorite
    art directors in the 1980s talking about characteristics of the quintessential
    client from h*ll, and saying in tones of disgust: \"Yeah, you know, the kind of
    person whose sister-in-law went to art school and she loves Optima!!\" "

    Patty spoke of just looks flat out anemic to me. I just never understood the fasination
    nor the overuse of it. I used to call it spayed Roman. It always seemed to have
    the worst of both the sans and the serif faces instead of the opposite which was
    the intention. Sorry Herman, I just can't see using that one.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS:

  body: "I misspell my own name too :-)\r\n\r\nThe difference is that I don't like
    the Roman Palatino either and feel the sans does not look a bit like it--maybe
    that is why it looks better to me. With the sans, there was a commitment to making
    it work as a sans. Optima just doesn't fall enough either way to work for me.
    Beorcana does a much better job of it. It is more gutsy than Optima and looks
    like it should hold up well under text use.\r\n\r\nI don't blame Zapf as much
    for the problems with Optima as I do the technology change. As noted by Muzz,
    it can work when set well in hot metal. When first translated to phototype, they
    must have just used the drawings uncorrected for photo and offset. I am sure Herman(n)
    worked from hot metal proofs to finalize his drawings and figured in inkspread
    in his design. When you take phototype (moreso with dirty lenses) you weaken the
    marginalness of Optima to begin with. Then you put it in front of a Robertson
    to shoot film and it degrades more. Next step, platemaking where someone gets
    heavyhanded with the rouge--add light ink on an offset press and bingo, the poor
    thing is dead. Pressman were trying to hold it from plugging and yet keep the
    color even.  Ask an oldschool pressman running 6pt Optima on an old offset press
    how much fun it was (then ask him how printing a reverse was). Early digital type
    (and Optima was one of the first) didn't remedy much if any. I am glad the Nova
    version has moved it towards the better.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: I don't know
    why LinoType named the sans version Palatino at all unless they were looking at
    it purel;y as a marketing thing to cash in on the name recognition of the roman
    original. They should have just named it Zapf Sans or some such thing."

    Beorcana is more gutsy, and will be better for many uses, but it's hard to beat
    the elegance of line and proportion in Optima. "
