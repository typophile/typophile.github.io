    <BR>The ampersand from Oneleigh Italic &#40;left&#41; was inspired by, among other
    things, the Monotype Garamond ampersand &#40;right&#41;, something Les Usherwood
    once said about the ampersand beign a character he liked to get his teeth into
    &#40;or words to that effect&#41;, and of course all those pages people used to
    put together showing ampersands from a variety of fonts. '

    that sometimes his types are appealing for their individual glyphs <BR>rather

    of this for me. It&#39;s certainly not <i>always</i> the case.
