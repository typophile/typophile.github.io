  so I'm hoping the General Discussion forum is appropriate for this post.\r\n\r\nAs
  the topic suggests, I'm looking for an online printer that people have used and
  would recommend. I'm looking to have some personal business cards printed, specifically,
  I am looking for spot-varnish capabilities and possibly rounded corners. Spot-varnish
  being the more important printing feature I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nAlso, because
  I'm new to the whole printing scene I'm wondering if you guys could maybe give me
  a rundown on picking a card stock? I notice most sites have card-stock rated by
  a 'gsm' number. I'm assuming the higher the number the thicker the stock? I'm looking
  for something fairly thick... any recommendations?\r\n\r\nAlso, seeing as I want
  a spot-varnish, is there a specific type of card stock you would recommend?\r\n\r\nThanks
  to everyone in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: You should explore your local options. Most online print is 4C. Find a shop
    that works with small quantities. A local printer will be able to talk paper stock
    and may have something they are already familiar with and used to working with.
    A varnish is going to need a coated stock more to the glossy end.

    would be I'd learn a lot more about printing for future projects...\r\n\r\nOn
    that note though, and I'll just throw this out there... Does anyone know of small
    print shops worth checking out in Toronto?\r\n\r\n"
