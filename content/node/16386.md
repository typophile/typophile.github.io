  body: "I, too, was looking for this font.  Although you all mentioned that it was
    custom work, I was wondering if anyone could please recommend a font that appears
    to be similiar.  I am currently doing a parody project, and it would be great
    if I could find something that is relatively similar.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Brian"

  body: It has a passing resemblance to Korinna Kursiv or Benguiat, but neither of
    those is even very close. I can't think of a font that would be closer. (This
    is a good example of why people use custom lettering as part of branding. It makes
    it a bit harder to imitate.)

  body: "Mark,\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions.  Those fonts definitely fit the
    bill for my project.  As the saying goes, \"close enough for government work.\"
    ...or my work, for that matter!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I appreciate your input.\r\n-Brian"
