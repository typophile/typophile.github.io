  body: I think a version of Modern Extended like e.g. <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Elsner%2BFlake&ffam=ModernExtendedEF%20Book%20-%20Regular&fid=a7fe3311fb67458f691ff5aa671477b8&fsize=48&text=John%20Baird%20Considering%20how%20well%20accepted%20Muswell%20Alexandra%20Palace&wrap=2|Modern
    Extended EF Book]]</strong> or <strong>Monotype Modern</strong> would be very
