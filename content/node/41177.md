  back, we had a discussion (and even a demo, if I remember correctly) regarding ornate
  \"spirograph\" patterns created in Illustrator, such as you might find on currency
  or certificates. Anyone remember the thread? I've done about a dozen searches.\r\nThanks!"

  body: "From my history there are these:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/30432 and http://typophile.com/node/20517\r\n\r\nAs
    far as Tutorials: the best I can suggest at this point is, using simple lines
    and the Object>Blend tool, you can achieve some rather basic but similar effects.
    layering these effects can create a more complicated looking design. Also, you
    might be able to use the pattern brush to create a border as well. It'll just
    take some experimenting to get the desired effect. Also, remember lines in a blend
    can be manipulated (either adding points, curves or even changing the position.)\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps."

  body: Try Object/Transform/Scale (or whatever) and Copy in transform . Thus one
    curve becomes many and can be scaled, slanted etc .  Command D repeats the transformation.

  body: "thanks, guys.\r\n\r\nthere was actually a pretty longish thread before, and
    a lot of people had some great tips on using the blend to create the patterns.
    but, like i said, i can't find the precise node. but i do appreciate your ideas;
    i didn't know about the plugin."
