    have been a real manuscript = written by hand = manu scriptum. Typewriters were
    used at that time by only very few authors, for instance by Nietzsche. For samples,
    also of paper size, see here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stephan-guenzel.de/Texte/Guenzel_Nietzsche-SM.pdf\r\n"

  body: "Marvellous to see the illustrations of Nietzsche's typewriter script. \r\n\r\nWith
    regard to the presentation of the thesis, I am not so sure that it could be presented
    in any of the ways proposed at the time of WW1. Certainly, in the 1930s, in America,
    at Columbia, a doctoral thesis was only considered presentable when printed in
    book form by, for example, no fooling, and entirely coincidentally, Columbia University
    Press. The expense entailed ($500? a small fortune in those days) delayed, sometimes
    for years, the awarding of doctorates to impecunious candidates, some well known
    to me. I would be surprised to learn that things were any less strict under the
    German system just a decade or two earlier. Certainly the American system was
    draconian to an extreme, and was gradually abandoned.  "

    I think in early 20th century Europe it would have been not exorbitant to produce
    a letterpress piece of modest length for something so significant in a person's
    life (it's not like today where they hand out PhDs for money and some time invested
    - back then you had to <em>invent</em> something).\r\n\r\nIn any case, the important
    thing is that it be in blackletter.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hmm... A chemistry PhD might not have been set in blackletter, Hrant (if it
    was typeset at all...). Didn't many in the sciences publish in serif typefaces?
    Before WWI, there were vigorous debates as to whether German should be set in
    Fraktur or serif typefaces. This implies to me that quite a lot of content was
    being printed in serif type. Otherwise, the discussion would not have been a big
    one.

  body: "I see two options that I have also seen examples of while working in a digitisation
    project at the local university library: \r\n<ul><li>handwritten with latin script,
    the acknowledgements and preface being handwritten in current script (not necessarily
    S\xFCtterlin, but something similar); those were considered not to be part of
    the scientific text, which of course had to be in latin script. \r\nThe sample
    I have seen was produced on an empty notebook of about 40 pages without rules,
    ca. 15x25cm. My guess for this choice in this case is the high number of formulas
    in the text (which was a mathematical dissertation if I remember correctly), and
    probably also a question of money.</li><li>typoscript. While not everyone had
    a typewriter ready at hand in the 1900-1910\u2019s, there used to be quite a remarkable
    number of \"writing offices\" where you could get your stuff typed from manuscript
    and/or from dictating it to one of the (usually relatively young and well-educated,
    both male and female) typewriter operators. Think of the number of internet caf\xE9s
    these days for a comparison (of course this is not really a parallel development,
    but the idea is that some new technique is invented, not everyone uses it at home
    or can't afford it, suddenly someone offers it as a service).\r\nIllustrations
    and/or formulae would still be handdrawn/written even in typed dissertations.
    I have seen an example from 1912 from the field of philosophy.</li></ul>\r\nWhich
    option was chosen might not only have been dependent from money issues, but also
    from the requirements the university needed you to fulfil. If you had to hand
    in several copies, it would have been easier and faster to type them or let them
    be typed by someone else because you could do carbon copies more easily than with
    handwritten things (still possible, but I have never seen a carbon copy of some
    60 sheets of a dissertation in handwriting in any university library). \r\nThe
    number of formulae would also have played a role, so depending on which specific
    field and application your hypothetical chemistry doctoral candidate would chose
    her/his options with regard to several other factors (money, having a typewriter
    or having the possibility to use one in e.g. some relative\u2019s office, number
    of copies requested by the local university administration, \u2026). "
