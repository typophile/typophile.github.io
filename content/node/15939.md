    future. even with this image you provided, whatthefont found the two digits "0"
    and "5" and decided the font would be FF DIN (which is right, as pattyfab already
    said). its a really easy to use tool and it helps in so many cases.'

    of the cheering would come from Yves's direction since he nails so many so quickly
