    Aside from the adbusters and Utne reader crowd, almost nobody has\u2014or will\u2014see
    this stuff, and given the way people like to shop, I don\u2019t think that they
    want to. Anti-consumerism is an echo chamber, not a dialogue being had by the
    masses."

    after Thanksgiving. People were rallying around and protesting in the middle of
    Westlake Center, a mall in the heart of downtown. They were carrying signs that
    said \"buy more stuff!\" etc.\r\n\r\nI was like, \"Yeah! Consumerism sucks!\"
    but then I walked around them because I needed to get to the sale at Guitar Center."

  body: I was looking specifically at 'I shop therefore I am'. Do you not think it
    is looking into the female obsession of shopping? All these anti- aging cream
    adverts to make them beautiful etc. Is she not mocking consumerism and its link
    to females?

  body: Is there by any chance a thread on here or an article on females and how they
    shop and buy? And as to why they shop obsessively (handbags, million pairs of
    shoes etc). Her work was pinched by Debenhams. This is what I have heard but can
    not seem to find the evidence online. Hmmm...I wonder if anyone on here knows
    about this and could guide me.

  body: "<em>Is she mocking and being ironic? Is that not obvious?</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    phrase \"I shop therefore I am\" is not a mockery of consumerism, but a recognition
    of it as a cultural imperative. Her important early work, after all, comes soon
    after the development of cultural studies as an academic discipline. The idea
    of \"popular culture\" was an oxymoron until around 1970.\r\nThe graphic style
    she used was not an imitation of commercial media. It had something in common,
    certainly, in the image+text combination, and Futura and color bars were popular
    at the time. But that was her style (she had worked in publishing), and also had
    resonance with, of course, John Heartfield's work--another artist who worked as
    a commercial graphic designer.\r\nIt was her medium, her way of expressing herself,
    not a parody."

    would also like to mention that he said that Debenhams ripped it off her, without
    any consent etc. Could that create a link to shopping somehow?\r\nEveryone else:
    Thank you for taking my question seriously. I wanted to see if there was a link
    or a connection could derive from a female approach to shopping, 'I shop therefore
    I am' and consumerism. Any ideas? I am trying to create a connection as part of
    my dissertation. "

  body: "Kruger had an exhibition in Glasgow in 2005, commissioned by GoMA, specifically
    related to violence against women, in her classic agitprop text+image technique:\r\nhttp://www.studio-international.co.uk/reports/kruger.asp\r\n\r\nIf
    you're looking to discuss sexual politics in her work, why not choose that, where
    she directly addresses the issue?\r\nI wouldn't say she particularly addresses
    consumerism in her work, although her use of commercial media may give that impression.\r\n\r\nBarabara
    Kruger is one of that generation of \"second wave\" feminists, and there's no
    denying that sexual politics is an important element in her work, but I would
    echo Ricardo in saying that there's more to it than that, and ironically by focusing
    on it and pigeonholing her as a consumerism/shopping/women's issues artist, you'd
    be missing the point. \r\n\r\nI like what she has to say, and the way she puts
    words and images together.\r\n\r\nAt the same time and place as the GoMA exhibit,
    she showed a more recent direction, an installation (four walls of an enormous
    room in an old transport terminal) involving four simultaneously screened movies
    of \"talking heads\" she had written and directed, with text captions.\r\n"

  body: I know that Kruger mocked masculinity in most of her work because she was
    a feminist but the 'I shop therefore I am' was a piece she did where she was cynical
    of women. Is she two faced then? She just mocks both men and women?

    for pointing that out. I wish it was pointed out well before the 19th but nevermind.
    I know Kruger did the work of I Shop Therefore I am but did they have permission
    to use it? It was bastardised. That's not what my tutor told me. Hmm...I wonder.
