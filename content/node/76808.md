body: "We've created a hand drawn script for an ad campaign and our client now wants
  us to create a typeface for the brand. It's a loose brush script with character
  variations. It will be drawn out (with an alternate case), cleaned up and traced.
  General kerning will be considered and it will include a standard punctuation set.\r\n\r\nWe
  need someone who can do the technical work and create the typeface for us in the
  best possible format for use on Mac and PC. Is there anyone out there who can do
  this or point us in the right direction?\r\n"
