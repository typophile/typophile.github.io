body: "I'm trying to identify a font on Paperless Post that they call \"Vendome Light\"
  / \"Vendome.\" This font is not your traditional Vendome as it is sans-serif and
  not serif like the original.\r\n\r\nI think it could be a preexisting font that
  they just changed the name of, but I can't figure it out. \r\nThere are certainly
  similarities to Gotham, but the middle line of the \"E\" on this font does not extend
  all the way and is cut short, unlike Gotham. \r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    Gothic</a> to me. If you need a very similar appearance, but more weights, have
    a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/sweet_sans/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=36&sample_text=VENDOME%20(LIGHT)&ft=liga">Sweet
