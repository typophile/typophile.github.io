  must embody a Medieval spirit. For font choices the previous designer started with
  Gryphius for body copy (which I think will work) and a blackletter font for the
  headers. For titling and subheads I'm open to also considering a more Celtic Uncial
  style but want it to 1) have a bit of a soft or crumbling edge and 2) maintain legibility
  since it will be read on screen, so the counters can't be too narrow and pinched
  looking. I'm considering Brokenscript and Canterbury but not crazy about either
  of them. Any ideas? Thanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gryphius_3557.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brokenscript_3762.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Canterbury_5948.png]"

  body: Thanks, Igino. Still looking for a calligraphic font for titling (a legible
    blackletter, or uncial, or Lombardic) and think I've settled on Gryphius for the
    body copy. But it's great to see what you're up to.
