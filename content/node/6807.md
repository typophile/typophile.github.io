body: In <em>[[Anatomy of a Typeface]]</em> it talks about how this face was never
  produced by Monotype and gives some sketches. I'm wondering have been any typefaces
  based on this lettering?

    rate, here&#39;s the image from <i>Anatomy</i> p. 331. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/49613.gif"

  body: '&#39;If you don&#39;t get your type warm it will be just a smooth, commonplace,
    third-rate piece of good machine technique - no use at all for setting down warm
    human ideas - just a box full of rivets... By jickity, I&#39;d like to make a
    type that fitted 1935 all right enough, but I&#39;d like to make it warm - so
    full of blood and personality that it would jump at you.&#39; From Dwiggins&#39;

  body: I know I have this image somewhere in my notes but I can&#39;t seem to find
    it. I agree with Thomas, this is heavily bent toward Optima. I can&#39;t remember
    when he drew these. Can you make any dates out Paul? I don&#39;t have my copy
    here at work. Optima however was designed &#40;completed&#41; in 1958, and Dwiggins
    died in 1956. His hand was not so sure toward the end of his life because of his
    diabetes so this must be at least from the 30s early 40s. Myfonts mentions that
    Optima was designed to compete with Ludwig &amp; Mayers Colonia. I wonder when
    that face was completed. Does anyone know? Can anyone post an image of that?

    these drawings are now in The Cary Collection. Anyone know where/what that is?
    Any ideas on how to get facsimilies of original drawings?

  body: If I remember my Caligraphy correctly &#40;it has been 42 years&#41;, the
    Dwiggins sample you posted looks like a variant on Simplehand Roman.  The proportions
    are different though.  Simplehand was a true Roman proportioned writing.  The
    Dwiggins above is much more monoproportioned. The &#34;o&#34; and &#34;e&#34;
    are quite narrow for Roman proportion but strangely the &#34;g&#34; is wider.
    <BR>Actually Thomas has a point as well since Lydian looks a lot like Simplehand
    as well <BR> <BR>ChrisL
