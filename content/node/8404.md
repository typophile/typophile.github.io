  body: Some Googling came up with this <a href="http://www.linotype.com/7-600-7/waltertracy.html"
    target="_blank">profile of Walter Tracy</a>, who designed a couple of fonts for
    the Daily Telegraph. &#39;Telegraph Modern&#39; and &#39;Telegraph Newface&#39;
    are both mentioned, but not linked &#40;not Linotype faces, and maybe not commercially
    available -- I haven&#39;t looked for them yet, but I will.&#41;

  body: Some other information I found made it sound as if Linotype Modern = <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-880/modern-880/testdrive.html?s=These+boots+made+for+gawping&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">Modern 880</a> = Telegraph Modern, but it is not identical to
    your sample. There are similarities, so I&#39;d guess it is some variant of a
    Modern.
