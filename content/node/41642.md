body: "\"I was presschecking a job in Montreal recently and discovered Gravure Choquet
  Inc.I have never encountered such a clean, well-maintained shop. They specialize
  in letterpress, embossing (sculptured and flat) and foil stamping.\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThis
  was something posted by Ken Bessie several months ago ... I was wondering if he
  or anyone else has seen the kind of work Gravure Choquet Inc. in Montreal has done?
  do they print invitations? Are their results of good quality?\r\n\r\nAlso, does
  anyone know of a good letterpress shop in Calgary? I would need polymer plates made,
  not hand set type ... so I can have more control over the design. I'm in Montreal,
  but my clients are in Calgary ... It's my first time designing for letterpress and
  I'm not sure if I should physically be in the same city as the printer or whether
  it will be fine to have it printed somewhere else?"

    in Saint-Henri with hand set metal and wood type and a linotype machine. He doesn't
    have the equipment for polymer plates but he may know some folks here in Montreal
    who has it\u2026\r\n\r\nalex"

    plates -- I can call my friend there and ask on Monday, if you like (email me
    if you want her number directly), and I'm pretty sure Sundog does as well.\r\n\r\nDoesn't
    matter where you get it printed, so long as you (and presumeably the client) do
    a press check -- do they want to go to Montreal or do you want to come here?  We've
    got less snow....  ;-)"
