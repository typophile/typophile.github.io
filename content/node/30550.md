body: "Moderating this board is lots of work -- mostly behind the scenes -- and eats
  up large amounts of my own time. Remember this is a voluntary job. I don't get paid
  for this, and time spent here is time I can't devote to my family, writing for Unzipped
  or Typographer.org or other websites, designing for my personal clients, rehearsing
  and gigging with my band Troubleman or -- hey -- <em>relaxing</em>.\r\n\r\nI don't
  mind doing this, make no mistake. Fact is, I even like it. But if you want a typeface
  identified or need advice or information, <em>please don't send me a personal e-mail.</em>
  Post it here, that's what this board is all about.\r\n\r\nThank you. ;^)"

    e-mail me personally, I <em>will</em> help you in person if and when I can. But

    not contacting moderators directly with questions about type IDs, but posting
    them to the list. Thanks for your generous efforts!'

    even happen, work and run smoothly. This place would be nothing as close to what
    it is, without your effort and passion.\r\n\r\nDav"

    from me too."
