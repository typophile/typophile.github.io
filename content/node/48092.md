  within the text, but I can't seem to find it, or anything similar.\r\n\r\nI've attached
  some pics from the web, but they're not great so apologies for that.\r\nAny help
  will be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nT"

    certainly going to keep that in mind for future projects.\r\nSchreibmaschine Regular
    is the exact font I was looking for, thanks James you're a star.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "This is just great. Somebody posts pictures where you can't make out a damn
    thing, then somebody else identifies the exact font by name.\r\n\r\nJust a few
    things to consider:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\"Schreibmaschinen-Schriften\" is just
    German for \"typewriter faces\", thus hardly a distinguishing name.</li>\r\n<li>Contrary
    to popular belief, most typewriter faces weren't specific to certain typewriter
    models. You could have different fonts on one model, just like today on your computer,
    only the changing of the font was a bit more difficult (it would have included
    soldering, so you chose one font when purchasing the machine and then were basically
    stuck with it). As far as I know though, Olivetti <em>did</em> have some exclusive
    typefaces on some of their machines.</li>\r\n<li>The Linotype \"Schreibmaschine
    Regular\" cannot possibly be the face in question, because Linotype produced composing
    machines, not typewriters. At best they would have some makebelieve typewriter
    faces on their machines to mimick a hand-typed letter.</li>\r\n<li>Linotype's
    \"Schreibmaschine Regular\" probably came to their Library via Berthold's \"Schreibmaschinenschrift
    BQ\" which looks identical. Berthold also didn't produce typewriters, so go figure
    if it's a real typewriter face ...</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nWhy do I bother at all?
    When it comes to typewriter faces, I just can't help it ... now does anybody have
    a <em>recognizable</em> picture of the typeface in question ... you really got
    me interested ;)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nJens"

    earth did you expect anyone to identify this typeface from those pictures? I mean,
    there is <em>no way</em> you can make out even a single character.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/27c9eb6709a0336172bf1110_6111.L.jpg]"
