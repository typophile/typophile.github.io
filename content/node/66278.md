  body: "It must have come and gone fairly quickly. None of the Letraset catalogs
    or brochures I have (and I have lots, going back to the Seventies) shows it. \r\n\r\nI
    only was able to ID it because it's listed in Dan X. Solo's catalog. Letraset
    was never in the film font business (as far as I know), yet all their fonts wound
    up in film font libraries."

  body: Thingy said it was in a Letraset catalog from 1974. I've got a lot of old
    Letraset catalogs and brochures from back then, but not one that shows Turtle.
    Apparently, Thingy has (or had) one.
