I was asking 'why' in the big-picture/rhetorical/"if it ain't broke..." sense.

I can't comprehend any business argument for Wal-Mart rebranding itself with that small of a shift...or, for that matter, ANY rebranding. They are what they are and they're the biggest retailer on the planet. Why bother with a rebrand?

Because among non-Walmart customers, Walmart is one of the most detested brands around. Walmart’s domestic growth has been stagnating for years because Walmart stores have become persona non grata in many communities, and across America municipalities have been rewriting zoning laws to keep big box retailers like Walmart and Home Depot from setting up shop. Here in DC Walmart announced it was going to open a store in the morning, and within hours the city government was plotting ways to keep Walmart out. By the end of the day Walmart canceled plans for a store in DC. 

Walmart’s reliance on cheap Chinese goods to keep profits high is starting to hurt the company. Tainted pet foods and toys slathered in lead paint have made it much harder to defend that business model. Politicians and pundits blaming China for high gas prices isn’t helping. Neither is manipulating the hours worked by employees classified ”full-time” to avoid providing them with health insurance. Or discriminating against female employees. On the other side of the aisle Walmart is pissing off America’s religious extremists by adding gays to its anti-discrimination policy and making the company greener.

Walmart has a huge image problem that the people running it don’t know how to fix. It’s probably not one that even can be fixed. But they appear to believe that getting their brand out of backwoods of Arkansas is a start.</div>

Walmart has been pushing hard to go green since 2005-probably because they finally noticed how many millions of dollars McDonalds and Starbucks have saved by slashing waste. Have you noticed that most laundry detergent had its concentration doubled in the last few years? That was Walmart getting trucks off the road. The problem is that Walmart spent years courting the ignorant redneck crowd as a customer base, and taking steps to making the company green pisses off the anti-science crowd who want us to all know about how controversial global warming and evolution are. I can’t say I have much sympathy, that’s what Walmart gets for doing business in America’s cultural gutter.</div>

On the subject of big brand branding. Has anyone seen a new/revamped Target store where they've schooched the target up a bit, to hang over the edge of the wall/sign it's on? This drives me crazy! I always want to pull it back down.

And a new logo certainly isn't going to change that.

		<div class="commentbody"> I doubt that walmart will have much success reaching out to the utne reading, Prius driving segment of the population, but being a primium brand has never been their strategy. The logo is clearly a shout out to the rise of environmental consciousness in popular culture (see the rebrands of ge, philip morris/altria, and BP), and for wal-marts base of price oriented shoppers, a bit of gloss will go a long way in making them fell better about themselves for supporting a retailer whose treatment of their workers and the environment leaves little to celebrate.

My guess is that the new logo has less to do with a full greenwashing of the brand, but a signal of a more general physical downsizing.  Up until now walmart has sold itself as the agricultural wholesaler for the suburban lifestyle, placing giant stores in recently developed rural areas.  As energy prices rise and the middle class moves back to more densly populated areas, walmart needs to find a way to fit in to a more urban landscape.  This logo signals that shift.

I assume their plan is to put a greater focus on going after rite-aid and walgreens traditional turf of purchasing cheap properties in depressed and aging mid-century suburbs and putting in a big cube of retail/pharmacy.  So when people say the logo looks pharmaceutical, they are probably dead on.  In short, if you imagine the piece on the side of a Walmart, it definitely smacks of corporate doublespeak, but if you place the same on the side of a Walgreens, it looks a better fit. </div>

This is exactly what I thought. Could it have been any easier/lazier? The one logo retread I can think of that's more lame than this is the new [[http://www.oskarlin.com/images/chevron_01.png|Chevron logo,]] also using the safe and easily-available Myriad. They actually made signage with it and everything. Gak. I suppose we should be glad that the W is capitalized rather than made lowercase to give us all a cuddly, safe feeling. </div>

Ironically, I had been thinking about Wal-Mart just recently...about the name and how if it were at all possible, they should change/tweak it. I think there are just too many obstacles for the "Wal-Mart" brand>> i.e. negative stigmas, stereotypes and associations that have been made about the store within the pop culture (that's all branding too!). The only positive "brand attribute" they seem to have going for them is "cheap prices".

Since re-naming is probably out of the realm of possibility, I think changing the look is the next best hope for the company. However, the juvenile look of the proposed design doesn't seem to appropriately encompass the massive proportion of the brand. </div>

Wal-Mart didn't become Wal-Mart by paying well. ;o)

"If they sell donuts, I’m there."

They do. And I challenge you to eat even half of one. It's bad enough that Wal-Mart can destroy the grocery stores in small towns when they move in, but to add insult to injury, most of their food is rather inedible by anyone with even average taste buds.

		<div class="commentbody">r: Bryan:  Yes, they do sell donuts.  When I worked there (as there wasnt much else when I lived in Fl), I woke up at 3am to make them for just over $7 an hour.  It was the most detestable, demeaning place I have ever worked.  Which is saying a lot, as I worked at McDonalds for a long while as well before I finished school.  I was routinely shorted hours, etc.  As if killing myself for $7 an hour wasnt bad enough.
