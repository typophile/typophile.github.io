  please ID the typeface used in this infographic taken from the NY Times website.

    doesn't look like Franklin Gothin to me :s \r\n\r\nMaybe I'm rong..\r\n\r\n"

  body: hmmm... you are right. Sorry, too anxious. The smaller type could very well
    be Helvetica.

  body: "I think you already nailed it, you two.\r\n\r\nThe sample is small and it's
    hard to be 100% sure but I think the title is Franklin Gothic and body is Helvetica.
    Look at the numbers. They look very Helvetica to me.\r\n\r\nRegards"
