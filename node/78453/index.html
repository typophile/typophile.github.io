  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone, I'm pleased to be here, I love design, grammar, and font.  I'm a copy-editor by trade, but with a flare for aesthetics, I hope.  

I work at BC Children's Hospital.  For those who don't know, a quick Google Image search will reveal that most of their logos are designed to look like they're written by five year olds with Crayola products.  That's not a slight, that's their actual intent.  Crayons.  Their letterhead is made to look like it's written in crayon.  The signs of the departments outside my door has the same crayon motif.  

Now I've just inherited the job of updating this page:
http://www.bcchildrens.ca/Services/ClinicalDiagnosticFamilyServices/SocialWork/Forfamilies/Accommodation.htm

Something occurs to me; and I realize that saying so may or may not make me an instant pariah in this community, but I'm willing to make the bold statement to risk your contempt; I may have actually discovered an appropriate place for Comic Sans.  It goes along with their disarming appearance and child's script motif.  Is it even arguable that I should keep it that way, or will even the layman's sentiments about this font ruin the credibility of the information below?

Anyways, thanks everyone, and I hope to become a prolific part of this community.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone, good food for thought so far.  

In addition, for those who did that Google Image search: can you identify the font used below the sunshine-happyface logo?  I wonder if I should just go with that, to keep that part of the motif.</div>

Readers might wonder if the listing order within each section is random, or in order of desirability, or in order of closeness to your facility, or what.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Alright, improvements have been made, but some have been kaiboshed.  It sounds like it's part of their enforced design layout for all their pages to have the fonts and rough appearance involved, and so I don't have the authority to recommend another font.  Nevertheless, I'm goign to improve it every other way, and your advice has been very appreciated.  

Again, I hope to collaborate with the good people here often!</div>
