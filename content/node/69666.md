    will be easier for us to refer to certain logos.

  body: "Thanks Nikola.\r\nI kinda like #7. It has colours (design), it has N and
    J (maybe some curve would make it more distinguishable) letters inside. So yes.
    #7.\r\n\r\nApankrat makes a very good poing about #9 even though it seems very
    clean and professional. It actually does look very very similar."

  body: "Frankly, I don't think any of these work. They are all over the place.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the second from right in the second row of #1, but it too needs more work and
    refinement to add some substance, while keeping the simplicity. #3 is interesting,
    but I cannot shake off the impression that it's a common venture of Nikon and
    Minolta.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you very much Robert and everyone else for your opinion and advice.
    I really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nNo. 7 was my favorite but then I came to this...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NJlogo_5633.gif]\r\n\r\nIt's
    very simple, bold and flexible. I also wanted something that could be shrunk to
    a 16\xD716 favicon and survive. It's mission impossible to make something that
    everyone would love but I'm happy with it at the moment and I decided to use it
    so I can finally start developing my website etc. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\n
    \r\nDecision is made but I am still curious and your opinions are more then welcome. "

    it's not bad at all. Have you tried using the real J for the right part?"
