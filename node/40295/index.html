I am trying to put together an all-star classis/retro alphabet and I am very interested in some ideas from you. What is your favourite A, K, Ampersand etc.</p>
<p>Work in progress just did it <a href="http://www.workinprogressblog.com/?cat=11">http://www.workinprogressblog.com/?cat=11</a>, but I think it would be cool to make a better one, which shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, with a little help from all you expert fontheads : )</p>
<p>I enclosed a picture of the letters I have done so far, just to give you an idea of where I want to go with this, but it is very far from done.
As you can see, most of it is already custom-made, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to be an existing font. It can be a scan from an old magazine etc. Anything goes!</p>
<p>// Mark</p>

If i was using 20 or more different fonts in a design assignment, it wouldnt be illegal, and that would even be profitable which this project isn&rsquo;t.
The main reason I want to do it, is for educational purposes. I thought it would be very interesting to hear what people&rsquo;s favourite letters etc. is, and maybe make a costum font based on that information.</p>

<p>EDIT: And in a more helpful vein, there are actually several threads on Typophile that have been about favorite letters, favorite ampersands, favorite characters in a favorite font, etc. A Google search of Typophile for &ldquo;favorite letter&rdquo; and the like should turn up some good results.</p>

I would tend to agree, Mr. Lubalin having passed away in 1981. Besides that though, I&rsquo;m not sure what &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; is required spilling of, nor what &ldquo;fun&rdquo; there is in making/using Ransom Note fonts, as opposed to, for example — the study of, use of, and discourse upon whole alphabets, which is mostly what most of us do most of the time.</p>

Collage is a valid art form. Song remixes are too. Sampling, I guess. 
If the final form of a &lsquo;collage&rsquo; were whole or part of previous works not owned by the &lsquo;artist&rsquo; but given to the viewer to make a collage — is that &lsquo;giving&rsquo; a &lsquo;valid art form&rsquo;? ;-.</p>
<p>I like this work by the way, the letters in composition are well worth looking at. If one were to say, let&rsquo;s make squares out of our favorite letters and talk about &lsquo;em, I might think otherwise. But an &lsquo;homage&rsquo; ransom note font would not be so unless each person who viewed or used it knew, or could find from the work itself who made each letter, would it?</p>
