    and that is how InDesign refers to it. I would use the term \"raised cap\" for
    a large initial letter that is on the baseline (e.g. <cite>Harper's Magazine</cite>).\r\nWe
    also start talking about \"contoured drop cap\" to refer to a more fitted look
    that you might get on the right with some dropped characters (A, V, W).  There
    is also the dropcap that has the first line snug, but the rest knocked out as
    a block. Don't have a good name for that one.  <cite>National Geographic Magazine</cite>
    has many interesting examples of all of these."

  body: ">>>  (Is there a term for the third option, where the type hangs into the
    left margin \u2014 Hanging Initial?)\r\n\r\nYes. There is indeed a term for a
    drop cap or a stick-up initial that hangs into the left margin. \r\n\r\nThis is
    called GOOD TYPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not done as often as it should be. When
    that large cap is C G J O T V W or Y, you will want to hang it into the margin.
    How much depends on your overall design, and the types you are using, and your
    own eye. Even such seriffed caps as E and others with  strong vertical strokes
    may want to be hung out so the edge of the left side of the type block continues
    up with the vertical, and the serifs are hanging.\r\n\r\nAs for those \"contoured
    drop caps\", that also is not done as often as it should be. Too many large initial
    cap L or A are too far from the following sorts. Snug 'em up; make some nice-looking
    type.\r\n\r\nI do not know why these things are not done more. Laziness? Not knowing
    how to do it? Or, hell, maybe it just an aesthetic different than mine.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n"

  body: "Using the Type &gt; Story &gt; Optical Margin Alignment will do it, but only
    if you want optical margin alignment for the entire text. And even then, it doesn't
    really hang much (depending upon the character), but it'll pull back to zero in
    most cases.\r\n\r\nWhen optically adjusting the left alignment of a drop cap,
    I rely on a trick I developed way back in my early days working in Quark:\r\n\r\nInstead
    of setting the Drop Cap parameters on your paragraph to 1 char, set it to 2 char.
    Then insert a space as the first character of the paragraph. Now you've got something
    you can kern against. Place the cursor in-between the space and the first letter
    (your drop cap) and negative-kern away until it hangs out into the left margin
    just the way you want.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit of a kludgy, manual operation; but it
    allows you to get nice, optically aligned drop caps that travel within the text
    box with your paragraph and will continue to adjust with leading changes, etc.
    Better than a separate text box with runaround on it for the drop cap and manually
    sizing and aligning. I also found this trick easier to implement than an anchored
    box. \r\n\r\nMaybe someone knows a better way these days.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Kent:\r\n\r\nThat's great. I am curious about how you discovered that trick.
    I came across the same kludge maybe around 1990, and have relied on it ever since
    [I'm still a Quark guy]. I always set an en space in front of the drop.\r\n\r\nIt
    should be pointed out, though, that the part of the sort that falls outside the
    text box will not show on screen. It prints correctly, but it scares the bejabbers
    out of others who might look at your Quark file. At least that's always been my
    experience.\r\n\r\nI also use this to hang open quotes when I'm designing a jacket
    or cover and have to set the blurbs. This way you need not make any other calculations
    about your text box width and hanging indents, etc.\r\n\r\nI have gotten so used
    to doing this that it is second nature, and no longer seems awkward.\r\n\r\nA
    few years ago I showed this to my typography class, and I called it the \"$50
    type trick.\" One student, a career changer about my age, somehow managed to win
    50 bucks off his graphic designer son and a bunch of his designer pals, all of
    whom thought they were hot shots with the fancy type stuff. None of them could
    follow it.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you know this, and I'd be curious to know if others
    use this.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Will -- I suppose I adopted this technique about the same time as you. I
    think I started working in Quark around 1989 (Ready Set Go before that). I imagine
    I would have developed this trick within about a year or so.\r\n\r\nHow? I don't
    know; I had a problem to solve and I just worked out as elegant a solution as
    I could muster.\r\n\r\nBTW, in InDesign, text rasterizes completely even when
    it extends beyond the text frame. That makes this trick easier to manage in InD
    than Quark. I'm not sure why you set an en space. Shouldn't matter one way or
    another, except that an en is usually wider than most word spaces, so you just
    have to kern back further.\r\n\r\nChris -- For a while I was thinking you could
    go one step further and automate most of this trick with InD's nested styles.
    You could define one char style for the drop cap and define a secondary char style
    (\"drop space\") for the initial space, building in a large negative tracking
    value to accomplish the kerning (a work-around, since you can't define kerning
    values in a stylesheet). A single average value would allow you to get all straight-sided
    caps just right; others would need additional hand-tuning.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    it turns out that InD only lets you assign a single char style to the whole drop
    cap definition. Any nested styles read past the drop cap and pick up after. You
    can't get the nested style definitions to affect part of the drop cap. I guess
    drop cap definitions supercede the nested styles. \r\n\r\nOh well. It was a good
    idea and a valiant attempt.\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "Just after I made that post about the $50 type trick, I started working on
    a new book design, using Quark 7. I wanted to hang opening quotes in the first
    line in the book, so I dropped in the en space and kerned the quotes back to the
    left.\r\n\r\nLO & BEHOLD! I could see the quote marks floating there outside the
    text box! Finally.\r\n\r\nThis shows what happens when a book designer becomes
    a production manager. He or she has less opportunity to do the really pleasurable
    part of the job: book design. I now \"manage\" design more than I do it, and this
    may be the first time I had the opportunity to apply that trick in Quark 7.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the en space: It just seemed better to me to apply a fixed-width space than
    a justifying word space. It may have made no difference, but it is a habit I got
    into.\r\n\r\npowers"

    we use a 0-width space (U+200B). I admit I don't know if the zero width space
    is in InDesign as a default; I always add 2002 through 200B to a font. You have
    to go to the General Punctuation region anyway, to make up 2032 (prime/minute/foot),
    so why not add the extra spacing? The things the foundries forget . . .\r\n\r\nAs
    I remember, you can't easily kern more than 1,000 with InDesign, why give up whatever

  body: "In InDesign CS3 we added some functionality to improve the placement of dropcaps.
    In the dropcap & nested style panel there are 2 new checkboxes:\r\n<strong>Align
    Left Edge</strong> which adjusts the left edge of the dropcap based on the ink
    instead of the pen position. So, characters with positive or negative left side
    bearings are affected. There is a subjective element, I know, but our algorithm
    places the dropcap's left-most ink at the same position horizontally as that character's
    ink would be at the body text size. So the cap-J would hang outside the box slightly
    and the sans-serif H would be indented a tiny amount, but nothing like the original
    just-scaled version.\r\n<strong>Scale for Descenders</strong> if the dropcap extends
    below the baseline (cap-J sometimes, dropped words) then we can scale the dropcap
    smaller to place the bottom of the ink at the position the same text would be
    below the baseline in body size.  Some designers would prefer to drop more lines
    to keep the dropcap the same size, and some designers wanted the number of lines
    to remain constant -- we only implemented the latter.\r\nIn the Japanese version
    we added some additional controls to control the dropcap's relationship to an
    underlying character grid.\r\nHopefully, less manual work would be required."
