  could really use some help identifying this....well, ugly typeface. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typespecimen_4346.jpg]\r\nIt's
  the logotype of a client of mine (words scrambled to protect their identity). I'm
  doing a marginal \"refresh\" on the company's brand. However, not only are they
  refusing to let my company select a new typeface for them, they can't even tell
  us which typeface we can't change. Since they have no idea.\r\n\r\nI've been racking
  my brain and going through the usual online channels (identifont, etc.), but no
  luck. I was really hoping someone here might be able to help.\r\n\r\nFor clarification
  - the specimens you see before you are all the characters I have to work with. No
  lower case, no punctuation. \r\n\r\nThank you sincerely in advance for any clues."

    based on something recognizable.

  body: "hm. hard to guess. are all the letters from one word? (so, the inconsistency
    would be explained or denied if say one word was more fake bold than another?)\r\n\r\nhonestly
    with these samples i could guess it is two words, and that the font has been stretched.
    weird distortion in the bowls makes me think that. \r\n\r\nneed more clues!!"

  body: "The letters above are single instances of the entire company's name and sub-title.
    Many of the letters above are repeated multiple times (c, o, i, r).\r\n\r\nMy
    best guess at this point is that it's actually Arial Narrow Bold, scrunched down
    to roughly the natural x-height (to essentially make a \"wide\" version of the
    type), and then poorly retraced from a low-resolution jpg version of the logo,
    likely taken straight from the corporate web site. I'm not dealing with a client
    who has a history of valuing properly-handled or executed artwork. They have several
    different \"versions\" of the logo in active use, using completely different typefaces,
    and they don't seem to see any differences between them. The type samples above
    come from what they have declared to us was \"the official logo.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    crossbar of the H and the bottom bowl of the R and P were what tipped me off to
    it being a scrunched manipulation of a narrow case. The curvy leg of the R seems
    to be a custom element. Whether intentionally drawn that way, or just a clumsy
    evolution from multiple re-tracings I can't really say at this point.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you guys think? And thanks again for the responses. Much appreciated."
