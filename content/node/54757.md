  body: <a href="http://www.raster-noton.net/">Raster-Noton</a> always pays attention
    to typography - the latest Alva Noto CD uses some sort of custom typeface & the
    typographer's credited - don't have the CD with me, unfortunately. I think they're

  body: Now they are musicians. That would go well with an yellow and black label,
