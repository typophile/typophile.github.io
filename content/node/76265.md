  feedback from people with fresh eyes.\r\n\r\nHere's the logotype: http://drbl.in/COU
  (Also attached to this post)\r\n\r\nMy primary concern is legibility -- reads OK?\r\n\r\nAny
  other critique on form would be welcome. I'm not so sure about the colors (and don't
  think they matter at this point, can be changed).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nIdan"

    that it looks a lot like the Skil logo. Upon hunting for it, it's clearly different
    when side-by-side, but perhaps I'd push away from the red just to give it some
    distance. "
