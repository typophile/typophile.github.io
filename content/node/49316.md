  project. We came across the Netto font on this site and we were sold, literally,
  we bought the font and now, after some customization, it's being used for the logotype.\r\n\r\nThe
  question here is about finding a compliment. Can anyone suggest a \"corporate\"
  typeface to work with Netto?"

    Netto</a>.\r\n\r\nTell me more about the corporation. Who is your audience. What
    sort of tone do you want to convey. What reputation do you want to maintain? "

  body: If you're interested in keeping the same modern feeling of FF Netto in your
    supporting typography, consider <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=daxline%20pro">FF
    Daxline</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_din_pro_collection/">FF
    DIN</a> which are similar typefaces with additional weights, styles, and language
    support.

  body: "Thanks for the information. (This is a great site.)\r\n\r\nThe reputation
    should be that of a company that sits on a solid foundation of principles, yet
    is fluid and embraces change in a rapidly evolving technology. Their embrace of
    the Netto font in their logo redesign is a testament to their willingness to evolve
    into something more gender-neutral and organic."
