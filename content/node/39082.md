body: "There's a novel set in New York City -- a mystery story, I think, but one concerned
  with the printed word and mapping. In it, the hero/heroine traces out letterforms
  on the streets and avenues of the city with her path.\r\n\r\nI've never read the
  book, but I'd like to. Anyone remember the title? Got any impressions of it?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid"

    first part of his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Trilogy\">New
    York Trilogy</a>.\r\n\r\nF"
