    in Illy? I'll give it a shot later on.

    the word on fabric, distorted and photographed it, and then used that photo as
    reference to create vector art in Illustrator. '

  body: "So yeah, in Illy ...  Object>Envelope Distort>Make With Top Object to put
    the type in a frame in order to skew via anchor points. Object>Envelope Distort>Make
    With Mesh (I used a couple of different sizes from 5>20) to yank and pull the
    letter shapes. Then after you're finished playing around there go to Object>Envelope
    Distort>Expand to get all the Paths back. Add some anchor points where needed
    and fine tune. \r\n\r\nHere's my likeness  quicky (although not done as extreme)
    \ of your example bottom left (but I just couldn't bring myself to mangle the
    E like that and I used Impact font)...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/current.jpg\">\r\n\r\n...but
    of course as with most things in Ps and Illy there are several different ways
    to go about achieving the same results. It dawned on me half way through the I
    could simply set up a grid and manipulated the letter shape paths from there.
    Anyways I'm positive this can all be done in Illustrator. \r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    in the top left example is that the top and bottom bar could be manipulated separately.
    \r\n\r\nLuma, that's cool how was it done? Is it waving flag generator somewhere
    online?\r\n\r\nFlash extension?\r\n\r\nBlender?"

    stuff for sure. I gave Olins a call and they sent me over to GHAVA where I met
    a answering machine. I'll give a graphic design college prof friend a call and
    get to know this subject matter real well.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Porto Hub branding
    had done this image tracking typography a while ago...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/thisispacifica/5436284643/in/set-72157625900728803/\r\n\r\n<img

    like motion typography is my next journey of discovery :)"

  body: 'this is a rather simple process, it''s a plane with cloth properties and
    a texture that will probably be a eps file or high-res .jpg, then a wind "thingy"
    pointed to the plane to make the flag effect. '
