    name is. Is it:\r\n\r\nb emblematic\r\n\r\nbemblematic\r\n\r\nbe emblematic\r\n\r\nsomething
    else?\r\n\r\n\r\n?"

  body: "The best type treatment is the first one (but I would give rounded terminals
    to the inside of e (like b).\r\nAs Jonathan said, the logo looks confusingly near
    and similar to the type.\r\nEither you go with something like [e]mblematic or
    place the logo above the word."

  body: "Definitely not B and not C. Too busy. The A option is Ok, but the (b) again
    looks a bit forced and unbalanced. At the very least I would try and match the
    curvature of the brackets ends' to the b's bottom curve, and add a bit more padding
    on b's sides.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, have you considered something simpler, like
    so:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beemblematic_5811.png]\r\n<code></code>\r\nRound
    the square too perhaps.\r\n\r\n(edit) Oh, may be even just stack b on top of first
    e of emblematic? I think your choice of typeface gives the logo plenty of character
    already, just need a little something extra to make it stand out a bit more.\r\n\r\n(another
    edit) - why not try option C but drop the brackets? "

  body: Have you considered making the "a" more stencil-like? If you were to actually
    laser-cut the logo, that "a"'s interior space would fall onto the floor :)

  body: "Of the three I prefer the 1st one, although like Jonathan I'm not sure exactly
    how to read it. I think reversing it out, as apankrat suggested, has possibilities
    and may lead to a stronger graphic.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of your logo \u2014
    very wide relative to the height \u2014 may lead to legibility problems in situations
    where the logo needs to fit into a small space, as you'll end up with tiny type. "
