  body: "Well there were a lot of talk here on Typophile, on a lot of topics. It would
    be better to check if the issue you\u2019re interested in was already discussed.
    You can also resuscitate an old thread, adding what you think it\u2019s missing
    to it!\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/66005?page=3#comment-469592\r\n(sorry,

  body: I think the interrobang is an interesting concept. But then again, I feel
    like our current punctuation system(s) is/are perfectly sufficient for communication.
    I mean, it's obviously sufficient, because various people have pushed for the
    interrobang, and it's never been adopted by any major publication.

    way. Reading to the end of a sentence only to find out it was supposed to be\r\na
    question?! Come on. Having to change the typestyle to mark emphasis?! Sheesh.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
