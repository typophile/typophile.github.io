  body: That will do it but the type does have some differences from ITC Golden. The
    book was published in Germany in 1924 - text is in blackletter but the captions
    are different - any other suggestions of things close to Golden type but different
    - or maybe a German variant.

  body: Thank you Riccardo - Phinney jenson looks really good - the f has the right
    amount of condensed quality - the g is not quite angular enough but close.
