body: "This has been my summer/fall fun font\u2014an heavy, inline sans number font
  based on the numerals from a 1930s GE Strike clock. It\u2019s proved a challenge
  working on a font so heavy that has two different inline versions, but it\u2019s
  slowly coming together. \r\n\r\nHere are the different versions of the basic numerals.
  The screenshot is of the Illustrator file, so it doesn't represent spacing/kerning.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clock_6043.png]\r\nI
  think the 9, and therefore the 6, need some refinement, but other than that I'm
  pretty happy with the numerals.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and attatch a .pdf of the complete
  character set, but it's of the \u201Coutline\u201D version only.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll
  also put up some screen shots in a different post of some of the trickier characters
  I'm not sure are entirely working, but for now, would love to hear any thoughts
  and suggestions!"

    body: "Ok, sorry for the late reply (I was sidetracked with another idea I'll
      share), but yes. Because the numbers were optimized for a clock face, some of
      the proportions were very different. I have updated the |4| (which was too wide)
      and the |1| and I'm working on a new |2| as well. The originals I'm keeping
      as alternates.\r\nHere are the an updated |1| and |4|.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hola_3723.png]"

  body: "I began experimenting with glyph substitution with this typeface, just to
    learn how to do it, and the idea popped into my head that I could use it to create
    clock symbols using Discretionary Ligatures. I finally figured out the \"coding\"
    and created created some very simple clock symbols that show any time in five
    minute increments. (That's an extra 144 glyphs per font!)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/holo_6608.png]\r\n\r\nBecause
    this typeface is supposed to be layered, I built that into the clock symbols as
    well. The chart I created shows it best.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hole_5504.png]\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone think this is a useful or nifty feature? Or just a bother?\r\n\r\nAnd here
    are the missing characters from my pdf:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/holu_3653.png]"
