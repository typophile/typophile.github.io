body: "I should specify, I'm not a font creator, just an avid user. \r\n\r\nI'm currently
  running the Adobe CS2 Suite with Suitcase 9.2.2 on Windows XP. I have a question
  regarding the Font Menus in my Adobe applications. When I load a font into Suitcase
  and then open up Illustrator (for example), the font menu is pretty chaotic. Some
  fonts are grouped into a family, with a submenu of all the weights and styles, and
  then others are loaded directly into the menu per style or weight. This is very
  annoying because I can have a menu that is rather lengthy with just the addition
  of a few fonts.\r\n\r\nI read that Fontlab allows renaming/grouping. But, I don't
  have Fontlab, nor am interested in purchasing it (the expense isn't currently in
  my budget.) I am ASSUMING that some bright programmer out there might have created
  a single function program that regroups fonts for menus or re-family-izes them.
  Please keep in mind I'm using a PC and not a Mac (I know Apples are boss, but my
  boss doesn't think as highly of them.) \r\n"

    is not as simple as one might hope (and indeed continues to get more complicated).\r\n\r\nEven
    our own tool for *checking* font family relationships (CompareFamily in the AFDKO)
    isn't perfect - we can do a lot, but the tool can't psychically know what the
    user *intended to do* in naming the members of the family.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "It's frustrating for font developers as well.\r\nDo I name a typeface Bold
    Condensed or Condensed Bold?\r\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg.\r\nHow about
    BoldCondensed and Bold-Condensed as options? -- those are meaningful distinctions
    for software apps.\r\n\r\nAt least with the OpenType format we don't have to worry
    about SC&osf and expert fonts any more."

    like you're looking for something similar to the good old Adobe Type Reunion (ATR).\r\n\r\n>

    you're willing to edit the font files (and assuming that: 1. the license allows
    it, and 2. the fonts are TrueType and OpenType), the only thing you'll need is
    [[TTX]], which is free, and a lot of knowledge on how to juggle the various Name
    IDs of the <a href=\"http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_name.html\">'name'
    table</a>."
