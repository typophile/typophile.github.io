  used it in the past with great satisfaction, and it is my favourite font for offset.\r\n\r\nThe
  publisher decided to start printing on demand (POD) with Lightning Source, but Dante
  comes out very pale (see small sample).\r\n\r\nI was thinking of using Williams
  Caslon, as I have bought it recently for another job, but I am afraid it will still
  be too light.\r\n\r\nI looked at Dante Medium, but for some reason the charm of
  Dante Std is gone.\r\n\r\nWhat alternative would you advice?\r\n\r\nThis edition
  uses Lightning Source lightly cream 6x9 format. Type is currently set as 12/14.4.\r\n\r\nI
  was considering using Merlo, but I can't find it in OpenType. Since I am using XeLaTeX,
  OpenType would help my job considerably.\r\n\r\nThank you for any advice or tips
  you could spare,\r\n\r\nGuido\r\n"

  body: 'I guess I am a ludite in this respect. I loath Print On Demand, which I like
    to call Print No Demand, though in two moments of weakness I allowed a publisher
    to do two books of mine that way (via Lightning Source). Many fonts do not work
    well with POD. Aldus works. Sabon is ok. That was a few years ago. Of course there
    are others, and more by now, which work reasonably well. My favourite Centaur
    wouldn''t work. But I loath POD in principle. No edition. Poetry books and academic
    books spilling out at a tumbling rate, with no financial input, so to speak, from
    the publisher, largely ignored by book stores and reviewers. Lightning Source
    (and others) trying to leave their mark discreetly on the last page but with no
    feeling, no understanding . . . don''t let me go on . . . I won''t be able to
    stop. '

  body: "I agree 100%. I would call it \"soulless\". No soul, no heart, utter inability
    to convey beauty.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that kills the type is the subtle shiny
    gloss left from the toner. Even after weeks it does not go away, like cellophane
    wrap. \r\n\r\nSadly, I had no choice, the publisher is trying to survive, and
    POD is one of the ways they are trying.\r\n\r\nHaving looked carefully to the
    paper and the toner ink they use, I think I will settle with Merlo, 11.3/14.4.
    I could change it, but then I would have to adjust the grid, so much work.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for your notes."
