  But on one poster, I found a font that is very similar to typesetting. I'd like
  to know his name and origin. Thank you\r\n\r\nNote.\r\nThis piece of poster in 1973,
  from the book \u201CSandberg, vormgever van het Stedelijk\u201D, p. 172 (010 Publishers) "

    \u201Cmitarbeit\u201D looks different from the one in \u201Cfabriken\u201D."

    inscription there are a few \u201Csuspicious\u201D items. It may be distorted
    during the printing (silkscreen?) and subsequent photography. In general, it looks
    too \u201Cneat\u201D. For Sandberg, in particular."

    \"Bodoni Stencil\" lettering.\r\nI found a complete lower case set in this book:

    ever used my font for this project:[[http://www.pavillonblanc-colomiers.fr/page/restitution-2012-2013]]\r\nEvgeny'spost
    gave me some help for the numbers.\r\nAnd now, I'm working on the upper case.\r\nPerhaps
    somebodies found other Sandberg creations with this kind of handmade bodoni stencil
    in number or upper case ?\r\nThanks."
