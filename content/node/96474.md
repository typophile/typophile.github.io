body: A friend is getting a tattoo of the phrase in the attached photo.  I was thinking
  of making her something when she's done.  She doesn't remember the name of the font.  I
  think it may be called Grandma's Hand, but I am not certain.  I appreciate any help.  Thank
  you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo2_4426.jpg]
