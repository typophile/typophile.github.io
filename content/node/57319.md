  body: "I actually spent a fair amount of time looking for this at MyFonts and Dafont
    with no luck. I am having trouble deciding what category or keyword would best
    describe it. To me this looks like the work of a professional type designer, but
    it is not familiar enough, except as a general 'fun' style, to know where to look.
    I am looking again, but I hope someone answers this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "If you are willing to consider fonts with a similar feeling, I have written
    down a few I've seen at MyFonts so far: Good Eatin, Houndcats, Framistat and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/eborg-itc/|ITC
    Eborg]].\r\n\r\nI made a link for the last one, because I am an Eborg fan, and
    use it a lot myself.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
