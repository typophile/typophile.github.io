  body: I think you should exaggerate the grid more. As it is it only looks a little
    more like a mistake and less like you intended for them to be mis-aligned. If
    you exaggerate the shapes it will add more depth and look more purposeful.

  body: Thanks Tiffany! Amazing how you instantly see stuff as soon as someone else
    mentions it! I&#39;m all goggle eyed today from doing this, so I shall have a
    go at modifying them tomorrow.... <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>James <BR>

  body: 'Nice start! <BR> <BR>Two things to note: <BR>1. Pay attention to the thickness
    in the horizontals vs verticals. The horizontals start looking too thick... see
    your Friday, May 21, 2004 - 3:40 pm post. The black makes it look more pronounced.
    Thin those up a bit &#40;or thicken the verticals&#41;. Slanting makes the problem
    worse so you&#39;ll need to over-correct for it. Work in black &#40;not outline&#41;.
    It won&#39;t hide the problems. <BR> <BR>2. Know when to break your grid. Not
    all caps are meant to fit in the same width. That N for example is looking cramped.
    A is a little cramped. L a hair wide. C is wide. E maybe a hair wide. <BR> <BR>Not
    super excited about the style of wings. They look kind of like a hair comb! Nice
    guitar BTW. <BR> <BR>Keep at it! <BR>Randy'
