body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nok, you'll have excuse the language I might use, no it's not
  rude, but I am relatively new to type design. I've been asked by my company, a national
  newspaper in Ireland to create Polish versions of the typefaces we use. At the moment
  our typefaces have no Polish characters. I can draw the required characters no problem
  in Fontlab, I found an excellent article online on how to do this but when it comes
  to generating the actual font I'm running into difficulties.\r\n\r\nOur publishing
  system ONLY allows Windows postscript fonts which have a character limit of 255.
  My new glyphs are not showing up in the generated font. So my question is, how do
  can I achieve this? Many thanks.\r\n\r\nregards, Chris"

  body: What does "Windows postscript font" mean, in this context? Are you limited
    to one particular codepage for Windows? (For example, ISO 8859-1.)

  body: "If you need to create a Windows PostScript font, you can just use a different
    codepage for the font. This will give you the slots that you need for Polish (and
    a number of other Eastern European languages). You can switch between different
    codepages or different encoding files in FontLab.\r\n\r\nWhat is the typeface
    that your newspaper uses? You might be able to license a Central European version
    of the font in Windows PostScript. (At Linotype, for instance, we still have thousands
    of fonts in this format, but only for fonts made before about 2004)."

  body: "Chris, I see that the Irish Times uses the Flama and Expresso typefaces.
    These are both from M\xE1rio Feliciano in Portugal (http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com).
    It would be best just to contact him directly. He probably has versions of the
    fonts that meet your language and software requirements that you can use, saving
    you the trouble of having to create them yourself. Or, he could whip them up in
    a jiffy."

  body: dan_reynolds, Thanks for that. Good guess! We want to try and keep this an
    in-house project at the moment. Your first comment has helped me though, will
    test later on. I also have to do Czech as well and I have to this for both families!
    Thanks for your help! Just curious, how did you 'see' the Irish Times uses Expresso
    and Flama?

  body: "Fortunately, the CE codepages and encoding files in FontLab should contain
    all the Polish and Czech diacritics, so you won't have to make separate font files
    for each of those two languages.\r\n\r\nAs for the font identification, I wish
    I could say that I had been sitting in a pub in Dublin, and that I reached over
    and glanced at the newspaper, recognizing the fonts instantly! Instead, I got
    a PDF and looked at that.\r\n\r\nAt newseum.com, there is a daily collection of
    PDFs of front pages of newspapers from around the world. I looked at today's European
    papers, and was glad to see the Irish Times there. I downloaded the PDF, opened
    it up in Acrobat, and looked at the embedded fonts in the document's preferences.
    Then I went over to M\xE1rio's website to find the fonts, and make sure that nothing
    had gone wrong with the PDF.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/"

    than a pint of Guinness and the newspaper. \r\n\r\nOur publishing system almost
    makes Gutenbergs moveable type archaic! I'm pretty new to FontLab so I'm still
    learning, the 900+ page PDF manual is not the easiest read!"

    Feliciano unless he expressly permits it. It's called 'droit morale' or moral
    rights, and they protect all creative expressions from misrepresentation (the
    author's right to integrity). Droit morale covers the EU of which both Ireland
    and Portugal are members. Further I can see that Mario has already designed the
    relevant glyphs for Polish."

  body: "That is a good point, of course. On M\xE1rio's website, Expresso isn't available
    for general licensing. So I assume that the Irish Times must have some special
    license from him. I'm sure that this license carefully delineates whether or not
    the Times can make modifications themselves, and what sort of modifications are
    allowed (if any are allowed)."

  body: "Chris, \r\n\r\n1. In FontLab Studio's Font Window, switch to Names mode,
    and from the encoding dropdown list, choose \"Type 1 World Microsoft\" / \"MS
    Windows 1250 Central European\". \r\n2. In Font Info / Encoding and Unicode /
    Microsoft Character Set, you may need to choose \"Central (Eastern) European\".
    Generate the font as Type 1 -- that would be the standards-compliant way (the
    font will have a custom encoding, marked as \"CE). \r\n3. If your system does
    not recognize non-Western Type 1 fonts (which is possible), choose \"Bitstream
    font set\" in Font Info / Encoding and Unicode / Microsoft Character Set instead
    (this way, the font will have a custom encoding but marked as \"Western\"). \r\n\r\n(Damn,
    I already started thinking about removing the non-Unicode font generation options,
    but it seems they're still being used by some folks. :) ). "
