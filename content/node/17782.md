body: "I have a question about saving logos for use by \"non-design types\" in my
  office. I create alot of program oriented logos that later are used in paper proposals
  and power point presentations. I've never been quite sure I'm saving my logos in
  the best possible way to retain the quality no matter what size they end up using
  it at.  \r\n\r\nIn practice I save 2 versions (outside of the AI and EPS versions
  I use.) \r\nUnder the Save for Web feature I save a JPEG version (usually very large
  like 8\" X 10\") and a GIF (also very large, but with Transparency turned on to
  eliminate the white box)\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's a better way, that I can save it
  to retain the vector quality of size doesn't matter along with the transparent border
  and then allowing it to be \"non-designer\" friendly for programs such as Microsoft
  Word or Power point. \r\n\r\nI'd be very interested in hearing your thoughts on
  how wrong/right this process is."

  body: "If it matters, we use Office 2003. I find the Microsoft suite extremely difficult
    to use, it's not a quick learn for me. As far as the logos I create, they're usually
    4 color process. We don't have the software to create fonts available, but I have
    seen the technique used and it does seem very user-friendly. \r\n\r\nI'm sure
    the way I create my logos for use aren't wrong, but I'm also sure there's a way
    to do it where I save time by creating one user-friendly file that's universally
    accepted by all programs.\r\n\r\nWhat is that unversally accepted standard to
    create that file? "

  body: Illustrator CS has the capacity to export WMF files. I'm not sure what other
    versions of Illy are able to do this. Whenever my mom wants custom artwork, I
    draw it out in Illy, export a WMF, place it in a file for her (a Word Document
    ususally) and then send her that file to use as a template. She should be able
    to cut/paste into other Office documents, &c.

  body: Asvetic, I see a few choices based on specifics in the design. If you have
    one color, consider saving as a high res (600ppi) bitmap TIFF. As a bitmap (black
    and white) and not grayscale, the file will print razor sharp and, since its only
    2 bit, will be very small file size wise (use lzw compression). Any user could
    specify a spot color for the image if needed. If you have more colors or gradients,
    consider PNG-24. It's lossless, supports high resolution, has an 8 bit alpha channel,
    and most applications these days are loving it. Even PowerPoint and Word.  Be
    careful using a "Save for Web" option to create it though- tyically the res gets
    changed to 72-96ppi- which, if placed in Word" would look huge.

    body: Yes. The benefit to PNG-24 (over PNG-8) is that it not only supports the
      complete transparency of eliminated backgrounds, but also supports the semi
      transparency of antialiased edges and drop shadows.

  body: "I do9 a lot of this kind of work and think you are probably already going
    the best way about it. We have a vast library of logos, and in each case save
    down large RGB GIFs with transparent backgrounds and JPEGs for MS Office alongside
    the CMYK EPS for Quark use. Making your GIFs very large minimises the appearance
    of the rough edge caused by GIF's on/off transparency.\r\n\r\nNote though that
    print dimensions in inches are irrelevant in both JPG and GIF. \r\n\r\nYou could
    use quite a few other formats on the MSO side but they all have pitfalls.\r\n\r\nAs
    Nick says, WMF, which is the internal PC metaformat, can hold vector data but
    I find it unreliable at preserving anything more than simple line art, gradients
    and dashed lines for example can cause problems. This is the format usually used
    for vector clip art however.\r\n\r\nYou can import and print EPS files into MSO
    apps, but I don't think you can see a preview of their content on screen, at least
    not on PC?\r\n\r\n24 bit PNG has proper transparency support, but not in MSO apps.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Even more foolproof is to keep your logo library in Powerpoint so users can
    just copy and paste; a lot of people don't know how to insert an image into a
    document let alone resize it without stretching it...

    a good idea about the Power Point logo library, but I can see that file getting
    deleted real easy.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments, I love this forum! I know this
    is a type oriented community, but there's enough design brains that when topics
    that are less type driven come up, there's always an answer. It's like the most
    powerful organized design braintrust around! \r\n"
