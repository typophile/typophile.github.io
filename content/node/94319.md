body: "I need a 2 to fit in with a design I am doing.  It's going to be the main part
  of the design and I think I want a Didone for it.  It will be a sort of secondary
  logo and will be used in different settings so it needs to be a character in itself
  , I want it to have a lot of character, to be swaggering and strong. I also want
  to use a typeface that would have been available in the second half of the 1800s,
  say 1850 to 1905.\r\n\r\nThe strongest contender I have found so far Is Poster Bodoni
  but the \"foot\" on the 2 looks a little unstable to me. The Basilia has a stronger
  looking foot but seems to have no life in it.  I also think Basilia is a modern
  font, but am not sure. I'd really like to be as authentic as possible with this
  and use something from the period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I'd be really grateful if
  people could recommend their favourite Didone with a good strong glyph for its 2.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/didone-2s_4859.jpg]"

  body: "Of the two options you show, the Bodoni is probably more historically accurate,
    although this particular treatment is a little more recent than the timeframe
    you're shooting at. Even then, high contrast Didones probably enjoyed their greatest
    popularity during the first half of the nineteenth century, starting around 1825
    or 1828.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you're looking for a numeral two that says
    \u201CI\u2019m well-grounded, but I still know how to have a good time,\u201D
    you might want to check this one out...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/spiffily-nf/regular/glyphs.html\r\n\r\nIn
    my humble opinion, it has kind of a \u201CI am going boldly where no man had gone
    before\u201D vibe to it, which pretty much fits in with the British colonialist
    expansion spirit from your target time period."
