  but I have recently taken an interest in typography and would like to start learning
  about it. I mean anything -- history, important fonts, popular fonts, who''s who
  in fontdom, etc. Basically, I am looking for any books in particular that deal with
  these subjects. That''s a little vague. Sorry. Take this for example, though: you
  know how there are books about the basic manufacturing process of, say, single-malt
  scotch? Or books that give you tips about tasting it, or the rituals of tasting,
  or that list the tools you need to really savor it? I mean those kinds of books,
  except for typography. And if there are no books like that, maybe a website will
  do. Anything you can offer really. Thanks in advance. I really appreciate it.'

  body: Hey, thanks! I was sort of hoping for more than one source, though. No one
    knows, like, a textbook or something? :(

    a list of well regarded titles. You will also see a link to \u201CThe Triumvirate

    Style by Robert Bringhurst\r\nAnatomy of a Typeface by Alexander Lawson\r\nLetters

  body: "If you start off with lawson, you might lose enthusiasm quickly. it's a great
    book, but... \r\n\r\nif you are lucky enough to read french, grab a copy of \"histoire
    de l'ecriture typographique\" by yves perrousseaux. extremely good, volume one
    in a series of 4 (will be completed around 2012), 450 pages, the only precise,
    big format, full of color high res illustrations encyclopedia of type. there is
    no equivalent in english language so far, and we are trying hard to find a publisher
    in the US or in the UK. if you know one...\r\n\r\nalso, \"type\" by simon loxley.
    funny and informative, even though poorly printed.\r\n\r\nand also, my book (guide
    pratique de choix typographique), also no equivalent in english. also trying to
    get a publisher.\r\n\r\ndr"
