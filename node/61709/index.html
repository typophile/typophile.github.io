believe it or not, david, in spite of all those clues you left,
i didn't know that was sarcasm until i hit the winky smilie,
because lots of people actually _believe_ that line o' crap.

print will never die.  not until most of the trees die first.
(and humans won't have long to live after that happens.)

but bookstores, especially the big chains?  well, borders
probably has 2-5 years left, and barnes & noble 5-10...
spare us your whimpering.  didn't help record-stores any.

What line of crap? Adobe, Apple and MS all claim to "render the screen as close as possible to the printed page". 
One over does it, one does it right, and one under does it. Until they care more about the screen, people will need to print from the screen to read it, or buy books. Reading will die before printing, because french fries need to be boxed.

"in the universe"?  that's a pretty clear signal you're talking crap.
hyperbole and sarcasm are great friends; they vacation together.

and "nearly all" is yet another clear signal.  judging by the numbers
for internet-exploder-6-and-7, many of our computer screens now
(even in the first world) are hooked up to aging p.c. machines which
might not even have (working) printers attached to them any more...
and inkjet printers (and dot-matrix?) aren't exactly known for quality,
especially when their users are stretching the cartridges to save cash.


>   are enabled only or primarily to preview print on computer screens, 
>   print will never die! ;)

again, the word "only" here is an _obvious_ tipoff that this is sarcasm,
and "primarily" right behind it just means that it's not purely sarcastic.

the notion that any significant number of people print out their e-mail
to read it was buried -- along with those oldsters -- in the last century.

and i've never heard -- not even once, not even in jest, mind you -- that
people print out their twitterstream to read it.  (but it'd be a good joke!)

nor do we hear about blog posts being printed, or facebook pages,
or myspace pages, or wikipedia articles, or live-journal pages, or...

and if you're gonna print out stuff from a news-site, you might as well
have bought the newspaper, and we all know how newspapers are doing.

so the only way your sentence makes any sense is to turn it on its head:
the only reason people still use print is to proofread stuff for the screen.

and given the apparent absence of proofreading out there in the world,
i'd say there isn't even much of _that_ type of printing going on...

cory said it years ago, and it only becomes more true as time passes by:
more and more we are reading less from paper, and more from the screen.


>   people will need to print from the screen to read it, or buy books

well, there you go!  bookstores!  tomorrow's growth industry!  for sure!

well, that might be the relationship
between print and _your_ screen,
but i don't think it's typical for all,
or even the majority of people now.

and i explained why, clearly, i hope.

but yes, you're quite right, david --
i've lived quite happily without even
having a printer for many years now.

however, i was just trying to discern
if you were being sarcastic, or not...

if you were serious, it's fine with me.
i might not agree with your assertion,
but live your life however you like, ok?

Oh.

Oh, thanks. I'll change my mind based on your kittly litter induced acid trip.

		<div class="commentbody">Going back to the original thread, Cushing Academy's decision to discard or give away the library books and replace them with e-readers and a cappuccino machine: Why did it have to be either/or? If I were paying [[http://www.cushing.org/admission/tuition.shtml|in the mid-30s]] to send my kid to high school, I'd expect e-readers, cappuccino, and books too. 

I would ask the same question to publishers and readers: <em>Why does it have to be either/or?</em> Hard-copy books are still a choice; they're often a good choice. They're just not the <em>only</em> choice anymore.</div>
