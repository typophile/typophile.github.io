  <BR>So I took some pictures, most of them too lousy to show, <BR>but most of the
  rest can be found here, avec captions: <BR><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419"
  target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419</a>@N00/sets/279430/ <BR>&#40;Copy-paste
  that whole thing.&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, Nadine, apparently the Virgin rooftop closes
  for the winter, <BR>but it <i>was</i> open when we were there - although in the
  end my <BR>program for one was too full to make it there this time. <BR> <BR>hhp'
