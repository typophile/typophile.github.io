body: "When I was fresh out of school I wanted to do a grandiose thesis to prove myself
  and ended up working for 8 years without my diploma. Now I just want to do a simple
  thesis project to be able to teach a couple of classes.\r\n\r\nI am aiming to propose
  a new type taxonomy system for latin alphabet typefaces and I would like your valuable
  opinion to help me decide if this is reasonable and achievable.\r\n\r\nI know typophiles
  are not fond of type classifications because they tend to misrepresent the universe
  of the typographic inventory. My aim is no to try to create a new definitive or
  better system but to explore a different perspective.\r\n\r\nThe criteria for this
  new taxonomy would be the graphic construction system behind the typeface rather
  than the historical or stylistic approach. Some advantages of this taxonomic criteria
  would be more and better categories to classify all non serif typefaces and the
  creation of a wider vocabulary to study or discuss different constructive approaches
  in type design.\r\n\r\nA system like this would require much more categories than
  the traditional ones and as a consequence a wide vocabulary to describe different
  graphic construction systems. \r\n\r\nI  am aware of <a href=\"http://www.stbride.org/friends/conference/twentiethcenturygraphiccommunication/TypefaceClassification.html\"
  target=\"blank\">Catherine Dixon\u2019s </a>work and I think this classification
  criteria would fit into the construction or modelling formal attributes of her <a

  target=\"blank\">Description Framework</a>\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of it? Is this
  nonsense? Is this too complicated for three months of work?\r\n"

  body: "It depends on what you ask of it.  The whole picture seems too broad for
    3 months work. I would approach from a user stand point and ask yourself what
    this taxonomy would do to be of help to the user?  I get easily bored of endless
    discussions on what pigeon hole to put things in. If all you do is put things
    in to categories, what value comes out of it.  If you have 100 random people and
    put them in an order by shoe size, it is easy to measure.  After you are done
    with this accurate system, what do you do with it?. \r\nType is far more complex
    than shoe size but after you put everything in a category, what do you do with
    it?  Does it matter?\r\nThe current taxonomy is very roughly based on history
    and what came before what.  Several years back, this was much easier.  Today,
    where every old face has 10 revivals and knock-offs, it is much tougher.  Again,
    if you do it, what will it do for you for the trouble. If when you finish, all
    you get is a bunch of argument about the result, what have you gained?"

  body: "People interested in type taxonomy should know that I am hosting a panel
    on design taxonomy at the College Art Association Conference in New York City
    next February. Here's the call for papers (proposals due next Friday!):\r\n\r\nPUTTING
    DESIGN IN BOXES:\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF TAXONOMY\r\n\r\nWhen design historians label
    a chair as \u201CLouis XV\u201D style or a typeface as a \u201Chumanist sans-serif,\u201D
    they are imposing classification schemes upon these design artifacts. This taxonomic
    approach, which has shaped much of design history, itself deserves attention.
    This panel welcomes papers that address the problem of taxonomy in the historiography
    of design, whether through case studies or theoretical reflections. Papers might
    consider the entrenchment of classification systems in the practice of design
    studies (e.g., in textbooks and syllabi); might address the roles of industry
    in both demanding and supplying classification schemes; or might probe the points
    at which taxonomic systems fail. Looking ahead, papers might also propose new
    strategies for effective classification (perhaps employing bottom-up semantic
    tagging in place of top-down fixed categorical schemes). The panel will consider
    how the intentional examination of the problem of taxonomy can generate insights
    both about design and about the scholarship thereof.\r\n\r\nProposals due May
    4, 2012 \r\nSession chair: Craig Eliason, University of St. Thomas (MN)\r\nParticipants
    must be members of the College Art Association at the time of the conference.\r\nMore

  body: "Each approach has its pros and cons. But we still don't have a good ahistoric/form-based
    one, so I hope you go for it - you can certainly make some progress in three months
    (although maybe not enough to pass some kind of formal academic evaluation).\r\n\r\nI
    think the key to avoiding an overwhelming complexity is somehow layering or grouping
    the various form-based concepts for people to navigate through, as deeply as they
    feel like.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Eliason, it sounds very interesting but I don't think I can have anything
    on the deadline. This is just a draft idea.\r\n\r\nThis taxonomy would not be
    very useful for the end user of typefaces but rather to the people studiyng or
    designing type. The value of categorization is that it enables systematic analysis
    and eases discussion.\r\n\r\nBy graphic construction systems I try to point out
    the different graphic techniques or styles that can be used to create letterforms.
    Each technique has an inner logic that will manifest in the final letter shape.
    The central problem would be to create a vocabulary to describe very abstract
    categories such as different stroke modulation styles in sans serifs. Other categories
    would be easy do describe when they follow primitive graphic principles.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    it was too soon to post the idea, I'm having troubles to come up with appropriate
    categories for fonts like Neo Sans or Cholla Sans."
