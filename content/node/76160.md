  body: 'They tend to be just like regular interviews without the process of show
    and tell. Find a nice quiet place and give yourself a second to settle down before.
    They''re going to want to know if you are capable of doing the job (at least the
    talking part) but mostly they want to know what your personality is. Are you super
    formal and serious, are you funny and witty, annoying and crazy, etc. Good interviews
    don''t usually include weird questions, if something weird happens take it as
    a sign you actually might not want to work there anyway.  '

  body: Sometimes your mind can go temporarily blank when you're nervous, so have
    some notes in front of you -- your resume, the name of the interviewer and the
    name of his/her company, and any other info that might come up.

    to flip through your online portfolio if they\u2019ll be looking at it during
    the interview. Be careful not to make any humorous remarks as they may not be
    interpreted correctly without facial expressions backing them up."

  body: "What Nick said is very important: employers value honest and don\u2019t want
    you bullshitting them. They would rather hire someone who will ask for help or
    look it up than someone who will try to fake it and botch a job."

  body: "> employers value honest \r\n\r\nI once heard a personnel manager say that
    skills can be taught but a person's character is almost impossible to change,
    so he always looked for people who were honest and hard working even if they needed
    some additional training in job skills."
