body: "Trying to generate a self-created True Type font.\r\n\r\nWhen validating and/or
  generating the True Type Font I'm getting a bunch of characters with \"There is
  another glyph in the font with this unicode code point\" error messages. \r\nThis
  happens after hinting, removing overlaps, correcting directions... It's the only
  thing that comes up when validating the font, everything else seems to be fine.\r\n\r\nIs
  this a real issue I should be concerned about and if so how do I solve it?\r\nThe
  FF Validation messages don't have any details to them other than the name of the
  character with the respective issue as quoted above. By clicking on that list item
  it opens the respective problem character (for example LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E) but
  I don't see any reference as to where the (other) duplicate character sits and I
  don't understand what exactly I'm supposed to do. \r\nAm I supposed to just erase
  that character and hope I killed the right one of the two? Sorry in case I don't
  see/understand the obvious...\r\n\r\nI tried to detach the respective characters.
  Tried to restart XQuartz and FontForge. But problems/messages persist.\r\n\r\nI
  created the font from scratch. I use my own all Western European Character set (incl.
  all accents and some ligatures).\r\n\r\nXQuartz 2.7.11 (xorg-server 1.18.4) FontForge

  help is appreciated! Thank you!"
