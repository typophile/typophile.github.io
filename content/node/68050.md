  a sampling of what I have to work with:\r\nhttp://www.marionkay.com/home.htm\r\n\r\nI
  drew up this fairly quickly from a sketch I had done.\r\nI'm eager to have better
  eyes tell me what needs to change.\r\nAs I'm posting this I am already seeing a
  couple weight issues.\r\nI'm not sure about that K...\r\n\r\nLet me know where you
  see I need to change things.\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nLuke\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MKLOGO_4020.gif]"

    either. When I think of spices I think earth tones and vibrant reds... maybe yellow
    but that's a very small maybe. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree about the colors.\r\n\r\nRegarding the lettering: \"r\"/\"i\" doesn't
    read well for me, but that might very well be culture specific. Also, and this
    might be a stupid question, what's that crossbar on top of the \"M\"? Looks like
    it's trying to be a \"T\" or a pi. Pie spices? :-)\r\n\r\nAlso, that tittle (i-dot)
    really is a bit too Doritos. (<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MsH3sU6kX9w/R0_o3RXcooI/AAAAAAAABTg/glIISJosr_8/s1600-R/Sour%2BCream%2BDoritos.jpg\">Link
