  Archaelologist Consultancy based in Arizona and San Francisco. \r\n\r\nIm wondering
  if anyones got any typeface suggestions in terms of perhaps a sort of historic sort
  of initial arrangement for the company's acronym \"WSA\" pairied with a modern and
  corporate lineale. \r\n\r\nIm also considering a series of marks for different aspects
  of the company and to be used primarily on the web.\r\n\r\nIf anyone actually give
  two expletives you can see the web site at http://www.williamself.com\r\n\r\nThe
  main design issue is that they are not really willing to spend the money to completely
  rebrand all at once. Their logo was cheaply built and works, but is generally disliked
  by the staff. However the new logo must sort of honor whats existed for the past
  15 or so years. So to keep jabbering, its gotta find a way to phase in or look the
  same as what they currently have only it will contain a much more organized hierarchy
  and graphic standard. \r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for your time\r\n"
