body: "Hello All, \r\nIts my first time posting here after watching for a long time.
  In my Graphic Design class we created a non-profit organization based on a cause
  we were interested in and created a name for it. I'm concerned about school nutrition
  and eco-literacy so my non-profit is one that helps develop school gardens for learning
  and to provide the schools with fresh foods. The gardens would be run by the students
  of the schools.\r\n\r\n I have created three different logos. I want to exude a
  playful look without being childish because the company has to get across its mission
  to the school officials and parents not just the students.\r\n\r\n Two are more
  of symbol like logos and I am still working on them and finding the proper type
  to go with them. Please let me know your suggestions and otherwise. For the typographic
  marks I used Plak by Paul Renner, Clarendon, Glypha, and Gill Sans. "

    the S formed in the logo and creating a typeface (or just the letters needed)
    based around it for the word Sprout? It would create a stronger relationship between
    the logo and type.\r\n"

  body: 'That is a interesting idea. I haven''t tried that yet. I guess you are referring
    to the fourth image. My only hesitation is that the letters would be of a light
    weight b/c the S created in negative space is thin but I will attempt to execute
    your suggestion. Thank you!  '

  body: Certainly, picture 8 is the strongest of the logos presented. However, I don't
    think the S in the leaves is a good candidate for becoming a typeface. I think
    the heaviness of the Clarendon anchors the logo. (You could try other slab serifs,
    but I think a slab serif is a good choice.)

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PictureType_4610.gif]\r\n\r\nThis is
    my quick attempt to execute what <br> WhereIputStuff </br> suggested. I don't
    feel its working too well and is crude- my grasp on Illustrator is weaker than
    my grasp of a pencil. The letters are too stylized for my purposes. Perhaps I
    should draw more, scan, and then try again...or not.  \r\n\r\nSpeter- Thank you
    for your comment. I agree with your observation about the S within the leaves.
    I like the feel of slab-serifs with it and will continue to try this approach.
    I have a few on my computer and I think I got some when I purchased my school's
    font set. What are your feelings/observations about the first image in my post?

    is lost. (Yes, I do see the two halves of a pea/bean, but it doesn't quite work.)\r\n\r\nTake
    the idea of Picture 8 and polish it up a bit. It's got the \"hidden message\"
    of, say, the FedEx logo. *That's* powerful. Go with it."

    my sketches (type as leaf, leaf coming out of/off type) and found it too whimsical
    and cookie-cutter for my company. I will try it out though after re drawing the
    r form and the leaf form so that it looks cohesive.  '

  body: "I guess my approach to this logotype would differ in its choice of imagery.
    \r\nWhat I have seen so far are not so much sprouts but leaves. The image that
    comes to my mind here is one or a row of seedlings, just poking their fresh green
    heads through a mound of soil. \r\nI am unsure whether spelling out text with
    an image is a bad solution here, considering it has been done - and badly so -
    so many, many times. \r\nThe alternative to this would be augmenting the image
    with some type. I scanned a page of sketches I made just now. \r\nHopefully I
    can free up some time tomorrow to elaborate and these a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SproutSketch_3555.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks, it looks like you put a lot of time into those nice sketches, but
    that direction is cheesy and way too literal for me. I also think I saw it done
    before when I was doing research on similar organizations.\r\n\r\nAlso, it might
    just be the way I've seen crits done in school and on this site, but you didn't
    address my original posts at all. While I appreciate your approach, not giving
    me anything to build on what I've already done is throwing the baby out with the
    bathwater. "
