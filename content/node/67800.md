    exactly in Guardian Text. I'm using it for legal texts (where there are lots of
    numbers due to law references) and it works very well.\r\n\r\nAnother font very
    good for text largely mixed with numbers is Utopia."

    is big on numbers, with ten sets of figures in each font, and all current currency
    symbols. All the fonts--roman and italic, regular and bold, serif and sans--have
    tab figures with identical width (except the extra bold sans).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you believe I did not know Scotch/Figgins until I read this thread? I got impressed.
    Modern Suite is a great font package, very complete and with fine numbers. Nick
    pays attention to details and have a deep historical knowledge.\r\n\r\nI don't
    think it's old'ish \u2013 almost all fashion magazines adopt modern typefaces,
    for example. And Figgins has real italics, adding flexibility to text composition.
    But of course it may not work in the design you're planning.\r\n.\r\n\r\n<cite>Utopia
    is nice, pitty there is no sans.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt works very well with Myriad/Frutiger.
    For me, the major problem in Utopia is the lacking of small caps in italics.\r\n\r\nCeleste
    is another superfamily you may find good for this job.\r\n\r\nThe serif family
    I'm developing (http://www.typophile.com/node/67787) also aims to be suitable
    for texts with many numbers. But it's just an essay by now."
