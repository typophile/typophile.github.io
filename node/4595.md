  <BR> <BR>Venceremos is my first crack at a wedge-serif &#40;latin&#41; font. It
  more or less follows the models set by Stephenson Blake

    page tabloid activist quarterly, David?  <BR>Another nice one. Perhaps the leg

    the  <BR>funky stress angle and its affect on the caps. <BR> <BR>Stephen '

    ALT=":&#41;"> I served as the first art director of &#34;Venceremos,&#34; which
    is indeed still being published as a quarterly tabloid directed at the &#34;Latina/o
    &amp; Chicana/o&#34; community here in Salt Lake City. <BR> <BR>I was told by
    its editors that &#34;Venceremos&#34; is a spanish phrase that translates roughly
    as, &#34;We shall overcome.&#34; It struck me as a great name for a font, although
    the publication has yet to utilize it. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>That looks like good advice
    on the uc &#34;R&#34;, too. I&#39;ll play with it &amp; post the developments.

    like the UC is a little light compared to the lc, or vice versa. <BR> <BR>Any
    chance of a text setting? '

  body: ' David one more time congratulations to the work. <BR>I like very must the
    expression of each part of each caracter which is  very expressive.  <BR>In Portuguese
    language the name &#34;venceremos&#34; it means &#34;we will win&#34; funny. I
    don&acute;t have critics to say I agree with your options and is a very good work.
    Best regards David. <BR>Ricardo '
