    be quite important to Cuba, since they have it on their flag, too.\r\n\r\nOr is
    Si just upset because of the Comic Sans reference?"

    - just couldn't watch the game last night without thinking of the Comic Sans euro.
    I'd agree that the World Baseball Classic uniforms were pretty bad (unimaginative),
    but the Cuban outfits were better than most."

  body: "World Baseball Classic is a commercial venture by Major League Baseball and
    has nothing really to do with International competition.\r\n\r\nThe uniforms and
    equipment were probably bid on by companies and designed by Bud Selig. It was
    all for show since Mike Piazza probably doesn't have an Italian passport. Just
    like the drug testing, that poor Korean pitcher only got to play in the first
    game before being made an example of. \r\n\r\nThe Italian team! \r\nPhil Barzilla
