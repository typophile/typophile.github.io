  body: "Thanks Tiffany, nice sleuthing; it was driving me nuts that I couldn't find
    any more info on the web about it. Do you know if Commercial Type did all the
    Puma jersey's? [[http://www.worldcupblog.org/world-cup-2010/jerseys-world-cup-2010/world-cup-2010-jerseys-cameroon.html|Camaroon's
    away jersey is pretty great as well.]]\r\n\r\nPosts like these remind me that
    there actually is a reason to use twitter."
