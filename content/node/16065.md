  Wiebking was born in Germany in 1870, the oldest son of an engraver. In 1881 the
  family came to Chicago where his father made engraving machines and cut type matrices
  for the Marder & Luse type foundry.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert was 14, he went to work for
  C. H. Hanson, an engraving company. By 1893 he had set up his own engraving business
  and was cutting matrices for both the Crescent and Independent Type Foundries. In
  1900 he formed the Advance Type Foundry with H. H. Hardinge. Together the two men
  designed various pieces of machinery including precision tools for matrice fitting,
  an air driven automatic tool to break the casting sprues or jets off type bodies,
  and an automatic casting and finishing machine for type. The improvements allowed
  Wiebking to cut the matrices for the 14 point size of [[Frederick Goudy]]\u2019s
  [[Kennerley]] type, then cast and finish 400 lbs. of the type in 41 hours.\r\n\r\nHardinge
  left the partnership in 1914 when Wiebking merged Advance with the Western Type
  Foundry. Five years later the Western Foundry merged into Barnhart Brothers & Spindler
  Foundry. Several years later, Wiebking set up a small shop where he cut matrices
  for F. W. Goudy, the original [[Centaur]] matrices for [[Bruce Rogers]], as well
  as matrices for the [[Barnhart Brothers and Spindler|Barnhart Brothers & Spindler]],
  the [[American Type Founders|American]], [[Inland Type Foundry|Inland]] and [[Keystone
  Type Foundry|Keystone]] Type Foundries, and for John Haddon and Co. and [[Stephenson
  Blake]] in England. Later he cut matrices for [[Ludlow Typograph]] and built several
  matrice cutters for them as well as trained their staff to use them. Among the people
  he trained to cut matrices were Frederick W. Goudy and [[Robert Hunter Middleton]].\r\n\r\nTypefaces
