		<div class="commentbody">Not exactly the response I was hoping for. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wolfe starts off comparing it to the Vienna Secession, how they both had their own singular building, which was the center for the &quot;compound&quot; out of which all the rules and ideas came from. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->His main critique is that it became so important and so highly regarded that an attempt at anything else was considered &quot;bourgeois&quot;, and almost even spiritually wrong. (The book makes many religious references.) Another main point is how clients didn't ever actually like the designs they were paying for, but kept paying for them anyways, allowing the designers/architects to dictate to them what was good and bad.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It deals mostly with architecture, rather than type or any other art, but certainly the applications can be made. It talks about how even Philip Johnson used to like to be called &quot;Mies van der Johnson&quot; and that even the architects who realized the flaw of everything looking &quot;bauhaus&quot; had to become part of the system in order to be taken seriously and still move away from it (Robert Venturi.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It has a really striking picure that I hadn't seen before of one section of Yale (a museum I think) which was done in gothic revival, next to an addition in bauhaus style, and it looks rather pathethic, even though it is &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;clean&quot; which is still how people like to describe &quot;good&quot; design, and think that if they say, &quot;this is good because it is simple&quot; that they are automatically justified. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here's a random thought; I really hope the new WTC design isn't just another &quot;glass box&quot; but is instead something really creative. If we keep rebuilding mimics of the past we aren't really making much progress. (Maybe this relates to redoing old typefaces?) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyhow, good book.

		<div class="commentbody">The biggest problem with 'Bauhaus' typography (and note that the biggest proponent of asymetric typography, Tschichold, was not involved with the Bauhaus) is that it is very hard to do well. Tschichold could do it well, and could also do classical typography well, and his realisation was that in the latter it was easier for the average craftsman to achieve an attractive result. Only a handful of people produced really good modernist typography: more of it was sterile. I suspect that the same is true of architecture, although in that field one should take into account materials and building techniques as well as aesthetics when one talks about what constitutes modern.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rodolfo, thanks for the book suggestion! I need something to determine how much weight to put on Wolfe's comments. His arguments seem correct, but he himself seems to poke fun at his own off-centered viewpoints. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GG, one of your links had a picture of the book in it. (don't know if you've read the book.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not saying I don't like Kahn or the Bauhaus overall. In fact, Paul Klee has been my favorite artist for quite some time, and I like what Peter Behrens for example did with sans, but mainly just because of when he did it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After looking through several sites, it seems to me that Kahn's work does highly resemble the Bauhaus, even though he had a lot of spoken ideas that were different. This is another point the book was making&hellip;tons of ideas were going around, but everything still looked the same. Kahn talks about how going back to the beginning is where all the excitement is. If this isn't Bauhaus&hellip; I mean, that's straight from the mouth of Gropius. (O white god!)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> kahn info<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (click the blue links on this page) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> more kahn info<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (I apologize in advance for the massive amount of red you are about to see.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like many of Kahn's aspirations, particularly regarding artificial &amp; natural light. But about other things I'm not sure: &quot;Beauty was not within his immediate concerns.&quot; This is especially confusing when, for example, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it talks about Kahn saying how beautiful columns are, but his addition doesn't have any columns, does it? (maybe it does on the inside?) It's just a wall, with lines, that supposedly reveals the structure of the original. His connections between columns and bringing in light and dividing spaces is pretty brilliant though, and I see how the inside brings in light. But still confused on the outside. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems that Kahn's addition could have better related to its context. The context is an entire campus built in gothic revival. How does the International style fit in here? I'm not saying that it can't.. at this point I'm still asking questions, because it's not immediately obvious. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If he would have said that the building was about contrast, I might at least see where he was coming from. But he says his building &quot;revealed the structure&quot; of the gothic one next door&hellip; I need to see how. Is putting something plain (possibly boring) next to something exciting revealing the structure of anything? The book does mention that the interior made use of some clever innovations. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[pic of the lighting]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> That's really nice! Except, still, I don't see how it relates to gothic architecture. Another museum he did used long vaults (long hallways were an international style thing) and I see how that relates, but that was in texas, and later on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One more link: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kahn summary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A quote from Kahn on this page&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;A museum seems like a secondary thing, unless it is a great treasury. A treasury, a guarded love for your source. Oh, what a place that would be! Not just an accumulation crowded together. You go through halls and halls and halls. The Museum of Cairo is a confined building that looks more like a storage house than it does a museum.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->which is this: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

My experience is that their actual buildings, though, are emotionally cold and inhospitable.

To me the Bauhaus is a period of bad taste and bad buildings, and kind of inverse Victorianism, which I also dislike.     <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I haven't studied the history, either in architecture or typography, but of course we are surrounded by the stuff in one way or another.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your theory of his reasons for returning to classical typography conflict with mine however. Do you have source on that. I am very interested in him and his works. Also, as you know, Tschichold and I had a mutual friend.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In what I've read of Tschichold's own writing, he never rejects asymetric typography; rather, he rejects his early ideological insistence on asymetric typography, and acknowledges that both asymetric and classical typography have their place, with the latter being most appropriate for books. I think it is important to look at the kind of material Tschichold was designing at different points in his career, and that the move to classical typography coincides with a move from advertising and what we would now call 'identity' design (e.g. stationery) to book design &ndash; and book design of a specific kind: predominantly literary texts in octavo format. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have an interesting German book that combines Tschichold's writings &ndash; illustrated with samples of his work &ndash; from both halves of his career. Most English language publications, excepting Ruari Maclean's not very good biography, deal with either his asymetric typography <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> his classical book design, as determined by the interest/bias of the translator or publisher. The German book is better, I think, because it conveys the consistency of Tschichold's attention to detail and quality, and makes one realise how this, not apparently opposing styles, is really key to understanding what Tschichold was about. In his early career, he developed asymetric typography to a very high level, and wrote books urging other typographers to follow suit. In his later career, he applied exactly the same level of quality to classical typography, and wrote what amount to style guides that would enable other typographers to achieve pleasing results. This is why I think the relative ease of achieving such results in the classical style, compared the more difficult task of achieving beauty in asymetric typography, was an important factor in Tschichold's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->volte face<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, especially as it is expressed in pedagogical efforts such as the essays in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The form of the book.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The fact that he developed his classical book design techniques in the context of the Penguin publishing programme is also interesting, and suggests a context in which mass-production of attractive typography, achievable by designers and printers following style guides, would become preferable to more difficult works requiring individual genius of the kind Tschichold himself had demonstrated in his early career.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Brian <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I too very much like Bauhaus-inspired architecture, but I also loved Tom Wolfe's book. It's a really fascinating and well-developed argument.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another book you may like is Prince Charles'  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of Architecture.&quot; Here's a couple of lines I got off Amazon's website about it: &quot;The Prince's central point is that modern architecture has lost sight of its surroundings. Rather than creating structures that harmonize with their location, using local materials and respecting the history of the site, many modern buildings seem determined to draw attention to themselves &ndash; or rather, to their architects. Like any art, architecture is a matter of taste. But while you can hide a bad statue or painting, an ugly building is a blot on the landscape that's darn hard to avoid.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I read this book way back when it was published &ndash; I think in the mid 1980s. It caused quite a stir at the time, but now his argument seems pretty sensible. The book also includes some fairly decent drawings by the prince himself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Troy <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
