body: I am considering putting together a script that converts all the letter/letter
  pairs in a Metrics Machine pair list into a word list by pulling words from dictionaries.
  Before I go through the trouble is there already one out there?

  body: "If you have a list of the pairs you can loop through them and for each, do:\r\n\r\n<code>grep
    '[kern pair]' /usr/share/dict/words</code>\r\n\r\nor you can do clever things
    like two at once, eg\r\n\r\n<code>cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep '[kern pair
    1]' | grep '[kern pair 2]'</code>\r\n\r\nso \r\n\r\n<code>cat /usr/share/dict/words
    | grep 'av' | grep 'aw'</code>\r\n\r\nwill get you\r\n\r\n<code>awave\r\ndrawshave</code>\r\n\r\nto
    output words in all caps add this\r\n\r\n<code>| tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'</code>\r\n\r\nto
    output words with initial caps add this\r\n\r\n<code>| sed 's:^\\(.\\):\\\\U\\\\1:g'</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The above ideas should work on most or all Unix/Linux-based systems, including
    System X.\r\n\r\nBut if all you have is a Windows box, you can get some wordlists
    from [[http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/]] and the utility kit from [[http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/]]
    and then get down and dirty with the command line. I think they'll work with MSWindows
    95-XP. Beyond that, no idea at all.\r\n"

  body: I was thinking more along the lines of using python to dump a collection of
    word lists into one big and then iterate through a list of pairs and formatting
    the new split words. I'll cobble something together tomorrow.
