  to the Nutritional information on the side of food packaging, this is the new label
  that is featured on the front or top of the package. I'm included an image so if
  anyone can help me, I'd be eternally grateful. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nag-img_3964.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you so much for responding, but that was one of the very first fonts
    I tried (along with Frutiger and a couple of others)\r\n\r\nUnivers is very close,
    but the lower case g's (and some other characters) are completely different. "
