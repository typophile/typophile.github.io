body: "I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but every time I get to designing
  an /x/ or /X/, I wonder \"am I doing this correctly?\". After 3-4 year of doing
  type design work, I still can't seem to figure out the correct approach to optically
  correcting an /X/! It is also frustrating because on just about every other glyph,
  I can see the problem areas, but for the /X/ I can't ever seem to tell what I need
  to do...\r\n\r\nIt seems a bit easier on a sans, but i've referenced some serif
  and slab serifs and cannot seem to figure out how the designer got to the final
  thing (alignment of the points on the central joint, all the serifs are a bit different
  size...).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any tips on how they approach the /X/, or maybe
  links to previous posts about this (I had a lot of trouble searching for a single
  letter on the forum).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    the thinner stroke at the center of the intersection.\r\n3. Lower the inner end
    of the upper piece and raise the inner end of the lower piece equally and incrementally
    until the optical illusion is gone and the thinner stoke looks like it shoots
    straight through.\r\n4. At some point remove overlaps.\r\n\r\nOf course, there
    are other ways to do it (you could create four nodes on the thin stroke within
    the intersection to make a parallelogram, and then skew those, for example). "
