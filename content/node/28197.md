  body: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Hamnett\r\n\r\nArial seems highly
    unlikely for the original tshirt since Arial was designed in 1982 and only widely
    released in 1990 while Relax and Wake Me up were released in 1984, the image of
    the tshirt is said to be a knock off so it might be.\r\n\r\n"

    just something about the possible curved leg to the R that's bugging me."

    relax</em> I seem to remember that it was originally in a condensed or compressed
    face like compacta.\r\nTim"
