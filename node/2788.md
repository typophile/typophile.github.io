  come cheap, and I am curious to see how you all feel about such an endeavour.

  body: how do you get fellow list members aware what a thread is about once you&#39;ve
    posted the title? I wonder why nobody says anything :-S. <BR> <BR>george

  body: 'Hey George, <BR> <BR>Some of the forum members receive e-mail updates on
    some of the threads. I guess your question was not very clear, that is why you
    got no feedback. <BR> <BR>... so what is your question? <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s about
    logotype tuning, I have a favorite: Miles Newlyn&#39;s 2002 Honda tuning. And
    while Matthew Carter&#39;s MoMA is not an exciting update, I still think he&#39;s
    a great type designer &#40;I love his work for Walker Art Center - <a href="http://www.walkerart.org"

  body: For the MoMA thing &#40;which has actually been discussed here and on Typographica
    in the past&#41; it&#39;s very important to remember that Carter redesigned the
    <i>body face</i> and not the logo per se. Huge difference. And if the MoMA people
    like using a text font for their logo that&#39;s their problem. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Do you think that finetuning can sometimes be read as ... the designer sees
    that there is too much cache invested in the current logo and doesn&#39;t want
    to be accused of &#40;A&#41; ruining a good thing &#40;B&#41; not being able to
    help ... therefore &#40;C&#41; they only finetune?

  body: In the case of the MoMA logo, this is simply replacing one typeface by another.
    Often finetuning of a logo becomes necessary because the original has been physically
    degraded, e.g. during transfer of the image from one technology to another, or
    because people implementing the identity have not strictly followed guidelines
    or used original source versions. This is particularly true for large organisations
    that have multiple offices in different cities or countries working with local
    design agencies to produce material that uses the logo.

  body: Good point John. I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Indeed, the original copy of
    any given logo can become corrupted in one way or another.
