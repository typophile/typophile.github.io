  not looking for typefaces with Welsh character support, although I'm assuming that
  they probably will have it, rather typefaces created in Wales or by Welsh people.\r\n\r\nThank

    by John Hudson and Geraldine Wade was named as such because:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
    name Sylfaen, which provides the pun in my title, is a Welsh word meaning foundation.
    Since Geraldine and I were both raised in Wales, it seemed appropriate to pick
    a Welsh name for our joint typeface: to insist on the continued importance of
    the heritage of a particular place, even as we set out to make a font for many
    places.</blockquote>"
