  body: Yes, I saw results already. I was thinking more - what happened with the competition
    after 2009? Is it dead?

  body: "\u2018Dead\u2019 is probably the wrong word here\u2026 It is my understanding
    that <em><a href=\"http://one-d.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=63&Itemid=63\">Sovremennaya
    Kyrillitsa</a></em> (\u2018Modern Cyrillic\u2019), dedicated to the <a href=\"http://tdc.org/news/2005atypiciviltype.html\">tercentenary
    of Russian Civil Type</a>, was a one-off event. I was on the jury, and I don\u2019t
    remember hearing of any plans to turn it into a recurring affair (once every few
    years or so).\r\n\r\nThere was a similar competition held in Moscow ten years
    earlier, <em><a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/Ulc/2541/Kyrillitsa.htm\">Kyrillitsa
    \u201999</a></em>. In their putting together <em>Modern Cyrillic</em> its organisers
    seemed to be encouraged and inspired by the success of that contest"
