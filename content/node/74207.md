body: "Hi everyone. I'm making my first font and it has a ton of ligatures. I have
  six versions of some ligatures. Now I'm beginning the proces of getting them to
  work with code, though I've never written code I'm learning it as I go, with this
  font. \r\n\r\nMy question is about the difference between stylistic alternates en
  stylistic sets. What is the difference exactly??  \r\nThe manual says this about
  stylistic alternates... or contextual alternates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Alternate Substitution\r\nAlternate
  substitution replaces a glyph with one of the glyphs in a predefined\r\nlist of
  alternatives. The application that uses the font is expected to\r\ndecide which
  glyph to choose. A good example of this lookup is to provide\r\nseveral versions
  of some glyph, like the ampersand. Another application is\r\nthe selection of several
  different forms of ornaments.</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that with stylistic
  alternates the program you use chooses a random glyph from the glyphs you created?
  \r\n\r\nI want the user to be able to choose an alternate glyph... \r\n"

    for that -- leave it to the user to pick any single character. (Ed. Well, the
    software doesn't choose, it selects the default glyph; but it allows the <em>user</em>
    to replace it with any other one.)\r\n\r\nStylistic sets can be created to automatically
    select one consistent glyph design for a number of alternate characters. For example,
    if you have a few different paragraph (pilcrow) designs, and different section
    signs to match the style of each pilcrow, you can create a stylistic set for each
    combination, so the user doesn't have to pick-and-match combinations by himself."

  body: "by that you mean.. bounding box?? The little icon bottom right of the glyph
    panel? \r\nNot working, symbols should be as big as any other font shouldnt they?
    Could it possibly be because there is one glyph that is bigger then 2 glyph windows?\r\n\r\nedit:
    Yes it was!!"
