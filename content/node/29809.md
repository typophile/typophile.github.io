body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface for the business card of an architect.
  It should be fresh & original but \"professional\" in the same time - I mean the
  feeling everything she designs meets the standards. It might have some \"square\"
  elements as her personal logo is square too.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mt_bc_1_4522.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mt_bc_2_5292.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be very appreciated.\r\n\r\n__\r\nAL"

    it, you could go with something like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=heldustry&image.x=0&image.y=0\"
    target=\"_blank\">Heldustry</a>, the love-child of Helvetica and Eurostile.\r\n\r\n
