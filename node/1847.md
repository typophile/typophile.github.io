body: Hi, <BR>Im working from an ibook which has OS 9 &amp; 10 using InDesign which
  opens on system 10. I need to use wingdings 3 and have it placed in the system 9
  fonts folder, here it works in other programs that open in 10 like photoshop, illustrator
  etc. And though i have the option of selecting wingdings in InDesign the font is
  just those error squares, and as strange as it may sound when i take wingdings 3
  out of the fonts folder in works in InDesign but not the others. <BR> <BR>Has anyone
  any idea what the reason is for this? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>David.

    <BR> <BR>... which might help. <BR> <BR>The challenge w/ OS X is that there are
    so many different places you can put fonts:  <BR> <BR>Mac OS 9/System Folder/Fonts
    <BR>System/Library/Fonts <BR>Network/Library/Fonts <BR>Library/Fonts <BR>/Users/your
    user name/Library/Fonts <BR>Application'
