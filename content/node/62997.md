  body: "Understood about Windows XP anti-aliasing (which is why I was asking you
    about it the other day), but it also looks like this was an OpenType CFF font,
    so the OS version differences and default settings are even less relevant. The
    article about this has a lot of errors. My lengthy thoughts are here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/10/boing-boing-web-fonts/\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "thanks for the correct link. \r\n\r\nThe original article is dead on. All
    fonts work straight away for text on all Mac OSX unless the user has turned off
    quartz rendering at an unusually high size. If they have, <em>the user themselves</em>
    can change the setting and the fonts will look better. All fonts look like ass
    on all Windows unless expensive and time-consuming work is performed on them,
    or the user has much more resolution than normal. Since the web is resolution
    independent, the work must be done... or ass. After this expensive and time-consuming
    work is done, some Windows type still looks like ass, but it's clean ass and people
    will get used to it, because they are Windows users.  \r\n\r\nThe only difference
    between us and Boing-Boing, is that we do not count on antialiasing alone to solve
    this problem, but we are a very very small minority of developers.\r\n\r\n>my
    guess is that they used a TrueType font without a correctly set \u201Cgasp\u201D
    table.\r\n\r\nHave you, yourself... actually tested this with all versions of
    IE? :-o.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

    you read the article? It wasn't talking about IE...\r\n\r\n\"The problem is that
    while modern browsers, like the latest versions of Safari, Firefox, Opera and
    Google Chrome, all support @font-face, the Windows XP operating system often doesn\u2019t
    have anti-aliasing turned on by default\""

    in spirit though, in general, Font vs Ass is Mac vs Windows. \r\nAnd part of the

  body: "For sure. I've been looking at font rendering in IE since version 1.0, and
    every version I tested (with installed and EOT fonts) respected gasp settings
    if the OS was set to grayscale, up to the point when IE started forcing on ClearType
    (IE7). If the browsers use GDI and the system is set to grayscale, I see no reason
    why pre IE7 versions of IE would do anything differently than a regular GDI app.
    \r\n\r\n>Are not the settings of this table up to the application to use, not
    the OS?\r\n\r\nTypically no. The apps use the system setting. Hence IE7+ forcing
    on CT everywhere, not just within the browser. "

    many apps do their own rendering and ignore these settings, for example InDesign,
    Silverlight 2, Flash, Acrobat viewer, etc., \r\n\r\nMy guess is that Windows based
    browsers rely on GDI for the text rendering for performance reasons. As noted
    <A HREF=\"http://typophile.com/node/46760\">elsewhere</A> performance trumps good
    typography for the webkit folks and the others too probably. \r\n\r\n>The settings
    of the GASP table, which are size specific recommendations for when to use what
    hints and rendering, are these up to the application or the OS to obey?\r\n\r\nTypically
    GDI apps do not override the system settings or a fonts gasp table if it has one.
    Although I think it's possible for them to do so. I can't say I've seen an application
    that does. \r\n\r\nBringing this back to browsers, if they stick with GDI they
    could probably have some control over the way @font-face fonts are rendered -
    maybe picking regular antialiasing instead of ClearType.\r\n"
