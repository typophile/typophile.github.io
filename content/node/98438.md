body: "We've designed and built a  TTF Windows symbol font which seems to work perfectly
  in all Windows applications except CharMap.  In the Charmap preview the glyphs in
  a section of the font are right-aligned in the cell rather than centred.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI've
  tried replacing the gylphs, copied and pasted ones which are centred both whole
  character and the glyphs but these then are right-aligned in the new position but
  not in their original position. I've checked the same font under Windows v7 and
  XP - still the same but the preview in our own character map \r\n\r\nThe error occurs
  between unicode F080 and F09F (the section after the euro sign). Any ideas what's
  going wrong? Obviously we're software developers not font designers but per se,
  but I've put a lot of effort into getting this font right.\r\n\r\nThanks in anticipation
  of your help.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nHere (hopefully) is the preview of what we're seeing:"
