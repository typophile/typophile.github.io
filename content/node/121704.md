  a Live performing business bringing a new type of Immersive audio visual live shows.\r\n\r\nI'm
  searching for a futuristic font with square lines  to transmit the following messages:
  Futuristic, forward thinking, cutting edge, fresh, next generation.\r\n\r\nDoing
  a quick search; I came up with the following fonts (see attached image)\r\n\r\nA-
  Anita semi square\r\nB- Capella extra condensed\r\nC- Nextwave condensed\r\nD- Nano
  Low\r\nE- Radio space\r\nF- 5th Agent\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich one do you think could suit
  best ?\r\n\r\nHave you got an advice for a better font ?"

    am a graphic designer, though, and based on my experience, nobody--not even cutting-edge,
    next-generation people--likes to read whole sentences or paragraphs in all caps,
    so I'd advise against B, C, and D. \r\n\r\nE and F are fine for a logo, but too
    hard to read for a whole sentence or paragraph. But maybe that's the effect you're
    aiming for: something that looks like a secret code that only the cool kids can
    read, and their parents (me) can't read."

    read sentences/paragraphs set that way.

  body: ">  emails, text\r\n\r\nWon't work. Emails and texts use fonts the recipients
    have on their computers/tablets/phones. If you use an unusual font which those
    folks don't have, it will appear in a different font on their devices.\r\n\r\nAn
    alternative for email might be to send the message as a graphic or PDF to preserve
    the fonts and appearance. Keep in mind that some folks (mostly on cell phones
    or tablets using data plans) don't download graphics automatically so they won't
    go over their bandwidth allotment, which may reduce readership. \r\n\r\nAnother
    option is to include a link to a web page."
