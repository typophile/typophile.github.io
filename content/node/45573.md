    you give any more background on the company? The mark <cite>looks</cite> quite

    certain type of clientele so their work needs to back up the unique look of the
    logo. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see a few examples of what they've done to see
    if the logo would match. \r\n\r\nAlso I would thicken the weight of the type.
    I don't think it'll lose anything in doing so. \r\n\r\nI dig the colors and the

  body: "Thanks for all the feedback.\r\n\r\nThey do interiors, and the logo is a
    bit to modern and cutting edge for most of their work, but they are at a point
    where they start getting more young designers working for them, and if the designers
    can\xB4t be in front who is supposed to be? I just have to mention that the other
    direction for this logo is a straight Aksidenz Grotesk Black or, only typo(nothing
    to show you at this point). \r\n\r\nThey do mostly restaurants and caf\xE9s. You
    can have a look at their old [[http://www.rissdesign.no|website]], which I\xB4m
    going to redesign, and that\xB4s the reason for changing the logo. They are not
    quite satisfied with their old logo and the website is not updated since 2004
    or something, have a look for yourselves. \r\n\r\nThe form is meant to be new
    and unconventional. Clean cut and out of the box at the same time. \r\n\r\nI can
    see that the thin lines in negative may cause problems on some surfaces and should
    be tested, but newspaper print will never be an issue I guess. It will always
    be printed in 100%, so no room for raggedy lines caused by raster points.  \r\n\r\n@Ratbaggy:
    Sorry, but I don\xB4t quite see the messy part, and if you look at modern architecture
    you will see lots of structures that are a lot more unconventional and still are
    great structures. Check out these norwegians for instance: http://www.snoarc.no/#/main/

  body: "The conflict for me is when I think modern/contemporary architecture, I think
    clean lines and plenty of right angles. So there's some dissonance with this particular
    shape in the logo...especially on your second mock-up of their web site...everythign
    is in right angles except the logo. What if you gave it at least one right angle,
    and maybe reduced the number of sides? Make it a box, with one angle pulled out
    into space like you have it?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the shape in the lower
    left, either. Seems a bit arbitrary and maybe unecessary. \r\n\r\nThe type and
    colors are great."

    - it does seem to be somewhat of an afterthought with no real purpose. \r\n\r\nHowever,
    I really agree with the direction you're trying to take. Judging by the old website
    and the photos on there, their interiors in their portfolio are modern enough.
    They don't appear massively cutting edge or ultra modern, but look like good examples
    of commercial interior design. If, like you say, there are more and more young
    designers joining then your logo may help to nudge the business in the right direction.\r\n"

  body: "IMO the irregular shape says <em>contemporary</em> architecture pretty well.
    Reminds me of the recent addition to the [[http://www.view.captureweb.co.uk/images/trueimages/H&/DM/-W/AC/-0/02/9-/H&DM-WAC-0029-A-2.jpg|Walker
    Arts Center]] in Minneapolis. We're a ways now from International Style boxes
    equalling architecture. I do get \"clean cut and out of the box at the same time\"
    from this.\r\n\r\nI also would say I do see a purpose in the lower left shape
    - I see it as an abstract screen or something set up within the room created by
    the larger shape. It both makes the big shape easier to read as an architectural
    plan, and calls attention to the interior look as the focus. I'm not saying it
    shouldn't be altered, but I wouldn't omit it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: is the shape in the lower left to emphasize something about the company? is
    there another meaning behind it? I'm not as bothered by it. Without it I think
    the entire shape will look even more awkward. IMO if you make it a box with just
    one angled corner you're going to have something generic and less interesting.

  body: "[critic_mode]\r\n\r\nI agree with hola's comment about the odd angle in the
    lower left. It's a bit of clutter that should be amputated (although maybe I'm
    just an International Style purist in hiding).\r\n\r\nAs for the larger shape...
    I think I'm ok with an abstract shape, but it has to be a sexy shape. It has to
    have rhythm, proportion, scale, and all those other things that make an object
    look like more than just an object. You know... FORM. The current shape isn't
    cutting it.\r\n\r\nThe brutal angularity of the shape also sets up a conflict
    with the light and airy typeface you've chosen. Whether you want that conflict
    or not is up to you. But considering that this is interior architecture, I would
    suspect that you want to smooth out conflict as much as possible. People typically
    don't want conflict in their interior spaces, whether the exterior of the structure
    looks like a Daniel Libeskind product or not.\r\n\r\nWhy not just use RISS with
    the small (interior) angle, and get rid of the bigger angle shape? If the logo
    is about communicating an idea about space, it might help to break out of the
    box (whether the box is an abstract hexagon or a rectangle) and \"unbound\" the
    logo in a field of whitespace. It will make things seem more open and less boxed
    in. Think about a room with a nice corner and open windows on the other sides,
    versus a wonky six-walled room that you could never fit your furniture in.\r\n\r\nBut
    then, yeah, it looks like you haven't done much work. At the end of the day, it
    takes a lot of work to make things simple. You could always show the client this
    current angular/boxed-in logo and say, \"look how I took my original concept and
    cleaned it up.\" They're architects, they'll love it.\r\n\r\nFYI: whether they're
    architects or not, I highly suspect that they'd appreciate being called \"clients\"
    instead of \"customers.\"\r\n\r\n[/critic_mode]"

  body: "well, let's think of some of nature's most spectacular 'architectural' structures
    for inspiration:\r\n\r\n- seedlings growing into trees\r\n\r\n- flowers blooming\r\n\r\n-
    beehives\r\n\r\n- mountains\r\n\r\n\r\nor what about high orders of design in
    nature:\r\n\r\n- sunflower seeds\r\n\r\n- leaves\r\n\r\nnot saying you should
    depict these, but maybe looking at them will inspire another idea.  It's something
    I find amazing and awe inspiring to look up at a mountain and touch it, see how
    sheer the height is.  To know how small I am and even how small that mountain
    is in the cosmos and yet it's still towering over me, immovable.\r\n\r\nI think
    for an architect, to achieve that same emotion or even to indicate that awe somehow
    visually through a logo would be the strongest and best message an architect could
    give.  Design and stability. symmetry. vast porportions. classical.\r\n\r\nI mean,
    something funky and 'hip' might be trendy, but I don't see security in it, or
    longevity as a logo.  I would look at greek architecture and see how they built
    everything beautifully and symmetrically.  They used neat little tricks like the
    golden section and there's somewhat of a love/hate relationship between designers
    and the golden section, but nobody claims it's downright ugly and horrible.\r\n\r\nEmploying
    simple tools like symmettry, classical type and the golden section, I think you
    could come up with a great logo that's sturdy, elegant and at-one-with-nature
    that would give it a transparent trust as soon as you saw it."
