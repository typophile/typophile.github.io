  such is life. \r\n\r\nThe related copy....\r\n\r\nMore than a century ago, Frank
  H. Atkinson presented this hand lettered style as Broken Poster. It was one of a
  hundred styles he demonstrated in his manual on sign painting. Even before his book
  was published (and certainly after), Broken Poster was a favorite with sign painters
  and letterers. It has graced show cards and movie posters, signs and windows displays,
  and advertisements of all varieties. We presented the our first digital revival
  of this classic in 2000. It is long overdue for an upgrade.\r\n\r\nBroken Gothic
  expands the basic Broken Poster to four weights, two specialty formats and some
  cool layed effects. The language base includes Greek, Cyrillic, Latin A, and some
  of Latin B and Latin Extended. There are also some nice alternates and ligatures.
  All weights are quite suited to posters, headlines, display copy, web headers, etc.\r\n\r\nAt
  first glance, Broken Gothic may seem to have limited uses. Give it a chance and
  it will surprise you. Broken shouts out that there is a sale, a giant monster or
  the end of the world. Broken Gothic is comfortable in a wide range of themes and
  applications from zombie movie titles to salsa jar labels. While I can't recommend
  it for text, Broken is great for headers, banners, signs, titles, product presentation
  and other display applications. When you need a rough customer, Broken Gothic fills
  the bill.\r\n\r\nOkay, so copywriting was never my strong suit. You try coming up
  this stuff with wife, dog and teenage son interrupting at regular intervals. \r\n\r\nThe
  Posters...\r\nI like this poster and I don't care what anyone says...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vintage

  body: "I still have some more ideas for sample posters for Broken Gothic. I thought
    the font would look really cool on a vintage burlap potato sack. I've seen it
    used on posters and signs. Atkinson demonstrated the poster weight. A painter
    would simply have used a narrower brush. The lighter weights I added expand Broken
    Gothic's usefulness to graphics in the digital age. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vintage
