  from www.shutterstock.com to design a T-Shirt, and I wonder if anyone knows wich
  font is the attached font (I try to insert the image, but I couldn't)\r\n\r\nI know
  for sure that the \u201Cvintage\u201D effect was custom made, so I\u2019m looking
  for the original typeface...\r\n\r\nThanks!! I\u2019ll be around...\r\n\r\nQ\u2122

  body: "This thing has attributes of more than one blackletter style, which to me
    suggests a custom font, or hand-lettering. The 'a' and 'd' are like Frakturs,
    but other letters are like Gotisch faces. See <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/wittenberger-fraktur/mt-bold/\">Wittenberger
    Fraktur</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/weiss-rundgotisch/ef-regular/\">Weiss-Rundgotisch</a>
