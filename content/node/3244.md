    company, which I will be starting with a friend at some point when we can both
    be proactive enough, will be pitching our sockets based flash compatible chat
    software to customer relations companies. Getchatting.com was by coincedence already
    registered by the man who subsequently offered to lend us a bit of money &#40;getchatting
    being related slightly to his company getmapping&#41;. So the tone &#40;though
    not the fonts or graphics&#41; may be roughly similar to getmapping. '

    retro, offbeat, vintage, different. <BR> <BR>become logo: I think this would be
    helped by tighter spacing. Also, you have a lot of talents so what kind of services
    are you offering under the become umbrella? Perhaps there&#39;s something more
    telling than an arrow counter, maybe even a slash 0 or a Question Mark. When I
    see the logo, I want to make it into a question: What do you want to become? <BR>
    <BR> <BR>getchatting: what is the company about? For some reason, flat edges seem
    more professional, rounded more fun and casual. <BR> <BR>There are some cool possibilities

    the type, this doesn&#39;t get rid of the contradiction between styles. In fact,
    I would think it would exaggerate it. Have you tried tweaking &#40;ultra-technical
    term&#41; the shapes of the other letters for better coordination?? One option
    could be &#40;besides minor tweaking, ergo loosening up&#41; thickening all of
