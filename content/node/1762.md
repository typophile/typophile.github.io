  body: No, please be my guest! If you can find which precise  <BR>Century it is,
    the credit is yours. I&#39;m busy &#40;x&#41;-ing and  <BR>tagging the threads.

  body: You can tell it&#39;s ITC Century because of the one-sided serif  <BR>on the
    right leg of the lowercase n. In all other versions,  <BR>this is a feature that
    only shows up in the bold weights.  <BR>Presumably, ITC did it for consistency.
    Call me old- <BR>fashioned, but it&#39;s always bugged the heck out of me.

  body: Brilliant spotting Adriano and Mark! Hey Chesh, we can  <BR>tell you&#39;re
    about to get married. Is it just my imagination  <BR>or do you visit less frequently
    these days? <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif" border=0>

  body: Well, I was on vacation for a week and was mostly deprived of email and almost
    completely deprived of web stuff. Other than that, I just haven&#39;t been getting
    the IDs like I used to. There&#39;s a ton of new talent on this board!

    <BR>Yeah, I know the feeling. First I thought I was getting  <BR>old, but I noticed
    it sort of comes and goes. You&#39;re right  <BR>about the new talent though.
    I wonder if this will show  <BR>in the statistics once the board bosses get to
    them.
