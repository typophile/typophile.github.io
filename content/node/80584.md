  trouble eyeballing/judging it. In fact if I hadn't read this to alert me to the
  task, I probably would have forgotten this important step in font design, because
  I don't see anything overtly wrong in the spaces of my new font, except for about
  3 places. When I do a google search, I can't find any help on this subject. I would
  really appreciate it if anyone could give me a few suggestions on what letters usually
  need kerning between the spaces that follow them, and/or whatever tips they could
  point me towards or supply me with. Any suggestions at all would help!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n"

    of the letters using the strings \u201CHH HH X HH HH\u201D and \u201Cnn nn x nn
    nn\u201D. Just be careful to not kern away too much space with wide versions of
    overhanging letters; I've seen text fonts where the space character almost disappears
    next to F or T."

  body: Dunwich, I don't get it. If you ever have a moment, please explain your method
    a little differently. What is this method based on and where did you learn it?
    BTW I don't do any serif fonts right now, so I'm not concerned with the way serifs
    affect kerning.
