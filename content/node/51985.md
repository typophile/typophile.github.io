  body: In his book on the Underground typeface, [[Justin Howes]] notes that [[Edward
    Johnston]] referred to this sample before he began drawing his face. Although
    there are some obvious differences between the Underground type and Caslon's sanserif,
    I think that the underlying structure is much the same.

  body: "<em>In his book on the Underground typeface, Justin Howes notes that Edward
    Johnston referred to this sample before he began drawing his face.</em>\r\n\r\nJust
    for the record, it may be worth pointing out that this isn\u2019t quite what Justin
    claimed. He suggested that the maker of the Egyptian and Edward Johnston might
    both have been independently using the capitals of the first William Caslon\u2019s
    roman type as a model. It\u2019s a point of view, although it\u2019s not one I
    agree with; and perhaps Justin would not have pushed the idea very far. At all
    events, it is unlikely that Johnston ever took any notice of the Caslon Egyptian.
    I think the resemblances between the two sanserif types, striking though some
    of them are, were coincidental. It would be safer to say that in both cases the
    model \u2013 at quite some distance \u2013 was inscriptional lettering. Johnston\u2019s
    type, although he claimed in 1937 that it was \u2018based on classical Roman capital
    proportions\u2019, has two letters, G and M, that resemble 15th-century Italian
    designs and have nothing to do with Rome, nor with the first Caslon type.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    trying to make a font based on the Caslon Egyptian has problems. The original
    type appears as a single line in a specimen that was issued by one of the two
    Caslon typefoundries in London in about 1816. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caslon
    - 2E Egyptian 2 a det a 500_3492.jpg]\r\nThe materials of this foundry were bought
    in 1818 by Blake, Garnett, a typefoundry newly established in Sheffield, Yorkshire,
    which recast the Egyptian in about 1838 under the name of <em>English two line
    Sans-Surryphs</em> and continued to show it in specimens until the 1850s, when
    the name of the foundry had become Stephenson, Blake. (Remember that \u2018English\u2019
    in the name of the type is the body above Pica; the \u2018two line\u2019 version
    was cast on a body roughly equivalent to 28 points.) The type then seems to vanish
    from British use, but rather strangely it appears as the <em>Two-line Small Pica
    Gothic</em> that can be seen as late as 1895 in the <em>Seventeenth book of specimens</em>
    of Mackellar, Smiths & Jordan, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2E
    Sans Surryphs 1838 500_3903.jpg]\r\nThe page above is from the specimen of Blake
    & Stephenson of about 1838. Several sorts in the newly cast type had changed for
    the worse. The new C was now a clumsy design, D was narrower than the original,
    and O had also been remade. You can see more detail of the original C in the image
    (which happens to be my own) that is used in the first post at the head of this
    thread. Had the first matrices been lost or damaged? We do not know, but it seems
    clear that whoever supplied the new ones was not a skilled operative. The surviving
    matrices are among the materials of Stephenson, Blake, now with the Type Museum,
    London. A fount was cast from them for Ian Mortimer, wood engraver and hand press
    printer in London, who printed a booklet on the type, <em>Caslon\u2019s Egyptian,
    the first sanserif type</em>, in 1988.\r\n\r\nSo recreating the \u2018original\u2019
    Egyptian type is not simple. It is not difficult to make a more authentic C, D
    and O from the showing of 1816, although copies of this are pretty heavily inked.
    But the punctuation in the surviving matrices is square, like that of some early
    slab-serif types. Is it original? There is no sure way of telling, since there
    is no punctuation in the original showing, which is one reason, among several,
    for thinking that the type was perhaps experimental and incomplete. There are
    no figures. And there is a curious kink halfway along the middle stroke of S,
    a sort that was not replaced.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dulwich
    Gallery sign 2 JM 5-2000 det 500_5389.jpg]\r\nJustin Howes and I both made our
    own digital versions of the Egyptian in 2000. Mine is called <em>Tivoli</em>,
    and I sometimes use it in my own work. Justin\u2019s was adopted for the exterior
    signs of the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, a building designed by John Soane,
    who was of course a pioneer user of sanserifs. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/English
    2 line Grotesque SB c1850 500_6380.jpg]\r\nWe were both unhappy with the G in
    the revived type, which can be seen in a specimen of the 1850s, above \u2013 a
    letter that it was vital to get right for the Dulwich project. We each made our
    own versions, based on drawn or architectural sanserif lettering of about 1800.
    I think it is fair to say that, after several experiments with different designs,
    some of which were interesting and some of them very odd, Justin adopted a G that
    was quite close to mine. They were both made by adapting the original C. I made
    a new Q too.\r\n\r\nOne might say that making a font of the original Caslon Egyptian
    is a bit like making Gutenberg\u2019s press. Since there is no complete authentic
    original to refer to, it calls for a leap of imagination."

  body: "I\u2019ll add to James Mosley\u2019s post: my <em>Micerino</em> is nothing
    else than an excercise directly based on James\u2019 own <em>Tivoli</em> type.
    Instead of using the source material \u2013 which I never had access too \u2013
    it tries to wrap bezier outlines around the traced glyphs in James\u2019 Type
    1 font. It also includes the alternate glyphs from Blake & Stephenson, also in
    James\u2019 own <em>Tivoli</em> and makes them available as OpenType stylistic
    alternates. For many reasons, chiefly my own incompetence at the time when I did
    it, it\u2019s an unsatisfactory typeface. The issues raised by James, Justin Howes\u2019
    version \u2013 which I wasn\u2019t aware of \u2013 and the Font Bureau type are
    enough for me to safely say I won\u2019t keep on working on this project for now.
    In fact I haven\u2019t been working on it since early 2007.\r\n\r\nBut as this
    thread attests, there is continued interest in the type: the Whitney museum has
    used one of the various versions \u2013 I think it\u2019s the Font Bureau one
    \u2013 for its <a href=\"http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=home\">Biennial

    material on the Caslon font, so perhaps the Figgins Sans can throw some light
    on the early days of sans.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Figgins_6688.png]\r\n\r\nOne
    thing to note is that the Figgins design varied significantly in different sizes,
    with, among other differences, square punctuation at one size, round at another.
    It's hard to know whether they were flummoxed as to how to execute this style,
    or were perhaps experimenting with the idea that more stroke contrast may be appropriate
    at larger sizes.\r\n\r\nI recently came across the Brevier size of the Figgins
    face in <em>Bentley's Miscellany</em>, November 1, 1837; so this is how sans faces
    were used in job work. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fig_Boz_Spread_5365.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Figgins_Boz_5029.jpg]"

  body: "I agree with Nick that the Figgins \u2018Sans-serif\u2019 types (so called)
    are well worth looking at. In fact it might be said to be that with these types
    the Figgins typefoundry brought the design into typography, since the original
    Caslon Egyptian appeared only briefly in a specimen and has never been seen in
    commercial use. One size of the Figgins Sans-serif appears in a specimen dated
    1828 (the unique known copy is in the University Library, Amsterdam). Here is
    an image from a specimen dated 1832.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1
    Figgins - 5P Sans-serif 1832 det 500_4143.jpg]\r\nIt is a self-confident design,
    which in the larger sizes abandons the monoline structure of the Caslon letter
    for a thick-thin modulation which would remain a standard model through the 19th
    century, and can still be seen in the ATF Franklin Gothic.\r\n\r\nNote that there
    is no lower-case. That would come, after 1830, with the innovative condensed \u2018Grotesque\u2019
    of the Thorowgood foundry, which provided a model for type that would get large
    sizes into the lines of posters. It gave an alternative name to the design, and
    both the new features \u2013 the condensed proportions and the addition of lower-case
    \u2013 broke the link with Roman inscriptional capitals.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2
    Thorowgood - 7P Grotesque 1834 2 a 500_6041.jpg]\r\nThe appearance of the Figgins
    and Thorowgood designs marks the acceptance of the sanserif in typography, after
    a long period when it can be found in other media but when its odd appearance
    and perhaps the lingering flavour of antiquarian associations seem to have deterred
    the typefounders. But the antiquarian associations of the design were still there,
    at least in the smaller sizes, as the specimen of the Pearl size (four and three
    quarters points) of Figgins\u2019s type shows. It uses the text of the Latin inscription
    prepared for the rebuilt London Bridge, which was opened on 1 August 1831.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3
