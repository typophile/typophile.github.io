  adult vocational training. They will be starting with no design experience. The
  class is seventy two hours in eight weeks. My great desire is to teach them true
  classic design including elegant and legible typography. Does anyone have syllabuses,
  lesson plans, pointers, warnings, and resources, which may help. If so, I would
  be grateful.\r\n"

    happy she offers that, for all, on the internet.\r\n\r\nDear David,\r\nDesigning
    with type by James Craig was my first pick as well. I know of type rules and will
    look up the other two. I also liked the \"the form of the book\" Jan Tschichold.
    what do you think of it?\r\n\r\nThank you both,\r\nPsachyah\r\n"
