  font design, and more specifically &#39;Making money from your fonts&#39;.  <BR>  <BR>
  I was wondering if anyone out there had experience of this - either selling their
  fonts, or using their &#39;free&#39; fonts as promotional tools that have led to
  other work. I will  probably  be looking to speak to a couple of people for the
  article, show off their work maybe, print their URL, etc. In it&#39;s own way, the
  article would be a nice way to promote your font design work maybe?  <BR>  <BR>
  Anyway, if you have time to email over the next couple of days, it would be really
  good to hear from you guys... Thanks! <BR>  <BR><a href="mailto:badgerbadger@badgerbadger.freeserve.co.uk">badgerbadger@badgerbadger.freeserve.co.uk</a>

  body: Your topic is incredibly broad. It might be a better idea to let us know what
    research you&#39;ve already done, what kind of audience will be reading your article
    and what holes you need filled to complete your article.  <BR> <BR>Most folks
    are here to assist each other in font design and might not see assisting a journalist
    as the most effective use of their time and effort.  You might do better narrowing
    your query down to a specific question and see if you get any responses you&#39;ll
    want to follow up through e-mail exchanges. <BR> <BR>Kristin <BR>who spent 10

  body: Jerome, <BR> <BR>I have been selling electronic fonts since 1987. Still, I
    do agree, the question is broad, and it is hard to finger some useful comments
    on this keyboard. <BR> <BR>For instance, I am not rich. If that is part of the
    question. <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Okay, some clarification. It&#39;s not for Computer Arts, but the sister
    magazine, Computer Arts Projects. They asked me to do this yesterday and I have
    until Tuesday &#40;5 days&#41; so it&#39;s a pretty tight deadline.  <BR> <BR>&#34;It
    might be a better idea to let us know what research you&#39;ve already done, what
    kind of audience will be reading your article and what holes you need filled to
    complete your article.&#34; <BR> <BR>Well I have several sites I&#39;ll be quoting,
    looking at, discussing etc. And the article will be quite practical based, to
    do with promotion of work, etc. The audience is the design community basically
    &#40;computer arts readers&#41; - not necessarily just typographers though, but
    designers who are looking to experiment, get into font design and would maybe
    like some advice/reassurance that it will be worth their while.  <BR>  <BR>&#34;Most
    folks are here to assist each other in font design and might not see assisting
    a journalist as the most effective use of their time and effort.&#34; <BR> <BR>This
    is a great opportunity for people to promote their work, their site, etc as the
    mag is the biggest selling of it&#39;s kind &#40;as far as I understand&#41;.
    We would of course credit you, and maybe even show some images of your work.  <BR>
    <BR>The main article is going to be about promoting your fonts, selling them online,
    selling them through your own site, etc - not about technical font design at all
    - more theory based. So, it would be great to hear from anyone who has tried,
    or who has made money from font design. So that could be directly selling fonts,
    or having a &#39;donation&#39; button on your site, or using your font design
    as a promotional tool. If you have any anecdotes that are relevant, that would
    be great - people like to hear that kind of practical stuff based on real experiences.
    So if that&#39;s you, feel free to email me and then I&#39;ll send some more specific
    questions.  <BR> <BR>Hope that clarifies things a bit. Thanks. '
