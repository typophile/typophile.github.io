  I am still looking for last minute suggestions on hidden, secret spots and things
  to do and see, 'over there'. What Ive already planned is not that much. I may be
  taking a look at the (Barnbrook) 'Friendly Fire' exhibition at The London Design
  Museum. I will of course be visiting the places Ive lived and worked the last times
  Ive been there. Lil' Old Truman Brewery, here I come. ;)\r\n\r\nAs always, I am
  very, very thankful for all suggestions and hints.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDav"

    Their main exhibition area is awe-inspiring.
