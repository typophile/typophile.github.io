body: "I'm looking for the right Bembo. I've checked out Bembo Book and Bembo MT.
  Bembo MT is a touch too thin, and Bembo Book's x-height is too low for my liking---I
  prefer Aldine 401's proportions, and Bergamo's even more. Neither Aldine 401 nor
  Bergamo are dark enough to go well, as far as I can see, with Gill, which is what
  I'd like to pair them with. I would be writing articles, and the occasional book.
  I guess what I'm looking for is a dark Bembo with Bergamo's proportions (or similar).*
  Any ideas?\r\n\r\n*I've heard of Berthold Bembo, and looked at some pdfs, but I
  don't know how to get it."

    by Bembo. And it was designed even to produce a proper grade of darkness on the
    page, which other Bembos (you mentioned) fail to do. \u2013 Any questions welcome.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-freefont/|Here

    rendition of the Venetian serif:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ludwiguebele.de/item.php/Typefaces/Text/Text/Augustin/\r\n\r\nI've
    nevere tried it but it should work nicely for a text setting, instead of the digital
    Bembo."

    any costs.\r\nI remember Berthold indeed advertised (in <cite>U&lc</cite>) a Bembo
    BQ designed by the master G\xFCnter Gerhard Lange sometime in the 1990s, but I
    have never seen it."
