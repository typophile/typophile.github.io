body: "Hey,\r\nBecause of the rather coarse resolution/grid of 1000 upm, the shape
  easily gets distorted by adding nodes at extremes. Especially in a really thin italic
  design. Would anyone mind sharing how you tackle this problem? Is it ok to leave
  some curves, like the bend of an italic lc \"t\", unoptimized?"

  body: Hmmm, I can remember only very few occasions when a curve did not benefit
    from nodes at extremes. This has usually happened in tiny shapes like the slightly
    bulging tip of a hairline serif. Why don't you post an example?

  body: I would leave it as it is or "optimize" this section manually while having
    the original letter in the mask layer. Sometimes you can get the same shapes if
    you twist the points a little bit here and there, and pull a few handles.
