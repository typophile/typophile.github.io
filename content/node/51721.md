  body: Valid comment. The answer is because a) I'm the world's worst artist, and
    b) I'm a perfectionist. I did end up hand-drawing the words, but the weights of
    the strokes are all wrong and the curves are funky and I know it... Not to mention
    that at some point I have to include a fir tree and a star into my non-logo. *sigh*
