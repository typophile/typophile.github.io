    the type is also based on an early 20th Century metal type, but haven\u2019t found
    a match yet.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a cleaned-up version of the text, in case someone
    else wants a go at it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_2001_5470.JPG]"

  body: "Helpful to have this. Looking at the photo I think some narrowing is needed.
    Some further tinkering of letters with some distinctive features.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LovingLVGWdetailSM_3555.jpg]\r\nNo
    match with my early 20th century specimens.\r\nThis looks like it was machine
    engraved within the past couple of years.\r\nThe best bet might be to identify
    the company that made the monument and find out what they call the lettering.
    \r\nCould be a font for monument makers that does not have a retail digital match.\r\nIf
    all else fails we could look for slab-serif and stub serif fonts that have this
    type of concave leg or banana shaped leg on the _R_. Seems to be a little chin
    on _G_.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks for your help guys, Greatly appreciated. I'll look at slab serif and
    stub serif fonts. Other masons unfortunately are not as kind when it comes to
    revealing the fonts they have used.  Purely because if we don't match exactly
    it looks bad on us. Again thanks for the advice.
