  font is Futura Bold and have several international locations. Among them, they have
  have several locations in China. As I have no clue on how Asian fonts work, would
  anyone here have any suggestions on a good companion to Futura Bold that supports
  unicode characters? (The closest I've been able to get is Arial Unicode, but would
  like something better). \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\ndm\r\n\r\n"

  body: A lot of Korean fonts have a geometric style similar to Furtura, but I can't
    say for other languages.

  body: "Korean fonts in general won't have Simplified Chinese characters, so they
    will be useless for Mainland Chinese. What you are looking for is a clean <em>hei</em>
    (sans-serif) Simplified Chinese font. Take a look at Wikipedia's article on <a
    href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_gothic_typeface\">East Asian gothic
    typefaces</a> and take a look at the options available. In addition to the typefaces
    listed there, Monotype and Linotype offer <em>hei</em> Simplified Chinese fonts
    with a large range of weights.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about Chinese typefaces
    to judge the choices; hopefully we'll have some better input from a native Chinese
    designer. And please don't use Arial Unicode, whose non-Latin components are poorly
    designed."

  body: "@jongseong Thanks for the info! This is very helpful. As far as Arial is
    concerned, I'm unfortunately stuck with it for now - as this is a web project
    and Arial Unicode is widely available on most platforms. If I can find something
    better that supports hei, I can embed those characters and not have to look upon
    Arial again :) \r\n\r\nIn this day and age, it really is unfortunate that we're
    still limited to the same 6 fonts on the web. HTML 5 promises to help somewhat
    on that front, but I still think there are better solutions that need to happen...like
    a mandate stating that all ugly fonts need to be destroyed. Everywhere.\r\n\r\n--\r\nD

  body: "Cheer up. You're not stuck with Arial Unicode. The vast majority of your
    users will have professional Simplified Chinese fonts on their system. Windows
    users will have SimHei or MSHei for example.\r\n\r\nSo you just need to specify
    a number of these widely available fonts in your stylesheet, and the vast majority
    of your users will be able to find a font in their system that matches at least
    one of the choices. I highly doubt you'll be able to find native Chinese-language
    content on the web that specifies Arial Unicode as the first-choice font family.\r\n\r\nArial
    Unicode is a fallback font. It allows Simplified Chinese to be displayed on systems
    that cannot find dedicated fonts. Otherwise they'd appear as boxes. That's a powerful
    raison d'\xEAtre in itself, but it's also pretty much the extent of Arial Unicode's
    usefulness."
