body: "Is it possible to place a document containing text into multiple Indesign files
  and then style that text differently in each of the multiple indesign files? What
  I want to do is maintain a single text document for text that I use to proof all
  of my different fonts without having to change that fonts in used in the original
  every time I need to print a proof. And if this isn\u2019t possible in Indesign,
  is there some other option?"

  body: "In InDesign, go to Preferences > Type > Links, and select \"Create Links
    When Placing Text and Spreadsheet Files.\"\r\n\r\nAfter placing a text doc, it
    will appear in your Links palette, and will display the yellow \"I've been modified\"
    triangle when you make changes to the original text doc.\r\n\r\nThe challenge
    comes when you update the link. Any changes you've made to the file in InD (such
    as applying styles) are wiped out, which would defeat your purpose. \r\n\r\nI've
    not tested this, but I believe the workaround would be to create and apply style
    sheets in your word processor, then modify those style sheet attributes in InD.
    (Assuming that you've set your text import preferences to bring along the word
    processor's style sheets, of course.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: InDesign can be set up to import style names, disregarding their definitions
    -- thus using the styles in the InDesign document. Check the Word Import options.

  body: "It's not clear from your post if you need to be able to change the text once
    for all the InDesign various documents. If this is the case, in order to retain
    the styles set in InDesign, your best bet is explore the data merge capabilities
    of InDesign (search \"data merge\" in the Help).\r\nIf the text will not change...
    I didn't understand your request! ;-)"

  body: "you could automatically create a document with indesign markup language that
    contains text in your different styles. there's also this other, simple html-like
    markup-language that does the same. but i couldn't find its specs or name right
    now.\r\nalso take a look at javascript-scripting within indesign."
