  body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nThe snake/caduceus has a mohawk hair-do. The type used for
    Torrington is too severe- harsh. I would suggest a more 'graceful' font. Also
    I think the type should be a titling face as that was Eidict Neo- am I correct?-
    is more for text work. Also the sans (Gotham?) is blacker in appearance that Torrington
    which I'm not sure how that will play out in print.\r\n\r\nAs for which logo right
    now... the bottom one. As a person unfamiliar with the Torrington name/brand I
    would not grasp that the caduceus is representing the letter 'i' and not just
    a dividing element.\r\n\r\nWhat are your colors for the design? Make sure the
    colors convey the feelings medical/science, natural, healing. I think you know
    I mean. Don't do everything in medical 'blue'.\r\n\r\nAll my best to you...\r\n\r\nMikey
    :-)"

  body: "'Matthew A' seems to just be plopped on top with no real rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    consider a much more horizontal layout. More of a formal letterhead from the past:\r\n\r\nMatthew
    A TORRINGON md\r\n\r\nUse the same size type, but set it all on one line."

  body: "Shouldn\u2019t the caduceus snake be curled round a winged staff?\r\nAgreeing
    with Mikey on the type choice but, if you stay with the present style, kerning
    needs to be sorted, especially the Os and G. In the second version, which I prefer,
    the forename doesn\u2019t have a relationship with the surname and the letterspacing
    is too great, I would also look at removing the stop after A.\r\n\r\nTim"

      I think it's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius\">Rod
      of Asclepius</a>, not a Caduceus, in which case it's appropriate without wings."

  body: "The fonts used were Eidetic and Clearview. Both slightly modified.\r\nClearview
    was a custom weight (by hand) with a slightly lowered crossbar on the \"H\", and
    the serif Eidetic was modified by adding a larger shoulders on the \"R\"'s.\r\nA
    lot of custom type design, as well as icons were created on previous versions
    that were\r\nnot picked by client, but these were the final two and at this stage
    these are the only two\r\nI will be showing, so we can get the project finished
    and implemented. To give proper credit, the icon and the positioning of the type
    was created by my business partner Bradley Bishop.\r\nI picked the type faces
    and did the final modifications and re-traced the icon.  \r\n"
