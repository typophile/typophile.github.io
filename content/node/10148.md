  body: Sebastian why not making the type as unnoticible as possible to allow the
    illustrations to be the star of your book. Just a nice clean legible &#40;forgetable&#41;
    serif for the text. And if you want the headlines to be fun I&#39;d look at something
    from Font Diner or House Industries.

  body: I would think that it is important first to see the style of the illustrations,
    and the space they take up, how the type will fit in, and how much text you have.
    Also the emotional tone. Is it warm and fuzzy, or scary or funny? Then you could
    narrow down what would work a lot better.

  body: Sorry to come late to the party. But as a parent can I make a plea. Please
    consider whether this is &#40;1&#41; a book to be read by children or &#40;2&#41;
    a book to be read to children. If it is a book to be read to children then remember
    you are actually setting type for adults to read. <BR> <BR>In any event, I have
    observed that my 6 year old son seems to have very little trouble with &#34;adult&#34;
    letters &#40;two-storey a, hourglass g&#41;, and even with script types. He gets
    puzzled if type is made to run in weird patterns, where it is physically hard
    to read &#40;e.g., on dark backgrounds&#41;, where it is highly condensed. He
    seems to like large word-spaces, which I suppose makes sense since he definitely
    reads word-by-word still. <BR> <BR>Whatever you do please, please, please do not
    use Bembo Schoolbook. My other pet hate is scribbly looking scripts, which get
    very monotonous. OK for a little display I suppose, but if people want a short
    story to look handwritten, could they not try ... writing it by hand?
