  body: "The lettering looks like it was done with a flat pen as a softened version
    of a Textura design with Anglicized capitals. The repeating letters seem pretty
    much the same, so I suspect this was a font from the photo lettering era that,
    as far as I can find out has not been digitized.\r\nI can offer substitutes that
    have some of the flavor of the lettering, mainly for the lower case, but are not
    all that close:\r\nKingthings Petrock Pro\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/kingthings-petrock-pro/\r\nClaudius\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/claudius/\r\nFine

  body: I think Don is right. The spacing and continuity in forms tend to say "phototype".
    I too tried to find it but I have very little in the way of British specimens.
    Decca was originally a British label so the cover may have been done there.
