  body: "Typeface names can become Trademarks (or Registered Trademarks). I do not
    know what the procedure is to do this myself. But I would recommend doing it.\r\n\r\nYou
    cannot *copyright* a typeface name, I think. You can only copyright the source
    code of a font. Font source code data may be copyrighted as a literary work, like
    other computer programs. This is done through the copyright office of the country
    you live in (I believe that the US Copyright Office is in Washington, D.C.). Other
    countries have copyright agreements with the US; therefore, it is usually not
    necessary to register this copyright elsewhere.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Chris, what are you intending to protect legally?\r\nAs Dan mentioned, a
    typeface name (a name of an actual product) can be trademarked after a moderate
    search of like sounding and spelling names within the industry or market of the
    product.\r\n\r\nA registered trademark requires extensive tradename research (legal
    fees) before you can even apply, then more application fees, a period open for
    contention, then more legal fees for actual registration. It's really all about
    \"trade\" protection, or to disuade \"competitors\" from capitalizing on the brand
    investment and product name equity of the originating company.\r\n\r\nIf a \"brand\"
    is big enough or well known enough, its protection will go beyond the actual product
    category and marketplace. An example would be if you tried to register a trademark
    for a typeface named <em>Corvette</em>.\r\n\r\nA name won't protect the typeface
    itself, if that's what you're hoping to do. If you are interested in \"branding\"
    a typeface, it requires more than just protecting the name as well.\r\n\r\nLet
    me know... I'll help if I can."

  body: "Well, here's a sure-fire way to protect your typeface names and build a brand
    for yourself, and it will only cost you another beer at TypeCon Boston this summer.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Brand
    Thy Self</strong></em>\r\nI've been both fascinated and enamored of your user
    handle \"dezcom\" (and I vaguely remember what it stands for, but that's neither
    here nor there in the matter). It's a fairly small field of type foundries and
    designers, so branding yourself will stand as both memorable and irrefutable as
    to the source of any of your typefaces.\r\n\r\nDezcom NOW, or Dez Leporello, or
    Dz Align Sans, or CL NOW, all can easily be branded and trademarked at the same
    time since your \"prefix\" becomes the actual distiguishing name.\r\n\r\nIt's
    why Aaron Burns <em>insisted</em> that \"ITC\" preceded every licensed release
    (except for the few ITC sub-licensed) and why several type suppliers and vendors
    still use prefixes today. But personally, I think \"Dezcom\" or even \"Dez\" is
    quite catchy, and you can even use your avatar as a brandmark.\r\n\r\nTrying to
    trademark and brand three new type families is far more difficult and costly than
    building a single brand with three available products (in this case typefaces).\r\n\r\nNow
    if that's not worth a beer, I don't know what is. :-O"

    be enough for me. Let's say you name Leporello \"Dez Leporello\", and someday
    soon a competitor names his typeface \"Dis Leporello\". This is no good. \r\n\r\nIn
    the future, should automatic internet searches dominate the way people find fonts,

    thing to do to threaten someone else with trademark infringement, but sometimes

    This brewery is run by the former Bavarian royal family (oh how the mighty have
