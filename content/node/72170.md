body: "I have modified a font to create the logotype of a clothing accessories company
  that I'm starting. Some of the changes I've made was changing the \"B\" to look
  more like the \"O\" at the end so that the letter forms create almost a mirror symmetry
  (i.e. the F mimics the A, the U mimics the N, and the B mimics the O). Originally
  the B was not curved off as much as it is here. This, in comparison to the other
  letters made the B seem smaller and weaker. To compensate, I shortened the stem
  height of the U at the top and the F, A, and N at the bottoms. Based of a height
  of 72 points in illustrator, I reduced them by one point in one version and by 2
  points in another. I'm really pulling hairs here, but thought I'd open it up to
  the community here to see if anyone had an opinion.\r\n\r\nP.S. I've also made other
  changes to the original by making them all exactly the same width (not by stretching
  the whole letter, but by moving the stem node by node to keep the integrity of the
  line weights). I also modified the middle \"bridge\" (don't know the actual typographic
  term for them) element of the F and the A so they were at the same height and had
  the same thickness. I changed the humps of all the letters (like the top of the
  F, the A, and the N) so they all had the same curved shape, etc.\r\n\r\nSo here
  are my questions to the community:\r\n\r\n1. Do you have an opinion on which stem
  height looks more right to you?\r\n\r\n2. Are there any overall glaring issues anyone
  has given I've tweaked the original font quite a bit. I'm being as sensitive as
  I can using what I know about typography, but haven't officially taken classes in
  it, so I'm open to criticism.\r\n\r\n3. If anyone would like to see the progression
  of how I got to this point, I'd be happy to post that as well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bufano_stemcomparison_4919.jpg]"

  body: "You need to reduce the height of U a little bit more to optically balance
    it with the curved tops of all the other letters. At the moment it looks taller
    even though it is actually a little shorter.\r\n\r\nI don't notice any difference
    between your two different overall heights, except when you overlay them. I like
    FANO. There is a nice, chunky, slightly-industrial look to them.\r\n\r\nI think
    you need to do something with B to make the top loop a little smaller than the
    bottom. It looks a bit top-heavy at the moment."

  body: "@Justin_Ch - Thank you!\r\n\r\nI had forced the original B (which originally
    has a flat left side) to look more like the O. I liked how it looked but couldn't
    put my finger on why it looked slightly off. Here's a modified version of the
    B.\r\n\r\nRegarding the optical height of the rest of the letters, I had already
    reduced the height of the middle 4 letters significantly from the original font
    to give it more balance with the \"B\". Unfortunately, when I reduce the height
    just one more point, it starts looking unbalanced to me. I think I'm going to
    stick with the way it is now unless someone screams bloody murder.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bufano_stemcomparison2_5716.jpg]"

  body: "the U and the N do look a bit weird. The U in particular breaks the rhythm...as
    has been said.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative...perhaps you can scale the B and O as
    added punctuation on the ends of the excellently bold type.\r\n\r\nthe B could
    probably be a bit wider (...as much as you've made it the same as the O), and
    sit closer to the U"

  body: "Thanks, Ratbaggy. \r\n\r\nThe U and the N are very close to the original
    font and actually work quite well outside the logotype. You guys are all definitely
    pros as you have taken the things that I've changed about the original letters
    and spotted them instantly as \"mistakes\".\r\n\r\nMy question, is how critical
    does a logo need to be typographically correct? What I had determined as king
    were the following:\r\n\r\n1. That all 6 letters are exactly the same width. I
    know this is breaking the rules since part of what gives letters in a family balance
    is varying their shapes and sizes slightly. Instead, I was aiming for having perfect
    symmetry. 6 letters. All exactly the same width.\r\n\r\n2. I wanted a B that looked
    interesting on its own. The original B does work better as a font letter. But
    as a logo identity (I'm imagining it as a belt buckle for example), this stylized
    curvy one, I like better. Unfortunately, now that I twisted the B away from its
    original more blocky shape, it's throwing all the pro's off on the \"U\". Poor
    \"U\". It wasn't his fault, lol.\r\n\r\n3. Again to achieve perfect symmetry (if
    I wanted to stack them in a pattern on a fabric, for example), I can't space them
    closer or further apart. Each letter is not only exactly the same width, but spaced
    exactly the same amount of space from each other.\r\n\r\nI love this website.
    You guys all called me out instantly on what was wrong, even though I had done
    it intentionally.\r\n\r\n@ riccard0\r\nI did try cutting the stems matching the
    curve of the \"O\" as reference as an option a while back. Although it looked
    interesting, the \"F\", \"A\", and \"N\" started looking like fangs so I had to
    pull it back to the original blocky shapes.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the feedback.
    This is great."

    and what if you only do this to the top of the U?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bufano10_4481.jpg]\r\n\r\nStill
    a bit fang-like, but at least ... Or had you already tried that?"

  body: 'U and n need to be narrower than the O and B because they have more white
    inside. I''d even make U slightly narrower than n. I also think the U in the post
    before mine is moving in the right direction. Perhaps those innermost nodes shouldn''t
    be that high. Your F needs less space on it''s right side. Type isn''t about math,
    it''s about optics. Here''s an idea for you: if you double up that A, and make
    two legs (the first one''s right, and the second one''s left) overlap, you only
    need to remove a slice of the top and the crossbar to get a nice mirroring. '
