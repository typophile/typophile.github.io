body: "I have a brief for an A4 prospectus that will have a glossy outer cover, and
  silk art inner, all printed offset litho.\r\n\r\nAs the school wants to promote
  a modern, technological look I would like to use Meta for the cover masthead, and
  inner headlines. I know it's omniscient these days but it has the right amount of
  personality without decending into technogimickyness...\r\n\r\nI would like to buy
  PMNCaecilia as a standfirst typeface where some pages will have a preamble narrative.
  \r\n\r\nHowever, I am undecided on what to use as a body type... I'm inclined to
  stick with meta, as I don't want to extend to 3 faces on a page, so my feeling is
  to only choose something other than Meta for body if it presents readability problems.\r\n\r\nI'd
  be grateful for advice if anyone has done anything similar (which I'm sure you have!),
  and if my type choices are wrong diddly wrong.\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: I think Caecilia works wonderfully for text.

  body: "I'll have to produce a couple of demo pages to show them I think... I'm not
    sure if using Caecilia for body as well as a standfirst would imbalance things.
    I felt that sandwiching Caecilia in between two Sans faces would look more balanced.\r\n\r\nNo
    way of knowing unless you try though. Will post an update."
