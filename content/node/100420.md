  body: "Thanks for the responses everyone!\r\n\r\nI have asked the author, but he
    hasn't responded. First prize would be a positive response, but unfortunately
    the deadline is looming, so not sure I can wait much longer.\r\n\r\nbartd: The
    way the bowls and stems in the lower-case connect is something that has never
    seemed quite right to me. \r\n\r\nhrant: I totally agree. I'd rather not have
    something that's too common. I was looking at  [[http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Replica/|Replica]]
    but it's quite pricey. (I'm in South Africa and the conversion rate is harsh)\r\n\r\nsatya:
    That is really beautiful, when is the release date? "
