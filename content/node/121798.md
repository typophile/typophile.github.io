  would appreciate any comments.\r\nThanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kari_font_01_3589.jpg]"

  body: I like the overall feeling. However, the gaps placement seems pretty arbitrary.
    Also |U| looks boxy, and |X| doesn't work for me.

  body: I like it - it has a clean gentle Beatrix Potter feel. The extremely small
    x-height does not hinder legibility . The |f| is incongruous with its prominent
    capital-F-like stroke.  The irregularity of the shapes is pleasing and gives a
    hand-made effect .. it reminded me somewhat of the new font being promoted for
    easy reading by dyslexics who cannot recognise symmetrical shape like q,p,b,d,
    so the glyphs are made irregular.  The gaps are OK and might well serve another
    purpose - someone on typophile was recently looking for a font without closed
    counters for laser cutting. Good luck.

  body: 'The ''f'' really interrupts reading to me in your sample. It looks too much
    like a capital letter.  The apostrophe and quote marks seem slightly too high
    to me. '

  body: "It looks pretty, but I think you might need to compromise on that a little
    to make it easier to read. I think it would get tiring on the eyes to read a whole
    story in it. I would make the gaps smaller, perhaps even just touching, almost
    imperceptibly so that they still look like gaps. I would also make the x-height
    a bit bigger compared with the cap/ascender height.\r\n\r\nThe stroke thicknesses
    look a bit inconsistent to me, although I'm not sure if that's just a rasterising
    effect in the bitmap: the fact that two lower-case l's look different make me
    think that it's that. Although the serifs do need to be more consistent... compare
    the top of the l with the top of the b. The exclamation point and question mark
    are more stylised than the letters, which may have been deliberate and look good
    in context, but to me, in this context, it looks a little jarring.\r\n\r\nDon't
    get me wrong, I think it's a really nice font. And with a few more tweaks, I think
    it will be more than just nice."
