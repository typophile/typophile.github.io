body: "<code>set \"p=path to directory with fonts with spaces in path\"\r\nfor %%f
  in (\"%p%\\*.*\") do tx -pdf -dd \"%p%\" -a \"%%f\"</code>\r\n\r\nI wonder, why
  this did not work:\r\n\r\n<code>for %%f in (\"path to directory with fonts with
  spaces in path\\*.*\") do tx -pdf -dd \"%%~dpf\" -a \"%%f\"</code>\r\n\r\nThe dd-option
  does not seem to like a backslash in the end of a path. You may also have a view
  in the thread <strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/70992\">Easy way to generate
  a Glyph/Character</a>.</strong>"
