body: There is quite a lot written on the form of letters -- structures, balances,
  styles etc etc, but seemingly very little written on the actual digital construction
  of the forms themselves. It seems to me that when you get your head around general
  principles of letters, you're expected to bumble through the digitalisation process,
  working out bezier principles through trial and error. Now I'm not saying there
  is anything wrong with this process per se -- observing how others have done it,
  and trying yourself. But, it just doesnt seem there is enough documented on this
  subject. I can only really say that leslie carbarga's font and logo lettering bible
  is all I've come across that touches on this subject -- and even this isn't all
  that helpful. I could be looking in all the wrong places of course?

  body: If you don't like beziers that much, draw it out first, then trace in vector
    prog. or font prog. It's pretty much trial and error. Lots of error. It'll start
    coming to ou, but it takes some time.

    still need to play with beziers, and as you know there are  better ways of drawing
    with them than others. Surely there are some sources of information in this area?\r\n"

  body: "Great question, dux.\r\n\r\nThe Fontlab manual for 4.6 was an index of functions,
    rather than an explanation of how to use the functions in drawing and production.
    The new manual for 5.0 I am just starting to look at, and it seems to be quite
    a bit better written, but still an index of functions. \r\n\r\nLeslie Cabarga's
    'Learn Fontlab Fast' is essential reading as it starts to explain the 'How to'
    of using the functions. --Do you know this book?\r\n\r\nStill, it is only a start.
    The \"How to\" Section here in the Typowiki has a lot of good stuff also, thanks
    to experienced pros like John Hudson and David Berlow, who have written stuff
    in threads that have been posted there. \r\n\r\nHere are a couple of things I
    have gleaned from Typophile or by trial and error or elsewhere, confirmed on Typophile.
    \r\n\r\n<strong>Task</strong>: Revising glyphs to get 'best version.'\r\n<strong>How
    to</strong>: Paste the existing glyph to mask before starting revisions. That
    way you know what you are changing, and can easily go back selectively, and not
    only by 'undo'. I put the 'mask' tool bar on the desk top so it is instantly accessible.
    Also, revise in context. Have the preview window open, big enough to see the curves
    but small enough to see the context of a number of side-by-side glyphs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Task</strong>:
    Smoothing out 'bumps' and fixing awkward curves.  \r\n<strong>How to</strong>:
    Make use of the shift key. With the shift key down, if you click and hold on a
    non-selected bezier node you can slide it while keeping the bezier handle points
    fixed. This sometimes magically takes out bumps, where moving the handles around
    trying to do the same thing will just drive you crazy. Also, with the shift key
    down clicking on a non-selected handle point while enable you to drag the handle
    point while keeping the handle the same angle and the node fixed. Being able to
    move either the node while keeping the handles fixed or visa versa really gives
    you a lot more control in fixing curves. You can, for example, first take out
    the lump moving the node, then fix the resulting curve by moving the handles.
    \ \r\n\r\nThere are no doubt more and better ways for these two tasks, and for
    sure a lot more good guidelines for other tasks in drawing and production; I would
    love to learn other people's techniques on these and other tasks. The best could
    go to the Typowiki 'How to'."

  body: "Luke, \r\n\r\nHere are some axioms that can help you get better-quality outlines:
    \r\n\r\nUse the fewest number of points (segments) to achieve your desired outline.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    do not cheat the design by skimping on points where they are necessary.\r\n\r\nPlace
    points on the extrema (top, bottom, left, right) of any curve. Those may be all
    you need for certain shapes. The points on extrema help rasterizers align letters
    with their neighbors via hints.\r\n\r\nDo a lot of digitization in the environment
    (software) you expect to use primarily. Though Illustrator and FontLab employ
    beziers, the behavior of certain tools in Illustrator is not as useful for letter
    design as the type drawing tools in FL. \r\n\r\nIf you follow the above guides,
    and spend time digitizing, you will see there's not much to document. "

  body: ">Place points on the extrema (top, bottom, left, right) of any curve.\r\n\r\nAh,
    that brings up an important question. This rule about extrema is often said, but
    also often broken. For example, if you open up Adobe Garamond Pro, and turn on
    'font audit', you will see that practically every serif is drawn without an extremum,
    and is flagged for possible correction. \r\n\r\nI find it hard to believe that
    Slimbach doesn't know what he is doing, and I think I read somewhere that defining
    the extrema is important for the stems and arcs, but not for small terminals,
    such as that on the e, which are not normally hinted anyway, I believe. \r\n\r\nCan
    some of you tech mavens clarify when putting points on extrema is important and
    when not?\r\n\r\nFor me, sometimes I haven't been able to make some convex curves
    at terminals look good with nodes placed at the extrema. Concave curves seem to
    be more amenable to accepting the extrema.  "

  body: "Hey guys --\r\n\r\nGreat feedback. I'm sure lots of people will find this
    as helpful as I do. I'm aware of learn fontlab fast. I think I read it about 10
    times before even applying the tips and tricks. The extrema rule exception is
    particularly interesting. I suppose I'm always trying to make my shapes as smooth
    and beautiful as possible, but there are times when creating uglier forms is necessary
    -- such as a really solid book face. I guess this is just like not skimping on
    points to stay true to your shapes -- if you need to break the extrema rule to
    achieve a shape, that's what you have to do."

    as an 18 point type and keep it readable. It needs lower contrast and shorter
    extenders. But this doesn't mean it has to be ugly. The distortions for the sake
    of legibility, such as in the joins, don't have to be so great at normal text
    sizes to make the characters ugly. "
