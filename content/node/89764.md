body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have in my head an idea for a typeface, which I feel sure someone
  has already designed, but it's a case of tracking it down.I am looking for a readable
  typeface, that has decorative alt fonts, and a friendly feel.\r\n\r\nThe first part,
  without the friendliness, can be done by typefaces such as Barnbrook's Priori Sans,
  and Priori Sans Alt.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/priori-sans-ot/regular/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/priori-sans/regular-alt/\r\n\r\nBut
  I need something that's a little more friendly, but achieving the same affect.\r\n\r\nSome
  typefaces I've looked at so far, which are creative and friendly, but too informal:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/party_time/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_jambalaya_com/\r\n\r\nOne
  typeface I've come across that's heading in the right direction, but has no legible
  interchangeable font:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_yokkmokk_ot_regular/\r\n\r\nOr
  equally: http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_polymorph_ot/, combined
  with Polymorph North, but it's still not quite there.\r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions
  would be fantastic.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n"
