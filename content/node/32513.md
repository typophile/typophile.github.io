  below. It's my own logo, always the hardest.\r\n\r\nAll I want is for it to look
  natural, smooth and flowing. Effortless I suppose. Can you identify any lines that
  look wrong?\r\n\r\nThe font is modified Monterey from Bitstream:\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Get out brush and ink, load the brush, loosen up with a few dozen practices,
    let fly, try different size brushes and from different distances, standing or
    sitting, eventually you will produce a smooth logo that you can digitize, the
    lettering look you are after is nearly always best done on paper first rather
    than by altering a typeface.\r\n\r\nI realise that isn\u2019t what you were looking
    for, an alternative might be to print it out at varying sizes and sketch over
    them, the main problems I see is the form of the v which can easily be mistaken
    for u, the lack of variation of the the right side and the joining stroke from
    o to x creates a light space in the centre and the last stroke of the x (that
    travels up to the top right) could be more exuberant, the typeface is built to
    work in extended setting (well, as extended as you would want to see a brush script)
    and so is restricted by the requirements of typesetting methods, a brush script
    logo is rarely used in close conjunction with similar text so can/should be more
    in nearly every direction.\r\n\r\nTim"

      I'll post up the results.

  body: "I think the information at the 'typies' site is misleading. For example,
    he shows the elimination of intermediate points between extrema as a way to improve
    curves. Often this is true, but sometimes not. You can see intermediate points
    in the letters of masters such as Matthew Carter and Robert Slimbach and many
    others. \r\n\r\nSo the directive to eliminate intermediate points, with no qualification,
    is misleading. Personally, I find I need to try it both ways and see what gets
    me the best result: I try first with no intermediate point; if that works, fine.
    If not, try an intermediate point. Then when you get the curve pretty near what
    you like, copy the outline to mask and test eliminating the intermediate point.
    If that works, fine. If not, keep the intermediate point. \r\n\r\nI find one of
    the most useful tools in eliminating bumps is to slide the node while keeping
    the handles fixed--then moving the handles later. [In FontLab, that's shift-click
    to drag the node or handle only.] All this with your starting point copied to
    mask.\r\n\r\nI would be interested in the comments of others on when they find
    intermediate points helpful, and when not.    \r\n"

      That article sounds interesting.\r\n\r\nRegarding the name, it sits very comfortably
      with me. No, it's not completely original, but it will be to most of my clients.
      Also the letters look great together, and it's easy to spell.\r\n\r\nI'm off
      to buy brushes and ink, any tips on what to get?"

  body: i agree with the ink and brush suggestion. the main problem with the logo
    at this point is the uniform size of the letters, which makes it feel anything
    but smooth, flowing and effortless. have some fun with it.

  body: i think it's just a question of capturing the spirit. a great example is just
    to the right of your screen... look how veer used the script to create a hip,
    lively feel. you can feel it particularly when you study the two "e" forms side
    by side; they let them each have a life, slightly separate from the other.

      I can see is Veer. I'm trying some other aproaches as well.

    at extrema with your bcp's absolutely horizontal or vertical. Your main goal is
    to get your shapes right, when your satisfied copy the shape to a mask layer and
    add points at the extrema and delete the ones not needed anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n***********************************************\r\nnew
