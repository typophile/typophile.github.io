body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI was wondering how georgia and verdana were made to fit
  the screen. Is it just an endless process of testing? Then I came up with an idea.
  If I make a grid in Typetool at the size the pixels would be when at 12 points.
  The same thing could be done for other point sizes, so I'll make different versions
  for different sizes. The idea is not to make a pixel based font, but a contour that
  is made to fit the pixels. Am I the first to think of this? Is there any chance
  it will work? How can I find out how much space there has to be between the lines
  of the grid in order for them to align with the pixels? Any help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard"

    engineered from three different bitmap sizes.\r\nThe contours were then wrapped
    around the bitmaps."

    about franky. This page says nothing about how franky was made.

  body: "I don't see the difference between fitting the pixels to the contours and
    fitting the contours to the pixels. You'd end up with a pretty similar result
    either way. As far as making different versions for different point sizes, that
    is basically the concept behind truetype hinting. The hints trigger which pixels
    are used to render the letterforms at every ppem size.\r\n\r\nSo it'd be tough
    to call this an original idea. Perhaps, you could call it an original perspective
    on hinting.\r\n\r\nYou could explore how the design of the letterforms influences
    the ease and quality of the hinting, as well as maintain the typeface's design
    identity at low resolutions.\r\n\r\nTwo pages to check out about TT Hinting and
    ppem sizes (respectively) are:\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeHintingVersus.mspx\r\nand

    andrevy, too \u2014 the article shows how hinting works when one tries to retain
    lettershapes, which implies that it can also work the other way round.)"
