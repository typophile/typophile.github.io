  together, and am struggling a bit with the margins.\r\nAccording to some traditional
  type setters the margins should be applied according to the golden cut, meaning
  a 2.3cm margin on the inside of the document.\r\n\r\nHowever, I doubt that this
  mathematical calculation took the bit that goes missing in binding into consideration;
  did anyone bother to calculate the 'ideal' margins for a bound document? I do not
  have many footnotes or figures that would go in the margins.\r\n\r\nThe lenghth
  of the document is more or less not relevant, but I like it to look halfway decent.\r\n\r\nI'm
  writing the thesis in pages'08 (uncurl your toes, LaTeX users!) - hey, at least
  it does ligatures and employs the proper styles for small caps, and I yet have to
  discover any rivers.\r\n\r\nThe main text of the thesis is Adobe Garamond Premiere
  Pro, 12 pts with a headers and page nrs in the upper and lower corners, resp. "

    and, to a lesser extent, perfect binding all require more real estate than saddle-stitching

  body: "The problem with a A4 format is that a quite wide line measure is inevitable
    in a one column layout. A favored solution is to use wide margins. \r\nAnother
    way to use A4 favorably is by using a two column layout or a one-and-a-half column
    layout. The latter variety is very convenient for content with a high volume of
    notes (which can be placed in the half col).\r\n\r\nMy advice is to look at a
    stack of theses in your Uni's library and 'steal' the layout that you like most."

  body: "@ bert, I don't have many footnotes, I have mainly figures, but they are
    the full width of a page, not small ones that can go in the footnotes.\r\n\r\nThe
    A4 format is given by the local 'promotionsordnung', but that is it, as far as
    guidelines go. However, the external reviewer needs to be able to read it, and
    if the thing is set halfway decent it'll also read easier..."

  body: "Full width figures combined with a narrow text column will look very nice,
    eg in the case of an asymmetrical layout. I have used that for a lot of reports
    and such.\r\n\r\nA way to establish a column size: \r\n1. Typeset a typical piece
    of text in the size you envision (eg 10,5 pt on a 15 pt transport).\r\n2. Count
    the number of characters and the number of words for a sample of around 200 words.\r\n3.
    Establish the average of characters per word.\r\n4. Determine how many characters
    a measure of twelve or fourteen words is.\r\n5. That value is the ideal column
    width.\r\n\r\nNext: \r\n1. Typeset two pages of your text with this column width.
    I would use non-justified, but you might prefer justified setting.\r\n2. Print
    and use scissors to cut out the columns.\r\n3. Play with these on a folded sheet
    of A3-sized paper. Combine with boxes that symbolize your illustrations (use a
    maximum width of 18 cm). Try to make both pages (left and right) identical, eg
    with the same layout.\r\n4. At a certain point it will look 'right'. Paste everything
    down and measure margins etc.\r\n5. Use these for your final layout.\r\n\r\n"
