  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>All</p>
<p>I got some feedback on the initial drafts of this book design a while ago, but it is nearing completion now.</p>
<p>At the last minute I decided to get and try out a new typeface that I really love.  My first typeface is Arno Pro and the second is Feijoa.  I am not sure which works best in this context.</p>
<p>I would also welcome any other criticism on layout, leading, anything really. This is a piece of university coursework, which I have to submit as part of the degree.  I will, of course, include anything that I learn and use and reference my sources. I say this to be clear that I am trying to learn, rather than get something for free.  I have done a lot of reading and research, but as this is the first time I have designed a book, I would welcome opinions. For example I have used ligatures in the poem itself, but am not sure if they are too much here, especially opposite the calligraphy.</p>
<p>Both of my pdfs have a couple of blank pages at the beginning and they are not completely finished yet</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;If there is any general idea underlying Rumi&rsquo;s poetry, it is the absolute love of God. His influence&hellip;.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s influence or Rumi&rsquo;s influence?</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a native speaker&hellip;.&rdquo; This is a dangling modifier. The long phrase is not about &ldquo;Khalili&rsquo;s translations&rdquo;, it is about Khalili himself. Rewrite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rumi 24 years old&hellip;.&rdquo; Does this need another comma?</p>
<p>Is there some explanation of the calligraphy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;All rights reserved&hellip;.&rdquo; This entire paragraph is on the page twice. Is this intended? Also, at least in the US, the phrase used is not &ldquo;prior permission of the copyright holders&rdquo;, but rather &ldquo;prior permission of the publisher&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Do you need a year referenced in the copyright? (I have no idea.)</p>
<p>Well, I like the typeface in design 2; but this may be because I generally like darker fonts. And the dark face in design 2 goes with the calligraphy very well.  Design 2 is very readable. I vote for design 2.</p>
<p>This, to me, is a very readable left-aligned (ragged right) work. Very nice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Tim, that is really helpful.  I must admit I was concentrating so much on the layout and type that I have not paid much attention to the text!</p>
<p>I have made the corrections/amendments that you suggested, except that the coursework notes give the phrasing about the copyright, so will leave that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting process and design 2 is the third of my typeface choices.  I really like that typeface.
I would welcome any more feedback from others on the leading, titles or anything else really</p>
