  1910 as American Grinder and Manufacturing Company, changed its name to Blackhawk
  in 1925, bought Hydraulic Tool Company in 1927 and soon after began production of
  hydraulic tools for auto body and frame repair work.\r\n\r\nI'm working on restoring
  an art deco-ish styled steel case for a small Porto-Power set. The really bad looking
  one is what's on the case. I've re-created the Porto-Power lettering and the indian
  head from scratch.\r\n\r\nWhat I need are fonts as close as possible to the black
  lettering. I can add the tails or whatever on the tops of the A's by hand."

  body: "I think I've found a pretty good match for the small text at the bottom.
    Gotham Rounded... buuuut it ain't a freebie. Quite nice font, absolutely has the
    look of a font made with a lettering guide used in drafting.\r\n\r\nPoking around
    the web some more I found RockoELF http://www.fontspace.com/casady-and-greene/rockoflf
    I can stretch it sideways a bit to match the slightly squat shape on the logo.\r\n\r\nI
    think I should be able to find a font with the different stroke weights of the
    small Blackhawk text. I've seen many fonts like that, usually with 'deco' in the
    name.\r\n\r\nThe large Blackhawk text is what there seems to be nothing like.
    It has the weight and stroke widths and bulbous serifs of fonts like Cooper Black,
    *but* they're also concave serifs. It's like Cooper on a diet, practically anorexic.
    ;) If I end up having to construct it by hand I may just create a whole font based
    on it, at least the basic letters and digits."

    BrittanicEFBold I've attached a 25% size image of my recreated version. The original

    I can erase little divots to make the concave serifs.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Blackhawk-small_3955.jpg]"

  body: I'd try [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/magnesium/fonts/|Magnesium Regular]]
    for the small thick & thin Blackhawk rather than Brittanic, or at least tweak
    Britannic's slightly awkward curved-in C. Also the o and e on the original of
    Porto-Power don't have the flat tops you've given them in your version. They match
    the curve of the P better.

  body: The geek in me wants to do some optical corrections and nudge a few of those
    curves ever so slightly. And he wants to digitize the rest of the lettering as
    well. And his head hurts when he sees the kerning in the small print.

  body: "I gave up on trying to find anything close to the big Blackhawk lettering
    and knocked it together from scratch in a nonstop session.\r\n\r\nI have only
    been able to find three examples of this style of the logo, and they're all slightly
    different, especially the large Blackhawk letters.\r\n\r\nOne of them has big
    differences in the Indian head and its large Blackhawk lettering doesn't appear
    to have the concave serifs, but it's hard to tell due to the small image size,
    and overall it's much lighter, with the A feathers thinner and straighter.\r\n\r\nThe
    other example has almost the same Indian head as this one but the big Blackhawk
    lettering is somewhere in between.\r\n\r\nI'm calling it good enough for restoring
    the tool case. :)\r\n\r\nShould anyone want to muck about with this, just ask
    and I'll e-mail you the PSD files. While doing the big Blackhawk letters I also
    made an I and a V while making the H and W. The original letters were inconsistent
    a whole bunch with the serifs so I made one then copied and scaled it as needed.
    Since all the BLACK part was obscured except the tip of the lower leg of the K,
    I had to wing it on the B, L and C. They're based on those letters from the \"intermediate\"
    style but using the building blocks I made doing the HAWK part. KHAWK is placed
    exactly as in the original, I used a square shape as a one shot measuring stick
    to space the B from the left edge of the hexagon then nudged the LAC around until
    they looked good enough to me.\r\n\r\nIt's not absolutely perfect, but the hand
    drawn original wasn't perfect. I did adjust the centering of the small text and
    the hexagon was somewhat irregular, with the sides vertical the top and bottom
    points weren't right on center.\r\n\r\nI'd love to have a whole font of these
    characters, just because of those funky bulbous/concave serifs that're unlike
    anything I've ever seen on a font. I might get around to doing a TTF if I ever
    get un-busy enough from my classic car plastic parts reproduction business. I
    have done a TrueType font a few years ago, based on the KING COBRA 5.0 letters
    used on the 1978 Mustang King Cobra, even did lowercase.\r\n\r\nA font based on
    the Porto-Power letters would also be nifty, but inventing 25 more stylized caps
    that have the same look and feel as those P's? Ack! I'll leave that up to people
    who do things like create an entire font based on four letters, like the Nash
    script font used by the Nash Car Club for their magazine.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Blackhawk-25_6726.png]"

  body: On close inspection, I think the small, bold BLACKHAWK letters are actually
    Franklin Gothic (No. 2, in digital), somewhat spaced out. Brittanic is more of
    a WWI-era face. The smallest type is probably Venus.
