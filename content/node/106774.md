  body: 'Can''t find a match but actually, really doubting it''s a font as it. These
    /s and /e are also too close to Avant-Garde Gothic''s to be a coincidence (as
    you said in the title). The circle /o gives also more credit to the A-GG track.
    To me, that really looks like a custom job based on it. Actually, that''d even
    be quite easy: start with the Medium (or Bold) weight, remove /f crossbar left
    part and extend terminals, use a horizontally mirrored custom /f with a pulled
    upward crossbar for /t and recreate /p starting with /a adding a vertical stroke.
    Done :)'

  body: Looks like I was half wrong. This is a font (thanks fivos for finding it out)
    but to me, it looks like a swipe-n-hack job of Avant-Garde Gothic.
