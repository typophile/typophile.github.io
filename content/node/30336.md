body: "After downloading the OLPC emulation software for the XO 'One Laptop Per Child'
  OS. I noticed in the emulation the icons don't have labels. \r\n\r\nWhen I was at
  Microsoft the UI team and the industry as a whole believe that people read both
  the icon and the IMAGE of the labels. Meaning they don't necessarily read the labels
  words but the words are helpful to the recall of the icon's task. \r\n\r\nI could
  prove that theory by knowing I have used Polish Windows and other languages that
  I do not know a single word from and found the icons were clear when you had been
  using one language consistently, but when changed or removed the labels they were
  not obvious. \r\n\r\nOther things I found obvious (in the emulation) was that the
  browser will have problems because it may not have plug-ins installed. This could
  be corrected but the computer and it's software are Open Source and the plug-ins
  are commercial software (ie. companies that want to get paid for their work). And
  there is no real system font even though I suspect there will be a few for writing
  or chats.. Hmmm what will those be? \r\n\r\nSo will this be one poor laptop for
  one poor child? I'm sure they could do better by showing people how to rebuild all
  those millions of computer cases into current barebones like computers. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/littlesugar_4969.jpg]"

    there are fonts in the dialogs. Some icons have popups so it will have words and
    fonts. But shareware I guess.\r\n"

  body: "Going from having no technology to having a laptop, albeit sans icon labels,
    doesn't seem to be a huge issue in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nAs for Windows,
    my desktop can't even show a label beyond 10 characters or so without cutting
    if off, making it fairly useless. OSX and the Windows quick launch bar don't use
    labels either, so it doesn't seem to be too radical of an idea."

  body: I get 12 characters on icons in WinXP but QuickLaunch probably assumes you
    know what 'Quick' launches since you add or delete them. Like AOL,MSN,wireless
    connection but of course there are pop-up names in my WinXP.
