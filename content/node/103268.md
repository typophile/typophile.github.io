body: "A while ago I researched out of curiosity if it was possible to build fonts
  with embedded colour bitmaps like the Apple Color Emoji font on Mac OS 10.7/10.8.
  I figured out the \xABsbix\xBB table format and wrote some code that can be hooked
  into the Python FontTools to decompile and compile the sbix table which contains
  the image data.\r\n\r\nSome of my research was generously allowed to happen during
  my working hours at FontShop International.\r\n\r\nAfter pondering for a while what
  to do with this knowledge, me and FontShop International finally decided to make
  the code public to encourage experimentation.\r\n\r\nSo without further ado, please
  check out the attached demo scripts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.kutilek.de/download/sbix_code.zip\">sbix_code.zip</a>
  | <a href=\"http://www.kutilek.de/download/sbix_demo.zip\">sbix_demo.zip</a>\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nAdd
  the three files in <a href=\"http://www.kutilek.de/download/sbix_code.zip\">sbix_code.zip</a>
  to the directory <code>ttLib/tables</code> of your existing <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/\">FontTools</a>
  installation. You can probably find it in <code>/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/fontTools/</code>.\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n\r\nCheck
  out the demo scripts in <a href=\"http://www.kutilek.de/download/sbix_demo.zip\">sbix_demo.zip</a>
  for examples of how to build your own colour bitmap font or extract the images from
  an existing font. If you want a proof of concept, view the included <code>ColorTestSbix.ttf</code>
  on Mac OS X. It should look like in the included font book screenshot. The name
  ColorTest is a bit misleading as it\u2019s only a scanned typewriter face in greyscale
  ;)\r\n\r\nIf you just run <code>addSbixImages.py</code>, it will add the pngs from
  <code>set_150</code> to the file <code>ColorTest.ttf</code> and save the resulting
  font as <code>ColorTestSbix.ttf</code>.\r\n\r\nIf you have the original Apple Color
  Emoji font, you can use <code>extractSbixImages.py</code> to extract the pngs from
  it. They will be saved in the <code>extracted</code> directory.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n<img

    this a shot. But is it limited to running on OSX?\r\n\r\nBTW is the \"reverse-engineering\"
    of the sbix table something Apple could complain about?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, the Python scripts are not limited to OS X. But Windows doesn\u2019t
    come with any Python preinstalled, so you have to install it first (and then the
    Python FontTools) if you don\u2019t have it. (Of course the generated fonts will
    not show any bitmaps on Windows.)\r\n\r\nRegarding the reverse-engineering, I\u2019m
    not the first one who has figured out the sbix format, or built a proof-of-concept
    font (Theunis de Jong did so in http://typophile.com/node/96671#comment-524462),
    so my maybe naive view is that if Apple wasn\u2019t OK with it, they would have
    complained already ;)"

  body: Somebody reported a bug in <code>_s_b_i_x.py</code> that would affect fonts
    with more than one bitmap size. The offset of the 2nd and all following sets was
    off by 8 bytes. I have corrected the bug and uploaded the new file to the link
    above.

  body: "Hi,\r\nThat's a nice experimentation.\r\nI was playing around with it and
    it seems I encounter a problem now that I am on Mavericks.\r\nThe script doesn't
    find the font and say\r\n <code> IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
    'ColorTest.ttf' </code> \r\nLast time I look at it, I was on Mountain Lion and
    didn't face this problem.\r\nDid you know in Maverick what is causing the script
    or python to fail to see the font file ?\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nadr"
