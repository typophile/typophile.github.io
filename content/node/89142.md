  Apparatus and we've just launched a Kickstarter campaign that I thought (hope) most
  some of you may find interest in. We are attempting to reconstruct a beveled typeface
  that we created for a side project into a working overlapping digital font.\r\n\r\nHere's
  the typographic-money-pleading below:\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2049768676/valuco-font-design\r\n\r\nAnd

  body: "It\u2019s easy to be skeptical about Kickstarter if one just looks at the
    merits of a typeface proposal, vis-a-vis what is already available.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    Kickstarter is a way for customers to become involved with a type designer's studio/foundry,
    especially through custom and short-run specimens, and even in some cases with
    sponsor-initiated design features.\r\n\r\nHow a Kickstarter typeface proposal
    fares likely has a lot to do with how well the proposal is presented, and how
    effectively the various sponsor benefits are configured."

  body: "\r\nOh, yeah. We're aware of Detroit as well as M&K's equally accomplished
    Prismatic. What I  hope makes this face original in it's own right is that we
    are coming at it from the perspective of printmakers (screenprinters, speficically.)
    So by including actual hatching into the face we are attempting to pull off just
    as successful a bevel in this face with two colors whereas others require three
    or more. We have most DEFINITELY come at typography from a weird direction, beginning
    with screenprinted artwork and then attempting a font design from that. But I
    like to think that (in addition to Nick's assessment of Kickstarter) the site
    is also somewhat of an incubator for attempts at new ideas and uncharted territory,
    which is definitely what we are up to here.\r\n"

    exploring the concept and technique of crosshatching in a PostScript typeface.\r\n\r\nAre

    a standard em square, although I am wondering if I need to expand that or attempt
    to reduce the quantity of hatching within our shadow. The letterform is admittedly
    \"ultra-display\" and only really effective after 72 pt.\r\n\r\nIn process\u2026"
