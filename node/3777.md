body: 'okay i&#39;m sorry for slaughtering the portuguese language. but my little
  sister is getting married and wants to send announcements to friends in Brasil.
  I&#39;m hoping that there might be some portuguese gurus to help me out on this
  one. The english announcement &#40;bottom&#41; is a done deal &#40;mistakes and
  all&#41; and the portuguese one &#40;top&#41; is more of an afterthought just to
  let friends know that the marriage will/has transpire/d. whovever translated the
  text &#40;it wasn&#39;t i&#41; took out the names for Shrs &amp; Shras Hunt &amp;
  Rosser that appear in the English version. Is this customary? Also is the typing
  out of the year &#40;2004&#41; cusotmary as opposed to spelling it out? I would
  appreciate any help with this one that anyone can offer. Any other comments of the
  overal design are welcome. Thnx in advance<!--attachment: InvitePort-29190.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*679.2*invitation*InvitePort%2epdf

    the linespacing seems too loose in the main body. I would tighten that up to visually
    match the bottom two blurbs of type. This will also give you &#40;a&#41; more
    white space and &#40;b&#41; more space with which you can even the space from
    the future bride&#39;s name to the future groom&#39;s. The words &#34;ao prezado&#34;
    may be mathematically accurate, but visually it seems not to have enough space
    below it.

    to fix the spacing, tiff, did i succeed? i agree with you on the ao prezado. it
    seems off center because the line above has no decenders, so i gave it a nudge
    upward. hopefully my sister still likes the design after all my tweaking on it.
    and i guess i&#39;ll have to design a pineapple worthy of accolades since this
    one seems to have been a flop. ;^&#41; &#40;i didn&#39;t think anyone used the
    smiley with the pointy nose besides me either, tiff&#41; someday i&#39;ll make
    a font called pineapple pi... send me yer pineapple ornaments!
