  body: Alex,  <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t you get it? What you want to do is unethical and
    illegal, and I don&#39;t think anyone here is going to help you steal the intellectual
    property of designers or foundries. If you ever get a design job, and see your
    work stolen by someone else, maybe you will understand the point here.

  body: Can someone point Alex to a free font site where he might be able to get enough
    characters to present his idea to his teacher. Knock offs abound but aren&#39;t
    commerical quality. He doesn&#39;t need a commercial font. Would DaFont be a good
    source?  <BR> <BR>Mike and others you&#39;ve done a good job of education about
    intellectual property.

  body: Alex, I know you&#39;re a student and all but it&#39;s only $25! That&#39;s
    the price of a pack of cigarettes, a latte, a movie ticket and a beer. If   you
    need this particular font that badly, pay up. Otherwise there are plenty of free
    fonts that look like this. DaFont is a good start. But I&#39;m not gonna do your
    research for you.
