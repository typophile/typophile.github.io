  she is giving today. It is not very funny, but she thinks it is, and to add insult
  to injury, the entire thing is set in Comic Sans. I had to bite my lip, as the proliferation
  of Comic Sans in our company emails has become a running joke among a few of my
  peers here at the plant, and this is the icing on the cake.\r\n\r\nIs it my responsibity
  to enlighten my supervisor? I consider it an embarrassment to the art department
  as a whole, but I am not the art director, so should I just let it go and shake
  me poor head in despair?\r\n\r\nWhat would Tschichold do?\r\n"

    if you're in a larger market, where you could consider finding a different employer...but

    better, open up a better typeface, change the name to 'comic sans', resave it

    You only paid for what you carried out. \r\n\r\nWell, you wouldn't have wanted

    you're referring to, I am in full agreement. Not too great. Had noting to do with
    it. The refrigerated milk comes in boxes that are never meant to be displayed,
    as the milk normally goes from the box to the retail cooler. I hope you will agree
    that our half gallon is the most classic of the bunch. I think it is.\r\n\r\nNow
