  it. I can't  remember the last time I walked into a music store and bought a CD.
  I almost bought the last Snow Patrol album off a shelf but I decided I'd save a
  few bucks and get it digitally instead. I'd forgotten how much I like album art
  until this new iTunes version.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/itunes_visualizer_3942.png]\r\n\r\n"

    accross a room and were invited to give it a spin at 33 1/3 rpm.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Byrne</a> had just written an interesting piece about the slow demise of cover
    art a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\nThe Web 2.0 glossy floor reflections are silly and
    distracting, though. And in the case of the Grouped view, they often render the
    album title unreadable!\r\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the new UI elements,
    seemingly foreign to the Mac OS."
