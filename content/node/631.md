    best. There might be something nice in the orphaned &#34;e&#34; too.

  body: what i find intersting in the first logo <BR>is the space that &#34;s&#34;
    lets between &#34;pa&#34;  <BR>and &#34;te&#34;. The impression that the  line
    of &#34;s&#34; <BR>pastes together the two separated parts would  <BR>work nice,
    giving typographicaly the meaning  <BR>of the written word. <BR> <BR>Propably
    this idea would work better with clear <BR>forms as you try bellow, though the
    world is full <BR>of clean cuts and pure linear forms. A bit of  <BR>&#34;strangness&#34;
    &#40;the long &#34;s&#34;&#41; would make  <BR>the difference.

  body: you could approach this one of two ways. <BR> <BR>1&#41; clean up the original
    sketch with a vector outline <BR> <BR>2&#41; give the single path version some
    stroke modulation  <BR>&#40;and round the endings too&#41; <BR> <BR>in either
    case, try to make the &#39;a&#39; and &#39;s&#39; a bit more  <BR>identifiable.
    I think the key to your design is to  <BR>preserve the hand-drawn look, as if
    it was skillfully, but  <BR>whimsically, drawn with a sharpie.

    is better, and the &#34;s&#34; is elongated and more identifiable. I have wasted
    a couple of hours trying to do some stroke modulation in illustrator, and as much
    as I&#39;m all about vector, I think my next step is going to be printing this
    out in a nice big size so I can play with it by hand. I want to add little endcaps/swirls
    so that it looks more hand/marker drawn.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13128.gif"

    think the s doesnt look like its there at all. It could look, to some people,
    like a line connecting the &#34;a&#34; to the &#34;t&#34;. maybe if you disconnent
    the &#34;s&#34; from the continues line of the a-s-t, and make the &#34;s&#34;
    start from somewhere alittle above the baseline it would make the &#34;s&#34;
    and the &#34;a&#34; clearer. <BR>and i think this is much better the the initial
    sketch. just my personal feeling about it.

  body: I really like the character of this one... more informal. Kind of reminds
    me of the <a href="http://www.veer.com/"> Veer</a> logo. <BR> <BR>The e looks
    sloppy to me for some reason... I think it might have to do with the stroke not
    being consistent with the a and p. Might want to see what it looks like if you
    think the stroke out on top a bit. <BR> <BR>Try putting a spur &#40;not the right
    term again... I know&#41; on the a... it&#39;d definitely make it more legible,
    but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll kill the monoline quality of this. I think even
    a really subtle spur &#40;like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/pendry-script/d/testdrive.html?s=a&amp;p=96">
    this</a> would help things out here. Seems to me like it&#39;s really hard to
    pull off a completely curved script a.

    the &#39;cut&#39;n&#39;paste&#39; aesthetic through the design of other identity

    I&#39;ve tweaked all the letters and adjusted the &#34;tracking&#34;... I&#39;m
    worried it&#39;s getting too thin, but it seems to gain perceived weight in print,
    and I guess I can always add a black stroke to it. <BR> <BR>Does the &#34;p&#34;

    alt=""> <BR> <BR>1. You&#39;ve got a nice thing going with the thick-to-thin transitions
    in the p, a, and s. The t-to-e connection still seems a bit fat, and the tail
    of the e also seems slightly less fluid than the other rest of the letterforms
    <BR> <BR>2. There&#39;s a little &#34;bump&#34; or &#34;kink&#34; near the top
    of the bowl of the e that is a tad distracting. <BR> <BR>Otherwise I think this
    is a great solution - well-crafted enough to be taken seriously, while retaining
    much of the playfullness of your original sketch.'
