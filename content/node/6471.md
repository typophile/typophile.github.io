  body: I don&#39;t respond to this command. Normally I&#39;m very aware that the
    client has to be happy AND the design has to work. But I won&#39;t stretch type,
    and I do complain when asked. <BR> <BR>In this case though, it&#39;s not like
    you will be messing up a corporate identity or something major. <BR> <BR>This
    is why I keep Helvetica around with its condensed, compressed and other unholy
    incarnations. If the client really could care less, at least I can fit whatever
    they throw at me without doing damage to the type.

  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s either proper or smart to just refuse to do it
    - but if you offer an alternative &#40;after explaining the necessity&#41;, like
    suggesting to redraw the type to fit the measure without distortion, then that&#39;s
    great. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: When one of my clients has asked it only happens once. Even my boss knows
    to ask for some more condensed verus squooshing what is used. <BR> <BR>When a
    client does ask I do not complain, but I do tease them a little and then I show
    them, educate them, to what the difference is in squooshing what we are using
    or finding a condensed version that will work &#40;or another option altogether&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I am happy that I have such good relationships with my clients that they
    want to learn and understand. I like to think that they want what is best, and
    they see that I do feel this way which makes them in turn want what is best.

  body: Unfortunately, all clients are not considerate or sophisticated enough to
    understand what they are paying you to do. <BR> <BR>I hyperbolize a bit about
    complaining, but then some people only understand compliance or noncompliance.
    <BR> <BR>I think Tiffany is fortunate to work at a level and position where collaboration
    and respect trump submission and dominance. <BR> <BR>I will say that it is so
    rare that I take a strong stance, that when I do it is noticed.  Which battles
    to pick now? <BR> <BR>Clearly I feel empathic about Richard&#39;s position. From
    a larger perspective, I also find a strong correlation between the success of
    a project and the degree to which a client is confident enough to let me do my
    job.

  body: James, trust me, I&#39;m a glorified production artist, that is all. I was
    simply trying to point out that if one takes the stance of an educator -- someone
    who shares the reasons why -- then that persons clients will come to expect their
    designer to choose the best and want to show them why as well.

  body: Yes, and if you use it without a proper license I&#39;ll sue you. And if you
    use the word in something you try to trademark I&#39;ll sue you. <BR> <BR>Hehe.
    Just kidding. Guess I shouldn&#39;t joke like that. It is bound to get me into
    trouble.

  body: One way around the thorny client issue is to remind them that in the future
    if you need to make a change to a file, or someone else has to make a change,
    there might not be any way of telling how much the type was squooshed. So for
    safety sake, just use a normal condensed face.

  body: I shall certainly use a compressed or condensed Helvetica to do this. It was
    just about the limit first thing this morning. <BR> <BR>The particular irony is
    that these reflective badges are intended to be fixed to high visibility personal
    protection garments. High visibility, but just about zero legibility. <BR> <BR>The
    lower badge is actually quite a good example of the apalling effect that squooshing

    know it&#39;s crap...  <BR>Why would they even notice that you&#39;ve fixed it
    for them. There&#39;s  <BR>not even a need for discussion. Just use Helvetica

    to be centred! <BR> <BR>Our contract is to supply only, so I don&#39;t know about
    sewing them directly on to the puppies David, but we can offer a heat applied
    alternative if you think that might be kinder.
