  I'm sure all of the people filled with knowledge about fonts and what not know exactly
  where I can find one. Thanks! \r\n-Anthony"

    Blair</a>. But, your sample looks squooshed.

  body: Is there any equivalents? I don't feel like paying 30 dollars for a steenkin'
    font. LOL

  body: You are talking to people who make steenkin' fonts for a living. $30 is very
    reasonable.

  body: I'm very appreciative for the work people put into it. But I only do my projects
    as something fun. Its an alternative to spending money for my Model Railroad.
    That's why I do virtual railroading. I try not to spend money for stuff like this.

  body: Sorting through DaFont, I see [[http://www.dafont.com/media-gothic.font?text=ALASKA|Media
    Gothic]], which is sort of (but not really) similar. But if you aren't willing
    to pay, then you can't afford to be picky. This forum is the largest concentration
    of type knowledge you'll ever see, but this is not the place to ask, "I want a
    font as close as possible to this one, but I don't want to pay for it," because
    most of us view "knockoff" fonts with a certain level of disdain.

  body: I suppose you are right. I'm already backed up with proper money. My life
    seems to be very unlucky, my phone broke, 400 dollar camcorder broke. I just do
    not have the money for a font or anything else I "want".

    afford one, y'know. :-)
