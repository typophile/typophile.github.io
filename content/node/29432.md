  body: "Hi Nicholas. Thanks for your concern, but we're not sure if these are isolated
    incidents or if this is a systematic security breach. Two spammers in two days
    is indeed worrying. While the powers that be (Supa Christian and J'nJ) try to
    figure out what's what, just sit tight and ignore the silly spamming bastids.\r\n\r\nHow
    to get rid of them is pretty simple -- delete the account and all the related
    comments disappear. Unfortunately I don't have that level of administrator access
    and I don't feel like deleting all the separate posts one by one, so please be
    patient till the American West Coast wakes up."

    but mildly concerned would be a better description ;) I'm sure you all know what
    you're doing, keep up the good work,\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: Well, I definitely share your feelings and am concerned as well by this breach
    of security, so no worries. Christian and I had a brief discussion when the last
    spammer hit us a way back. He said that our registration system was secure enough,
    and if proven wrong he'd deal with it in due time, which makes sense to me.

    2 weeks. It's tough to keep up but it's got to be done. Maybe the spammers think
    the holiday season is there best time to strike - just like department stores.\r\n\r\nBest
