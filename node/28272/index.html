  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Folks,

I'm new to the board (and the typography world, in general) and was hoping someone could help in my search for knowledge.

I'm in the process of putting together a presentation on [[Friedrich Poppl]] for a university class I'm enrolled in.  To give my presentation life, I would like to share examples of Poppl's work in a real-world setting.  

I'm especially intrigued by the notion that Poppl's Saladin font inspired an entire generation of neo-gothic fonts.

So..   

1.  Does anyone know where I can find a movie poster site with examples of posters utlizing Poppl's "Saladin" font?  Any names of movies would also be appreciated.  I've surfed through plenty of poster sites tonight without any luck.  My eyes are tired.

2.  Does anyone know of any solid Saladin inspired fonts out there?  In other words, do you know of any fonts that are a direct off-shot of Saladin and where they were used?

Thanks in advance for any help you folks can offer.  It's been an interesting project so far.  I hope someone out there can help add some meat to my research.

Wayne

I don't have any knowledge of the original and can't point you to any uses but a google threw this up.

What a second... here it is... the font is advertised as "Poppl's neo-gothic classic."

Thoughts anyone?

		<div class="commentbody">I know it's described as neo-gothic now, but I doubt Poppl would have subscribed to that (does anyone know if it was ever called gothic before the Canadatype version?). Gothic is probably a less nebulous notion in Germany than it might be elsewhere, and the original name of the font clearly points in another direction. Not everything spiky is gothic, even in architecture, especially when the spikes are on one side. JMO, but it might help Wayne decide which way to look for Saladin "offshoots" (not that I know any myself).</div>
