  drapery consultant/designer). One of my options is using Emigre's Dalliance. Could
  someone recommend a companion typeface to contrast Dalliance on business cards and
  stationery. Using Dalliance itself, throughout, is a little much. \r\n\r\nAny and
  all suggestions are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAndrew"
