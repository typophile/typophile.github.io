body: I would like to know the font that is used in the French highway signage system,
  the general belief is it is a Frutiger, but can somebody confirm this? Thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/D43.gif]

  body: if Sweden can afford to have their own typeface especially made for their
    signage, i'm sure France would too.. so my guess is that it's not a widely available
    typeface.

  body: For something similar you could look at HTF Gotham Condensed, Erbar, or Interstate
    Condensed (based on US highway signage)
