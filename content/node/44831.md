    present only in the \u2018Text Egyptian\u2019 flayour) was what confused me.\r\n\r\n<cite>We
    added some wedge-shaped ball terminals on characters like 'a' and 'f' to even
    out the color</cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.christianschwartz.com/gdntegyp.shtml\">Christian

  body: "I just love the Guardian Egyptian typeface family and rather cheekily cut
    up the guardian logo to make the word damieng using the r and the n very crudely
    to make an m.\r\n\r\nI was expecting somebody to complain given that it wasn't
    yet available for licensing but you guys are the first to notice ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyone
    trying to go see it won't find it at the moment - the site is down because of
    an explosion/fire at the ISP hosting company :(\r\n\r\n[)amien"
