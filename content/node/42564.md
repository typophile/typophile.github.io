  body: I've tried it with the example file that came with the AFDKO stuff and that
    one seems to work fine.  I'll adapt that file to suit my needs. Still can't figure
    out what I did wrong with the file I made myself though...

  body: "It sounds like a problem with the linebreaks in your file. Make sure you
    use a a plain text editor (like the free TextWrangler for instance; Apple's TextEdit
    is not so suitable). Make sure you use Unix linebreaks and finish the last entry
    in your file with a linebreak too.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."
