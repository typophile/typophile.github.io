  body: Our local Target used it in the food section at one point. It's since been
    replaced with Avenir. The forms are a little quirky (the straight quotes bother
    me a little), but I've enjoyed using it on a couple of projects.

  body: I have always liked this face, and have almost purchased it a few times. But
    there is, as Addison pointed out, some quirkiness to it. It seems a little inconsistent
    between weights, so I have not used it. I think I like that black, headline weight
    the best.

  body: 'I''m contemplating if I could use the regular/medium weight for a magazine
    logotype. However, I know that the magazine Nordic Reach uses this typeface already...
    I love the ligatures... Do you know any other typeface that has the nice arch
    for ligatures? '

  body: "Hello guys, what do you feel is quirky about Malm\xF6 Sans?\r\n\r\nSince
    we (fountain) are slowly starting to update the library to OT and fixing up the
    fonts, it would be good to get any suggestions and pointers. Addison mentioned
    the straight quotes, so I'll write that down.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote (even tough
    I'm more than a bit bias) \u2013 I love working wth Malm\xF6 Sans on design jobs.
    Especially the Small Caps.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'One of the things I dislike is the difference in stroke width (modulation?)
    in the bold weight versus the regular weight. The regular weight has very little.
    And the bold weight seems to have too much. It almost doesn''t look like the same
    typeface to me. I love the headline weight, and the unicase characters. I love
    the character of the typeface though. It has a very friendly feel, while still
    being very constructed. PS: Peter, I hope when the site is updated you''ll be
    releasing "South" that is one nice looking typeface.'

    to be within the next weeks, but i hope to have it fixed and ready befor ethe
    end of this year. Running a foundry on your own promoting other designers typefaces
    as well unfortunately leaves less and less time for your own designs.\r\n\r\nYou're
    correct \u2013 it is the the same. I propably wouldn't have done it that way (I'm
    too boring), but I try not to interfere too much with the designers ideas and
    designs. One thing I like about Martin and his approach to type is that is so
    unbiased \u2013 he draws as he see's it, without  any presumtions of how type
    \"should be done\" but still with a lot of love. I think that is what makes them
    (his typefaces) stand out. It's the same feeling I get from looking at a typeface
    from the Nebiolo foundry. It's different but somehow it fits.\r\n\r\ntsongtze

    bought their licenses from Fountain the last 2 years will be able to upgrade for
    a very small price.  Hopefully most fonts will be OT within a few months, but
    I really can't say when. \r\n\r\nHere's a design were I used  Malm\xF6 Sans:\r\n<a
