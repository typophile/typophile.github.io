  Kyoto. Do you know of anyone? Do you know of any great examples of typefaces produced
  in Japan (that are Latin/Roman etc not Kanji/Hiragana etc.)\r\n\r\nI'm also currently
  investigating whether stacked/vertical type would be a suitable alternative to regular
  horizontal type. Can anyone recommend any interesting monospace/unicode faces that
  would make for a pleasing vertical stack?\r\n\r\nAny help or opinions on Japanese

    he currently lives in Germany (working for Linotype) and I don't know if he ever
    lived in Kyoto. Among the newest generation of Japanese type designers is Kunihiko
    Okano, author of Quintet:\r\nhttp://www.photolettering.com/plog/2011/dec/23/new-alphabet-quintet-kunihiko-okano/\r\n\r\nAnd

  body: "Akira's home country is Niigata, not Kyoto. On the other hand, Kunihiko was
    actually born and raised in Kyoto. You should get in touch with him (just google
    his name to get a contact). He is very active in Japan and has done many jobs
    with Type Project (famous for Axis typeface) and Jiyu Kobo (Hiragino). Also Kunihiko
    was the gold prize winner of the Morisawa type competition in the Japanese category.\r\n\r\nUpright
    vertical Latin (particularly the lowercase) typesetting is ugly to begin with,
    but here's my thought. A good vertical Latin can only be found in Japan, but even
    then it is kinda difficult to find. What makes a good vertical Latin type is the
    presence of vertical metrics which you can only find in Japanese fonts. Also the
    short ascender and descender helps a lot (you'll see why when you set the word
    \"typography\" vertically; the ph creates a huge, unpleasing counter shape). I
    think one of the following fonts are good in that sense, although I cannot confirm
    it now: Axis, Hiragino, Kozuka, Meiryo.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm another Japanese
    designer. A Reading graduate and type designer at Monotype UK (but haven't released
    any retail font yet), but since I wasn't born in Kyoto and don't work in Japan,
    perhaps I don't count."

    someone explain what makes Adobe's <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2010/01/kazuraki_available.html\">Kazuraki</a>
    so 'groundbreaking'? Is it the proportional spacing?"

  body: "Hi Ben, you can do it in FontLab and even preview it (shamefully I do not
    remember how to do it, but I remember that it's pretty easy).\r\n\r\nAnd by 'someone'
    perhaps you mean me, right? The innovations in Kazuraki is that this is the genuinely
    proportional Japanese font made for the first time, whose engineering is actually
    much less straightforward than you think. The implementation of vertical ligatures
    was also something that nobody had done on a commercial level. Just read the first
    half of this (or at least the first page) if you want more detail:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/5901.Kazuraki_Tutorial.pdf\r\n\r\nHrant,
    thanks for your kind comments. Quadraat Headliner seems to create a very thin
    line when typeset vertically (I assume we're talking about upright vertical as
    opposed to rotated). As for horizontal proportion, I think the character needs
    to be relatively uniform in width so that one-stem characters (I, i, l) do not
    thin down the line too much. Japanese newspapers use vertically-condensed typefaces
    and set vertically, just like the western papers use horizontally-condensed ones,
    but whether a vertical Latin text in the former proportion looks good or not,
    I do not know (maybe interesting to try setting Univers Expanded vertically)."

    Not that I'm about to start designing Japanese! What I'm wondering is would there
    be any circumstances under which it would be useful to include vertical spacing
    for Latin in a non-CJK font? "

  body: "If I work on a typeface with a Japanese typesetting in mind, I would definitely
    do it. It doesn't harm to have a vertical metrics, and for most letters it can
    be automated; just apply the same metrics to the letters on the same height line.
    Also it's very important to align all characters at the central axis. Better yet,
    make vertical alternate (valt) letters for J and Q!\r\n\r\nShame that non-Japanese
    version of InDesign doesn't do vertical setting while Illustrator and even Photoshop
    can do it."

    going to solve the problem.
