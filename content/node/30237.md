  with that \"O\" but not sure if it's going to work.  I may just make this an all
  caps typeface with alternate caps for lowercase.   - first thoughts? Thanks\r\n\r\n*I
  added a second picture after I \"funkified\" it.  Familiar to some House fonts maybe,
  but pretty fun, like?*"

  body: 563 is much better, more usable. It's a festive little thing and could win
    a few fans as an all caps with alts.

  body: I think I'm pretty close on the uppercase, have a look- It sort of lost its
    funkiness in favor of a more deco feel [img:sites/default/files/old-images/fartdeco_4743.png]

  body: "Nice. You can have two styles, Deco and Funky.\r\n\r\nI think your Q might
    have a little too much weight at the bottom of the curve. 'U' too light all around,
    and maybe too narrow. 'S' is overshooting too much for this Deco version. 'H'
    crossbar may be too low too, as much as I like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/tags/lowwaist\">low-waisted
    letters</a>."

  body: I like Stephen's comment about having "Funky" and "Deco" -- obviously, this
    image has them in that order....  ;-)

    typefaces.. thanks guys

  body: Much better without the dotted "o". I am a fan of that character, however,
    it just didn't fit with the rest of the set. Good lookin' font.
