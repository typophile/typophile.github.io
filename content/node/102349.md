  in Illustrator, and export them to Type Tool 3. Firstly, I'm unsure what the document
  size in Illustrator should be. I've read little on exporting from Illustrator, beyond
  saving as EPS. Any basic tips would be greatly appreciated."

    somewhere to go, other than just google, here is the link to Adam Twardoch's guide
    to moving from one to the other:\r\n\r\nhttp://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=7596.0\r\n\r\nAssuming
    this is not just a one off, the sooner you move to working natively in the font
    editor, the happier (really) you will be."

  body: "Max, I also started designing glyphs in Illustrator and received the same
    recommendation \u2013to design directly in the font editor. You can see [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|here]]
    what David said to me.\r\n\r\nI had some resistence to follow this path as I already
    knew AI. But after a weekend with a font editor (in my case, FontLab) I became
    familiar with it and soon realized this was the <em>best</em> thing to do. So
    I can just repeat what others already said."
