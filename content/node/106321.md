body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe have a font generated from FontLab as OTF that is being used
  in Word 2010. The EM dash in the font isn\u2019t displaying correctly on the screen,
  though it does PDF correctly.\r\n\r\nIt almost appears as if Word is building the
  display of the EM dash from a bunch of kerned together dashes. This is causing some
  very problematic display and alignment issues, especially since the zoom at which
  the page is being displayed effects how it looks as does the justification of the
  line.\r\n\r\nThis does NOT occur when the font is generated as a TTF.\r\n\r\nThe
  below screen shot is an extrme zoom not usually used but the same thing happens
  at smaller zooms.\r\n\r\nThe font was initially a series of Type1 fonts so the UPM
  is 1000.\r\n\r\nIs this just an inadaquacy of Word being able to display the OTF?\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nKen\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EM_dash_3863.jpg]"
