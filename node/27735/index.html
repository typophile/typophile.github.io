  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Beloved brothers and sisters in type:
While reading through a copy of the old trade journal <em>The Inland Printer</em>, I stumbled across the following column. I found it inspiring and wished to share it with all of you. Long? By internet standards, yes. But worth a read for so many reasons.
AHL</p>
<p><strong>Have We Reached the End?</strong>
The development of the art of printing has been so great, the improvements so rapid, and the inventions pertaining to it so numerous, that those who can remember the old hand-lever, tympan, frisket, one-token-an-hour press have often forced upon them the conviction that the limit has been reached, and that it is a flight of the imagination to suppose of anything beyond. The doubter says “aye.” He stands upon the borders of a veritable wonder-land, and, looking within, fancies he sees, “Thus far shalt thou go and no farther,” inscribed upon the desire and ambition of the craft. And he has much to sustain him in his belief. Especially within the last decade, the growth and possibilities of printing have been phenomenal, more so probably than can be claimed for any of the arts whose purpose is the elevation, the enlightenment, the progress of humanity in the broadest and best interpretation.</p>
<p>To trace the onward progress from the slow, crude and tedious labors of even a quarter of a century ago would be a task of almost insurmountalbe difficulties; nor yet is it necessary. We have the practical results, and they are sufficient. We touch a tiny lever with our finger tips, and blanket sheets fly from the press more swiftly than human tongue can count. The same machinery that prints, cuts, pastes and folds, with unerring precision, counts sheets as well.  Human hands are out of competition in the race, and human muscles would fail before it had hardly begun. So perfect, intricate, and apparently self-assured has machinery become that it may almost be said to be endowed with the principles of immortality.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that the skeptic hesitates to believe in a beyond. Every feature presented seems the embodiment of perfection. He contrasts the old “Albion” or “Washington” of his apprentice days with the “lightning changes” of the press of 1886, and is perplexed. He well remembers the time when, as an ambitious aspirant for fame, he managed to set, correct and distribute his eight thousand ems in ten hours, and stands amazed at the latest record of the champions. He counts upon his thumbs the thousands of impressions produced by a press during working hours in the past, while he cannot upon the fingers of both hands the number of thousands worked off in the twentieth portion of that time in the present. He staggers in the attempt to lift the immense rolls of paper now used, and thinks humorously of the old-fashioned 24 by 38 that came to him in two-ream bundles, and was fed by single sheets. He reflects upon the roller-boy, sees how entirely he is shelved, and how much better his work is done by brass, iron and steel. He whistles dubiously at the banishment of soft blankets, and is loath to admit that better work can be done with hard packing. He looks in vain for the wetting trough, and smiles when told that paper is now used dry. In place of the wooden quoins, shooting-stick and mallet he finds only metal contrivances that have to locked with a nondescript key. In the “electro” department he finds simplicity has taken the place of mystery, and greyhound swiftness the slow, cumbersome movements of the tortoise.</p>
<p>Nor is this all. He cannot comprehend the cleanliness, the cog-wheel system of today. The dingy, creaking alley stairs no longer lead to a spidered rookery, yclept a printing office. The change from a “sky parlor” to one lower, well lighted and ventilated has been as perfect as it is pleasant. Health and comfort have been considered in all the arrangements. The floor is no longer a wilderness of ink-begrimed paper, or tobacco juice, and even the hellbox occupies a more dignified position than its old-boot namesake, formerly nailed to the corner of a dilapidated case. The glimmer of the tallow-dip has been superseded by the full blaze of electricity, an agency which will yet doubtless play an important part in the future development of printing.</p>
<p>Practically, there has been no limit to its progress. Discovery has not only kept pace with, but outstripped both needs and desires. So it has been in every branch. The boiling metal has been molded into forms of beauty and utility; in fact, so much has printing trespassed upon the bounds of what was once called “art” that even the graver finds in it a formidable rival. Rule, that but a few years ago was as unbending as a “country squire,” now willingly yields to every curve of symmetry and beauty, shaped by the magic touch of the skilled compositor.</p>
<p>And well, also, has the paper-maker done his part. The gloss, the smoothness, the tints, the toughness are all that can reasonably be desired. New fiber has been found and utilized, not alone to satisfy a craze for something new, but for the most realistic of uses—cheapness—a great desideratum, if coupled with merit, for the printer.</p>
<p>In a thousand and one of the littles that go to make up the grand total of success, the good work has been steadily going on. No one article can be named that has not been touched with the magic wand of improvement. Little, if any, that is crude remains to baffle intelligence or annoy the skilled workman. He simply wills, and it is done. So thoroughly has this been accomplished that it would seem as if the bounds of possibility had been reached, as if man had arrived at the limit beyond which only divinity can pass.</p>
<p>Is this true? Have we really come to the end of the journey of improvement as a craft? Must we be content with what has already been done, and make no effort to attain a loftier plane? Has the past been greater than the present can be? Have the mines of invention been so deeply and carefully worked that no golden nuggets remain undiscovered? Has the plummet sounded the uttermost depths and left nothing of use to be yet made known? It would be galling to our pride to acknowledge this, even were it true, but fortunately for civilization it is not. It was, in fact, but as the rude foundation to the magnificent structure of today, as today will be to the years to follow, and he who believes that printing, the most useful of all the arts, has reached the <em>ultima thule</em> is strangely blind to its destiny and inspiration. There never has been and never will be more than a passing check to its development, because underlying its progress is the interest of all humanity, discovery, enlightenment, and civilization.</p>
<p>With every step measuring the notes of the march of human progress must the printer keep time. Every forward move has created the necessity of another and a greater; every meritorious specimen of the typographic art has created a desire and a demand for something still higher in the scales of excellence, something still nearer to absolute perfection. To meet this requirement, to keep pace with the demands of the age, calls for incessant vigilance and continued improvement in workmanship, material, machinery, and labor-saving inventions.</p>
<p>“But,” questions the chronic doubter—and the question is pertinent—“where shall be found any power to assist in eclipsing the past, a more compact, cheaper motor than steam, a genie more potent than we now possess? Upon what depend these utopian dreams of the future?” The answer is so plain that a printer, of all other callings, should never need enlightenment on the subject. It is whispered to him by telegraph, voiced to him by telephone, and Franklin gave him the “key” to its subtle mystery when he caught the lightning and fettered its wanderings by the chains of a master will. True, much, we deem, is known of it now; but our present knowledge is as nothing to its coming uses, the film it throws over an electroplate is but as the gossamer web to what the fabric yet will be.</p>
<p><em>Electricity</em> will yet come to the printer as the spiritual inspiration that illuminated the minds of the German fathers of the art, as the solver of mysteries to the student in our own century. Its touch is magical, and its range of use beyond all present human calculation, though each day increases our knowledge, and each new development gives us a clearer insight into future possibilities. Already it has achieved wonders; has given us the most useful of “plates;” perfect and easy communication, be the distance what it may; has lighted our workshops as brightly as the noonday sun, and tuned our bells as with spiritual music. Why can it not do more? When we learn to control its forces, to make it entirely subservient to our wishes, may it not exceed even the most sanguine hopes of the “dreaming enthusiast”? It runs other machines, and why not printing-presses? It produces in stable form the type, and why may it not supersede type itself? It duplicates “cuts,” and why may not its delicate touches, mind-guided, engrave the cut itself? In a hundred ways it aids the printer now, and who shall dare to draw the line beyond which it shall pass?</p>

<p>Yea, gods such as De Vinne and Updike, who disputed this conventional wisdom, arguing instead that printing had degenerated and was in need of major reform.</p>
