  \ It's not the most beautiful newspaper but I would like to improve the look a bit.
  \ I would like to see what anyone has as far as type suggestions, for the header
  especially.\r\n \r\n At the moment Trajan is used for the Nameplate as well as the
  head of each section.  We use Times New Roman and Franklin gothic for the content.
  \ So far I have tried a few different things but none I have been  happy with, the
  closest I have been was to set it in Times bold.  Do the section heads warrant bringing
  a new typeface into the mix, or should I just stick to the the three we are using?\r\n\r\nbelow
  is the current look and a quick re-design.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJoshua\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    look at Jim Parkinson's website for inspiration. He appears to have some experience
