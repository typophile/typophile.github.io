body: 'I ordered the CS series directly from Adobe, mainly because I&#39;ve always
  bought directly from them. This time they messed up. When I ordered, I never mentioned
  I needed the Mac version and the sales person never asked, so &#40;you guessed&#41;
  they sent me Windows versions I ordered individual upgrades so each one came separately
  on different days. I ended having to send them back to Adobe and that was a chore.
  I had to get a RMA &#40;Return Merchandise Authorization&#41; that was promised
  to me in 48 hours, well 6 days later I had to spend another 1/2 hours on the phone
  to get the e-mail with the RMA. Life is good I got three of the four upgrades, wonderful,
  until today. Instead of sending the Illustrator upgrade, they sent me another InDesign
  upgrade. The problem will be resolved by tomorrow when I fax the Letter of Software
  Destruction and my Illustrator is being shipped. The customer support people are
  great, but I have to ask: Would I have had these problems if I had ordered from
  lets say Mac Warehouse? Dan'

    illustrator files backwards, or InDesign files for that matter.&#41;

    FINISHED talking with one of my employess about this. <BR> <BR>I think, especially
    in AI, there are the times that you need to save down to an AI 7 file. <BR> <BR>You
    will find that nearly ALL of the major sign producing software will not accept
    versions over 7, and if you do ANY design for billboards or commercial signage,
    this is a MUST. <BR> <BR>meanwhile, I still have all the older versions installed.
    <BR> <BR>In good word for Adobe, I had some trouble getting versionCue to work
    properly on our network, a call later and they have been very helpfull to walk
    through the process. <BR>Overall my support experience with them has been top
    notch. <BR> <BR>Now, Macromedia, they are a f&#42;cking joke. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.'

    FILE&#62;EXPORT&#62;ILLUSTRATOR LEGACY.  All type is converted to outlines, however.
    <BR>Also, FILE&#62;EXPORT&#62;INDESIGN INTERCHANGE.  Haven&#39;t used it yet,
    don&#39;t know how well it works.

  body: Unfortunately, although the InDesign interchange format exists, and was originally
    intended for purpose of getting InD CS documents back to InD 2, there is no import
    plug-in for InD 2. Basically it just wasn&#39;t going to work well enough to be
    useful so it was dropped.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    size/tracking/leading of text created in older versions.

  body: Ok. So to recap... <BR> <BR>InDesign has no way to save backwards. But, can
    you copy and paste from CS to 2? <BR> <BR>Illustrator has an export feature, bu
    all the type is turned to outlines? Can you copy and paste from CS to 10? <BR>
    <BR>This is me crying a river. I love some of the new things, but I&#39;m not
    so sure I would have upgraded to quickly. Please tell me I can copy and paste.  <BR>

    between them &#40;not sure about copying and pasting objects as opposed to text,
    will have to try this some time&#41;. <BR> <BR>When you save downwards in Illustrator
    you have a choice: &#34;Based on a preference in your Document Setup dialog, text
    will either be broken up into individual point text &#40;which is the default

  body: Got my Illustrator CS and all is good with Adobe again. Love the type engine,
    and I love the scribble feature, under effects. The 3D feature could be used for
    making gif animations in Image Ready, I will have to experiment with that. Dan
