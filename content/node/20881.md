  body: "It has a strong appeal but I think it isn't done quite yet.\r\n\r\nThe fisrt
    thing I notice is that while the v/r is litteraly centered it doesn't look quite
    centered. It's an optical illusion -  but it will need to be addressed I think.
    That issue should wait however until you resolve the final form of the v/r.\r\n\r\nThe
    form of the VR is good but I think it can be improved. The diagonal stress of
    the R bowl shape could be less pronounced maybe. Or what if you put the form on
    it's side. Right now you are tipping the fight for recognition too much in in
    favor of the v I think. If you put it on it's side ( I looked at it both ways)
    \ it becomes more ambigous and I found myself more rapidly cycling between recongnition
    of the v & r. More like the the old crone/young lady graphic where you see both
    & can go back & forth quickly. That said, I think that working with the R shape
    & the current vertical postion you might be able to get more rapid cycling of
    recognition too. Do you have more versions or tweaks? Also, what about taking
    the right side of the v and morphing it into the lower case r's arm? Did you try
    that?"

  body: I agree. It is a nice start but looks unfinished. The logomark needs some
    added interest. And the LogoType looks a bit bland, what about mixed caps or all
    caps. Although I think the font You are using is too bland altogethar.

  body: Sometimes when you are being adventurous in modification, a bland type is
    best...
