body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking at designing books for a sports book publisher.
  To that end I want to choose one serif and one sanserif type family which can be
  applied to all books, but are large enough to allow for a decent amount of variation.\r\n\r\nThe
  serif I think should be clean and modern, with a serious touch. Right now I'm considering
  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/utopia/|Utopia]]. For the sans I would like
  a lot of weights, and also oblique forms (preferably true italics). I'm thinking
  serious, but with a twist. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/|Interstate]]
  has occurred to me, but I'm not sure how well it works together with Utopia.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?\r\n\r\n/M\xE5ns "
