body: "In my web searches, I just came across a mention of Caslon Catalog, designed
  by \r\n\r\nIt is described as a Caslon with thicker hairlines. This sounds like
  the sort of thing I'd be interested in.\r\n\r\nHowever, I haven't been able to turn
  up a specimen anywhere. One confusing thing is that Robert Wiebking had also designed
  another revised Caslon, Clearface Caslon - and the description of it in a specimen
  notes that it was given thicker hairlines to look better on glossy paper, as used
  in catalogs. But that typeface was an earlier design of his, distinct from Caslon
  Catalog (also known as Caslon Antique, but having no connection with the better-known
  typeface by that name).\r\n\r\nAs I've noted, I'm interested in a Caslon that's
  a tad more authentic than Adobe Caslon, allows itself a bit more stroke contrast
  than Williams Caslon - but which doesn't have the look of an 'authentic' Caslon
  when printed with a 'kiss' impression - or digitally, or by lithography and phototypesetting.\r\n\r\nMy
  ideal Caslon would look a lot like the original printed broadsheet of the Declaration
  of Independence - an authentic Caslon thickened just enough by the printing process."

  body: Incidentally, I've learned from Gerald Giampa's P22 web site that American
    Caslon and New Caslon were closely related - American Caslon is stated there to
    be "the same face with longer ascenders". Actually, as can be seen from the specimen
    images on [[https://www.p22.com/lanston/giampa/NewCaslon.html|that site]], the
    <em>descenders</em> are (also?) longer for American Caslon.
