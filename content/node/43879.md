body: "I'm at the metrics and kerning stage now with my first serif -- a roman book
  face of standard weight. But before I start the endless tweaking I want to make
  sure everything is in order and my character set is nice and complete. I made a
  handful of (more-or-less accidental) discretionary [[ligature|ligatures]] in addition
  to the standards along the way and I was wondering if anyone has suggestions for
  other ones. I realise some would be, let's say 'indulgent', but it would be interesting
  to get a list going, useful for my particular design or not. My searching drew a
  blank on this one.\r\n\r\nSo let's hear 'em, serious or silly. (Unicode references
  would be handy for them too - I don't have them for my discretionary ones.)\r\n\r\n<strong>The

    etc., they can\u2019t be referred to as \u2018true ligatures\u2019 anymore. They
    are \u2018stand-alone\u2019 characters now.\r\nLigatures mostly solve problems
    of colliding characters. If your face doesn\u2019t suffer from such problems,
    then you don\u2019t need any additional ligatures.\r\nYou might wanna take a look

    Your f+umlauts/fj thread is very interesting too. Something I hadn't come across.
    (And perhaps something that as a native English speaker I was bound to overlook.)\r\n\r\nThat
    aside I'm still interested in other ligatures too: Those that perhaps have scant
    legitimacy beyond style, or what I meant by 'indulgent'. Like 'em or not.\r\n\r\nI
    doubt, for instance anybody's s and t ever collide!\r\n"

    why I\u2019ve started it. :-)\r\n\r\nAnother pointer: the thread that triggered
    the other one, on <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/40338\">The Most Useful
    OpenType Ligatures</a>.\r\n\r\nYou certainly have checked out some of the well-equipped
    OpenType text fonts that are out there, to examine which ligatures were included.
    It depends on the style, of course. A lot of today\u2019s text faces are revivals
    of, or \u2013 in a broader sense \u2013 are based on historical models. Thus,
    the designers often incorporate ligatures that have also been part of the original.
    This can relate to linguistics as to the specific style.\r\n\r\nOne frequently
    sees \u2018Th\u2019, for example. Also: ch, ck, ct, st, sp.\r\nAll kinds of combinations
    of f and characters with ascenders, also triples like ffb, ffh, ffk. Same for
    long s (\u017F), if you want to include that historic alternative.\r\n\r\nAn Italic
    may have even more. Adobe\u2019s Garamond Premier has ta, th, us, is, ij, ll,
    among a lot others. Have a look at Arno, Requiem or Galliard, too.\r\n\r\n"

  body: If you can look at Mrs Eaves, I'm not sure if i've ever seen more unique triple
    ligatures anywhere else. I've kinda had a falling out with the typeface because
    of it's over/improper use, but it may be a good reference point. Some of them
    seem slightly (but not completely) useless, like ffy, tty, ggy, ffj, THE, and
    my favorite-cky. There's also the OG, OC, OO, gi, and a bunch more...

    done some rummaging around inside the OpenTypes and I will now. Arno Pro is indeed
    a good tip which includes a lot of long s ligatures at my first glance.\r\n\r\nI
    guess then, that the st, sp type ligatures are either a scribal legacy or perhaps
    a gratuitous flourish on part of the designer. They are certainly decorative rather
    than practical (i.e. to prevent collision). I wonder if they test well in terms
    of readability compared to their individual counterparts or whether they're best
    put to use at display sizes."

  body: "ll is nice in an italic, though I'm still searching for a good design for
    a double l in non-italic type.  Ch / ch is nice, especially when designed so that
    it doesn't change spacing, so that it can be discreetly (as compared to, say,
    a ct lig) placed into a document.  For language where ch constitutes a separate
    letter it's definitely an nice effect.  Don't forget the capital DE ligature for
    Spanish, it's easy and quick to do so no reason not to include it IMO.\r\n\r\nOlho,
    some of those capital ligatures have a lot of history pre-printing presses.  For

  body: "Hmm. The Basque connection is certainly interesting. Another thing the linguistically
    lazy English speaker won't have come across. NA, TR and RA are quite spectacular
    in the graphic on that link. I think you'd need a keen eye to decipher TR which
    relies on the left arm of the T only and would probably look like a swash (or
    bastard?) lone R.\r\n\r\nAs for onomatop&oelig;ia, I think Nick's closer in thinking
    it's an aid to pronunciation, -- Like the di&aelig;resis is in 'na&iuml;ve' or
    'Zo&euml;' -- despite English being largely non-phonetic.\r\n\r\nAmerican usage
    of English seems to strip both the ae and oe digraphs and replace them with a
    single e. As an English English speaker I ought to object, but the lone e does
    make some sense to me -- though I'll admit my fusty British heritage is squealing
    to object as I type. In terms of visual language -- i.e. set type on the page
    -- I can't help preferring Words like 'Encyclopaedia' to 'Encyclopedia' and 'Encyclop&aelig;dia'
    is even better. Also, I suppose keeping the digraph respects more faithfully the
    word's etymology. Things change though and as there are more Americans speaking
    English in the world than Brits I can't see the &aelig;/&oelig; digraphs surviving.\r\n"
