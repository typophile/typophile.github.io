    N and Y there is slight variation than what Akzidenz-Grotesk has (the sharp angles).
    I circled the part I am talking about. Thanks!\r\n\r\nhttp://s260.photobucket.com/albums/ii18/pantshappy1/?action=view&current=scan56.jpg "

    without hi-res capability, it's difficult to know what the ink traps look like."

    Lead type often has those little notches cut in to control the typeface better
    optically on an letterpress. The ink tends to get pushed out ever-so-slightly.
    Later digital versions of many typefaces eliminated this."

    out. As printing still involves ink and paper (though the overall quality has
    improved), the ink traps still are around \u2013 also in digital typefaces."
