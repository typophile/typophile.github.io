  used symbols (ex: \xA4, \xA7, \u2020, \u2021, etc.)\r\n\r\nNot that I don't know
  anything about these, but I'm doing a bit of typographic education for non-typophile
  friends/collegues that want to know the origin and use of special symbols.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions ?"

    target=\"new\">Chicago Manual of Style</a> for teaching about proper usage of
    footnote symbols, section/double section marks, daggers, double daggers, &c.\r\n\r\nYou
    might want to try finding one the your local library, as I had a much older version
    and don't know if they deleted all the good 'ol stuff (I doubt they did)."
