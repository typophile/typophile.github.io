  is pretty hard to read at times. Normally I read magazines without reading glasses
  as I cook the evening meal, but this time it wasn't that easy. Or what do you think
  of a 155 mm wide text in 7 pt? There are pages with sensible columns, too, not all
  the pages look like that (thankfully!).\r\n\r\nI like the serif and sans fonts,
  but the techno leaves me cold and is pretty difficult to read, too\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Barack_5683.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks for the id, Stefan, I wasn't 100 % sure about it. Freight is used
    in a very varied way all through the magazine, which is nice. \r\n\r\nThe attachment
    (Q_review) in the original message shows the wide column. For me it's just a good
    example of how difficult it is to read overtly wide text, you lose your place
    so easily."
