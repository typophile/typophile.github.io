body: What typeface should I pair up with Gotham Condensed (bold)? I'm using Gotham
  condensed in my logo and was wondering about the typeface that would best compliment
  it in an identity system. Please help!!!

  body: "Font pairing is a bit subjective under the best of conditions, but without
    being able to see your logo I\u2019d hesitate to make a recommendation. \r\n\r\nThe
    website Fonts in Use may be of help to you. Depending on whether you are looking
    for a serif or another sans serif typeface to pair with Gotham, the samples at
    this link might provide some inspiration:\r\nhttp://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/20/gotham"

    body: Thank you so much! That is so helpful! My first instinct was to use Trade
      Gothic too. I think to use a serif compliments this really well. I eventually
      made a website for this logo/ identity system, so would Minion pro work well
      as a web font? Or should I stick to a serif?
