  body: less colours is a lot easier to work with. limit your design to 2 or 3 colours.

  body: 'If you are going to print images (photos), think that you need lower ''lineature''.
    Most offset are done as 150 or 175 lines per inch. On silk screen you would need
    less, say 133, maybe less. '
