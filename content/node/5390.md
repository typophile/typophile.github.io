  <BR>There have been a lot of dicussions on Typophile recently that have made me
  wonder: what would the type industry be like, and what would the public perception
  of type and typography be, if standard fonts packages were not bundled with operating
  systems software or word processing software?&#42; &#40;aside from system fonts,
  of course&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;I believe someone recently mentioned a country where
  font bundling with OSes is, in fact, illegal. <BR> <BR>Just last Friday, I educated
  a coworker on the wonderful world of fonts, what the actual differences were between
  fonts like Garamond and Times, and why they cost &#34;so much money,&#34; as she
  put it. After describing all of the basic design and technological components, she
  completely understood. She also wholeheartedly agreed that people would be much
  more generally aware, if, instead of receiving a pre-fab fonts package with their
  software, they were offered the opportunity to choose, say 50 fonts from a larger
  list. She also said that <i>she would prefer this method</i>. <BR> <BR>In my mind,
  I see the result being a totally different dynamic between the public, and type
  designers, and their distributors, wherein consumers expect to pay for quality,
  and are aware that fonts are a consumable good that can help or harm their work,
  much like a computer, or a piece of software, or a car, or a printer. This would
  stand in contrast to the current situation, where many people don&#39;t even consider
  fonts to be the work of people, let alone an achievement requiring skill and time.
  I&#39;d also imagine that this awareness and subsequent attention to a largely rarified
  and ignored market would drive demand up and prices down. This could also popularize
  the notion of buying fonts for specific purposes, much like we buy outfits for particular
  purposes. Of course, the attendant curses of piracy, fads, and pop-culture homogeneity
  could overrun any positives, I suppose. <BR> <BR>Computers and software &#40;and,
  in a way, the typewriter&#41; have reinforced the idea of fonts as small features
  of word processing and typing, rather than significant expressive and communicative
  devices. The OS and software developers remove the necessity of choice, and perpetuate
  &#40;to some extent&#41; the belief that people don&#39;t buy and choose fonts,
  they select them from menus dictated by software companies. The web completes this
  triangle of perception by reinforcing the idea that fonts are available for free
  and commonly exchanged. Would removing fonts from the equation solve some of these
  problems? Ironically, because of these groups and devices, we are in a unique place
  in history where the means to output typeset &#40;I use the term loosely&#41; materials
  are accessible to many at a <i>much</i> lower point of entry, in both price and
  complexity. Is this an opportunity for positive development, or is this a pipe dream?
  &#40;ignoring, for a moment, the logistics of changing the current system&#41; <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;m eager to hear more experienced perspectives on this situation, which
  has been the standard for me throughout my design education and career. I&#39;m
  particularly interested by the opinions of those of you running your own smaller
  type businesses.'

  body: Nick claims that font bundling with OSes and applications is illegal in Canada.
    I believe that his interpretation of the relevant law is more than a little suspect.
    He seems to think that bundling software together is legally the same as giving
    some of the pieces away for free. I suggest that&#39;s a question for lawyers
    and courts, but I am unaware of any cases relating to that Canadian law which
    support Nick&#39;s interpretation. <BR> <BR>In any case, the main problem with
    giving users a choice of fonts is that it means another variable that you&#39;ve
    introduced that makes everybody&#39;s setups different. Even though you and I
    are both using &#34;only what came with the computer&#34; we will have different
    sets of fonts. From the point of view of diversity that&#39;s great, but it makes
    it harder for us to work together. It also means tons more testing and development
    for the folks selling the OS/apps, and increases their support costs. <BR> <BR>I
    like the idea personally, but I suspect that app/OS developers are unlikely to
    take the route to that extreme any time soon. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I can
    easily imagine with a situation like the Adobe Creative Suite, where you had a
    choice of &#34;registration incentives&#34; and one of them was a font family,
    one could offer a choice of several different families instead. Not quite as extreme,
    but still plays on the same theme. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    <BR> <BR>Chris, new technology offers the opportunity for all kinds of change,
    and the coming of digital media would seem to lead to a decentralization and democratization
    of power and wealth. However, it&#39;s a battle that large corporate interests
    &#40;even if they started out small&#41; always seem to end up winning. <BR> <BR>I
    would love to challenge Adobe and Apple in court, because the way I see it, the
    situation is hugely unfair, and there are laws against unfair business practices.
    Here I am, trying to sell fonts to people who have already been supplied, free
    of charge, with a large selection along with their operating system and major
    software applications. But really Thomas, easy for you to say this is a matter
    for lawyers and courts, but what a waste of time and money it would be for me
    to test the legality of this practice in court. <BR> <BR>Leaving aside the amateur
    or prosumer market for now, my potential customers are design professionals who,
    by and large &#40;ie 95%&#41; use Apple computers and Adobe software. These software
    giants are, to all intents and purposes, and notwithstanding Corel and web designers
    on Wintel, monopolists. So when they bundle fonts, everyone gets them. <BR>I&#39;m
    very familiar with their customer, because before I started my foundry in 1999,
    I was one of them &#40;an art director&#41;. From 1989 to about  1993, I bought
    a lot of fonts. Then, Quark and Adobe started releasing their major upgrades on
    CD, and Adobe started bundling large numbers of fonts on the CDs. <BR> <BR>As
    Pamela Pfiffner says in the Adobe book &#34;Inside the Publishing Revolution&#34;,  the
    early years of digital were a boom for Adobe font sales. But the boom levelled
    off as designers rounded out their font libraries, as more digital foundries entered
    the competition, as piracy and free fonts became widespread, facilitated by the
    Internet, and as, most significantly from my perspective as a font user, I was
    getting a large supply of fonts &#40;spam, according to Gerald&#41; from Adobe
    every time I upgraded Illustrator. <BR> <BR>Bundling is continued with the CS,
    and Apple has upped its participation, with a large collection of fonts &#40;not
    system fonts&#41; that come with OS X. <BR> <BR>The numbers involved are quite
    shocking in the disparity between what is acquired by the licensee and what is
    paid for. <BR>A top selling &#34;indie&#34; typeface may perhaps sell, at a guess,
    a couple of thousand copies worldwide, during a year. However, every font included
    in an Adobe bundle is distributed by the million. <BR> <BR>Historically, very
    few type designers have made much of a living at it. Now it&#39;s a bit better,
    but, compared to the potential of digital media, all those hundreds of millions
    of computer users as potential retail customers, the realization may be even smaller.  <BR>
    <BR>Perhaps I am wrong on this, as I have no data to support my claim, other than
    my own experience and observations, but I believe that the vast majority of independent
    foundries are able to exist thanks to custom work and niche markets of publications
    and corporations that require large multi-user licences, while the &#34;retail&#34;
    mass market of millions of graphic artists/designers does not support them. And
    of course, many independent foundries are also supported by the &#34;other&#34;
    work of their pricupal&#40;s&#41;, such as graphic design. <BR> <BR>There appear
    to be other niches that are profitable for indie foundries, genres such as pixel
    fonts, and scripts, but it&#39;s worth noting that these are genres that have
    little or no representation in the bundles from Adobe and Apple. <BR> <BR>'

    process to find MULTIPLE uses, and thus multiply its revenue). Following this
    example: if a font designer designs a font, and company A produces something which
    includes the design of the font (say, a logo), Company A is receiving revenues
    from its product, but the type designer is not... but it could, yes? Couldn't
    type designers, graphic artists, even basic human labor receive a percentage of

    In the case I'm thinking of, someone got a design patent on something I and others
    had both built & used years earlier. I didn't care, it's my hobby only, but the
    patentee got one major company to pay him off before other major companies made
    it go away. \r\n\r\nTo put everything in terms of cliches, (1) God fights on the

    a head start. Business ain't about what's right.\r\n\r\nAs for Adobe-- let's see,

    you make this sound like a new thing. But US design patent #1, back in 1842, was
    for a typeface by George Bruce.  http://www.google.com/patents?vid=D1  So it is
    hardly an Adobe innovation. Are you saying Adobe was the first to resume this
    practice in the digital age? That may very well be.\r\n\r\nAluminum wrote: \"I
    think it's a a bit of an assumption that bundled Operating System fonts directly
    take away from sales potential of other fonts.\"\r\n\r\nWhich is true, but it
    seems that at least the fonts that are bundled are sure to sell less.\r\n\r\n\"It
    makes sense only if one assumes every purchaser of an operating system has a vested
    interest in purchasing commercial fonts.\"\r\n\r\nThat is clearly not logically
    true. It makes sense if you assume that SOME purchasers of OSes would be interested
    in purchasing fonts if hardly any were bundled, and that SOME portion of their
    demand for fonts will be sated by bundled fonts.\r\n\r\nEven when I was at Adobe,
    I don't think I ever disputed Nick Shinn's arguments that bundled fonts reduced
    the sales of other fonts. Of course they do. It's only a question of how much,
    and whether it's perceived as \"good\" (value for end users) or \"bad\" (reduced
    sales for folks who are not the lucky ones whose fonts got bundled).\r\n\r\nRegarding
    bundling of fonts vs whether \"average users\" would pay for fonts, there was
    a brief period in the early 90s when computers were taking off, few fonts were
    bundled, and quality fonts were sold in high volumes to average users, but in
    heavily discounted bundles (not so much with apps, except Corel's, mostly just
    fonts).\r\n\r\nThen once large numbers of fonts were bundled with OSes and apps,
    and the cheap bundles had sold lots, the retail market for full-price fonts collapsed
    in a hurry, around 1994 or so. The big corporate version of the type industry
    has never been the same since.\r\n\r\nCharles E wrote: \"As I understand it, in
    the United States at least, a type face *design* cannot be copyright protected.\"\r\n\r\nQuadibloc
    replied: \"That *was* true, but now there is some limited protection for font
    designs in the U.S.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Quadibloc is under some misconception that
    design patent for fonts is the same as copyright, and that this is new? But as
    mentioned above, it is 170 years old. I know of no new, limited protections for
    font designs in the abstract (as opposed to their instantiations as specific computer
    font files).\r\n\r\nUS design patent has a very brief term, and only exists after
    an expensive registration process. That's why pretty much nobody besides Adobe
    uses this approach."

    is not protected by copyright in the USA. However, the implementation of that
    design as a font file is protected like software.\r\n\r\nStatus quo in the USA:
    The copyright office accepts registrations of the font file code, and the Adobe
    v SSi case upheld the principle in federal district court. But that's not new:
    registration of fonts dates back about 20 years, and the court ruling was 15 years
