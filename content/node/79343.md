  will be show correct in Indesign or Illustrator.\r\n\r\nIf I generate the Font and
  open it in Indesign and look at the Indesign glyph palette there is just chaos (f.e.
  you see one after another C, c.sc., cdot.sc, c, cdot etc). I like to change the
  order, maybe capital-group, smallcap-group, figures and so on.\r\n\r\nI hope somebody
  comprehend.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\not"

  body: "It's the glyph index number in your own font.\r\n\r\nI re-sorted my own phonetics
    set, putting all 'a' variants together, then all 'b' variants, etc. (And the upside
    down 'v' is not in my 'a' section, where it belongs -- phonetically, that is --
    but it's in my 'v' section because I sorted by eye.)\r\nThat way I can set the
    Glyph panel sorting to Unicode if I know the code to insert, or to Glyph Index
    if I don't have a clue and must hunt by eye."

  body: "There are two criteria to sort glyphs in ID panel: by Unicode and by index.
    This is chosen in the panel menu. You don't have control over Unicode sorting
    as ID simply follows the sequence of codepoints. But for index sorting ID would
    show exactly the order you defined in FontLab.\r\n\r\nFor index sorting, you must
    set FontLab maping mode to use \"Glyph Index\" and then freely drag-n-drop glyphs
    to define the desired order:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample-fl_3417.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>FontLab
    maping mode menu in font window.</em>\r\n\r\nInDesign let you set the order criteria
    in the panel menu (this sample is in Portuguese, but the menu order is the same
    in all languages):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample-id_5072.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>InDesign
    sorting mode in Glyph panel.</em>\r\n\r\nIf you don't see the same order in FL
    and ID for your font, test how ID exhibits glyphs from other fonts to identify
    if the problem come from it. "

    I'm quite sure the CID/GID (Character ID/Glyph ID) order is the exact order in
    the font file. If there is a discrepancy with FontLab, it's the latter that's
    wrong :-) (there are a lot of sorting options in FontLab, you'll have to find
    the 'don't sort at all' one)."

    show exactly the order you defined in FontLab.</em>. FL is the usual suspect,
    but it always possible to get some strange error in ID \u2013and to check it is
    simple."
