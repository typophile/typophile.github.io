Yeah I'd say they're worth an hour each. <BR> <BR>To my eye the &quot;Art Center at Night  Summer 2005&quot; spreads away from the counter too much at its endpoints. The &quot;Lea&hellip;&quot; portion of &quot;Learn&hellip;&quot; looks maybe a little too tightly curled and the &quot;&hellip;own fonts&quot; not tightly enough. <BR> <BR>I can't really tell what's going on with the &quot;m&quot; in &quot;pm&quot;. In the drawing it looks sadly scrunched but on the wood background photo it looks fine while in the hangings I'm not too sure. Maybe a redraw of the m? Maybe just move the &quot;Wednesday&quot; to the left more so the &quot;m&quot; doesn't have to turn down? <BR> <BR><i>&hellip;and I might make two more, but that's it.</i> suggests maybe no more time is warranted. <BR> <BR>Whatever.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I think your first idea was a very good one.  With some adjustments with the date (reduce the size to avoid to break the smooth line at the end) and the register line (be more in the same curv as the bottom tail of the g). I  will keep the good suggestion from Eben how he used the text in the top tail. I'd also suggest to use a sans typeface instead of a serif one for the text inside the g. <BR> <BR>Good work.</div>
