body: I am designing a short book telling the story of my grandmother's journey from
  Poland to Canada during WWII. I am looking for some advice on what to use for the
  typeface throughout the book. The chapter headings will all be hand-lettered. The
  dimensions of the book are 10.5x9. I'm still debating whether or not to do it double
  column or not. Does anyone have any thoughts on what to do about margins on a book
  of these dimensions? Thanks for the help, guys.

  body: Oh yeah, another thing I forgot. I would like the book to have the feel of
    a book from the era. I was thinking of using a typeface that wasn't quite perfect.
    Something that might have a slightly damaged look to it but not in the grunge
    vein. It also needs to have a large enough character base so as to be able to
    work with some Polish words.

    and at small sizes. Nice lookin' typeface though.

  body: "david,\r\nhow are your pages set up? its hard to say if you should go double
    column or not without knowing how much of the page youre planning to fill with
    text.\r\nmaking assumptions from what youve said above, 10.5 inches is really
    wide not to go double column with type set at small sizes. then again, it may
    be elegant to have the text set in a single column, leaving a lot of white space
    on the page.\r\nare there other elements that will occupy space on the page such
    as sidenotes, sidebars, captions, photographs, or illustrations?\r\n\r\n[im writing
    this reply with the intent of it helping me to remember to reply again when i
    am on my own computer, as i have a typeface that has a five letter name that may
    fit your description perfectly. i cannot remember the name right now though...
    im trying to look at my font list in my mind and it is not working]\r\n\r\nin
    the meantime, here are a few thoughts:\r\nRegula: http://stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-65-regula\r\n
    - probably too distressed\r\nRegent: http://stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-40-regent\r\n
    - similar feel minus the distressed aspect\r\nBiblon Pro: http://stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-78-biblon-pro\r\n\r\ni
    dunno if the baroque connotations in the above three are undesirable... but they
    all have central european diacritics. if they dont work, maybe youll see something
    else storm that fits better, i think all of his typefaces have ce diacritics.
    \r\ni cant think of anything else right now, sorry my suggestions are so diverse.
    haaah...\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the help, critter. The project is actual joint with my sister
    who is compiling the text and doing the majority of the editing work on it. The
    book is really her brain-child. We had a talk this morning about the book and
    decided to design it with a double column. The margins we are thinking of using
    are:\r\n\r\ntop - 1.5\"\r\nbottom - 1\"\r\ninside - 1.25\"\r\noutside - 1\"\r\n\r\nThe
    columns will have a .375\" gutter between them. This should provide us with enough
    space above the text to place photo captions, notes, pronunciation keys, etc.
    Photos will span either one or both columns.\r\n\r\nThe fonts you provided are
    quite nice. Regula is a little too distressed as you side and Biblon doesn't quite
    suit the look we're going for. Regent is really good though and I'm going to talk
    to my sister about getting it. I'd still really like to know the name of the other
    font you were thinking of.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else has thoughts I'd love to hear
    them as well. Thanks guys."

    binding generally uses more of the inner margin than stitched). Bringhurst gives
    good advice on the average number of characters per line and book design. Generally
    you should aim for an average of between 50-66 characters per line \u2013 start
    with that and work out how much space you have left. For more specific advice
    try out some settings and post them in the Critique forum. Just for clarity \u2013

    for linguistics, critical text edition, etc.  A tex or latex input file contains
    commands to tell how the text or the formula should be typeset (it is not \"what
    you see is what you get\"). Many scientific journals expect articles to be submitted
    in latex and provide packages for those wanting to submit, so that they get on
    their laser printer something resembling the final published text (and comply

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am new to these fora and love what I am reading here. I take
    the liberty of chiming in as I have finished a similar project using Adobe InDesign.
    The rule of thumb for columns is 1\xBD lowercase alphabets in whatever font you
    decide to use, i.e.,\r\n\r\n1 column width = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm\r\n\r\nThis
    is a font dependent calculation and if using a very narrow font might even yield
    three columns, or conversely a single column with wide margins for very wide fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    apologize if this is already assumed and I am merely pointing the blatantly obvious.\r\n\r\nI
    would add that I use InDesign for any publication longer than one page, i.e, books,
    Quarterly Reports, MMPs* MOPs*, and presentations.\r\n\r\n*Procedure books for

    column of text with larger images that break into the white space.  (I assume
    one or more pictures on most pages, and these are to be played up ... that is,
    made relatively large.) \r\n\r\nI would suggest going to the library or a bookstore
    and browsing through similar types of books, and getting a feel for what you think

    have given you the specs and that did nothing."

    to keep browsing around looking for a typeface to use in the hopes that something
    stands out strong.

    difference between hard and soft cover as well as the different pricing between
    the paper stocks we can use. Budget is a huge factor in this. Because there will
    be photos throughout we will not be going with the standard crappy paperback book
    paper stock. I'm really not a book designer (yet. i hope to get into it more)
    so all of this is very new to me. I want to learn as much as I can.
