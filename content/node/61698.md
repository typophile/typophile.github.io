  of Printing? I'm looking for an article by David Rutt covering [[http://www.katranpress.com/stamps_gill_1_1.html|Eric
  Gill's postage stamp designs]]. I actually have an <em>old</em> photocopy of this
  article, but am hoping to get some scans of the illustrations. I can't find a copy
  locally (Boston) or even many mentions to this journal online. As always, any help
  or hints would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nMichael"

    the library or archive department at LCP or LCC as they are now?\r\nIf you have
    but have not had and sucess post some more details and i will have a go; as an
    alumni i might have a bit more luck!\r\n\r\nWill"

    isn't listed as being held. Actually, it seems they only have a few copies from
    the 60s. I think I'll take your advice and actually try <em>writing</em> to a
    <em>real</em> person to see what's what."
