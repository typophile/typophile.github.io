body: "Hey everyone! \r\n\r\nI am looking for an awesome typeface for a cigar store
  that I am branding. I am thinking a san-serif, but I'm open to suggestions that
  are not. It needs to be masculine, strong and upscale. I love the identity for Cavalier
  Essentials and want a similar feel. \r\n\r\nThanks for the help!\r\nKathryn\r\n\r\nhttp://cavalieressentials.com/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cavalier_5097.jpeg]"

    from [[http://www.emigre.com/fonts.php|Emigre]]. Also did you think of using a
    display didone typeface such as [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/alias/oban_ot/|Oban]]?\r\n\r\n\r\nSB"

  body: "Brothers is a great suggestion.\r\n\r\nAlso, look through [[http://www.losttype.com/
    | Lost Type Co-op]] (pay what you want, vintage-inspired typefaces).  So many
    would be great here.  Ranger, Deming, Liberator, Duke, Tommaso, and Muncie especially.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I'd consider [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/archivetype/archive-steeler/ | Archive
    Steeler]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/archivetype/archive-tinted/ | Archive

    fit the bill and have supercool layering possibilities.

    Fonts]], such as [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/banknote.php|Bank Note]]
    if you do opt for a serif. You might like some of their [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/centennialpanels1.php|panel
    fonts]] too.
