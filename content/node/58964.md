    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/din-neuzeit-grotesk/\">DIN Neuzeit
    Grotesk</a>\r\n\r\nSince this is obviously pre-digital, the question is going
    to be whether there is a digital equivalent\u2026 Futura can get you somewhat
    close, but you'll have to customize that \"J\".\r\nYou might also want to look
    at <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-706/\">Geometric
    706</a>.\r\n\r\nI hope someone else will know of a better match."

  body: Thanks for the help. I'd suspected that it wouldn't be digitised, but had
    hoped that it might be. Geometric 706 is a really nice font as well.

  body: "Hard to see, but it looks like the acute vertices in N and W in the sample
    are pointed, which isn't the case with the guesses so far.\r\nLooks like some
    takeoff from Futura - if you know where it was printed maybe that could lead to
    finding expertise about local variants."
