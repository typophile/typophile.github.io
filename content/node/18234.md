  \r\nthe briefing of this project consists on realizing a catalog of \"Typography\r\nand
  Typographers on the XXth Century\" the motor to ingnite the project was \r\nthe
  \"SupertipoVeloz\" by Trochut an outreageous  example of modular typography;\r\ni
  would be widely interested on recieving any type of information on these\r\narea,
  because I had found only  experimental  typographyies of the beginings\r\nof the
  century (vanguard). Thank you for your attention.  "

    answer: a large storehouse such as The British Library, which could be considered
    an example of modular typography, with book as module."

    Stencil</a> comes to mind: it uses a limited number of standard shapes to produce
    an entire character set. It''s certainly not as comprehensive as Trochut''s designs,
    however.'

  body: "Supertipo Veloz was a \"typographic system for the small printer\" developed
    by Catal\xE1n designer Joan Trochut Blanchard in 1942. The \"system\" consisted
    of  several series (or modules) of building blocks (usually 14) from which one
    could construct any number of alphabetic variations. Additional complementary
    forms (swashes, tails, flourishes) were also available. A limited sample, illustrating
    the basic principle, appears below:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/super_veloz.gif]\r\n\r\nThere's
    a nice article about the series in <em>Baseline</em> Vol. II, No. 2. A typographic
    conference in Spain in the last year or so (sorry, details escape me at the moment)
    had an exhibition of Trochut's work, for which a catalog was published. I'd love
    to buy a copy, but everywhere I've located the book (all in Europe), the postage
    costs as much or more than the book itself. And, at one point in time, Typerware
    had a \"Trochut project\" in the works, but it seems to have disappeared. I think
    I have a complete set of the building blocks in at least one of Trochut's modules
    in my \"do something useful with my downtime\" file folder at work; if you'd like
    to see more, I'll see if I can locate and post it.\r\n\r\nIn any event, I love
    Trochut's work: my freeware font <strong>Conga Line</strong>, as well as my commercial
    works <strong>Novadam Obese</strong> and <strong>Super Bob Triline</strong> are
    all based on \"the system.\""

  body: "Thanks Nick, well put.\r\nNow I get it.\r\n\r\nEdmund Fry's \"Great Primer
    Script\" used modular components.\r\nThe frontispiece of his 1824 Specimen is
    a fold-out: \"A Scale to Facilitate the Composition of Edmund Fry's Great Primer
    Script\".\r\nSorry, I don't have an image. It must have been a virtuoso task for
    compositors to work with Fry's system.\r\n\r\n\"Fregio Mecano\" (Italian, 1920s,
    anon.) is shown in \"130 Alphabets and Other Signs\" (page 102-103). An iteration
    of its system is marketed by Monotype as \"Section Bold Condensed\".\r\n\r\nRian
    Hughes (Device) recent \"Klaxon\" shows an interesting way to construct a face
    from a limited number of components, along the lines of \"LCD\" (Alan Birch, 1981)\r\n"

  body: "Here's a comparison of modular units for <strong>Albers Stencil</strong>,
    one of the <strong>Supertipo Veloz</strong> modules, and a typeface I recently
    released based on the work of Dutch designer <strong>H. Th. Wijdeveld</strong>,
    another De Stijl pioneer.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trochut.gif]\r\n\r\nAlthough
    both Albers Stencil and Architectuur have twelve basic building blocks, Wijdeveld's
    system is by far the simpler: he constructed his letters out of stock brass rules,
    with only straight-line segments."
