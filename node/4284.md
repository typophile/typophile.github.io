body: This is something I was playing with for some time.  <BR>Fatum Eurydicae &#40;Eurydica&#39;s
  Destiny&#41;is a name for arty-farty cafe&#43;giftshop, elite yet a bit kitchy.
  I was trying to achieve some kind of baroque feeling. <BR>I was fooling around with
  some of my favorite typefaces - Garamond, English and Bull. Your opinion, please.

  body: The &#34;v&#34;s used as &#34;u&#34;s confuses me. Am I naive? Is this a practice
    used in some circles that would make it obvious to your target? I don&#39;t read
    it at all. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: Scott, the V would be latin for U. But, I agree, it&#39;s OK to cheat here
    and use a real U for readability&#39;s sake. <BR> <BR>I like the logo, btw, though
    &#34;FATVM&#34; seems to be floating a bit too much there.

  body: I like the name and the direction you&#39;re going with combining a script
    and a text face. What sort of identity will this be for? Just a window sign? Or
    napkins, menus, gift bags, etc? <BR> <BR>I think if you&#39;re going to use the
    Latinized spelling of FATVM, then you should use an &#34;obvious&#34; Roman stonecut
    font, like <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/index.html">Requiem</a>
    or similar. You might want to spell &#39;Eurydice&#39; in the modern fashion to
    avoid people seeing Every Dice. <BR> <BR>Also, I think the &#39;ae&#39; ligature
    looks a bit much like an &#39;oe&#39;.

    serif capitals - dunno, I kinda like this look. <BR>They were thinking of using
    this logo on employee&#39;s uniform, shopping bags etc. <BR> '

    between the E and d.

  body: I&#39;ve made some changes - final ligature and &#34;u&#34;. I didn&#39;t
    want to decrease the space between words too much, since I wanted to keep in some
    &#34;drama&#34;. In my eyes the first thing you notice is Eurydica in rather romantic
    script. Placing Fatum &#40;Fate&#41; a bit on the side I wanted to create some
    kind of chill. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33559.jpg"

  body: I don&#39;t mind the placement of Fatum offset to the left; actually, I think
    it looks pretty good in that general vicinity. The changes you&#39;ve made certanly
    improve readability. Is there another lc Y you could use to avoid/minimize that
    hole between &#39;r&#39; and &#39;y&#39;? <BR> <BR>I think this marque is great
    for printed materials, but you might have some translation issues when going to
    clothing or vinyls for a window. The size difference between Fatum and Eurydice
    would make the former very small on an embroidered shirt or apron, and the &#39;grunge&#39;
    face might not be easy to cut out of vinyl. <BR> <BR>Good progress.

  body: 1.  I don&#39;t think the Garamond is working here.  The italics just don&#39;t
    look consistent enough to be used at display sizes. <BR> <BR>2.  I Think you need
    to consider the historical implications of your typefaces.  The average member
    of the populace won&#39;t know that Garamond is a Renassaince face, but the subconscious
    association is probably there nonetheless.  If you&#39;re doing something with
    historical meaning, why not consider a face from that period? <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re
    stuck on the sans/serif combination, you might try a lapidary like Sophia or Lithos
    with a display Roman like Trajan.

  body: '@ DP:  <BR>Thank you for your opinion.  <BR>I think I got historical association
    exactly where I wanted. The thing is, I didn&#39;t want it to look Roman &#40;or
    Grecian&#41;, I wanted it to look early Baroque, Classical in Louis XIV kind of
    way. Fatum Eurydicae sounds to me like a title of H. Purcell&#39;s play, or some
    of his conteporaties.  <BR>Think about it like that movie Gladiator - although
    it takes place in ancient Rome, theme, characters, costumes etc. are Baroque,
    not Antique.'

  body: 'Hylas, I think the execution here could be improved by  <BR>some customization.
    <BR> <BR>fatum: the left arm of the u/v has a notch that heightens <BR>the confusion
    as to what the letter is supposed to be. <BR> <BR>E: the script E seems too much
    like <BR>a stock E out of a generic Copperplate face <BR>... you could redraw
    this with some <BR>different flourishes to make it yours. <BR>A redraw would also
    allow you the opportunity <BR>to fit the u with the E. As is, they seem much <BR>too
    far apart. <BR> <BR>ae: the bowl of the e appears too small. <BR> <BR>d: the looped
    ascender looks like it was cut <BR>and pasted on. Could be the .gif. The specific

  body: It&#39;s Latin, so the closes pronounciation would be like in Italian {E like
    in b<b>E</b>d, U like in b<b>OO</b>t, R like in <b>R</b>ed, y like in happ<b>Y</b>,
    d like in <b>D</b>ay, i like in sh<b>EE</b>p, c like ch in <b>CH</b>eer, ae like
    e in b<b>E</b>ed} Or you can pronounce it like in Central Europe, with Tz instedad
    of Ch, or like K instead of Ch. Every spelling is equaly incorrect, since Latin
    is a dead language. Since I&#39;m not working in English-speaking country, nobody
    will read it like EV&#39;RY DICE &#40;so nobody would think it is a casino <IMG

  body: I agree with BJ, if you&#39;re going for a Baroque feel, you should work in
    some custom flourishes on the curved ascender of the D and perhaps the descender
    on the Y. Perhaps even &#34;tail&#34; the E portion of the ae lig. <BR> <BR>Actually,
    you could connect your flourish on the Y to the end of the uppercase E for a nice
    complete look.

    <BR>2. It&#39;s not a Starbuck&#39;s - people go there to look posh, not to drink
    coffee &#40;or to read books&#41;. It&#39;s a place where you dress yourself as

    books. <BR>3. Fatum &#40;Destiny&#41;is too general. The name Eurydica&#39;s Fate
    is chosen as a sort of a warning, meaning DON&#39;T LOOK BACK!  <BR>

  body: In my opinion Eurydicae is not working. The E is heavy and of a completely
    different nature than the rest. The d is throwing off the rythm. I think it will
    want to be right leaning, perhaps with a loop that curls around and crosses itself
    moving back toward the E. <BR> <BR>See if you can find lettering to work from.
    Or a better drawn font. BJ has rightly pointed out some issues with this one.
