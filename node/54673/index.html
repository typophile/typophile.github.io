In my opinion in real life the opposite is true, the anonymous uploader stands little chance of being brought to justice, but the person who associates their name with a project that uses unlicensed fonts is 100 times more likely to find themselves in hot water.

		<div class="commentbody">To nit-pik, I'm not sure in what context it'd ever be illegal to 'upload' a font.

Putting a file on a server, in and of itself, doesn't typically have any 'illegal' connotations to it.

Now if this server happens to be public, and advertises the fact you can download copies of the file from it, then one could argue there was intent involved and said intent could be construed as being illegal.

Bottom line, if the digital files are protected by copyright or licensing or the like, then yea, any use outside of those parameters could easily be illegal.

		<div class="commentbody">> Is it illegal to download illegally uploaded fonts?

Generally speaking, you must distinguish two cases:

1) If the design for the downloaded font had been registered (e.g. at the design office in Alicante for Europe) and the registration was valid and is has not yet expired, then downloading of fonts whose design was registered is illegal, if the downloader lives in Europe or in the country where the font had been registered.

2) If the design for the downloaded font was not registered and if the downloader of the uploaded font never concluded any contract with the seller of the font, there does not exist any contractual (or EULA) link between downloader and seller of the font with the consequence that the downloader can only be sued, if the seller proves that the font is a computer program the source code of which was written by a natural person. Nobody can prove this, because fonts are not computer programs written by natural authors. Even Chief Justice Roberts (who was recently seen at the Obama swearing ceremony) would never swear that fonts are computer programs (see http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/publicdomain.pdf, pages 2). The fairy tale that fonts are computer programs or "software" was invented to cheat dimwitted font buyers. No sane person believes this rubbish, let alone the American Chief Justice Roberts.

As you have a command of the German language, you should read this German document:

http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/eula.pdf

dealings with "The EULA Fraud and How to Get a Legal Remedy".

Since e.g. the German Fontshop (www.fontshop.de) claims that fonts are "computer programs" ("software") and sells "licences" to such claimed "computer programs", you may do the following:

Insert the name of the desired font into the German-language affidavit form on page 5 of the above document eula.pdf and send it to Fontshop in Germany for signing this written affidavit concerning the desired font.

If Fontshop refuses to sign the affidavit, you know that Fontshop falsely claims that fonts are "computer programs" and that Fontshop "sells licences" to non-existing copyrights.

It is evident that you cannot grant a copyright licence to something that is not copyrighted, as everyone understands who is "sane in the brain".

If Fontshop refuses to sign the affidavit, you know that the desired font is not copyrighted, and therefore you can do with this font whatever you want to do, as far as the <strong>copyright law</strong> is concerned.

This means that all this does not apply to fonts as far as the <strong>design law</strong> is concerned and which have been validly registered as designs as mentioned above in this thread, because the valid registration as font design protects all forms of the font, even font computer files which are no computer programs. It should be noted, however, that most registered font designs are invalid, because most font designs do not meet the requirements of novelty and individuality (see e.g. the Segoe-Frutiger lawsuit).

Dear Uli, I know that it isn’t up to you to justify this never ending European Union Regulations nonsense. Once again we are discussing about a »curvature of a cucumber« EC Regulation.

Refering to the Microsoft vs. Linotype (Segoe / Frutiger Next) case:

How can an EC Regulation determine that »similar« is »identical«. 

Furthermore, if similar is identical; - how can a judge establish the criteria what is similar or identical in case of a typeface?

Perhaps a stupid example: I suppose everybody knows »Marilyn«, an artwork of Andy Warhol. My question: Is Marilyn 1 similar to Marilyn 2 or 3 or 4 …….. . If they are similar, they are identical (in the opinion of the EU). That means buying Marilyn 1 I bought even Marylin 2, 3, 4, etc. because they are identical. - »Good night Europe«

Another example: Personally I’m »forging« fleurons, ornaments etc. from old »Foundry Specimen Books«. Actually I’m »forging« calligraphic ornaments from Richard Gans Foundry, Madrid. If you look at this [[http://www.typoatelier.com/muster/RGans.jpg|example]] from a Gans Specimen Book from 1922 you will note, that the ornaments are similar but not identical. Why should Gans map those similar ornaments in his specimen if they are identical? Because of their different size? -I don’t think so.     

An additional point: It seems that no one in the EU knows the difference between a typeface and a font file. It’s the same difference as between a vector graphic and a .svg file. The graphic is artwork the .svg file is markup or better: code. And code is software.-At least in my humble opinion.

Da Sie Österreicher sind, zitiere ich das österreichische Urhebergesetz:
<cite>
§ 2. Werke der Literatur im Sinne dieses Gesetzes sind: 1. Sprachwerke aller Art einschließlich Computerprogrammen (§ 40a);
...
§ 40a. (1) Computerprogramme sind Werke im Sinn dieses Gesetzes, wenn sie das Ergebnis der eigenen geistigen Schöpfung ihres Urhebers sind.
</cite>
Damit gelten meine urheberrechtlichen Erläuterungen

http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/computerprogramm.pdf

auch für Österreich.

Verwenden Sie bitte nicht das unklare Wort "Software", denn das österreichische Urhebergesetz spricht von "Computerprogramm", nicht von "Software". (Das amerikanische Urhebergesetz spricht übrigens auch nicht von "software", sondern nur von "computer program".)

Umstritten ist beispielsweise, ob die Hints von PS und OTF fonts als Computerprogramm einzustufen sind. Aber selbst, wenn man sie als solche einstuft, scheitert die Schutzfähigkeit derselben daran, daß sie <strong>nicht</strong> "das Ergebnis der <strong>eigenen</strong> geistigen Schöpfung ihres Urhebers sind".

Wenn man z.B. Adobe-AFDKO startet und dann

   autohint -a AGaramondPro-Regular.otf

eingibt, wird dieser OTF-Font automatisch gehintet. Aber diese Befehlzeile ist keine "eigene geistige Schöpfung ihres Urhebers", und folglich sind die Hints bei sämtlichen Adobe-Fonts nicht urheberrechtlich geschützt, weil sie allesamt automatisch generiert wurden.

		<div class="commentbody">> argumentative bullschtt

In order to prove that EULAs are "argumentative bullschtt" designed to deceive gullible font buyers, I sent various font orders to managers and lawyers of various font houses requesting them to fill in the accompanied affidavit form: 

<strong>Affidavit:

This is to certify that __________, called "font software" in the EULA, is a computer program, i.e. a set of statements, as defined by the Copyright Law, that the source code of this set of statements was written by __________, and that this "font software" is protected by copyright.

I solemnly swear that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Signature of __________</strong>

None of the managers and none of the lawyers of font houses certified that the "font software" is protected by copyright.

This means that the font EULA is "argumentative bullschtt" drafted by lawyers for the purpose of deceiving dimwitted, gullible font buyers, who are expected to certify via EULA that fonts are protected by copyright, while the managers of font houses and their lawyers would never certify that fonts are protected by copyright.

Good pun.

For example, the Linotype lawyers request "certifiable" font buyers to certify this legal "bullschtt":

<cite>"3.2 The licensee agrees that the Font Software and documentation, and all copies thereof, are owned by Linotype GmbH; and its design, structure, organization and encoding are valuable property of Linotype GmbH and/or its suppliers. The licensee agrees that the Font Software and documentation are protected by German trademark and design patent laws, by the copyright and trademark laws of other countries, and by international treaties. In addition, the licensee agrees to treat the Font Software and documentation in the same manner corresponding to other copyrighted and trademark-protected products, e.g., books. With the exception of the points explicitly mentioned here, copying the Font Software and documentation is not permitted. Any and all copies that the licensee is permitted to produce on the basis of this agreement have to have to contain the same copyright, trademark and other property clauses as those on or contained in the Font Software and documentation. The licensee declares not to modify, adapt or translate the encoding of the Font Software, nor reproduce, decompile, disassemble, change, modify or otherwise attempt to reveal the source code of the Font Software."</cite>

But the Linotype lawyers would never certify this legal "bullschtt".</div>

No police or recourse will likely occur, unless there is substantial business being made.

Most designers and font makers make very little money with this kind of software. Such illegal action causes them to make even less.

In Orthodox Judaism, such illegal conduct has brought respondsa from leading Rabbinic authorities prohibiting explicitly this action. As a result, ones share in the world to come is jeopardized. Imagine for a $25 to $50 cost, the resulting transgression may cause a person to forego "heaven" and receive instead time in "hell".</div>

Depends on the translation. The twelfth ecumenical council passed a retroactive ruling that effectively removed all mentions of StoneSans, making any further (or prior) references to it tantamount to heresy.

How come that neither Jan Kaestner as the "European Legal Counsel" nor Frank Wildenberg as the "General Manager" of the Linotype GmbH had the courage to certify what they expect font buyers to certify by way of EULA? The answer is quite simple: If Jan Kaestner and Frank Wildenberg certified that the fonts sold by Linotype and Monotype are copyright, they would commit the crime of false affidavit, and therefore they are frightened to make the false statement that the fonts they sell are copyright.

That's what's done by the major font sellers. Most font designers receive no royalties at all for the fonts sold by Linotype, Monotype, Berthold, etc. If fonts were copyrightable, then even decades after the designers's death, their heirs could claim royalties. But neither Max Miedinger nor his heirs receive royalties from Linotype for the sale of Helvetica. This means that Linotype, Monotype, Berthold, etc. <cite>"take the fruit of another's labor without remuneration"</cite>, as you put it. There are exceptions to this rule (Adrian Frutiger, Hermann Zapf, etc.), but for more the majority of fonts sold by Linotype, Monotype, Berthold, etc., this rule is valid.</div>

The short answer to your question is, yes.

Using stolen property, transporting stolen property, or passing on stolen property is against the law. Like any lawbreaker, sometimes you get caught, sometimes you don't.

There might be other explanations, no!? Most font designers receive no royalties for fonts sold by Linotype, Monotype or Berthold, because the designers sold the copy rights to the ownership of one of those companies. Max Miedinger's Helvetica is among them, and some Frutiger and Zapf faces are paid up while others are royalty earning. Those companies control the copyrights because they paid for the work, and if you have not heard from their lawyers it is likely because they are not paid to educate you in Type Legalities 101 unless it pays.

So, if some font is copyright, use of it without permission from or payment to its owner is in deed illegal.

Nothing, however, will happen. If you stubb your toe as a result, do tell me, as I have connections. G-d is pretty forgiving.

Adobe did win some lawsuits, so there are legal precedents on the books. But that was for big business.

In the end, you can get away with most illegal use. The only one who gets screwed is the poor type designer and his staving family. If you can live with that, breaking the law becomes a non-issue.</div>

> There might be other explanations, no!?

Whenever I read EULAs, I almost begin to vomit. But when I really start to vomit is when I read letters by foundries sent to their own font designers.

As my website on this funny industry (www.sanskritweb.net/forgers.htm) has been up and running for more than four years, I came into contact with many people, e.g. with many font designers, who have been taken for a ride by foundries.

I received numerous photostat copies of shysters's letters, which would make any human being start to vomit.

These shysters, on the one had, have concocted bizarre EULAs making the stupid font customers of foundries believe that fonts are copyright.

These same shysters, on the other hand, when the font designers of these foundries, many months after having supplied their font designs, ask for the royalties stipulated by contract, these same shysters send out letters to the font designers explaining them, that it is well known in the font industry that fonts are NOT copyright and that any intelligent font designer ought to know this legal fact and that therefore font designers cannot claim any copyright royalties at all.

That's why I said that the majority of font designers never receive royalties for the fonts sold by Linotype, Monotype, Berthold, etc. As I said above, there are exceptions to this rule. But a few larks do not make spring, do they?</div>

I cannot blow down this "house of cards". I only describe this industry, so that anyone can form one's own opinion. I have never been affiliated with anybody in this industry, so that I can supply an impartial description of this funny industry.

If I were allowed to publish the above-mentioned shysters' letters, many Typophilers would understand, why I said at my website that this funny industry is the scum of typography.

It is my opinion that any work should get its adequate remuneration, and this also applies to designers of fonts. However, the price of a commodity or service is determined by supply and demand, and for Latin fonts, there is more supply than demand.

There are font designers, who make custom-made fonts for certain companies or organisations. This is a business model for font makers.

Another business model is sponsoring. For instance, I sponsored the making of Sanskrit fonts by paying the equivalent of ordinary salaries to designers in Eastern Europe. This was financially possible for me as a retiree, because the salaries in Eastern Europe are very low, as compared with Germany. These Sanskrit fonts are freely downloadable from my website by anyone. This sponsoring model means that the designers get paid by sponsors and that the users may download the fonts for free.

What's wrong? Well, for instance, the second section of your ShinnType EULA labeled "2. COPYRIGHT" is legally wrong. That's what is wrong.

If you were SELLING retail fonts, just like all other ordinary retailers do, who sell all kinds of goods, then there would be nothing wrong. But via your EULA you license non-existing copyrights, and that is wrong, because this is illegal (and by the way, this is also unethical).

For instance, you write in your EULA that your fonts are "font software" and that "as such they are protected by the copyright laws of many nations". For example, Germany does not belong to these "many nations", and therefore if you grant against payment of a licence fee a copyright licence to a German, he will NOT obtain a copyright licence, because you cannot grant a copyright licence to something that is not copyrighted. In Germany, we call this copyright fraud. That's what is wrong.

The only legal (and by the way also the only ethical) solution for your retail fonts would be that you skip the "copyright licence" EULA rubbish and that you really SELL your retail fonts, just like all other ordinary retailers in the world SELL retail goods.

If I give my milkshake away, I can no longer drink it. But if I purchase a digital font, I can give it away to everyone in the world—which is precisely what happens when people post digital files on their sites, as torrents, etc. There has to be some legal accountability for persons who pay for the font in terms of not redistributing them. The data is what is what needs to be protected. I don't know the ins and outs of this whole debate—I know there are plenty of threads here on this topic—but it doesn't seem justified to protect some kinds of digital data and not others. And the argument that font designers are not programmers is insufficient to not protect fonts. Filmmakers and musicians who produce artworks do not write the software that edits and encodes their data as digital files, but there is still protection for these kinds of works.

My conscience is clear.

The digital type industry operates on a licensing principle that most people--producers, marketers and purchasers--think is fair.
This slice of society determines what is ethically acceptable.

According to you, our industry is founded on a premise which is unethical in the larger scheme of society.
That's debatable, because society as a whole is still wrestling with the issue of how to legislate to protect the rights of digital content creators.

Since you are from Canada, I refer to your Canadian copyright law:

see http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/C-42///en

The above Canadian copyright act provides that "cinematographic works" and "musical works" and "artistic works" and "computer programs" etc. are protected by copyright. Hence filmmakers and musicians etc. obtain protection for these kinds of works.

But "fonts" do not belong to the kinds of works protected by the Canadian copyright act, and hence they are not copyrighted by the Canadian copyright act.

Since fonts are neither "artistic works" nor "computer programs", shysters invented the fairy tale that fonts are copyright as "software".

Look for the word "software" in your above Canadian copyright act, and you will find nothing. Got it?

I did find some mention on your site of this judgment, but you wrongly claim it is relevant only for Utopia. The court only ruled on that typeface, as they said Adobe only gave full evidence on that one. But the *principle* of the legitimacy of claims of copyright on fonts as software was established. 

They didn't rule on the other claims, but it is clear that if Adobe--or anybody else--supplied similar evidence of copying, they would likely get the same result.  

That established the principle, which you continue to deny indignantly and, it seems to me, absurdly.

In addition, most all the work we let out is 'licensed' not 'sold', we send all of our works to the copyright office for 'font software' registration and we mop the floor regularly, wash behind out ears and clip our nails neatly.

None were either offered or required for that work. 

"... and which copyright laws did you obey,..."
All of them, we broke no copyright laws. 

"...when you and Matthew Carter and Roger Black and Mike Parter ripped off one thousand fonts..."
You have been programmed incorrectly by bad anecdotal and personal information Mr. Black was never at the company or involved with the clients we served. Mr. Carter and Mr. Parker were officers and made offers to the owners for licensing of the trademarks involved to allow those trademarks to be used on machines other than those of the TM owners. Some licenses eventually were granted but most were refused. None of the work was light-table compatible, all included original kerning and scaling data among other things and they were sold as their own designs, not copies. 

"Did you send these ripped-off fonts as “our work” to the copyright office for registration?"
Yes. As original digital works derived from analog sources they were copyrightable and accepted as such to this day. 

I'm not sure if you have a track, but if you did, you've run off it. I hope you feel better, but would you like another EULA?

		<div class="commentbody">Mr. Berlow:

As regards the name of Roger Black, I regret that I made a memory error here, but I should emphasize that, four years ago, when I documented the Bitstream font forgeries (www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/bitstream2.pdf), I nowhere mention Roger Black as co-founder of the Bitstream font forging outfit in my documentations.

<cite>"they were sold as their own designs, not copies"</cite>

In my document www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/publicdomain.pdf, which was published in 2008, I documented the Linotype typeface catalog of the year 1982 listing the fonts, the designs of which were public domain in 2008, i.e. 25 years later. However, when the Bitstream font forging outfit was founded by Matthew Carter, Mike Parker and David Berlow two decades ago, many of these font designs were NOT YET in public domain. Therefore the Bitstream font forging outfit could not sell these ripped-off designs <cite>"as their own designs"</cite>, as Mr. Berlow claims. The Frutiger-Segoe-case made it clear that <cite>"Designs shall be deemed to be identical if their features differ only in immaterial details"</cite> (see the Segoe lawsuit documents at my website). But even in the case of those font designs, which were already in public domain at the time, when the Bitstream font forging outfit was founded, the forgers who founded this outfit, could not declare these public domain designs <cite>"as their own designs"</cite>. "Passing off" the designs made by others as one's own designs and selling these "passed off" designs as one's own designs is equivalent to the crime of fraud. Example: Neither Matthew Carter nor Mike Parker nor David Berlow are the designers of the typeface "Frutiger", and therefore it was illegal that they "passed off" Frutiger's design as their own design as "Humanist 777".

		<div class="commentbody">"That’s one funky new icon, there, David!"
It's one of them fancy medical scans of my brain I done mice elf with my iPhone.

"...was founded by Matthew Carter, Mike Parker and David Berlow two decades ago,.."
I worked for Linotype when Bitstream was founded and for sometime after Bitstream's founding (28! years ago). I couldn't join the company until Bitstream almost had an interactive digital letter drawing machine, and it took a few more months after that to establish a reliable "save" button.

"...many of these font designs were NOT YET in public domain. "
Very few fonts, and none in the Linotype catalog you cite, are "designs" in 'Private Domain" as established by law at the time. See leonard storch enterprises inc. v. mergenthaler linotype co. for that landmark in the legal process and the watershed in Linotype's font development funding vs. their future inability to grasp and control their own future.

"The Frutiger-Segoe-case..."
How long is the gap between the events you are describing, and the case you are citing?

"“Designs shall be deemed to be identical if their features differ only in immaterial details”"
That's very nice, and I like it! So, the fonts made that share the metrics, color and ratio-to-Em of someone else's face would today be deemed "to be identical", whatever that means legally locally. And if not, i.e. if differences in material details conspire to give even a slightly different appearance, Not.

"... David Berlow [is not] the designer[] of the typeface “Frutiger”
You're getting warm, (though not even Frutiger himself put it this way).

"therefore it was illegal [to] “pass[] off” “Humanist 777” [] as [his] own design[]."
Nobody at Bitstream said any of the designs you cite were ours. The typefaces were always credited as inspired by the originals, by the originator (and the originator sometimes helped us for a fee). Attempts at licensing the names were constantly in motion. 

Overall, I think that you have to re-appreciate or learn from scratch, the context of a time when the setting of fonts occurred over a wide spectrum of devices, each requiring its own font format, detailed for output and constraints, through which typography and aesthetics had to be carried via an equally perplexing array of composition devices, to a public utterly oblivious to fonts before they saw them. And then, you have imagine the whole thing melting to the point where the company most responsible for trying to utterly change things in typographic IP, Adobe, teamed up with the company that had utterly been trying to keep them the same, Linotype. Then, fast forward to a time where everybody and their mom know about fontz — and some, by cherry-picking through details of vast and small topics ranging from jots and tittles to IP history may choose to present their own isolated little fiction in ignorance of the most basic facts. Can you?

What a childish retort. We're talking about us, here. You and me. Not the major sellers. Other people rob banks, too, but that doesn't make it OK for me to. My argument stands: appropriation of another's intellectual property without paying for it is theft, and if you can live with yourself, fine; just don't ever expect to be paid for your own hard work, and don't expect much in the way of karma. Defending yourself with "but xxx did it first!" is ignorant, childish, and - please don't take this personally - stupid in the extreme.

The proverb says: "Who lives in a glass house, should not throw stones."

As opposed to Matthew Carter, Mike Parker and David Berlow, I have never cloned the fonts designed by others and sold under fancy names such as "Humanist 777" etc. My humanistic education does not approve of such behaviour.

Jacqueline D. Lipton's above-mentioned treatise on the font industry should be studied by all those who think that they are as clever as Mr. Berlow.

Lipton, who regards the font industry as an "IP-negative space", constantly uses the conditional word "if": <cite>"If such an extension is to be made, copyrights granted for digital typefaces should only be thin."</cite>.</div>

I should like to mention that Professor Lipton asked me to cite the documents at my "Font Forging Industry" website in the next draft of her paper, to which I agreed with pleasure.

Her treatise mainly writes <strong>"de lege ferenda"</strong>, i.e. about whether any <strong>future</strong> US Copyright Law should accord copyright to typefaces at all, or only "thin copyright" (similar to "kleine Münze" in German copyright law). In this regard, the documents at my website are of greatest importance.

For instance, I documented at my site that the main business philosophy of Bitstream founded in the 1980s was to clone the fonts designed by others and sell them under fancy names. From the point of view of any future US Copyright Law, the question "de lege ferenda" is whether font forging companies with such a business philosophy should be granted at all the monopolistic privilege of copyright protection for typefaces.

2)

> <cite>@Uli: you have asked individuals to sign an affidavit certifying a legal opinion, not facts. They can’t. At most they could say: “I believe that etc”, but they couldn’t certify what you ask for.</cite>

That's correct. But the above English affidavit wording is only an "ad hoc" English wording made for this Typophile thread. I did not send this English-language affidavit to foreign font forging companies. Instead I sent German-language affidavits to (1) German font companies (and also to their German lawyers) and (2) to German subsidiaries and German outlets of foreign font companies (and also to their German lawyers).

Yet, the above English affidavit does not consist only of "I legally believe" statements. For instance, the most important statement whether or not the "source code" of a given font exists at all, and if so, by which person was this source code written, is not a "legal opinion". Please note that Linotype etc. request customers to sign via EULA that "source code" <strong>exists</strong>, but Linotype etc. and their lawyers, if asked by font customers, refuse to declare that "source code" exists at all, let alone who wrote the imaginary "source code".

		<div class="commentbody">I've read what's been written by J. D. Lipton, and I am neither impressed with the facts presented, there's nothing new, nor the way it was presented, being poorly word crafted, composed and sprinkled, as I never try to read, with spelling and grammatical errors.  (does everyone else get a Courier Italic word in the middle of a Times Italic sentence on every page?). Probably the greatest gap in her understanding of the situation, one that Uli shares like a blanket, is "why?" Why did the the cases she cites and events she superficially chronicles — why did they happen, then?

"...a larger group of market participants who have spent less time in the industry – and are perhaps only engaging in it as a hobby rather than a profession – may have less stake in identifying and conforming to existing norms."

And she's right there with them...to say the least. 

Uli attempting a quote of Lipton: “If such an extension is to be made, copyrights granted for digital typefaces should only be thin.”

She is talking about the design! Not the underlying font-drawing software that describes the design! Pay attention! The industry has re-normalized around the following: the software is protected by copyright, the name by trademark and the design by open licensing. 

The software is protected by copyright so that it cannot be effortlessly duplicated as someone else's. The name is trademarked so that it may not be stolen, and it can not be applied to a similar or identical design published via different font software. The licensing is open so one does not need to choose ones publishing environment by the fonts one licenses, or ones fonts by ones publishing environment. 

"As opposed to Matthew Carter, Mike Parker and David Berlow, I have never cloned the fonts" lol, Show me proof that any of the people you're slandering have cloned fonts? lol, Prove you never have cloned fonts. Just because you have chosen a tiny niche font development, like Sanskrit for Germans today, (Thai for Eskimos tomorrow?), does it give you a superior world view to the vast market of more immediate and important needs?

Your facts and figures are wrong, and your interpretation of them is wronger still. You, by your own admission, "have never been affiliated with anybody in this industry", so that you can supply an impartial description of this industry? How does that work? Like a blind interior decorator is not polluted by having seen anyone else's work can do the best job? More like you, and the eager-beaver lawyers of the world will be set for life chasing phantoms.

I do not expect that you listen to me as someone, who has never worked in this funny font forging industry, and I do not expect that you listen to Professor Lipton or any other law professors. But I wonder, why you do not even listen to your friends and colleagues. For instance, Mr. John Hudson, who respects you, nevertheless came to the conclusion that you and Parker and Carter cloned <cite>"the entire Linotype library"</cite>. Mr. Hudson wrote this:

<cite>"Which brings us to Bitstream. It is very difficult to criticise Bitstream's initial programme without implicating individuals who both previously and since have contributed so much of value to type development – namely Matthew Carter, Mike Parker and David Berlow. I have immense respect for all of these people, and am pleased to be personal friends with Mike, but to pretend that their hands are entirely clean is futile. There are, perhaps, mitigating factors in Bitstream's decision to produce copies of the entire Linotype library, and to market them under peculiar names. New type technologies were emerging and were ripe for exploitation; Bitstream essentially invented the idea of device independent type; all three principals of Bitstream had formerly worked at Linotype, and clearly anticipated being able to legitimately license the fonts they wanted; Bitstream made attempts to license the fonts, but were refused by Linotype who opted instead to license to Adobe. I leave it to others to add to, correct or detract from these factors. The fact remains that, refused licenses by Linotype, Bitstream proceeded to copy the fonts anyway."</cite>

According to your biography (www.fontbureau.com/people/DavidBerlow), you have been working for seven years at the Bitstream outfit from 1982 until 1989. While Carter during his Bitstream period also made a few own fonts not copied from others, your only task during your seven-year period at the Bitstream font forging outfit seems to have been <cite>"to produce copies of the entire Linotype library"</cite> (John Hudson).

I should like to mention that there are others here at the Typophile site, e.g. Mr. Adam Twardoch, who have described the Bitstream story in similar words just like Mr. John Hudson.

		<div class="commentbody">Since Mr. David Berlow claims that the fonts sold by Font Bureau are "font software" and since he claims that <cite>"we send all of our works to the copyright office for ’font software’ registration"</cite>, I had a closer look at one of the fonts, namely at the font "Benton Sans".

At the Font Bureau website (see www.fontbureau.com/cart/license/single) we read in the <cite>"Font Software License Agreement"</cite> that the "licensee" is requested to sign that the author of the "font software", here for example the author of  "Benton Sans", has written the "source code" of this so-called "font software" and that therefore the <cite>"Licensee agrees not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble"</cite> this so-called "font software".

By studying the internals of "Benton Sans", I came to the conclusion that no human being ever wrote any source code to this so-called "font software".

Incidentally, the hinting of the font is virtually non-existent (at least the font version which I examined and which has the internal font number 2000956):

By listening to this and your other conclusions, I've come to other conclusions.

"... therefore the “Licensee agrees not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble” this so-called “font software”
Really? That is not what anyone else has read, Ever. It actually says we have rights and are the owners of those rights according to the law here, where it was published. Then, separately, it says by licensing this software, (regardless of what may or may not be legal in you country), licensee agrees not to...Got vomit?

"Incidentally, the hinting of the font is virtually non-existent..."
Is it illegal to download illegally uploaded fonts? And is it illegal to use them?

Maybe you are needing to de-stress your mind by upgrading to antialiasing font software. I have not seen such crap rendering since before 1990.

The "crap rendering" stems from your Benton Sans of 2003, which was not hinted at all, while the version of 2008 (as used in the type specimen file BentonSans.pdf at your Font Bureau website) is hinted indeed.

When a real professional, for instance someone like Juri Yarmola, who is both a programming expert and a font expert, compares the internals of any letter from the version of 2003 with the internals of the corresponding letter from the version of 2008, for instance these two letter internals

2003: 68 CC B9 B7 76 D9 80 8B 05 E0 17 9B FD C3 47 EB 1F F2 2F E4 6D 79 15 31 91

2008: 68 CC B9 B7 76 D9 80 8B 68 11 BD BC BC D3 47 18 2C 5B 2E B4 6F C0 35 E7 2F 78 EA 93 34 4B 26 29 08 F5 E9 66

then he will recognize at once that nobody wrote the "source code" of the so-called "font software", because completely different drawing sequences had been generated fully automatically by two completely different font generating programs in 2003 and 2008. Neither Tobias Frere-Jones nor Cyrus Highsmith, who have been declared by Mr. David Berlow at his website to be the designers alias "programmers" of the design alias "program" of Benton Sans alias News Gothic, would have been able to write the "source code" for these completely different drawing sequences.

Yes I do. Fee phishing is an ugly business. And legal fee phishing is a really ugly business. 

You know?
"For example, font designers who do not actually write code, but who use programs such as Adobe Illustrator to assist them in developing code, may not be creating original code in the sense required by copyright law. Their efforts are not in the code-writing area. The code production is merely incidental to the generation of their font designs."

" ...may not be..." being the phishing lure used here. By the time this working paper is complete, I expect each and every paragraph to lead to a fee. The typing of code itself is not the entire process of digital type, movie, web or musical authoring. 
Go on, I dare you.

I think that digressions to "phishing fees" etc. are not helpful.

Above in this thread, Mr. Berlow wrote:

<cite>"... we send all of our works to the copyright office for ’font software’ registration ..."</cite>

So, the only important and only decisive question is this:

Is that which was sent by Mr. Berlow a copyrightable work?

I am sure that he did not send "source code" to the copyright office, because there exists no "source code" for the so-called "font software" Benton Sans, since nobody wrote source code for Benton Sans.

Did Mr. Berlow send a hexadecimal dump of the font file?

see http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/SourceCode.gif

But neither a font file nor its hex dump are "font software".

Real font software, which is really copyrightable, is this:

For instance, all editors for the making of fonts are real font software, e.g. Font Lab, Fontographer, Font Forge, Type Designer, Font Creator, etc. etc.

Furthermore, the components of the operating systems (Win, Mac etc.) which display the letters on CRT or TFT monitors, are real font software. In case of MS Windows, it is the GDI that is font software. The Windows GDI generates the contours of the glyphs on the computer screen on the basis of the x-y-coordinates of the contours of the letters contained in the font files. But the GDI is a component of the MS Windows operating system and not a component of the "Benton Sans" font file. The "Benton Sans" font file only contains the contours of letters and does not contain the software required for displaying these contours on the screen. Hence the font "Benton Sans" cannot be registered as "font software" at the copyright office.</div>

At the US Copyright Office nobody examines, whether that which you submit for registration is copyrightable or not, so that Font Bureau could also register the non-program "Benson Sans" as a "computer program":

see http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/Registration.jpg

It is a funny joke, that Font Bureau stated Fontographer as "preexisting material". Even if they had stated Microsoft's GDI or Adobe's Type Manager as "preexisting material", the officers at the US Copyright Office would not have objected. In this funny font forging industry, it is easy to take even the officers at the US Copyright Office for a ride.</div>

But the one ruling on this issue, Adobe vs SSI, decides that such sets of numbers are software. You don't have to like it, but that is the legal precedent. So long as you fail to address that reality, you will convince nobody.  </div>

It's unfortunate for type designers, but most people don't understand that type design is not just about making attractive-looking letters, but concerns the visual mechanics of how letters fit with one another. Of course, if one looks at letters individually, they don't appear to have much originality--but the same could be said of the components of music or literature. The way type design is treated, it's like the only novel that could be copyright protected would be entirely composed of neologisms, or shizzolated, which would be the equivalent of the gimmick fonts shown in the Lipton tract.</div>

...

When a real professional, for instance someone like Juri Yarmola, who is both a programming expert and a font expert, compares the internals of any letter from the version of 2003 with the internals of the corresponding letter from the version of 2008, for instance these two letter internals

2003: 68 CC B9 B7 76 D9 80 8B 05 E0 17 9B FD C3 47 EB 1F F2 2F E4 6D 79 15 31 91

2008: 68 CC B9 B7 76 D9 80 8B 68 11 BD BC BC D3 47 18 2C 5B 2E B4 6F C0 35 E7 2F 78 EA 93 34 4B 26 29 08 F5 E9 66

then he will recognize at once that nobody wrote the “source code” of the so-called “font software”, because completely different drawing sequences had been generated fully automatically by two completely different font generating programs in 2003 and 2008.</em>

Nowadays, it is possible to produce "computer-generated works" instead of writing works "by hand".

see www.law.duke.edu/journals/dltr/articles/2001dltr0024.html

A typical example of computer-generated works is the conversion of fonts from one format to another. Let's assume, you have 1000 fonts in PostScript format, which you want to convert to TrueType fonts. If you use a converter (e.g. TransType, see www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype), your only own "creative" activity will consist in clicking on the folder, so that the converter knows the fonts you want to convert. Then, it generates fully automatically 1000 TrueType fonts as computer-generated works.

Do you think you have become the author of 1000 copyrightable works?

<strong>This Being is Nothingness!</strong>

Copyright protection is only granted to authors of intellectual works. Copyright law rewards the creative intellectual activity of authors. A work of authorship is a work created by the own intellect of the autor. If a person does not exercise his own intellect, he cannot be the author of an intellectual work and hence cannot be granted copyright protection.

Here is a fictitious example, which is easier to understand than the above font conversion example:

At the website of Mr. Ricardo Cordoba, who uploaded above "Twilight Zone" picture, we learn that he learnt the English and the Spanish language so that he has the intellectual ability to create works of authorship in English and Spanish. But Mr. Cordoba did not learn the French and the German language, so that he does not have the intellectual ability to create works of authorship in French and German.

Now let's assume there is a copyright lawsuit, and Mr. Cordoba as a defendant states that he translated Sartre's French work "L'être et le néant"

www.amazon.fr/LEtre-N%C3%A9ant-Jean-Paul-Sartre/dp/2070293882
(For English see www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Nothingness)

into the German language. The judge asks whether Mr. Cordoba can read and write French and German books, which is denied by Mr. Cordoba, who claims that no knowledge of languages is require for copyright protection, because he bought a computer translation program which made a fully automatic translation of the electronic file of the French work "L'être et le néant" into the German language so that he is the author of the German translation "Das Sein und das Nichts" as a derivative work of copyright.

Is this correct?

Who does not exercise his own intellect cannot be the author of intellectual works and therefore cannot be granted protection by the copyright law.

Another example: Mr. Thomas Phinney and Mr. Miguel Sousa repeatedly stated here and elsewhere that all Adobe PostScript and OpenType fonts are fully automatically hinted by entering a simple command line such as

autohint -a AGaramondPro-Regular.otf

Irrespective of whether hints of PostScript fonts are regarded as computer programs or not, they are generated fully automatically so that he who enters above command line does not need to have any intellectual ability whatsoever except the ability to enter the command line. But he who does not exercise his own intellect cannot be the author of intellectual works so that nobody can be granted protection by the copyright law for automatically generated hints of PostScript fonts.

		<div class="commentbody">Mr. Nick Shinn:

> <cite>This is a moot point. Many fonts with OpenType features have “proper” code written by the type designer, e.g.

lookup smcp_latn1 {
sub @smcp_latn1 by @smcp_latn2;
sub @figs_numr by @figs_sups;
sub @figs_dnom by @figs_sinf;
} smcp_latn1;</cite>

I consulted the OpenType font format specifications here:

http://www.microsoft.com/Typography/otspec/chapter2.htm

If I understand these OpenType specifications correctly, then GSUB definitions, which at first glance look, as if they were the source code of an executable computer program, are not compiled into an executable program, but instead a non-executable lookup data table is generated on the basis of this pseudo code. If my assumption is correct, then OpenType features are not computer programs, but only binary data, i.e. binary lookup tables. But those who are more familiar with the internal structure of OpenType features may correct me.

PS: In the above chapter2.htm, the word "program" is used nowhere, and the word "code" is used in this chapter only in the sense of Unicode, character code etc.</div>

So i.e. databases or libraries are to be considered software as well, although you would need a 'program' to produce any kind of result out of them. In this respect digital font files should be considered software as well.

Further, I find it hard to belief that digital font files that have not manually been written bite by bite can not be copyrighted.
This would mean that one also can not claim copyright for jpg files exported from Photoshop or pdf files exported from a lay-out application.

For you in the Netherlands, all creative "works of art", whether drawn or painted, whether a picture on paper or a picture file (jpg, tif, bmp etc.), are protected by copyright law, but you cannot claim a <strong>separate</strong> copyright for a jpg file of a painting. But since paintings in whatever physical form are copyright as "works of art", why do need a separate copyright for jpg files?

By the way, in the German Nazi era, a few "Nazi" typefaces had been regarded by the third "Reich" supreme court as "works of art". Some of these "works of art" ("kunstwerk" in German and Dutch language) are depicted here:

No, it's not illegal to download illegally uploaded fonts. However it would be "illegal" to use them. So what's the point in d/l-ing them in the first place then??*

[Though if I understand it correctly, _technically_ it wouldn't even be illegal to use them, merely not rightful.

Moreover, the creator of this thread asked if downloading and using is illegal, not if it offends anyone's conscience.

If you've followed the discussion here, you should have understood that there is nothing to prevent downloading of the fonts (certainly not in Canada) and that the legality of use is determined by the type of use, and not by the manner the fonts were acquired. Creators have rights, and so do users.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm afraid you have it all wrong, Ricardo. Suppose you open a business and do well. Suppose I open a competing business across the street and take away some of your business. I caused you economic harm. I may even took advantage of your efforts, since some of my clients only became aware of my business by coming to you first.

Yet, the fact that I caused you economic harm doesn't mean I took away your property. Your profits are not legally protected (unless I violated some other right of yours, e.g., your trade-mark, or by "passing-off").

The term "intellectual property" misleads you into believing that your economic interests are protected beyond the scope of copyright, trade-mark, unfair competition, and other recognized categories of law. The right to exclusive profit from your creative work is not a natural right, but one that requires legislation.

If you fix your creative efforts in a physical medium, your property rights in the tangible are protected. In addition, the law prohibits others from unauthorized copying, unless it is for a permitted use (e.g., private study). But you cannot claim more than that. 

Yes, some creators deserve better, but it is not possible to build a theory of property rights based on stomping one's foot and yelling, "unfair!". </div>

I'm quite aware of this; thanks anyway. However, the law is what permits society to exist -- it's an agreement or a contract. I could go set fire to my neighbor's house, but I don't. Not only because it's against the law, but because I would feel bad if I did it. It would just be wrong, period.

Huh? I could not be further away from Wall Street in any terms, yet I rely on the copyright protection to derive my (meagre) income from my font's sales.

There is a fundamental flaw in your post, which you may refuse to acknowledge, but that's ok, since the law is the law no matter what you or I think, and the flaw is this: a licensed use is lawful, but an unlicensed use is not necessarily unlawful, since the law gives users rights, too. So, a creator might say, I don't allow my work to be used by X for purpose Y, and the law would answer that the creator's permission is not required. The fact that copyright exists in fonts, in countries where it does exist, does not mean that the rights of the copyright holder are unlimited, but that the font is property to the extent the statute says so and no more. If that is not clear to you, I can refer you to some good sources from Australia and other common law jurisdictions.</div>

There is, unfortunately, also a fundamental flaw in your own post. For you as a professor of law, you should be able to  supply more than unhelpful, tautological statements such as this one: <cite>"copyright exists in fonts, in countries where it does"</cite>.

In my first post to this long thread I said:

<strong>"Even Chief Justice Roberts ... would never swear that fonts are computer programs ...  No sane person believes this rubbish, let alone the American Chief Justice Roberts"</strong>

If you, as a professor of law, want to be really helpful, then specify a country (at least <strong>one</strong> country), where a person acting as was described here (www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/publicdomain.pdf, pages 2), is at this very moment a "computer programmer", who has just written a TrueType "computer program".</div>

Fonts may or may not be computer programs under various other definitions of "computer program," and that's an entertaining philosophical question, but those definitions are pretty much irrelevant to the situation under discussion.

I would be willing to bet $1000 USD with you, Uli, that if the question ever reaches the US Supreme Court, and the definition they are using has not changed, they will indeed hold that outline fonts  are computer programs, and that whoever the Chief Justice is, he won't disagree with that point.

However, much as I would love to see it happen, I sincerely doubt that any such case will be considered and decided on by the US Supreme Court in my lifetime.

The word "tautological" (= tautologous") is defined by Merrian-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary as <cite>"true by virtue of its logical form alone"</cite>.

In your unhelpful, tautological sentence:

“The fact that copyright exists in <strong>fonts</strong>, in countries where it does exist, does not mean that the rights of the copyright holder are unlimited, but that the <strong>font</strong> is property to the extent the statute says so and no more.”

the word "font" may be replaced by any other, e.g. by "negro":

“The fact that copyright exists in <strong>negroes</strong>, in countries where it does exist, does not mean that the rights of the copyright holder are unlimited, but that the <strong>negro</strong> is property to the extent the statute says so and no more.”

and your sentence will still be <cite>"true by virtue of its logical form alone"</cite>.

If you want to be helpful, then specify a country, where a person acting as described here (www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/publicdomain.pdf, pages 2), is at this very moment a “computer programmer”, who has just written a TrueType “computer program”.</div>

Look at this excerpt scanned from a math book:

see www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/control_points.jpg

It shows many "control points", both as a table and as a graph.

But who would say that this is a "computer program"?

In a font file, "control points" are nothing but sequences of numbers:

see www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/computerprogramm.pdf (page 2 seq.)

If someone writes down the numbers from 1 to 100000:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ...  99998, 99999, 100000

or any other arbitrary sequence of numbers, e.g.:

... -10736, -5438, -2227, 0, 9358, 17559, 93457 ...

all this "takes effort to produce", that's sure.

But a sequence of numbers is not copyrightable.</div>

Anybody who has read the relevant definition of "computer program" would say so.

For at least the second time in this thread: "A “computer program” is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result." So says the US Copyright Office document "Copyright Registration for Computer Programs," in its very first sentence, entitled "definition." http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ61.pdf

Now, one could reasonably argue that the US Copyright Office has a bad definition of "computer program." But to argue that under the current law and policies of the copyright office, fonts are not computer programs... that's just silly.

Plus, we need a moderator to clean up Uli's post (again). Some people just don't listen.

Cheers,

The problem with tautology is that the logic is indisputable, yet the sentence conveys no useful content. My sentence did not fall into that category, because its purpose wasn't to comment about whether copyright does or does not exist in fonts, but to distinguish the type of proprietary protection capable of existing in fonts as opposed to tangible property. The sentence was a response to a comment made by another poster, who suggested they should be identical. If my point is valid (and I believe it is), then it goes to explain my reply to the topic of the thread: whether downloading and use of material posted illegally is permissible. Your "rebuke" was not therefore not only uncalled for, but also irrelevant. It is the product of your singular fixation with one aspect of the controversy to the exclusion of all others. I wish your own comments could be more helpful to this discussion.</div>

If that's the case, that's yet another reason for copyright reform. Whether something is copyrightable or not should be resistant to encoding changes. If I choose to write poetry using decimal ASCII values, that alone shouldn't prevent my poems from being copyrightable.

Decades ago I, and others I knew, wrote the occasional computer program directly in machine code (by that I mean entering the numeric codes directly rather using an assembler). This was practical given the machine architecture of the CPUs of that day. Should these programs, by dint of their construction, be unprotected by copyright?

Herein lies the rub. Control points have even more structure than being mere coordinates. But by imposing this additional structure (that of being control points for a certain class of outline curve), they move further away from being programs.</div>

Tupper, if you read some of the above you will see that the US courts have ruled that fonts are software, and can be protected as such. 

As to what are not programs, that's a good question. I would say an example are non-executuable text files, such as these you are reading.

Berkson, not all of us are under the jurisdiction of US courts.

You seem to be conflating software and programs. Are you?

Please note that copyright as applied to computer programs does not directly involve the relationship it effects between input and output. One person can write a program that behaves, from a non-programmer's perspective, identically to another without running afoul of copyright law (at least as regards to the source codes of the two programs). Is this the sort of "protection" you want for fonts?

My earlier comments were not on entire font files, but on control points and kerning data. While I don't see these (control points and kerning data) as computer programs, I do see these as valuable and that we, as a society, should encourage work on them.

<em>As to what are not programs, that’s a good question. I would say an example are non-executuable text files, such as these you are reading.</em>

Why? ~~The use of those numbers (in this case, numbers representing text) brings about a result-in this case, the presentation of the text on the screen.~~ (I don't see it that way, I'm just not sure why control points are so different...)

For a programming language to be universally accepted as a programming language by the relevant experts, it would need to have at least a hint of general computation. (Just how low in the complexity hierarchy one would need to hint at could be argued, but the complexity involved in rendering the low-degree curves currently used in fonts would be far too low for universal agreement.)

<em>I don’t know if the court discussed that, but it seems to me that text files or data files have value from their meaning, whereas fonts are digital tools, which only create value when they are used as part of programs designed to produce the end result: type on the screen or on paper.</em>

Well, the source code of many computer programs have definite value unrelated to whatever output they may produce when executed on a computer.

as for "learning to respect and value the work" you do,
do you think your work is any different from the digital
product produced by creative artists across the board?

the advice i gave you is firmly and directly on-point...

it's also the same advice i give to other digital artists.

because, just like every other artist whose product is
digital, your work can easily be copied freely by people.

and because of that, it _will_ be copied freely and easily.
(if it's any good, that is.)

now, you can go on and on and on and on about how
"that's illegal", but guess what?, that is no deterrent...

you might as well tell people that it's illegal to disobey
the speed limit.  guess what?  you're wasting your time.
people are going to disobey the speed limit...  and they
are going to copy your work freely and easily.  accept it.
because there's _nothing_ you can do to stop 'em.  nada.

first of all, you can't even _tell_ if someone is copying it.
and even if you _could_, what are you gonna do about it?
call the sheriff, and tell him someone is using your font?
i'm sure they'll get right out on that, with sirens blazing.

unless you want the "thieves" to laugh at your impotence,
i'd suggest that you tone down the rhetoric a few notches,
because your hard-line looks silly without _enforcement_.

so, like all of us other artists out there, you're going to
have to find a path that you can walk in this new world...

No it doesn't.
Moral suasion is a viable alternative to coercion.
To think otherwise is to condone the police state, the warlord, the bully.

No, but it's the kind of "protection" we *have* in the USA, which was the point at question in this discussion. The professional type community is in no way lacking understanding of that, even if most of us think more/different protection would be a good thing.

@bowerbird:

Huh. So, your argument is that because lots of people are going to do "x" anyway, that makes it okay and you'll encourage people to do "x" if it is in their self-interest? Wow, not much you can't justify with that line of thinking.

But in any case, if you're going to encourage piracy, I for one won't have anything to do with you until/unless you stop. Don't expect any more helpful feedback from me.

The fact that you <em>can</em> copy fonts illegally and use them, and alot of people do, doesn't mean that you should. There is also something like respect and morale. And professionality.

hey, good for you, you've taken the first step away from

of course, "moral suasion" might not be quite as cut-and-dried
as _you_ consider it to be, but at least you're making progress...

it will take a police state to enforce our 20th-century view of
copyright in this 21st-century digital world we find ourselves.

is that the kind of world you want us to live in?

if not, then we need to create some alternatives that _work_.

oh, c'mon, don't be silly, not if i should take you seriously.

i didn't advise the original poster to "just do it" because i
wanted to encourage him to think about his self-interest,
i said it so that _you_ would think of _your_ self-interest,
most specifically about the wisdom of your current path...

you invoke "the law", but you have no way to _enforce_ it.
you couldn't even get the "authorities" to enforce it for you!

don't you realize how impotent that makes you?

and yes, i certainly understand how utterly frustrated and
powerless that impotence makes you feel, because i feel it,
just like every creative artist today feels it, because we're all
in the same boat.  people can "take" our stuff without paying.

but sticking your head in the sand won't solve the problem.
running away won't solve the problem.

what we need to do is to turn "the problem" to our advantage.

i think it's possible to do that.  i firmly believe it's possible.

indeed, i think this "problem" is an opportunity in disguise.

i think it will turn out to be the best thing that ever happened
to artists, and to our fans, and to society, and to our planet...

i think we can finally overturn _greed_, and save the earth.

and we'd better hurry, because the way that i see the future,
we've only got about a decade left.  so we better get to work.

as i said, ethics is a better argument than "the law".

but if you believe that "ethics" is clearly on your side,
you will soon find that some people disagree with you.

they will argue they haven't "stolen" anything from you,
since you still have everything you had, or have ever had.

if they steal your car, they will have it, and you will not...
if they "steal" your font, they have it, and you still have it.

they might even turn the "ethics" argument _against_ you.
they'll say that since the variable cost of copying your font
is next to nothing, the price you are charging is a rip-off.

whether you agree with any of these positions is irrelevant,
because they are the reality inside the head of the "pirates".
so if you can't argue against 'em, you'll never be successful.

there are other arguments too.  some people see a solid
relationship between "piracy" and _increases_ in sales...

even if you don't buy that, it's fairly clear that "pirates"
won't become "buyers" even if you thwart their "piracy".
since they never will be customers, you didn't "lose" them.

but no matter what, if you want to purse the "ethics" path,
you're going to have to engage in _dialog_, in _education_.

you're gonna have to participate in some _communication_
with the "pirates", and they aren't gonna come to the table
if the first thing out of your mouth is "that's illegal, thief!"


>   But you seem to be interested only in convenience, or 
>   perhaps clueless rebellion, which is weakness of character.

you're quick to judge, and to judge unfairly, and incorrectly.

and if you treat all of the so-called "pirates" so flippantly,
don't be surprised if they're unwilling to dialog with you...

and, because it doesn't seem to have soaked in quite yet,
i'll remind you again that you are impotent to stop them.

if you really want to use "ethics", you'll have to do dialog.

-bowerbird

p.s.  i've never pirated a font in my life.  or bought one.
i already have more fonts on my computer than i need
-- heck, all i need is one font, to be honest with you --
and they all came bundled when i bought it.  i don't care
about fonts.  never have.  only sissies care about fonts...       ;+)

Please, don't patronize me.

Like another recent new poster here, Eric Schrijver, you are laboring under a misapprehension. 
But fonts are not "in the same boat" as music, literature and art.  
A font is not a consumable cultural end-product.
It is a professional tool that adds value to work.
Certainly, piracy is an issue, but not in the same way as for writing, songs and pictures.

<em>it will take a police state to enforce our 20th-century view of copyright in this 21st-century digital world we find ourselves. is that the kind of world you want us to live in?</em>

Actually, that's why I was advocating moral suasion!
i.e. "Don't do it, it's illegal and therefore bad."
Not, "Don't do it, it's illegal, and you will be punished."

Digital media makes nonsense of traditional copyright protection.
But that's not a good reason to abolish intellectual property rights. 

<em>...alternatives that _work_.</em>

Some of those alternatives are at MyFonts.
Such as non-commercial/professional licences and freemiums.

Which is of course what this is. But you should excuse people for giving up on hopeless cases, especially when all the arguments being presented are old and worn, and have already been largely addressed on Typophile, by the very people in this thread.

At the margin, however, there's substantial ambiguity that requires legal clarification; what is fair or moral depends on which side of the line you're on (general sentiment here being important, but not the only valuable perspective). 

It's important to clarify the rights of creators, but the rights of users, too. We've heard here EULA disputes, where a creator thinks a restriction is "fair" and the user does not. The typical reaction here is to tell the user, "take it or leave it", but legislatures may have something to say.</div>

we will just have to disagree that "illegal and therefore bad"
constitutes "moral suasion".  anyone so brain-dead to build
moral philosophy around "what's legal" is, um, brain-dead.
the law, as they say, is an ass.

what _i_ mean by "moral suasion" is a _logical_argument_
something is "wrong", one which convinces (or "persuades").

maybe it's not.  (or maybe it is.)  but you'll need to _give_reasons_.
because a simple-minded assertion isn't gonna convince _anyone_.

For English readers, I recommend

- G.E.Moore, "Principia Ethica" and "Ethics"
- P.H.Nowell-Smith, "Ethics"

Scholarly books on ethics reveal puzzling "naturalistic fallacies"
(see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy).

Nowell-Smith wrote in 1954 in his "Ethics" on page 41:

<strong>"Yes, you have convinced me that it is the right thing to do;
but ought I to do it?"</strong>

I stated above: "It is my opinion that any work should get its adequate remuneration, and this also applies to designers of fonts", and I think that decent people such as Nick Shinn are above reproach and should receive our support. But this industry does not only consist of decent one-man-designer-foundries, but is infested with many companies which rip off the fonts designed by others on a large scale and sell them under their own labels.

Those who think that downloading is unethical should modify the question and ask: "Is it unethical to download the fonts of rip-off foundries?"</div>

p.s.  and just so the all-important communication is clear...

"we" above does not mean "me and you" for certain values
of "you"; nope, it means "me and the _other_ people here".

and "you" certainly does not mean _you_, at least not for
any _singular_ value of "you"; please do not, as the kids
say, "take it personally", since it refers solely to the _plural_
form of you, as in "the vast majority of you" and note that
it expressly does _not_ mean "all of you", as some of you
have already eliminated yourselves, of your own volition,
and i'm fine with that, and thank you for your fine decision.     :+)

that is, to rewrite for those of _you_ who need such a rewrite...

"get it out of your systems, kids, so we (that is, me and the
_other_ people here) can start work, as i got a lot of questions
you (as in, not _you_, personally, but this self-declared group
and its status as lovers of typography) might want to answer..."

...or... to put it yet another way,
"hey, i have some questions for book-designers..."

as for solutions to people who "download and use illegal fonts",
you might want to think about finding a way to gently lead them
to an alternative path instead.  ask yourself if this thread did that.

You might enjoy thinking it's to you, but it's important to remember that it's public. In fact my own participation here is somewhat parallel to public flogging; it's very useful to have threads like this to point out when yet another public nuisance decides to drop by. So thank you.

		<div class="commentbody">Despite the fact that more than one of the contributors on this subject has criticised me on another, here are the facts;

Type designers akin to Nick Shinn & David Berlow didn't wake up one morning magically able to create phenomenal fonts for nothing. These guys studied this over years and different continents in order that WE end up with finely developed typefaces. Downloading gigabytes of foundries over at ISOHUNT or PIRATEBAY and ultimately not paying for anything is clearly unacceptable. Two large corporations here in Scotland have been reprimanded for using unlicensed typefaces while a well known art school now allows their students ONLY to use the typeface collection provided and paid for BY the school. If you want free fonts for non commercial use then go to DAFONT and check the fonts you download aren't simply renamed versions of existing work - i haven't been there for a while but that WAS the case several times previously.

The fact that both Shinn & Berlow's typefaces (entire foundries almost) are appearing on P2P networks (alongside many others) must be sickening for them and i would suggest that anyone who uses that system for acquiring their fonts think carefully in future - when their clients congratulate their typeface choices they should be ready to pay for them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello bb, Thomas, David - I'm coming in very late to this thread, sorry.
The initial question was:
"Is it illegal to download illegally uploaded fonts? And is it illegal to use them?"
Because of my interest in readability and font-linking on the web, I've been following this topic very closely - to the extreme of actually reading court opinions like Napster, Grokster, etc...
Just some obvious points - How can anyone know that a font was illegally uploaded until they download it and take a look at it? What if your intent is to download it, analyze it, and then, if it looks like it was uploaded in violation of the EULA, report the situation to the foundry so they can issue a DMCA take-down notice? That's gotta be kosher, right?
The whole idea of that being in some way "illegal" is, to me, preposterous.

The second part of the question is trickier and depends on what the font is then used for. I don't even want to touch that one.
But I would like to re-iterate a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/comments/realfontsontheweb/P10/#20">comment</a> I made on A List Apart in reaction to publisher Jeffrey Zeldman's interview with David Berlow:
"Font creation is both labor and knowledge intensive. And the pool of people who are really good at it is small. If ever there was an example of copyright protection acting – as the framers of the Constitution intended – to promote a useful art (in other words, to encourage font-makers and keep new fonts coming) this would be such an example."

I'll set aside another pro bono publico day or two soon. But I can tell you from a brief scan, and due to my utter reluctance to ever print anything I don't have to, the Social Science Research Network Electronic Paper Collection is not. This is a document designed, formatted and published for print.

>... this would be such an example.

I appreciate your support on that part for sure. But I think it helps to reframe, for reconsideration at least, the issue from one of 'our' useful art, to the more generally useful art of document creation, a labor and knowledge intensive art, and a one whose desired rights to protection on the web includes typefaces, or is it fonts, I get confused now ;)

And because of my interest in readability and font-linking on the web, a lot has changed since this thread started.

		<div class="commentbody">The remark on Andy Warhol and "What is Art" is the exact reason that there is a question as to this subject, I think what we have here is the "Artist" not realizing the chains that the change of this new distribution method breaks.  It is the artists responsibility to adapt to the new market.  Which at this time unfortunately is a sort of hip hop generation of "sampling" on piece of art and making it a new piece of art.  This is why I cling so tightly to the open source software and belief.  There will be a time, if you and I are not careful in the next decade we will find ourselves strictly behind cloud software where we lease our time on the software we are using and give it proceeds for it benefiting our product.  Free is the new business model and you should be able to get behind it and leverage it if you are worth your salt in whatever you do.  There is a correct way to go about "Licensing" products, but you would notice if you did not charge every person who "tries" to make a project work but only those that have made it work you will notice more people "sampling" your art or work, and the better they get at working with it.  What is art, if art is mimicking life, and life is mimicking art, we need to make room for art to mimic art, and except the reality that cd's were never worth $17.00 some bands many one hit wonders would have actually made money with I-tunes today, isn't it amazing that a software company not a music company, utilizing the market and the new means of distribution comes out with the next generation "Walkman"  and then corners the market on how to distribute this new "Product".  My main point is when people are standing there saying "give me, give me.... mine!!! Mine!!!"  Other people are standing there saying Hmmmm.... how can I make money on this??? Please use these words or this Idea freely as I am FULL OF IT....(dah dah dah dah dah) I will not and can not subscribe to a capitalist idea that pits neighbor vs neighbor, We are in a Global Market and most Americans are trying to make there fortune in the Court room.

Free is not a business model. The part that "monetizes" the free, that's the business model. Whether it's paid advertising, or folks paying for something else, I don't know.

For fonts, the only convincing business model I've seen that's built on top of free in any sense is this: some companies or organizations will find it in their interest to pay people to develop fonts that will then be open source. I don't think this will be sufficiently large scale to be a very large amount of type design, compared to what happens today. So, if nobody is willing to pay for fonts, I expect most folks who currently design type will have to find something else to do.

I agree with Richard that the protections of copyright are quite appropriate for fonts. However, I recognize that in today's world of easy data transfer, such protections are rather thin.

BTW, don't assume that I think that US copyright laws are reasonable. I think that the length of copyright protection in the USA is not merely excessive but completely insane. Life of the author plus 70 years? For work for hire, 120 years from creation or 95 from first publication, whichever comes first? That's Goofy.

Sorry, couldn't resist the Disney reference.

I've yet to meet a type designer who isn't talented beyond type design. I've yet to meet a type designer who isn't intelligent.
People with talent and intelligence are going to find a way to roll with the punches.

The move to digital distribution requires an incredible leap of faith. There are so many questions unanswered. It's hard to see who profits besides Google and Amazon and Apple and the service providers.
Lately, I've been thinking about what initially drove the first Europeans to migrate to America. Most stayed put, so it couldn't have been *that* bad.
What went through the minds of those who pioneered the American West? These people knew they were venturing into unknown, dangerous country. Death could await just as easily as a new life. What gave them the guts or the optimism to face that? Don't know.
Anyway, in this case, the open prairie is coming to us - no need to travel!
