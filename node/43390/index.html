so these are extremely preliminary. The logos are for green wheels, an organization based on alternative forms of transportation, with concerns regarding city planning, bicycle availability, bus routes, etc. The main thing that the organization does is put out a quarterly newspaper, which I am in charge of laying out. I thought that since the magazine addressed many different issues on multiple occasions, that it would be nice to have an icon for each occasion. I'm wondering if this kind of thing works for a logo at all.</div>

oh and in case you couldn't recognize the TRebuchet. That's what it is. They also made me use Curlz for a flier so... *pain*.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Hofweber, Curls, yes, quite painful! Appreciate their enthusiasm but tactfully find a way to remind them that you are the designer.

I am about to give you the safe and traditional approach for your project. 
Is the initial mark in black the Green Works primary logo? If not, I would suggest to break your project into stages. Get the primary logo approved by ALL stakeholders first. Only then would I move on to developing a supporting set of icons. First by getting a solid approved list of those supporting services (roads, trails). These lockups, including the word of the service, along with its' icon should not violate (placed in front of, as the orange pylon or a road in the gw) the primary mark but live with it/around it. Each service should be displayed with the same font. You use several different above. Each icon should also look as if it had been designed from the same hand. Rather, illustrated by the same person. The above, forgive me, has a clip art feel to it. The icons need to be a simple quick visual read. THey should be able to stand on their own and the reader should understand it immediately. If not, it needs work. If budget permits, hire an illustrator to execute these icons. You can't be all things. The icon/service word lockups should be a single color fill. The entire color palette should harmonize. The word and icon for each service should always be in the same position, same size, same overall weight and treatment. 

Again, this is the safe approach. By safe, I do not mean boring. This approach is simply proven to work. Please let me know if I am clear on my suggestions. Most importantly, do not stuck in the pattern of the client taking this to option 99. THey'll like it when they they see it type of thing. No one wants to design for a moving target. Never drop your work on the table and ask them, "So, what do you think?" It lacks confidence. You are the design professional. They hired you. Tell them, constructively, why it works and give them little "opinion wiggle room". Get them involved and jazzed about it, just don't let them dictate everything...like using the dreaded CURLZ font. (They can keep that for their kid's birthday invitations.)

I am one person with one suggestion. There are plenty of talented people here that surely have other suggestions. Listen to them all. Somewhere in the middle of it is where you'll set your compass to. Good luck and enjoy it!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The situation with curlz is that they had already made event invitations without consulting me and not knowing that I would do the poster. Even with something as dumb as curlz it's important to maintain event identity so I let it slide.

You are right about the quick read being important. Unfortunately it is not within our budget to hire an illustrator, let alone me. I'm doing this all pro-bono as an exercise and self promotion, just like everyone else working there (there are three main people). All words shown there are the same typeface (trebuchet). The original logo has been approved by everyone, so I thought I would expand. I'll try to work on the color palette.</div>
