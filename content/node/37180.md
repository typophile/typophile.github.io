body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nI will be purchasing Matthew Carter's well designed Miller
  very soon. I will use it for all sorts of document composition- (but for right now,
  r\xE9sum\xE9 work). I think I should consider a titling/nameplate face beside Miller
  Display (even though I will buy this too eventually)- most likely a serif face.
  I am considering Mantinia and Big Caslon to have anyway, but I don't think it matches
  the whole scotch roman vibe. I already have a Clarendon style face for display but
  again- more doubts.\r\n\r\nThe matching sans (the hardest thing to match) should
  have tabular figures since Miller does not have them- also have small caps. I think
  the sans should be neutral to let Miller shine- but not harsh like 99% of the sans
  coming out these days. Perhaps even go with the period.\r\n\r\nIf I was to ask what
  sans to match FF Clifford would the responses be the same? I will buy that too but
  more into future when Akira releases the Opentype version.\r\n\r\nIs Miller to powerful
  a design for a sans friend?\r\n\r\nThank you guys,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz"

    Chronicle also comes in a text version.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100031"

    I think there's a counterpoint of moods going on which seems to work well. Miller's
    Italic is so pretty I sometimes use that for Display too.\r\n\r\nI also recently
    bought the Chronicle text and display families, and they are superb. They're gorgeous,
    delightful to work with and the technical execution is perfect. And if you haven't
    bought anything from H&FJ, get ready, because their customer service is superb!\r\n\r\nEager
    to hear what others have to say on this topic. "

  body: "Exactly. \r\n\r\nHappily, they are both beautiful and technically well-made,
    so working with them is a joy. I bought Chronicle to sort of freshen things up
    a bit and to have a Scotch that felt a little more now, for certain projects I
    will be working on.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "When I see Chronicle, I see Georgia for Text. Its very newsy- very few visual
    treats. But I guess that's what makes Chronicle superior for cramming lots of
    text into a page- like a newspaper. Miller less so - but much prettier.\r\n\r\nFrom
    what I have experienced from Mr. Carters types, they are very well done too- AND
    THE KERNING IS TO DIE FOR!!! I love the kerning, very tight and comprehensive.
    I have not purchased anything from HF&J yet. The opentype Didot is serious way
    up the list.\r\n\r\nFreight Sans is a nice choice, But then I should probably
    think about Freight Serif too.\r\n\r\nWhat about a grot?\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/strathmore3_3426.png]\r\n\r\nJust to
    remind everyone of Miller's personality I posted a screen shot of the Strathmore
    paper site taken a while back. I like how they used Mercury as the nameplate/logo.
    It goes, when I would have though that would be too matchy-matchy. (not that I'm
    a huge fan of Mercury either)\r\n\r\nmalbright> What was so special about HF&J
    service?\r\n\r\nmarcox> Griffith gothic is a little too newsy again for my taste
    but what you've done is beautiful. Whitney and Benton also seem to have a similar
    structure... well duh.. the same designer :-) Benton is probably closer to my
    taste. I love the way it looks in Craft magazine.\r\n\r\nDoes FB include tabular
    figures in their fonts? I don't see that info anywhere. Its very important as
    I need all the capability in the matching sans.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that
    type with ball terminals are super readable; combine that with Miller's efficient
    structure, interesting details, and I have winning system. I am trying to increase
    my repertoire of serious text fonts. This is just the beginning.\r\n\r\nMikey
