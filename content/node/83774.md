  body: "\"Missing glyph\" means that your class definitions refer to glyphs that
    aren't in the font. \r\n\r\nThe \"kern\" feature definition shouldn't be empty.
    You can just omit it. In Preferences, make sure the \"Generate 'kern' feature
    if it is undefined or outdated\" is enabled. "

    \r\nAlso, how can I generate \"kern\" feature to show up in preview?\r\n"

  body: "In other words, how do I fix all this mess? :)\r\n\r\nP.S. I noticed that
    all these \"missing characters\" are glyphs with \"undercomma\" accent. What's
    strange is that I have them already created (with name and unicode) but FL asks
    me \"if I want to create these missing characters\" (basically duplicate with
    same unicodes).\r\nIs it because there is no \"conventional\" names for undercomma
    characters and I have renamed them myself to \"Xundercomma\" ?"

  body: "Got to this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Error_5723.JPG]\r\nIt's
    because my my \"kern\" is feature is empty. So I deleted it and now I can preview
    other features. \r\nBut how do I preview kerning?"

    you compile the features, FLS will automatically convert your Metrics Window +
    Classes panel kerning into an OT \"kern\" feature. "

  body: I do. Yes, it works fine outside FL, but so does it mean there's no way to
    preview class-based kerning in Preview pane?

  body: Just hit generate  again in the metrics window and it will ask if you want
    to rebuild the kern feature. Hit yes.
