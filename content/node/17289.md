body: Do you ever come across graphic deisgn that is so sexy and sumptuous you just
  want to lick it? I came across the website for <a href="http://theheadsofstate.com">the
  heads of state</a> about a year ago when i was trying to teach myself some css.
  their wesite is so simple and beautiful, i just fell in love with its design. and
  then they have some beautifuly typographic rock posters for some of my favorite
  bands! i wish i could buy them all. i did buy one of those beauties and when it
  arrived i didn't want to lick it anymore. i wanted to enshrine it and hang it on
  the wall. it looks absolutely gorgeous in my small little apt above the p22 offices.
  now if you'll excuse me, i hafta go buy some candldles...

  body: Great stuff. Not sure I'd lick it or not. My niece was smelling things today.
    She thinks pink shirts smell prettier than turquoise. I have seen design that
    makes my heart palpitate, but not that I've wanted to lick.

  body: i got <a href="http://www.theheadsofstate.com/posters/wilco_new_york_city/">this
    one</a>. although i didn't go to this show, i'd hafta say wilco is one of the
    best bands i've ever seen live and living in ny now... and besides, the design
    is just breathtaking. love it.

    they've produced.  I love their (retro) style.  I wouldn't really mind having
    some of those posters on my wall even if I didn't like the band."

    think that's going to be one of the sounds for the new Fontographer 2006! >^P"
