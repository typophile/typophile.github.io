  find it odd they used Bodoni or something similar to title this new book by Senator
  Jim Webb, former military man, a guy who always looks like he's chewing bullets?
  \r\nTo me it sure doesn't bring up the concept of \"fight\" - unless it's a knockdown-dragout
  in a fashion design house or somewhere similarly elegant. \r\n\r\nI would've used
  something aggressive yet dignified. Any suggestions?"

  body: I dunno. Seems like it would be a good idea to de-emphasize the physical aggression
    connotations of his Marine Corps background (as ex-Army myself, that's definitely
    not a gratuitous swipe at the military), and transfer the idea of 'fight' to a
    more intellectual battleground -- reasoning together instead of confrontation,
    that kind of thing.

    Isn't Optima John McCain's font?  I bet the designer was a Republican. :)
