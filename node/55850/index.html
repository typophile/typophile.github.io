Here´s a new serif I´m working on. I would appreciate it very much if you could take a look at it and tell me what you think. Any feedback is welcome.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I say what I think:

- The serifs of the lowercase have a peculiar shape, I would like to see the same kind of logic applied to the capitals too. 
- I would also try to make the foot serifs of n,m, etc. more asymmetric.
- I think you can also try different alternatives for Q, maintaining the same concept of a single movement.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is looking good! What's it for? I'm assuming text (and looking at the vertical metrics, I'm guessing books rather than newspapers)? It'd be great to have a bit more info.

Here are a few comments, be sure to have salt ready.

It's great to see bdpq executed like this. If you don't mind telling, where do these come from (read, what other fonts were you looking at while making them)?

I really like the "a" too &ndash; it's beautiful.

I wonder about the terminals on the "c", "f" and "r" (the latter seems a bit too soft/bulbous/stubby in context). Have you tried using it on the "s" as well? Because with its rather long straight serifs, the "s" looks surprisingly hard/determined/closed in comparison. Then again, comparing with the caps (see below) maybe the "s" is cool, and it's that c/f/r terminal that is too soft?

I'm not sure about the "k"; it looks beautiful by itself, but seeing it in text* I'm wondering if the leg might need more air.
* Assuming this is meant for text.

Looking at the caps: Is it intentional that they're notably spikier/"harder" than the lowercase? The "C" looks especially Dracula-esque ;-). (It might also be leaning left a bit.)

There seems to be something slightly lopsided about the weight/contrast on the "M". Also, the heavy diagonal of the "A" might be a hair heavier than say the one on the "N"?

The "Q" is an interesting experiment! Something slightly Non-Latin-looking about it. But it doesn't quite work for my eyes yet. It has a slightly uncomfortable lean/twist, and looks kind of large; the tail may also be looping up a bit too much, almost clashing with say a following "u".

"T" might be a bit wide? Also, I think your "To" is overkerned.

"W" might be a bit heavy (though it might just look like that on my printout), and slightly unbalanced.

By the way, please switch off automatic ligatures in InDesign when making your samples as long as you don't have any. ;-)

I'm beginning to note some interesting stylistic confluences in the Serif board. Must be something in the air. :-)
I'll be curious to see this progress.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Steven
This is looking pretty polished already. It definitely looks friendly and useable. I love the proportions and design. There's a nice amount of space overall (because I'm currently struggling with spacing in my font!). Your a reminds me a bit of Chaparral. 
The two things that jump out at me are your Q and the vertical serifs. The Q I think could try a straighter southwest curve and tail. The vertical serifs on CEFGSTZs and z seem too straight to me, especially against the curves serifs of adhijklmnpqr and u. I'm not sure what the solution is, but perhaps they need to be wider and/or shorter?
Could W be a touch wider or Z narrower? Could the knee of k be a bit lower? I love the shape.
The capitals with curves look like their sidebearings might be a bit wide. 
The two heavy strokes of M are not balanced, I think. L looks narrow.
Well done with this, it'll be really nice :)

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you so far for your comments. I have uploaded a new PDF (_002.pdf) and changed some points you mentioned. The major changings are at the k and Q shown at the picture. Also I tried to correct the diagonal contrast a bit and the sidebearings of the round capitals.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/QQkk_4222.gif]

I designed the font for small sizes from about 7 to 9 points. This is the regular weight but maybe I should make a little lighter version and make the semibold versionout of this!? 

I wanted to achieve a calligraphic, fresh and smooth look but on the other hand it should have a classic and not too clean apperance. Fonts I looked at were mostly Rialto, Maiola, Palatino and Dolly.

"cfr" have pen shaped terminals and the "s" have a single sided serif like in venetian faces. If I would change the serif of the "s" and make it pen shaped like "cfr" the "z" would be the only letter that matches the spured serifs of the capitals. 

And thanx Hrant for warning me about the name Apollonia. Maybe someone has a better name for it. I am grateful for every suggestion.</div>

Were they Adobe fonts? Because many people think they're watered down in terms of optical scaling. Or perhaps they were wide fonts? That reduces the x-height necessity; but your design is a bit on the narrow side. In my view 60-something percent is for normal text sizes (for a narrowish design).

That, or one of these two:
1) Just make the x-height larger.
2) Make a statement (à la Smeijers) that text fonts should be much darker than they are. But of course you'd have to believe that first. I actually do myself, but maybe not <em>that</em> dark. Or maybe yes indeed.

BTW, you really have to end up making at least two weights
anyway, so that interrobang-and-a-half is uncalled for.  :-)

The "Ihx" on the left is the old one. 
In the "Ihx" in the middle, the x-height is the same but it is wider.
The right one has a larger x-height but the same width as the original.

I also made the ascenders a bit higher.</div>

It'd be good to see a PDF if you decide to follow that way.
Just to see how it looks, I'd cut off inner serif (as you did in th "Y") in the "x", or at least those of the wide stroke.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, both* can work, but first you should decide the intended point size of the design; although the process of designing will always reveal unexpected useful directions, eventually you to have make willful decisions on them. So the necessary darkness, proportions and spacing will come out only once you make the intended size decision.

* And there's a third option: lightening. Although I'm starting to think that maybe it's not impractically dark after all.

I like the steps you walked on with your font.
Now it addresses a better weight and character.
When it is time, you'll need to face some hinting 'cause at smaller sizes it looks very weird (IMO). In the meanwhile, nevermind.
Your "x" looks beautiful.

The "ﬁ" ligature is too wonky to my eyes.
Th "ﬂ" ligature is finer, but it needs to be much softer in the end.
Your last "ß" is better (I'd try by quitting the right serif, at the risk of appearing "seriphobic", though I'm not).

Except for the fact that it looks wide a bit, I'm unsure about the "ß": I think you'll find the best help in Nina; as Ben's told, I can't speak about a letter that is not usual for me (when I was a child I thought it was some kind of "B").
Your question mark and your "ﬁ" look great.
