  body: I'm just wondering, with such an elegant background, if you haven't left the
    words a bit bereft of the same treatment. Certainly within the chosen family there
    are variations to spice, sorry for the pun, it up. I would lean towards a supple
    serifed font with a complimentary sans for annotation.

  body: Yes, I second typerror, ad serifs so it is elegant. Justify the first two
    first paragraphs. From  the line "goods" align on at left with top paragraphs.
    Ad a 3rd column for the price, and make the description in two lines, maybe italic.
    Heavy brown. Maybe a lighter background and darker color for the text, but that
    is your choice.

  body: "I dont think I would set the menu itself in such a thin italic, especially
    white on a dark background. Maybe it would be better in print than on screen,
    although there could possibly be some minor ink bleed (or an optical effect with
    the same result). That would probably be bad for such thin type. Maybe a slightly
    heavier weight would be safer. \r\n\r\nAnd why not just regular with italics to
    emphasize certain things? Or the names in regular and the description in italics,
    or vice versa?\r\n\r\nBut I dont think you need a serif for it to look elegant
    or 'posh'. This looks elegant and modern at the same time, while a serif might
    quickly look clich\xE9-elegant.  "

  body: "The idea behind the typeface choice was probably to avoid being too old fashioned,
    right? And I have to say, I like it. I'd be there. I'm hungry already.\r\nBut
    using an oblique\u2026 that's just a shame (as you probably know). On the front
    page, with the uppercase, that's okay. It's chic, but it isn't classical chic,
    which you got from the thin sans. But using an oblique (for so much text) should
    be avoided. Although hey, I know it's a type-sin, but I don't hate it. (OMG, what
    am I saying!?)\r\nThat said, I think I'd lose the oblique altogether and get a
    thin sans with a real italic, though. And probably let the type and the ornaments
    breathe a little on the front page. I have no problem with the inexistence of
    serifs on this.\r\n\r\nI agree with adding a 3rd column for prices (and with dropping
    them! \u20AC7 for a burger?!), which will make all the descriptions fit two lines
    (to get some cadence, which I think is nice on a list), but I wouldn't think justifying
    the first paragraphs is really necessary. And I think it's possible that you'll
    have a hard time printing (and then reading) that thin sans in white with such
    a dark background, but that all depends.\r\nNot that I know anything, mind you!\r\n\r\nOh,
    and typerror: that's \"complementary\". You'll get hell with that mistake around
    here! :P"

  body: "Once again I'm reminded how lucky I am to have found such a fantastic design
    community.\r\n\r\nThanks Typophiles, your input is always greatly appreciated,
    and I'll definately be taking on board your considerations - the chosen typeface
    is currently Gotham, which pairs famously with Didot - I'll experiment with that.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    considering I'm a mere mortal student, how much would you recommend I charge for
    menu \"case\" (i.e folder) and the menu design itself? The chef wants to be able
    to change the menu on a whim considering the content, so he's requested an A3
    setup which will be folded, and A4 insets with the actual menu.\r\n\r\nI've always
    been taught \"get what you can\" - \"scale your price with the client's abiity
    to pay\" by both my internship employers and my self-employed bricklayer father,
    but I'm finding the pricing process difficult for 'our thing' </sopranos>\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPaul"

  body: "this is just a quickie:\r\n\r\nto me, the fancy doo-dad underneath Hamburger
    looks off-centre.  And I know it's not, but it looks that way because of the odd
    letter you've had to work with.\r\n\r\nfirst idea that pops into my head:\r\n\r\nwhat
    if you eliminated the bottom doo-dad and just had a straight line, then emphasized
    the top one a little more?\r\n\r\nhope this helps, I'm not wide and experienced,
    but how it is now would bother me ever so slightly if I popped in for some lunch."
