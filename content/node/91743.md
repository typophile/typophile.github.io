body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nI suppose the goal of producing a font good enough to write
  a book with is a bit audacious for a blatant amateur's first \"serious\" typeface.
  Well, I've given it a first try anyway. \r\n\r\nI admit that many (if not most)
  serif types look alike to my untrained eye. Recently, however, I fell in love with
  FF Quadraat on the cover of a book. It managed to look beautiful and original despite
  being perfectly legible and \"well-behaved\".  Of course, I immediately wanted to
  create something like it of my own.\r\n\r\nMy design goals were to make each letter
  as beautiful as I could while still maintaining a consistent style across the letters
  and a comfortable reading feel at small sizes. After some exuberant doodling followed
  by some grudging tempering for legibility's sake, I finally ended up with the following.
  Working title: <strong>Callisti</strong>, Greek for \"most beautiful\". I'm also
  thinking of other nymph-based names, such as Pegaia or Naiad.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/callisti_v0_4390.1.png]\r\n\r\nWhaddya
  think? Is it worth pursuing this project? I know it's a lot of work, and I'd rather
  not start with it if it is doomed to fail.\r\n\r\nIf a book-capable font turns out
  to be too hard, I will probably turn this into a display font. I started out Callisti
  with an extremely low-bowled <em>a</em> that I had to moderate in order to make
  it legible at small sizes. For the display font, I would probably return it to its
  former extreme:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_3635.png]\r\n\r\nOpinions?"

    \ I was wondering whether I could pull it off, though. In small sizes, it looks
    pretty similar to a traditional lowercase <em>q</em>.\r\n\r\nI decided the <em>k</em>
    was too far away from the intended style, and made a more normal one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/request_5310.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/request_small_4873.png]\r\n\r\nGood

  body: "Ideally, you should post a pdf with dummy text, in multiples sizes, although
    what Bert recommended would probably work well. This can be zoomed for a closer
    look, or printed. An example of something similar would be: http://typophile.com/files/20120401-text.pdf
    If you're designing this in Illustrator, that might be difficult to do, but required
    if you're doing a text font. If you're not already using a font program, you should
    move into that as soon as possible. A great program for beginners is Glyphs. Fontographer
    is also good. Most pros use Fontlab, although some have moved to Robofont, or
    use in-house development tools. I mainly use Fontforge.\r\n\r\nI have a few recommendations.
    Take what I say with a grain of salt\u2014there are a lot of different schools
    of thought among Typophiles. I think this is probably worth pursuing, and there
    are a number of interesting things going on. However, you need to work on optically
    unifying the weights of all your strokes. The x-height also bounces up and an
    awful lot. In fact, letters like 'u' extend even above the round shapes. That's
    a no-no. There also seems to be varying levels of finish on your letters. Try
    an think about them all as members of a family, and not individual letters by
    themselves.\r\n\r\nIf most serif fonts look identical to your eyes, you might
    consider learning about the differences and classification, and studying the forms
    more. Another thing that might help you is to read other critique threads here
    on Typophile. You can learn a ton from them. The thread on Ernestine is really
    great."

    of course, on language. In italian, for example, very common words like \u201Cthis,
    that, some, when, so, any\u201D, all start with q (questo, quello, qualche, quando,
    quindi, qualunque/qualsiasi). And there also are water (acqua), square (adjective,
    quadrato), and so on."

    and the two diagonals consistent between characters, but I suppose one needs to
    keep those flexible in order to achieve <em>optical</em> consistency. Is there
    a trick to balancing out the weights of different characters? Or is it just fiddling
    with all the strokes until it looks right? Same thing with the x-height; the fact
    that even the vertical stems have slanted and flat parts at the top makes it tricky."

  body: "<blockquote>Is there a trick to balancing out the weights of different characters?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure there are any \"tricks\", but to do everything optically. I had a lot
    of trouble with that originally\u2014I always wanted to make the stems exactly
    the same thickness (mathematically), and optically it doesn't tend to work. Your
    stems all seem to thin right now compared to other parts of the letters. The diagonals
    don't actually work\u2014in the case of the 'v', the left side should be your
    thick side and be about the same thickness as the stems. Note you need to measure
    at the angle of incline, if you're measuring. I use some old calipers for measuring
    (stole the idea from Dunwich Type), and that works really good because I hate
    fiddling with digital measuring tools, but you can use the ruler in Inkscape or
    Fontforge and that'll work fine. Or you can copy a straight-stemmed letter like
    'i' and rotate it over top of your 'v' at the angle the stroke goes. That would
    be a good starting point for the thick side. The thin side wants to probably be
    as thin as the bar of the 'e' or crossbar of the 't'.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I'm currently
    working in Inkscape, and intend to move to FontForge. So I should be doing the
    rest of the characters inside FontForge?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI highly recommend
    it. That will get you thinking about things like body size and sidebearings much
    more early on, and allow you to quickly make tests for print. It's hard to get
    used to at first, but you'll need to learn Fontforge anyway if you plan to use
    it. I'd recommend opening up other fonts and seeing how they're put together.
    It's probably a good idea to look at Fontforge files too, since they will be the
    most \"human understandable\", because it will be in source form, and some of
    the background layers and other things will probably still be in there. My <a
    href=\"http://impallari.com/projects/overview/neuton-serif-family\">Neuton</a>
    has the .sfd files available in the download Raph Levian also has <a href=\"http://levien.com/type/myfonts/\">some
    fonts</a> on his website with download of the .sfd files, although many of them
    are not at all finished."

    but smaller.) I hold 'em up to the screen and adjust them to the width of whatever
    I am measuring. I always measure to compare, so I then move to the other part
    or glyph I want to compare it to and hold it up. Works like a charm\u2014better
    than a ruler for comparison. I think straight \"pointers\" or something to that
    effect, used in drafting, is more appropriate, but I don't have any of those.
    Anyway this saves time for me."
