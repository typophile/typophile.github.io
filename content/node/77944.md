body: "I was recently made aware that my single best-selling font, Satisfaction, is
  being offered as a free download by a site called ffonts.net. Turns out there have
  been almost 15,000 downloads of it, and I only became aware because one of those
  people bothered to write and ask if it was okay to use it for free.\r\n\r\nI've
  tried to contact the people who run the site and ask them to remove it as a free
  download \u2014 it's never been a free font \u2014 but they have not responded to
  multiple emails. Contact and identifying information on their website is very sparse.
  Does anyone here know anything about the site, and/or know how I can contact them?
  I hate to get a lawyer involved, but Satisfaction is my main font and I can't afford
  to watch another 15,000 copies given away for free. My copyright statement is part
  of the font info, but no one at the website and none of the other thousands of downloaders
  ever bothered to contact me about it before.\r\n\r\nAaaargh!"

  body: They've never responded to my requests either. Most free font sites will respond
    to removal requests but once in a while you have to shut a site down. In my experience
    its been really easy to get a font site shut down. I never used a lawyer for this.
    Usually the host has a policy for dealing with pirated materials. The form for
    removal may seem like such a pain to fill out. Being a hater of paperwork, I cut
    a few corners and it was just as effective. The ISP will attempt to contact the
    site. If, after a few days they haven't responded, they'll kill the site. That's
    been my experience and one of the sites was In Germany.

  body: "<cite>I can also shot that guy who stole my wallet</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is
    not a proper comparison. To steal a wallet is a crime against property and you
    cannot answer this with an action against life. But if the thief threatens your
    life, you can shot him/her when this is needed to protect yourself. Lawful responses
    need to be related to the offense nature.\r\n\r\n<cite>I was not aware that they
    gave away their power to ISPs.</cite>\r\n\r\nThey don't. But in everyday life
    we have dozens of conflicts managed by private or adminstrative resources \u2013since
    the excessive noise caused by the guy next door till return policies used by a
    shop. If they cannot solve the problem, then you have courts and judges. Judicial
    measure don't need to be the first option to solve conflicts (and actually aren't
    in many countries nowadays).\r\n\r\nImagine the difficulties Ray, living in Japan
    (or you, in Egypt, or I, in Brazil), would face to make a Romanian company to
    stop an illegal procedure based on servers in Germany. Much better to have a direct
    way to stop this.\r\n\r\nOf course, we are talking about indisputed and clear
    illegalities. If there is a reasonable doubt about it, the situation cannot be
    solved so simply.\r\n"

    is the whole point; who decides what qualifies as \"indisputed and clear illegalities\"
    and what not? if not court and other legal authorities. Well, someone might find
    it acceptable for an ISP to take such rule, but making it a criterion for \"civilised\"
    countries! seriously?"

  body: "Khaled, you made me remember an eternal question there is in Hermeneutics.
    Some say that a really clear and obvious rule does not need to be interpreted.
    But other reply that to judge a rule clear and obvious is already an interpretation
    \u2013and thus there are no rules immune to interpretation.\r\n\r\nI partially
    agree with this and, logically, also partially agree with your arguments. Final
    word must come from legal authorities and ISPs aren't them. But I still think
    that some situations can (and must) receive immediate solution.\r\n\r\nA simple
    example: drugs based on isotretinoin can cause severe damage in fetuses and are
    sold under close control in many countries. Let's say I am an ISP and a site hosted
    by me is announcing direct sales of isotretinoin, without Physician prescription
    nor any kind of origin control. Someone notice me about this and I verify this
    is true -it's published on the site. Must I wait for a judge manifestation or
    is prefereable to shutdown the site immediately?\r\n\r\nThis is a situation I
    call indisputed and clear.\r\n\r\nOr let's say a site hosted by me is delivering
    free fonts. Someone notice me one of the fonts is his property and cannot be freely
    distributed. I verify the font available as free download is identical to that
    on sale in MyFonts, whose author is the person who noticed me. The font contract
    does not permit its free distribution. I call the site responsible to remove the
    font in 24h. He doesn't do that and I shutdown the site.\r\n\r\nThis is also a
    situation I call indisputed and clear.\r\n\r\nBut let's say the site owner answer
    me arguing the commercial version of this font is actually a renamed copy from
    another one, developed under GPL by a group of Ubuntu users and freely distributed
    by them. I report this to the claimer, who explains he was a member of this user
    group and did permit them to use his font under given circumstances. He later
    left the group and now sustain his permission did not include free distribution
    of the font. To avoid confusion, he changed the font name and also added some
    small improvements.\r\n\r\nWell, <em>here</em> you have a situation which cannot
    be handled by nodoby except a legal authority. Is not to the ISP evaluate how
    true are these allegations nor if the font can or can not be freely distributed.\r\n\r\nIn
    a simple statement, undisputed and clear situations relate to undisputed facts
    and clear rules."

  body: "@Khaled Hosny:\r\n<cite>So you think a country where some random guy can
    take a site down without going to court is a civilised country? pretty barbaric
    to me.</cite>\r\nWhile the term \"civilized country\" was actually being used
    somewhat in jest, this isn't really vigilante justice.\r\nIn the Western industrialized
    countries, copyright laws are strictly enforced. Individuals who intentionally
    violate them are potentially subject to severe legal penalties.\r\nInternet Service
    Providers are not held responsible for every web site which they host, because
    it would be unreasonable for them to inspect each web site for copyright violations.
    However, they are legally obligated not to be a party to a copyright infringement.\r\nSo
    it is possible - in the United States, there is a formalized procedure, the DMCA
    takedown notice, for this - for a copyright owner to advise an ISP that a site
    which it hosts is infringing one of its copyrights.\r\nIn the United States, under
    this formal model, the ISP is obligated to pull the site, unless it is willing
    to accept responsibility itself that the content is not infringing, but the site
    owner can then deny the infringement. Because of this, there are legal penalties
    for a false DMCA takedown notice.\r\nEven where this doesn't exist, normally,
    one notifies the ISP, they will investigate on their own to ensure the complaint
    is not frivolous, and if the site is ignoring copyrights, as they are understood
    in the ISP's country, they will pull it so as not to be a party to an illegality."

    get a legitimate license. Thanks to other vigilant watchers I was also able to

    site, it can be moved to a new host. It probably takes less time to move to a

    If an ISP sets down rules and the customer doesn't follow them and doesn't respond,
    they can move to a new host.\r\n\r\nffonts.net contacted me too and the issue
