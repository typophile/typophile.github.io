    the other characters and the curves on the U are uneven. I suspect that it''s
    a freeware font to which a white stroke has been added to lighten it up...'

  body: Thanks a lot Nick for your answer. You're probably right about a font mixing
    and an outline stroke to contrast the font... I would really like to know which
    these fonts could be, even free. A, R and T are so elegant...
