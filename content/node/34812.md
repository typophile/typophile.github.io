  across (as happens many times) content that needs to be listed and bullet pointed/accentuated
  in some way.\r\nWhat is the most elegant way of structuring this list? Should I
  use \r\n\u2022 bullet points at constant type size\r\n\u2022 bullet points slightly
  larger than type size\r\n- dashes\r\n- m dashes\r\n* some bespoke icon\r\n+ etc
  / other??\r\n\r\nAny advice welcome...\r\nI guess all I want is something that will
  look elegant...and if there is any concensus on this.\r\nFYI Type used in this exercise
  is Gill Sans\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated\r\ncheers\r\nJavier"

    more common will have to do the job.'

  body: "Well, the amount of bullet points you have will be a determining factor.
    If you only have a few (say less than 5 or so), I'd recommend a more ornate bullet
    point icon; such as a custom mark, something indigenous to your select typeface,
    or even transplanted from a seperate typeface (Gill Sans's doesn't have any ornate
    bullet points that I'm aware of). \r\n\r\nIf it's a good bit more than 5 or so,
    you might want to stay with something less robust and more common, like the standard
    bullet point or dash.\r\n\r\nI've always set my bullet points a pt size smaller
    than the text size set with a .1378in tab, but that's me. You can set it anyway
    you like, I don't believe there's a standard form, set in stone when it comes
    to setting bullet points. "

  body: "11, that's not a huge list. Another thing to consider is how compressed your
    list is. Does it make up the majority of the text on the page? Is your page size
    large and would accommodate for more space between bullet points (leading vertically)?
    \r\n\r\nCan you post your current work for us to see what you're working with? "

  body: "I normally try a tab after a circular bullet which is set to half leading
    (so a 10 on 12pt bullet would be indented 6pts), if the first letter in each bullet
    is lowercase it is worth applying some baseline shift to centre it on the x-height,
    some typefaces can look good with a square bullet, in the 10/12 setting a 3.5pt
    square (n in Zapf Dingbats) with baseline shift up, an en-dash can work too but
    with a wider tab (12pt following the 10/12). I avoid the more ornate bullets,
    they seem to add more emphasis than necessary.\r\n\r\nTim"
