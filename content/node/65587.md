body: I work at a printer. I have some files in my shared folder on my mac running
  mac os tigar 11.4. The folders or files say read only in info and me and my boss
  are the only ones that use these files and we can't delete them from our shared
  folder. Neither my boss nor I can delete the folders. I think the clients that we
  got the files from locked them and now they are locked into the shared folder saying
  neither of us have privalages to delete them. Some say read only. What? How do I
  get them outta there? Any advice would be great.
