  body: Changing anything in a font, even its name, often requires a special license,
    depending on the foundry. This would be necessary for Helvetica. I don't know
    Berthold's EULA stipulations.

    license does not allow renaming (as this dilutes trademark protection) and I'd

    you know, this is a bit of a bugbear with me. I repeat: an agreement is an agreement.
    If foundries want to change the terms of their agreements, they can, but once

  body: "In this specific case looking for loopholes or looking at the least restrictive
    license available from a reseller is the wrong approach. Even if the corporation
    is tiny, the fact that they want to distribute customized versions of the fonts
    should dictate that they work with the font owner directly. Even if they find
    a loophole that lets them do this, what happens when they want to do something
    that\u2019s definitely not allowed? What do they do when they need another 500
    licenses and the old EULA has gone away? \r\n\r\nLooking for the best deal or
    EULA is a good approach for personal or limited use, but it doesn't always scale
    at the corporate level. \r\n\r\nSo again find myself on the same page as Tiffany.
    If the vendor is not offering you the licensing rights you need negotiate with
    them, and if you make no progress go elsewhere. Problems occur when designers
    back themselves into a corner on font choice and the vendor isn't flexible - this
    was the case with my company. Until recently a company using Verdana as their
    corporate font had limited legal options if they needed a Type 1 version or a
    modified character or three.\r\n"

  body: "Here's a response to your first question: \r\nHelvetica Neue LIGHT for text?
    How cruel! Is this a government document? \r\n\r\n; )\r\n\r\nI have had the most
    difficulty lately trying to read books set in light weights of Helvetica, and
    I'm not that old. The problem is twofold: Helvetica (as offered digitally) is
    spaced more for display than for text. Any use of any weight of Helvetica below
    12 point requires some positive tracking; letters bleed together, destroying letter
    and word recognition.  Also, Helvetica's lettershapes push the boundary of ambiguity,
    meaning, a, e, s, all look the same, rn = m, and in English, you don't want that
    kind of confusion. The deadly regularity of the strokes combined with the tight
    spacing makes for a singularly unreadable mess. Consider using a better-spaced
    type to start with, like Akzidenz Grotesk! Its proportions and spacing make it
    much more comfortable to read, though smaller sizes might require additional tracking.
    \r\n\r\nI'm sorry, the problem is threefold: Why a light weigh for text? It's
    stylish, I'm well aware, but is it readable? How much text is there? What size
    are you setting all this text? Could you consider a different style of sans, a
    Humanist, for example, to make reading easier and gain some economy of space in
    the bargain? Are you stuck with AG and Helvetica? Several families of <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?query=mundo&pid=403346&page_id=20513&grab_id=0\">Sans</a>
    offer a variety of weights for text and display and are more suited for extended
    reading. I wouldn't recommend any light weight for text sizes. \r\n\r\nNow back
    to regularly scheduled EULA discussion."
