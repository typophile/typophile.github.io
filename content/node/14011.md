  that when you create a letter like lowercase 'b' you can use that letter shape to
  create other letters like lowercase 'd', lowercase 'p' etc...\r\n\r\ni sort of figure
  minor adjustments are necessary in some situations, but i've seen instances where
  the letter is completely flipped or flopped with no adjustment at all. is this common
  practice amongst well established and revered type designers? is flopping a 'b'
  to make a 'd' completely legit? my gut would say no but then i am just a rookie\r\n\r\nany
  advice would be great\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "Speaking as another rookie:\r\n\r\nThe easy way to answer this question is
    to study some well-known fonts. I have just done a test on Univers, where I opened
    the 'd', and copied the 'b' onto its background. I then flipped and shifted the
    background, and got a good match. When I did the same test on Myriad, they did
    not match.\r\n\r\nI think that you will find that fonts which have mirror symmetry
    would normally be classed as 'geometric' or 'constructed', whereas fonts of a
    humanist persuasion do not have mirror symmetry.\r\n\r\nAnother test is to take
    the 'd', copy it onto its own background, and flop it vertically. If you can line
    up the bowls exactly, then it is probably OK to use mirroring to create other
    letters. With most fonts, this test will show that the joins between the bowl
    and the straight are not symmetric about a horizontal axis. The joints on the
    'd' are generally pushed upward. This is the case even when the bowl appears to
    be symmetric. By contrast, the joints on the 'b' are pushed downwards, perhaps
    to the extent that the bottom joint leads into the straight without the straight
    touching the baseline.\r\n\r\nOne technique I think you can safely use, even on
    asymmetric bowls, is to <i>rotate</i> a bowl to form another letter. In a simple
    design, you could start with the 'd', and rotate and shift to form the 'p'. You
    could then take the 'p', and shift its straight upwards to form the 'b', and so
    on. This would make the ascender and descender exactly equal. In may fonts, the
    two are not equal: the descender generally being the shorter. Measure some existing
    fonts to test this.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps."
