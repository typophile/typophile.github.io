  body: "Why use the letter <strong>R</strong> as the basis for the logo? The real
    branding challenge here is that the name of the product says nothing about shoes,
    fashion, or status. The word <em>reel</em> could refer to film, fishing, or the
    unsteady gait of a drunk. \r\nWhy not work on a logo that gives the consumer a
    clue to what the product is?"

    I'm willing to offer suggestions (if I have any) if you'll show us the concepts
    you've developed, but I don't want to do your project for you. Please show us
    your best concepts. Thanks.

    will need to tell the story of Reeler first (with a video, a song, a game, print
    advertisements, etc.), and then use the logo to reinforce the story. \r\n\r\nHere
    are some logos that use a character as the embodiment of their brand. \r\nhttp://nickshell1983.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/l59394.jpg\r\nhttp://popsop.ru/wp-content/uploads/captain-morgan-rum-original-spiced-100-proof_logo.jpg\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nxoNbhOoEOY/UIJUy9SavMI/AAAAAAAAA70/6Ij0qm3q-to/s1600/geico.JPG\r\nhttp://originaltop10.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/wendys-logo.jpg\r\n\r\n(My
    apologies if Reeler is already a well-known character or a real person. I live

    a computer? \r\n\r\nWhen I started studying design, we were asked to produce 100
    sketches in an afternoon. Spend 1-2 mins on an idea, then stop, do a 180\u02DA,
    and move onto a totally different idea. Use big 2' \xD7 3' pad of newsprint. It
    will help you make free-associations between different ideas.\r\n\r\nIf you are
    capable of doing 150, I\u2019m confidant you can do another 150. Keep trying.
    You learn to do by doing."
