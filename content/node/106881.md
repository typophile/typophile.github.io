body: "I was out voted so now I am going as a dog for a Halloween costume party. I
  wanted to spice up the outfit a bit and make into a dirty dog. My hope is to recreate
  a Jack Daniel's label with a dog twist called, Jack Spaniel's. As in a springer
  spaniel. Instead of 80 proof, it will be 80 woof. You get the idea. The bottle will
  be filled with ice tea.\r\n\r\nThere are what I believe to be, six different font
  types on this label. Any help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n1- Every drop. . .\r\n2-
  Sour Mash: Franklin Gothic\r\n3- Whiskey\r\n4- Jack Daniel Distillery: Clarendon
  Bold\r\n5- 40% ALC BY VOL. . .\r\n6- Here at the Jack Daniel. . ."

    label has more of a curve at the end, and the parenthesis is different. '

  body: '1- Monotype Grotesque [MT] Bold Extended -- EXCEPT it looks slightly heavier
    and terminals on the C are not angled as those on the JD label. HOWEVER, I noticed
    Monotype Grotesque [MT] Bold (not extended) has a C like the one on the label.
    Is the JD font an earlier version of Monotype''s or is it another grotesque altogether?
    Why are the C''s terminals differently fashioned for normal and extended? '

    label?
