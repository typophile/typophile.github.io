    Impact, without looking unnatural.

  body: "The really annoying thing is that fonts are often named differently across
    different platforms.  I couldn't tell you how many times I have had problems with
    Helvetica Neue and it not being recognized by photoshop because I had a differently
    named version of it from the creative director.  We finally standardized to the
    Opentype version, which has the same name everywhere (which might help solve your
    problem Dan), but while it went on, it was rather frustrating.\r\n\r\nIf you are
    willing to let go of some control, using font stacks would be a decently good
    idea.  It would allow you to specify which fonts you want to use on windows and
    macs.  It isn't an ideal solution (indeed @font-face would help resolve many an
    issue), but at least it is something that works now.  I'm using it on a site to
    identify Lucida Sans in its Windows version and Mac version (as they are named
    differently).  "

  body: Dan G, start using Univers 59 (as a combination of ttf/otf and eot) if you
    feel like it.  IE6+ supports @font-face but you'll need the use the eot format.  There
    are online tools to do this conversion.  See http://randsco.com/index.php/2009/07/04/p680
    for a some nice CSS to achieve this cross browser.

  body: "Dan, I am going through the same issue.\r\nLinotype is currently offering
    a license extension for the use of Cuf\xF3n, sIFR, Flash and EOT with @font-face.
    They do not permit using TTF or OTF with @font-face, as this would allow anyone
    to download and use the font.\r\nCuf\xF3n transforms the font on a svg, and draws
    it with js. But the generator plus the font file in my case were more than 100ks,
    and the text can not be selected.\r\nsIFR uses flash...\r\nSo I'm trying http://webfonts.fonts.com/
    \ which is pretty cool, but isn't perfect either.\r\nAfter trying all the condensed
    options they offer, I chose Trade Gothic Next Bold Condensed. Unfortunately, Chrome
    and Safari renders the fonts way smaller than Firefox and IE."

  body: "> Unfortunately, Chrome and Safari render[] the fonts way smaller than Firefox
    and IE.\r\n\r\nSo there is that, and the fact that any fall back fonts you define
    for @ff condensed heads, should they be employed, will blow-up your layout; I'd
    start using <em>as graphics</em> whatever font you plan on for condensed (actually
    most web designers are looking to quench a bold condensed thirst), and then...
    if the browsers catch up, you'll be stylistically prepared to start serving a
    live condensed. (None of this is recommended below 18-20 px or in large quantities,
    all of this is recommended for those with stylistic requirements beyond the current
    sizing and rendering barriers of CSS/OS type).\r\n\r\nAnd in the mean time, I
    will see what I can do to give condensed and bold cond. families to everyone in
    the world for free, so sometime in the future, a fall back font won't blow up
    your layouts using condensed. If you want to change the Russian Doll inside this
    issue, lobby IE to support CSS: font-size-adjust. \r\n\r\nJC>We can add this to

    remark now is that the lack of anti-alias on the text in some xp machines complicates
    the use of condensed fonts.\r\nhttp://webfonts.fonts.com/ is a beta service and
    at some point they will begin to charge. But for those like me who need bold condensed
