body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am wondering if anyone else is unhappy with the \"case\" feature...
  (In InDesign it moves glyphs like \"hyphen\", \"emdash\" etc upward when text is
  marked as \"All Caps\" , but it doesn't work when text is directly written in caps
  or capitalized by selecting \"Type/ Change Case\".\r\nI tried to make the case sensitivity
  work whenever caps are in use by including the following lookup in the \"liga\"
  feature. So it is turned on together with the liga feature.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone
  would like to try it or comment it.\r\n\r\n\r\nlookup liga25 {\r\nsub @positionNormal'
  [@uppercaseLetters ] by @positionHigh;\r\nsub @positionNormal' @positionNormal [@uppercaseLetters]
  by @positionHigh;\r\nsub @positionNormal' @positionNormal @positionNormal [@uppercaseLetters]
  by @positionHigh;\r\nsub [@uppercaseLetters @positionHigh] @positionNormal' [@uppercaseLetters
  @positionNormal space] by @positionHigh;\r\n} liga25;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe classes contain:\r\n\r\n@positionNormal:\r\nparenleft,
  parenright, braceleft, braceright, hyphen,\r\nexclamdown, questiondown, endash,
  emdash etc\r\nIN NORMAL POSITION\r\n\r\n@positionHigh:\r\nparenleft, parenright,
  braceleft, braceright, hyphen,\r\nexclamdown, questiondown, endash, emdash etc\r\nIN
  HIGH POSITION\r\n\r\n@uppercaseLetters: all the capital letters"

  body: "The case feature is invoked with the case command (Caps) so that case specific
    punctuation is brought in to play with that command as well. Typing in all caps
    brings no command to bear in opentype since this may bring undesired effects for
    those not so inclined. This does hide the feature as well as [cpsp} capital spacing
    but I don't know how one can go about changing it.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n"

  body: Could there be any undesired effects if case sensitivity in punctuation appears
    whenever text is set in all caps?  js

  body: "If you have acronyms or initials or just capitalized words mixed with all
    lower case the problem comes with how to invoke the case command selectively.
    Even using contextual substitution to place punctuation, you would have it jumping
    up and down in the same sentence.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
