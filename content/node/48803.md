  hoping this group might be able to recommend a typesetter who specializes in Tibetan.
  This is a bilingual edition, with the original texts to be composed in native Tibetan
  script, or Uchen. \r\n\r\nAlso: does anyone have Tibetan font recommendations or
  general information about Tibetan fonts? \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    his PhD and his main focus has been Tibetan. He has done extensive research and
    is also a typographer and designer.\r\n\r\nHis site: http://www.typojo.com/"

    did some font work for them last year (adding Sanskrit transliteration to Garamond
    Premier Pro), and they left me with a very good impression overall. The thing
    is, I'm not sure they set outside stuff.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    pleased so far with the progress we've made. Thanks for the excellent recommendation!
