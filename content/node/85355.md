  body: "Just after a quick glance i feel that the downstroke of A is too heavy. The
    A itself could also be a bit wider. Maybe Z could be wider, too. The N looks a
    bit out of balance? The difference between the two counters is maybe too big.
    Y is too heavy on the left stroke, and the right stroke of V is too thin. Compared
    to M and N the tapering on the baseline of V and W is stronger. S and s lack dynamic
    standing inbetween other characters, for my taste (see daws, e. g.).\r\nGo on,
    great work!"

  body: Jasper, is it possible to see this with the other styles in the Sensato family?
    I'm a bit lost about how it all fits together conceptually and visually.

  body: A few of the glyphs seem to give off the appearance of being angled to the
    right - especially /A/ /w/ and /x/ look like they're leaning a little bit backward.
    I'd reconsider the angled stroke endings in relation to the baseline, maybe a
    shallower angle/bigger overhang would balance it out?

    Sure it is, I'll upload a picture :-)\r\n@Johan: Thank you. Yes, a shallower angle
    is likely to help. I'm not sure if I get you correctly though. \"Angled to the
    right\" and \"leaning a little bit backward\", are to oposites, no?"

    an interpolatable Display variant, namely Sensato E, but I decided to drop that
    for now. I want this thing released. I've been working on it far too long...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_6362.png]\r\n\r\nOhh,
    darn. Sorry for the wide pic -.-"

  body: "\"Angled to the left\", sorry. :o Or, actually, more specifically, rotated
    to the left - to a certain extent it feels as though the whole glyph has simply
    been rotated a few degrees anticlockwise.\r\n\r\nTake the /A/. The slight taper
    on the left leg - and the lack of any other horizontal lines, and the angled right
    leg stroke ending - creates an optical illusion that the stroke ending of the
    left leg that rests on the baseline is actually angled slightly. My eye reads
    the axis of the letter as being the bisector of the angle formed by these two
    lines, as if both were angled equally in relation to the main axis. This bisector
    leans one or two degrees left. Extremely crude illustration of what I mean:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Angle_5499.png]"

    a fresh look at that; you\u2019ll be able to better see those slight imbalances
    that you don\u2019t see now (because of your vision being conditioned)."

  body: The W in particular feels a bit too unbalanced too me. I understand that the
    irregularity of the characters is stressed in such an extreme weight, but the
    forms still need to feel grounded by the baseline.

  body: "Lowercase vertical stems, particularly those that ascend or descend, look
    a touch too dark to me. I would narrow them ever so slightly. \r\nIs /y/ too narrow?\r\n/A/
    could be wider at the top. /K/'s arm looks a touch weak. /S/ may be very slightly
    too light.\r\nAny more narrowing of /W/M/ and maybe /w/m/ you can manage would
    be helpful.\r\n"

  body: "Hi again Jasper :)\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things that strike me, but
    take with plenty of salt of course:\r\n\r\nG: perhaps the stem is too light? \r\nK:
    Something bugs me about it, perhaps it's what Craig just said about the top arm.
    Or maybe I'd bring the connection a tiny bit closer to the stem.\r\nM and W: agree
    with Craig.\r\nDiagonals (UC and lc) are rather lively with all their terminals.
    How do they work in text?\r\np and q look to have descenders longer than the ascenders
    of b and d. \r\nI was also going to comment about the A and a, but someone else
    mentioned those and it looks better now.\r\nX and x: I'd offset the upstroke more,
    only because of personal preference. Cap VWX seem to me to be falling right, but
    that could be my eyesight!\r\n\r\nI'd love to see a pdf with the regular and black
    alphabets (UC and lc) compared. If you don't want to post a pdf here, I'd be happy
    to receive it by e-mail, if you'd like further observations.\r\n\r\nThis is going
    to be a very interesting and attractive family."

  body: "@Craig: Noted and being worked on :-) I can't manage any more narrowing in
    /W/M/w/m/ without making them look too dark. Sorry ;-P\r\n\r\n@Ben: The stem in
    G is indeed too light. The problem is that the inner shape and width of the G
    has to stay balanced. I'll work on it...\r\n\r\nRegarding the long descenders,
    you might want to check out this: http://www.typophile.com/node/85601\r\n\r\nVWXx
    look fine to me...\r\n\r\nI'll upload a pdf with the next update :-)\r\n\r\nThanks

    want to be able to use this lovely face you know! Also, do you think the break
    in the 'P' is working on the black?
