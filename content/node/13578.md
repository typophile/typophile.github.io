  design degree. I don't want be spending loads on it in case i don't take to it.
  I was just wondered if anyone had any good opinions on wether they'r worth buying
  and any brands that are particularly good. I'd be using it with programs like quark
  xpress, adobe illustrator and photoshop.\r\n\r\nany comments would be a great help\r\n\r\nthanks

    solution. They have multiple sizes and price points, so there should be something
    that would fit your need. Check out there site: http://wacom.com/index2.cfm\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps."

    body: yes thankyou, iv seen a wacom one that i quite like and i'd read that they'r
      worth paying a little bit more for than some cheaper alternatives. the a6 size
      (active) doesn't seem very big but as iv never used one before i wouldn't know
      just how big you can work well with?

    me from repetitive stress syndrome.\r\nThe 8\" x 6\" is big enough.\r\nThe new
    fat styluses really suck, get the skinniest they have."

  body: "I have a 9 x 12 at work and I have to restrict the area that is active because
    of the size. Here at home I have a 6 x 8. That seems to be just fine. If you can
    afford it definitely get the Intuos line. The pressure sensitivity is worth the
    extra money. I agree with Mr. Shinn. I originally got one because I was getting
    carpel tunnel syndrome from the mouse. The Wacom solved that\u2026\r\npeace"

  body: "I've got a 6 x 8 Intuos from Wacom and I love it. And I actually prefer the
    new fat stylus to the older, thinner versions, but I guess that just comes down
    to personal preference.\r\n\r\nOne other thing, RSI-wise: the only problem I have
    with the size of the tablet is that it means mousing or tableting way over to
    the side of the keyboard, which is harmful in its own right. I ended up getting
    myself a special split keyboard that doesn't have a 10-key area, so that the tablet
    could be more directly in front of me."

  body: "Alison:\r\n\r\nMy advice is to buy an inexpensive small but very efficient
    tablet like Wacom Volito 2. This way you can try it out without spending to much
    money and figure out what are specifically your needs on a tablet. Later on you
    can buy a professional tablet. Maybe this works for you. It works for me (right
    now I need a scroll on my tablet pen lol)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPedro\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\r\n<a
