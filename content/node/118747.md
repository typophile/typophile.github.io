  body: "A better sample might help. Your sample resolution is so low that even the
    same letters/digits look different.\r\nSome more info the sample origin, it could
    also be helpful. If e.g. this is a printed material, it could correspond to an
    embedded printer font and there is no point to search for an exact match in a
    modern OTF/TTF font - but only an equivalent."
