body: "A while back [[Jim Rimmer]] asked if I would scan a few pages of his book,
  \u201CLeaves from the Pie Tree\u201D. It is a beautiful letterpress book is printed
  on fine paper and hand bound by Jim in limited edition. It is available from [[P22]]
  and from Jim\u2019s own foundry. The types are all Jims own hot metal cuts. I have
  posted a PDF of the pages I scanned so that you can see them at higher than screen
  resolution. There was a thread here on Typophile a while back which prompted this
  post.\r\n\r\nOne of the featured faces is used to set a story his father told him
  as a boy.  The following is a note from Jim.\r\n\r\n\u201CNephi Mediaeval was my
  attempt to make a type heavily reflective of the semi roman of Sweynheim and Pannartz,
  without making an out and out revival of it.  I studied the characters of the original
  pretty thoroughly and then put them away before starting my own drawings. I did
  refer back to the originals a couple of times and cheated a little, making alterations
  where I had drifted too far away from the look of the S&P type.\r\n\r\nI cut this
  type in one size only (18 point) since I believed at the time that this was close
  to the historic type. I named my version after my dad, John, Nephi Rimmer. It has
  had little use because of the restrictive nature of such an archaic design, but
  I was able to use it this year in my putting down in words, a story often told to
  me by my dad from his early memories of boyhood in Bolton, Lancashire.\u201D\r\n\r\nJim

  body: "Sharon,\r\nI just downloaded it from the link with no problem. What version
    of Acrobat are you using? Perhaps you need to u[grade to a more current reader?
    This one is saved as 6.0.\r\nIt is 30MB so you can zoom in on the detail. Perhaps
    you have a size restriction for download?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    itself. The black page was a rice paper printed with metalic sulver ink. The scan
    does not show it at its best light.\r\nThe photo of the stone was tipped in the
    book but shows you Jim's handiwork with a chisel as well.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
