body: "I have a query on how the cmap table works with glyph ID which I'm hoping somebody
  can shed some light upon:\r\n\r\nAre glyph ID number font specific, or encoding
  specific? \r\n\r\nFor example, I have a font which I am working on and the 'ydiresis'
  glyph has a glyph ID '203'. I checked this against the Georgia font on my operating
  system, and here the 'ydiresis' glyph has a glyph ID '185'.\r\n\r\nAs long as the
  cmap table is correctly defined, would this function properly on older apps/os,
  or do glyph ID's have to conform to an encoding (and then this has to be specified
  in the cmap table)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
