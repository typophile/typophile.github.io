    body: Thanks Mike, you got it. Unhappily, Whitman is released without a bold italic,
      unlike Celeste, a close match I already have. Looks great on coated stock, though.
      Also, it looks like Joanna without its disastrous mis-matched italic. Need to
      go to MyFonts.com to see a clear breakdown of what's available and for how much;
      Font Bureau's website doesn't sell anything very well.

    body: Miss Tiff, do you mean they will break down and offer a bold italic, as
      was eventually offered for Scala and Scala Sans?? How they love to torment us
      by waiting and then charging so much more for that one missing font!! A pox
      on such foundries!

  body: I heard a rumor -- from a very good source -- that Whitman is being updated.
    Wish I could give more than that. Sorry.
