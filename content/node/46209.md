body: "This has been troubling me big time. This is a font, it is customized for the
  log, but as seen on the quote it is also used as text. I've tried recreating it
  in illustrator for the logo, but it would be crazy to recreate all the font for
  fill texts. Someone has suggested ITC Klepto, it't near but not quite, this one
  is more simple. Anyone has a clue?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2dd477c5ea9a5416584dd80636064af9_3465.18744.jpeg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/b1dd3ea3b40420cff846b7dc24ec3892_6635.53877.jpeg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/9d1f4632df2c1740dffd85eb3679dc21_6017.6477.jpeg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1da93bc1a53e9231c52c348a5c032170_6652.163037.jpeg]"

    put together just to have something. But it would be much easier and much nicer
    if I had the font to just adjust it to the logo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lacaridad_5329.gif]"

    the font you're looking for, this may be a good replacement;\r\n\r\nShag Mystery
    or Shag lounge (part of the same set) by House Industries.  It has some similar
    swashes & other extras you might need.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=22\r\n\r\nGood
    luck\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "Hey thanks for the reply,\r\n\r\nNice suggestions but I actually think that
    Shag Exotica would be a nicer approach, as it is a kind of mix between this look
    and the original look of the play:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sweet_charity_1966_a_5151.JPG]\r\n\r\nI
    am still experimenting on finding a good look for this, but I've had a lot of
    troubles on finding a font that fits, so any suggestions are welcome."
