body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am currently designing a poster for a play which is set in
  1832 London (pre-victorian period). \r\n\r\nDoes anyones know of any interesting
  and accessible typefaces I could use. I have already experimented some standards
  such as Baskerville, Garamond, Caslon and Plantin. I'm looking for more of an interesting
  typeface then the ones mentioned \u2013 more decorative and expressive if poss.
  \r\n\r\nAny ideas???\r\n\r\nThanks, James"
