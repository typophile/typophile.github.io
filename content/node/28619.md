  body: It's very close to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cartel/">Cartel</a>
    but some details don't match and the middle lines are a bolder weight than any
    of the Cartel family.

  body: "Whenever I hear about bolder weights, I think of the FontBank collection.
    <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/rillo.htm\">Rillo Heavy</a>
    is exactly the right weight, I think. The middle part of this sample was made
    by stretching the height to 110%. The bottom two lines were lightened by adding
    white stroke, which created the pseudo ink-trap look in the N.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TenaciousDSIM_6542.gif]"
