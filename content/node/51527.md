  I will be starting off at home and then seeing how it goes and will decide to take
  it to a bigger level. Keeping in mind the present scenario, web designing and internet
  based business are proving to be one of the most profitable businesses, but having
  said that it\u2019s important here to deliver the best. I just want to get as much
  information as I can and tips before really getting into it. I am planning to start
  with one or two small projects and then thinking of expanding my business when having
  enough of work and resource. What do you people think on that? \r\n"

  body: "I opened an Internet Web hosting and design/support business in 1996 when
    it was rare to find someone who could spell Internet, much less know how to deal
    with it. We were profitable until we sold the business early this year. However,
    \"profitable\" can be misleading. We had a dedicated server which was a fixed
    monthly cost. The only other direct charge was our ISP support. It was a home
    business, so there was no rent. In other words, what was left over was \"profit,\"
    and it kept food on the plate and lights on in the house. We had 200 hosting accounts
    at one point.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, your competition is not the guy down the street
    offering the same services you are, it's outfits like GoDaddy and 1and1 who offer
    hosting and page design software on the cheap, so you services are no longer required--at
    least for the brochure-type sites.\r\n\r\nThink about the added dimension of offering
    a full marketing package, of which the Web is only a part. This sort of service,
    if developed and pitched well, falls more into the advertising arena than into
    simple Web design work, and the money is significantly better. \r\n\r\nCurt Akin"

    specifically about type, typography, font making or fonts, neither is it specifically

    and can't take any practical measures against it, but I draw your attention to
    the basic facts of the matter. This is a typography forum, dude, not a web design
    or a business forum. Please, if you don't mind.\r\n\r\nPlease. Thread topic relevance

  body: "James, the success of an online community depends on the quality of the members
    moreso than heavy-handed topic policing. The fact that you are in a forum labeled
    GENERAL DISCUSSIONS and ANYTHING GOES makes your argument kind of weak. Ultimately,
    good forums HAVE a 'general' area to keep people like you happy by not cluttering
    up the more narrow topic areas.\r\n\r\nBut, anyways, this is a spam post, so it
    should be deleted."

    on other forums by someone who just signed up.\r\n\r\nThere's a slim chance that
    it could just be a very naive and annoying person actually personally asking this
    question all over the internet, but more likely it's an SEO farm testing phrases.
    There's been a lot of this going on lately. They'll come into a forum and post
    a semi-grammatically correct post that relates somewhat to the forum. They then
    do this multiple times all over the internet to track SEO stuff.\r\n\r\nVery annoying."

    it\u2019s easy to do some small projects on own and then after having a market
    position, you look out to expand. Web designers are in demand as maximum of business
    owners are attracted towards internet. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to capitalize
    on this. I came across a good information package called [url=http://www.2ono.com/web-Design-Business.html]web
    design business startup kit [/url]. It will teach you how to start a web design
    business, How to build a profitable web design business and run it from home or
    an outside facility, finding clients offline and online and tips and ideas for
    promotion. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "well, spam or no spam, I got to read about Curt's business and it made me
    think.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing Curt!\r\n\r\nSo as a designer who might make
    their money from internet hosting, the main product you'd be selling them is the
    design, and try as much as you can to bring that out of the browser, onto paper
    and other things, because that's value that big hosting companies don't offer,
    thus giving you the competitive edge?\r\n\r\nI think a lot of it is like eBay
    too, market makes a difference, tell a story, look into it and find out why it's
    valuable and you'll do a better job of selling it.\r\n\r\nFor Curt or others:
    How hard would it be to start a hosting service, and would that possibly be a
    good idea for a freelance designer, to give them a more stable income flow month-to-month
    while their contracts get shuffled around?"

  body: "Most of our customers absolutely resisted a high-end design. It was a hard
    sell to convince them that a good design would really have a return on the investment--often
    it is simply not true <g>\r\n\r\nStarting a hosting service is really fairly simple.
    Get a dedicated or managed server somewhere, figure what is a competitive monthly/yearly
    fee for hosting clients, and go for it. I recommend not using a shared server;
    dedicated/managed gives you absolute total control over what you can offer. We
    charged $14.95/month per hosting account and paid $69.95/month for a dedicated
    server.\r\n\r\nYour best bet for new clients is to watch for new business announcements
    or pound the pavements. Be particularly on the lookout for the really new who
    have no brand identity, no printed material, no Web presence. The Web site design
    and hosting may be your foot in the door and may result in a complete brand development.\r\n\r\nAlways
    keep in mind the economic state of the USA at this point, and don't scare a new
    client with the whole package price. A small piece here and there can be developed
    over time.\r\n\r\nCurt Akin"
