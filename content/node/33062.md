  body: "Very, nice Nick! \r\n\r\nBy the way, I love the name of the reporter, 'Erin
    Kobayashi'. It's one of those names which makes you want to sing 'Its a small
    world after all'--providing there is no one around to kill you for singing it!"

  body: "Well, we can't let the H font get all the ink.\r\nAnd a little sex usually
    manages to turn heads.\r\nI thought it was a pretty good general interest type
    article. Resulting from sending out a press release for the Softmachine launch
    (although no reporters attended the party).\r\nThe timing was fortuitous, as they
    ran it beside an article on the H font's birthday and film showing in the Toronto
    Hot Docs film fest. You know how the media likes to show balance, so it's great
    to be the new local and sexy alternative to the H font.\r\n\r\nFunny that the
    online article is illustrated with a still from the H movie -- they actually sent
    a photographer for the interview, and his shot was in the newspaper article. Go
    figure.\r\n\r\n"
