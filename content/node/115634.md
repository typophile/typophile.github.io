  creative for their running magazine. I'd like to suggest some contemporary fonts
  for the design that reflect both the physical aspect of running as well as the more
  cerebral nature of the sport.\r\n\r\nI thought I'd ask to see if anyone had any
  suggestions to help get me started? The readership is quite broad, with a good proportion
  of male and female readers across all ages. I'm really open at this stage to any
  and all thoughts\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: How about using a monowidth in some part of the design, to signify the even
    pace of distance running?

  body: "I have some ideas, but it would be very useful to have more details, especially
    concerning the illustration/photography style, as well as the typical length of
    the articles.\r\n\r\nNick, interesting idea, but I in practice I think it would
    instead convey the sort of running that a drunk person would do. :-)  A better
    way to express a constant pace might be using a Didone. But: low readability.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Sorry what's a monowidth?\r\nMy thoughts are to have edgy, contemporary illustration
    styles using loose, hand drawn elements perhaps with collage to show anything
    that needs to be a bit scientific. The stretches and technique illos will need
    to be clearer, but I'm hoping to use someone who creates line art and then adds
    rough textures and colour panels to break up the shape of the body.\r\nFor photography,
    I'd like to try and showcase aspects rarely touched on, so rather than the guy
    breaking the tape at the finish, perhaps focus on the guys just behind and drop
    the focus on the winner to show the determination and hopefully put the 'reader
    in the image'. I'd like a mix of mono and colour images and I'd thinking of recommending
    photographers who don't normally shoot sporting images and try and get some atmosphere
    into the shots.\r\nI gather articles are roughly 6 pages and about 500 words per
    page (A4). But they like to open on a big image and lessen the type, so I reckon
    perhaps 700 per page is more realistic plus boxouts - busy but plenty of breathing
    space.\r\nDidone (I looked at H&F's) looks lovely I just wonder whether it's too
    'now' and doesn't convey the technical aspects? It could work for those feature
    headers needing to feel epic though.\r\nPresent thoughts are Farnham/Miller/Mercury
    with Verlag/Neutraface or Whitney - just might be a bit too obvious and besides
    everyone is using that setup\u2026\r\n\r\n"
