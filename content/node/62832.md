    try to make your titles descriptive. Some folks specialize in certain font styles,
    so the right words can get you the right help even quicker.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Jan, I think you are right, although I had to look hard at both samples to
    see the differences. Superficially they are quite similar, and I thought just
    spacing and some height/width tweaking was involved, but I can see that the 'r'
    shape difference couldn't be changed by graphic manipulation. \r\n\r\nSo the question
    still is, what is it? I seem to recall a recent font with a similar 'g', but where
    did I see it?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    identification as you have for serifs, Mike. ;-)"

    has a g like that (and round i-dots) but the rest isn\u2019t there. And there
    is <a href=\"http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/11617?text=Legal+Services\">M+
    2p</a> which is similar, too. But no cigar either."
