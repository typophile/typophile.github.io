  body: "Usually this sort of trademark lettering is custom work, not a font. It is
    a simplification of Old English, I would say, designed to make the lettering easier
    to read, and to look more modern than the original Blackletter type.\r\n\r\n-

  body: I agree with Mike. Lots of Belgian beer logos are handlettered. Check out
