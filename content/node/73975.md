  body: "\"1\u201310 mm\".\r\n\r\nThe en-dash is used in its \"range\" context, and
    the space between value and unit is mandatory per SI specifications.\r\n\r\nAm
    exception is degrees Celsius: \"10\u201320\xB0C\", no space (and it's not <em>really</em>
    an exception, because degrees Celsius are not an SI unit).\r\n\r\n(I have to admit
    I don't know the rules for negative numbers; \u221210\u2013\u22125\xB0C looks
    weird, with alternating minus and en-dash. Fortunately, values in mm are usually
    not in the negative range.)"

    space character, or empirical space?\r\nBecause some fonts have copious sidebearings
    on their dashes, others do not.\r\nSo some discretion on the part of the typographer
    is necessary."

    too. You don't want \"8\r\nmm\" across a line end :-)"

    \r\n\r\nFor clarity, I'd probably say \"\u221210 to \u22125\xB0C\" .\r\n\r\n\r\n>
    [the space] would need to be non-breaking\r\n\r\nYeah, I'd just adjust the space
    between the characters via kerning."

  body: With negatives, definitely what James said. No need to create visual confusion
    by having en dashes and minuses in close proximity if there's a reasonable alternative.
