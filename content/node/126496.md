    body: okay but I asked as mostly available users are concerned with fonts, so
      I think you also knew the way to help me out. But thanks for advice I will look
      for a spreadsheet forum too.

  body: "I do not know either how to install fonts onto a Linux system, since my only
    computer with a GUI runs MS Windows. I think, however, that there is a font installer
    application available, maybe inside the font viewer, as shown below:\r\n\r\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/18357/how-to-install-otf-fonts"
