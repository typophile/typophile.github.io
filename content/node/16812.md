  i should place an oversized, pale quotation mark on the beginning of each font,
  tpo make it more obvious that it's actually a \"spoken word quote\". but there's
  something in my brain stem that tells me this could look really tacky. What do you
  guys think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quote.gif]"

    The heavy modern can be comic.\r\n2. It's backwards to me. Use an opening quote."

  body: "I've seen this several times in brochures, where customer testimonials are
    inserted into the text. It can work well. Might even be better in your case, where
    the quotations are longer stretches of text.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note on your
    sample though... the mark you're using is a closing quotation mark and you have
    it at the beginning of your text. Was this intentional? Seems counter-intuitive
    to me.\r\n\r\n<em>Edit: Stephen beat me to that one!</em>"

  body: Not all languages use the same quotation marks. The opening quotes for some
    languages, such as German, are "low-9" quotes. They are paired with the raised
    6-shaped quotes on the right (which are the same as the English-style opening
    quotes). See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark">Wikipedia
    article</a>. I know they use these in Icelandic, so I'm guessing this is the convention
    in Norwegian as well.

  body: "Gotcha! Besserwissers! ;)\r\n\r\nDear Stephen and Engel, I would bet that
    the text in Mr. Fjelldal\u2019s book is Norwegian, Danish or Icelandic. I assume
    that just like in Finnish and Swedish, the opening quote looks just like the closing
    quote, which led to your mild errors. So go on, Alex.\r\n\r\nYour majesty, your
    royal highness, dear guests and\u2026 No?\r\n\r\nEdit: I guess I should recheck
    the conversation before posting\u2026"

    correcting me, Alexander and Lari.\r\n\r\nObviously, I haven't done much non-English
    work! I knew other languages/cultures had different marks for quotations (ie.
    chevrons, corner brackets). But I didn't realize there were others that used the
    same style marks in a different configuration. \r\n\r\nWell then, Alexander (Fjelldal),
    carry on!"

      In German, yes, but not in French. Are there any examples one could point at?
      I'd be much obliged."

  body: If you use over sized quotes investigate printing them about 10% tint of gray
    or of the PMS color you choose. Why pull attention away from the actual quote?

  body: I'm on the fence. I've seen this in bad textbook design, though, so maybe
    I'm off on a bad foot. Second Dan on the light screen or PMS, although a trap
    to the PMS could make a mess. Look at the line screen as well. If it is high and
    you think the printer can do a light tone screen do it. What's the paper?

  body: "Man, this forum is so great! thanks for all the answers. for the record:
    the first lines say \"Your majesty, your royal highness, dear guests and honorable
    fellow members of parliament\". That's 3 points out of 4 for you, Grotesque. \r\n\r\nI
    think the problem with the quotation mark i've used, is that it's too round and
    comic, and i don't want people to see '66' or'99'. anyone got a tip for a '<strong>\xAB</strong>'
    i could use?"
