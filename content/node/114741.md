  anybody recognise this font? Can you identify it? I've tried WhatTheFont and Identifont,
  but no luck. The Presets are a very successful electronic dance duo. They're avant-garde
  Australians who come from Sydney and have been around since 2003 and made such big
  hits like Girl And The Sea, My People, This Boy's In Love, Talk Like That, If I
  Know You, and Ghosts. Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes were students at The Sydney
  Conservatorium of Music, where they first met in 1995. This has always been their
  logo since 2003, if not earlier. I've found no information about the font used in
  the logo, and I've seen no words/characters other than those shown here that have
  been used by anybody or even the duo, which makes me think this may haven't been
  made into a font? Is there any way to know who made this font? The font The Presets
  use on their albums' covers and tour tickets is OCR-A Regular, by Veronika Elsner
  and G\xFCnther Flake (Elsner+Flake), which is considerably more readable. Can anybody
  identify this?"
