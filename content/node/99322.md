  everybody, I found this great logo and i was wondering if anyone can recognize the
  font. I thought at first it was Verve, but it is not. It's more geometric than verve.
  If anyone can help out I'd really apreciate it!\r\nThanks!"

      it a bit, but freak out bananas is about as good as it gets.\r\n"
