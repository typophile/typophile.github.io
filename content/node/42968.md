body: The kra has only a lowercase form in old Greenlandic, and is deprecated in modern
  Greenlandic in favor of the q, but, if the kra had an uppercase form, what would
  it look like, and how would it be distinguished from the K?

  body: "Interesting that in that pdf file, Everson has a proposed LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
    KRA glyph that looks like K\u2019, not K\u02BB as in his <em>other</em> pdf file.\r\n\r\nThis
    is an encoding issue, as I see it. An argument can be made for treating the uppercase
    Kra as a single glyph with its own code value, as the pdf proposes. Even if it
    means double-encoding as either a single glyph or as a combination of glyphs.
    I'll let the unicode experts decide."
