body: I&#39;m having trouble with the upper and lowercase w in Adobe Univers 45 light
  italic. The finishing stroke is cut off in both cases. When I look at the glyphs
  in Fontographer 4.1 I can see that the character space is too small, which is easy
  to fix. But after I do the fix I don&#39;t know how to relate the new font back
  to the Univers font family &#40;this used to be easy in FontMonger&#41; and at the
  print shop it defaults to 45 bold italic. It can be changed back but still... This
  is on a machine running Windows 2000 Professional &#40;no, they&#39;re not buying
  me a Mac so save that suggestion&#41;, Type Manager 4.1. The problem appears in
  the ATM font preview and in any program I run. Any suggestions?

  body: Continuing my monologue--I guess as an existential exercise--I have found
    that the font prints and displays properly with Windows 98 and ATM 4.0 but not
    in Win 2000 or XP. I guess as an older font it just doesn&#39;t work with the
    new platforms &#40;oddly, all the other weights and styles are fine&#41;. I&#39;m
    not a huge Univers fan, but it looked best for this job. But I may just have to
    use something else.
