body: "Hi, \r\nI am looking for a specific font, and it says in the guidelines to
  ask here.\r\n\r\nThere is a font from Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast Trilogy that I
  am having a hard time identifing. It seems close to TheAntiquaSun and in some aspects,
  Leipziger Antiqua.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/textsamplegormenghastrawd3_4275.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  biggest indicator that it is different from any other font I've found are the commas
  and the apostrophes. In AntiquaSun, the commas and quote marks are curved - like
  most fonts. In the text sampled above, the commas are straight, almost like a stroke
  from a painter's brush. They are dashes, or teardrops. \r\n\r\nThe letters above
  are \"sharper\" too (i.e look at letters \"y\" and \"c\") but are not coarsely angular
  like the Leipziger. For instance, the tail in the letter \"y\" ends in a straight
  manner. In AntiquaSun, the end of \"y\" is curved.\r\n\r\nThe Gormenghast book version
  is from Vintage.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can enlighten me as to what font this is, I would
  be most appreciative.\r\n\r\nSpix."

  body: "No, not Meridien, the serifs on the lower case 'd' on this sample go up to
    the left. The tail on the lowercase 'e' is too short and it's counter is much
    too small. \r\n\r\nDo yo know what year it was published? This would help you
    determine what it couldn't be. "
