  body: "Your contexts are different, but second one is more detailed version of the
    first. Rules in a single lookup are tested in order they appear in project. If
    some rule matches context, specified action is executed and following rules are
    skipped. Because of that, rules setting more detailed context should be placed
    in front of others. For example, if your font contains ff and ffi ligatres, ffi
    should be listed first to work correctly. In your case, you should reorder markc\\PositioningB
    before markc\\PositioningA.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n"
