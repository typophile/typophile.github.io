body: In New York City in the '70s, I owned a tiny cold type company called Intertypographics.
  There was a guy, whose name I don't remember, who was not an employee, but used
  to hang around a lot because he was a typophile. Both he and I are African American.
  He would be about 50 by now. If he happens to be reading this, or anyone who thinks
  he might know him happens to be reading this, it would be great to make contact
  and find out what he's been doing for the last 35 years. The are other identifying
  details I could mention if someone things he knows him.

    went to High School in Brooklyn, and college in Greenwich Village.\r\n\r\nI left
    NYC in 1970 but hung around with many design students up until that point. Do
    you have any clues? School? Where did he live? C'mon, dig into your old memory
    cells.\r\n\r\nI have been tracked down recently by an old neighborhood friend,
    and I have chased down a few old friends here and there."

    Norbert, that book will give you some great ideas about how to make\r\ntypographic

    in this field.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
