body: "Hi.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to figure out how to expand the letterspacing in a typeface
  i'm working on. Currently the color of the font is pretty good, but it needs to
  be a bit wider spaced for legibility. I thought this would be a fairly simple procedure,
  but so far books, manuals and googling have not come up with anything.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nS."
