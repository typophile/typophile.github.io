  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Washington, USA--The Office of Homeland Security announced today that it has denied entry visas to two suspected &#34;Typoterrorists,&#34; Yuri Yarmola of Russia and Adam Twardoch a Polish national said to be domiciled in Berlin, both belonging to a subversive organization known as &#34;Font Lab.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;We have solid information,&#34; said Attorney General John Ashcroft, &#34;that this Font Lab has been amassing huge quantities of yellow cake &#40;with chocolate frosting&#41; along with gallons of Borsht, which if left unrefridgerated for a few days, is capable of producing biological agents.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;In addition,&#34; Ashcroft said during closed prayer meetings with choir boys,&#34; we&#39;ve received &#34;hints&#34; that this tightly kerned terrorist font cell known as &#39;The Metrics&#34; had attended font schools in the United States asking to be taught how to handle fonts, but not how to land them.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Commenting on the case at an emergency press conference, President Bush stated, &#34;We know that this Font Lab was close to developing Weapons of Font Instruction. How do we know it? Because we just do! Because I said so! Well for one thing the terrorists Yarmola and Twardoch don&#39;t own oil companies and they aren&#39;t millionaires and their names sound...unusually  <BR>suspicious and unAmerican. Secondly, I&#39;m pretty sure that the words Type and Terrorism both start with the letter &#39;T&#39; and that&#39;s all the proof I need.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Yarmola had previously been admitted to the US where he attended a Type conference and was spotted taking dozens of Spy photos of conference participants. Twardoch, a contributor to the just-published book, Learn FontLab Fast, a purported &#34;underground typoterrorism manifesto,&#34; was apprehended in 1989 attempting to board a plane with a kielbasa hidden in his shoe.  <BR> <BR>Attendees at this year&#39;s TypeCon were shocked and dismayed to learn that Yarmola and Twardoch would not be attending. &#34;We saw them as valuable members of our type community and little suspected that they had the insidious intention of destroying our American way of type.&#34; said Franklin Helvetica a decent, American typographer. &#34;I am sure,&#34; said Clarendon Baskerville, &#34;that this development will give an edge to this year&#39;s ATypI type conference in Prague, where an increasingly regressive and draconian justice system such as ours does not exist.&#34;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, while I share your opinion on this matter and Leslie&#39;s indignation, I don&#39;t think this post is a good idea. Thanks to this thread, Yuri and Adam&#39;s names will now be indexed on search engines and show up in Google et al linked to terrorism, Homeland Security, etc. <BR> <BR>A respected educator and ATypI member was dismayed to discover that his name showed up in an archived ATypI Rome newsletter satire in which he is described as being arrested for the names on Roman statues to Greek. Funny at the time perhaps, but not when he had to explain to prospective students that no, he has not been in trouble with the law in Italy. <BR> <BR>I suggest that you ask the Typophile guys to remove this thread.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Also, Google will show up their names linked with yellow cake. And Borst. Not to mention John Hudson. Of course, those that <i>read</i> the article after finding it on Google would, presumably, notice that its a satire. <BR> <BR>It would have perhaps been wise to check with them first before posting &#40;assuming they did not&#41;, but I think I&#39;d like to hear Mr Yarmola and Mr Twardoch opinion on the satire and whether it should be removed? <BR> <BR>Satire and parody hold an important position in many of our cultures for dissent and commentary, one I would not like to see disappear for fear of stupid people not realising that yellow cake and chocolate frosting is a somewhat unlikely WMD.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Leslie &amp; Tiffany, I find this very entertaining. This did cheer me up, as did the fact that I was fortunately able to give some &#34;virtual&#34; talks at Fontlab Ltd.&#39;s workshops at TypeCon, yesterday and today.  <BR> <BR>&#40;I joined in over <a href="http://www.webex.com/">WebEx</a>, a commercial online conferencing system that I must say I&#39;m quite impressed with despite a few glitches.&#41;  <BR> <BR>I definitely don&#39;t mind the story written by Leslie! But to clarify: I was not denied a visa but was rather victim to excessive bureaucracy that effectively prohibited me from applying for a visa in the first place. I <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/33767.html#POST68275">described it in more detail</a> for those interested. Yuri did not even plan to go to TypeCon this time, BTW. But I definitely don&#39;t mind Leslie&#39;s and Tiffany&#39;s poetic license!  <BR> <BR>Unlike my non-existent terrorist links, I do confess that it was me who commited that satire piece about the &#34;respected educator and ATypI member&#34; who was arrested for changing the names on Roman statues to Greek. Damn it, it&#39;s <a href="http://www.atypi.org/30_past_conferences/10_Rome_2002/news_html?newsid=35">still online</a>. Sorry Gerry! :&#62; I really hope that the story depicted there is so absurd that nobody would believe it! In particular, prospective type designers who want to study in Reading. BTW -- when I spoke to Gerry, the only thing he complained about was that I referred to him as &#34;scholar&#34; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam <BR> <BR> <BR></div>
