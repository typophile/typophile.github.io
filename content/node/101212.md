    wouldn't be the first time Joe has tried to impose a fascist view of typography

    And for the record, I frequently see American English words used on the internet

    do know how to spell, if nothing else."

  body: "John, I did notice it was a pretty high-compression JPEG (from the cruddy
    white-on-gray text on the left) but I'm assuming that can be reproduced reliably
    enough to be able to reverse-engineer it.\r\n\r\nGeorge, thanks for that - interesting.\r\n\r\nJustin,
    some offensive/incriminating (live) content has been removed since the screengrabs
    were made, and some people are hoping to salvage the reputation of a certain (minor)
    political aspirant by casting doubt on the authenticity of the screengrabs. My
    image above judiciously avoids the offending passage.\r\n\r\nThe more interesting
    aspect of this story BTW is that apparently this person's YouTube account was
    an anonymous one when the alleged offensive comments were made, but some time
    after Google acquired YouTube he decided to link the two accounts... not realizing
    that would cause all his old YouTube comments to get a real name! :-/  I wonder
    if somebody will sue somebody for that \"privacy violation\". Check that: I wonder
    <em>when</em> somebody will sue somebody for that \"privacy violation\". I personally
    don't think anonymous people should have privacy rights - that's like eating your
    cake and having it too.\r\n\r\nSo the moral of the story might be: Don't make
    anonymous comments - it's better to face the consequences of your desire to express
    your controversial opinions immediately... Or an even a better one: Don't run
    for public office because even if you did nothing wrong Democracy will make you
    pay.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    like taking proactive steps to be private. Are you saying that a right to freedom
    of movement should only be had by people who don't move?\r\n\r\nNow, I happen
    to think that being anonymous on, say, Typophile, is lame, but there are plenty
    of places in the world in which anonymity or pseuodonymity is a matter of personal
    safety, and is a necessity in part because privacy rights are abused or denied.
    And as the Google/YouTube account linking debacle shows, there may be good reason
    to be anonymous even in places where you don't think what you say might get you
    into trouble."

    -if it <em>is</em> a doctored screengrab- they used Photoshop, which produces

    the pixel patterns and glyph widths/alignment. I would imagine that jpeg compression
    could account for the overall desaturation and other color artifacts. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>On
    the other hand it's pretty easy to change the original HTML and get a bona fide

    be the way to go if one were trying to create a fake screenshot of a website.
    Any site's content can easily be altered right inside the browser using built-in
    developer tools or extensions like Firebug\u2014no Photoshop required\u2014and
    result in something indistinguishable from the real thing."
