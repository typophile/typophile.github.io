  anyone help me with identifying this typeface pleaseeee?\r\n\r\nI have recently
  started a new job and I am trying to develop their Corporate Guidelines, however,
  no one seems to know what typeface is used in their logo!\r\n\r\nIt may be based
  on an existing typeface and has been edited for the logotype but any help would
  be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nSam"

    does that copyright mean it should not be in use?\r\n\r\nRyuk \u2013 brilliant
    references, I will have a good look through, thankyou."

  body: As this 'NatWest' is all over [[http://www.natwest.com|their actual website]],
    we could be not so hazardous to conclude this typeface still remains exclusive
    for National Westminster Bank and can't be purchased or used for any other purpose
    than NWB's.

    Natwest Text as a 'free font' are doing so unlawfully? Or that it should be used
    for noncommerical use only?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help."

    a free font so any source offering it as a 'free font' does it illegally.\r\n<blockquote>Or
    that it should be used for non commercial use only?</blockquote>\r\nI'm not a
    law expert but to me, it's crystal clear. Part for/by National Westminster Bank,
    it can't be used and that includes all non-commercial/personal purposes."

  body: I don't completely get the point why it have to be this font but you could
    use [[http://www.whatfontis.com|WhatFontiS]] to get alternatives to NatWest and
    if you tick the "Display only free fonts or free alternative fonts", it should
    give you "only free alternatives". But be careful with this online identification
    tool as it (sometimes) suggest illegal copies. My advice would be to run it, collect
    the ones you like and drop their names here and wait for an answer on their legitimacy.

    client who's previous rebrand has clearly used the Natwest font in their logo!!
    And part of me 'refreshing' the brand was NOT to change the logo. However I am
    now going to have to approach them and say 'Hey, not sure if you were aware but
    your logo is basically illegal' \u2013 hence why I would like to have a few suggestions
    to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nI'm liking the look of Bree by TypeTogether, comes
    in a semi serif version also which adds some nice variety =]"

  body: Wow... That's a real issue this one... The dirty part of your job looks like
    to also clean up the mess... For the rest, I really think Type Together's are
    definitely an option that could work in this case. Actually, I'm clearly not a
    great fan of this NatWest and I'm pretty convinced you should achieve some better
    job with Bree (or Etica). But I know Client is King. Good luck!

  body: "Yeah I think I have opened up a bag of worms (or whatever the saying is!).
    But hopefully they will appreciate my thorough approach as opposed to thinking
    I am a jobs-worth!\r\n\r\nMy plan was to not use Natwest Text as part of the refresh
    anyway, I was going to leave that as the logotype and find something with more
    weights and flexibility for the corporate typeface. As part of my research however
    I wanted to find out what was used in the logo and thats what has brought this
    all up!\r\n\r\nAnyway I am now in contact from someone at Dalton Maag aswell as
    the RBS group so I will get to the bottom of it :)"
