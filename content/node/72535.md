body: "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nThe FL5 PDF manual states: \"FontLab Studio 5 ships with a
  very extensive set of pre-installed default glyph template images\" and that they
  \"cover the entire Unicode 3.2 character set\" but I'm unable to find them on my
  system on which FL5 is loaded.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like exactly what I need to get
  started creating a Unicode font from multiple Latin and Greek fonts that we maintain
  for a client (created in Fontographer 4, used currently as Type1 fonts).\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas where I can get such a thing?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nKen"

    the default character images you can see in the background in each glyph cell.
    It gives you some idea what sort of glyph goes in each cell.\r\n\r\nHere's how
    it looks in the Glyph window (with the background image layer visible):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bg_6044.png]"

  body: "Yes, that was my assumption as well.\r\n\r\nThe part that had me excited
    was the \"cover the entire Unicode 3.2 character set\" statement. When I do a
    File, New in FontLab I get just the \"Default Encoding\" of 255 \"standard\" characters.
    The info in the FontLab manual sounds like there is a vfb file out there that
    has ALL the Unicode glyphs which would, theoretically, give me a place to being
    \"plugging in\" all the glyphs from our fonts, rather than starting from scratch."

    for more glyphs than just the 255, which I'm unable to get.\r\n\r\nI've tried
    changing the options in the font info and added code pages and selected Unicode
    ranges but I still only get the 255.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's just by inexperiance
    with FL5, there must be something I'm missing. I'll be back to it later today,
    hopefully dawn will break over this Marblehead.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKen"

  body: I think what you need is some sort of custom encoding. A good one to start
    with that has most of the character coverage you're looking for is the "FreeFont"
    encoding that comes with FontLab. Switch to the "Names" mode, then select FontLab
    > FreeFont from the encodings popup. Once you've filled in the characters you
    need, you can create your own encoding based on that if you want.

  body: "Ken, \r\n\r\nif you install the demo version of *Fontographer 5*, then in
    your FontLab Studio encodings list, a set of seven new OpenType encodings will
    appear in Names mode. (The encodings are shared between the products and can be
    used in any of them). \r\n\r\nThe new FontLab OpenType encoding files cover: \r\n*
    OpenType Standard\r\n* OpenType Latin Pro\r\n* OpenType Latin Pro + small caps,
    oldstyle figures and other glyphs\r\n* OpenType Latin, Cyrillic & Greek Pro\r\n*
    OpenType Latin, Cyrillic & Greek Pro + small caps, oldstyle figures and other
    glyphs\r\n* OpenType Latin, Cyrillic & Greek WGL4\r\n* OpenType Latin & Cyrillic
    Asian\r\n\r\nThose encodings will also be integrated directly into FontLab Studio
    6 which is under development. \r\n\r\nThese encodings are very up-to-date (much
    more recent than FreeFont Pro), and you can use them as basis for developing/extending
    your own encodings. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "The project is going to be a little more involved than you expect, but is
    certainly worth doing. I've done a fair bit of this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nHow
    I would work is to open your existing Type 1 fonts in FontLab, and first change
    all the character names to the correct names. For example, your \"alpha\" character
    is not currently named \"alpha\", because that won't work in Type 1 (unless you
    were working in something like TeX and wrote custom encoding vectors). Same for
    the ligatures, etc. etc. Happily, FL will change the names in your metrics file
    (.afm) automatically. If you don't want to lose all your kerning data, you'll
    need this as well.\r\n\r\nNow start a new file in FL, and cut & paste the characters,
    bringing up all the appropriate \"ranges\" as Adam suggested. Once all the characters
    are in, generate the Unicode numbers -- FL has a pulldown menu that will do this.
    Then write off an AFM file of this new font. Next, in a text editor, open up the
    old Type 1 AFMs (the intermediate ones where the characters have the correct name),
    and move all the KPX data to your new AFM. Be aware that if any of the character
    names differ, you'll lose that kern pair when read into FL, and there will be
    no warning of that.\r\n\r\nNow read the new (\"combined\") AFM file with all the
    KPX data into your new \"combined\" .vfb. You still have some OT features to write,
    but when that is done, you can use the \"generate kern data\" in the OT panel
    to move your kerns into GPOS type of kerning.\r\n\r\nDepending on how many glyphs
    you have, this would take me 2-3 days for a roman and italic. I do everything
    by hand except renaming the characters in the old Type 1 files. (I use an old
    TeX program, AFAIK, no longer available. No doubt there are others.) You could
    probably program more of the needed work, but then you have to learn how to write
    and use the programs, which takes time too. It is probably easier to do it by
    hand for one set of fonts, or contract out the work.\r\n\r\nDo a couple smaller
    test files to learn how thing work.\r\n\r\nOnce done, you will love it."
