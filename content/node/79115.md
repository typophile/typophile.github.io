body: "In the beginning was the Word. Then Chuck added other letters, numbers and
  signs.\r\n\r\nSome letters are so afraid of Chuck Norris that they form ligatures.\r\n\r\nFontLab
  never crashes for Chuck Norris.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris can tell whether the font is
  Arial or Helvetica \u2013 blindfolded.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris can literally draw a
  space glyph.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris knows where the circle begins.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris
  doesn\u2019t have to make spacing and kerning, glyphs do that themselves.\r\n\r\nChuck
  Norris can use zoom tool in FontLab up to the point where you can see specific atoms.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
  better not to see typefaces as good or bad; there is just a list of permitted fonts
  allowed to be (ab)used. List made by you know who.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris doesn\u2019t
  like children. That\u2019s why Comic Sans is on that list.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris once
  started designing a typeface when he was drunk. That night the \u201Cw\u201D was
  born.\r\n\r\n<em>Feel free to add other facts or image material.</em>"
