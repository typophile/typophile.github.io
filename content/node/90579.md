  body: "I'm very impressed! I have to ask, is this type common place in the typographers
    world? Are you that familiar with fonts? Or am I that unfamiliar with fonts? I
    guess what I'm saying is, how did you know that? \r\n"

  body: "I'm not your usual Typophilian who knows what it's all about.\r\n\r\nEach
    font is basically a unique design, so the goal here is to match what you have
    (a picture) to what I have (a font). I cheat and use software which compare the
    two. If I have a font, it will match. If I don't, it won't. No knowledge needed.
    Just load a picture, turn the crank and see what pops out. "
