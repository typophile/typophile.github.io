  not exactly a proper bitmap font just yet, but I wanted a bit of feedback before
  I pushed it any further. If anyone out there reads Thai, I&#39;d be eternally indebted
  for any comments as to its general legibilty. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s quite derivative

  body: 'Nathan, I&#39;m not a native but I read and speak a little Thai. <BR> <BR>So
    far, what you have is pretty neat, and I think it&#39;s great to see westerners
    working on Thai fonts.  I&#39;d like to do a few myself.  Here are a few comments:
    <BR> <BR>Serifs: Thai, of course, has those little circles &#40;I don&#39;t know
    the correct term&#41; that begin the stroke, and are important in distinguishing
    letters.  I think your typeface would benefit from indicating these with a more
    noticeable serif where they should be. <BR> <BR>The Bangkok Bank&#39;s logotype
    &#40;<a href="http://www.bbl.co.th/Bangkok%2BBank/Main.htm" target="_blank">http://www.bbl.co.th/Bangkok&#43;Bank/Main.htm</a>&#41;
    has a similar face, but theirs could use a small boost in legibility too, I think.
    <BR> <BR>? &amp; ? &#40;kho rakhang &amp; kho khuat&#41;: I think you&#39;re going
    to have to emphasize the upper-left part of these letters more.  Give them more
    room, and the less you use the half-width strokes, the better, in my opinion.
    <BR> <BR>? &amp; ? &#40;do dek &amp; to tao&#41;: I think the &#34;inner stems&#34;
    of these letters actually need to extend inside the letters&#39; counters more,
    and the left side should &#34;bubble out&#34; more if possible. <BR> <BR>Some
    of these suggestions may apply to other letters too.  Good work!  I&#39;d like
    to see more. <BR> <BR>Paul'

  body: Thanks for the suggestions, Paul. I&#39;ve been tweaking kho rakhang et al
    - trying to extend those strokes without creating enough space under them to graze
    herds of sheep. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a happy median somewhere. And, the more
    I look at it, I think you&#39;re right about the half-width strokes. They get
    pretty annoying. Once I get some revisions done this weekend, I&#39;ll throw up
    another image. BTW, I really like that no nu in Bangkok Bank. <BR> <BR>Part of
    the impetus for starting work on Thai fonts is due to a friend of mine from Bangkok
    who was lamenting the dearth of good Thai language fonts. Both &#34;modernist&#34;
    display varieties &#40;he&#39;s of the opinion that Thailand missed out on modernism
    almost entirely and went straight to glorious <a href="http://www.thomasriddle.net/high-on-chatuchak/pages/elephant800.htm"
    target="_blank"> post-modernity</a>&#41; - and also decent bilingual faces. That
    is, other than Angsana and Cordia and whatever other crap comes bundled in Windows.
    In fact, what he wants is something along the lines of what you posted Hrant.
    Something without all the &#34;curlicues.&#34; So I&#39;ve also been working on
    another face &#40;which I&#39;ll post sometime soon&#41; that&#39;s supposed to
    work with Univers.  <BR> <BR>And if you&#39;re interested Paul, there are some
    good online <a href="http://seasrc.th.net/paper/paper.htm" target="_blank"> papers</a>
    about Thai characters by a computational linguist working at CRCL Bangkok. <BR>

  body: Yeah, when I was in Thailand I saw quite a bit of &#34;Latinization&#34; -
    ranging anywhere from a scary Thai version of Westminster to some pretty nice
    modern typography. E.g., the Futura-looking labels on the phone booths in Chiang
    Mai. I wonder if that&#39;s mostly due to the monstrous sweep of the West into
    Asia, or if it might just be the evolution of their script. After all, English
    has come a long way from Lombardic script and blackletter.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally,
    somewhere in vast expanse of cyberspace, there&#39;s a 14MB .pdf file of a 400
    page book &#40;in Thai&#41; that, I believe, is a treatise of some sort on Thai
    letter design. The last 250 pages are a huge collection of specimens of available
    Thai faces. For the life of me, I can&#39;t find the link to it, but if anyone&#39;s
    interested, I could burn a CD of it and toss it in the mail. <BR> <BR>And I&#39;ll
    post another file soon of the revisions to this face. <BR> <BR>Cheers.

    both. <BR>But &#34;evolution&#34; can often have bad effects - it needs to be
    managed. A writing system is an extremely powerful piece of cultural identity,
    and a homogenous gray world seems deathly boring, no? <BR> <BR>On the other hand,
    it&#39;s a complex issue: there are certainly some good reasons to bring &#34;modernism&#34;
    to different parts of the world - it&#39;s enriching. But it does have to be done
    sensitively: in the sample I showed &#40;the bottom line&#41;, the results are
    both overly harmful to Thai culture <i>and</i> dysfunctional as well: when a person
    who reads both Thai and some Latinate language sees that thing, it&#39;s just
    confusing. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Wow, that PDF you describe sound like a dream...

    that may have been a <BR>good thing, since i couldn&#39;t trick myself into knowing
    <BR>what a shape  was without actually knowing. the only <BR>specific forms i
    remember were the two that i posted, <BR>one from the original, one from the revision.
    i can&#39;t <BR>remember which one was which. the shape on the  <BR>left in the
    images is more legible &#40;i think. remember, <BR>i don&#39;t know what it&#39;s
    &#34;supposed&#34; to look like&#41; because <BR>of the more pronounced indent
    of the leg. there were <BR>a few others that were similar, but i didn&#39;t have

  body: zoinks. i can barely tell the difference between ru, tho thung, ko kai, kho
    khai, and kho khuat, at least from the unicode link i was looking at. this bitmap
    idea of yours is more challenging than i thought. apparently how the glyphs are
    read depends not so much on the mark but on where the mark is placed inside &#40;or
    outside&#41; of a certain shape, or even the length of a stem, kind of like we
    can tell the difference between a lowercase l and a lowercase i without a dot.
    at least i think this is what&#39;s going on. so, the difference between ko kai
    and tho thung doesn&#39;t need to be exaggerated. the question is whether a thai
    speaker would recognize a crooked leg or a nick out of the leg more easily. on
    screen at small sizes, the crooked leg jumps out more, but will it be recognized?
    any way, i&#39;m starting to confuse myself.  <BR>  <BR>as for our conversation
    the other day, well, anyone reading bitmapped thai text on their pda most likely
    isn&#39;t concerned with the cultural authenticity of the thing. imagine everyone
    in deutschland reading books that look like they came straight off of gutenberg&#39;s
    press, or romans carrying books made of stone with words chiseled into them. i&#39;m
    not promoting global homogeneity, but everything has to evolve. the curlycues
    being replaced by dashes or whatever seems like the equivalent of serif vs. sans.
    we all know f is f. the evolution of thai faces may be more modernization than
    latinization. we aren&#39;t trapped in world of handwriting, neither should they
    be, so bravo on your efforts. i hope they like it chiang mai.

  body: 'Ah, quite true. Thanks for that link, hhp. Incidentally, the last character
    in the shortened version &#40;Krung Thep&#41; is called <i>pai yan noi</i>, and
    it&#39;s used for abbreviation or ellipsis. So in the case, it stands for the
    rest of the ridiculously long name ;-&#41; Sometimes though, you&#39;ll see &#34;Bangkok&#34;
    spelled with the first twelve letters &#40;or thirteen if you&#39;re counting
    the under vowel on the second consonant&#41;. '

  body: 'If you&#39;re interested James, The longer version &#40;12 character: see
    below&#41; of Bangkok is <i>Krung Thep Mahanakhon</i> or &#34;Metropolitan Bangkok&#34;.
    There&#39;s also a three letter version which is like &#34;LA&#34; or &#34;NYC&#34;
    &#40;also below&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The two versions of &#34;Thailand&#34; that I
    posted above translate to &#40;1&#41; <i>bpratheht Thai</i> and &#40;2&#41; <i>Thai</i>.
    <i>Bpratheht</i> essentially means &#34;country&#34; or &#34;nation,&#34; but
    in Thailand most of the signage uses the second version, as <i>bpratheht</i> is
    really a Western concept, not very Thai. <BR> <BR>Krung Thep Mahanakhon <BR><img

  body: '&#62;in Thailand most of the signage uses the second version <BR> <BR>Actually,
    that&#39;s wrong. Government signage does in fact use <i>bprathehtthai</i> - the
    &#34;official name.&#34; So for an identity project, that would be more appropriate.
    Sorry &#39;bout that.'

  body: SWFs do not post as easily as GIFs. More, if you translate &#42;.unk into
    &#42;.swf&#39;s, they are not replicated at original size, but at some browser-mazimizing
    size, destroying pixel lock. an associated HTML file helps, a GIF screen dump
    helps more. Not to say Flash compatibility is unimportant to prove - it&#39;s
    huge. Only, get Unicode compatible ASAP. <BR>The unk/swf showed me a clear Thai
    on the grid, making me think of futurist Thai space travel, starring stars I have
    never seen.&#42;&#42;I only know Thai from my local restaurants &#40;in San Francisco,
    that is a reasonable taste&#41;. <BR>Nathan, if you&#39;d like to publish this
    font or a greyscale adaptation, please let me know. My eye cannot tell if it&#39;s
    been Latinized but I assume the damage is minimal.
