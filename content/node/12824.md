body: "Hi, I'm hoping someone can advise me on this one small question. \r\n\r\nIn
  our books, we usually list the typeface(s), and sometimes the designer, such as:\r\n\r\nType
  set in <em>Typeface</em>\r\nor\r\nTypeface: <em>Typeface</em> by <em>Designer</em>\r\nor\r\nTypeface:
  <em>Foundry  Typeface</em>\r\n\r\nThis info typically goes in the colophon, or sometimes
  on the copyright page. Recently, I found this little tidbit in one foundry's EULA:\r\n\r\n<em>The
  names of these typefaces are registered trademarks of [Foundry], and as such may
  only be used in keeping with accepted trademark practice, including identification
  of the trademark owner's name and only in conjunction with output produced using
  this font software. </em>\r\n\r\nWhat is \"accepted trademark practice\"?<!--break-->
  (I looked through the Typowiki and didn't find anything.) It seems extreme to do
  something like:\r\n\r\nTypeface: <em>Typeface</em>TM by <em>Designer</em>\r\n<em>Typeface</em>
  is a registered trademark of <em>Foundry</em>\r\n\r\nHow would you handle this?
  Any advice?"

    for that. -- Each foundry probably has what they consider to the <em>the</em>
    way to identify their typefaces. Does the foundry have any samples? I just googled
    this, as I'll bet you did first anyway, and it seems several foundries use the
    same phrase. I'd probably lean toward the second option. I am sure that the foundry
    will simply appreciate the effort made. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    means... or just go with the flow?\r\n\r\nHere are some credits in books I pulled
    off my shelf:\r\n\r\n- \"Set in 12-point Minion by the Perseus Books Group\"\r\n\r\n-
    \"Text set in Electra\"\r\n\r\n- \"The text of this book is composed in Bauer
    Bodoni and Helvetica Condensed Light with display in Helvetica Condensed Bold.\"\r\n\r\n-
    \"The text face is <em>Alisal</em>, designed by Matthew Carter from Carter & Cone.
    The headlines and labeling are set in various weights of <em>Faceplate</em>, designed
    by Rodrigo Xavier Cavazos from Psy/Ops.\"\r\n\r\n- \"Typest [sic] in 10/12pt Palatino
    by Intype, London\"\r\n\r\n- \"Composed in Scala and Scala Sans, typefaces designed
    my Martin Majoor in 1994.\"\r\n\r\nBased on these samples I gather that no publisher
    is putting a little TM or (R) after names of typefaces. The last one is from the
    <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> and I tend to defer to them.   (Although... <a
    href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/press_release.html\">the FontFont site</a> does
    use the (R) registered trademark symbol after Scala, I can't read their EULA without
    buying anything, so I don't know whether or not it includes any language like
    the quote in my original post.)"

    mentions trademarks these days (i.e., Coca-Cola, MS-Windows, etc.), and 99% of
    the time, these are not properly attributed. Ideally, when the text is edited,
    the copy-editor who flag-down and research every mentioned trademark. Then the
    very last page of the book could have all of the trademarks listed together in
    full legalese is six-point condensed light type, or something ridiculous. At least
    then they are in there, and you have yourself covered, should anything come up
    (which it wouldn't).\r\n\r\nIt is mis-uses of big-company trademarks that I would
    worry about more (i.e., the Coca-Colas and the Microsofts, etc.). Typefaces are
    trademarked so that others do not make fonts that us the same name (or something

    names, including products from big companies like Xerox, Kodak, Adobe. We did
    double-check all the names to make sure they were all spelled, capitalized, and

  body: "I would have to agree with marcox: as far as I know, colophons are a courtesy,
    not a legal requirement. What I believe the EULA referenced does <em>not</em>
    say is that you are obliged to acknowledge every instance of the typeface's use.
    What it <em>does</em> say is, if you <em>choose</em> to credit use of this typeface,
    please spell our name correctly and completely (including any trademark designations
    affixed thereunto), and make sure you actually used the typeface you said you
    used.\r\n\r\n<strong>hrant: <em>Anybody who ever thinks that has to be completely
    bonkers.</em></strong>\r\n\r\nSigh...H-man, when are you gonna learn: punctuating
    your arguments with insults doesn't make them more persuasive arguments; if anything,
    it makes them <em>less</em> persuasive, because you seem compelled to add a spurious
    <em>ad hominem</em> element to them.\r\n\r\nAnd it might also be productive for
    you to stop for a moment to consider the possible consequences of your continuing
    campaign against EULAs. As things currently stand, although a EULA is a legally
    binding contract, virtually all foundries treat them as gentlemen's agreements.
    The rest of the world is not so understanding. Assume for a moment that you wanted
    to purchase an automobile on time, as most folks do. You go to the dealership,
    select an auto to your liking, and are handed a purchase contract. If, at this
    point, you were to say, \"I do not accept this contract because it exploits the
    working man,\" do you think for an instant that you would drive out of that lot
    in that car? Even if you were to keep silent and sign the contract, with the intent
    of ignoring it once you got what you wanted, it wouldn't take long for the repo
    man to show up and reclaim the car.\r\n\r\nThankfully, font foundries do not employ
    such measures against people who fail to live up to their end of the contract...but
    what if they <em>did</em>?  Consider for a moment this scenario which, unless
    I have a gift for clairvoyance of which I was hitherto unaware, is purely hypothetical:\r\n\r\nA
    major distributor of fonts who is also a major player in professional imaging
    decides that your attitude toward EULAs is actually the one which prevails in
    the marketplace. In response to this scofflaw attitude, a new font format (for
    argument's sake, let's call it OpenType 2) and a new imaging protocol (let's call
    it Postscript 4) are developed which <strong>require</strong> the purchaser to
    register a font online before it can be installed, much like the registration
    systems now employed by other software manufacturers. In order to install the
    font, you must accept the EULA; if you attempt to install the font on more machines
    than the number for shich you have purchased a license, you will be unable to.
    To round out the picture, let's say that our hypothetical Postscript 4 will only
    accept this new font format and will only allow you to image the fonts which have
    been registered in this manner. And every time you upgrade computers, you will
    have to go through a process of unregistering and verifying delection all of the
    fonts on your old computer, and installing and reregistering them on your new
    box.\r\n\r\nProbable? Likely? Even possible? It doesn't matter. If the major players
    became convinced that their economic interests are being threatened, they <em>will</em>
    take  measures to protect themselves. Well, think again. Let's keep the agreements
    gentlemanly...and while, we're at it, let's keep the debate here gentlemanly,
    as well."
