  created the label is unfortunately permanently unavailable.\r\nIf anyone could identify
  the font used for \"LOCALLY ROASTED GIBSONS, BC | ONE FULL POUND\" \"DRAGONFLY\"
  \"MED DARK\" it would be greatly appreciated! I believe the font is the same throughout!\r\n\r\nThank
  You!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bk_4337.png]\r\n"
