  right. Not much of a forum user normally. \r\n\r\nAnyway, can anyone help me with
  this? I was looking for something very similar to this last week, and came across
  this the other day on a recipe card at Starbucks. I scanned it in and searched WhatTheFont,
  the closest thing it came up with was Wingate JL, but with my limited knowledge
  of type, the only thing that i notice to be different immediately was the leg of
  the R. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n"

    him hence, not programed well- like most free fonts that have poor kerning.\r\n\r\nI
    love the R too. I have a feeling its a customized by the in-house Starbucks art
    group. But what the original typeface I do not know.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Thank you both for your help. In case you were curious, I think I found it.
    I realized that I had recognized this font from a piece that came across my desk
    the other day. It was a proof that I received from another designer asking what
    I thought. I was able to open it up in Illustrator and find out the fonts I didn't
    have on my system. If I'm right, it looks to be a combination of Chalet Comprime
    1960 and Chalet Comprime 1970 from House Industries. Thank god for the Lettersetter
    and other designers not outlining their fonts. Now I can rest. Thanks again for
    your help.\r\n\r\nSeth\r\n\r\n"
