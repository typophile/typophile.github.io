  body: "Celeste:\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to identify this sixteenth century font,
    it is such a difficult task, because so many punchcutters of the age are anonymous
    and all of them were trying to emulate the very same forms.\r\n\r\nAnd I can tell:
    after a nine-year research, I still don\u2019t know by sure if the types printed
    by Antonio de Espinosa were designed by him. But my revival will be named Espinosa,
    anyway, since he is the most probable author (more about this in Atypi 2009, if
    my proposal is accepted).\r\n\r\nBut if you want to know if something like this
    is digitized, I\u2019d say Garamond Premier Pro is the closer you can get. And
    yes, in some details, Adobe Caslon Pro is even closer (A, N).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garamond_Caslon_4037.png]"

  body: "Thanks!! It really looks like an ansemble of Garamond and Caslon... but it
    could not be a Caslon because of it's age... I'll start my search in XVI c. french
    typography first.\r\nThe Q makes me think of Granjon, but the other letters don't..."
