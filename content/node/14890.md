body: "We here at MegaCorporation use outside vendors for some of our printed materials.
  For particular campaigns that last over a period of weeks or months, we create a
  style sheet that indicates standards of usage for logos, graphics, color palettes,
  typefaces, etc. Our vendors are able to access the style sheet as well as all graphics
  through an FTP site. For the typefaces, we use the following language:\r\n\r\n<strong>To
  maintain the integrity of the design for the brand/season, only the following approved
  fonts are to be used. It is the vendor\u2019s legal responsibility to license these
  fonts.</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the listing of typefaces, we provide the following information:
  \r\n\r\n<strong>Available for purchase from www.[foundryname].com</strong>\r\n\r\nI
  am now confronting a new issue. We are contemplating altering a font slightly for
  a future campaign. We plan to get permission to alter the font from the foundry
  and designer. \r\n\r\nWhat concerns me is the legal responsibilities the corporation
  has to the original foundry and designer if this new custom font is distributed
  to vendors. I believe the vendors should be required to purchase a license to the
  existing font (from which our font is derived) before receiving a copy of our modified
  font.\r\n\r\nAs font designers, what would you expect a responsible corporation
  do in such a circumstance? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Should we strongly urge our vendors to
  purchase the license and provide the font to them? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Should our corporation
  ask the vendor for physical proof of proper licensing before distributing the custom
  font?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Should the corporation contact the foundry to make sure a particular
  vendor has the proper licensing before distributing the font. (I can just imagine
  how happy our project coordinators would be to have such a delay built in to the
  process.)\r\n\r\nThis presumes that the corporation has gotten permission from the
  original foundry and/or designer to alter the original font. I will, of course,
  follow the licensing requirements from the particular foundry we contact on this
  particular campaign. What I'm asking for is what you would consider \"best practice\"
  for a corporation when this issue arises. Trying to be proactive here....\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristin"

  body: "My advice would be to work closely and directly with the font vendor on this
    process. Obviously just posting the modified fonts to your suppliers prior to
    them obtaining rights to accept them makes your actions illegal. \r\n\r\nI'd contact
    the font vendor and say that you're planning to use a modified version of their
    font X in your templates and that 'n' named suppliers need to be invoiced. You
    might be able to negotiate a discount if 'n' is a large enough number. \r\n\r\nThen
    let your suppliers know that you've provided their contact details to the font
    vendor who will invoice them directly and require payment within 30 days.\r\n\r\nIf
    the font vendor doesn\u2019t hear from all the suppliers then they\u2019ll know
    who at the corporation to contact. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"

    hold a copy of CorpFontY and license that version? It seems to me that FoundryX
    might even prefer that if dealing with your Corp. \r\n\r\nInteresting ..."

  body: Kristin (hi!), please do let us know what happens. This is a very useful question
    and the answer will be equally useful. I think.
