  edition) once again and especially Chapter 8: \"Shaping the Page.\" My publication
  is a multi-column periodical; page size is standard 8.5x11\" or close to it. I'm
  trying to use his chromatic scale (page 146) to determine the proportions of the
  text block. Most of the graphic design forums I appeal to for help just give me
  a blank look, so I turn to typographers. \r\n\r\nMy question: If you have a given
  page size (let's say 8.5x11,\" which corresponds to the tall half-octagon or a fourth
  on the chromatic scale), how do you determine the text block? Just mix and match
  it with the other proportions (major 6th, diminished 5th, major 3rd, etc.)? "

  body: Bringhurst and Hochuli/Kinross were my Bibles as I learned the craft of book
    design. Rich Hendel's book, too. As I got more experienced, I began to see that
    there was an art to it as well. All of which is to say I came to mix and match
    things that looked attractive to my eye, taking into account what types the material
    called for and at what size and leading. You have to trust your instincts applied
    to what you've learned, without doing "cute" design that distracts the reader.

    a grid calculator which is available online at http://layoutgridcalculator.com\r\nplease
    have a look at the 'golden canon' page, this will set a grid according to Tsichichold
    golden canon."

  body: "Steve, I agree: Richard Hendel\u2019s books (\u201COn Book Design\u201D and
    \u201CAspects of Contemporary Book Design\u201D) are great reads in addition the
    Bringhurst\u2019s bible. I also enjoyed Jan Tschichold\u2019s essays.\r\n\r\nNick,
    I\u2019m by far no expert in book design but I enjoy it very much. What helped
    me most was trial-and-error, which is probably what Steve is also saying. Jump
    into a design, print it, and look at it. Tweak it a dozen times, print them, spread
    them all side-by-side, and feel out which works best for you. I found that it\u2019s
    not just the dimensions of the page and text block, but the interplay of typeface,
    letter- and line spacing (defining the \u201Ccolor\u201D of the text block), text
    block dimensions and placement wrt. page dimensions, and so forth.\r\n\r\nMost
    of all\u2026 have fun :)"
