  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm designing a biz card and just had a question concerning the address block. The client has a PO Box and my question is; Is it correct to set 'PO' in small caps <em>and</em> set the word 'box' with a capital 'B' or should I set the entire word in small caps. Also, when setting an e-mail address on a biz card, is it necessary to type 'e-mail' in front of it? Is it something that is obvious or will it be confused with a web address? I personally would like to do without the 'e-mail' title for simplicity's sake. 

Welcome any and all input you may have. Thanks in advance.

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">my feeling: no rules, whatever looks good in context, less is preferable.

the po box question depends on context, styles, weights, overall block layout, 
any other uses of smallcaps ? does it stand out ? how many pieces of contact info need to appear, etc.

i try to keep some sort of rhythm to the whole thing, with consistent weights,
prefixes, labels (or not) so it all holds together. 

i prefer to leave off the word "e-mail" as it's usually self explanatory, 
as are phone numbers, but on occaision you have a list of several contact options:

office:  
cell:  
fax: 
e-mail:   

in which case consistency suggests giving them all the same status, but you've got to balance simpicity with clarity. if one piece of info stands out as odd from the rest, there's probably a better way.</div>

As to business cards, simplicity is best. The less text you have, the easier it is to find what you are looking for without wading through it. People look at business cards specifically to find your email address, so they probably can identify it at first sight without a label.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone. This is just the right input I needed.

<em>the po box question depends on context, styles, weights, overall block layout, any other uses of smallcaps?</em>

The reason I'm using small caps is because I'm using oldstyle numerals for the PO Box numbers, zip codes and telephone numbers to help with readabilty (the type is set in Freight Sans 8pt and it's a tightly spaced font).

<em>Use small caps if the letters are meant to be read as letters, not as words. So in this case, small caps PO, u&lc Box works.</em>

I Agree. I'll go with my original plan.

This is how the address reads (PO and PA will be set in small caps and all numbers will be oldstyle figures, I even chose that PO Box specificaly becuase the '6' ascends, the '9' descends and the '8' ascends making it easier to read at small sizes).

po Box 1698
Reading, pa 19603

<em>People look at business cards specifically to find your email address, so they probably can identify it at first sight without a label.</em>

Yeah you're right.

Thanks everyone, appreciate it.

Ha! not that I'm aware of. I thought of that, but I just felt it didn't work as well. I like the mixed settings (I think it shows attention to detail).

		<div class="commentbody">Nothing <em>per vim</em> is wrong as long as the address on the business card can be used. My interpretation is based on the fact that an address will be made up of a selection of numerals and words and each word will be in title case. So to introduce another level, especially at the beginning of a line, might affect the harmony of the setting, more significantly it might also affect the usability of the card, while not gaining anything.
