  Script</a></strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/almo_3846.jpg]\r\n\r\nTall
  ascenders and long descenders, wind-bent just the right way. Weathered capitals
  feature artistry to touch off waves of mystique and experience. Almond Script is
  rusty and textured calligraphy as only Angel Koziupa and Alejandro Paul can make
  it. Scarred and wavy like an exhausted warrior, slim and delicate like a tango dancer,
  this typeface is a unique convergence of the rough ancient brush and the modern
  Latin elegance.\r\n\r\nNine out of ten packaging design experts agree: Almond Script
  has nothing to do with whitening your teeth, but it certainly can brand your product
  like no other script can. A feature-rich OpenType version is also available.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong><a
  href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000214\">Cafelatte</a></strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cafe_5837.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
  not everyday that you would want to have dark chocolate with your favorite latt\xE9.
  But sometimes, as out of the ordinary as it is, it can be just the ticket. Cafelatte\u2019s
  design offers a somewhat unpolished calligraphic concept, reminiscent of wooden
  type, but finessed with the unique brush of Angel Koziupa and the Bezier wizardry
  of Alejandro Paul. The discerning packaging designer will certainly find it refreshing
  to be able to put a darker, unconventional touch on his or her design. And who says
  primal instincts can\u2019t be expressed elegantly? A feature-rich OpenType version
  is also available.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000248\">Aguafina
  Script</a></strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/agua_3497.jpg]\r\n\r\nSemi-formal
  and eye-catching elegance is the name of the game, says Aguafina Script, Koziupa
  and Paul\u2019s latest creation. Graceful, but not too casual. Knowledgeable and
  artistic, but not too imposing. The characters flow into each other, making a very
  saucy script with appetizing color. The narrow lowercase allows for efficient use
  of space, while the long ascenders and descenders help maintain the legibility.
  A very unique find among scripts, Aguafina is useful for product packaging, glossy
  magazine work, and book covers. A feature-rich OpenType version is also available.\r\n"
