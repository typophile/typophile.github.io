body: "If your sample is available online, you can link to it via a hyperlink, though
  we prefer you upload an attachment in the thread itself. There are two options:\r\n\r\nTo
  attach an image in your original post.\r\n<ol><li>Click <strong>edit</strong> in
  the black bar at the top (right under the thread title) if you're adding an image
  to a pre-existing thread.</li>\r\n<li>At the bottom of the page you'll see <strong>Attachments</strong>
  in red.</li>\r\n<li>Click <strong>Browse</strong> and select the image on your hard
  drive.</li>\r\n<li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li></ol>\r\n\r\nTo use the inline
  image upload feature you will need a current version of the  <a href=\"http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\">Flash
  Player</a>. Once you have it installed you will see an \u201CInsert image\u201D
  link on the post form. After clicking that link, browse your hard drive and select
  the desired image.\r\n\r\nMake sure your sample image is compatible with this board:\r\n<ul><li><strong>RGB</strong>
  only, no CMYK</li>\r\n<li><strong>GIF</strong>, <strong>PNG</strong> or <strong>JPEG</strong>
  only, no TIFF or BMAP</li>\r\n<li>although <strong>PDF</strong>s are supported,
  we <em>really</em> don't like them (unless it's a vector file)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nIf
  you do not comply to these specifications, there's a high probability your sample
  won't show up in certain browser versions.\r\n\r\nMind the size \u2013 don't post
  unnecessary big images and do not exceed <strong>590 pixels</strong> in width.\r\n\r\n"

    date on Typophile via the Tracker: http://www.typophile.com/tracker and what I
    thought would be nice is if all Type-IDs had an ''ID:'' before them. ie. ''ID:
    Something similar to House Gothic'' This would help myself and others who use
    the Tracker to understand which threads are IDs and which pertain to the forums.
    I understand this might end up being too much work for you and Stephen because
    not everyone would adhere to this policy. Just and idea really...to make some
    of our lives easier and some of our lives harder :-P'

    or CMYK actually doesn\u2019t affect the upload: It\u2019s just that CMYK images
    don\u2019t show up in a number of browers, and therefore are of little use.\r\n\r\n<cite>reinstall

  body: "Hi Florian,\r\n\r\n\"Reinstall my system\" is a joke. I am not going to do
    that :). Listen, I have got the right image format. I said that the name of the
    file has \"cmyk\" on it and that doesn't change a thing. Even if the file was/is
    a four channels of color, or a single index color channel, that wouldn't make
    any difference.\r\n\r\nI don't remember when I did install the new Flash but it
    wasn't long long ago, maybe a month ago or so. Just to satisfy your curiosity:
    I have uploaded a bunch of images and it is just click and insert the image, even
    Simone, my kitty, could do that.\r\n\r\nIn the other hand it is interesting that
    sometimes I am able to upload without problems and, sometimes I don't. When I
    have the error message, sometimes by simple restarting safari it let me do it
    ...\r\n\r\nThe naming: Remember when files couldn't have a file name bigger then
    8 characters, and the habitual \"don't use ! \" # $ % & / ( ) = strange characters,
    specially asterisk\"?\r\n\r\nI guess you are right: It is Flash doing it. I can't
    tell because when I hear Flash, the first thing that comes to my mind is, Gordon.\r\n\r\nIt
    is not a big deal. I am just saying: Sometimes it does not, work."
