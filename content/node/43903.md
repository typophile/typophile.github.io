body: "Fathom five (or 5 - or something) was as site I use to be quite fond of years
  ago. Essentially it was a forum where designers posted favourite or just plain interesting
  websites, critiqued and compared them and talked about web design in general.  Zeldman
  and a few other well known web designers were regulars. The site just disappeared
  one day. I logged on and it seemed someone had hacked in and snagged the URL and
  put up their own stuff there. It went from beautiful to ugly and malicious - Unlike
  the April 1 version of Typophile, it wasn't a joke. Fathom five came back for a
  little while, but I think it kind of fizzled out soon after. \r\n\r\nMy first reaction
  on logging in here April one was that the site had been hijacked. \r\n"
