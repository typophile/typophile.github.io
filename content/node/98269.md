  company's music tape products. Sample is all the same font but the first word is
  very high quality and the second word is a bit rough.\r\n\r\nI note some telltale
  signs, IE, the \"O\" is somewhat squashed and squared off, and the \"S\" and \"R\"
  are fairly distinctive.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ampex-STEREOfont_6055.jpg]"
