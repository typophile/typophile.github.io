  by, among other things, a recent Typophile thread about e-books, I've decided to
  show exactly what I have against them, by demonstrating all the tools that are available
  to a designer of printed, but not electronic, books.\r\n\r\n<em>The Perks of Print</em>
  is a sardonic celebration of the printed word. In this poster series, I subject
  e-readers and other electronics to the same processes that produce beautiful printed
  books, and thereby destroy them in the process.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maps-typophile_6285.png]\r\n\r\nSee
  more at www.perksofprint.com.\r\n\r\nAs I will shortly be starting a production
  run of these prints, as well as a Kickstarter project to fund the creation of more
  of them, I'd like to hear some responses. Would you want a print? What would you
  pay for one? Do you have any perks of your own to suggest?"

    celebration, not sardonic. I find it absolutely bizarre that you would use something
    that looks like Photoshop to lament the ways technology has supplanted ink on
    paper. So you really dig all of the digital tools you now have at your disposal,
    but resent that production has gone electronic as well as design. I think the
    title of your poster series should be Hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nFrank U."

  body: Mixed feelings about these. They are creative and obviously took a lot of
    work, but to me they don't pack the impact that I think you're trying for. Die
    cutting is used in only a tiny percentage of printed pieces, and I don't have
    any nostalgia for tea-stained maps, so while the layouts are creative they don't
    resonate with me. Sorry.

    and over on the left. The drama of die cut see through seems is 'stalled' or compromised
    and somewhat muddy. Was the die cut propped up and then shot?\r\n\r\nPerk #2,
    shouldn't the tea cup and saucer and table be digitally rotated about 1 degree
    or so ccw?  The composition wobbles. When the image is stabilized then the steam
    will become more dynamic. \r\n\r\nJust sayin'.\r\n\r\nDefinitely A+ for effort!!

  body: "Quite interesting idea, but the finish...\r\n\r\nI really like the effort
    and tricks put into it, but your typography looks placed randomly. It's large,
    blunt, there is no tension between the picture and the type which makes it interesting.\r\n\r\nI
    don't want to be too negative, but your ideas could be worked out amazingly with
    a better finish. The Kindle composition is floating (even without the drop shadow!),
    sags downwards. The tea one looks like a tea commercial instead of a stand for
    the merits of print.\r\n\r\nAlso, you overshoot your point, you make digitally
    what you dislike, isn't that a contradiction? I think these ideas could be so
    much better in real cliches, gravures or even better, cyanotype or other vintage
    photography mediums (no crappy, overdone instagram filters, but go back 100 years!).
    The pictures are just too 'finished' which makes it hard for the type to compete
    with it.\r\n\r\nI do want to see your other ideas and results though! Good Luck!"

    too concerned about wastefulness here. \r\n\r\nPrint has one obvious perk: physical
    books have value on the second-hand market; today's DRM technology doesn't offer
    the equivalent.\r\n\r\nAnd e-books have the advantage that you can fit a library
    in a pocket.\r\n\r\nPeople can make their own choices based on their rational
    self-interest; I'm not fond of the emotional manipulation techniques used in advertising
    <em>wherever</em> they are used, but their use in opposition to previous use by
    conventional commercial interests at least has the virtue of provoking thought
    and comment.\r\n\r\nSo my response is guarded but positive."

    is a practical lowest bottom to the techniques used. I, for one, applaud the idea

    itself: maybe you could try this. Make \"The perks of print\" a lot smaller, and
    set the 'poster title' in italics?"

    accept my apology JL. The work seemed just like so much that I've seen where Photoshop
    is used to electronically mimic printing textures and techniques, and I didn't
    check the link you provided. However, I still find it ironic even knowing your
    process was physical rather than digital. But to each his or her own. I imagine
    that one day when teleportation becomes a reality, people will reminisce about
    how much nicer it was to wait in airports and ride airplanes. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nFinkelstein"

  body: "All right, let me address some of the comments.\r\n\r\nFirstly, yes, this
    is a project with a high degree of irony, and that's completely intentional. It
    is also a project with a sense of humor, and I hope that comes across, though
    it may be clearer in some of the zanier posters I have planned.\r\n\r\n5star \u2014
    thanks for your critique. You're right about the second image needing rotation,
    and you're not the first to provide feedback about the lack of clarity in the
    first.\r\n\r\nThe question of finish, as touched on by Arthus, is one that I've
    been debating from the start, and I'm not sure if I've made the right decision.
    This question has a lot to do with whether I see myself as making fine art prints
    or more commercial posters, and who the potential audience is \u2014 something
    I'm still working through. Certainly, the fact that the posters have a blatant
    point of view and a corresponding caption really put them more in the realm of
    pop art or even propaganda, which I don't necessarily mind, though I hope the
    absurdity of the whole endeavor softens the bluntness a little. I've thought about
    shooting some more lyrical photos just focused on the qualities of the electronic
    devices as objects, preferably on film. This is probably worth pursuing, and would
    lead to a series of images with a similar theme but very different tone.\r\n\r\nMore
    thoughts are always welcome."

    name: JamesM
  body: "> who the potential audience is \r\n\r\nYeah, that's something I was going
    to mention and forgot. The die cutting one seems to be aimed more at graphic professionals
    (I suspect that many people in the general public don't even know what the term
    means), but the tea-stained one seems aimed at a different audience."

  body: "As for the point above by James: The audience varies for your first two posters,
    but I'm sure that the gaps will be filled while you continue the project, so that's
    not a big issue I think.\r\n\r\nI think an issue is still the quality difference.
    Your pictures are really crisp, shiny, studio shots. You need to come with something
    to offset this since the type falls flat. \r\n\r\nGo for the overkill (a waste
    of the good pictures), or underplay it. I think having a recurring layout theme
    instead of creating different ones for each poster will help. In the end, I suspect
    most people will buy the poster for the image and concept anyway. Perhaps have
    a small white tag in one of the corners with the title and 'perk', maybe even
    something logotype-ish.\r\n\r\nThis will tie all posters together in the end,
    and at the same time make it a bit of a campaign for the merits of print, which
    is also what you want to achieve.\r\n\r\nMy previous comment about the techniques
    is probably still valid, but I think your current approach will be the better
    solution the more posters you make, since then the classic techniques don't become
    quirky any more but boring due to repetition."
