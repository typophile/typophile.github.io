  body: "Are you certain the book was published by Black Sun? It is not listed in
    their body of works. Mr. Crosby did own a copy of the first English translation
    of Krafft-Ebing's \"Psychopathia Sexualis\", Rebman, London 1905, but I see no
    evidence he ever reprinted it. Frankly its content does not fit within the scope
    of what they normally published.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, you still want to
    know the font. Knowing where it was published and by whom might make identification
    a bit easier."

  body: "OK, here's what I can find....\r\n\r\nThe font in the picture has not been
    identified. It does, however, have many quirky characters which the old metal
    face Grasset (Deberny & Peignot, 1898; ATF, 1904; and Monotype, 1912) has in common.
    The overall look is very similar.\r\n\r\nI suspect the font in the picture is
    based on Grasset -- or the other way around. Grasset is not available in digital
    form under that name that I could find, but there are two digital versions under
    other names.\r\n\r\nOctavian, at http://www.myfonts.com/search/octavian/fonts/
    (not a very good version -- look at the lowercase /t -- it is way over-size)\r\n\r\nGrantham,
    free download at http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/grantham.htm.
    This appears to be a pretty good version and should at least give you the appearance
    you are looking for.\r\n\r\nUnless, of course, you are wishing to digitize the
    font in the picture. If that is the case, you still have to identify it and find
    a usable specimen of it.\r\n"

    by Jaspert: \"...designed by M.F. Benton, based on a Bodoni model, but with the
    peculiarity found in a number of modernistic types of making the thicks and thins
    meet at an angle. This is especially noticeable in the O and the S. The g and
    y have cursive tails....\"\r\nComments by McGrew: \"LOUVAINE series was designed
    by Morris F. Benton for ATF in 1928. It is an adaptation of Bodoni (the working
    title was Modern Bodoni), and many of the characters are identical. Only g and
    y are basically different; otherwise the distinction is in the more abrupt transition
    from thick to thin strokes in this series. In this respect, Ultra Bodoni has more
    affinity to Louvaine than to the other Bodoni weights. The three weights of Louvaine
    correspond to Bodoni Book, regular, and Bold. This series did not last long enough
    to appear in the 1934 ATF specimen book, the next complete one after its introduction.

    in 1927 by Harry and Caresse Crosby ... young expatriates living in Paris, the
    Black Sun Press was created to publish its founders\u2019 ... attempts at verse
    in beautifully bound, hand set books. ...  the Crosbys found Roger Lescaret, a
    \"master printer\" whose previous works had been primarily funeral notices, to
    print Harry\u2019s poems in a fine edition. They were so delighted at the result,
    Red Skeletons, with illustrations by their friend Alastair [the professional name
    of Hans Henning von Voight], that they decided to found a press. In a typical
    combination of high ideals and deflating humor, it was first called \xC9ditions
    Narcisse \u2013 after their black whippet, Narcisse Noir.\r\n---end quote---\r\nhttp://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/crosby/blacksun.htm\r\nSo
    perhaps a bespoke typeface for or by Roger Lescaret.\r\nDon\r\n"

    in a \"collected works\" volume, even more so because Mr. Crosby did not write
    the content shown. \r\n\r\nAside from that, if it is only the /A that is critical,
    why not use Grantham and ask someone to modify the /A for you, or download FontForge
    (free font editor) and do it yourself? Since Grantham is a free font, I'm sure
    the license will allow you to do that if you don't plan on redistributing the

  body: "Mr. Thomas, I assure you that Harry Crosby wrote the material in the photograph.
    It is from his book Chariots of the Sun (http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/psycopathia-sexualis/).
    I apologize because I inadvertently used the photograph of that page thinking
    that it was from his book Sleeping Together. Both use the same typeface. My assistant
    took the photo and I forgot that I had instructed her to photograph all prose
    poems that were not included in Sleeping Together. (See: http://www.amazon.com/The-Collected-Poems-Harry-Crosby/dp/B004CULP6M.)\r\n\r\nInformation
    from everyone has been extremely helpful. I was hoping that the typeface would
    be commercially available. Looks like it was a minor early 20th century typeface
    that was probably not used for much bookwork since Lescaret did not primarily
    focus on books. If I want to use that typeface for my press, I'll have to make
    alterations to an existing similar typeface that has an open license. All those
    leads above on similar typefaces are very helpful and I again thank Mr Thomas
    and Don for their expertise."

  body: I wouldn't hold out hope that this face is commercially available. To my eye,
    it's a real dog's dinner of a typeface, combining elements of Grasset, Louvaine,
    Bewick Roman and Graybar Book, without really resolving the differences among
    them.

  body: "Good point. No disputing that the typeface verges on Frankenfontism. The
    most striking feature is the pregnant _S_ and _s_, but this is not reconciled
    with other features such as the Louvainesque feature of making the thicks and
    thins meet at an angle, the German single story _g_, the Didotesque _y_ with the
    plumb drop vertical descender, and some of the quirky touches in the styles of
    Grasset, Bewick Roman and Graybar Book.\r\nHowever, perhaps it was appropriate
    for a press that dealt with topics that were far from conventional.\r\nDon \r\n"

  body: "I agree with Nick. I hunted in all my books and Graybar/Louvaine are the
    closest I could find. A problem is that Lescaret may have used an existing (but
    obscure to us) French typeface. I don't know about you guys, but my collection
    of information about European types is pretty sketchy. (I searched McGrew's book,
    in case it was an American type, but I didn't see it.) Then I suppose there is
    also the possibility that he may have developed his own typeface, but if he did
    he escaped the notice of Luc Devroye. That makes me suspect he used something
    that was available to him, but perhaps from an obscure foundry.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "The production runs were very short, so I believe that this is a letterpress
    font rather than something that meets the technical specs for a typecasting machine
    like Linotype. So I wouldn't rule out bespoke.\r\nPrivate presses in the early
    20th century with aspirations to uniqueness sometimes made the effort to have
    a unique typeface. Recall for example the Doves Press. In these cases vanity trumped
    profitability.\r\nMight be worth a search of the books on private presses to see
    if there is anything on Black Sun Press. \r\nfor example Hugh Ford's _Published
    in Paris: American and British writers, printers, and publishers in Paris, 1920-1939
    [1975]_ http://www.amazon.com/Published-Paris-American-publishers-1920-1939/dp/0855112123
    I trust there are others. For more leads Google \"Paris private presses black
    sun\" or visit a good university library and check their holdings for LOC classification
    Z321 and nearby.\r\nDon"
