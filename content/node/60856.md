  a font-family i created in windows the system could only identify only one the font
  (like \"headline\").\r\nwhen clickung on the other two (\"Swashes\" and \"NoSwashes\"),
  it always shows \"headline\" again ...\r\n\r\nrenaming it would be a solution, but
  that would tear the family apart.\r\n\r\nany ideas???\r\n\r\nthx,\r\nmarcus"
