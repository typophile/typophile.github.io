  body: "The foundry cut of Stymie (medium) in Boro Typographers, NY, 1963 type book
    shows that \"R\".\r\n\r\nI also found the same Stymie \"R\" in 1990 Agfa Type
    specimen book (for high-end digital imagesetters, pre-Postscript), though the
    \"E\" more closely matches the text cut than the display cut.\r\n\r\nJust confirming
    the existence of the curved leg on cap \"R\"."

  body: Wow, Norbert. Nice work. I just knew it was Stymie, but that pesky "R" threw
    me. I wonder if that cut is available digitally? I like it.
