  body: "I think this is graphically distorted, as you noted about the i-dot. It looks
    to me like it might be the default font (such as Adobe Serif MM) which your computer
    uses when you don't have the actual font installed, and it is not embedded with
    the PDF file.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
