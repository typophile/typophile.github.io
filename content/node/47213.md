  of free fonts online and now I'm looking to use them for commercial use. I can't
  seem to find where to buy the font license for these 2 fonts: Angelina and Kayleigh.
  \ Any ideas?\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know what company does sort of an overall
  font audit?  Or is it just the individual font houses that do it for their own fonts?
  \ Who would I contact to ask licensing-related questions?\r\n\r\nLegal suggestions...I'm
  in CA and my biz partner is in PA and our printer is in IL.  I was looking over
  the licenses for several companies and I'm overwhelmed with thinking that I'd have
  to buy 3 copies of each font.  The CA and PA offices are NOT going to do any printing
  of the fonts only the IL printer.  The co is based in CA, we don't need to file
  as an LLC in PA b/c nothing is being sold there. And, nothing will be physically
  sold out of the CA office because the printer in IL is going to do the shipping
  as well.  So, do you think I'd need to by 3 copies of each font?  Would one copy
  be sort of Kosher?  (The co is just me and my biz partner.)\r\n\r\nThank you thank
  you!\r\nJessica\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Harrington is from Font Bureau - it's a font bundled with various Microsoft
    products so it\u2019s likely you may already be licensed. \r\n\r\nThe two freeware
    fonts seem to be unattributed so it may be hard to track down their designers.
    But they seem to be posted to the usual sites without a license, so there doesn't
    appear to be any restrictions on commercial use. \r\n"
