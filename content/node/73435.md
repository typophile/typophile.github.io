  of mine who is doing a design project on Goth fashion labels. Can anyone offer some
  names of designers or links to their work that I can show her?\r\n\r\nFrankly, I'm
  at a loss. It's a genre I know very little about, past its typical penchant for
  using Blackletter (mostly due to Nazi appropriation). And honestly, all the typical
  band posters and skateboarder fashions I've seen in the Goth genre fall squarely
  into the cheesy category.....poor layout, muddy hierarchy, bad legibility, overly
  dramatic or contrasty color palettes....just bad design in general.\r\n\r\nHave
  any serious and skilled designers or firms taken up goth graphics and produced any
  exemplary bodies of work?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading"

    that you've got that Nazi thing totally wrong. Blackletter type comes from Medieval
    (or Gothic) origins. Maybe you confuse Goths with Skinheads?"

    counterculture created in the late 90s and early 00s by record companies and stores
    like Hot Topic for the purpose of reinforcing the us-vs-them mentality of social
    cliques. You won\u2019t find examples that look good from the mindset of a design
    teacher hung up on traditional notions of good design because the entire point
    of this aesthetic is to be condemned as ugly by people who are not part of the
    group that identified with it, thus allowing that group to wallow in their self-identification
    as outsiders. If the design started too look professional then it gets associated
    with mainstream pop culture and would no longer be commercially viable."

    the post-punk of the seventies and owes much to the Velvet Underground, Warhol,
    Jasper Johns, etc.\r\n\r\nTry examining specific instances of design irony: Blackletter
    type, excessive ornamentation, etc."

  body: Can you be more specific what you mean by "goth." That means different things
    to different people.

    it. \r\n\r\nI don't think it has anything to do with Nazis...the blackletter more
    likely comes from Goth's music roots in 80's punk and metal. \r\n\r\nWikipedia
    has an OK overview that should point you towards plenty of historical references
    to base designs off of: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture"

  body: "I agree that you'll need to clarify what you mean by goth. Since you mentioned
    fashion labels, you're probably thinking of something more recent. But when I
    think of the gothic subculture, the first thing that comes to mind is Bauhaus's
    <em>Bela Lugosi's Dead</em> from 1979. The single looks like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bela_Lugosi's_Dead_Cover_4912.jpg]\r\nYou
    can't get any more gothic, but the type alone doesn't say that.\r\n\r\nIn 1982,
    Christian Death was doing something more obvious:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Christian_Death_-_Only_Theatre_Of_Pain_5460.jpg]\r\nI
    suspect this is related to <a href=\"http://welovetypography.com/post/1322/\">black
    metal lettering</a>. Maybe that's more like what passes for goth these days.\r\n\r\nThis
    is from Southern Death Cult in 1983, and it was too lovely not to include:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BEGA46_4208.jpg]\r\n\r\nDunno,
    maybe that information will give you starting point?"
