body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is a class project: an identity for the Museum for
  African Art. I'm wondering if adding a custom typeface to the project will complicate
  it with too many elements.\r\n\r\nBelow are rough sketches:\r\n\r\n(A) My original
  logo concept: symbol with wordmark (in Verlag). Verlag is used throughout the identity
  as a display and text face. \r\n\r\n(B) Symbol with wordmark in a custom typeface
  (I haven't built out the entire font however). I like how strong the type looks
  when big and overlaid on an image, but does it clash/fight for attention with the
  symbol? \r\n\r\nMy gut says the symbol and custom face are both viable options,
  but maybe not when used together. \r\n\r\n\r\nI've been wrestling with this for
  a while. \r\nThanks so much for your feedback!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAA_A_4277.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAA_B_4924.jpg]"

  body: 'The custom face feels too geometric and suggests hi-tech a bit too much for
    your subject.  Option A feels museum-y but you could probably explore some other
    options that spoke more to the subject.  The logomark is really impressive, and
    suggests a lot that I associate with the subject.  '

  body: I'd definitely go for 'A'. Much more harmonious with the rest of the identity
    styling.

  body: 'I agree. The mark is very strong. And, obviously, the art itself will be
    very strong, so a typeface that doesn''t draw too much attention to itself is
    probably the best bet. '

    what it's worth, here was another custom face I was playing around with.\r\n\r\nOverall
    I agree that the logo should play the lead role, with a simpler typeface as a
    supporting role.\r\n\r\n\r\n=)"

  body: 'Are you trying to echo the squareness of the mark in the angular forms of
    the letters?  Still there seems to be the wrong message to me.  Too geometric,
    mechanical.  '

  body: Yes Luma, that's what I was trying to do. Verlag (pointy geometric) does that
    job decently, but I wanted to see if there was any other alternative =P

  body: "You may want to learn a bit more about type design. For example, the idea
    that in order to *look* monoline, the horizontal strokes need to be thinner than
    the vertical strokes. I'm guessing that you have made them the same thickness,
    which makes the horizontals look slightly heavier than the verticals.\r\n\r\nThere
    are some other minor suggestions I'd make, but in any case I agree that those
    styles are not as well suited to the project, anyway.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    and your ziggy zag theme too."

  body: "Your logomark looks impressive. I definitely get the tribal feeling. Besides
    you can easily transform the abstract symbol into information design for instance
    to classify wide range of things, wayfinding design and galleries. I also think
    the simple elegance of Verlag doesn't steal the lead role from the identity design.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a nice idea to experiment custom typefaces to match \u2013 a unique touch in
    my opinion. But I think your proposal takes me to the wrong eras: Constructivism,
    De Stijl, Sci-fi. Nowhere near tribal and earthy tones of the African culture."

    Now that we've solved this little dilemma, I'm motivated to forge ahead!\r\n\r\nThomas
    - yea, I knew the custom type needed lots of fine tuning. I certainly didn't take
    enough off the horozontals! Perhaps I'll work this face up in the future as a
    personal project."
