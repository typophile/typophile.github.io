body: I'd guess this is all hand-drawn but I'm thinking it may be based off of an
  existing typeface. Can anyone spot what typeface 'Wonderful' is based off of?

    Anyway, confirming hand-drawn hunch. Looks like a [[http://typophile.com/node/70274|Spoleto/Aktuelle/Athletic
    Script/Opti Sport Script]] x [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontyou/beaurencourt-fy|Beaurencourt]]
    job. Some alternatives: <strong>Vellum/Swoon</strong> (interesting but don''t
    want to give any pointer to it as it''s copyrighted by Summitsoft Corporation
    and I don''t trust this source although I can''t find any other "trusty" source
    for it), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/corien/dausby|Dausby]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/enrico-handwriting|Enrico

  body: Thanks Ryuk. Beaurencourt seems quite nice. I also found a bunch of the Aring
    Typeface's had a similar letterforms. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/castro-script/">Castro
    Script</a>, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/society-editor/">Society
    Editor</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/dollie-script/">Dollie
    Script</a>. It's quite possible the original script is just the designers own
    handwriting.
