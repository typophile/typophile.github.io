    the sample image. Dieter's is very close to the weight of the sample.

  body: "> different s\r\nYou mean and old-style s (DFR, looks like f without crossbar)
    instead of the usual s, which is an end-s in old german?\r\nThere is an end-s
    in Tannenberg, which looks more like in the sample then Brokenscript.\r\n\r\n>
    and I don\u2019t completely agree with your saying/questioning:\r\n> Similar to
    any blackletter?\r\nThat was sarcasm and a reply to that Cabazon-suggestion.\r\n\r\nI
    still think Tannenberg is closer and it\u2019s the original.\r\nBrokenscript is
    a modern interpretation (designed 1990)."

    by Underware?\r\nOf course they\u2019re not Tannenbergs but rather much more contemporary
    approaches to (fat, unembellished) blackletter.\r\n\r\nThen, they come with technical
    advantages you might appreciate when using it for an art exhibition design, like
    extensive character maps, well-mapped alternatives and ligatures and all the other
    OpenType bells and whistles. Just an idea.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what DS-Tannenberg
    has to offer, unfortunately there is not a lot of information provided. Concerning
    characters: if this <a href=\"http://www.fraktur.com/Zeichenbestand.gif\">chart</a>
    applies to DS-Tannenberg, you\u2019ll maybe miss \u2018\xC5\u2019, \u2018@\u2019?"
