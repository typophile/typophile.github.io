    title I haven&#39;t got a clue &#40;it is quite small BTW, maybe if  <BR>you had
    a bigger sample we would be able to make more of it&#41;.

    &#34;customers&#34; to not give the impression we are  <BR>laughing at them. Our
    style of humor is sometimes a bit  <BR>dense and might be mistaken for mockery,
    as Joseph&#39;s last  <BR>post seems to indicate. I&#39;m not casting any stones
    here  <BR>because I neglected to insert the appropriate smileys myself. <BR> <BR>Dear
    Joseph, I&#39;m serious now: I profusely apologize if  <BR>we might&#39;ve given
    the impression we were making fun  <BR>of you, which was certainly not our intention,
    nor was  <BR>it to hurt your feelings. I hope you&#39;ll forgive us and give  <BR>the
    Typophile Type Identification Board another chance.'
