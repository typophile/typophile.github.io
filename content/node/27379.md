    font library consisting of only TrueType fonts and that I should purchase only
    TrueType fonts from now on? Unless of course there is an Open Type version.

    True Type outlines.\r\n\r\nFrom a standpoint of practicality, any True Type font
    that is able to load on a Windows PC can also be loaded on a modern Mac running
    OSX -provided there's nothing really wrong with the generation of the font.\r\n\r\nPostscript
    Type 1 and Type 1 Multiple Master fonts are very platform dependent.\r\n\r\nEven
    still, some fonts that are sold as True Type are still sold for separate Mac and
    PC platforms. I recall this when I purchased a license for Clearview Highway at
    Terminal Design's website. I received a folder of True Type fonts, but they were
    also called \"Open Type\" for some reason on the website. The site insisted that
    PC and Mac users download their purchases from the specific Mac and PC links.
    Perhaps there is something that gets lost in platform shifts concerning letter
    spacing and other properties in the fonts."

    are not as straight forward as you make them sound (or might just be an incorrect
    interpretation of your words on my part). Nonetheless, you can't assume that everyone
    to know the true half of this topic.\r\n\r\nAnyway, OpenType is an extension of
    the TrueType format. That means TrueType is a subset of the OpenType format. One
    could say that an OpenType font is a TrueType font, since an OT font can have
    everything a TT font can have, but the opposite isn't quite true (unless I'm forgetting
    something...).\r\n\r\nWhy would Microsoft and Adobe would go to the troubles of
    developing the OT format if they (especially MS) could do it with TT?"

    then relatively new TT format, so they got a bad reputation in the graphics business.
    But I've been using TT and PS fonts side-by-side for a long time now, and have
    not encountered any problems with TT in RIPs since the mid-90s."

    fonts work just fine in print design. Any propbems you encounter with a TrueType
    font are not a problem with the format at all. The problems are with the individual
    quality of the actual individual font.  This is true of all font formats so you
    don't have to shy away from Truetype as a format anymore.\r\n\r\nThere have been
    instances where people have made conversions from type 1 to truetype and done
    a bad job of it but all the quality foundries large and small do excellent work.
    Buy the type you need based on quality in ether OTF or TT and you will be fine.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    deal with a lot of customer-provided artwork, which sometimes involves really
    wierd off-the-wall freebie type fonts gained from sites like DaFont and others.\r\n\r\nEven
    from the early 1990s it was easy for anyone to tell not all fonts are created
    equal. Buy some little \"Key Fonts\" disc for chump change and then try to use
    them. Convert the type to outlines and see all the errant control points all over
    the place -as if the type were scanned and auto-traced. Then compare it to the
    good type you had at the time, such as a Garamond BE weight bundled in with Illustrator
    4.0. Wow. It has a lot less anchor points and more smooth, gradual curves. When
    I rout it out of a 4' X 8' sheet of aluminum I have no bumps or divits on it from
    poorly placed nodes! Egads!\r\n\r\nTTF, T1, T1 MM or OTF in TT and T1 flavors
    -people can generate really good or really terrible quality fonts in any of those
    formats. Observation of quality really does need to proceed in a case by case

    sign applications like neon-illuminated channel letters.\r\n\r\nThe seemingly
    insignificant little divit at the start/end point of a letter will be amplified
    to a much larger size for outdoor use. Complicate that further by all the parts
    which must be joined in a channel letter: a routed aluminum back, notched aluminum
    returns, an acrylic face which is often trim-capped. It's not easy to bond 1\"
    plastic Jewelite trim-cap to some acrylic face if there's lots of irregular bumps
    and other digital garbage in the routed form. Very clean artwork makes life easier
    in a manufacturing environment.\r\n\r\nI'll usually not let bumpy artwork get
    so far into the production line that others in the fabrication shop are having
    to deal with it. They know my vehicle and can vandalize it as will!"

    \"Riviera\" sign featured a compromise. I had to apply a path offset around the
    actual jagged letter forms (ITC Humana Serif). This was done to provide a wide
    enough stroke to hold neon. The offset path was also edited to be more smooth
    so the trim cap process wouldn't be so difficult. The letter faces were decorated
    with translucent vinyl to preserve the shape of the original letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PicLadyAmericanaSign500_6137.jpg]\r\nSome

  body: "Bobby,\r\n\r\nThe ClearviewHwy fonts have a few OpenType features (numerator,
    denominator, arbitrary fractions) with TrueType outlines. Since they do not contain
    digital signatures, they technically are not OpenType fonts, but they function
    as OpenType fonts. The reason there are Mac and PC versions of the font and that
    we ask users to download their appropriate flavor is that when all of this went
    up a few years ago there were still several issues with Windows PC running on
    Macs (OSX was not as common then).\r\n\r\nWhen asked now, we recommend our Mac
    OSX users to download the Windows TrueType versions of the fonts. There are, however,
    a lot of sign shops out there running some pretty old software both on Mac and
    PC. More than once we've had to provide PS Type1 versions of the font software
    to clients who were still running Illustrator 8 on OS 9."

    it affects very few of us -- is that Type 1 outlines are much easier to edit.\r\n\r\nI
    know, TrueType outlines can be converted to Postscript-style vectors. They do
    change a bit when this is done. For this reason I always use a Type 1 version
    of a font. Hinting is easier to edit too. I edit most fonts I use, but I'm one
    of a few. T1 and TT look the same on paper, and if that's all that matters to
    you, either format will do.\r\n\r\nThe only advantage of TT fonts is that they
    can look a lot better on a computer screen, if the designer has taken the trouble
    to hint them thoroughly. This is not always the case, and I've seen some TT fonts
    look bad on-screen as well."
