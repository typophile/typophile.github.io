body: "I still think determination of the spaceband values is the comp's responsibility,
  but I've had to work on making a couple of OpenType fonts from old Type 1's the
  past couple of days, and did a little testing.\r\n\r\nBackground: From 1985 to 2006,
  we set type using our own implementation of TeX, where you could specify not only
  the wordspace and min-max values, but also program various penalties to control
  how TeX worked. Even with the paragraph composer, InDesign obviously uses different
  \"penalties,\"  and much less is programmable than TeX. So with InDesign, when we
  use the same ideal and min-max equivalent values, the line-ending decisions were
  different from the same text set using our old version of TeX -- essentially, the
  type set to tight, but when the \"min\" was adjusted upwards to limit the number
  of too-tight lines, the whole page set looser.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a different
  tack, and tried to determine the best \"ideal\" value by setting ragged right, vary
  the \"ideal\" spaceband value with a couple of fonts to see what was the smallest
  value that would still look good with 11/13 Bembo and 11/13.5 Fournier. These were
  re-worked fonts even in Type 1, & I may well have changed sidebearings as well as
  given them more weight & reduced the contrast, so no claims are made about the fonts
  as they set out-of-the-box. I will note that the Bembo now has a fair bit of the
  feel of hot-metal Monotype Bembo (we compared it to a Bembo setting by Stinehour
  for a paper given at the AAUP meeting in 2003). \r\n\r\nIn both cases, this worked
  out to be about 200 units, or a 5-to-em space. This due to my notion that if we
  use a higher minimum value (seems to be necessary with InDesign), the smaller \"ideal\"
  value will still lead to fairly tight lines. I'm not sure about this yet; if anyone
  cares, I'll report when some printed books come back.\r\n\r\nThis 5-to-em is tighter
  than classical settings. If you read Dowding's <cite> Factors in the Choice of Typefaces</cite>
  (London: Wace, 1957) -- I believe the appendix, but don't remember for sure, he
  recommends a 4-to-em space for Bembo. And anyone who has looked at the Wace edition
  (London, 1954) of <cite> Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type</cite>
  knows Dowding will compromise anything except tight spacing. This doesn't show in
  the later Hartley & Marks edition, but Dowding supervised the composition of the
  original Wace edition, and there are lines in there set so tightly that no editor
  would allow them.\r\n\r\nSo what is going on? Well, first of all, the H&J algorithm
  of InDesign is a bit odd, but that's what got Adobe a patent, I guess.\r\n\r\nMore
  importantly, we are kerning type now in ways that were not possible with older hot-metal
  Monotype (Linotype, dropping molds, could not have kerning in any case). With kerning,
  the letterfit is often tighter, so the spaceband can be smaller while preserving
  the appearance of the line.\r\n\r\nA contrasting factor, with several commercial
  OpenType fonts, is the kerns used with the space character itself (this is a factor
  that reduces the minimum space value that can be used). For example, with Minion
  (or maybe Adobe Garamond Pro), there is a positive kern between \"f\" and \"space\"
  -- about 30 units, as I remember. But there is a whopping negative kern between
  \"space\" and \"quotedblleft\", so much so that the string [\"f\" \"space\" \"quotedlbleft\"
  \"one\"] has more optical space between the \"quotedblleft\" and \"one\" (oldstyle)
  than between [\"f\" \"space\" \"quotedblleft\"], even though a wordspace intervenes.\r\n\r\nI
  think one shouldn't use pairs kerning around a space. You need triplets, not supported,
  to my knowledge, with any OT features. So, for example, [\"a\" \"space\" \"y\"]
  can use a kern because of the letterforms. [\"f\" \"space\" \"W\"] cannot, though
  [\"period\" \"space\" \"W\"] can -- and a hefty one, to boot.\r\n\r\nWe put these
  in when setting type, but is by preprocessing & looking for triplets, not pairs
  kerning in the font.\r\n\r\nAnyway, such \"space\" kerns limit the minimum space
  value that can be used in InDesign. I'll note this was not a factor in the re-worked
  Bembo or Fournier, since I don't use such \"space\" kerns but rely on preprocessing.\r\n\r\nAnd
  thinking on it, as I remember, Quadraat (which also sets tightly) uses a small space
  value in the font, about 6-to-em.\r\n\r\nFinally, I also had to convert an old Type
  1 bold & ultra font today. While the sidebearings of the letters were smaller than
  their roman counterparts, the \"space\" value was larger. And to my eye, about right.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    of a pair. I.e., if a pair \"A\" \"V\"  is kerned at -50, this means that the
    original total width of \"A\" is decreased by 50.)\r\n\r\nReasons for this approach:\r\n(1)
    Working with triplets would double the kerning table because in theory every kerned
    pair could be \"disturbed\" by a space inbetween them. It would be much easier
    to have the layout engine perform this task.\r\nAnd, I am not sure if every layout
    engine would apply contextual kerning (context including the \"space\" character)
    if the text uses non-break-, em-, en- or another kind of space. Proper behavior
    may not be granted.\r\n(2) If spacing adjustment is required between two glyphs,
    then it is also required if the space inbetween is wider (at the amount of the
    \"space\" glyph). Luckily, most of the time the additional \"space\" inbetween
    two glyph makes the mal-spacing almost invisible.\r\n\r\nCharles Ellertson wrote:\r\n<cite>[\u201Cf\u201D

    found -- the hard way -- that a number of my ideas solve one problem at the expense
    of creating another. Further, an \"f\" \"W\" kern wouldn't be one I would normally
    write, since it wouldn't come up very often. Such a plan, for the greatest efficacy,
    would require kerns for many unlikely lower-case/upper-case pairs.\r\n\r\nFor
    the particularly troublesome letters, like the lower-case \"f\", I've found it
    better in OT to create a \".terminal\" which is used whenever a the letter is
    followed by a word space. For an \"f.terminal\" for example, the right sidebearing
    is increased a bit, and the upper stroke of the \"f\" shortened a bit. Seems to
    work.\r\n\r\nBefore OT, we would look for \"f\" \"space\" \"next letter\" combinations
    & adjust with the preprocessing routine. Candidates were all letters that had
    an element at the upper left corner, such as b, l, h, k, bracketleft, quoteleft,
    and a series of caps, B,D,E,F,H,I,K,L,M,N,P,R,T,V,W,X,Y. We would then add a kern
    in the file to adjust the spacing. And we may go back to this if the '.terminal\"
    doesn't work as well as I hope -- we have to preprocess anyhow, as there is no
    way to adjust spacing with some other constructions, such as when an italic \"l\"
    is followed by a roman close paren, or roman close quote (or roman anything, for
    that matter).\r\n\r\nBut the preprocessing of files is a typesetter's solution
    & nothing a font designer can help with. A few terminal letters, on the other
    hand, could be a good font feature.\r\n\r\n<cite>Charles Ellertson wrote:</cite>\r\n\r\n[\u201Cf\u201D
    \u201Cspace\u201D \u201CW\u201D] cannot, though [\u201Cperiod\u201D \u201Cspace\u201D
    \u201CW\u201D] can \u2014 and a hefty one, to boot.\r\n\r\n<cite>Have you tried
    this? For the OT feature, it does not make a difference whether a glyph is an
    \u201Cf\u201D or a \u201Cperiod\u201D.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes and no. I've used these
    constructions with preprocessing text, and would usually add about -(75/1000)
    to the \"W\" following a space preceded by a period or comma. But these preprocessing
    routines do have some font-specific elements, and sitting at home on a Sunday
    morning, I can't remember if that is one.  Moreover, we do re-kern most of our
    text fonts, and one character that gets a lot of attention is the \"period\".
    I'm old school enough to think that a period should not be too tightly kerned
    to a preceding letter; it is not a diacritic. So in most of our fonts, esp. with
    lower case letters, a period will optically be at least at the right edge of the
    preceding letter. The lower-case \"f\" is a possible exception, depending on the
    \"f\". But another principle we have, adopted before OT gave us the possibility
    of automatic contextual substitutions, was to give the \"f\" a more natural right
    sidebearing, say -(90/1000) or so, and accept the need to kern many following
    lower-case letters.\r\n\r\nGiven that the period extends at least a bit beyond
    a preceding letter, then yes, a \"period\" \"space\" \"W\" can take a negative
    kern, whereas an \"f\" \"space\" \"W\" cannot.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes found it
    helpful to go back & think through how compositors worked with hand-set foundry
    type. You put in the smallest value you're willing to use for a word space, then
    when you add space to justify the line, you can skip adding space (or adding as
    much space) certain places.\r\n\r\nComputer-assisted composition changes this;
    instead of skipping a point when adding space to justify the line, the spaces
    are all the same, so you must make a different kind of change (a kern) to get
    the same optical effect. But the points you select would be the same.\r\n\r\nAnd
    in case it matters, I do think that computer comp, particularly with OT fonts,
    can give us better typesetting that was ever achieved with metal type, either
    hot or cold. Getting the printing right with offset presses and modern papers
    is one issue, getting a certain variableness in the letterforms themselves may
    be an issue for some, but that too is quite possible.\r\n"

    certain sequences, the period following the letter was closer to the letter that

    \"S\" and \"A\", so I would kern the pairs \"period\" and \"S\" and \"period\"
    and \"A\" and a few others.\r\n\r\nIf you do this, then on the system you propose,
    this positive kern between the period and a following capital would be applied
    when a space intervened, and that would usually be unfortunate.\r\n\r\nDoesn't

    about the \"f\" and a special \".terminal\" alternate is interesting. In fact,
    for my own typefaces I always make two \"f\"s, one with a short, another with
    a longer terminal. The first is the standard form, also used if space follows,
    while the latter is used if following letters' shapes allow. (Similar for \"g\"
    with shorter and longer ear.) Tim Ahrens does this in Lapture, his digital interpretation
    of Kapr's Leipziger Antiqua; also, he uses a \"v\" with shorter right serif if
    e.g. an \"i\" follows, so the two serifs don't connect.\r\n\r\n<cite>Given that

    punctuation--letter, for the example you give, but also for email addresses or
    urls where a lowercase letter may both precede and follow e.g. a period.\r\nThen
    the method I propose may indeed replace certain inconveniences by others. As I
    find the time, I will make an experiment and add, for every kerning pair in a
    font, an equivalent contextual kerning pair (letter--space--letter), to see how
    many problematic combinations will arise. Now I am curious.\r\n\r\nOut of interest,

    The basic program was Berthold Horn's Y&Y TeX, and Berthold got out of the TeX
    business. He and my business partner, Larry Tseng, had been working on some problems
    with TeX's imbedding color images, and that was never really resolved.\r\n\r\nThe
    whole matter of color space, both the K-plate (grayscale) and CMYK is an issue
    for us, as academic publishing has changed so much. And with TeX, there was no
    swapping out low-res images with hi-res ones by the printer. Though we prefer
    to prepare any art ourselves, there are times when we don't have enough manpower,
    or when the client doesn't have the budget.\r\n\r\nThen there was the mortality
    issue -- after a certain point, only Larry can do the programming (he wrote the

    Maybe if one of us had an extended hospital stay the other could fill in, but
    it seemed smarter to move to a situation where out of the box programs <cite>could</cite>
