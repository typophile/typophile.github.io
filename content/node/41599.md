body: "Never made a font before. I've done hand-lettering and messed around making
  logos. Actually this font started as a logo for a brass band, and then for some
  reason I decided to do up a whole font. At this point I'm wondering if it's worth
  continuing and e.g. trying to sell it on one of those online font stores.\r\n\r\nIf
  it's any good, what do I do next?\r\n\r\nPS The kerning is what TypeTool2 did automatically.
  I did some manual kerning and then lost it all somehow.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture2_5526.png]"

  body: You'll definitely want to adjust the kerning manually. A lot of type designers
    spend more time on this than on the "black" shapes, and I would venture most would
    agree that a sort-of-crappy font can be rescued into at least mediocre-levels
    if the kerning and metrics are impeccable. That said, I would also definitely
    revisit a lot of these glyph shapes. If you're going for quirky and wonky, everything
    seems a bit too rigidly lined up; if you're going for geometric simple forms,
    it seems a bit too playful. I don't think this is close to being ready for a commercial
    release yet, but if it's something you really care about it definitely has potential.

  body: "I can see the potential of this, but it still needs lotsa work to make it
    attractive enough. I would first make sure that your glyph shapes make music together.
    Maybe you should cut all the glyphs (from scratch, with your basic idea in mind)
    out of black paper and see what happens. At this stage I wouldn't put to much
    energy in kerning. \r\n\r\nMaybe you find [[http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.03.capitals.htm|this
    link]] about spacing useful."

  body: I'd suggest making it a little less structured. I think Jos has a good idea
    regarding recreating all the letters as paper cut outs. That will give it a bit
    of a randomness to it.

  body: Thanks a ton for the critique. I've already filed away this version and started
    messing around with breaking out of the boxes a bit. I had really tried to stick
    to a really strict structure and width and so on but I think it  might be fun
    to do as you suggest.
