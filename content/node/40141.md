body: On a whim I updated my icon on Friday, but after some thought became convinced
  someone else had had a very similar icon a while back. Is this right, or am I imagining
  things?

    but it is similar.

  body: I had to switch mine up to accommodate for the badge. I think a lot of people
    have. I drew this icon probably 5 years ago, thought I'd dust it off. Nice to
    hear it is still a good thing. :^) Thanks!
