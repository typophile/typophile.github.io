  up several similar fonts, but can't nail the exact one. Glypha Thin or URW Egyptienne/Typewriter
  are close but don't get the \"a\" right (should be more rounded) and the \"T\" has
  too overstated serifs and is too wide, and the \"k\" isn't right either.\r\n\r\nSo
  \u2026  does anyone here have any ideas? ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nm."
