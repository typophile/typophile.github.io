		<div class="commentbody">Didn't morrison once said: 'if typography has been done well, the reader won't notice it'. Isn't that the whole point/dilemma we have as typedesigners? If we put to much charateristics into a typeface, to make it recognizable for example, readability often suffers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On top of that: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I once had a discussion my grandpa about the need of new typefaces and typography. His answer was *Why bother?*  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Isn't that an important point as well? People prefer taking the way with the least of friction, commercialization is making the mass lazy and indifferent. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why buy fonts, if you have 20 preinstalled?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or: if people have to read stuff, they will read and buy it! Even if its giving them a headache because of the bad typography and it looks so , you wouldn't even wipe your arse with it? (newsletter, technical books e.g.). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, I must be honest, I wouldn't know how re-educate the mass! Even if Apple, Micro$ and Linux (to name the big ones) would preinstall our favorite 10 typefaces, would the standard reader tell the difference? And after 1 year those 10 faces will have been used so often, that most type designers will discuss about the same topic as we do now&hellip;&hellip;.again. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is this maybe an endless discussion? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jacques <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ps: please don't think I'm a fatalistic guy.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; if typography has been done well, the reader won't notice it <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's not 100% true (but what is?&hellip;): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. There are different layers of transparency, and those who take the Morison doctrine too seriously only see one layer, and as a result they think that something is either readable, or worthless. For one thing, there is a difference between the conscious appreciation versus the subconscious effects of type. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. It's not inconceivable that a reader can consciously appreciate a letterform, and this could add to the experience*. Yes, this ruins immersion during reading, but immersion isn't everything. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* And reading -like anything else humans do- is an experience, not just some data-collection task.

So, which one do we judge? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the end, we end up having to ask: what *is* Times?

I don't know any type designer that isn't fluent in their own language and that of typography - they couldn't do that job otherwise. Considering the colision of likely letter pairs isn't really an issue, because type designers consider *all* letter pairs (ie you make up test sheets of all posible combinations, which in the age of the intercap would include cap-lower-cap sets). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The only linguistics that may come into this process are whether a certain pair may be &quot;useful&quot; or whether a ligature is worth making (ie fffl does occur in German, but because of the grammar/structure used wouldn't be set as a four character ligature). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's for Western European Roman anyway. Where designers are unfamiliar with accented characters in Central/Estern European they would seek help and reference from people with more knowledge in those areas. The same is true of those I have known who have completed Greek or Cyrillic versions of their fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, the questions here are not of linguistics, but of established style and practice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As to Michael's original question, yes of course you should look at any typeface that you are developing in a composed form. It's so easy to do today that I'm amazed that one would even consider not doing so. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The point of a typeface in the end is not to define individually perfect looking letters - because you must end up compromising on that anyway - but to develop a set of characters that work well together in text (or display). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Building a typeface character by character is as flawed as stealing parts out of the GM plant and trying to build a Cadillac bit by bit over time (ie the trunk of a '57 with the fender of a '63&hellip;)</div>

There will of course be a whole slew of Swedish type users who neither know nor care about this preference to differentiate accent use in Swedish.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I can't help but notice how posting in general on other threads has slowed markedly since these offensive Anonymous posts began. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Indeed. And this is the typical pattern. On one other list the offender got increasingly rabid, eventually getting expelled, but was allowed to rejoin upon promising to refrain from personal attacks. Unfortunately, he picked up right where he had left off, and it took many more months of increasingly vicious attacks (including accusations of rape) for him to be expelled again. The worst part is that the entire process took over a year, during which many people ran away and the list was basically useless, and even now it's still pretty sickly. And in that case nobody was even anoymous&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, why does this happen? Clearly some people get so infuriated by certain people that trying to destroy them becomes a very important part of their lives, and for them sabotaging a public area which the reviled person frequents becomes a viable course of action. This is fundamentalist thinking - &quot;just blow it up&quot;. And anonymity helps the cause a great deal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think this forum is very valuable, and has quickly come to play an important role; the Critique area for one is a unique gem in the font world. As much as I hate censorship (and believe me I can handle any ASCII attack, with a smile), I feel there are &quot;singularities&quot; which have to be dealt with as exceptions, to preserve overall health. And I've come to question the value of anonymity: in *practice*, how many of the anonymous posts here have been more than just part of a smear campaign? I think maybe 2. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Idea #1: Show the IP address for anonymous posts (MyFonts does this - but only part of the address). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Idea #2: Anonymous posts would be allowed, but screened for offensive/deceptive content.
