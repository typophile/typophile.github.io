    is paulo.w.designer@gmail.com - if you have the e-mail from \xC1rmannsson, can
    you send to me using my email to avoid overall exhibition in these pages ?"

  body: "Hi Paulo. My email is sigurarm@islenska.is \r\n\r\nJust looked at the png
    file. What I see looks good, but it would be nice to be able to compare the P
    and p to Thorn and thorn. Similarly it would be interesting to see D and Eth and
    o versus eth if they are included.\r\n\r\nAs for Icelandic interests I would not
    mind to know if Yacute and yacute get the same kerning and metrics as Y and y.
    (I've been bumping into this problem lately. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to feed
    me with material. I can give my comments based on plain png's but my favorites
    are of course .vfb, but I know that is much to ask for. Exported eps of those
    glyphs would also be great. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Here are some points about the Icelandic glyphs. I have written about this
    for regular fonts ( http://font.is/2007/03/letur-the-making-of-thorn-thorn-eth-eth/
    )but not yet for script fonts.\r\n\r\nEth. Should be based on the D. Same metrics
    should apply. The stroke usually is fine from the hyphen but sometimes it's better
    to watch the crossbar on the H.\r\n\r\neth. This one is the hardest. Usually I
    base it on the o. In script fonts this can be tricky as the tail up needs some
    thickness that needs to be balanced against the stress on the other side of the
    o. No connection to next glyph, because when you are writing you interrupt the
    process when you to the stroke. Well, some delay making the stroke until the word
    is done but this connection looks really odd when the eth is the last character
    (which is very common).\r\n\r\nThorn. Based on the P with the belly positioned
    in the middle or just above. Size of the belly may be a little bit bigger then
    the P one, but balance is what counts.\r\n\r\nthorn. Based on the p with the stem
    going as high as the descenders. In script fonts the belly can be either like
    the one on the p but I find it usually nicer to make it rounder, draw the stroke
    to the stem and then back into a connection. Taste applies.\r\n\r\nThe other Icelandic
    glyphs are Yacute and yacute. Should use same metrics as Y and y."
