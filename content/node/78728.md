body: "Last week I saw the website of Designers & Books, a very nice initiative. But
  in the [[http://www.designersandbooks.com/books/author/genre/all/list|list of books]]
  I was very much distracted by the use of Title Case in the book titles.\r\n\r\nMost
  text editing software nowadays has the possibility to change a sentence into Title
  Case (or lowercase, UPPERCASE, Sentence case and maybe even CamelCase). Personally
  I think the use of Title Case makes the book titles swollen-headed.\r\n\r\nWhere
  does this practice of Title Case come from? Is it an American custom? Who invented
  Title Case? And who can tell me the pros of using it?"

  body: "This topic is a bit lost here in Critique; it might have gotten more response
    if placed in General.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, the use of \"title case\" for book
    titles has been normal in the English language since the eighteenth century. If
    I had to guess, I'd speculate that it derives from the earlier practice of using
    initial caps on words for Emphasis, and that by the over the course of the eighteenth
    century it was started to become normal to retain this custom for book titles
    and certain other kinds of uses (names, offices, etc.) but to use lowercase in
    most other circumstances (although that evolution continued during the nineteenth
    century).\r\n\r\nThere are some specialized situations where it is no longer the
    custom in English, especially library catalogues and certain bibliographic styles."
