  body: "Here\u2019s what the site you linked to says: \u201CFor the launch of the
    website, a bespoke typeface called \u2018Colorplan\u2019 has been developed. The
    font delivers an elegant, crafted and idiosyncratic character with a light and
    delicate impression. Characters of particular interest include the lowercase \u2018g\u2019,
    uppercase \u2018M\u2019, and the numerical character set.\u201D In other words:
    custom, not available for licensing, sorry."

    href=\"http://vllg.com/klim/national\">National</a>&nbsp;\u2013 a very well executed
    typeface, to my mind even better than the Colorplan one. Maybe other people can
    come up with more similar stuff."
