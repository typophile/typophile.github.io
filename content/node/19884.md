body: "Hello,\r\n I'm currently working on a comic book and\r\ndoing my own lettering
  by hand.  I'd like to create my own font, using\r\nmy own lettering (by hand, all
  caps), so when I type out my stories on\r\nthe computer, I could print it out in
  my personalized font.  I was\r\nhoping I could write out the alphabet ten times,
  so when I type out my\r\nfont it would randomly select a different letter \"A\",
  so as not to\r\nlook too uniform, and more hand drawn.  (i.e.: aaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbb\r\ncccccccccc...etc.)
  Does this make sense? Is there any solution to this ? \r\nI would really appreciate
  some advice.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"
