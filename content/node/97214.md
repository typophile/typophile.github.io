body: "While poking at the unfinished parts of a face that is <em>still</em> not ready
  for release, I'm taking another look at the core alphabets and wondering if they
  need to be reorganized. It's a unicase which has cap and lower forms for A/a, E/e,
  N/n, U/u, and Y/y, and caps for the rest. These are all lining. But I also have
  descending swash-tailed versions of J, Q, and R, which at present reside in the
  capital slots. Should I move them? Because this is my thinking:\r\n\r\n1. Users
  may want to set it as no-nonsense allcaps, and will want that to be as easy as turning
  on capslock.\r\n2. Still, most users who want the unicase will probably want solid
  lining, too, as easily as <em>not</em> pressing shift or capslock.\r\n3. But duplicating
  the first J, Q, and R and relegating the second to an Opentype feature is just erecting
  barriers to people who aren't using InDesign \u2014 still a significant part of
  the market, I think.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? How would you want it if you were
  using it?"

    is in the name, it makes a nice showing."

  body: Thanks, I think I'm convinced. I'll move the tails to the lowercase. Then,
    to use them with capslock on, shift would still work. For those who want to try
    the face on a longer piece of normal text and not accentuate every single r, I
    can make an OT alternate set of the lowercase.

  body: "The <em>case</em> feature kicks in with Caps Lock or selecting all capitals,
    but not when using the  Shift button. That\u2019s nice for OT savvy application,
    but surely not bulletproof. You could write a <em>calt</em> feature that checks
    if the pre- and proceeding characters are capitals (or punctuation/spaces), and
    swap the swash variant for a straight capital variant. The downside is: what if
    someone wants to write a word in all caps including your swash?"
