  body: "Wow, this is very nice!\r\nI really like the slight waisting in the stems
    and the corners inside the counters. I'd like to see how it works in paragraph
    setting.\r\nVery impressive for a first font! Are you self-taught? "

    i'm wrong but\r\none thing i see is the lowercase s\r\nit seems to be a bit too
    small.\r\n(see 5th line in the text the word sua)\r\n\r\nArrivederci!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Oh, thanks. I'm not-so-self-taught: I\u2019ve attended a short course in
    Milano (Politecnico) in September.\r\nI\u2019ve uploaded a new pdf with more text,
    so you can see how it works in a paragraph. My main doubt is about the consistence
    of stem\u2019s width and curve width."
