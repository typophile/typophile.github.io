  copies/copying, and for the chapter on typeface design\r\nis looking for coherent
  and well-articulated opinions. I've already\r\npointed him to the pieces by Downer**
  and Hische*** but I also\r\nsuggested getting broader and deeper with this via Typophile.\r\n\r\n*

  are two passages from his emails to me\r\nthat should hopefully guide your contributions.\r\n\r\n\"\r\nObvious
  issues include deciding when a typeface is too derivative\r\nof another face, when
  tracing or electronic reproduction is kosher\r\nand why. Type designers' statements
  about copyright and legal\r\nissues would be of help, too but how people make personal
  ethical\r\ndecisions is my main focus.\r\n\"\r\n\r\n\"\r\nIt would be interesting
  to see if anyone has any vaguely objective\r\ndescriptions of what is right/honorable/acceptable
  regarding\r\ninfluence in type design. I know that there's no unanimity about\r\nany
  given judgement but I'm not sure that there's even a consistent\r\nlogic on the
  part of any given individual.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nFire at will!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    about getting engaged in\r\na touchy topic. Hey, no guts, no glory. In fact,\r\nno
    guts, no progress.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, I wonder what the Google webfont\r\nanarchists
    (I got that term from a private email :-)\r\nthink about how far one should go
    in \"liberating\"\r\nestablished designs from their commercial homes.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    somebody recommended I bring up this:\r\nhttp://fontfeed.com/archives/new-fontfonts-ff-yoga-a-type-system-for-the-new-decade/\r\nI've
    only read part of it myself, but it seems to be\r\npossible to extract at least
    some wisdom from it.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nMy own stance can be -partially- illustrated\r\nby
    rephrasing something I wrote very recently\r\nin another thread: How much does
    what kind of\r\n\"copy\" affect the original, and shouldn't we care\r\nabout more
    than just money?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Apart from designing type i do love bicycles. The most common shape for racing
    bicycles is called a diamond shape. Because the UCI (Union Cycliste International)
    forbids other frame shapes to keep the sportive competition equal (it would be
    far better to be that strict concerning doping, but that\u2019s a completely different
    story), there is only the diamond shape around.\r\nYou could compare this diamond
    frame to the small letter a. For hundreds of years (not as long in cycling frames
    building) the skeleton of these two entirely different shapes (or glyphs) remain
    the same. I have never discovered similar forums of bicycle manufacturers hitting
    at each other because another manufacturer has copied design features for giving
    his diamond shape something that he believes would be unique.\r\nThis is certainly
    not enlightening this thread here, but when i was reading through this weird discussion
    (http://fontfeed.com/archives/new-fontfonts-ff-yoga-a-type-system-for-the-new-decade/)
    i had to think of this bicycle example. There are many many more in whatever industry.
    Just my two cents."

    many ways, it\u2019s implicit in the creative concept underlying a type design."

  body: "Yes, derivativeness (\u201Cinspiration\u201D) and originality are poles of
    the same spectrum, which is an aspect of authorship.\r\n\r\nAuthorship is an evolving
    cultural concept, like money (I have just been reading <em>The Ascent of Money</em>,
    which is why I thought of that).\r\n\r\nIt is impacted by developments in technology,
    law, economics, cultural theory, politics (e.g. the role of professional bodies),

  body: ">>\"Inspiration\" doesn't always mean derivativeness\r\nLike how I was inspired
    by seeing Fertigo to try and make a text font. My font looks nothing like Fertigo,
    but before Jos put out his font, I was unable to envision anything new being said
    in a text font.\r\n\r\nWhen I am designing fonts, I try really hard not to retread
    old ground. I would never copy outlines, or even retrace from a scan, but when
    I am using fonts for a project, I feel that I have a right to modify them in any
    way that my vision demands. As a designer, I keep in mind the maxim of Wally Wood:
    \"Never draw what you can copy, never copy what you can trace, never trace what
    you can cut and paste.\" That philosophy goes so against my natural inclinations
    that it dazzles me. Still, it amazes me that I have often had bosses who were
    willing to pay me fifty or sixty bucks worth of salary to hand letter a title
    to look like a font they could have licensed for 19$ (except font licences were
    not in the budget)."
