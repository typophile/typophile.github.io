  Imaging has added a pair of new typeface families to the ITC legacy suite of fonts.
  The new seven-font ITC Legacy Square Serif and seven-font ITC Legacy Serif Condensed
  families, extends the existing ITC Legacy suite to a total of 35 fonts. \r\n\r\nDesigned
  by award-winning type designer, Ronald Arnholm, the new ITC Legacy Square Serif
  and ITC Legacy Serif Condensed fonts area \"typographic tour de force,\u201D according
  to Allan Haley, director of words and letters at Monotype Imaging.\r\n\r\nRonald
  Arnholm said that the new designs \"suddenly came to me out of the blue that a square
  serif design was needed to round out the ITC Legacy family. As for the condensed
  serif typefaces, they turned out to be natural complements to the normal weights
  and the sans serif condensed faces I drew earlier.\u201D \r\n\r\nThe full ITC Legacy
  collection of fonts, which includes faces that first became available in the early
  1990s, is based on the Eusebius typeface by Nicolas Jenson, the French engraver,
  printer and pioneer typographer who created the design centuries ago in 1470. \r\n\r\nArnholm
  has designed more than 100 fonts that are available from Monotype Imaging\u2019s
  e-commerce sites. He is an art professor at the University of Georgia, Lamar Dodd
  School of Art. The fonts can be viewed, licensed and downloaded from the company\u2019s
  e-commerce sites: Fonts.com, ITCFonts.com, Linotype.com and Faces.co.uk. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
