body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Allegro_6480.jpg]\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI need
  help identifying the typeface used for the word ALLEGRO in this photo. This typeface
  does not appear on the Allegro Coffee Roasters site as far as I can tell. It seems
  to be specific branding for Allegro inside Whole Foods Market. I've only seen it
  at the Whole Foods on 3rd and Third. I've tried Identifont and What the Font to
  no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n"

  body: 'Agree with Don on customization, not on base. Can''t be Franklin Gothic to
    me, mainly because of /G and /O external (left) outline which looks like a straight
    line on your sample and curved on FG. To me, that''s either [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic|Trade
    Gothic]] (Condensed) Bold or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alternate-gothic-lt|Alternate
    Gothic]] #3.'

    this response:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI've reached out to Allegro and here is the response
    they gave:\r\n\r\nIt is a customized semi serif based on Trade Gothic. \r\n\r\nHope
    that helps!"
