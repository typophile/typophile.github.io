  around on a few of the design blogs recently. I am interested in using this particular
  font (Mercury) in an upcoming project. I think it is quite nice, and whilst similar
  to typ1451, it has a much nicer feel to me.\r\n\r\nWas just wondering what you guys
  think?"

    Mercury (Experimental 290), ca. 1949."

    bland, but maybe it's just that I didn't especially like rounded typefaces*. Most
    often they retain too much of a \"web 2.0\" vibe.\r\nBut, as always, it depends
    on the specifics and needs of the project at hand.\r\n\r\n*  Exception: http://www.omkrets.se/typografi/"
