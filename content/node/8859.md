  body: 'It&#39;s a rather complex process to explain here. Sort of like asking &#34;How
    do you play a flute?&#34;  <BR> <BR>I would suggest reading Chapter 8 in the FontLab
    manual &#40;Multiple Master Fonts&#41; and then come back here if you still have
    questions. <BR> <BR>Or, have you already designed a Multiple Master font in FontLab
    and are just having problems generating it? <BR> <BR>FYI #1, you can <i>only</i>
    make Multiple Master fonts in PostScript format. You generate it the same way
    you would a normal PostScript font, except that FontLab asks you whether you want
    to generate it with single or multiple masters. &#40;&#34;Single&#34; meaning
    a &#34;normal&#34; PostScript font.&#41; All of this assumes you have set up multiple
    axes in the font first. And, of course, all of this is explained in great detail
    in that chapter in the FontLab manual. <BR> <BR>FYI #2, you can use Multiple Master
    fonts in MacOS X, but they only work in applications that support them &#40;e.g.,
    Illustrator, etc.&#41;. The old Adobe utility for generating instances should
    still work &#40;in Classic&#41; but I haven&#39;t tried it. You can also generate
    instances from FontLab in any format you like, including OpenType.'

  body: 'Two more things:  <BR> <BR>1. FontLab Studio 5 will internally support &#34;multimaster&#34;
    TrueType fonts. You will not be able to generated a &#34;shipping&#34; &#34;MM
    TT&#34; font but you can work with quadratic curves in MM mode, which can be very
    helpful for hinting.  <BR> <BR>2. Mac OS X has native support for so-called TrueType
    GX/AAT Variation fonts. They are part of GX/AAT, the Apple-only advanced typographic
    layout system that is used in native Mac OS X applications, e.g. TextEdit, Pages,
    Keynote. Currently, there are practically no tools for building the TT variation
    fonts and there are very few fonts built that way. One of them is Skia that ships
    with Mac OS X.  <BR> <BR>FontLab Studio 5 will support opening TrueType GX/AAT
    Variation fonts but will not generate them.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch
