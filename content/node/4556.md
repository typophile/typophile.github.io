body: Hello... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on a corporate identity for Microfluidic Applications,
  a group that is selling microfluidic technology for industrial applications. This
  is a new field of technology that uses alternating current in micropumps, and can
  be used for medical and industrial purposes, such as diagnostic home test kits...my
  apologies, this technology is rather esoteric. <BR> <BR>The idea is a chip, one
  of the key components of their technology. I played around with using wells and
  other chip-like elements. I want to keep the letters are readable as possible, without
  the lines interfering. Please pass along any suggestions. Thanks. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: loose the &#39;chip&#39; lines. Too literal and cliche. I think the type in
    a blue box is enough. Not terribly excitint, but this is microfluidics we&#39;re
    talking about ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>If you want to work with some visual metaphor,
    maybe play off the &#39;fluid&#39;

  body: Hrant, I like the concept of Identification, but I think an individual circle
    with its own ornaments might be a bit gimmicky.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps use Identification,
    but edit it so that &#39;MFA&#39; is enclosed within a single oval &#40;or circle&#41;
    rather than three. And I&#39;m still not sold on that Morse code.
