  body: "It looks hand drawn to me.\r\n\r\nThere are variations in common letters,
    and the angle of \"radiation?\" varies all over the place.\r\n\r\nIt's from 1976,
    so it ain't type on a path. I think you'd probably have to slant a script font
    backwards to get it to work like that as well.\r\n\r\nRichard"

  body: Thank you for your reply. I figured it was hand drawn, but I was also looking
    for suggestions of a typeface to use to get a similar feeling. The closest I've
    found so far is Monterey.

  body: "Sorry I meant to mention Monterey, but I got distracted.\r\n\r\nIt's the
    S and W isn't it? but it doesn't have the contrast, you need something more like
    Palace or Commercial script for that."
