		<div class="commentbody">Well, I'm not sure what you mean. You can't create a text face from that. Long pages of 10pt text in a blackslanted, loopy style of lettering would never work. Text faces are supposed to be invisible. <BR> <BR>But if you meant TYPEface, of course you could develop a typeface from this. In fact, I hope you do! Just keep in mind two differences: the difference between display sizes and text sizes, and the difference between type and lettering. <BR> <BR>Typefaces, or more explicitly fonts, are little computer programs, almost machines of their own, which can be used by anyone to form any combination of letters, words, lines, or pages. Lettering is the creation of individual letters, usually by some sort of hand technique. Grafitti is an excellent example of lettering.  <BR> <BR>In lettering, it is more common than in type for the individual letters to be different. Every time the letter &quot;e&quot; appears in a lettering piece, it is a little different than the one before it. In type, this is usually not the case (although now it is easier to create alternates and ligatures and such which have the potential to make some typefaces more like lettering). <BR> <BR>What you are showing here is a design for a display typeface, based on grafitti-like lettering. <BR> <BR>I like the big loops that you have in the B and the R. Would it be possible to bring this element into any other letters? maybe numbers? will you be creating an upper and lowercase, or just a unicase (as this seems to be now)? <BR> <BR>I also like that you are thinking about a type &quot;family&quot; as is evident from what you have shown here with the 5 different weights. <BR> <BR>Keep up the good work. I'm still confused about the whole &quot;text&quot; thing. Are you really saying that you want to create a workable &quot;text&quot; face out of this? What kind of applications would you like to see this used in?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you are successful at creating a hand written typeface, yet this has no relation to &ldquo;graffiti &ldquo;style besides the fact that it is closely kerned. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I enjoy seeing attempts at typefaces from fellow &ldquo;writers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although there are no &ldquo;real&rdquo; rules to graffiti, consistant style shows experience.</p>
<p>For example:
-M: it seems as if the heavier the wieght, the sloppier it gets.
-B&amp;R: they are both consistant with eachother, but not with the other letters
-G&amp;E: hits weird angles not found in the other letters
-S: too much white space. not a very good rendition of modern graff. Does not follow the condensed feel of the other letters.</p>
<p>&hellip;hope this helps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>man I took forever to reply to this. Sorry Tiff</p>
<p>Pizza dude&rsquo;s stuff is just not accurate in comparison to the level of graffiti handstyles out on the streets.</p>
<p>There are certain things that ameture writers (toys) do, which is try to complicate their letters too much. They see what is going on around them and try to take elements from various artists and mash them together. Of course, in the font/lettering world, its obvious that this is not the normal thing to do&hellip;but graff is not broken down to a science, and this is something you learn in the &ldquo;field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just to give some insight on how deep the styles go, graff handstyles used to be regional before the internet came about. Now alphabets are being raped and toys copy the &ldquo;flavor of the month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I see many &ldquo;graff&rdquo; (note the quotes) fonts out there that do this same thing, not only the pizza ones, but pretty much every other one on the market. There is even a whole site dedicated to selling some really <strong>bad</strong> grafffonts.</p>
<p>However, check out &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://handselecta.com/fonts_hsjoker_li.html%3EJoker's">http://handselecta.com/fonts_hsjoker_li.html&gt;Joker's</a></a> font from Handselecta&hellip;a foundry that is doing it the right way. Joker&rsquo;s font is pretty true to his handstyle, but taken down a notch so that it will work well as an overall font.</p>
<p>*sorry Kamzo, took this subject in a totally different direction, hope that project worked out for you</p>
