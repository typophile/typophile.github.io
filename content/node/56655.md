body: I was wondering what peoples opinions were on the best version of Franklin Gothic
  (or related typeface) to use. I'd like to own one, but I'm confused about which
  to buy.

  body: "Best version imo is ITC Franklin Gothic, as it has a very wide range of weights
    and widths, therefore is very versatile. Only a shame that oldstyle numbers aren't
    included, which limits it's use somewhat.\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

  body: "David Berlow recently did a complete revision called now [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/ITCFranklin|ITC
    Franklin]]. It is more consistent and harmonized throughout. The Pro version does
    not have oldstyle numbers, however (for some reason, no one has ever seen fit
    to design these), but it does have fractions, superiors, inferiors, and a cool
    unicase stylistic set.\r\n\r\nAvailable from both Font Bureau and ITC (plus all
    their resellers) in a variety of packages, or a la carte.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    not easy to come up with good OSFs that work with gothics because the originals
    were designed with no intention of appearing alongside old style figures. When
    those big figures are squooshed down to work with the short descenders the result
    is not pleasant to look at, which makes them look especially out of place in a
    style of type where one almost never sees them to begin with. "

  body: We have one client who uses this font, I guess because of the numbers. Bear
    in mind that the size & esp. the weight is quite different from the usual FG Condensed
    -- or at least, what I consider usual.

  body: "Thanks for your interests.\r\n\"They do exist for the condensed fonts:\"\r\nin
    1989-1990 when those were developed, ITC had a standard glyph set produced by
    URW, who did ITC's production and they did ITC Franklin Gothic's final production.
    \r\nin the recent ITC Franklin development I had the final say over glyphs and,
    agreeing with Mr. Puckett,  I don't like os figures in gothic faces. \r\n\r\n\"...but
    I\u2019m confused about which to buy.\"\r\nHow do you plan on using it?\r\n\r\ncheers!"

    it for titling mostly.\r\nAlso, is it bad that I sort of like how \"digital and
    soulless\" Franklin Gothic 2 is?"
