  are there any rules as to how many words capitalized, a limit or just what feels

    or (better) \"all small-cap lead-in.\"\r\n\r\n2. If you wish to do it and can
    do it well, why not do it? If your phrase \"out of use\" refers to style or fashion,
    just don't worry about that.\r\n\r\n3. Depends on the overall design.\r\n\r\n4.
    Now this is the important part of your query, foggy. Far too often designers or
    editors issue a specification something like \"first 4 words in opening sentence,
    all small caps.\" So, the paragraph starts with a sentence such as \"I was not
    born in a tent in Canada\", and if you follow the spec you get the all-cap lead-in
    thus \"I WAS NOT BORN in a tent in Canada.\" And that just looks a bit silly,
    because the writer obviously had been born. So keep an eye on the syntax and the
    meaning of the chapter opening para.\r\n\r\nI use this design device quite often.
    It can require a lot of hard looking and thought, particularly if a book has a
    lot of chapters. Ideally you'd be able to keep the all-cap phrases to a somewhat
    similar length, but that rarely happens. You might start one chapter with 3 short
    words, and the next with 6, including a long one, to get the meaning right. But
    will it look OK? You have to decide. Once I got lucky and was able to set the
    entire first line of every chapter in tracked small caps, and they all had good
    syntatic sense. I hardly expect to see that repeated.\r\n\r\nAll small capitals
    will most often look better than all full capitals. & then give them some letterspacing
    so they can breathe a bit.\r\n\r\npowers"

    far as I know, usually it's done with (true) small caps rather than caps."

  body: "And you can easily do it in InDesign with nested styles on paragraph style.
    I use it all the time.\r\n\r\nWhen nested style doesn't have a fixed length (as
    in number of letters, words, lines) I usually end nested style with N-space, because
    it's easy to type (Ctrl-Shift-N). But you can also use the \"end nested style\"
    special character accessible from context menu or Type menu... But it's more cumbersome.\r\n\r\nIf
    N-space is too wide you better put a keyboard short-cut for \"end nested style\"...
    It'll make your life easier.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
