  The "Miller" portion, I've found, is a more of less a dead on match for the Draft
  Beer Font. Certainly appreciate any information on this. Regards!

  body: Hmm... actually the Edwardian Script ITC font is extremely close to the "Champagne
    of Beers" logo, really just need to figure out what comes close to the "High Life"
    logo.
