  says \"Orientation - Station - etc.?\"\r\n\r\nAlso, the word DHARMA in the logo
  looks handwritten; what would you use as a font for a close approximation?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/203-orientation-01_5101.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/654px-Pearlorientation2_4479.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!"
