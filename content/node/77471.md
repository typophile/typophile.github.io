body: "I'm designing an invitation for a client, and I think they are looking for
  something very foreboding and powerful, their logomark looks like a somewhat gimmicky
  russian face. I set the type in DIN but they want something 'more square' - trying
  to find a tasteful solution, any suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    Geogrotesque, Skilt Gothic, Locator, Antenna. More daring: PT Vielzweck or ITC
    Conduit (sorry, can''t link at the moment, but most should be found on MyFonts
    or with google)'
