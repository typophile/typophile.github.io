  through endless pages of dafont.com.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what either of these
  two fonts found on the attached image are?\r\n\r\nThe top looks similar to a Bauer,
  but I know it's not and the bottom looks like it could be a font found on dafont's
  Fancy > Curly section, but I know it's not there.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
