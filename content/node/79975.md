  body: "Every style by every lettering artist had/has its own idiosyncrasies, and
    very few of these myriad personal styles were/have been turned into fonts. \r\n\r\nAnd
    the lettering artists would also modify their styles all the time, they weren't
    robots.\r\n\r\nSo it's probably better to narrow down your selection to a few
    fonts that are close in feeling, and choose the one that best fits the particular
    project you are working on, considering, for instance, the issues of x-height
    and line-breaks as they relate to the copy you have to work with in the document
    format.\r\n\r\nBut if you are really in love with this particular lettering, why
    not digitize it? The \"Speedball\" style is quite easy to render\u2014draw a path
    and stroke it."

  body: Justin, photolettering could have one or more alternates for any given character
    in the days of hand-assembled or handset phototype.

    to give typography the irregular look of hand lettering.\r\nThat idea belongs
    to the OpenType era.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
