  this font. It's from the logo of Craig Lawrence, a London-based fashion designer.
  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://craiglawrence.co.uk/images/craiglawrence_logo.jpg\">\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for the font that 'LAWRENCE' is spelt with. I've been through IdentiFont
  and a few detector apps, but they all get one feature or another wrong:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The
  central peak of the W is lower than its arms.</li>\r\n<li>The ends of C are at an
  angle.</li>\r\n<li>The right leg of the R does not extend beyond the width of the
  loop.</li>\r\n<li>All strokes appear to be of equal weight.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much for any help!"
