<div class=commentbody>Brandon...From what I've seen and heard, the word 'experimental', <br>as it applies to type, bugs a lot of people for some reason. <br> <br>You'd have to hit up google, but if I remember correctly, <br>Jonathan Hoefler had a good quote that attempted to define <br>what is actually experimental...I think he said most of what is <br>supposed to be experimental is not experimental...but I <br>don't remember. <br> <br>Maybe it was in Texts on Type. <br> <br>Also, Claudio Piccinini <br><a href=http://fsd.it/thoughtype/main/ target=_blank>http://fsd.it/thoughtype/main/</a> <br>would be a great person to email. <br> <br>His email address is on the site. <br> <br>He's an expert in Keedy, Deck, Carson, Newlyn, <br>Emigre, et al. and the type scene of the 90s. <br> <br>You should check out another book by Stephen Heller... <br>Letterforms: Bawdy, Bad and Beautiful... <br> <br>see also <br>New Faces: type design in the first decade of <br> device-independent digital typesetting (1987-1997) <br>by Emily King <br> <br>archived at the typotheque site <br> <br>I like to use the word 'exploratory' to describe <br>type design that veers off into unexplored areas. <br> <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>Uhm... Hrant, how would you define a RESULT in a creative experiment. Isn't part of the charme of an experiment that you don't know the results. Although it would be nice to have an ex-post-analysis of, say, the 80s/90s post-digital-typographic-experimentation, I don't think it should matter to those who DO the experiments what is the actual outcome of their work. I think in experimentating, the process, the finding-out-about-things or the plaing-around-without-things is very much in the foreground, it is very much an explorative, not a teleological animal. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Here I go agreeing with Hrant again: a result I'm not keen to analyse. <br> <br>Experimental is typically used, in reference to type design and typography, as a lazy term to <i>avoid analysis</i>. Unorthodox design is explained away as 'experimental', often as a means of ducking criticism of the results. There is a presupposition that all experiments are successful experiments, justified entirely by their experimental nature rather than by either their goals or their results. True experimental design follows an experimental path: hypothesis, procedure, analysis. <br> <br>If you want to see amazing experimental type design and typography, take a look at the work of the Didots and Bodoni.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>I think in experimentating, the process, the finding-out-about-things or the plaing-around-without-things is very much in the foreground, it is very much an explorative, not a teleological animal.</i> <br> <br>Then why not speak about 'explorative typography' or even about 'playing-around typography'? I don't have a problem with either of these terms, and they are more often accurate than 'experimental', which I think should involve an experimental process that leads from an idea to observation and conclusion (not necessarily, nor even likely, a final conclusion, but a judgement). Playing-around, exploring and experimenting are three different activities: they may overlap insofar as playing-around may have an exploratory component, or exploration may proceed from a hypothesis in the same way as experimentation, but largely they are distinct in their method and in their spirit.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I question the entire concept of experimental type design. Unless it pertains to the evolution of the alphabet. Don't put your neck out though, it's pretty well behind us. Some of which has been senselessly abandoned.

<div class=commentbody>If experiment were used simply in the sense of 'trial-and-error' in regard to type design and typography, I wouldn't mind so much. But the term seems to have been fairly frequently used to elevate what was, in fact, stylistic play by suggesting a scientific rigour that it didn't possess. Lewis Blackwell's books about David Carson are prime examples. The same sort of thing happens when the jargon of critical theory -- itself an appropriation of scientific and pseudo-scientific terminology by way of social sciences -- is applied to graphic design: its main purpose seems to be to make designers feel important. <br> <br>We should never underestimate the vacuity of much of the design industry, and should be wary when it starts using impressive sounding words. Erik Spiekermann made this point at ATypI this year, relating how, having established a reputation as an information architect (another appropriated term), he began to receive requests for him to give things 'that information design look'.</div>

<div class=commentbody>There's nothing scientific about Carson, of course. Erik, however, actually in many ways was bringing a certain clean-yet-lively architectural feeling to corporate design and there is indeed a very Spiekermannesque look, which for a long time permeated a lot of what he and Metadesign did. His typefaces are all infused with a certain common style and his graphic design also has certain elements and principles, like simple geometrical rectangle vanishing into the bleed, distinct typography, solid construction... and a sense of playfulness that keeps it from </div>

<div class=commentbody>>> Because people besides the designer benefit only <br>circumstancially. <br> <br>How so? <br> <br>I guess we need a real-world example of a typeface that has <br>been described as experimental: HTF Gestalt. <br> <br>From the HTF site: "Gestalt is an experimental typeface (that) <br>explores this idea, most of its letterforms being indecipherable <br>out of context but far more easily read in text." <br> <br>So JH *does* use the word 'experimental' on his site. <br> <br>>> I think the infatuation is generally with the process. <br>Infatuation with results is usually coincidental. <br> <br>I guess I disagree here.

<div class=commentbody>There is a sense in which <i>all</i> serious type design is experimental: it proceeds from an idea, through a process of testing and refinement, and generally reaches a significant resolution if not conclusion. But something tells me that when Brandon asks for examples of 'experimental typography' he is thinking of stuff that <i>looks</i> experimental, i.e. novel and unorthodox. One way to clarify this would be to ask what is counter to experimental typography: presumably that which is based on known results, i.e. prior experiment or discovery. Above, I mentioned the types and typography of the Didots and Bodoni as examples of experimental typography, and if we no longer think of a block of text on a relatively narrow width, with generous leading, set in a Didot or Bodoni type as 'experimental' it is because we have analysed and understood the results of that experiment.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is a very interesting subject. <br> <br>I think it's safe to say that all type designers worth their salt experiment permanently.

Just because a thing works or sells well or looks fairly commonplace doesn't mean it's not experimental. <br> <br>In R&D departments all over the world, all sorts of people are experimenting as I write.

<div class=commentbody>Brandon, don't let the intellectual banter scare you. (Although <br>I agree with a lot of it.)

<div class=commentbody>I have this thing called a Korg MS2000. It's a MIDI-controlled analog modeling synthesizer designed to make lots of obnoxious noises in rapid succession. I poke at it about once a month or so. I don't play it--I'm not a musician--I just twiddle the knobs and approximate tunes, basslines, and something the kids today call "grooves." Which is different than the Susan Sontag kind, I think. Anyway, I would have called the resulting recordings "experimental music:" a few years ago when I was more overconfident. Now I just call it "obnoxious music" cos that's what it is. Except maybe for the "music" part. But it's fun to make! <br> <br>I couldn't agree more with Mr. Hudson about humanities and social sciences. These tedious, insufferable ho-dads presume to adopt this ersatz scientific-sounding jargon to inflate their worthless, totally subjective, self-involved yet publicly funded work in blatant service of this or that completely transparent agenda which they nonetheless deny without fail. <br> <br> For more on this I recommend the book <i><a href=http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/gposgsub.html#AAT>Fashionable Nonsense</a></i> by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont and anything by David Stove or Roger Kimball. <br> <br>But I confess I never thought twice about using the word "experimental" to describe type or typography, which now in hindsight seems a mistake. Thanks for the reminder. Then again I won't get too worked up over what's often just semantics. Or do I have the right definition of "semantics?"</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mr. Hudson wrote <br> <br><i>The same sort of thing happens when the jargon of critical theory -- itself an appropriation of scientific and pseudo-scientific terminology by way of social sciences --</i> <br> <br>which is what I was referring to. And I wasn't paraphrasing what he said, merely taking it and running further. I think a lot of what is called "social science" today is the result of an almost scientific process built upon entirely unscientific grounds and therefore nonetheless ultimately worthless. I don't expect Mr. Hudson to agree with it entirely... who knows... he might. But I'm sorry if you infer that I expect him to. <br> <br>Really, Sokal does a much better job of taking it apart. The main argument in this thread seems to be the abuse of the term "experimental." <br> <br>In terms of type, I'm definitely not a purist. I don't like anything that anyone called "grunge" but I have a weakness for silly decorative stuff. "Over the top," you might call it. I still love a great text face, but I like florid baroque stuff as well, especially blackletter. There are a number of interesting "experimental" blackletters, probably the most famous of which was Unger Fraktur.</div>

<div class=commentbody>When I say '<i>a lot of what</i> is called "social science"' I mainly mean parts of sociology and psychology. Geography et al I have no problem with. Sorry for the confusion there. I am talking about a small subsection of that body of knowledge that seems to expend a disproportionate amount of the available funding. I don't know how familiar you are with American academia over the past ten years, particularly in the humanities and social sciences, but in my view (and for many others) lots of scholarship in these otherwise worthwhile subjects has been wasted on things like identity politics. I ran into this issue in pursuing my own degree (in German) and ended up having to make a rather painful decision not to go to grad school. <br> <br>Nothing personal, but I get really tired really quickly explaining the problem, because it's been covered so well elsewhere already, so please just consult the Sokal book I cited if you want to explore this more. Or read any copy of <i>The New Criterion</i>.</div>

Though, after "hardcore" structuralism, many clever persons know it had limits and was to be considered as a part of something which included primarly a human way. But throwing it all is dumb. <br>Read Loic Wacquant for good french sociology </div>

<div class=commentbody>>thinking isn't very fashionable in the US. <br> <br>As usual, Hrant's anti Americanism has little relation to reality. America has many thoughtless and ignorant people, and many thoughtful and brilliant people. Including those who largely invented the computer industry, for a start. <br> <br>>stopped reading a while back when everyone started to philosophize <br> <br>Brandon, sometimes knowing a little philosophy and history of ideas can help you. (Don't go and confirm Hrant's prejudices about us Americans!) <br> <br>In this case, the word 'experimental' is sometimes used where 'avant garde' would be used. This is a specific tradition where it is believed that making progress means 'shocking the bourgeois'. There are other kinds of innovation. The bauhaus was once consciously 'avant garde' and made a contribution, though probably also did harm. But the art nouveau and art deco movements were, I believe, not 'in your face', but popular with the well-off of their day. And they too were important additions to type as well as other fields. </div>

<div class=commentbody>> America has many thoughtless and ignorant people, and many thoughtful and brilliant people. <br> <br>I've never said most Americans are stupid - because that's not true. What I said (which is a reality most of the world -and many Americans- know to be true) is that American culture puts down intelligent, objective discourse, in favor of things like servile patriotism and big biceps. Ask any bright high school kid for example. <br> <br>It seems you're developing quite a knack for fiction - you should write a typographic fantasy novel. Like where Adobe Poetica is a valiant white knight. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>And Derrida and Foucault aren't the same thing. At all.</i> <br> <br>I didn't say they were, I was pointing out that both have had a major influence on North American Academia (as has Lacan, Baudrillard, Barthes and others). It wasn't necessary for Foucault and Derrida to have the same philosophy for both to feed the 'hermeneutics of suspicion' that dominates academic discourse in the humanities in North America. In fact, one could argue that the paranoid departmental and sexual politics of most universities here is the perfect synthesis of Foucault's obsession with power and Derrida's deconstruction of truth.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>American culture puts down intelligent, objective discourse</i> <br> <br>Insofar as American culture is mass popular culture, I have to agree with Hrant. It is not that Americans don't think, but that thinking is unfashionable and kids, in particular, are encouraged not to think, by their peers and by youth media, if not by their parents and teachers. <br> <br>There are, of course, and always have been, cultures within America which are not mass popular cultures. I don't think it can be denied that the current trend in the USA is a reduction in the respect shown to the cultures of learning and knowledge, and a kind of distortion of democratic ideals wherein the populace are encouraged not to look up to and emulate educated people but to despise anyone who isn't just like themselves.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Matha, see the new thread for general comments about the difference between French and American academia. In specific answer to your question: <br> <br><i>How could one explain the absence of the same sort of politics in France?</i> <br> <br>Absence of fertile cultural ground, including different attitudes to sexuality; systemic conservatism in the structures of French education; lack of an impulse to synthesis -- more likelihood of stressing the differences between Foucault and Derrida, rather than stressing how both challenge patriarchal thought structures within repressive heterosexual space. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>
