  tomorrow - and maybe again the next day. \r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any BPL/Dwiggins
  related advice for me? \r\n\r\nI am also going to go visit the Printing Museum while
  I am here.\r\n\r\nCome to think of it any comments about Typographic research/tourism
  for the Northeast and Boston in particular you might have are also more than welcome!\r\n\r\nFeel
  feel to write me offline if you prefer.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    archives at BPL. Paul Shaw knows those archives like the back of his hand, but
    I believe he is in Europe right now and might be difficult to get in touch with.
    I am personally in love with his marionettes. Make sure you spend time in that
    room, which also contains other items from his study. Very cool. Ask for permission
    to take photographs. Their stated policy forbids photography, but they give permission
    on a case-by-case basis. I believe no flashes are allowed in the marionette room
    and the lighting is not ideal, but you should still be able to get great shots
    with your fancy gear.\r\n\r\nRoberta Zonghi used to be the contact there, but
    I am not sure that she is still in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Dept. She was
    a wonderul resource. If she is no longer there, whoever is in her place should
    be able to help you. Call in advance and tell them you're coming so they can be
    ready to help you. The staff is really wonderful, and enthusiastic about their
    holdings.\r\n\r\nHave a great time!"

    her place. I'm not sure who else there personally knows the Dwiggins Collection
    well. But they're all helpful people and will do what they can to assist you.\r\n\r\nI
    replied to your e-mail, Eben. Give me a call if you need help trying to figure
    out which box something you're looking for might be in.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention
    that you might also want to get in touch with Larry Oppenberg while you're out
    there. He could give you a good orientation to Linotype material in the Museum
    of Printing.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

  body: "I went there a couple of years ago while on vacation. It was a little awkward
    because they acted like \"why does this kid (I was 25 at the time) want to see
    the Dwiggins collection? Once I explained that I design type for a living, they
    relaxed a little. I just showed up and didn't call ahead so maybe think about
    calling ahead so they can prepare. Also, definitely get a library card. They would
    only let me spend about 20 minutes with the collection without one. I'm going
    to the Newberry Library in Chicago next week and have already exchanged emails
    with the Custodian of the John M. Wing Foundation who was very nice and welcoming.
    I\u2019m super excited to browse that collection. In retrospect I wish I had handled
    the BPL situation differently and will have to make plans to get back there to
    spend more time with it. Good luck!"

    like things I have seen on old book covers and advertising from from the 1920s.
    Is your intent text or display?"

    spending time with or looking for there? What did you find useful?
