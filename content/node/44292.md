  with the typography on the ads. The typefaces I'm using right now are Farnham Italic
  Swash for the headline and Dolly Regular for the subheadline and with the logo as
  a tagline. I think it's really boring looking. Do you have any suggestions for me
  what to do typographically?\r\n\r\nthanks for any response!\r\n"

    a school project. but my teacher isn't a big help.  i changed the spelling mistakes
    (sorry, it's not my native language). \r\ndo you have any ideas for \"complete
    different\"? do you think typographically I should go more scripty or sans serif?
    how can i make that concept work?"

    of the product, you should use whatever type and imagery you think suits that
    market. If you are free to invent that intended market, then, again, use whatever
    type and imagery you can defend as appropriate. \r\n\r\nIn this case, if you were
    told, or decided you were marketing to an older, perhaps retired design esthetic,
    that is still looking for exotic offerings of that old style. Except for the spelling,
    grammar (it is redundant to say \"...to find you...\", and \"...for your home),
    and the carpet that obscures the furniture truck at any distance, I'd say go with
    it. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "They strike me as ads aimed at winning a design competition, not ones aimed
    at selling furniture. This has high marks for creativity and practically 0 for
    effectiveness.\r\n\r\nSince your professor clearly isn't doing his/her job, I
    will offer this. Before even starting to design a furniture ad, go to a library
    that has consumer magazines on file, and go through some for at least three hours.
    You should be able to find hundreds of furniture ads. Sketch the ones you like,
    or take cell phone pix of them (please don't tear the magazines).\r\n\r\nThen
    take a look at ads for a half hour each from magazines from the 80s, 60s, 40s
    and 20s. \r\n\r\nAfter this five hours of research you will know what you want
    to do in an advertisement. "

    about the phrases eclectic delivery and exotic treasures. I think you need to
    rethink the wording of those.\r\n\r\nThe furniture truck and lampshade boat are
    great!\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "Thank you all for response. I still don't have any ideas what to do about
    the typograhy. For me the type seems too boring because it is pretty much the
    same style than the furniture and that adds the oldstyle feel. \r\n\r\nI want
    it to be a younger feel because my target audience are people (mainly women) from
    20 to 40 years that love the victorian style and also forign furniture. It's kind
    of a mix between urban outfitters and an antique store. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking of
    a sans serif to give it a younger feel but sans serif is always assosiated with
    modern furniture for me and i don't know how to bring it together with this advertising
    imagery and what typefaces i should try out.\r\n\r\nmaybe you could give me some
    type ideas.\r\n\r\nthank you. a\r\n\r\n"

  body: "sharon, thanks for the link. it's a really nice website. they have exactly
    the kind of interior that nest is going for. \r\n\r\nkatharina, why does the logo
    look incongruous to you? i'm actually really happy with the logo including the
    logotype. it's an expressive logo that means it's all handrendered. i might work
    on the n a little thoug. i choose to go this direction because the handmade feel
    fits with the furniture style that nest is selling and the unperfectness is perfect
    because it makes it more personal and charming. \r\n\r\nafter a long time struggeling
    with the typography i finally found a solution. i found it much more difficult
    to deal with type on an illustration than on photography.\r\n\r\nthanks for all
    your critique."

  body: "Hi, Annette, first of all: I like the picture.\r\n\r\nNow for the nest. Maybe
    I am compulsory, but I like the type to took tidy. So the intentional imperfections
    of the handmade \"nest\" next to a digital antiqua seem to clash. - By imperfections
    I mean for instance the first stem of the n is lower than the curve, it looks
    chopped. The fat parts of various stems are unequal. But keep in mind I am not
    a typographer, so this is what the eventual consumers might feel.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck to you!"
