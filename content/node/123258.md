  restaurant and am in need of some suggestions. \r\n\r\nI'm trying to stray away
  from obvious Asian-stereotypical fonts, but rather something classic and clean with
  a slight hint of Asian influence. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Right now
  I am pairing Century Gothic with Palatino italic and while they are quite nice together,
  they're giving a much more western (perhaps an Italian restaurant) vibe."

    a Latin subset in Chinese and Japanese fonts using a light version of common Latin
    fonts.\r\nIf you have Windows, check the installed East Asian fonts for some examples.\r\nDon"

    results in using Adobe Jenson Pro on the same page as traditional-style kanji/hanzi
    characters.

    trace of the pen is palpable and intrinsic.
