body: "I'm making a logo for a Mexican food delivery service that caters to tourists.\r\n\r\nI
  attached some W.I.P's.\r\n\r\nShe actually already approved the 2nd attachment.
  However, I didn't try many variations since it was a rushed logo but I decided to
  make some today.\r\n\r\nI definitely like the 'V' more in the 2nd attachment but
  I like how more of the letters touch the baseline, especially the 'R', in the 1st
  attachment.\r\n\r\nWhat do you'll think?\r\n\r\n-btw, right now I'm leaning towards
  #2 in attachment 1"

    small \"TO GO\" I suggest you clean up the forms somewhat as they become somewhat
    muddled at small sizes."

  body: I like the second one in the first attachment but I think something needs
    to be done with the two L's. They seem to leave an awkward white space which doesn't
    sit well with the other characters.
