  get stuck because there are so many typefaces that are amazing in different ways,
  it's difficult to select any and exclude others. I have an extensive collection
  of pictures of typefaces on my computer so I know what's around generally speaking.
  However, at least once a year a typeface is released that's so clever and so well
  done it makes me realize there is a lot more to do in type design besides emulating
  old classics.\r\n\r\nSo now I want to ask you if you could name typefaces that are
  absolutely impressive to you when it comes to the design from an aesthetic and technical
  point of view. This time I'm not interested in hearing what typefaces work best
  for you or which have the most features or best spacing or whatever. This time I'm
  mostly curious in the quality of the use of lines.\r\n\r\nSo in short, which typefaces
  are you most impressed by when functionality and application are not considered?"

    think it's really possible to judge only form and technique in typography without
    viewing it through the lens of whether or not it actually functions as such. Function
    is part and parcel to what typography is, and without considering function we're

    I understand we shouldn't undersell the importance of the functionality of typefaces
    (and in fact as Cory said in different words functionality is inherent in any
    typeface), and the fact that many if not most graphic designers seem to base their
    choice of typeface on what they personally like really frustrates me and even
    downright angers me at times, but I don't think this has be taken into account
    when talking among fellow type designers as I don't expect us to think that way.
    I asked what I asked with the exclusive understanding that we all value the functionality
    of a typeface as well as its beauty. Hence, I put a few restrictions on my question
    so you wouldn't all name the same typefaces that have been named on Typophile
    before.\r\n\r\nIf I would've asked about your favorite typefaces, a typeface like
    Magnificat would never have been mentioned. I'm hoping some of us are impressed
    by very specific and mostly overlooked examples of type. Mentioning those might
    make for good discussion or inspiration. I must also say most typefaces that impress
    me very much I've actually not had the pleasure to use yet. Most of these typefaces
    are rather specific in style and I simply haven't had a need for them yet.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I don't know what refusing to answer my question implies in regard to the other
    type designers who did answer my question."

  body: "<blockquote>My longer answer is that I have none because it would be similar

    or not it even ran.</blockquote>\r\nYes, and I don't accept that as an answer
    to my question because I'm asking you to disregard the notion whether it ran.
    Certainly you can say something about just the aesthetic design of a car, without
    knowing if it is a functional car at all. Does a car stop being a car when it
    doesn't move? It stops being a functional car, but you can still say something
    about the perceived beauty.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Function is part and parcel to
    what typography is, and without considering function we're really just judging
    the degree to which purposeless shapes tickle our fancy.</blockquote>\r\nNot at
    all [regarding the second part of your statement]. We're still viewing the typefaces
    as type designers. As such we can be impressed by the way a type designer handled
    the line work and structure, without making a consideration of its application
    and function. Beauty can be viewed independently.\r\n\r\nBesides, what purposeless
    shapes? I said nothing about typefaces without function. I'm saying this time
    I don't want to hear which typefaces are being selected most often because the
    considerations to use a specific typeface could be many which are not necessarily
    linked to its quality. This time I want to hear which typefaces impress you most
    in terms of quality and originality. That would for example lead me to name a
    typeface like Trinit\xE9, even though I never actually used it. In fact, I may
    not necessarily find the typeface to be aesthetically beautiful (though I do),
    but the typeface sure does impress me due to the subtle details the typeface features.
    That latter bit is essentially what I'm asking. I'm not asking what you find most
    beautiful, but what has impressed you the most. I feel like you're saying typefaces
    can't impress you until you see how it's used. I find that to be a nonsensical
    statement.\r\n\r\nIf I were to turn my question around I would understand your
    answer, because if I were to ask which typefaces you find most impressive from
    a functional point of view, then you should also make a consideration of its application
    and how the functionality relates to that. There is certainly a relation between
    aesthetics and application as well, but we can simply see typefaces as objects
    of beauty and disregarding application for a moment.\r\n\r\nAre you saying there
    is nothing to be said about the quality of lines if the typeface isn't functional?
    Are you implying you couldn't give criticism to a starting type designer's work
    until he made it into an actual font, or could you tell him his design is bad
    before it's a working typeface or even before knowing what the target application
    is? The target application is an extra consideration to rate the quality and functionality
    of a typeface, but it's certainly not a requirement to say anything about the
    aesthetics of a typeface at all.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not asking what typefaces you
    consider to be most beautiful (although equally, I don't see how you can't say
    anything about a typeface's beauty) but which typefaces you find technically most
    impressive when looking at the flow of lines. How does its application relate
    to what I'm asking in any way? I feel you're stuck in the consideration of what
    a typeface should be,  but that's not what I'm asking.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>You
    asked us to name impressively designed typefaces while only considering aesthetics
    and technical proficiency. My short answer is that I have none.</blockquote>\r\nHow
    could I ask my question in such a way that it becomes a question you have an answer
    to?"

    me respond from another direction. I'm so familiar with Western typography that
    I find it impossible to divorce its form from its function. I automatically see
    familiar letters and not simply aesthetically pleasing shapes. If the letter doesn't
    fit within the sideboards of typical convention for that letter, it influences
    my opinion, even though it might be a very nice shape and work well with the shapes
    around it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I'm not especially familiar with southern

    that I actually have no insight when I do comment on scripts I'm not familiar
    with. I can admire the beauty without understanding if it's contextually beautiful
    as well. But beauty isn't an objective principle anyway. Beauty is in the eye
    of the beholder, so an understanding of the script in question isn't necessarily
    required. That's not to say it's a matter of opinion though. A lot of people's
    tastes come from ignorance. Wisdom does affect opinion. I can reason much better
    whether I like or dislike a typeface based on what I know, while I used to like
    or dislike typefaces based on feelings and vague notions of beauty. I used to
    dislike Gill Sans because I didn't understand it.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I really
    don't know what the glyphs are or what they're supposed to look like.</blockquote>\r\nIn
    this regard I definitely understand your point. However, it's too much to say
    you couldn't say anything about a typeface's beauty without considering functionality
    and context. You just did. In fact, you just did it to a script you're unfamiliar
    with, which I didn't even think of doing. So what's the trouble in considering
    beauty in the Latin script?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>With that in mind, I find the following

    it's different in a good way at all, but the style is amazing to me and it could
    certainly inspire. Do you know the name of the typeface?"
