  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there. <BR> <BR>I'm currently completing a dissertation on typography and how it has been influenced though it's different mediums. <BR> <BR>I was wondering if anybody has any good stories or things i should research on this. At the moment, these are some of the things i have talked about.. <BR> <BR><b>Matthew Carter</b>. and how the screen demanded rethinking for typography. (Focussed on Verdana, Georgia) and Bell Centennial for the phone books. <BR><i>Does anybody know how i can contact Matthew Carter?</i> <BR><b>Zuzana Licko</b> - 'Matrix' for printers, lo-res etc.. the influence of the macintosh, <b>Susan Kare</b> <BR> <BR>&hellip;Movable metal type, Road signage, electronic signage, car number plates, typewriters, outline hinting methods, bitmap methods, printing techniques, cleartype, html.. <BR> <BR>Has anybody here designed typefaces using any strict restrictions, or had to design type for unusal mediums? If so it would be great if i could ask you a few questions about your designs. <BR> <BR>Many thanks <BR>Nic Mulvaney</div>

Bil'ak mentions Matthew Carter's Charter typeface (like Licko's Matrix, it has straight serifs for 'digital economy', too. See also Haley's 'Hot Designers Make Cool Fonts'). <BR>Speaking of Carter, and Bell Centenniall, <a href="http://www.boag.co.uk/down/articles/Bell.PDF"> this PDF</a> is an interesting article, available through <a href="http://www.boag.co.uk/down/"> Andrew Boag's</a> website.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One area you might look at is type design for burned subtitles. This is a technology that uses a laser to burn text onto film, and the laser has to keep moving or you get blobs. A very difficult medium for which to design. If you are interested, I can put you in touch with Thomas Milo at DecoType in the Netherlands, who has addressed the very tricky business of making Arabic type for this technology.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I designed Beaufort, one of its defining features was very sharp serifs. That seemed like a neat idea at the time, something new I could do with PostScript.  <BR> <BR>In retrospect, the observation arose: nearly all typefaces designed in the digital era could be made using prior technology.  <BR> <BR>Relatedly, Zuzana Licko had commented, re Oblong, that reductionists of the early modern (eg Bauhaus) era could have made similar designs, but it wouldn't have occured to them. <BR> <BR>*** <BR> <BR>One of the biggest revolutions in typography happened in the early 19th century, when commercial &quot;jobbing&quot; typography (eg handbills) took off, and new genres such as fat face, shaded, 3d, Egyptian etc emerged. Prior to that typography was bookish and conservative. Pardon the sweeping generalizations! <BR> <BR>There are a few paragraphs in Typographia (Hansard, 1825?) where he alludes to this, eg p. 355.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ultralights: <BR> <BR>There were a few &quot;Typositor strip&quot; ultralights (eg Lightline Gothic), but the present growth in this genre is due to (a) being able to inspect working files at large magnification on monitors, (b) the fact that there is little degradation of image between font and printed job.

		<div class="commentbody">Eduardo  Thanks for the links - The Typoteque article is great, kinda sums up nice viewpoint. <BR> <BR>Hrant, I have looked into stencil lettering, but couldn't find much research on it. I suppose it stems from the army and the most convenient way of labeling. Now that it has become an army brand, do the army use a stencil style digital font to print material? <BR> <BR>Question time&hellip; <BR> <BR>For <i>Mana</i>, are you using a seperate font containing only the anti-aliasing, to overlay the original? <BR> <BR>The way that some flash fonts now have a technique for tuned anti-aliasing is quite interesting. <BR> <BR>Do you think anti-aliasing will always be a user end thing? or do you think this can be developed into the font platform and controlled by the fontographer? or will greater resolution technology catch up before its viable developing further? <BR> <BR>What were some of the restrictions when designing your Armenian and Arabic fonts? I'm not familier with Armenian, but with reference to <i>Maral</i> what were your influences and limitations? <BR> <BR> <BR>On the topic of anti-aliasing, have you seen Firework MX 2004, with its <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks/productinfo/features/static_tour/antialiasing/index.html#01" target="_blank">System and Custom Anti-Aliasing</a> Whadda ya think? I've played with it a bit, but can't get it as sharp as i would like. It also adjusts the kerning if you anti-alias too heavy. <BR> <BR>Nic</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For stencil lettering, check out Eric Kindel (like in Baseline magazine). <BR> <BR>Mana will be released as an outline font that renders the intended grayscale bitmaps when set at 16 PPEM only. I'll be making a 13 PPEM version of Mana too, and then a fat little 8 PPEM design called Pantagruel. <BR> <BR>Anti-aliasing (the hand-made stuff) yields a large jump in quality. The only real issue with it is gamma differences between platforms: you have to make different versions of the font. As for higher-res screens, I'll take those seriously when they finally show up en masse&hellip; <BR> <BR>For small Armenian bitmap fonts, the main issue is getting the floating punctuation not to look disasterous. As for Arabic, it really needs a lot of vertical room: 8 pixels (one of which is the talus - internal leading) forced huge structural compromises. <BR> <BR>The new Flash features seem great, but they're still only as good as the fonts. And the fonts (especially on MacOS) are too blurry when anti-aliased mechanically. You'll never get a &quot;5&quot; like that. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><b>1</b> <BR>Erik Spiekermann once described how the rounded corners of a custom face for the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/contentbkgrnd/8.jpg">Berlin transportation system</a> saved them truckloads of production time. (I can't recall how much time or even the name of the font, but I remember it helped the transportation people meet their deadline.) <BR> <BR>Essentially, the letters were to be cut out of vinyl sheets. Each individual cut for a given glyph would take time to setup and make. By designing rounded corners most glyphs could be reduced to one or two cuts. (A v, for example, with square terminals would take 6 cuts. With rounded terminals and corners it would only require a single cut. The characters with counters or dots would require only 2 or 3 cuts.) <BR> <BR>Sorry if I don't have all the facts in tidy order, but that's the gist of it. You can <a href="http://www.typophile.com/contentbkgrnd/8.jpg">see a photo here</a>. Note, the BVG is the face in question. The other faces in the family do not all have rounded corners. <BR> <BR><b>2</b> <BR>A font for Qualcomm's Brew platform (a mobile device operating system) are represented in a single bitmap. A wider font requires a larger bitmap &ndash; larger in dimensions and thus file size. The speed of the interface is directly tied to how big the font is and therefore, how wide the actual alphabet is. So, while a wider font may be more readable on these devices, one has to consider the trade offs to make so that the interface speed is acceptible. <BR> <BR>(Jared worked on the project. Jared, do you recall if this was the Brew platform as a whole or for specific devices only?)</div>

It's a great attempt, but i can't see it hard to forge. <BR> <BR>Another spoiling aspect is that it has been copied <a href="http://www.lineto.com/cont_cat.html?ID=159&amp;dir_id=60" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
