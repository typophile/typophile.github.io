body: "This is my first time posting here, after a long look on the web it seems by
  far the best place for this enquiry.\r\nThere are two versions of Zapf's \"Renaissance
  Antiqua\" available: one from the company which produced it originally, Scangraphic;
  and the other from Elsner &amp; Flake. Both are available in Opentype but the former
  is about half the price. Basic descriptions for the text (as opposed to display)
  version from MyFonts are given below.\r\n\r\n<strong>Foundry/Vendor Elsner+Flake</strong>\r\n

  type concerned the difference between the H (headline) version and the B (bodytext)
  version, which was settled quickly enough.\r\n\r\nThe full character map provided
  at MyFonts is the same in both cases although there is a difference in the glyph
  count.\r\n \r\nIf anyone is familiar with using these versions I would be grateful
  for their advice, particularly as to whether there is any compelling reason <em>not</em>
  to opt for the cheaper one! I should perhaps say that I am a small-craftsman and
  not at all informed about the computing technology side of things.\r\n"

  body: "I've just compared both versions. The outlines in both versions are not identical
    but clearly they come from the same data (probably originally URW Ikarus files).
    The Elsner+Flake-branded versions typically have twice as many kerning pairs and
    overall better spacing. \r\n\r\nThe ScanGraphic version of Zapf Renaissance Book

  body: "Thank you Adam. \r\nI had hoped that there might be someone who did some
    text setting with this face whose experience I could benefit from, but I guess
    it's just not that much used. I think I have only one book set in it, <em>ABC-XYZapf</em>.
    I've never seen any use of it in everyday publishing, I wondered whether there
    was any reason for this as it seems a very handsome design, the caps in particular
    are, to my eye, one of the most beautiful interpretations of the classical forms
    in the entire tradition -- I well remember the first time I came across them on
    the cover of <em>Hermann Zapf  &amp; his Design Philosophy.</em>"

  body: "Welcome, Gareth.\r\n\r\nThis is common. You'll find that the same face is
    released by two or more companies, sometimes under different names. Bitstream
    has done this, Elsner & Flake, Carter & Cone, Enschede vs. Monotype, etc. Often,
    one of the releases will be of higher quality (or will have more osf goodies,
    for instance) than the other. \r\n\r\nCompare ITC Galliard to the Galliard offered
    by Carter & Cone. Compare Adobe's Palatino to the countless others on the market.
    The list goes on. If you really want a quality face, a \"real deal\" to add to
    your collection, then Elsner & Flake is among your top choices. Of course, it
    all depends on your needs. Do some comparison shopping.\r\n\r\nCheers.  "

    neither Zapf Renaissance nor, for example, Today Sans go the exposure they deserved.

    (by scangraphics) was used by Doyald Young to typeset his own book \"Dangerous
    Curves\" and looks great."
