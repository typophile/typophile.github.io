    know how to talk about pricing with them. Now she asked me how much they have
    to pay and I have no idea how to price myself. we were making changes in her website
    as well but That part I have decided since was a programmer's cost. Thanks for

  body: "Yikes. That sounds like a situation where you're doing a job for someone
    primarily as a favor and any payment you receive will be more of a token gesture.
    If you didn't discuss pricing, then I don't see why they wouldn't have assumed
    it was mostly a favor.\r\n\r\nIf you think they're willing to pay \"realistic\"
    rates, figure out how many hours you worked and multiply it by $35 / 45 / 55...
    If they're a friend of the family and would feel shocked and a little taken advantage
    of for paying more than $300 for something as \"simple\" as a logo, send them
    an invoice for $200 and chalk it up to a learning experience.\r\n\r\nGoing forward,
    <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Artists-Guild-Handbook-Guidelines/dp/0932102115\">The
    Pricing and Ethical Guidlines Handbook</a> is always a good starting place to
    get ballpark estimates.\r\n\r\nThough a lot of people feel you should never lower
    your rates, when I was just starting out it seemed unreasonable to charge someone
    for every hour I worked on a project - since I was just learning it seemed like
    I might put 20 hours into something that a more experienced designer could churn
    out in 10 or less. I think that, early on, when you're trying to build a portfolio,
    it's ok to put $5000 of work into a design that you're only getting paid $1000
    for. At the end of the project you've got something representative of the type
    of work you'd LIKE to be doing, and something you can show of to clients who can
    actually pay what you want to earn.\r\n\r\nDon't make a habit of it... it's not
    sustainable or good business, but once or twice isn't bad (IMO)."

  body: "Hi EC\r\n\r\nHmmm seems like you might be in a bit of a fix not asking them
    before. Now your problem is gonna be that you've spent a certain amount of time
    where you might price yourself to let's say 100$ an hour (don't really know what
    the level of the hourly rate is in the US) and the client only sees the small
    item (logo and businesscard) and not all the work behind it. Whatever you tell
    them is probably gonna sound expensive to them while if you would inform them
    before the job started they might have checked around and found that your price
    was actually quite cheap.\r\n\r\nHow many hours did you spend?\r\nDid you finance
    the printing up front or did they pay for that directly?\r\n\r\nOn a general level
    I would price a logo and bc job in the vicinity of 3.000$ - 10.000$ depending
    on the expectations from the client, how bad I wanted the job from a creative
    point of view and the financial situation of the client.\r\nPrices in Norway are
    aprox 150$ an hour with a semi-large design firm and about 75$ if you are a freelancer.
    \r\n\r\nLogo development can run much higher than what's stated above but then
    there might be a lot of strategic development involved to define target groups,
    what best will appeal to this group etc. etc. We normally work in this way and
    our latest Identity job is  around 100.000$ which only includes development up
    to approved logo. Implementation comes as a seperate project with it's own budget
    after that.\r\n\r\nCheck which hourly rate you should charge with Aiga. They would
    probably know the level in your neck of the woods.\r\n\r\nHope I cleared up some
    of your questions.?\r\nI hope I cleared up some questions"

  body: I think logos are some of the hardest most time consuming thing I do. Don't
    underestimate your time spent especially if it's a good mark that you can stand
    by. Don't forget the the value of a logo either. A good mark should last 5-10
    years? If they use it that long think about the price divided out over time. They'll
    probably want to plaster it everywhere too. So in my opinion it's the best bang
    you can get for your buck when paying for a design. A flyer may be used once or
    twice, but a logo will be used for a long time.

  body: "Pricing is a rather simple equation:\r\n\r\n(Annual Salary you want + All
    expenses) / # BILLABLE hours you can or want to work in a year = your hourly rate.\r\n\r\n(Your
    hourly rate * # hours it takes to make the logo) + expenses + 'added value markup'=
    what you charge the client.\r\n\r\nYou NEED to figure your hourly rate to even
    find a baseline to see if you are making an actual living at doing this. A lot
    of new designers completely fail to fully figure in their hourly rate. Design
    firms don't charge $100 an hour so they can get rich, but rather to eek out a
    living. ;0)\r\n\r\nBottom line is to be sure to figure out all the above to know
    what your absolutely bottom-line price can be. For me, it was in the $65/hr range...anything
    less than that wouldn't be worth my time. I then charge more than that to hit
    my 'worth my time' rate.\r\n\r\nAnd note that the $65 rate I figured has no bearing
    on what you should charge. We likely live in different parts of the globe with
    different economies and different clients and different personal preferences and
    different skill sets, etc. \r\n\r\nAnd one last tip...don't underestimate your
    expenses and don't overestimate your billable hours. Few freelancers are likely
    going to be billable more than 20-25 hours in a week. A (sane, IMHO...though there
    are plenty of insane ones) full time employee for a large design firm won't be
    billable more than 30-34 hours a week."

  body: "EC, I see you've already received plenty of good advice here... \r\n\r\nOne
    thing I would add is, besides naming your figure up front, never, ever, begin
    work on something before you've received 1/3 of your fee, especially when dealing
    with a new client you know nothing about... You have no idea how many horrible
    situations you will avoid by doing this... and it helps to weed out clients who
    don't really value design or your work, or who don't take a business transaction
    seriously. This shows them you mean business, and lets you start working without
    fear of getting completely burned. Also: have a kill fee figured out beforehand
    as well, in case a client cancels a job halfway through.\r\n\r\nCan I recommend
    a few books I own or have read?\r\n\r\n<em>Talent Is Not Enough</em>, by Shel
    Perkins\r\n\r\n<em>Starting Your Career as a Freelance Illustrator or Graphic
    Designer</em>, by Michael Fleishman\r\n\r\n<em>The Designers' Commonsense Business
    Book</em>, by Barbara Ganim\r\n\r\nThere are more \"business of design\" books
    recommended here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.graphicdesignforum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=28133\r\n\r\nGood

    pub, and you didn't have expenses or equipment to buy. I like to think that a
    freelance rate is about triple what a salary would be for the same person. So
    your \xA330 is more like \xA310."

  body: "Did the original person get their question answered?\r\n\r\nAside from all
    the numbers people are throwing out, I would say that if you are feeling uncomfortable
    about where things are going, just be honest. Ask if you can put the project on
    hold till you work out some kind of agreement on payment.\r\n\r\nYou can do things
    differently next time. But for now, if you keep giving it for free, they may be
    expecting it for free. You might \r\nbecome resentful. Or they may be planning
    to pay you but without you knowing, you may not approach the work with the best
    mental state.\r\n\r\nSay that you should have addressed a fee up front but didn't.
    You can admit that dealing with aquaintances is a bit awkward. But that now that
    the project has been going on for quite a bit, you'd like to establish some parameters.
    (It's better for everyone by the way).\r\n\r\nEstablish what the final deliverable
    is (logos in various formats, etc), how many rounds of revisions are included
    in the base fee, and of course the fee.\r\n\r\nIf they don't want to pay, at least
    you have your answer.\r\n\r\nI might disagree with the person who suggested you
    lose quite a bit early on. I would say that a lower hourly rate is what you get
    for being new. The client shouldn't pay as much for someone who doesn't have much
    experience troubleshooting, or with solving sophisticated problems, etc. But I
    think you should charge for your time spent (unless there is a specific learning
    curve like a software program or something). As you gain more experience, your
    hourly rate goes up.\r\n\r\nI know someone who said no good logo can be done in
    fewer than 40 hours. Not sure I would say that exactly. Depends on if you are
    doing a thorough company analysis, audience study, etc. But if you figure at least
    a time+materials rate and maybe add on a percentage (the value-added fee the person
    spoke of which covers the fact that they are using this over and over for years),
    that should do it.\r\n\r\nGood luck. "

  body: "great topic, I work for a London agency and am charged out at \xA380 an hour.
    \ My boss always top loads the quotes for a job as he reckons that after 12 years
    in the industry its the only way to make money from design, so for example there
    would be 4 days for a logo design then only 1 hour for its application to each
    piece of media, eg. business cards, compliment slips etc... \r\n\r\nThis way the
    client is less likely to back out in the later stages as they have already put
    the majority of the money in.  Also if they do get cold feet in the later stage,
    you do not loose out as much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally with my own brand identity
    freelance projects I charge out at 3 days work @ 9hours a day for a selection
    of logos which is stage 1. (5-7 different logos)\r\n\r\nStage 2: Shows the application
    of 2 of the logos throughout their literature in different colours and 1 revision.
    1 days work @ 9hours a day charged.\r\n\r\nIs this a good way to do it, am I loosing
    out?  I am only charging \xA315 an hour for my most recent job as its a sweet
    project and I am still an undergrad on placement."
