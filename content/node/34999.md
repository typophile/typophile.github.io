  body: "In case it helps your research, this type of serif is called \"Latin\"\r\n(although
    often this includes serifs that don't have totally sharp\r\nends, like Azuza*).
    BTW, a good example is Saracen: http://www.typography.com/catalog/saracen/index.html\r\n\r\n*
    See the description here:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/azuza/\r\n\r\nLatin
    serif fonts were big in France in\r\nthe second half of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
