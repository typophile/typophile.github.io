  software. I am in the process of redesigning their logo. I have attached a file
  that shows what their original logo was, and what I have done to redefine it. I
  need some help and/or feedback. The Santos group has several software projects,
  and they need one logo that will represent them all. The various individual projects
  include model-checking, software verification, and construction of high-confidence
  software systems...if that means anyone to the technical readers out there. I feel
  that I have improved on what they had before, but I think I can still go further.
  Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBen"

    reel to reel, computing. Good or bad, that's what I see. Beyond that I'm not sure
    what the S could mean or infer. The leaning \"o\" doesn't strike me at all. *Shrug*\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: Thanks for all of the positive feedback. No, the logo doesn't need the mark,
    but I felt it might be nice to create a symbol that would be easily recognized
    and associated with our group. The concept behind the mark is very abstract...much
    like the work we do at Santos. I chose the interlocking S for santos(not abstract),
    and broke it up to show how our model checker makes software complete (more abstract).
    I guess I need to really sit down and look at what we do here...which is difficult
    for me. I don't think like a computer scientist; i think like an artist. (insert
    sigh)p.s.- the icon is a B, for Ben. :)

  body: 'Ben, I might do a few things: Loose the tilt o. Loose the abstract mark if
    you are going to consumers (they won''t get it, and you don''t want a logo to
    be an inside joke). Loosen up the letterspacing and under the name use "software
    verification" as a division (smaller) and the same your other diciplines, and
    color code each division. Color coding is not pracitical for print but for your
    web site it makes sense. In print you could use tints of a color, but make sure
    they are 20% differences. That is what the eye can see as different.'

    The infinity symbol as a hybrid S for example.\r\n\r\nI agree with Dan that you
    don't want something that will only be understood by people at Santos, but I don't
    agree that you should throw out a mark entirely.\r\n\r\nShowing a building as
    part of a corporate identity was very popular in the 1950s (in the US anyway)
    but it has become retro-cool recently. (See <a href=\"http://www.house-ind.com\">House
    Industries</a>.)"

  body: "Here's an off-the-wall idea:  You could keep the mark (as it is, or more
    like an infinity sign) and break it with vertical lines to create a gradation.
    \ Well, it would seem like a good idea, if it didn't remind me of IBM.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you want to convey the idea of software becoming complete, it could work, though
    something else to give it direction would help that along.  Something like an
    arrow could emphasize that the software (or whatever) on one side is making a
    transition and becoming complete on the other, rather than just being broken.
    \ A simple triangle could do the same."

  body: 'Be careful with fine lines or gradients with a logo. Think of the end uses.
    If it will be used small or printed you will want a simple solution (Many typefaces
    have Inktraps that are designed to fill-in when printing). Develop you logo in
    black and white when it works at that basic level then explore color options. '

    suggested changes into the Santos logo redesign. Here is what I have come up with
    so far. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cis.ksu.edu/~dolezal/santos_redesign_update.gif\r\n\r\nI
    feel that this design is getting closer to what they need. The software projects
    are not commercial yet...in case that makes a difference. Our main audience is
    the U.S. Dept. of Defense and various University Computing and Information Science
    Departments around the world. It seems as though we have a very narrow audience.
    Any other comments? Thank you, in advance."

  body: "I like the concept of the mark but I feel it's missing some depth and has
    an awkward feel about the centre, you might do well to look at something like
    a <a href=\"http://www.mi.sanu.ac.yu/vismath/sequin/\">moebius strip</a> which
    because you can travel both sides of it without lifting you finger has something
    of the examination process about it (I'm getting carried away here). Your strap
    line is going to fight a losing battle against print technology at smallish sizes
    you might need to go to two or three lines or abandon the justification and let
    ir run the full width of the logo and print it in black.\r\nTim"

  body: "Or you could devide the infinite sign (like a stencil font) into the amount
    of divisions Santos has. It would suggest that all the separate blocks are part
    of the infinite cycle. They all are connected and you could even put them in the
    right order, if that is apropriate for the corporate communication. \r\nYou could
    colour the separate blocks and use these colours as identification for the divisions.
    Each division has his own colour and place in the cycle. Sweet...\r\n\r\nJust
    another idea.\r\n\r\n\xAE\r\n\r\n*** www.characters.nl  { Typography to express

  body: I lean towards version 2 but because of the audience you are trying to reach,
    its not formal enough. Going for government projects, don't look loose and informal,
    make the look buttoned up and as formal and stiff as you can. You might even look
    at all caps for your name. Just some thoughts.
