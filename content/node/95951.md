    biases against those that don't have access to that size. For most of the rest

    will have more of an impact than the font selection, and there may be a question
    of appropriateness of a given font to a given narrative.\r\n   3) Sampling bias:
    You're asking people to PRINT OUT this material? Only those willing and able to
    do so would therefore be counted; in other words, interested parties with time
    on their hands and a willingness to spend money on ink and paper.\r\n   4) Sample

  body: "Yes, but the readability of it depends on the relationship of the content
    of the text to the typeface, as well as the layout of the page. Does the text
    have a lot of capitals or numbers or italics or paragraph breaks? What is the
    subject matter? How wide is the column? What is the leading? And, since all the
    typefaces you've chosen are indeed serious, readable faces that could be used
    for substantial texts, the more important question becomes whether it's appropriate
    to the tone and content of whatever you're typesetting. What I'm trying to say
    is that I don't think tests of \"readability\" have much relevance or interest
    outside of a specific project. All these faces are readable enough that what is
    more likely to have an effect on the reader is their appropriateness \u2014 which
    depends on artistry and history, not science."

  body: "How many works of fiction have you ever read in your life that were set 13pt
    on letter size paper? If the point of this test is to look at sans serif types
    in the context of long texts of the kind normally set in serif types, surely the
    first thing to control are all the other aspects of typography normally associated
    with such texts. That means either a smaller format akin to a book or a two-column
    layout akin to a magazine, and it definitely means a smaller type size than you
    suggest.\r\n\r\nWhy voting on a shortlist? That isn't even remotely scientific.
    If you want to limit the number of types considered, you need to come up with
    reasons for the selection that are meaningful to the exercise, e.g. types with
    particular different characteristics.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the problem of the
    text itself influencing readability, this may be a real issue given your proposed
    text selection method. If using different texts, one wants to be able to ensure
    similar levels of syntactical complexity, vocabulary, etc., which is difficult
    unless one has a source for rated texts. Picking random 'entertaining public domain
    stories' won't provide good controls. Here's a better idea, I think: pick a single
    story of reasonable length and use a different font on each page. Produce a set
    of numbered PDFs with different fonts used on different pages, and ask participants
    to pick one at random (or assign them one at random) and record which they read.
    The idea here is that you avoid e.g. the same font always being used for the most
    exciting and riveting part of the story."

    look at them in 200 point or so, you notice they are very different.  Caspari
    is close to being mono-line, and all it's curve look pretty polished, whereas
    Kievit is not mono-line at all, and all it's lines and curves looks, well I can't
    come up with a better term than \"hand drawn.\"  Yet again, to me, at long text
    size, they feel remarkably similar to one another.\r\n\r\nThe Scala Sans sample
    I find the most interesting, however.  It has such an \"official,\" almost \"clinical\"
    appearance.  Might be a bit too \"formal\" looking for casual reading (long text
    reading for pleasure, as opposed to research, education, etc...), but there is
    something very pleasing and \"right looking\" about it for body text, for say,
    a new prescription drug brochure.\r\n\r\nLegato seems to take on very stoic, serious
    tones when set in long copy.  I would love to see a copy of the bible set in Legato.
