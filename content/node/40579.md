  body: "Mmm, lovely! Thanks for sharing Sharon. Very beautiful.\r\n\r\nAnother photographer
    I know makes flower-themed art prints using a direct positive exposure technique
    as follows: grab a large sheet of Agfachrome (formerly Cibachrome) color positive
    photographic paper, and lay flowers and such-like on top. Flattened flowers work
    better, and you can of course enhance their contact with the paper by laying a
    sheet of clear glass on top to press them closer against the surface. Expose the
    composition with a white light source---whatever temperature Agfachrome paper
    likes for white balance. Develop the \"print\" in the normal chemical process,
    and you end up with a one-off art print. The colors of the flowers and stems and
    leaves is transferred in the same way exposure to a transparency transfers colors
    via the direct positive process. Areas directly exposed to the white light come
    up white :^)\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    know the proper term, sorry).

    is called venation.  '
