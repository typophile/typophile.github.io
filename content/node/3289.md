body: Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a beginning graphic design student. My first assignment
  was to design/redesign a restaurant logo. I&#39;ve chosen a takeout bagel joint
  named &#34;David&#39;s Bagels &amp; Deli&#34; -- it&#39;s a mom-and-pop-type shop
  frequented by neighborhood locals. The interior is pretty nondescript and there&#39;s
  currently no logo. Existing signage and awning just states the name in a generic
  manner, like many New York City shop awnings. The place has a cozy, neighborhood
  feel, generated mostly by the customers and the friendly folks who work there. It&#39;s
  the kind of place where they&#39;ll know your name and your regular order after
  a couple of visits. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the logo I came up with. I would greatly
  appreciate any feedback I can get to improve upon this... Thanks very much in advance
  for your help. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Noah <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27146.gif"

    is a lot of work to do here, but first things first

  body: I think the Dom is working well &#40;except for the fake apostrophe&#41;,
    but if you want &#34;cozy&#34; that slab serif is way too brutal. For something
    heavy but fiendly, try Adobe&#39;s Motter Corpus, or Underware&#39;s Sauna. <BR>

  body: Peter - your setting of the word Bagel made me <BR>think of the Ben and Jerry&#39;s
    font. That <BR>slab serif has a hand-drawn, neighborhood <BR>feel. ... if that&#39;s
    the aesthetic you are going for, <BR>you might try sketching out some roughs <BR>as
    a starting point. Flourishes could add a <BR>homespun flavor. <BR> <BR>And like
    Scott said, a digital photo would be great.  <BR>I&#39;m picturing a rectangular
    awning but <BR>your layout suggests more squarish. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: The weight of your DOM doesn&#39;t match that of your BAGELS. Perhaps something
    more like <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/letterheadfonts/fattony.shtml"
    target="_blank">Fat Tony</a> or another bolder handlettered style. I&#39;ll agree
    with BJ about doing some sketching too. You might end up playing with other contrasts
    and use type more like Fink Gothic and Fink Heavy. &#40;Off the top of my head&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I can see what you, Hrant, mean about the Slab being rigid against the
    Dom, but I think that this will have a lot more to do with the treatment of the
    type, methods employed by signpainters like outlines or shadows. The idea of a
    handpainted sign is nice, and could be an interesting exploration in the idea
    of a hand-lettered sign.

  body: 'I agree with what others have said &#40;particularly talking to the owners/
    workers about the place&#41;. I think the most key thing to focus on here is not
    tweaking what you have &#40;in the first post&#41;, but thinking about things
    that feel unique and related to what you&#39;re dealing with: hand-drawn, printing
    irregularities, soft variations like dough or a on well-used kitchen tool. <BR>
    <BR>Your logotype is set in a fairly common typeface &#40;from what&#39;s available
    at school, right?&#41; and a pretty standard configuration. It definitely makes
    it look like a typical NYC awning, but it looks that way because it looks like
    it was set by the printing company that did the awning. Do research online and
    walking around NYC. Sketch lettering that&#39;s been around for a while, or looks
    really unique and warm. Maybe image-search on google for &#39;deli&#39; or &#39;bagels&#39;
    and see what strikes you. Just beware of the fake mom &#39;n&#39; pop look, like
    a big chain trying to look like it&#39;s a little shop.'

  body: 'I can&#39;t thank you folks enough for your feedback, it&#39;s been a great
    help. I had to present my work last night, and I&#39;ve included the final results
    of what I wound up with presenting &#40;#2 and #3 only. These came about after
    numerous discussions with my instructor&#41;. I unfortunately didn&#39;t have
    the time to interview the owners before turning this in, but since I have another
    week to turn in the final version I will definitely make time for this.  <BR>
    <BR>I was able to find one of the fonts suggested here but not the others &#40;I&#39;m
    limited to what the school computers offer&#41;. <BR> <BR>This is a picture of
    the shop itself. There is another sign in the shop that says &#34;David&#39;s
    Bagels &amp; Deli&#34;. Our instructor told us to only work with the complete
    name &#40;that being the most complete name of the place&#41; but in the end the
    &#34;&amp; Deli&#34; was so problematic that she suggested dropping it. In the
    end this seemed OK to do, as really the focus of the place is bagels. People really
    come here for bagels and it&#39;s their bread and butter.  <BR> <BR>Some of the
    crits I received for this is that the bagel needs to look more &#34;bagely&#34;.
    Folks suggested that I continue sketching bagels and trying to find unique qualities
    of them that I can translate into this bagel. My instructor seemed to prefer #3
    over #2. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27303.gif"

  body: Peter what street is that shop on I swear I&#39;ve seen it before.  <BR>Something
    to note about Mahattan walk-in eateries. Most of the Tex-Mex shops are run by
    Koreans and most of the Deli&#39;s are too. My local bagel shop is all latin americans,
    with english being the second language. Vision about their business isn&#39;t
    the driving goal, these deli&#39;s and tex-mex and bagel shops are part of an
    organization that pools the resources and distributes the wealth. One year a water
    main broke on 5th avenue and the korean deli was forced to shut down for 3 months
    but it never had to go out of business, because it was part of the organization.

    for your post. It&#39;s quite possible that the owners might not be interested
    in anything I have to say, but I&#39;ll find that out soon enough. <BR> <BR>But
    even if that turns out to be  the case, I&#39;d still like to finish this project
    &#40;actually I have to finish it for this class&#41; and I guess I&#39;ll just
    have to declare some assumptions about the owners&#39; &#34;vision&#34; for the
    sake of completing the classwork.'
