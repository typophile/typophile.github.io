    Elsner+Flake released this I gues...\r\n\r\n150watt.net"

    The original spacing can be seen on this page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-type-that-s-tight-but-not-touching\r\n\r\nNote
    how the letters line up between the two lines.\r\n\r\nWhile searching for this,
    I found some funny \"avant garde\" examples:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.avantgardeprivatehire.co.uk/Default.asp?Page=13\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chezamyl.com/index.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.avantgardeoutfitters.com/scripts/openExtra.asp?extra=1\r\n\r\n...from
    the pick-the-font-that's-the-same-as-the-name-of-the-business school of design.
    The last one is probably a trademark infringement, although it doesn't look like
    they are actually a going concern."
