  an typographic investigation about the influence of blackletters in heavy metal
  bands.\r\n I've found some information but I need something specific about how was
  that influence and why, there's a lot of heavy metal bands like Motorhead, AC/DC
  and more where they use blackletter on their album covers.\r\n\r\nThere's some examples.
  Thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/220px-Motorheadselftitled_4915.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/images_6479.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/goatwhore_6074.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/gorgoroth-017_5614.jpg]"

    that.\r\n\r\nwhere did you get the information about that? some bibliography?
    \r\n\r\nI've found some texts about the origins of heavy metal, but nothing about
    the heavy metal aesthetic. It would be interesting founding that information.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, like the example of CSNY, another band: The Allman Brothers used blackletters
    on their albums, with another connotation.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Allman-Brothers-Band-Back-Where-It-All-352980_3883.jpg]"

    + Wiki.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think the Allman Bros. logo was blackletter, more
    Retro Americana commercial signwriting.\r\nI don\u2019t know who did the lettering.\r\nIt
    \uFB01rst appeared on this (note the art deco): [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Enlightened_Rogues_4492.jpg]\r\nAt
    the time, there was an emerging interest in popular culture, and a nostalgia for
    its roots. \r\nTechnically, in its intricacy and skill, the style of old commercial
    art lettering represented a direction for free-form psychedelic lettering to take.
    \r\nBut that\u2019s a very different aesthetic to the undead goth thing, which
    was more about hard drugs and headbanging than spacing out on psychedelics."

    that album was on the first years of 70's but was released on 1979. I've already
    seen the art deco and lettering influence but I had doubts about the lowercases
    letters, they have gothic refferences.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for the info about Gerard

  body: "One of the first rock albums showing classic blackletters on its front and
    back covers was probably Jethro Tull's \"Aqualung\" (1971):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aqualung_6011.jpg]\r\n[The
    Fette Gotisch typeface (with a misplaced x instead on an r in Jethro) on the original
    vinyl release was replaced by Notre Dame in subsequent re-editions.]\r\n\r\nFor
    some reason, Ian Anderson decided to pack his \"bunch of songs\" inside an antique/medieval
    visual framework, an it was there that the blackletters played a role. Nothing
    to do with Jethro Tull being a \"Hard Rock\" or \"Heavy Metal\" band.\r\n\r\nIn
    1976, Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow (as noted in a previous post) and Judas Priest
    released \"Rising\" and \"Sad Wings of Destiny\":\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Raising-Sad_4297.png]\r\nThese
    were true \"Hard Rock\" albums, but it is my impression that the choice of blackletters
    for the visual framework had to do with the epic/magical/medieval aspects of the
    music and the lyrics, rather than with the kind of music itself. In fact, Rainbow
    changed their logo a few years later for the release of \"Down to Earth\" (1979),
    and Judas Priest sticked to classic blackletters for just one more release (\"Sin
    After Sin\", 1977). In both cases, although the music remained great Hard Rock,
    the epic/magical/medieval themes were, for the most part, gone.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    after departing from Rainbow, shortly after their last \"blackletter logo\" release
    (\"Long Live Rock 'n' Roll\", 1978), Ronnie James Dio's solo career was accompanied
    from the beginning to the end with classic blackletters:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dio_4504.png]\r\nDio
    always sticked to epic/magical/medieval/fantastic themes for his masterful Hard
    Rock,  an this is why, in my opinion, classic blackletters were always present
    in his releases as well as in his live shows.\r\n\r\nThese are just a few examples
    (many others could be found outside the Hard Rock realm) showing that classic
    blackletters in music, as well as in many other arts, have to do mainly with the
    subject being contained in it, and not so much with how this subject is expressed.\r\n\r\nThe
    modern trends concerning Black/Doom/Death/Gothic/... Metal, are just another story
    ...\r\n"

    the album covers, to see when and where the trope emerged.\r\nThe seminal bands
    did not use blackletter until the early \u201970s.\r\nThe style was generally
    more glam than goth at \uFB01rst.\r\nA lot of the gothic subsequently came from
    the punk ethos, eg the Damned (Dave Vanian).\r\nM\xF6torhead\u2019s look came
    more out of the British rocker tradition.\r\nHawkwind (psychedelic rock?)\u2014from
    which Lemmy was \uFB01red\u2014was an early adopter of blackletter.\r\n\r\nThis
    from 1972 has a strong Art Deco influence (popular retro at the time), but there\u2019s
    a bit of darkness and the lettering leaning towards blackletter:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/220px-Doremi_Fasol_Latido_-_Hawkwind_6028.jpg]\r\n\r\nCSNY
    had blackletter on their 1970 <em>D\xE9j\xE0 vu</em> album, but the connotation
    was quite different from gothic.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CSNY_5243.png]\r\n\r\nhere\u2019s
    an early one, Rainbow\u2019s Rising, 1976\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unknown_4747.jpeg]\r\n\r\nEarliest?

    Geezer Butler was the guy interested in black magic, a fan of Dennis Wheatley.\r\nAs
    a young teen in the 1960s I too had read Wheatley, for the frisson of the occult.\r\nBut
    the associated graphic imagery never used blackletter, not on book covers, not
    on movie posters.\r\nAnd the same was true for Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. Even
    Nosferatu.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Wheatley_4248.jpg]\r\n\r\n<em>Sabbath
    Bloody Sabbath</em> connects the dots, with the runic, occult, Nazi \u201CSS\u201D
    (later part of the Kiss wordmark).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/220px-Black_Sabbath_SbS_5427.jpg]\r\nNazi
    symbolism was taken up by rock musicians of various stripes in the 1970s, for
    its shock and transgression value. I would argue that blackletter came to metal
    for its Nazi connotations, although its medi\xE6val quality is not out of keeping
    with other aspects of the genre.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This subject has come up before, though I can't locate the thread. Heavy-metal
    music burst on the scene in the US and UK in the 1960s and 70s, and the musicians
    and their fans were mostly children of the generation that fought in WWII.\r\nBlackletter
    resembles Fraktur, which is commonly associated with the Third Reich (even though
    they officially banned its use in 1941). As Nick points out, it was the perfect
    branding for music that was meant to piss off your dad--the letterforms of the
    enemy he fought against in the War.\r\nThat's not why they used blackletter on
    \"Aqualung.\" Side 2 of \"Aqualung\" is subtitled \"My God\" and consists of five
    songs that mock the hypocrisy of the institutional church, and I suspect that
    they used blackletter to evoke the look of Bibles and other church documents."
