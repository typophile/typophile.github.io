  body: There are actually three typefaces; "for" is in a different face. Maybe it's
    just a different weight though; I can't tell.

  body: Univers extended.... Yes, I think you're right. Thanks. The serif? Something
    Bodoni related, right?

  body: And you're right... It appears certain that the 'for' is something else.

  body: That 'for' is close to Minion. But that ain't it. I'm assuming it's System
    font related like Arial. But that's just an assumption.
