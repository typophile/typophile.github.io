  help me figure out what font this is, that would be great. It really looks like
  Futura, but the M's verticals aren't slanted. This comic book was done by Chip Kidd
  - is there a certain typeface he uses?\r\n\r\nHere is a link to other covers so
  you can see it a bit larger: http://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=581861"
