body: "I am happy to introduce a highly versatile multi width type family called Tanger
  Serif by Jarno Lukkarila Type Foundry. After three years of preparation it feels
  great to make it public!\r\n \r\nTanger Serif is inspired by fine Transitionals
  and hard working news paper fonts from the 19th century. It shares their strong
  and straightforward appearance in refreshed and up-to-date form. Tanger Serif comes
  in three widths each containing five weights in both roman and italic. \r\n\r\nFonts
  include many Open Type features (including small caps and old style figures) which
  allow close typographic detailing. Wide character sets guarantee extensive language
  support.\r\n \r\nFind more about Tanger Serif at our website\r\nwww.jarnolukkarila.com\r\n
  \r\nIf you\u2019d like to receive a pdf specimen, please mail us to support@jarnolukkarila.com\r\n\r\nBest
  Regards,\r\nJarno Lukkarila\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JLTF_Tanger_Serif_preview_6377.jpg]"
