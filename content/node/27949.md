  it has only uppercase letters . \r\nWhen I design the space in fontlab-4   I picked
  up  800 for x-height   ascender=100   descender= -100  which is  1000 UPM.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem I am facing now is when I generate the font and test it  I can not see the
  ascender and descender . It is clipped \r\n. \r\nCan someone shade a light on this
  ? \r\nAll the help is appreciated . \r\n\r\nBy the way I am planning to produce
  TT . \r\nThank you !  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipoli_6260.gif]"

    have you set your OS/2 table Win vertical metrics? These will determine the clipping
    zones.\r\n\r\nSee this wiki entry on how to set vertical metrics:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/wiki/Vertical%20Metrics%20How-To"

    above the x-height. So x-height=800 with ascender=100 doesn't make much sense.

      desender is = -100 \r\n   900+(-100)= 1000 UPM.\r\n After I put this values

      it \r\nI get Os/2= Typo Ascender=900 Typo Descender= -100 ,Typo line Gap=0 WinAscent
      =0 WinDscent=0  \r\n  \r\nFor  hhea I get Ascender =0 Descender =0 Linegap=0
      \r\nI guess my question is what is the right way to put this values in .\r\nThank
