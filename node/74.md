    &#34;bump&#34; into each other today. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Tom, I can teach you a trick
    in Photoshop to  <BR>simulate the &#34;stamped&#34; effect. <BR> <BR>BTW Tom,
    with a Username like that, I suppose  <BR>you&#39;re auditioning for a position
    as my sidekick,  <BR>I presume? <BR><b>Troubleman</b> and <b>Dangerboy</b>, the
    boy wonder! =D

  body: Thanks Yves, but you deserve some credit too, hence we&#39;ve got clearly
    cross-posted here. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Btw, I know it&#39;s been a long time, but
    I&#39;d like to comment about Troubleman&#39;s &#34;Coming from the Summer&#34;.
    Sorry for the delay. <BR>I&#39;ve been listening to it a few times, and I think
    it&#39;s really great. And well-produced too. Somehow it reminds of Pixies, but
    I don&#39;t know exactly why. Maybe that&#39;s just me. ;-&#41; Anyway, are you
    going to release it through some independent label there? And are there any good
    bands from Belgium these days? I remember reading about a band named &#34;Ks Choice&#34;,
    iirc, from Belgium, but I don&#39;t know much about it.

    to release it because after two  <BR>years of recording and producing the CD,
    we&#39;re  <BR>completely broke. Let&#39;s just keep our fingers  <BR>crossed
    and hope somebody in the music industry  <BR>decides to invest some in this band.
    <BR> <BR>The Pixies reference is not too far off: we  <BR>started as a very solid
    rock, even punkish band,  <BR>but nowadays we&#39;ve diversified our repertoire.
    <BR> <BR>There are certainly a number of good bands in  <BR>Belgium, and some
    of them even enjoy international  <BR>acclaim: K&#39;s Choice, Hooverphonic, Buscemi,
    dEUS,  <BR>Dead Man Ray etc...'

    for the tips on Belgian bands. I&#39;ve read good things  <BR>about Hooverphonic
    and dEUS, but I didn&#39;t know they are from  <BR>yer lands. I&#39;ll definitively
    check them out. <BR> <BR>Heinrich, I tell ya samba and Brazilian music in general
    has great  <BR>stuff. But, these days, I think the best Brazilian music is being  <BR>done
    by non-Brazilians. I tell ya this because I live here in Brazil  <BR>and I feel
    that way. There&#39;s too much nostalgia around here. <BR>

  body: 'Hello there Tom, <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the Adobe Photoshop mini-tutorial for
    distressing type in order to  <BR>achieve a &#34;stamped&#34; look. This little
    trick I developped almost a decade  <BR>ago, so I hope I remember it all correctly.
    <BR> <BR>Create whatever type composition you need in Illustrator or directly
    in  <BR>Photoshop. Just remember to keep the resolution fairly low, because  <BR>we&#39;re
    going to need pixel texture halfway through. I created this example  <BR>in Illustrator
    using House Gothic 23 ThreeD Fill at 72pt/64pt on a  <BR>360x180pt canvas and
    opened it in Photoshop as a grayscale image at  <BR>72 ppi. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10621.jpg"
    alt="Step_1"> <BR> <BR>Select the black type areas with the magic wand or using
    an alpha  <BR>channel based on your piece <i>&#40;Duplicate channel...: Black:
    invert -&#62;  <BR>Select...: Load selection: Black copy: new selection&#41;</i>
    This prevents you  <BR>from mucking up the white background. <BR> <BR>Apply a
    High Pass to &#34;eat away&#34; the insides of the characters <i>&#40;Filter:  <BR>Other:
    High Pass...&#41;</i> Play a bit with the slider: for the example I set the  <BR>Radius
    to 10 pixels and applied it twice. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10622.jpg"
    alt="Step_2"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10623.jpg"
    alt="Step_3"> <BR> <BR>Apply a fair amount of Gaussian noise to achieve the &#34;grainy&#34;
    texture.  <BR><i>&#40;Filter: Noise: Add Noise...: Gaussian&#41;</i> For the example
    the slider was  <BR>set to an amount of 50. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10624.jpg"
    alt="Step_4"> <BR> <BR>Deselect <BR> <BR>Increase to desired resolution by resampling.
    <i>&#40;Image: Image size...:  <BR>resample image&#41;</i> I trippled the resolution
    from 72ppi to 216ppi. <BR> <BR>Diffuse the image to mask remaining bitmapping
    of the character shapes  <BR><i>&#40;Filter: Stylize: Diffuse...&#41;</i> and
    apply a Gaussian blur of 1 pixel to remove  <BR>the tiny pixels created by the
    Diffuse filter. <i>&#40;Filter: Blur: Gaussian  <BR>Blur...&#41;</i> <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10625.jpg" alt="Step_5"> <BR>
    <BR>Increase the brightness and contrast until you reach the desired amount  <BR>of
    &#34;inking&#34;. <i>&#40;Image: Adjust...: Brightness/Contrast&#41;</i> I set
    both sliders to  <BR>&#43;50. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10626.jpg"
    alt="Step_6"> <BR> <BR>Treshold the image to prepare for conversion to a bitmap
    image. Here  <BR>you can also play bit with the slider until you reach the desired
    amount  <BR>of &#34;inking&#34;. <i>&#40;Image: Adjust...: Treshold&#41;</i> I
    set the slider halfway. &#40;128&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10627.jpg"
    alt="Step_7"> <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s what it looks like from up close: the effect
    is perfectly random. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10628.gif"
    alt="Step_8"> <BR> <BR>Convert to a bitmap image &#40;Image: Mode: Bitmap...:
    50% treshold&#41;,  <BR>save as TIFF and import in your lay-out software of choice
