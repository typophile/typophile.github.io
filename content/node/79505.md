body: "Although this is, in part, a type ID question, I have posted it in general
  discussions because I would like to know more about this bizarre face than simply
  a name. On any PDFs downloaded from the JSTOR database, the name and copyright info
  appear in a distinctive and very amateur-looking typeface. Adobe Reader identifies
  it as CODE-2000 (TrueType). It is an unusually inconsistent font in many ways, as
  the attached pictures show. I am sure every typophile out there can pick out the
  idiosyncrasies for him- or herself. Does anyone know who deigned this face, or what
  its history entails?\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "Since I use JSTOR regularly, I was curious.  I only know what Google knows,
    but here's some information from [[http://www.unifont.org/fontguide/|www.unifont.org/fontguide/]]:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Code
    2000 is an experimental shareware font with over 34,000 glyphs designed by James
    Kass to cover all of the non-Han sections of the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane
    (BMP)... The shareware fee for continued use of this font after evaluation is
    $US 5.00.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe links to the home page for Mr. Kass and for
    the font seem to be defunct.\r\n\r\nAnother link:  [[http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts.html#code2000|http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts.html#code2000]].\r\n\r\nst"
