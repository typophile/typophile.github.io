    their a font that already has the handtooling or is that a custom job? The curviture
    on the \"D\" is difficult to creat manually."

    am not certain what tools you are trying to use to create these curves manually.
    If you can use Fontshop it's easy. Use the parallel line tool to make something
    that looks like this [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinside_5713.jpg]\r\nMerge
    the contours. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideMergedContours_4487.jpg]
    Delete everything except the segment that will form one side of your inline curve.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideDeleteAll
    ButContour_5924.jpg] Break this contour at the short side and convert to lines.
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideBreakContour_6740.jpg]\r\nDo
    the same thing to make the other side.\r\nJoin the two segments so as to make
    the correct length.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideJoinSegments_4138.jpg]
    Merge contours and delete all but the final inline portion. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideFinalInline_4306.jpg]

  body: "Hi Donshottype,\r\nThank You for sharing thia graphic!\r\n\r\nI went to FontShop.com
    and it looks like they offer fonts for sale but I didn't see a font creating software
    link.\r\n\r\nI'm grateful that you and DPape got me the info I needed to move
    forward. I was hoping I wasn't going to have to manually create the font but it
    seems I am going to have to. I wish there was a way I could add the fonts to photohop
    so I only have to do the work once and I could use the fonts over and over.\r\n\r\nI
    don't have font creation software :-(\r\n\r\nThank You again for your brain power!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The process described by Don can also be done in Adobe Illustrator (or Corel
    Draw if you wish).\r\nFor Illustrator: Convert the letter to curves, make a copy
    of /D's external outline and instead of the \"parallel line tool\" you can use
    Object=>Path=>Offset Path and specify a negative value.\r\nThe rest of process
    is similar.\r\n\r\nYou can't create a new font with Illustrator off-course, but
    you have the advantage to process each letter once and then use it on whatever
    image resolution you want without loosing any details."
