  selection, particularly for the logo, of a new B2B magazine geared toward architects,
  designers and retailers. The subject matter is the eco-conscious, environmentally
  conscious aspects of flooring. I would think the font should be very clean, maybe
  airy, something that suggests \"green.\" I appreciate any and all suggestions for
  headline fonts, body copy, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve"

  body: A font that suggests green. All that the movement conveys. There is a magazine
    out there called GreenSource that uses a very clean, thin font for their logo.
    They executed the concept exceptionally well. I am hoping to apply the concept
    to our magazine, but in a different direction than GreenSource.

    you considered hiring a graphic designer for this project? Seems like the kind
    of thing suited to a design professional.\r\n"

  body: Yes. I've been working with a freelance graphic designer, but to this point
    he hasn't really nailed it. That's why I figured maybe I could help him out with
    some suggestions.

  body: "I just finished one for  sustainability publication for my local government.
    I used  Priva Pro, and have to say  it worked out really well. The four weights
    (plus italics) really offered up a lot of flexibility throughout the various documents.,
    whether it was for a headline or text paragraph.\r\n\r\nI originally thought it
    would be too rigid and cold, but after using it on both a 4c executive summary
    and a down & dirty  200+ page b/w document (over 100 pages of tables, sweet!)
    I found the end result to be quite refreshing. I was initially concerned at using
    a sans-serif on pages set pretty solid as they have a tendency to overwhelm the
    eyes,  but it actually displayed some good humanist characteristics even at the
    smaller text sizes."

  body: Priva Pro may work because of its versatility. My initial mindset was an open
    font whose family included a thin weight. I thought maybe something along the
    lines of a Futura Light for the logo. Any thoughts? Anything else that may work?

    colored in green, can reveal a whiff of \"greenness\" or \"ecofriendliness\".
