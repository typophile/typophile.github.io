body: Is anyone able to identify what typeface the Sanforized wordmark is based off
  of? Futura Condensed Italic has some similarities in feel but it's not quite there.
  The _S_ and _O_ seem somewhat unique. Given the era where Sanforization was popular
  it's possible there are no digital equivalents. Thoughts?
