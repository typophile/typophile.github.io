body: "I'm doing some design that is meant to feel contemporary for somewhere around
  1850-1870 in the UK, particularly London. I'm a bit of a type noob, and I was looking
  for some general advice.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'm not entirely sure where to find
  good examples, though I've looked at the Wikipedia pages for the following typefaces.
  I've listed the reason I'm cautious about using them beside their names:\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt>Baskerville</dt>
  <dd>Much too early, and apparently fell out of favour until the 1917 revival.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Garamond</dt>
  <dd>Created at the end of the 18th century (edit: more like the mid-16th...) - would
  it have fallen out of fashion in the intervening period? </dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Bodoni</dt>
  <dd>Again, could be too early, and not very British.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Didot</dt>
  <dd>A bit more appropriate date-wise, but would it have made the transition to the
  UK?</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Scotch Roman</dt> <dd>Right time period, but according to Wikipedia
  it was \"popular in the early nineteenth century, particularly in the United States
  and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom.\" So a possibility, but probably not
  the foremost choice.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Caslon</dt> <dd>While it was created much too
  early, according to Wikipedia it \"saw a revival between 1840\u201380 as a part
  of the British Arts and Crafts movement.\" Furthermore, it suggests that \"for many
  years a common rule of thumb of printers and typesetters was When in doubt, use
  Caslon.\" This makes me think it's probably the best pick.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n\r\nFor
  what it's worth, this is almost certainly going to end up as a series of screen-exclusive
  work. I'm looking for both display and body type. Any print that comes about will
  be a secondary product. And obviously, I might go make an aesthetic choice to go
  with something historically inaccurate.\r\n\r\nHas anyone got any thoughts they'd
  care to share? Any further opinions or suggestions would be welcomed. Many thanks
  for reading!"

  body: "The best approach would be to find some examples from the era and then try
    to find current day typefaces that match or are similar. It sounds like you're
    asking about text faces, but it would be good to clarify that.\r\n\r\nAs far as
    Caslon goes, the Caslon we know of today is more like the original Caslon (late
    18th century). But descendants of Caslon types were pretty popular in the late
    19th century, usually called \"old style\" at the time. Examples of the genre
    are <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bruce-old-style/\">Bruce
    Old Style</a>, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/old-style-7/\">Old
    Style No. 7</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=215888\">Monotype
    Old Style</a>.\r\n\r\n\"Modern\" faces, along the lines of Nick Shinn's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\">Scotch
    Modern</a>, were also popular in the late 19th century."

    back then."

  body: "Thanks for the reply Mark. That information about Caslon is very useful.
    I definitely like both Bruce Old Style and Monotype Old Style. Also, Scotch Modern's
    lovely!\r\n\r\nI'm looking for both text and title faces, I suppose. In reality,
    I'm more likely to use something authentic for titles/headings and something that
    feels right, but is practical and legible for the text."

  body: For headings and boldface, you might want to look at "antiques" or "egyptians"
    (slab serifs) and "grotesques" (early British sans serifs).

    extremely excited review of your typefaces, along with your [[http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/Punch_Cuts.pdf|fascinating
    essay]] has swayed me. Hopefully a couple of faces will fit within my budget.
    By the way, the Figgins stuff is amazing. I had no idea so many beautiful type
    specimens were available online. Thank you!
