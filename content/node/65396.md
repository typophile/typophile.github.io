body: "Hemingway designed by Alessandro Segalini was inspired by the prize winning
  novel <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em> by Ernest Miller Hemingway.\r\n\r\nSegalini
  designed his typeface to carry the meaning of sharpness and harshness, and at the
  same time to show a stiff and a soft quality \u2013 the same qualities in which
  the nature of the sea is revealed in Hemingway\u2019s novel, a book that indeed
  speaks about the fairness of nature.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/hemingway/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hemingway_family_5539.png]"
