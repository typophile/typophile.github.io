  using the notes as inspiration for a new typeface I'm designing, and I can't seem
  to find a set of characters in .eps format.\r\n\r\nCan anyone point me in the right
  direction?"

    paticular (http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-2357802-note-vector.html) seemed it
    might be what I was looking for. \r\n\r\nHowever, Shutterstock is subscription
    only, so I'm not able to purchase the single file without paying for a months
    worth of downloads. :/\r\n\r\nI'm also wondering how much music note faces deviate
    from each other, finding the most orthodox would be ideal."

  body: "Slightly off topic, but I wonder when music font designers are going to actually
    start using the encodings provided in Unicode.  I haven't used Finale of Sebelius
    in a while, but their fonts (like Sonata) seemed to replace the notes in the spots
    designated for Basic Latin.  Maybe it's changed now, but I honestly doubt it.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    are composited from a number different component glyphs, but free might be good."
