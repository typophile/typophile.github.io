  to the original graphics files.  I have spent a good deal of time looking for what
  this typeface might be - but no luck.  It seems to have a strange g, but that might
  be poor web optimizing as well.\r\n\r\n(here is a link to the site in question -
  the face is used for all the top five main navigation rollovers.)\r\n\r\nhttp://kats.tec.ks.us/index.html\r\n\r\nthanks
  for your help!\r\n\r\nshawn"

    target="new">Futura</a> to me, with the bottom of the g sliced off or scrunched
    up.
