body: I&#39;m working on this logo for a project that I&#39;m doing. I like the way
  it&#39;s looking, but there&#39;s definately something missing. I think it&#39;s
  good, it just needs something, and I don&#39;t have any idea what that something
  is. Any input would be excellent thanks!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/18407.gif"

  body: Brandon, very curious to hear what this is about... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure
    that the question marks will make sense <BR>once you tell us what a jackass for
    jesus is. <BR> <BR>the thing that stands out immediately is the weight <BR>of
    the first letter of each word. Those letters are <BR>a tad bit dark. <BR> <BR>the
    f in &#39;for&#39; seems a little tall, too. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: I imagine you redrew the f to resemble a cross - it looks a bit uncomfortable
    - the weight is too much, as for the question marks if you rotate them and move
    the stop they will look more like j, once you have, try redrawing them to work
    with the weight of the other letters. However it strikes me that you are overpowering
    the copy.

  body: it&#39;s a website i&#39;m currently working on, essentially a different take
    on christianity. it&#39;s a reference when God in the old testament uses a donkey
    &#40;jackass&#41; to speak. So a jackass for jesus would be someone who doesn&#39;t
    have it all together, yet God chooses to use them anyway... <BR> <BR> <BR>i actually
    didn&#39;t change the &#39;f&#39; to look like a cross, just wanted it to line
    up with the bottom of the j&#39;s.  <BR> <BR>tim, i&#39;m curious what exactly
    you mean about rotating the question mark to make it look better. I guess i don&#39;t
    really see it. <BR> <BR>i&#39;m going to see if i can thin out the j&#39;s and
    i&#39;ll post my changes hopefully later on tonite. Thanks for the input!

  body: Get rid of the &#39;f&#39;. &#39;for&#39; shouldn&#39;t be the focus. <BR>
    <BR>Don&#39;t use the one-letter-for-two-words thing either &#40;second set&#41;.
    It rarely, if ever, actually works. I read that as &#39;ackass for esus&#39; <BR>
    <BR>While the donkey is cute, it&#39;s a bit too much. You have something clever
    going with the question marks, but throwing it inside an actual picture of a donkey
    is just way too literal and ruins &#39;aha!-ness&#39; of it.

  body: To be honest, I was initially offended that a Christian would have the lack
    of reverence for Jesus&#39; name to use it alongside jackass. Personally, I still
    wouldn&#39;t do it, but after reading your explanation for the application I have
    softended my opinion

  body: In all fairness, I&#39;m sure, once in a while, Jesus had a bit too much wine
    and made a jackass of himself in front of his buddies. We&#39;ve all been there,
    right? ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Fortunately, the Bible, I&#39;m sure, had a pretty thorough
    and detailed editing policy so we probably weren&#39;t privy to these moments
    as much as we would be if J.C. had been born in oh...say Southern CA circa 2003.

    that God seems to &#42;prefer&#42; using people who don&#39;t fit the bill because
    it clearly reveals Him as the enabler. <BR> <BR>Randy'

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m guessing Jesus was a regular guy with a famous Dad. That&#39;s
    just my opinion. I love religious discussions, but we probably stay somewhat on

  body: 'Scott, Jews read the Tanach, or Torah Shebiksav, which is <i>not</i> limited
    to the five books of Moses: the latter is a common misconception among gentiles.
    The term Torah by itself refers to the five books, but the Torah Shebiksav also
    contains the Nevi&#39;im &#40;Prophets&#41; and Kesuvim &#40;Writings&#41;. Altogether
    they form the Palestine Canon of 24 books; note that this is a different canon
    from that which was read in Christ&#39;s time: in Christ&#39;s time Jews read
    the Septuagint, which is a Greek translation of the Torah Shebiksav. <i>After</i>
    Christ&#39;s time, the Jews returned to the Hebrew text, but decided to leave
    out those books which had traditionally been part of the canon of scripture but
    for which they were unable to locate <i>complete</i> Hebrew manuscripts. These
    seven books are retained in Catholic and Orthodox Bibles, but were removed by
    the Protestants in what you would refer to as &#39;content management&#39;, and
    are referred to by Protestants as the Apocryphal books. Catholics call them the
    Deuterocanonical books. <BR> <BR>Jews, Catholics and Orthodox Christians all maintain
    a strong tradition of <i>non sola scriptura</i>; that is, unlike Protestants,
    they do not rely solely on scripture as a source of truth, but also on tradition
    and teaching authority. In Judaism, this tradition is traced to Moses and is called
    the Torah Sheb'
