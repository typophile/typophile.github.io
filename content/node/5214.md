  body: Your navigation text is miniscule and hard to read, but overall, the site
    is nice. I especially like your a-z listing where I can easily scan the faces
    on one page.

  body: It&#39;s a vast improvement, Jim. <BR>Not that the old one was terrible, but
    this is a much richer experience, and the structure is very direct and &#34;intuitive&#34;.
    <BR>Props for the designers section! <BR>I hope you sell gazillions of fonts.
    <BR> <BR>However, I agree with Darrel about the nav text. It might not be the
    size, just that the text seems cramped. Maybe an alternate face that has more
    variety of character width, or more letterspacing/tracking.

  body: Only complaint I might add is that on the main page you cannot click on two
    of the three highlighted typefaces - origen and softsoul - you can only add them
    to the basket.  I know its easy to just click on fonts and find em, but hey some
    of us have A.D.D.! <BR>the site &#60;strong&#62;looks great&#60;/strong&#62;!

  body: I agree, great improvements for the reasons already mentioned above. It&#39;s
    more open and accessible. <BR> <BR>Also, even though I can read it, that navigation
    type is pretty microscopic. If you like the size, perhaps a rollover in the banner
    up top that show the selected title at a larger type size would cover you?

  body: Hi Guys <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback. It is useful, many of the changes
    I made came about as a result of Nick&#39;s suggestions about 9 months ago. <BR>
    <BR>The menu text is easily changed, and I&#39;ll also put links from Origen and
    Softsoul through to the relevant type samples. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>JIM <BR>===

  body: 'Hi Jim, <BR> <BR>In the top 10 sometimes when you click on the font name
    directly it takes you to the wrong page &#40;clicking Digna leads to Nova etc&#41;
    The zoom icon seems to work better. <BR> <BR>In addition to the small nav text,
    I&#39;d increase the text size in the sidebar one level. Adding a touch of leading
    will lighten it up again. <BR> <BR>Generally, I&#39;d suggest giving more information
    about your fonts. The following should be available from the individual font&#39;s
    page IMHO:  <BR> <BR>Poster showing &#40;I like it!&#41; <BR>All the weights in
    the family stated explicitly <BR>&#40;Does it have small caps? Italic? DemiBold
    Condensed Expert Alternates?&#41;. <BR>Maybe a character map. <BR>PDF Specimen!
    <BR>Information about the design <BR>Info about the designer. I see their name,
    and I see a designers section... link em up! <BR>Did I mention PDF Specimen? <BR>
    <BR>All of the above will help me to trust the quality of your fonts, and let
    me confirm it on my own. <BR> <BR>Cheers! <BR>Randy'
