  and http://typophile.com/node/4493), but it seems like the answer i'm looking for
  is hidden in attachments and links that i'm not able to access.\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  for 3 fonts used in the end credits of Kill Bill volume 2.\r\n\r\nMy top priority
  is the one used at the very end for cast and crew credits.\r\n<a href=\"http://s212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/?action=view&amp;current=credits1.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/credits1.jpg\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://s212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/?action=view&amp;current=credits2.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/credits2.jpg\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>\r\n\r\nThe second would be the one used for
  main characters credits.\r\n<a href=\"http://s212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/?action=view&amp;current=credits3.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/credits3.jpg\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://s212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/?action=view&amp;current=credits4.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/credits4.jpg\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>\r\n\r\nThen the Kill Bill logo as it appears
  here.\r\n<a href=\"http://s212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/?action=view&amp;current=credits5.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc269/dionisiadionisia/credits5.jpg\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>\r\n\r\nAll the fonts can be seen \"in action\"
  here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teJwLb1Bh4k\r\nand\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhTAe-BjuXA\r\n\r\nThanks
  everyone in advance for your help!\r\nMarco"

  body: "I wondered about the first one when I saw the movie. I don't think I've ever
    seen it before. It's not very well done. It might be a free font made by an amateur.
    I wouldn't be surprised if it was designed by Tarantino himself, or maybe at his
    direction...\r\n\r\nTarantino, standing behind a guy with a font open in Fontographer:
    \"The A isn't doing it for me. It looks good. I'm not saying it doesn't look good.
    It's just not doing it for me. Can you do something at the top here? I've seen
    fonts where they have this extra thing at the top of the A. What do you call it...
    Like a serif, but not a serif... Yeah! I see what you're doing. It's like the
    thick part keeps on going, right past the top. Don't stop there. Keep going. Ohmygod!--it
    looks like a f*ckin' katana! This is great! This is perfect! Okay. I was thinking
    about the N...\""
