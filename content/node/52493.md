  body: "I assume this is going to be a free typeface, since you are giving it away
    for critique. (It's more typical to post a PDF specimen of the font.)\r\n\r\nOverall,
    it's pretty nice, but the color is somewhat variable. Keep in mind that slanted
    lines behave differently optically from horizontals and verticals.\r\n\r\nThe
    first character that struck me as odd was the @ sign. Also, there are inconsistencies
    that don't make sense. Your superior 2 looks OK, but the 2 in your two quarters
    sign looks cramped. I would expect those to match. I would keep the f on the baseline.
    The \xE6 has a slant that isn't anticipated by the a or the e, and so looks a
    bit odd. \r\n\r\n"

    maybe a pdf would be easier to make some critics I will do one."
