body: "Hello,\r\nWondering if any of your can recommend a hand lettering genius to
  help us create a signature logotype.  Was trying to work with Ale Paul from Sudtipos
  in Argentina, but he's about to go on vacation.  That's the kind of person I am
  looking for (i.e. in terms of the kinds of lettering he does).\r\n\r\nAny recommendations
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe are in San Francisco, but they/you/whoever
  doesn't have to be local.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\n"
