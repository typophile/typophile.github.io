body: "I'm working on a family with Text and Display optical sizes and trying to decide
  on the best way to handle the family naming. I've been debating between three scenarios,
  which I've attempted to illustrate below. Does anyone have any thoughts, preferences,
  or general feedback? I'm leaning strongly toward Option 1, but I wanted to see what
  other people thought. \r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\nOption 1 : Separate families for each size
  \r\n\r\nFont Family Text\r\n\u2022 Light \r\n\u2022 Light Italic \r\n\u2022 Regular
  \r\n\u2022 Regular Italic \r\n\u2022 Semibold  \r\n\u2022 Semibold Italic \r\n\u2022
  Bold \r\n\u2022 Bold Italic \r\n\r\nFont Family Display \r\n\u2022 Light \r\n\u2022
  Light Italic \r\n\u2022 Regular \r\n\u2022 Regular Italic \r\n\u2022 Semibold  \r\n\u2022
  Semibold Italic \r\n\u2022 Bold \r\n\u2022 Bold Italic \r\n\r\nThis is fairly common,
  probably even the standard way to do it. Everything is nicely organized and easy
  to manage. The downside is that switching between families is a two step process
  (change family, select style) and can get annoying. \r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\nOPTION 2 -
  One family with styles ordered: Weight -Size-Italic \r\n\r\nFont Family \r\n\u2022
  Light Text \r\n\u2022 Light Text Italic \r\n\u2022 Light Display \r\n\u2022 Light
  Display Italic \r\n\u2022 Regular Text \r\n\u2022 Regular Text Italic \r\n\u2022
  Regular Display \r\n\u2022 Regular Display Italic \r\n\u2022 Semibold Text \r\n\u2022
  Semibold Text Italic \r\n\u2022 Semibold Display \r\n\u2022 Semibold Display Italic
  \r\n\u2022 Bold Text \r\n\u2022 Bold Text Italic \r\n\u2022 Bold Display \r\n\u2022
  Bold Display Italic \r\n\r\nI've seen this option used a few times as well. It's
  is easier and faster to use in font menus (just change the style) but it's a little
  messy. I also dislike how it hides the distinction between text and display. \r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\nOPTION
  3 - One family with styles ordered: Size-Weight-Italic... but tricked to be grouped
  by Size\r\n\r\nFont Family\t\r\n\u2022 Display Light \r\n\u2022 Display Light Italic
  \r\n\u2022 Display Regular \r\n\u2022 Display Regular Italic \r\n\u2022 Display
  Semibold  \r\n\u2022 Display Semibold Italic \r\n\u2022 Display Bold \r\n\u2022
  Display Bold Italic \r\n\u2022 Text Light \r\n\u2022 Text Light Italic \r\n\u2022
  Text Regular \r\n\u2022 Text Regular Italic \r\n\u2022 Text Semibold  \r\n\u2022
  Text Semibold Italic \r\n\u2022 Text Bold \r\n\u2022 Text Bold Italic \r\n\r\nI've
  never actually seen this method used. It requires a little backend weight number
  fudging, are there any serious problems with this bit of trickery? \r\n\r\nOne of
  the benefits to this method would be that I could add \"Agate\" and \"Deck\" sizes
  in there and have them appear in the correct size order. Option 1 only works alphabetically.
  \r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    usability point of view I like option 3. If the family grew to monumental proportions,
    it might be easier to go with option 1, but with the style list you have I vote
    for option 3.\r\n\r\nOn a related topic, I've always wondered if Adobe will ever
    implement something where stylistic sets can be given custom names that will be
    visible to users from their app menus. That way you could get aggro with consolidation
    and just have all your optical sizes built in to one base set of fonts."

    depends upon what software you\u2019re talking about and what work habits one
    has.\r\n\r\nIf weights and styles are named & numbered in a proper and completely
    parallel fashion, then in InDesign you can change just the Family (if you\u2019re
    working from the control bar or character palette) and it will match the style.
    Same in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re working from InDesign\u2019s Type > Font
    menu, then selecting the Family alone won\u2019t do anything, true. You have to
    select the Family and slide out the flyout to the style. But that\u2019s not really
    a two-step process. If that\u2019s your work habit, then you have to do the same
    motion to change the Style anyway.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, Quark doesn\u2019t distinguish
    Family from Style, so you have to change both at once anyway, and again, it\u2019s
    not really a two-step process. \r\n\r\nNot sure what problem you\u2019re trying
    to solve.\r\n\r\nOption 3 is clever, but I side more with Nick Shinn. With a list
    that long, I might just focus on the first set of sizes and not realize that there\u2019s
    a whole \u2019nother set that starts over again."

    just thinking through the best way to set things up. I've all but decided to go
    with Option 1.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised no one mentioned Option 2, which is very close
    to what Adobe uses in their Pro fonts. They do one family with a weight-size-italic
    style but follow OpenType naming specs and drop \"Regular\". It seems to get overwhelming
    very fast, I would need a taller monitor to select something in Minion Pro. \r\n\r\nFont

  body: "Option 1! As Kent already said, you only have to select the complete text
    and pick up the other family from the font family menu in Indesign. Option 3 is
    also nice, if you, as Andreas said, abbreviate Display and Text, although I would
    prefer to have the text styles first in the list (You maybe can do that by faking
    the width classes in the fonts, but I am not sure, if Indesign also uses the width
    classes by building the order.):\r\n\r\n\u2022 D Light\r\n\u2022 D Light Italic\r\n\u2022
    D Regular\r\n\u2022 D Regular Italic\r\n\u2022 D Semibold\r\n\u2022 D Semibold

    Light Italic\r\n\u2022 T Regular\r\n\u2022 T Regular Italic\r\n\u2022 T Semibold\r\n\u2022
    T Semibold Italic\r\n\u2022 T Bold\r\n\u2022 T Bold Italic\r\n\r\nYes, that it
    is much clearer. You also could abbreviate Italic to Ita. (\"Italic\" was a keyword
    in Indesign and in case of Type 1, as far as I remember, even parts of the string
    \"Italic\" like \"Ita\". Again, as far as I remember. In other words, Indesign
    made the order with the help of that keyword. Or was it OpenType? I only remember,
    that it was a keyword and that there was a difference in the order, when I changed
    the name to \"kursiv\" for example.) Alternatively to the weight names, you also
    could use numbers.\r\n\r\n\u2022 D 1\r\n\u2022 D 1 Ita\r\n\u2022 D 2\r\n\u2022
    D 2 Ita\r\n\u2022 D 3\r\n\u2022 D 3 Ita\r\n\u2022 D 4\r\n\u2022 D 4 Ita\r\n\u2022
    T 1\r\n\u2022 T 1 Ita\r\n\u2022 T 2\r\n\u2022 T 2 Ita\r\n\u2022 T 3\r\n\u2022
    T 3 Ita\r\n\u2022 T 4\r\n\u2022 T 4 Ita\r\n\r\n(I would not use the weight class
    numbers 100\u20131000 for the names, because of potential trouble with style linking,
    when they are chosen correctly and irritations for the user of the menu, if they
    are not chosen correctly.)\r\n\r\nOption 2 is very irritating.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis
    also would work, because Indesign makes a difference between small and capital
    letters:\r\n\r\n\u2022 t Light\r\n\u2022 t Light Italic\r\n\u2022 t Regular\r\n\u2022
    t Regular Italic\r\n\u2022 t Semibold\r\n\u2022 t Semibold Italic\r\n\u2022 t
    Bold\r\n\u2022 t Bold Italic\r\n\u2022 D Light\r\n\u2022 D Light Italic\r\n\u2022
