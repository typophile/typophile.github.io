body: "G'day peeps,\r\n\r\nI'm new to page design and layout and I'm looking for a
  few pointers on laying out the grid (especially for books). When I read advice on
  page layout, the golden section is frequently mentioned in reference to the size
  of the text block on the page; but I've just tried this and there seems like a lot
  of space around the text (as in too much, especially the bottom margin) and I'm
  concious that I don't come across many books which reflect this process; does anyone
  actually use the golden section for book design? Are people using a tweaked version
  based on similar principles?\r\n\r\nI feel like the GS would work well for art books
  and books with lots of marginal notes but it seems very excessive for a paperback
  or a cheap short-run A5 lecture series (just ... you know, like for example :) So
  what do you use? Also, do you have systems for deciding where to put the page numbers/running
  heads?\r\nthanks for any trouble\r\n\r\nNick"

    time, but I've been designing art books for over 20 years and have never (consciously)
    used the GS or any tweaked version, nor was I ever taught to.

  body: "Think with the whole body and soul.\r\n\r\nHi Nicholas\r\nForget about grids
    first... design the layout first add the grids and alter it when you have the
    best design down.\r\nThe best way of designing is taking 3 spreads of the book.
    eg: title spread/content, 2 typical spread. Try different layouts and type treatmetns.
    Be creative and yet functional expecially the polios. But before you start, look
    at other best design samples and see that you are most imspired, be influence
    and then create your own layout... the best design is when you create you know
    in your heart you have a winner! Good Luck!\r\n\r\nAD Shamiko"

    enough.\r\n\r\nYes, as you (and Shamiko, thanks) can probably guess, I've been
    doing what I think/feel looks OK and that seems to go OK, but I do feel from time
    to time a bit like I'm designing in a bubble so I'm interested in finding out
    any systems people had for resolving this and especially theory as it relates
    to the GS. It seems so intersting and how cool is it to say you design using a
    secret formula but in practice it's a bit hard to see how it could be applied
    usefully.\r\n\r\n--N"

    the golden section as used in old books:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/golden.jpg\r\n\r\nExample:
    If the vertical height (or depth) of the type area on the right-hand page is measured
    from the first top-right word \"autem\" to the bottom-right catchword \"mente\",
    and if the resulting measured height is divided by 1.618, you will get the mathematically
    exact line width. Contrariwise, if you measure the line-width of e.g. the first
    line on the left-hand type-area (i.e. \"ptis ... iudica-\") and multiply the resulting
    measured width by 1.618, you will get the mathematically exact height (or depth)
    of type-area (from top-right \"iudica-\" down to bottom-right catchword \"In-\").
    Note that the catchword is included into the type-area of old books.\r\n"

  body: Keep in mind that if you're designing a book that will be perfect bound and
    won't open flat, you'll lose quite a bit of page space in the gutter. That has
    to be taken into account in designing a layout and grid. Also, in a book with
    a reasonable page count, the pages "feather" on the outside, making it look as
    though the outside margins are wider.

  body: "I was lucky enough to learn how to design books before the computer (and
    equally lucky to have the computer come along when it did!) and back in the day
    we actually drew up the grid and moved the elements around by hand before we settled
    on a look we liked. I learned to try to \"see\" the page before I started.\r\n\r\nFor
    text-only books it's often driven in part by the cast-off. Once I choose my font
    and leading, then I do a cast-off (number of words in the document divided by
    page count) to determine how many words per page. Then I set up my margins in
    order to achieve that. Whether you give it more space on the top or on the sides
    is a matter of choice.\r\n\r\nArt/illustrated books present more of a challenge.
    Some books call for (or have room for) a more open design, some call for a flexible
    design where you can accommodate lots of different page-layout options. I'm working
    right now on a photography book where the pictures are very formal and have a
    strong horizon (landscape photos). I chose to lay out the text pages with a low
    sink so that the page has a \"horizon\" as well.  I want the text design to take
    a back seat to the pix so I'm keeping it really clean. \r\n\r\nSometimes you want
    a varied, dynamic, asymmetrical page. I've done cookbooks and interior design
    books that have sidebars, notes, different types of text, large and small pix
    where I would do a two or three column design that can work these various elements
    in. \r\n\r\nBut again, it helps to try to visualize the look of the book before
    you start or your head can start to spin with all the different options. I have
    never even considered the \"golden section\" in any of my book designs."

  body: "As Patty and others have indicated, the Golden Section is not always that
    useful for today's books. I've never found the oft-cited formula, \xE0 la Tschichold
    et al., applicable. Publishers find those margins excessive and wasteful these
    days. Plus, there are too many other parameters either predetermined or otherwise
    constrained.\r\n\r\nThat said, I have on occasion made use of the 1.618 proportion.
    It's pleasing, and when it works, great. \r\n\r\nMore important is the concept
    of Proportion in general (of which the Tschichold diagram is but one example).
    Deliberate and pleasing relationships between trim size, margins & text block,
    type size & leading, location of running heads & folios, etc. These are all important
    and work together to create a whole.\r\n\r\nOne important thing that you need
    to keep in mind is that a book is a three-dimensional thing. Gary mentions one
    aspect, which is that there is a very real consideration for the inside gutter
    depending upon binding method (and even different binderies). Whenever possible,
    take your sample pages, trim them up and stick them inside a dummy book. If you
    can't get a blank bound dummy with the same dimensions, page length, and stock
    as your final will be, then try to find a published book with specs as close as
    you can, and stick your pages in that.\r\n\r\nSomething unique happens to a design
    when it curves into a binding and you perceive it in the context of a book's dimensional
    form in space with thickness and volume. I frequently mock up several pages and
    put them into a dummy in sequence, so I can get a proper perception of pacing.
    This is particularly useful with the front matter, since pacing is most evident
    in the beginning sequence.\r\n\r\nHope this is useful.\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: Kent speaks the truth - you really won't know how your book will look when
    you just see it on the screen. And beware the gutter. One of the first books I
    ever designed was on the making of Gone with the Wind, and I had a lovely double-page
    spread of Rhett and Scarlett kissing - right in the gutter. It also drives me
    crazy if I have to crack the binding in order to read all the text easily.

  body: When photos or maps span a spread in a perfect bound book, layout can be particularly
    tricky to avoid having part of the graphic hidden  in the gutter. What I do in
    cases like this is create left and right "halves" of the graphic, actually more
    than halves, because I make some overlap in the middle, sufficient that when the
    book is bound, the graphic seems visually complete. It's not a perfect adjustment,
    but if you get it right, it comes close to appearing a single uninterrupted image.
    As Kent mentions, nothing beats experimenting with a bound book (dummy or real),
    taking into account the location in the book (front, middle, end).

    compiling an advice text-file*.\r\n\r\n<cite> If you can get familiar enough with
    the information the content will lend itself to a grid automatically. </cite>
    good point, totally agree, but the spectre of budget is always hanging over my
    head in this small pub. company, I would love to let content determine layout
    but often it's a cost thing. for example I would love to employ generous margins
    on more text-booky works to use it for photos and call-outs but while it obviously
    looks better and works better it does feel a bit luxurious -- that said I haven't
    ever tried it on to see how it goes down...\r\n\r\nGenerally I do allow for a
    generous gutter and have never had problems but I've never tried a double-page
    photo spread, so Gary, your trick is worth remembering. I've read that your outside
    margin should be the same size as your gutter\r\n\r\nInteresting Patty, that you
    know your page count before you begin laying up the text, who decides this? Wouldn't
    this force your hand in terms of deciding your margins? Oh BTW I dream of laying
    out a cookbook :) I love a well-designed cookbook\r\n\r\nHey Uli, that's really
    cool stuff! I like that the golden section is used but in an internal way, it
    really is pleasant to look at and the margins here do not seem excessive. On a
    side point, interesting to note as many as four hyphens in a row and that the
    show through is inconsistent (unless that's a printing rather than a setting issue)\r\n\r\nI
    prob. would use the dummy on more complicated layouts, I think fairly simple book
    settings of one text block per page are probably OK to be resolved on screen or
    with print-outs. On another side point, as horribly ugly as it would be, as a
    reader I would love to see spiral bound bindings for everything, my kingdom for
    books that lie flat and don't need hands or mobile phones or shoes to keep them
    open...\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks everybody again so much for the advice\r\n\r\n"

    On a saddle stitched book of 120 or so pages, then this is a major issue, as the

    ones will not. But this is usually compensated for in prepress."

    interested to know how the 'creep' is accounted for. I remember a few journals
    I've got back where some coloured tabs I'd put bleeding on the outside margin
    were different sizes. I assume you enter the weight of the paper, paper size and
    page number and the pre-press program adjusts the placement automatically, perhaps
    it's very difficult to get this right. "
