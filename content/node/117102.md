  profession during the mid-20th century (40s \u2013 60s)\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'd
  like to read personal accounts and/or descriptions of what the industry was like
  for type designers during that period. Subjects I'm especially interested in are:
  \r\n\r\n\r\n- What were the big foundries in the US at that time (ie, where did
  type designers want to work)\r\n\r\n- How did people go into type design\u2014were
  there colleges that taught that subject at that time or was it more of an apprenticeship
  path?\r\n\r\n- What schools, if any, offered courses and studies in type design
  during that period?\r\n\r\n- Was type design considered its own specialty/profession
  back then, or did it emerge out of a larger field?\r\n\r\n- What was the percentage
  of young women going into type design during that period? Was it rare/unheard of?
  (ideally, I'd love to read personal stories by women who did become type designers
  during that time.)\r\n\r\nSo far it's been hard trying to find specifics as most
  resources seem to focus more on the history of typefaces and typography itself,
  rather than the history of the type designers' profession. Any info, links, or book/doc
  recommendations would be most appreciated!"

    I do. But I will share a few thoughts.\r\n\r\nThere were definitely no degree
    programs or schools actively teaching type design as a degree program at that
    time, and AFAIK there were no college or university courses available in type
    design at that time. It was very much an on-the-job apprenticeship kind of thing.
    It was its own specialty/profession, although type designers often came from the
    larger field of graphic design, especially book design and the like.\r\n\r\nThe
    short-lived Master's program at Stanford didn't happen until the early or mid-80s.
    It only graduated five students (one of them being Carol Twombly). The next such
    thing anywhere in the west was the MA Typeface Design at Reading, which started
    around 1995. Then the Type & Media program at the Hague in 2002....\r\n\r\nType
    design was a very male-dominated profession back then. The only female type designer
    of that period that springs to mind for me is Margaret Calvert. One started seeing
    more women in type design toward the end of the phototype period, in the late
    1970s and early 1980s, with Fiona Ross, Veronika Elsner, Freda Sack and others."

    graphics, for headlines, by pre-made lettering, offered the major opportunity
    for the top lettering artists to become type designers\u2014in as much as they
    were working with the medium of phot0-typositor. \r\n\r\nMy take on the subject:\r\nwww.shinntype.com/Writing/GoldenAge.pdf"
