body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI need to create a bunch of Word templates that use 'standard' PC
  fonts (like...Times, Cambria, etc. etc. that would be found on most PCs.) My non-profit
  client runs a conference that takes place in different cities every year; the documents
  are accessed by all the staff members, drafted and printed out just days before
  the conference starts, using rental and clients' PC computers set up in a hotel
  room-turned-office.\r\n\r\nThe workshop's logo is attached, below. I think the sans
  serif font is Interstate light, and the 'th' is Caslon 540 italic.\r\n\r\nUp until
  now, they've been using Verdana (!) as a default bold header, and TImes New Roman
  as the body copy for documents, because those are the lowest common denominator
  fonts that all the computers are sure to have.\r\n\r\nAre there any other 'lowest
  common denominator' fonts that would pair well (or better) with this logo? I especially
  want to find a more elegant-but-commonly-used sans serif--I just don't know the
  PC font system so well.\r\n\r\nFor background info, the workshop attracts participants
  who are politicians, defense ministers, ambassadors, etc etc (= a pretty conservative
  crowd, so nothing too modern or stylish...)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJean\r\n\r\n"

    maybe would go with Franklin Gothic and Palatino."

  body: Segoe UI is a pretty decent font, is available in regular, bold, italic and
    bold italic, and has Script and Print versions, to boot.

  body: "Thanks for your insight--makes me feel better that I'm getting advice from
    respected authorities in the field! \r\n\r\nI will then stick to Times New Roman
    for body copy--and Arial for the headers, name tents, badges, etc. Now all I have
    to worry about is my mac knocking all the margins out of whack everytime I open
    a document.\r\n\r\nAt least I tried to branch out, but it seems like in this case,
    Arial and Times are the safest bets to keep the documents consistent from staff
    member to staff member. Thanks!"
