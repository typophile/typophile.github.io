body: So I&#39;ve been wondering, when is it OK to use a name for a font that&#39;s
  already in use? Clearly you don&#39;t want to mess with that frothing-bastard-foundry
  in Chicago, but &#34;Leviathan&#34; for example is used just fine both by Hoefler
  and Agfa-Monotype. I can see practical problems when/if multiple fonts share a name
  on MyFonts for example, and I understand that the legal aspect can&#39;t be totally
  ignored, but I&#39;m looking for some accounts of real-life experiences. <BR> <BR>In
  case you&#39;re wondering, specifically I&#39;m debating if I should bother using
  &#34;Pantagruel&#34;, which is being used by Scriptorium &#40;at least&#41;. What&#39;s
  another good classical name for a really big guy? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    pretty level headed, and if you ask nicely I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll sic their
    lawyers on you.

  body: '&#62; Mangonel <BR> <BR>Terms for medieval siege engines are often used indiscriminately.
    In this case by me as well... According to the indispensable &#34;The Crossbow&#34;
    &#40;Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey, 1903&#41;&#42; a mangonel is a very large <i>catapult</i>,
    not a trebuchet. And I&#39;m note sure which tended to <i>weigh</i> more, but
    the trebuchet certainly was much taller and had a longer range. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    BTW, a careful reading of that book seems to indicate that the trebuchet was actually
    invented by Archimedes for the defense of his home town &#40;which it did admirably&#41;,
    but was then lost to time until the Middle Ages - so it&#39;s much older than
    people say. <BR> <BR>&#62; too long and difficult <BR> <BR>But doesn&#39;t that
    make them more &#34;thought-worthy&#34;? When people wonder about how to pronounce
    a name, are they more turned on or off? Like I&#39;ve thought of this font name
    -Recital- which I would &#34;insist&#34; that people pronounce like in French
    - &#34;gheseetal&#34;. Not that I would try to even enforce that or throw a fit
    when I heard it misprononnced - just that that would generate interest.  :-&#62;

    which is now installed on several million computers worldwide. <BR> <BR>You could

    they might get a kick out of one of their names being used and presented before

    the Hobbit as an audio book and I love it all over again.
