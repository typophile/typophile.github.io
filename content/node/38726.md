  love love House Industries and their amazing Neutraface family, Display Titling
  was too fat and Display Bold too thin.  So I used Neutra Text Bold and wanted your
  opinions on ink traps (which I removed from the N on two samples) and balance, and
  the kerning, which admittedly is still not one of my strong points.\r\n\r\nFinally,
  the T in \"PRINT\" is not mechanically aligned to the \"E\" in \"MAGNATE\" \u2013
  real alignment makes the top look rather unbalanced.  Does the bottom one (c) look
  better or worse than the middle one (b)?"

  body: "First I just want to say how much I like the mark. Very clever use of an
    old trick.\r\n\r\nSecond, removing the traps is fine, I can see how it might be
    a good thing. However, shifting the T to align with the E makes me want to tell
    you the kerning is too loose in the NT pair. "

  body: Thanks, MT!  I think you're right about the NT pair, too.  Anyone else?  Usually
    Logos / Corporate ID Design is jumping but it seems pretty slow today.

  body: "The IN pair feels a touch too tight to me.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the ink traps,
    that's fine to build in for a smallish size print logo.  Just make sure the traps
    don't become too obvious so they become part of the actual design (i.e. like the
    Amplitude typeface).  If this is ever going to be used to make a 3D sign, though,
    those traps have to come out.\r\n\r\nI've seen this symbol before, but I can't
    place it.  It's probably not so unique that you should abandon it, but I thought
    it worth mentioning."

  body: "Well, the ink traps are from the original face, because I went with Text
    instead of Display; I didn't build them into it.  I think that for the sizes this
    will likely be reproduced at that House's original traps are way too extreme in
    this setting, although the ones on the A and M seem all right.\r\n\r\nAs for prior
    art, I didn't find anything similar during the research phase, but that kind of
    bums me out because I knew it was too good (IMHO) not to have been done before."
