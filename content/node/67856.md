  of penmanship and the art of the cursive hand. I think there is probably consensus
  that the *art* of writing by hand as a practical skill is in decline. This is nothing
  new though--even Cicero complained that his contemporaries' handwriting was a complete
  mess. At the same time, it might be too narrow to judge today's handwriting by 19th
  century standards in which penmanship conveyed education, social status, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm
  also interested in cursive handwriting's influence--past, present, and future--on
  printed and digital media. \r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell, where do you think we are headed?
  Has cursive died? Will it gradually evolve? \r\n\r\n--Kelsey"

    that most give up on by high school. Everyone now learns to type as a toddler
    and tap text on a cell phone by the time they're old enough to hold one.\r\n\r\nCursive
    should be introduced as an art project and those that show a knack for it be allowed
    to develop the skill, but let those kids who don't spend their time learning things
    that matter in the modern world."

  body: "harsh, I can't say i agree completely.\r\n\r\nWriting will never die, pens
    and paper simply have better market penetration than any device. It's in decline
    without doubt - although I would argue only a decline back to normality. \r\nI
    think there was a time in our recent history where writing became so essential
    we were probably using it too much - and placing too much educational emphasis
    on it. \r\n\r\nThankfully devices have taken the place of the communications workhorse...personally
    I think most crap sent via electronic mediums isn't worth the paper it's written
    on. There's a quote from the boondocks which sums it up pretty well <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ_qUvpyiIU\">\"nothing
    typed with someones thumbs has ever been important\"</a> (excuse the casual racism...the
    show is quite edgy...)\r\n\r\nRegarding cursive form, again indestructible. If
    it was ever forgotten, someone would reinvent it the moment they were too lazy
    to break the stroke. You could regard txt spk as a form of cursive if you wanted
    to get abstract."

  body: "@typerror: LOL thanks!\r\n\r\n@cuttlefish: I'm sure that many students jettison
    their handwriting development at the time it becomes more economical (or even
    required) to hand in typewritten papers to their teachers. \r\n\r\n@dezcom: thanks
    for the link!\r\n\r\n@_leigh: I hope you're right :)\r\n\r\n@all:\r\n\r\nSince
    typographic forms owe so much to the visual effect of hand written letters, I
    wonder what the future has in store. At one point, typography as a medium was
    being produced by people who had the experience of those nibs and ink present
    in their mind. Even Comic Sans captures writing with a drafting pen pretty well.
    At the same time, I realize the two can and have moved on their own paths of evolution,
    and that hand writing has also been influenced by typography (i.e. punctuation,
    space, and capitalization were not highly standardized prior to print). \r\n "

  body: "I'm really interested in the give-and-take between handwriting (and printing)
    and type. Humanist letterforms from centuries ago were made to emulate calligraphy,
    to an extent. Then type developed away from the written form into more modern,
    regular letterforms. Now we initially learn how to write (print) from geometric
    sans-serifs, which really haven't been around all that long, all things considered.\r\n\r\nAs
    a thought experiment, I've been working on (and will probably never finish) an
    \"ultra-humanist\" sans, which is composed of regularized forms of my print handwriting.
    We learn printing from geometric sans-serifs, which are useful because the shapes
    are easy to reproduce, but since they're not natural our print writing relaxes
    over time. What happens when we base type off of handwriting that is an evolution
    of handwriting that is based on type that is an evolution of type that is based
    on handwriting? (Hint: It kind of looks like Skia and Scala Sans' love child.)\r\n\r\nGenerally,
    I still use cursive whenever I'm hand-writing something that is directly addressed
    to someone else, like a thank-you note. Things that aren't intended to be seen
    by other people get print. Ironically enough, I use cursive in my journal, which
    is only meant to be seen by me."

  body: "DrDoc - I think you're hitting the nail on the head. I really like your idea
    of applying our modern design tools in a way that links typography back to the
    physical, human activity of writing. \r\n\r\nI'm sure there are people out there
    who couldn't care less about their own handwriting, but most of the people I know
    personally have at least some emotional feelings about their writing. Lot's of
    people hate their writing. Some take a lot of care to make it look beautiful in
    their own eyes. Furthermore, most people have a unique emotional connection to
    say, their grandparent's writing on a note they have. Whether consciously or not,
    people seem to respond on a very personal level.\r\n\r\nWe have an altogether
    different experience of the written word in the age of print. It reminds me of
    the \"the medium is the message\" argument (Marshal McLuhan). I believe his argument
    was that the Gutenberg printing press brought about the standardization of language
    in European countries, and the social norms that followed that technology brought
    about new traits such as nationalism. \r\n\r\nBy its very nature, the printed
    word can't capture the individualism of writing, but as it's very interesting
    (to those of us who think a lot about typography as a communication medium along
    with writing and speech) to consider the differences about how we experience the
    two forms, and about how the two writing media subconsciously affect those who
    use those media.   \r\n\r\n--Kelsey"

  body: I was born in the 70s. Most handwriting looked crappy then, most looks crappy
    now, but there were always and are still beautiful exceptions. There will always
    be people who <em>want</em> to write beautifully, and the means to learn have
    never been more freely accessible.
