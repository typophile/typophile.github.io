  fonts and have also used several online sources to try and decipher it but all to
  no avail.  It's late, I'm tired, my eyes are getting blurry and a proofing deadline
  looms...\r\n\r\nThe kicker is that this looks so familiar - I just KNOW I've seen
  it somewhere, but do you think I can remember? (Of course not...)\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have any ideas what font this is?  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any replies :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SampleText_6744.jpg]"
