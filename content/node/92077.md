  \r\nBetween the several options I am exploring, I came across the possibility to
  play around with some custom ligatures. \r\nHere attached you find some examples
  I came up with.\r\nI know they are not *there* yet - but I would like to hear some
  feedback on how to improve them and which direction to go.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n"

    are like.\r\n\r\nI will say one thing though, assuming she's of Turkish origin:
    the diamond in #1 makes for a nice allusion to how Turkish used to be written
    (in the Arabic script). Which might be moot though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: '#3 looks the most promising, but I would use a rounder italic. And the ligature
    should be wider, bolder (in the sense of less tame, but perhaps also in the sense
    that it could be lost when the logo is printed small).'
