body: "I had a stillborn baby boy early this year, after moving house the scan pictures
  were severely damaged. I want to revive the images to the exact standard we received
  them for our memory book. I am having issues determining what fonts are used.\r\n\r\nI
  appreciate all help and assistance greatly. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately mine is pretty
  ineligible, which I am distraught about! I have included various images which aren't
  copyrighted which use the same font as displayed in mine as it's from the same ultrasound
  machine. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FONT-1_6262.PNG]"

    body: Thank-you very much for your response! The machine used for my ultrasound
      was a Toshiba model - not sure if that's of any assitance. I can get most letters
      to match up except the "R".

  body: "I am sorry for your loss.\r\n\r\nThe font looks a bit like Univers (the E
    particularly suggests that); I think I've seen something similar to this on certain
    computer screens in things on TV. However, I was looking for pictures of NASA
    Mission Control, and didn't see anything like that there, only much smaller printing.\r\n\r\nThat
    the machine was from Toshiba, however, is <em>very</em> useful information; at
    least a web search might turn up more images of the same kind of print, even if
    the font has no name."
