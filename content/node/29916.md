  cosmetics group.  I have designed the type myself and I'm expecting you all to say
  bad things, but it is the first time I have designed type like this so I would love
  some constructive criticism.\r\n\r\nFire away!"

    large solid or when it gets smaller. \r\n\r\nMaybe try to get all the \"leaves\"
    travelling in the same direction?"

    it leafy.\r\nAnd for the base font I'd use a contrasty sans, like Beorcana (but
    not Optima).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Good for you, Tom.\r\n\r\nMy questions are not about the type itself (which
    appears to be a pretty reasonable response to the brief, the other respondent's
    comments notwithstanding), but\r\n\r\n1. What does the lettering look like in
    positive (black on white background) \u2013 is it strong enough to stand on it's
    own as a device?\r\nBecause\r\n2. Why is the proportion of that enclosing leaf
    shape so large? If you take that backgound shape away, or make it radically smaller,
    what happens then?\r\n\r\nGood luck with it."

  body: "The font Verve (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sooy/verve/) looks similar to
    what you have chosen, except it is more consistently thick. You could use Verve
    and change the dot in the \"i\" to be like the dot in the other.\r\n\r\nYour logo
    will not work at small sizes because The type is sized so small in the shape that
    when the shape is made small the type will be MUCH smaller. The large shape doesn't
    do anything for me. If you use it make it smaller and strategically placed."

  body: "ben's comments are exactly what I was wondering. Imagine this on a label:
    the actual name is going to very tiny if it is locked into this shape. \r\n\r\nIf
    they're a new company, you really want to maximise the visibility and consistency
    of the name if you're going to build awareness."
