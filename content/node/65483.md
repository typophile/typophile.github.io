  ID it, Identifont wasn't much help, and I can't trace the original designer or get
  a text version to extract the font. A design group said this font was supposed to
  be 'Garow' but they didn't have a copy of that font. I've searched all the normal
  foundries and found no reference to the Garow typeface, even after trying numerous
  spelling variations. \r\n\r\nA fellow designer recommended Perpetua as a close match,
  which it is, but it's not identical.\r\n\r\nI'd like to find the exact match. Any
  help?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nKK\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prem-logo_3779.jpg]"
