    about the \"S\". It's very consistent in my sample, but maybe it's just poor programming
    by whomever set up the embroidery machine instuctions :)"

    since they used Arial to write \"STUART GLADSTONE\" in some images, but whatever
    this other font is for others."

  body: Actually, the "S" is reminiscent of Gill Sans, but other letters don't match
    - I am starting to wonder if they mixed fonts in the same string of text.
