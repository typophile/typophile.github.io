body: "In black typefaces with low contrast, the weight distribution of the bowl of
  \"p\" and the likes often gets pushed outwards at 2 and 4 o\xB4clock (see illustration),
  making the diagonal B a whole lot wider than the horizontal bowl width C. Would
  you regard this as a problem? \"o\" in mask layer for comparison."

    And you're making the \"p\" have flat sides even though the \"o\" is round?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the value of B should ideally be somewhere between A and C to not become a bump
    in a vertically stressed typeface like this.."
