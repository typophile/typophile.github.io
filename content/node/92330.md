  and W's (amongst other letters)? My first example is from a design agency's logo.
  I'm thinking it was customized...I'm pretty sure my second example is a real font
  out there. Either way, I'm looking for a font that would have a curly R. Thin and
  bolder options would be nice.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
