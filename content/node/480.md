body: ' This has always perplexed me, in Illustrator when a font is converted to outlines,
  it seems to get a significant weight gain. <BR> <BR>Is this perception primarily
  just the on screen display of the face or does the font gain in the output as well?
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done a few tests and found that this is more apparent at font
  sizes below 10. . . <BR> <BR>Is there any way to counteract the affects of the font
  to outline process? <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: ' It does gain weight in output also &#40;even though it&#39;s more apparent
    onscreen&#41;. It&#39;s really strange, but I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s more significant
    on laser printouts than &#34;real&#34; printjobs. Anyway, I also want to know... '

  body: ' I was in Stuart&#39;s camp because I&#39;d see this effect with my own eyes
    and always wonder. But Joe might be right about the optical illusion. <BR> <BR>I
    did a quick &#39;color stack&#39; test at 8 pt. and 800 pt. with Helvetica UC
    I and found the differences to be imperceptible at either size, but I didn&#39;t
    try printing. <BR> <BR> <BR>When you zoom in and out, Illustrator redraws quickly
    and that&#39;s when I&#39;ve noticed the weight difference. <BR> <BR>An another
    subject, when you stroke with dashed lines, Illustrator doesn&#39;t let you create
    dashed outlines. Has anyone figured out a way to create dashed outlines? <BR>

  body: Font outlines are rasterized by ATM, which uses a different algorithm for
    turning on pixels than the one used by Illustrator. Put differently, fonts are
    hinted but other outlines aren&#39;t. The effect is visible even at 1,200 dpi
    on paper, and more so on screen. <BR> <BR>I think the effect has been mollified
    in Illustrator 10, where everything seems to be anti-aliased, but I haven&#39;t
    used the application enough to be sure.

  body: ' From my understanding: <BR>The algorithms for rendering fonts versus outlines
    are different, with respect to deciding if a border dot should be turned on or
    off. This translates to an average of half a dot of difference on the edge. On
    the screen, this is highly visible &#40;irrespective of the additional difference
    in rending method - b&amp;w versus gray&#41;. On a laser printer, it&#39;s very
    visible at text sizes, and even perceptible at sizes upto and beyond a single-fixation
    of the fovea &#40;at normal reading distance&#41;. On lino, it&#39;s generally
    perceptible at just below normal reading distance, which isn&#39;t so bad. <BR>
    <BR>On lino, the only real problem is when you&#39;re making specimens of a text
    face for close scrutiny, and you don&#39;t want to give the service bureau the
    fonts &#40;or they don&#39;t want to bother with them&#41;. An 8pt text block
    for example will be visibly darker. You can reduce this by going to the maximum
    resolution &#40;in case the resultant lower lpi doesn&#39;t matter&#41;, which
    can be above 3000 dpi. On the other hand, since almost any reproduction method
    will introduce &#42;some&#42; gain, you could view the result as being closer
    to the eventual output! But of course that&#39;s not quantitively controllable.
