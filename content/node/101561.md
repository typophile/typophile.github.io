body: "For about 30 years, I researched the original design that was imitated and
  popularized by Mr Eliyahu Koren (may he rest in peace). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Koren
  for detail about his life.\r\n\r\nKoren (Hebrew: \u05D0\u05DC\u05D9\u05D4\u05D5
  \u05E7\u05D5\u05E8\u05DF; July 23, 1907 \u2014 February 17, 2001), of the original
  Koren Publishing House, was a noted Israeli type designer in the fifties and sixties.
  But he did not produce many original typeface designs. As such, Koren really was
  not \"a master typographer\", although he definitely was a great type technician.
  I don't even feel that he was an outstanding graphic artist, the likes of the late
  wonderful graphic designer, Mr. Tzvi Narkiss, or the late phenomenal Mr. Isamar
  David. David, and less so, Narkiss, were great Jewish type designers. But the greatest,
  in my professional view was Mr. Henri Friedlander, who Ifotunate to be taught from.\r\n\r\nKoren
  studied in Nuremberg, Germany. He later immigrated to Palestine in 1933. Koren was
  employed as the director of the graphics department of Keren Kayemet, the Jewish
  National Fund, from 1936 to 1957. Please post his works from that period, as I am
  only familiar with classic Koren typeface, originally long before he was born, and
  the mediocre design he create for his Jewish prayer book. Each time I see it, I
  cringe, and can not believe a great person as he created it. Perhaps, Koren is larger
  than life.\r\n\r\nKoren founded Koren Publishers Jerusalem in 1961. His company
  published the Koren Bible in 1962. \"He published the Koren Siddur in 1981, and
  various religious texts until his death.\"\r\n\r\nKoren really was a poor designer,
  but an outstanding researcher. Mr. xxx Guttman's version of the reflects brilliance
  and originality, but Guttman was a humble religious and didn't pursue his greatness
  in the Israeli courts against the inheritors of the Koren Publishers Jerusalem,
  Had he acted as Narkiss, and brought a massive suit against KPJ, there would be
  word today by them to dishonor Guttman's memory.\r\n\r\nFor that token, I releasing
  Kesser(TM) which is a derivative of my older design called Crown. I decided to incorporate
  Guttman's brilliant innovations in his version of the same design that Koren used
  as the basis of his cloned design. In addition, Kesser contains other innovations,
  and is subject to US Copyright (I registered it at the Library of Congress in Washington,
  signed by the State of Israel in the International  Convention (see http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=128063).
  If there is a lawsuit, I will countersue in US Federal Court in Brooklyn, and cite
  as a precedence the case of Adobe versus Swifte, which Adobe won, citing my correspondence
  with the US Copyright Office, which I won. \r\n\r\nWhat are the remarkable innovations?"

  body: "Let's look at the letter Aleph of Koren, Guttman's version, and my Kesser.\r\n\r\nKoren\r\nSee
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koren_Type\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aleph_4291.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nGuttman's\r\n\r\nSee

    look alike, right?\r\nBut there are some subtle differences between them.\r\n\r\nLook
    at middle diagonal bar. \r\nThe top and bottom have very important improvements,
    which is lacking.\r\n\r\nThe top is better curved, with a smoother transition
    from the curve at the top to the body of the middle stroke. Look at the bottom!
    The eye gently reaches the bottom, in Guttman's design, but ends abruptly on the
    top tip of the bottom.\r\n\r\nNow, look at the bottom or third lower piece of
    the aleph.\r\n\r\nKoren's ends again poorly, abruptly, and inconsiderate of the
    viewer's eye. Do you see that?\r\n\r\nI decided to incorporate Guttman's great
    improvements in the lower two strokes, and introduce another advantage in the
    top stroke as well. \r\n"
