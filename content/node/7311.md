body: Hi, <BR>When setting some text all in lowercase with a sans serif font like
  Helvetica neue should I use the regular size numbers &#40;that lines up with capital
  letters&#41; or make them a smaller point size &#40; 80 or 90% smaller&#41;?  <BR>I
  don&#39;t know if smaller numbers are available or even appropriate for that font.
  <BR>I read in &#34;Rules of typography&#34; that one shouldn&#39;t use lining numbers
  with lower case and I don&#39;t know that applies to all fonts and if there are
  exceptions to that rule. <BR>Many thanks, <BR>Barbara

  body: I have occasionally set the numbers in a smaller point size this sort of instance.
    You need to experiment a little, because 8 or 9 point numbers set in otherwise
    10 pt text will look too light. <BR> <BR>This is easily solved with a superfamily
    like Helvetica. If you are using Helvetica Regular for the text, try setting the
    numbers in a slightly darker weight &#40;medium or semibold&#41;. This can even
    everything out, if I remember correctly.

    is why some typefaces have numbers that will look good in most settings, i.e.
    those in lower case. Check out our own FF Unit.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/51924.jpg"

  body: The numerals in FF Unit are what&#39;s generally called &#34;hybrid&#34; &#40;although
    they&#39;re a bit on the mild side for me in terms of extension&#41;, and I heartily
    agree that they&#39;re the ideal overall scheme. Sometimes though other styles
    &#40;like 3/4 lining&#41; can be better, if rarely. <BR> <BR>hhp
