  body: "First of all, I think it looks like it is a font, in spite of the fact that
    it has two different l's, for example. Those differences could be ligatures. The
    only similar font I can think of is <a href=\"http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/RE10222\">Quattr'occhi</a>
    from 2Rebels. The font looks like it was designed on an 'Etch-a-Sketch' toy, and
    so does your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It also resembles Gareth Hague's <a href=\"http://www.t26.com/fonts/Civility\">'Civility'</a>.
    In fact, it resembles it quite strongly, except that it is a vertical script,
    with a different 'a' type, among other things.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
