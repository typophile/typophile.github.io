body: "\"Kinross favours readerly typefaces\u2026\"\r\n\u2014from article about Robin
  Kinross in the summer <em>Eye</em>, by Rick Poynor.\r\n\r\nThis term originated
  as the translation of <em>lisible</em>, coined by Barthes in S/Z (1970) to describe
  easy-access texts, which one might now term reader-friendly.\r\n\r\nBarthes paired
  it with Writerly (<em>scriptible</em>), for difficult, author-oriented texts.\r\n\r\nPoynor
  has migrated the term from the purely literary to the visual, typographic realm.\r\n\r\n(Writerly
  wouldn't make the move intact, morphing to Designerly, I surmise, as Typographerly
  is a bit of a mouthful.)\r\n\r\nWhile the output of Kinross' Hyphen Press is reader-friendly
  in its understated manner of design, I'm not sure that describing it as Readerly
  quite supports the Readerly/Designerly dyad, because the intellectual overtones
  of the term suggest complex, sophisticated ideas. I also have the feeling that Readerly
  refers to a kind of bookish, old school typography that may be contrasted with Browserly:
  immersion vs. skimming.\r\n\r\n"

    On the other hand, "browserly" is quite apt...'

  body: "I can understand why as I typographic person sees a benefit in clearer definition
    and transforms nouns to achieve this. Why not, after all there are languages that
    have several words for snow, or for rice. I understand that to be an expert one
    might need to create terms to communicate an issue or an idea best to the peers.
    After all every profession has its own language in a way as well. \r\n\r\nJust
    generally I can't really understand the need to create adjectives or adverbs out
    of nouns. Nouns are nouns because they carry a strong message, a dual state, to
    be or not to be. I heard people using \u201Cstatementy\u201D or \u201Cshow-stoppery\u201D
    and similar terms, and I think it waters down the message and the language. A
    statement is a statement or it isn\u2019t. If it failed to be a statement it is
    an attempted statement for example, which is a better description than statementy,
    which doesn't say anything. \r\n\r\nMaybe it\u2019s just me not being an English
    native, and it sounds odd to me, comparing with the \u201Cproper\u201D variants
    I learned. But as language develops it may feel more \u201Cnatural\u201D to native
    speakers. "

  body: "A literal etymological operation on <em>lisible</em> would yield readable;
    but since that isn't what the French word means, if the intent is to speak of
    a typeface as being comfy, cozy, warm and fuzzy for the reader, \"readerly\" would
    be an ideal word to carry that meaning, which is not truly carried by any existing
    word that I know of.\r\n\r\nThis does not say though that I entirely disagree
    with Old Nick saying that this \"is one neologism we can do without\". Because
    while it carries a particular meaning well, it's not really a <em>useful</em>
    meaning.\r\n\r\nBy that I mean that there has already been a discussion in this
    forum on the difference between \"legible\" and \"readable\". A legible typeface
    is one where the letters can be made out easily even under bad viewing conditions;
    a readable typeface (the appropriate goal for a text face) is one that minimizes
    strain and effort for extended periods of reading.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that \"readerly\"
    has a different meaning from \"readable\", it would seem to mean a typeface that
    <em>appears</em> to be readable; one that shouts out how well suited it is to
    the reader. But crystal goblets aren't supposed to stand out! So the term readerly
    seems like it's a word used to specify <em>ersatz</em> readability instead of
    the real thing; the meretricious appearance of readability.\r\n\r\nOstentatious
    use of oldstyle faces - most of which, fortunately, <em>are</em> readable in addition
    to readerly - and older Transitional faces (Baskerville, Bell) would be one result,
    not particularly disastrous in itself, because most of those are actually very
    good typefaces. But the potential for getting the wrong thing when you ask for
    the wrong thing is there."
