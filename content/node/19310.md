  I had been using Font Reserve in OS 9 which I basically loved but they don't seem

  basically sucks. It has a nasty habit of activating all my fonts without my asking
  it to, my \"collections\" get mysteriously deleted, and it won't activate/deactivate
  fonts when I open individual jobs. It also has very limited preview options. I've
  heard that Suitcase is good now - I ditched it years ago.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n(forgive

  body: "<cite>Font management in OSX is painful.</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree. However,
    this is partly because Mac OS X is the most feature-rich operating system ever
    in terms of typographic functionality. It supports more font formats than any
    other platform. Windows doesn't have any way of isolating font activation per
    user. Windows also doesn't have any system-wide API that would make auto-activation
    possible, and I don't think Vista is going to be adding it. While these features
    were present in OS 9 to some extent, the way they were implemented meant that
    there was a much greater danger of system instability. Also System 9, for practical
    purposes, never provided much language support. \r\n\r\nThis comment, of course,
    is from the perspective someone using a Latin-based language with an interest
    in graphic design. John Hudson would be quick to point out that Windows wins in
    terms of support for complex scripts such as Arabic. "

  body: "@ Paul, my solution is to turn off the optional fonts in the System Fonts
    folder and let OS X just use the locked fonts. You can delete those directly off
    the computer but I keep them there, they are mostly all at the bottom of the font
    list in programs anyhow. \r\n\r\nI don't know how you set your fonts up but I
    create folders for the Foundries and place the respective fonts inside, and you
    can create sets inside there as well or on their own. That way I never deal with
    having all fonts in the same massive folder. I use FEX at home, and used to work
    out of my house. I recently moved to a studio and use it here as well, I love
    it. The only time it's gone funky on me was when I tried to preview a corrupt
    font. Other than that activation and management has been instantaneous between
    programs.\r\n\r\nAlso, on my HD I created a font folder where I keep my fonts
    and organize my own fonts and have the preference set so FEX does not copy or
    move anything for me."

    allow modification:\r\n\"2.6. You may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer,
    decompile, disassemble, alter, or attempt to discover the source code of the Font
    Software. If you want to make modifications to the Font Software, you must obtain
    the prior written consent of FSI.\" \r\n\r\nSo, if I want to run FontDoctor on
    a FF font, I need to get a letter! (And of course, there's no assurance I _will_
    get one.)\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure what these no-mod rules are for. I've been
    told that allowing mods increases tech support difficulties, but I wonder, is
    Adobe flooded with tech calls for font mods? Was Linotype, when their MyFonts
    EULA allowed mods? It seems that most people who actually read and abide by EULAs
    would be able to understand a clause indicating that modifications would not be
    eligible for support. \r\n\r\nThese clauses offend a foundry's most fastidious
    customers, customers who actually care about type, while leaving the uninterested
    unaffected! What a strange business approach: we only want customers who aren't
    interested in our product. I certainly won't buy font from outfits with that attitude.\r\n\r\nBy
    way of contrast, look at Village's EULA:\r\n\"You may modify the fonts for your
    own purposes, but the copyright remains with Village, and the number of computers
    covered by the license remains the same. You may not commission a third party
    to modify the fonts without first gaining permission from Village. You may not
    sell or give away modified versions of the fonts.\"\r\n\r\nThat seems to cover

  body: "There are several things that can go wrong with traditional Mac fonts that
    simply don't occur with later (data fork only) font formats. Some of these things
    occurred because of the way fonts worked under Mac OS 9 and before. For example,
    under Mac OS 9, the Finder would actually open fonts in a read/write mode and
    change font IDs if necessary. The Finder could modify fonts! (This cannot occur
    in OS X)Also, modification of font suitcases was an accepted practice under OS
    9 and before. There is a lot of junk out there. \r\n\r\nIn these cases, the 'modification'
    by Font Doctor isn't related to outline shapes, hinting, kerning or other design
    aspects of the typeface. Typically the fixes are simply repairs to the structure
    of the font suitcase. In my experience, if table data is bad, FontDoctor lists
    it as irreperable. \r\n\r\nIn some cases font vendors may not be as forthcoming
    with replacements as Linotype seems to be. Many older vendors have disappeared.
    Font vendors depend upon selling fonts, and also re-selling the same fonts later.
    I don't think it is reasonable to expect Linotype to help peoeple use fonts they
