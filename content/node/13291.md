  machines that leverage notan to create good boumas\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost like
  nanotechnology! Ha! Ha!\r\n\r\nHrant, does achieving this preclude style or expression?
  Is there only one\r\nway to achieve it? Also, is there an empirical way to decide
  what a \u201Cgood\r\nbouma\u201D is? Do you have examples? I would think typographic
  context would\r\nbe a qualifier in each example.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nI think Design must
  always include style (what I call aesthetics) and\r\nexpression, although in a very
  different way than in Art - sort of in\r\nspite of the designer, instead of as a
  purpose*. I'm talking about text\r\nfonts here, which I see as qualitatively different
  than display fonts\r\nwhere aesthetics are often at the heart of things. I'd say
  that a good\r\ndesigner tries to balance form and function, style and optimal boumas.\r\nFor
  example in Patria I've made some glyphs \"too bulky\" for what I see\r\nas ideal
  readability, but it was a conscious sacrifice, a gambit, so as\r\nto give the face
  a certain masculine style. You can -and should- bend\r\nboth form and function,
  you just have to know how far you can bend\r\nthem, under what contexts, and with
  what effects.\r\n\r\n* Anything made by a human cannot avoid expression, and anything
  made for a human should not. But in design, expressing yourself is not the purpose,
  it just happens. Design is the artful balance of compromises; Art is basically just
  expression; although neither ever exists in a pure state, always in an admixture.
  Or: An artist wants to express himself; a designer wants others to express themselves.
  An artist creates; a designer serves. Etc. etc. etc.  :-)\r\n\r\nSo there can be
  no \"perfectly\" readable font - yes, context is everything.\r\nAnd style is always
  there, so that removes the chance of singular solutions.\r\n\r\nEmpirical determination:
  I think it's possible, when a very narrow\r\ncontext is defined. But it's also extremely
  difficult; I myself have\r\nyet to encounter sufficient maturity (and dough!) in
  the cognitive\r\npsychology field to really nail down immersive reading.\r\n\r\nExamples?
  Here's a really cheap one:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    solutions.\r\n\r\nI would add that art and design create moving targets for science
    to understand.\r\nIf what defines humanity is that which cannot be reduced to
    numbers and automated, then it's our duty to keep redefining ourselves against
    our technology, by inventing new kinds of meaning which defy measurement. Come
    to think of it, this applies to pure science as much as to the humanities.\r\n\r\nExamples:
    the invention of photography drives art into the non-objective; Newtonian physics
    reduces people to biomechanical status, quantum theory puts the mystery back.\r\n\r\nI'm
    afraid I don't find present state-of-the-art of reading theory very interesting,
    too much based on behavioral lab research. I'd prefer something more theoretical,
    like cosmological theory.\r\n\r\nI have a theory that everything you've ever read
    in a particular typeface colours your understanding of what you read in that face.
    And everything that's ever been set in a typeface has a bearing on the meaning
    of text set in it. \r\n\r\nIf the brain is a quantum computer, the process of
    reading must be full of quantum effects. \r\n\r\n"

    this is something essentially impervious to cultural shifts - it has more to do

    \r\n\r\nThat seems entirely artificial.\r\nI don't fight against my kitchen knife.\r\n\r\n>
    quantum theory puts the mystery back.\r\n\r\n?\r\nIt's still science, just like
    Newtonian physics. Just because something is harder to understand for laymen doesn't
    mean somebody whose job it is to worry about it professionally should be \"mystifed\"
    by it. So for example readers don't want/need to know how humans read; if they
    see it as mystical, sure. But a type designer must do more than ooh & aah.\r\n\r\n>
    I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t find present state-of-the-art of reading theory very
    interesting\r\n\r\nI don't think it's supposed to be interesting of itself (except
    to cognitive psychologists). What should be interesting to a craftsman -somebody
    necessarily interested in the mechanics of reading- is what <strong>can</strong>
    be discovered through research. And clearly, people like Kevin Larson are making
    decent progress; they're <strong>trying</strong> - and we should encourage that.\r\n\r\n>

  body: "Hrant, I'm relieved that you recognize this inevitable element of design.
    Design is fundamentally making tools, and the best are the most elegant <em>and</em>
    the most functional. Now I can make the connection between your frequent mention
    of notan and boumas, and your affection for Legato. \r\n\r\nYour example reminds
    me that there are a lot of things that type people know, without being able necessarily
    to explain or quantify. Recent discussions and papers about reading, legibility,
    highway signage and the dyslexic have made it clear there is not enough research
    that takes advantage of the highly unscientific expertise of a type designer or
    typographer. While Science may be best not trying to understand design, it could
    use a healthy dose of design awareness. Even very humdrum tests have to be designed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile
    I've got some notan to wrangle."

    as much as it is mysterious or more to the point, non understandable (to the layman).
    But to take your example of photography, yes, it had the consequence of driving
    art into the non-objective but the invention also led to interest in the documentation
    of historical artifacts, and especially in the mid-nineteenth century, to interest
    in the Renaissance. Without the camera and this interest, William Morris would
    never have been inspired to begin his very influential typographic revival efforts.
