  body: No, I think I'm wrong. The M in the sample is different (it comes to a point,
    Houschka's doesnt), and does the tail on the R is not as curly.

  body: I didn't get the larger image, because the file has some time and the font
    is lost, it's all I got and I know it might be too difficult. Houschka is pretty
    cool too, but has some differences as you mentioned. Thanks Minimalista!

  body: I'm pretty sure it's Gotham with R either customized or borrowed from Houschka.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Norb_5488.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt is fairly similar
    to Houschka Pro, but my M doesn't come to a point and my Z does, and the R leg
    has more curl as you say. I'd also be interested to know what it is."

  body: Thanks for the insight fellas you were really helpful, Alex I tried Gotham,
    it looks very similar as well, but Houschka posted by Nick would be the best match
    I guess, maybe there are little tweaks there in my image.
