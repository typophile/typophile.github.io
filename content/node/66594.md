body: "Breaking long threads into multiple pages is a bad idea for several reasons:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>We
  associate <dfn>pagination</dfn> of this sort with the most vulgar commercial sites,
  which use pagination to artificially inflate pageviews, thereby raising advertising
  rates. The only other thing pagination does is infuriate readers who are just trying
  to get through the damned text.</li>\r\n\t<li>Nobody using Typophile has so primitive
  or fragile a browser/computer setup that a long thread (of mostly text) stands any
  chance of crashing a browser.</li>\r\n\t<li>Links on discussion homepages to so-called
  most-recent comments <em>never take you there</em>; you are taken to the <em>first</em>
  page of comments.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nPagination needs to be eliminated."

    true anymore. Since the recent upgrade, the links work now and take you directly
    to the newest thread.\r\n\r\n(I don't know if it's true, but I've assumed the
    threads are split up to reduce the server load and thereby improve performance
    of the site for users.)"

    the case in the beginning). \r\n\r\nBut Joe\u2019s \u201Charmful\u201D and \u201Cdeceptive\u201D
    are typically hyperbolic characterizations, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve gotten
    used to the pagination, and now that the New Comments link does go the last page,
    it is less annoying.\r\n\r\nStill, I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing this changed. But
    I\u2019m also open to a convincing argument in favor of keeping pagination, such
    as the one Mark suggests might be the case about server load."

    don't want to have to wait for 400 posts that I've already read to load just so
    I can read the new one at the bottom.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    all the \u201Cnew\u201D flags are gone."

  body: Come on Joe. First you complain about Flash taking too long, and now you want
    a 300 message thread to appear all on one page. If you want fast page opening
    time, you can't have it both ways.

  body: Take a look at that digg thread that had tons of images on it. That page would
    be slow as hell for those on dialup or dsl-out-in-the-boonies. Even those with
    dsl sometimes have a really bad connection.

  body: I appreciate pagination when browsing from my iPod, as scrolling superlong
    pages can be a pain. (Of course if a fully features mobile version of the site
    comes to pass, that will no longer be an issue presumably.)

  body: "Well, I load 300-response MetaFilter threads quite commonly. (Typical MetaTalk
    threads have 150 to 200 replies.) We\u2019ve just got text and avatars, people,
    and rare feature illustrations. That is not a lot for browsers to handle. You\u2019re
    all using good equipment and you can all handle it no problem. This isn\u2019t
    theoretical; I read lengthy forum postings all the time.\r\n\r\nThe server-load
    issue I have trouble buying into, but I note that it hasn\u2019t been confirmed
    by the shadowy owners of this site, so I doubt it even further."
