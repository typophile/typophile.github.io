    I'd posted it to my blog with the hopes of having my pumpkin carving skills corroborated
    by someone being able to ID the font I'd used as source material.\r\n\r\nAnd yes,
    it's our house number. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pumpkin-03_4582.jpg.jpg]"

    pretty nice carving job, now that I see what it's modeled after. I didn't notice
    the rounded lower terminals at first, and I expected the left side of the 1 foot
    serif to look more square perhaps.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks! Definitely the right-hand side of the foot serif on the 1 should have
    been a more like a simple rectangle. The gourd is an unforgiving medium.
