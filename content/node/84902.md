    post. It's small and grey on grey, but it's there.

    explanatory! :^)

    that ask for marking.

    font-related ones!)... \r\nSome sites have a system where anyone can flag a post,
    and then if enough different people flag it, it gets removed (or at least hidden)."

  body: "Weiwauters is mistaken. The icon in the upper right corner of each post is
    ostensibly a \u201Cbookmark\u201D for marking a thread (and thus adding it to
    My Marks, which can be accessed via the link under your login status at the top
    of the sidebar).\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know why the tool tip says \u201CVote up!\u201D
    since this isn\u2019t a voting button. I suspect that\u2019s a mistake (probably
    from copying a previous bit of code related to a short-lived experiment with a
    voting module). I\u2019ll bring it to the attention of the Punchcut folks.\r\n\r\nI
    can tell you that using the mark feature will not help with spam, since I won\u2019t
    ever see your marks.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief period when Punchcut experimented
    with a spam marking feature, but I don\u2019t know what happened to it. I can\u2019t
    honestly recall whether it worked well, since that was before I volunteered to
    be janitor on the site.\r\n\r\nSuch a feature might be helpful, but I can imagine
    it would also be subject to abuse. If you seriously want Punchcut to add the feature,
    I suggest starting a thread in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/1343\">Bug
    Reports and Feature Requests</a> forum.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, these occasional
    bouts of spam comments are actually only the tip of the iceberg. You guys don\u2019t
    see even a third of the spamming that goes on. Most of it gets caught and shunted
    off, to be dealt with by us volunteers out of public view.\r\n\r\nThe Comments
    sections are the most vulnerable to these spam fits because we don\u2019t have
    the Akismet Antispam module filtering the comments. It is still too prone to false
    positives, and filtering all comments right now would bog down the free flow of
    conversations.\r\n\r\nI check the General Discussions, Design, and Blog forums
    every morning and clear spam and block spam accounts. I also usually comb through
    a couple more times during the day. Sometimes I do a spot check through the entire
    Comments section in the Admin. I think Florian checks the Type ID forums regularly.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you happen to spend your time on Typophile before I get up and come online,
    then you probably will end up seeing a fair bit of the overnight spam. \r\n\r\nFor
    whatever reason, there are a few individual threads that have become spam magnets
    and are usual suspects for spamming. These spam bots seem to follow each other
    around or something. Also, commenting on spam seems to exacerbate the situation
    and increase the likelihood that a thread will become the target of future spamming.
    (Also, the comments look silly once the original spam has been cleared out.)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    it's a constant frustration that you'd much rather be shot of! I just got a bit
    fed up with the numpties who post the damn things in the first place (what DO
    they hope to achieve??), after seeing them pop up in a couple of otherwise interesting
    threads.\r\n\r\nStill, the situation is WAAY better than it could be. Over at
    [[http://forum.worldofescher.com/|World of Escher]] there was a tidal wave of
    spammy posts supposedly advertising cheap consumer electronics..."

    think putting a captcha on every new thread and comment would be draconian and
    really bog things down.\r\n\r\nBut I leave all that up to the Punchcut folks.
    I\u2019m just here to scrub the walls and take out the trash. ;-)"
