  short, I''m seeing more and more pamphlets and directories that come with a clear
  plastic cover on the front but not the back. To me, it degrades and cheapens (the
  perception of) the product. Is this the "new normal" in financially strapped times?
  Or is this a counter-productive cost-cutting measure? '

    own damn plastic cover</em>.

  body: "Spot on. That made me laugh! Thanks.\r\n\r\nBut for those that do print directories,
    the question remains: do I save fractions of a penny and look cheap, or do I put
    out a class act? My vote is for a class act."

  body: "It's functional and cheap, the 'plastic' side almost always points up, so
    there is no need to use it for the backside as well. \r\n\r\nThe use of plastic
    for covers is, to me, already questionable if you want to do a class act. But
    it helps with lastability and is cheap. Sometimes a class act isn't needed.\r\n\r\nIt's
    probably a choice based on 'how many people bother with the aesthetics of printed
    matter' Which isn't that high."

    saddle-stitched (stapled on the folded edge like a magazine) so the front and
    back covers are one folded piece of material.  \r\n\r\nAre you maybe referring
    to a gloss varnish on just the cover?"

    directory. I think there should have been no plastic either front or back, or
    it should have had clear plastic front and back.\r\n\r\nSome of you want to see
    a picture of a piece of clear plastic? "

  body: ">  it was a spiral-bound church phone directory\r\n\r\nOkay, that's certainly
    a binding method that would permit that, and I'd agree it seems odd to do the
    front but not the back. \r\n\r\nBut spiral binding is not generally used on higher-end,
    well designed pieces. It tends to be used on things run off at the local copy
    shop, so it wouldn't surprise me to see poor design choices."

    I think we\u2019re asking for a picture of the object in question. Or any example
    for that matter. I\u2019m pretty confidant we know what clear plastic sheets look
    like on their own."

    objects like this, thick black card stock on the back and a clear plastic sheet
    on the front has been a thing for as long as I can remember. The card-stock makes
    it stand up in your hand, and the plastic protects the cover. Simple pragmatics."

    binding]]. \r\n\r\nOther options are [[http://www.youtube.com/user/mybinding?v=_P4l20OETuw&feature=pyv|spiral

    comb binding]]. \r\n\r\nFor shorter runs, what you mainly see is plastic comb
    binding. At my house, the plastic-comb-bound church directory sits in a rack on
    the kitchen counter and gets dog-eared and ketchup-stained. I wish somebody had
    thought to put a plastic cover on it. "

    with those instant binding machines.\r\n\r\nI find the card back is more practical,
    helps stop the document folding over when standing on a shelf. \r\n\r\nBut these
    are rarely long-term documents, with small or no design budgets, so halving the
    acetate budget is probably justifiable.\r\n\r\nTim"
