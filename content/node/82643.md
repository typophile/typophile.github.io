body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\njust wondering if anyone can tell me what font is being used
  on the Adobe website, \"learn at your own pace\", \"find answers fast\" etc\r\n\r\nI
  presume this is using the new method of embedding font on a webpage? Also notice
  drop shadow on some of the text, I presume this is CSS3 etc.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be great"
