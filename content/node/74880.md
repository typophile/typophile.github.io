  a few more examples of identity systems that change configuration depending on their
  usage/various other parameters.\r\n\r\nOne example is the recent Nordkyn identity:\r\nhttp://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/where_the_cold_wind_blows.php\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\nCasa
  da M\xFAsica\r\nCity of Melbourne\r\n\r\nClose but not quite right:\r\nSECCA\r\nNYC\r\nAOL\r\nAnyone
