  Beta Bug Report</a>, however, since this isn't really a bug but rather a request
  for a new feature, I decided to start a new thread. Hopefully others will add some
  more ideas, and we'll all make our beloved Typophile even better.\r\n\r\nHere's
  mine:\r\nIs it possible to add a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink\">permalink</a>
  to each post so that they can be referred directly within the thread? I know it's
  already possible to do something like this http://typophile.com/node/17011#comment-103291
  but not everyone knows about it. In addition, one needs to loggin (or dig through
  the source code) to get the comment number. Thank you :^)\r\n\r\n(BTW, I noticed
  that this 'technique' doesn't work for threads with more than one page.)\r\n\r\n[Edit:
  <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/comments/gettingstartedwithajax?page=3#23\">A
  List Apart</a> does this too. Notice how the page number is included. I see now
  that we could do http://typophile.com/node/17011?from=50&comments_per_page=50#comment-105491
  \ but this is human-unreadable.]"

  body: "One thing that bugs me is how, when a topic extends to multiple pages, the
    \"new\" flags get wiped out before you can get to the last page of the topic.
    My workaround has been to add \"?from=0&comments_per_page=500\" to the link url
    so all the threads appear on the first (and only) page.\r\n\r\nRelated to this,
    I would like the topic page links (e.g., \"1  2  3 ... next page  last page\")
    to appear both at the top and bottom of topic pages. This would be especially
    helpful when there are lots of images to load on a page. For example, the only
    way to get to, say, page 3 of a topic is to got to page 1 first, then jump to
    the end of the page and click on \"3\". But if page 1 has a lot of images, the
    bottom of the page keeps jumping down as the images load making it hard to hit
    that \"3\". My workaround is to stop the page loading (leaving out any images
    that were loading). It's tricky to time it right--if I do it too soon, I may stop
    it before the bottom of the page has loaded. If the page links were also at the
    top, it would be much simpler.\r\n\r\nJust my 2\xA2."

    But you could put them at the top easily enough I would think--as I suggested
    at the launch--and the bottom as well, I would think. I believe the old version
    of typophile had this. Right now I have worked around the problem by dragging
    all the forum links to my browser bar. "

  body: "I took these out of the bug report:\r\nI agree with Mark; Could the link
    for going to the last page of a hot topic also be at the top, so that to check
    new posts at the end of the second page you don\u2019t have to scroll down. This
    would be especially useful for hot topics.\r\n\r\nIt is starting to seem to me
    that it would be good if the next release made the \u201CInsert image\u201D link
    about 5 times larger and have blinking arrows all around it. Maybe have them cycle
    through the spectrum with each blink. I think that would look pretty cool too.\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if there is anyway the comment posting box could have spellcheck?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
