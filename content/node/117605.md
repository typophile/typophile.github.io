  body: "If you take an _O_ and slice out the middle 1/5 you get this result. Otherwise
    this lettering is a pretty generic heavy sans in the style of Helvetica Extra
    Bold. The letters in CAN are really squeezed together. The original font would
    not have looked like this. Numbers could be Helvetica Bold Condensed, perhaps
    with some manipulation. I'm using font weights from an old Letraset catalog. Digital
    versions may call them something different.\r\nDon"
