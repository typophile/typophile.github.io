  body: Well, the original metal version of Palatino Italic had ascenders like that,
    but there was no Bold Italic back then. I do recall seeing "off" versions from
    other sources, such as Headliners International (a headline setting franchise),
    who would typically expand the weight ranges of "standard" fonts like Palatino.
    1994 is awfully late for something like that--well into the modern digital font
    era. Kind of puzzling.
