  body: "Looks familiar, but I can't place where I saw it.\r\nThe letters are a good
    example of 19th century ornate initials combined with foliage that intertwines
    with the letters and arabesques to form an elaborate frame. This is not hand lettering.
    Note the identical N. Copies for printers were produced by a process called electrotyping.
    Printer's specimen books circa 1900 and earlier included a section on eletrotyped
    intials. These initials were sold separately rather than as a font. A common practice
    was to produce only the most commonly used initial letters such as E and S, and
    ignore the rare ones such as X and Z.\r\nThese initials were not in the ATF catalog
    of 1897.\r\nYou mentioned \"Bohemian.\" Perhaps a foundry like Bauer? \r\nSome
    of the electrotyped  initials have been collected and digitized by fontmakers
    such as Intellecta, Greater Albion and GLC. Unfortunately their offerings do not
    include these particular initials. Perhaps another fontmaker.\r\nThe image appears
    to be a collage of printed material from various sources.\r\nPublishers [Dover
    and others] used to publish books with collections of decorative alphabets. This
    may have been the source used by the artist. If you know who the artist is, you
    could ask. Or you could do some research at a library with a collection of such
    books.\r\nIf you are lucky, one of our typophiles may have some info on these
    initials.\r\nDon"
