The font is great, of course, but there&rsquo;s a strange kerning value set between the lower case f and the open parentheses and brackets. The default kerning here is 126, which looks a lot. It can be manually adjusted, of course, but it would be interesting to know the reasons behind such a choice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I only have the original Kepler MM fonts to look at, but I think Florian is on to something.</p>
<p>Checking the AFMs for the Light Display masters, it looks like in Roman the parenleft-f pair would have a kern on the order of -20. But in the Italic, the parenleft-f pair gets a kern more like +110 to +130. Factoring in some interpolation, I imagine that&rsquo;s where the +126 value comes from and was just accidentally picked up from the Italic and applied to the Roman.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
I looked at this issue with Robert and he first thought it could be caused by a bad kern value in one of the masters. But then we looked at all the Roman fonts in the family and the kern value between the left parenthesis/bracket/brace and the &lsquo;f&rsquo; is pretty consistent. So, yes it&rsquo;s a bug, but we no longer have enough information to know exactly how it happened.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m going back to this thread because I don&rsquo;t want to create a new one about the same typeface.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that in Kepler the &ldquo;Th&rdquo; is set as a standard ligature.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kepler_ligature_5173.jpg]</p>
<p>(above: ligatures turned on by default; below: Th ligature manually desabled)</p>
<p>I respect the designer&rsquo;s choice, but from my point of view it would have been better to have it as a &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; ligature. When set at very small sizes, say 6 or 8 points, the &ldquo;Th&rdquo; ligature can be a little confusing to the reader&rsquo;s eye, with the two different glyphs resembling one single letter. Who types the text can correct them one by one, since you can&rsquo;t turn off a single ligature without affecting the others - a hard work if you&rsquo;re setting a book, for example. So I believe that having it as discretionary, as someone else suggested (in general term, not specifically to Kepler: <a href="http://lamb.cc/blog/2008/07/14/css-ligature-support/)">http://lamb.cc/blog/2008/07/14/css-ligature-support/)</a>, should help. Just my two cents!</p>

<p>You can use search-and-replace to do exactly that. At least, in InDesign it works&hellip; haven&rsquo;t tried it in QXP. Admittedly, this needs to be done after setting all the text, but it&rsquo;s not difficult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this to argue against having some way to turn off specific ligatures as a feature: I think it would be useful. But at least there is a work-around.</p>
<p>Also FWIW you&rsquo;ll find this as a standard ligature in a whole bunch of Adobe typefaces, including mine.</p>

<p>In InDesign CS4, this actually can be done live, on-the-fly, thanks to GREP styles: Create a character style that disallows ligatures. In your paragraph style options, set up a new GREP style and let it automatically apply the character style to every instance of ‘Th'.

<p>Yep - and here&rsquo;s how some Adobe fonts look, all of them set at 6 points:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TH_ligature_4267.jpg]</p>
<p>Ok, the quality of the image is bad - but I still think that the text reads better with this ligature disabled, as in the Hoefler Text, Cycles and Whitman examples. Though correcting the &ldquo;Th&rdquo; ligature is possibile with the search function, it would be better to have it as a separate choice. I&rsquo;m on Indesgin CS3, by the way.</p>
<p>On the same level, this leads me to think that it would be useful to have fonts with particular glyph options; I know some typefaces have it. For example, after setting a book in Hoefler Text, the author asked me if the Q cap italic could be changed with a more conventional one - an alternate glyph could have helped, in that situation.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Most of those Adobe fonts have optical size variants, so you should be using the appropriate one if you&rsquo;re setting text at 6-8 point size. I question the validity of critiquing their legibility at such small sizes, when variants optimized for those sizes are also available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from that, I don&rsquo;t see a legibility problem specific to the Th ligature in the samples shown. Indeed, I prefer it to the spacing created by the Th combination in the non-ligated examples. I think this is a matter of taste, though.</p>

<p>Ah, but Adobe doesn&rsquo;t kern pairs at all any more, except when they need special treatment. They kern classes instead. So in a typical typeface the bhkl will all be in the same class for kerning, and will get the same kerning against the T (if any). To un-kern the Th combo would actually <em>increase</em> the size of the font for no gain. Thus Florian&rsquo;s observation.</p>

<p>That would be an artifact of interpolating kerning values between different masters in MM space. Probably at least one of those masters had a significant kern, but some of the middle values might not. IIRC, Adobe filters values less than 5 from the exceptions, but it doesn&rsquo;t save any space to filter them from the class kerns, so I&rsquo;m not sure if they do.</p>

<p>Our kern filtering policies have varied quite a lot over the (OpenType) years. Probably some (or most) early OT fonts were not filtered at all, but eventually we did apply some post-processing to remove kerns below some value like +/-2. (The kerns would be commented-out of the input feature code.) Probably in some cases that value got up to 5, but I think 2 was regarded as pretty safe. I&rsquo;m actually not sure what has been done in recent fonts like Arno. Anyway, I recall that the filter was applied to all kerns &ndash; class pairs and otherwise &ndash; for quite a while, whether or not it actually resulted in size reduction. It was just a standard production step.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Although [[http://typophile.com/node/34310|<strong>this thread</strong>]] never did go far enough for me, &ldquo;[Bad] Kerning in Kepler&rdquo; is yet another example of <em>Unprofessional Fonts from Professional Designers</em>. <strong>Fonts should work out of the box,</strong> and not have to be modified by end users.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m at it, Kent Lew&rsquo;s <em>Whitman</em> is the most comprehensive, flaw-free text font I own (out of about 1900 fonts). It almost pisses me off, because it&rsquo;s my go-to font when I want legibility and readability. Which is to say that I wish I had more choices as good as <em>Whitman</em>.</p>
