  body: I've seen this happen before, although I'm not sure how it happens. You've
    somehow got two glyphs ("Q") with the same unicode value. You need to change the
    unicode value of one of them (probably to unencoded if it's an alternate).

  body: "After a closer look at each glyph, it seems there is no two \u201CQ\u201D
    with the same unicode value. What I've tried is to clear all unicode value and
    the problem seems to be solved, hoping that won't cause other problem.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Thanks to FontLab to solved the problem. I really had two Q. They suggested
    to look at my vbf file in the Index mode and the second Q was there. How this
    happened I have no idea, but when I've delete it, I was able to work with the
    OTF preview menu. The second Q was'nt visible in the Name mode neither in the
    Unicode one.\r\n\r\nThanks again  :^)\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
