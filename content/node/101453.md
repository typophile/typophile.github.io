body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nTrying to figure out which typeface this is.  It's a 1978 publication
  from the UK.  I figured the Q and W would lead me to the right font, but so far,
  no luck.  I suspect it's not available in digital format, but any pointers to the
  typeface in general are appreciated.  Looks like a serif-y version of Globe Gothic,
  but that's as close as I've gotten.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nPatrick"

    Guide, but when I use these characteristics nothing comes close.  I still wonder
    if more than one font is being used. The W is like Baskerville, but the majority
    of the other letters, except maybe the G, seem more like a version of Times than
    anything else I can suggest.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have any ideas?\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: i've been looking at this, and following bread crumbs and random thoughts.
    so i landed at Georgia, which in some ways looks like your sample. of course this
    is not the right font as it was designed much later. however, the designer of
    Georgia was active and designing at the time of the sample/publication, and in
    the UK. is it possible that this may be some of Matthew Carter's work?
