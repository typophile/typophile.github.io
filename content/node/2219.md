body: Hi Typophilers, <BR> <BR>I would be interested in design stuff that&#39;s made
  in your town, whereever you are outthere in the world.  <BR>I&#39;m living in Maastricht
  &#40;Holland&#41; and D&uuml;sseldorf &#40;Germany&#41; and we have some interesting
  stuff going on in graphic design. We could exchange flyers, brochures, photo&#39;s,
  typothings, and so on, if you would be interested. In that way you get to know what
  we do here, and I what you do over there. It doesn&#39;t have to be made by you.
  You could robb the local flyer display and anything you find on the streets and
  send that. I like more to have printed work than to see that on an internet site.
  The paper adds another dimension to the work.  <BR> <BR>Are there people who would
  be interested in something like that? <BR>I find that living out here can very fast
  become limited if you don&#39;t open your eyes and start to look around. In the
  old days people travelled all over the world and robbed countries of there national
  treasures to enhance there own. We could do the same on a friendly base.  <BR> <BR>If
  you would be interested, please reply, and we could get exchanging neat stuff.  <BR>I
  can&#39;t send the same stuff to everyone &#40;mail is expensive&#41; but a lot
  is possible.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren

    make a rotational system or something.  <BR>Besides, wouldn&#39;t you love to
    get a nice fat letter full of foreign design every once in a while? <BR>I&#39;d
    love getting something from Singapore. <BR>Come on, it&#39;ll be fun!

    of stuff to two other people to get the ball rolling. Each of these people send
    three pieces back to the first person, and send three pieces on to other people.
    Each recipient sends three things back to the person who sent to them, and three
    things on to other people. '

    start collecting stuff right now. <BR> <BR>I always collect stuff when I travel,
    but back home, I kinda just take everything for granted.  <BR> <BR>Should we come
    up with a criteria for the items collected? Eg: Does it need to be designed locally?
    <BR> <BR>More later then.'

  body: Hi robbers, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m back. I had a really hard few days with at work.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; sounds interesting. hey, if you dutch would quit making such pretty
    stamps maybe mailing stuff wouldn&#39;t be so expensive ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Isaac.
    We are good, aren&#39;t we. We have a rep to keep up. <BR> <BR>&#62; If more people
    take part, won&#39;t you end up like sending out 10 sets of everything?  <BR>
    <BR>Karen. I think Kenn likes to have the real deal. He would like to have the
    piece I&#39;ve found in the streets, smell, taste and everything included. I can&#39;t
    send everything to everyone. I&#39;ll do what I can on a personal base. I&#39;ll
    look especially around for one person.  <BR> <BR>&#62; You could set it up this
    way. The first person, e.g.  <BR> <BR>John. Not a bad idea. If someone would be
    interested in something like this we could try it out. This only goes with thing
    you can get for free or buy. Things I find in the streets go to Kenn. ;-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Does it need to be designed locally?  <BR> <BR>Karen. Not neccesarily.
    I like everything out of the ordinary. If you find something Russian in Tokyo,
    it&#39;s also OK. <BR> <BR>Kenn. I&#39;ve found some things for you on the streets.
    I&#39;ll have to get a feeling for what you like, so please give me some feedback
    on the stuff I send you.  <BR> <BR>Later, <BR>Ren
