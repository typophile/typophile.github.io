body: "I'm not sure if this is specific to my universe or not, but when I am making
  a vector object in Illustrator, in this case a logo, if I turn something into a
  compound path the elements that are reversed out become much much fainter.\r\n\r\nConversly,
  if keep those reverses as solid shapes and just layer them over the background fill
  then the reverse are strong.\r\n\r\nThis happens both on screen and on paper!\r\n\r\nWhat
  the hell?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't mind it so much, but in the case of a logo, I have to
  have a bunch of extra shapes in there so that it will work.  Kinda gets messy.\r\n\r\nI
  didn't have this problem before CS though.\r\n\r\nIn my attachment the logo piece
  uptop is compound, down below if layered/non compound.  I'd really love some insight
  on this. Oh, and I should add, those are the same EXACT shapes.\r\n\r\n"

    i can't really make out what could be going on.

    post a pdf.\r\n\r\nIn that pdf both stars are exactly the same size.  what gives?"
