body: "I'm designing a logo for a natural toys and baby goods store, and the client
  has suggested that the type look \"folk-y\". When she says this, I take it to mean
  that a lot of their toys are handmade and in a traditional (but not necessarily
  retro) style. I've considered Old Century Schoolbook because it looks like old Dick
  and Jane books, but I think she's more interested in something a little more organic/hand
  drawn. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? \r\n\r\n"

    Peapods, based out of Minneapolis. They carry a lot of toys that Waldorf schools
    have in the classroom. . .wooden cars and trucks, blocks, German dolls with expressionless
    faces, fairies\u2014 that kind of thing. \r\n\r\n"

    when I think of wodden toys and monitossori products, I think less 'folky' and
    more 'modern european'. "
