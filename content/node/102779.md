  with the \"logo\" on the old poster they gave me, which they do not know or have
  the typefaces for. Could someone tell me what the typeface on the bottom is? The
  one that says Houston May 23 - 26?\r\n\r\nThank You"

  body: just for reference, if it helps at all... on the event website the titles/info
    on the main splashscreen (rotates through guests) is either Galant (my personal
    choice) or Galactican. Might be well to use that anyhow. ?
