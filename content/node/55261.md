  a school project at the academy of art in san francisco where I need to create a
  brochure for a fictitious space tourism company and the typeface used on the \"state
  of the planet\" text on this seed magazine cover is the EXACT PERFECT typeface that
  I envisioned in my head for this project. If anybody can identify it or something
  similar I would be so grateful! thanks for your help!"
