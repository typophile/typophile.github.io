  body: "I provide a brief description of some of the thinking behind Augustus, special
    for the typophile crew. A small piece of trivia: Stephen Coles suggested the name
    Augustus Gloop when I first showed a display sheet here on typophile over five
    years ago. Thanks Stephen.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AugustusDisplaysheet_5028.jpg]\r\n\r\n<strong>Five
    years is a maddening amount of time to spend developing a single-weight typeface.
    Still, I'm pleased that <a href=\"http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0195\">Augustus</a>,
    my first commercially released font, is now available through <a href=\"http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0195\">YouWorkForThem</a>.</strong>\r\n\r\nThanks
    to the encouragement and eye of one Michael Cina, Augustus is now a complete international
    character set with a gang of whipped alternates. A half decade ago, however, it
    was 26 uppercase letters designed for a one-off poster. After hundreds of rounds
    of refinement, the rationalist that lives deep inside surfaced, and I developed
    a less flamboyant form for broader applications. It should be noted that this
    is no story of compromise. In the years since I began Augustus, the OpenType font
    format took hold, which enabled me to retain the original swash characters as
    stylistic alternates.\r\n\r\n<strong>A modern classic.</strong>\r\nAugustus is
    a hefty sans serif that combines classical humanist elements and precise geometry.
    With racehorses and typography, lineage is everything, and Augustus is from good
    stock. I\u2019ve paired the charisma of Morris Fuller Benton\u2019s Eagle Bold
    with the flair of Zuzana Licko\u2019s Dogma. The trained eye will detect a sprinkling
    of 19th century wood type in there as well.\r\n\r\nI named Augustus after Augustus
    Gloop, that alarming glutton of a child infamously expelled from the Chocolate
    Factory.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0195\">Download
