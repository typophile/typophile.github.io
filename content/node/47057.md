  but its not to look cheap, adventure show where he travels the world. Sort of like
  Indiana Jones meets a regular travel - see/learn about the locations- type of thing.\r\n\r\nI
  unfortunately keep relying on my old tried and trues. \r\n\r\nWondering if anyone
  had some suggestions that would spark something.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
