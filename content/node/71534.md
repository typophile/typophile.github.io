  A client of ours uses photos to create words... blah, blah, blah... but a big catalog
  company wishes to purchase said \"font.\" \r\nIs this even possible?\r\nAny help
  would be so, so, so much appreciated.\r\n\r\nSuzi"

  body: "You can use BitFonter from FontLab to create a photographic font that can
    be used in a few applications. But before you offer this to the client you should
    spend some time working with the sample photo fonts at photofont.com and try working
    in BitFonter. The Photofont plugin and BitFonter are mediocrities reminiscent
    of applications from the 1980s. Workflow is not fast and you\u2019ll end up doing
    a lot of support for users who want to know why they can\u2019t actually do decent
    typesetting with their expensive photo fonts. Unless somebody with deep pockets
    will commit to paying for the project on an hourly basis it probably is not worth
    it."
