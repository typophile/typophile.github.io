body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nWhich to use Fleischman BT or DTL Fleischmann?\r\n\r\nI presumed
  that the Dutch Type Library would be the best place to head for this. I know there
  are many more weights and optical sizes with DTL, but looking at the Bitstream version
  I also really like it. Can anyone give a strong reason to use one or the other?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    on whether you are using it for running text or display text, one might be more
    appropriate than the other."

      the foot serif in OsF's is quite common practice)"
