  body: Richard <BR> <BR>You may already know of him, but if not just type in Don
    Black Lineacasting and you will get his website and email address. Don is Toronto,
    and has one of the largest warehouses of letterpress stuff. I know that he is
    atill selling Ludlow stuff, so I would give him a try and see if he is intested.
    If you have matrices that are different from the North American stuff he may be
    interested. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer
