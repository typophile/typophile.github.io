  our font options.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for typefaces that are very readable at small
  sizes, have some emotion to them and don't feel too antiquated. Would love to know
  what recommendations the community at typophile would recommend for serif and sans
  serif typefaces. We also need to provide support for as many languages as possible.
  We're on ios, and android devices.\r\n\r\nLicensing is also very important. I'd
  prefer a type foundry that doesn't charge by how many downloads the app has, as
  it's pretty large.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"
