body: "I am looking for a tool (maybe software or a Web service) that can create subset
  of a given font containing glyphs for chosen characters only.\r\n\r\nAll the solutions
  known to me lack one crucial feature: they don\u2019t know anything about OpenType
  features (ligatures, figure styles, alternates etc.). I.e. if I request a subset
  containing \u201CABCabc123\u201D, the software creates a font with 9 glyphs\u2014without,
  for instance, small-caps for these letters or sub/superscript for these figures.
  Requesting a subset of \u201Cf\u201D and \u201Ci\u201D, I get no glyph for \u201Cfi\u201D
  ligature in resulting font, and so on.\r\n\r\nDo you know a tool that can subset
  font together with all OpenType features for chosen characters?"

    post. \r\n\r\n And also, if You request a subset containing \u201CABCabc123\u201D,
    and that's it, why should a subsetter include glyphs of features you did not request?
    I think subsetting tools are there to make the font smaller, so making decisions
    behind the user's back that make the font larger would be hard to use. Thus, smart
    subsetting tools require you to name the glyphs and/or the features you wish to
    be in the font, explicitly.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      this particular task: \u201Ctake these characters (Unicode characters, not glyphs!)

  body: "If you ask for a subset of 'f' and 'i', do you want just 'fi' and 'ffi' ligatures,
    or - \"ALL OpenType features related\" - the ligatures for 'fj' and 'ft' as well?
    Minding that regular software will *not* be able to access these characters, because
    you will not be able to use a 'j', since it's not in your font.\r\n\r\nAnd what
    about OpenType kerning? Do you want *every* character included that kerns against
    your chosen character?\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of your subset font?"

    body: "Theunis, thank you for the question.\r\n\r\nI am a Web developer and I
      want to speed up loading of font files on my websites. So it would be nice if,
      instead of bulk files with thousands of glyphs, files containing only the needed
      glyphs were provided by the server.\r\n\r\nCreating these font files manually
      is not an option, for website content changes constantly. Today, for example,
      an article with Greek letters could be added, and tomorrow it could be removed
      from the site, and Greek script glyphs will no longer be needed until the next
      time.\r\n\r\nOn my websites, OpenType features are extensively used, especially
      the ligatures, small capitals and figure styles (e.g. onum + pnum for inline
      numbers, but lnum + tnum in tables). Ideally, I would be satisfied with a tool
      that programmatically traverses all the content and, in some magic way, finds
      out what particular glyphs are needed to render all pages correctly, and then
      creates the subset of a font with these and only these glyphs.\r\n\r\nBut this
      solution would require too much black magic, so I am looking for something more
      simple. I can programmatically get the list of all codepoints currently used
      in site\u2019s content, and I wish the tool to find all glyphs that can correspond
      to these codepoints. I.e. if U+0031 DIGIT ONE is on the list, let the tool include
      all glyphs representing \u201C1\u201D into the resulting subset. Ideally, again,
      the \u201Cfi\u201D ligature glyph should be included only if \u201Cfi\u201D
      substring is found somewhere in the content, but it would be enough if the tool
      includes all ligatures for given letters. I.e. if U+0066 LATIN SMALL LETTER
      F is on the list, let the tool pick all ligatures containing \u201Cf\u201D (fi,
      fl, ffj etc.)."

  body: "I think it is pretty self-evident that if a client wants a specific characters
    subset, with related kerning and OT features, then the default delivery would
    be:\r\n- those characters, their variants, and ligatures whose inputs are *all*
    among the aforementioned glyphs\r\n- kerning for those pairs (and triplets etc)
    whose constituent glyphs are *all* in the newly defined subset\r\n\r\nOf course,
    one would verify that with the client, but that would be the obvious answer. Some
    of Theunis' suggestions seem deliberately twisted to me, but maybe it's just me.

  body: "Thomas, it's just exploring the OP's request to the fullest.\r\n\r\nSo, if
    I understand it correctly, for my example of \"f\", only the \"ff\" ligature and
    the kerning of \"f\" against itself ought to be included? And an additional \"i\"
    would add \"fi\", \"ffi\", and kerning for \"f\" against \"i\" and the reverse?"

      data. It is doing exactly as requested (IMO).
