body: "Thanks for your wisdom in advance. \r\n\r\nI am wondering what these three
  fonts are. There is a standard serif font in red and a display font in white (has
  tiny horizontal lines in the heavy areas of the letters). \r\n\r\nAlso, there is
  a handwritten font in white-any thoughts? I know that the bride found this as a
  font...so it is somewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    and blurry for me... it could be Times New Roman Bold but /T looks different...\r\nIt
    could really help if you post a better (larger and not so blurry) picture of this
    one."

  body: "Chevalier was designed by Emil Alfred Neukomm for Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei
    in M\xFCnchenstein, Switzerland in 1946. Named after the French actor Maurice
    Chevalier. Softmaker cloned it as Maurice. Legitimate versions, as cited above,
    by Linotype, Letter Perfect and URW +++. There was also a Berthold version, which
    seems not to be currently available.\r\nDon"
