  I just finished adding the pre-critique touches, and I'd like your professional
  opinions.\r\n\r\n{Garamond Premiere Pro : Regular (Small Caps) / Italic Caption

  body: "My first reaction was, \"Wow, I didn't expect something called 'Town Center
    Wine & Spirits' to have such a nice logo!\"   A minute later, I do have some criticisms:\r\n\r\nThe
    whole thing seems a bit too wide - the \"Town\" and \"Center\" bugs me for being
    so loosely tracked.  The wine bottle seems pixelated on the edge, and the white
    label flattens it out unpleasantly - perhaps get rid of the label or making it
    20% transparency?  The sections of type below could both move a bit towards the
    grape vine, allowing the town and center to have slightly tighter spacing without
    ruining the balance.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: It would make a good upper banner on a web site, but I'd need to see it in
    use to judge it as a label.

  body: "Before discussing the logo design itself, I suggest you print this out on
    a business card and many problems will reveal themselves. There are many, many
    issues with the complexities of this design for a logo, and a small business will
    not appreciate how expensive this logo will become to reproduce legibly, if they
    can reproduce it at all. \r\nHere it is at three inches long:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Town-Center-3inches_3808.jpg]"

  body: ^ start in black & white, and look at it small. The spacing on town should
    better match center. Maybe grape leaves and vine could be simplified to work in
    the same way and still read at a smaller size. The text at the bottom should be
    optional and maybe not part of the mark development.

  body: "Thanks, everyone.\r\n\r\nJB, the text is definitely not to be part of the
    logotype. It's something that the client requested, but I think it will only be
    used at legible sizes, i.e. on their site, signs, shirts, etc.\r\n\r\nThe whole
    thing started in black (how I usually approach logo development). The shading,
    etc, came about after a suitable black version.\r\n\r\nThanks for the reminders
    to look at it small."

    that?

  body: It looks like a MA shop for sure! I think it is hugely nice. But not distinctive
    enough. So it might not be memorable enough. This far in though, I can't imagine
    it's time for a whole new concept. If it was me I would look for a way to tie
    up the elements that would meet these two demands.

  body: "Kerning suggestions: What if you had a bit more space was between the O &
    W in Town to make the spacing more like the word Center. Pull the N & E slightly
    closer to the T in center.\r\n\r\nWhat if the a in Massachusetts was a bit closer
    to the M.\r\n\r\nThe shade on the label was a very very good idea."

    full color all together. Nice work!\r\n\r\nMinor nitpick: I'd really like the
    label on the bottle aligned with the x-height of the type. Right now, it's a tad
    low."
