  so, I was on a website earlier & saw this phrase as a picture image in a font I
  fell in love with that would be perfect for my next typography project, I just have
  no idea what it is. I have googled & done a few 'identify a font' sites that scanned
  images or asked questions about the details. Honestly, I thought this would be a
  5 second process, it just seems like it'd be well known...Anyone?"
