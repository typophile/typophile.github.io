  body: "yes guillemets I wrote this about 1997-99\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/punc.aspx\r\n\r\nGuillemets\r\n\r\nThese
    quotation marks commonly called 'French quotes' or 'duck's feet' are said to have
    been named after a French typecutter Guillaume (William) Le B\xE9. Guillemets
    is the French word for quotation marks. The similarly named Guillemot is a narrow
    billed, sea auk with duck like feet found in cold northern regions of the world.\r\n\r\nThese
    pointing quotation marks are used in many languages and point differently dependent
    on the language. The German language uses these quotation marks with the right
    pointing guillemets as the open quotation marks and the left pointing guillemts
    as the close quotation marks. In French typography the left pointing quillemets
    are used as the open quotation marks and the right pointing quillemets are the
    closing quotation marks.\r\n\r\nTraditionally in French typography the left pointing
    guillemets are followed by a non-breaking word space or thin space of 1/8 the
    em and the right proceeded by a non-breaking word space or thin space of 1/8 the
    em.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Single left pointing quillemet\r\n      Unicode: U+2039\r\n\r\n
    \     Advance width rule : This character's advance width is proportional and
    the same as the single right pointing guillemet.\r\n\r\n      Height alignment
    : This character aligns on the lowercase x-height at the same vertical height
    as the single right guillemet. \r\n\r\n\r\n    * Single right pointing quillemet\r\n
    \     Unicode: U+203a\r\n\r\n      Advance width rule : This character's advance
    width is proportional and the same as the single left pointing guillemet.\r\n\r\n
    \     Height alignment : This character aligns on the lowercase x-height at the
    same vertical height as the single left pointing guillemet. \r\n\r\n\r\n    *
    Left pointing quillemets - guillemet ouvrant\r\n      Unicode: U+00ab\r\n\r\n
    \     Advance width rule : This character's advance width is proportional and
    the same as the right pointing guillemets.\r\n\r\n      Height alignment : This
    character aligns on the lowercase x-height with the same vertical alignment as
    the right pointing guillemets. \r\n\r\n\r\n    * Right pointing quillemets - guillemet
    fermant\r\n      Unicode: U+00bb\r\n\r\n      Advance width rule : This character's
    advance width is proportional and the same as the left pointing guillemets.\r\n\r\n
    \     Height alignment : This character aligns on the lowercase x-height with
    the same vertical alignment as the left pointing guillemets.\r\n\r\n      Language
    note : In French typographic usage the left pointing guillemet - guillemet ourvant
    is followed by a non-breaking word space (espace mots ins\xE9cable) and the right
    pointing guillemet - guillemet fermant is preceded by a non-breaking word space.
    In Microsoft Word 97 the non-breaking space U+00A0 is automatically inserted when
    the French language is selected and a guillemet is typed. Some French typographers
    prefer to use a non-breaking thin space (espace fine ins\xE9cable) with the guillemets.\r\n\r\nVincent

    in French typography the left pointing guillemets are followed by a non-breaking
    word space or thin space of 1/8 the em and the right proceeded by a non-breaking
    word space or thin space of 1/8 the em.\"\r\n\r\nIf your question refers to this,
    fear not: those spaces are added by the typesetter, not the typeface designer.
    If you are asking about something else, just ignore this comment.  :-)"

    it is. If you are worried about how well your eye judges this black/white balance,
    try setting a sample text in InDesign using various good fonts (Adobe fonts, FSI
    fonts, other favorites you might have\u2026). Grab French and German text from
    Google News or any other favorite source. Replace the quote marks yourself, or
    let InDesign do it for you (it should switch them automatically if you change
    the text's language to French, for instance). See how text set in these fonts
    look. Make print-outs. Compare with the same text set in your font. Then you will
    see. It isn't so hard; you just have to trust you eyes and your intuition."
