  a typeface similar to this one...\r\n\r\nIt's a typefaqce called PS Fovea by a designer
  named Mark Caneso, and it isn't released yet so I thought I would see if anyone
  had any suggestions on some similar fonts that are currently available.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\njosh"

  body: "It's an odd mix of many different things so it's tough to find recommendation
    for you. It will help of you tell us more about what you like in Fovea.\r\n\r\nSome
    of its serifs are like those mentioned above, but it's skeleton is more <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_milo_serif_ot_medium/\">FF
    Milo</a>."

  body: FF Milo is nice Stephen but the x height seems really tall (maybe it's just
    me, but the caps seem really small when paired with lower case letters, i guess
    for legibility?), I guess it's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what i like about
    Fovea. Let me think about it i guess. Thanks for the help!!!

  body: "BTW, have you contacted Mark Caneso? You might try to convince him to sell
    you a \"beta\" version of Fovea. You could pay full price but be entitled to the
    final version upon completion. And Mark might appreciate the feedback from real-world
    usage, which would help improve the final product. I've actually done this myself
    as a type designer.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
