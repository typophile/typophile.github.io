  body: 'It would be somewhat difficult to achieve that level of hinting using anything
    other than VTT (ie would be hard using FontLab) and VTT has a steep learning curve.
    You might be best off sub-contracting the hinting out so someone with VTT experience.
    If they have an autohinter that gets them part-way there, then the cost may not
    be prohibitive, compared to the hrs you might have to spend. '

    there's no reason why an older version could be used to apply light hints. Please
    contact me off-list and we'll get latest public version of VTT to you.\r\n\r\n>Who
    is known to have a CT autohinter?\r\n\r\nNot sure if the owners would consider
    that NDA. So I'll answer many of \"the usual suspects\" associated with hinting
    TrueType.\r\n"

  body: 'regular hinting will help. In looking at your Maral font for instance, I
    think regular TrueType hinting to control the y features, y rounds, heights, ascenders,
    descenders, etc, you would get good results. Once you are up to speed with the
    VTT Visual hinting interface, the hinting can be quite fast. It is also easy to
    proof the font as you go. both in VTT itself, and by installing the font on either
    XP or Vista. Once hinted I dont see why it wont work well for all sizes. '

  body: "The hinting in Corbel is actually very light, and probably reproducable with
    FontLab. You would only need VTT if you wanted to access some new link types that
    so far, to my knowledge, no shipping fonts use, or if you wanted to include flags
    to turn on x-direction delta controls. You can certainly do more with VTT than
    you can with FontLab, but you probably don't need to.\r\n\r\nThe basic thing about
    CT to remember is that the y-direction is handled much as it was with b/w and
    greyscale antialiasing, while the x-direction is largely hint-independent in most
    fonts (i.e. x-direction deltas are inhibited, and a font without even x-direction
    links may look better than one with them, depending on the design). This has an
    impact on design, because it means that obtaining harmonised weight relationships
    between horizontal and vertical elements requires different approaches: x-direction
    weight needs to be controlled via the outline, while y-direction weight can be
    controlled with hints. [This is the heart of David Berlow's complaint against
    CT.] The biggest problem arising from this in a typical font is that there will
    be some ppem sizes at which it is impossible to harmonise x- and y-direction heights,
    i.e. where the y-direction stems jump a full pixel while the x-direction is gaining
    weight more gradually. This will be especially obvious in glyphs with rotated
    ductus, e.g. in the lower bowl of a Latin roman g, which will stand out from other
    glyphs at some sizes.\r\n\r\nSo my advice would be to try to identify the common
    range of ppem sizes (taking into account nominal point sizes and device resolutions)
    at which the Armenian type is likely to be used by the client. Then try to tailor
    the design to avoid as far as possible weight problems due to y-direction pixel
    jumps within this range (keeping in mind that you do have control via hinting
    of when those jumps happen). I would also go through the Armenian glyph set and
    identify potential problem shapes."

  body: PS. I think the term 'CT hinting' is misleading, since this can refer to two
    very different things. It is used to refer to a particular hinting <em>strategy</em>
    employing very light hinting with an emphasis on y-direction alignment control
    and very little x-direction hints, as used in the MS CT font collection. But it
    could also be used, perhaps more accurately, to refer to what I would characterise
    as subpixel painting with hints, akin to the use of hints to affect greyscale
    rendering. To my knowledge, no one is actually doing this kind of hinting -- it
    requires special flags in the hint program to (re)activate x-direction deltas
    --, which may explain why the term is commonly used in the first sense.

  body: In the original pass on the CT font collection, Mike's idea was to not employ
    any x-direction hints at all, which would have left basically y- alignment control,
    y- stem weights and very occasional y- deltas (considering that the x-direction
    resolution gain reduces or eliminates the need for deltas in curve transitions
    between y- and x-direction stems). For sure, there are things one can do in VTT,
    if one is a 'super star hinter', in the prep program for example, that are not
    accessible in FontLab. But I doubt if Hrant would be wanting to do such things
    anyway; I suppose it depends how demanding his clients are and what they mean
    by 'renders well under ClearType'.
