body: "Hi all you typelovers.\r\n\r\nWell i'm having a strange problem.\r\nAt work
  we used to work with the .ttf Parisine (from Porchez).\r\nI bought last year the
  .otf version and from this day on i'm having strange problems.\r\nThere i go:\r\n\r\nFirst,
  i'm working on a 2ghz Core Duo Intel iMac with Mac OSX.4.8.\r\nI removed the .ttf
  Parisine, so there is just one Parisine active and this is the .otf\r\n\r\nWhat
  happens is that, let's say i worked on a catalogue, text is set in Parisine .otf,
  everything's fine...\r\nThen the next day, i open up my document to continue and
  the text is full of ligatures that i did not want and were not there befor.\r\nEverywhere
  the ct and st ligatures and on top of this all the dubble o's like in \"books\"
  are replaced by a ? in a square.\r\nHmm does anybody had this befor?\r\nEven if
  i select all the text and uncheck the ligature option in the characters palette
  nothing changes.\r\nSometimes i just close the document and Indesign and just reopen
  it and everything is fine again but that works like 1/20.\r\n\r\nAlso i'm not the
  only one having this problem here at work.\r\n\r\nWhere can this come from? \r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot for any help,\r\n\r\nGilles"

  body: "Village is doing a good suggestion to contact us directly.\r\n\r\nBut, the
    main problem I see behind this cache problem, is that Mr \"Butter\" is not on
    our list of client for Parisine PTF (OpenType version).\r\n\r\nSo, we perhaps
    don't fill out correctly our databases of sales, on this case, it can be good
    if Mr \"Butter\" can help on that.\r\n\r\nThen, we will be happy to sorted out
    the problem, what ever it is.\r\n\r\nPS. We never sell any TrueType versions of
    any retail fonts, so Parisine in TTF is a stranger for us\u2026"

  body: I got the same problem with different typefaces, so the problem does not com
    from Parisine. I have posted about it on the Adobe forums and the InDesign Talk
    list. Throwing away font caches did not solve it. At this day, the ONLY way was
    to discard the user account and to recreate it.
