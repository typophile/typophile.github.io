  body: The Cochin carried by Adobe for years should always have had oldstyle figures
    but was digitized early on without. The pre-digital version did include oldstyle
    figures somewhere in its original design program, but OSFs were just blown off
    in early conversions. Why the license holder can't go back and fix that, I cannot
    imagine. Guardi is another Renaissance-feel face that obviously needs oldstyle
    figures--probably the reason it is not more popular, because otherwise it's excellent.
    This is one of the continuing scandals in our field today, something that should
    be solved as an industry-wide standard, along with the problem of families released
    without bold and/or bold italic, or families whose fonts cannot be keystroke-linked.

    well with l.c. letters. \r\n\r\nThe top line shows what 'should' be done to prepare

    and a less exuberant Y. \r\n\r\nI don't know when this will be done, or when it

  body: "dberlow, most new text families with any kind of antique look (and many with
    very modern looks) are being designed with oldstyle figures now as a matter of
    course, reflecting the enormous demand for them, so this priority is nothing new
    to young type designers. \r\n\r\nWhen ITC published their series of sample books
    in the 1970s and 80s for new text families, these books showed that many had oldstyle
    figures designed and available for all the fonts, but most OSFs were not converted
    to digital in the 1990s. ITC is now moving, family by family, to put OSFs fully
    into play in OpenType, where they are most easily accessed. Via ITC, Galliard
    finally has OSFs for every single font--while Adobe's OpenType Galliard still
    has none. I suspect pre-digital Cochin also had OSFs designed, so they just would
    need to be digitized.\r\n\r\nI certainly agree that crude kerning should be added
    to our hit list of industry-wide reforms. Why can't somebody show some industry
    leadership on these issues? "

  body: "<cite> &gt; I suspect pre-digital Cochin also had OSFs designed, so they
    just would need to be digitized.</cite>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, John, this suspicion
    is unfounded. \r\n\r\nAccording to Mac McGrew: \"Cochin originated with the Peignot
    Foundry of Paris, about 1915. . . . Sol Hess adapted it to the Monotype in 1917,
    while ATF copied the French face in 1925. Both Monotype and ATF replaced the French
    figures with the more usual lining figures.\" \r\n\r\nSo more than mere digitization
    would be required; it would take someone to design them. (Note: French figures
    are not quite the same as oldstyle figures and would be probably even less acceptable
    to 21st century taste than lining figures.)\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it couldn't
    or shouldn't be done. It's just that it would take more work/investment than one
    might initially suspect (as is often the case, unfortunately).\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    they would have to do is replace their worthless Galliard by licensing the new
    ITC version, and thus make more money on it than ever, because--vee-oh-lah--OSFs
    for every font, at long last!! Strangely, even the 1970s pre-digital Galliard
    offered OSFs only for two of the fonts in that large family...I guess Carter felt
    OSFs were only good for stationery back then...he certainly changed his tune later,
    as we see whenever we post using his Georgia! '

    Adobe, they make $20. (Or whatever, I don't know the numbers.)\r\n\r\nHence, if
    I recall what I have read somewhere else, it's not Adobe that isn't willing to
    osf all of their licensed typefaces, it's ITC who isn't willing.\r\n\r\nLooking

  body: "Kent is right about the lack of osf in Monotype Cochin. None of the Monotype
    shops I worked in/with ever had them; they weren't available.\r\n\r\nThis comment
    by Kent is also true:\r\n\"(Note: French figures are not quite the same as oldstyle
    figures and would be probably even less acceptable to 21st century taste than
    lining figures.)\"\r\n\r\nI proofread a book back in the mid-1980s that had been
    designed in Cochin by one of the best book designers on the West Coast. He used
    the Nicholas Cochin figures, which to me are the \"French figures\" to which Kent
    refers. They looked outlandish along with Cochin text. I had to go head-to-head
    with the designer to get them out of there. I cannot recall what we ended up using.
    It would be very hard to substitute osf from any other face into Cochin and have
    them look right. & very time-consuming to draw them new for a face that probaly
    is not near the top of any font best-seller lists.\r\n\r\nI think it a bit far-fetched
    to say consumers have \"every right\" to expect such things as osf. Consumers
    have every right to expect cars with gas tanks that won't explode, baby clothing
    that will not roast the infants, software that won't screw up our machines, and
    otherwise healthful and safe products. But osf hardly falls into the category
    of what we have every right to expect. As users of fonts/faces, we have every
    right to not use faces/fonts that haven't got what we need, at the possible fiscal
    peril of the seller. Lack of osf hardly rises to the level of \"scandal.\" \r\n\r\nI'm
    hard-pressed to imagine a job for which Cochin is the only face that will work.
