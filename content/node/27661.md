body: "Hello all, \r\nI work for a newspaper publishing company. \r\nMy team is having
  a rough time getting new fonts imported into an old PC-based desktop publishing
  pagination system, Good News (GN3) built by Tera. The Tera people are working on
  the issue but haven't found a solution. I've been told the fonts need to run through
  Fontographer before they work but our IT Director can't get them to display on screen
  or print. The fonts are the Mercury family from Hoefler & Frere-Jones. H&FJ say
  the fonts have worked for others with similar systems. We can get their Whitney
  font to work just fine.\r\n\r\nAny insight into this or similar problems with using
  fonts in pagination systems would be great. I love this font and would hate to see
  us miss the opportunity to use it. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n-Kris"
