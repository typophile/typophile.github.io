  about paring fonts. My text body is Minion Pro and I am looking for the perfect
  couple for headlines, I am looking for both serif and sans-serif for headlines.
  What would you recommend?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "For serif headlines I would recommend Minion Pro (in a heavier weight).\r\nFor
    sans-serif headers anything but what goes along the lines of Helvetica / Akzidenz
    Grotesk. \r\n\r\nIMHO font matching is not about finding the(TM) perfect couple
    but about avoiding crude mismatches. Headline fonts should primarily be chosen
    according to the character of the publication (contents, media, target group),
    of which you tell nothing. I always thought Curlz MT goes well with Minion, I
    mean for certain purposes. But that's not exactly a sans-serif.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

    sure to get a \"display\" cut, as those are specifically designed for use at headline
    sizes.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Minion is pretty neutral, I would chose a contrasting face based on the subject
    matter/content of your publication. Most of the well-known sans-serifs would work
    well - Gotham, Myriad, Futura, Helvetica, Meta, Univers, Frutiger, Franklin Gothic,
    etc.
