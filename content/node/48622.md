    Semibold has very similar quotation marks. One thing to note is that these marks
    are actually backwards, as your sample shows them, because the open quote looks
    like a pair of 6's, while the closed quote looks like a pair of 9's. Your sample
    uses backward 9's, which I believe is incorrect.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
