body: "Of the four newspapers that won this year's Society for News Design award,
  I've only managed to find a copy of one (The Guardian) and I'm hoping for help from
  the kind font freaks of the world. The three in question are:\r\n\r\nAkzia (Moscow)\r\nExpresso
  (Paco de Arcos, Portugal)\r\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\r\n\r\nThe last
  one isn't very exotic (unless \"Sonntagszeitung\" means something strange - perhaps
  just \"Sunday edition\"?) but Newseum.org hasn't shown front pages from any of them
  since I started looking (and they're also very lousy at returning emails and phone
  calls).\r\n\r\nOf course I would be more than happy to barter something of -supposed-
  value with anybody willing/able to mail me an issue of one of those three.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to Expresso through the Yale University Library's newspaper room. I could almost
    certainly make some scans of an issue if that would be helpful, and I could see
    about whether I could acquire an old issue. I wouldn't be able to do that for
    at least a week, though, but let me know if nothing else materializes.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    And, yes, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung is the Sunday edition AFAIK,
    looking significantly different (less conservative) from the other days."

  body: "Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nThe Expresso site that Miguel points out seems to give
    a great idea of the paper, although I couldn't figure out how to register* to
    get a PDF. Miguel, I would gladly Paypal you the mailing cost if you'd be willing
    to make that generous effort; January would be better than never, but too late
    for a project I'm working on. Reed, if Miguel does have to wait until January
    then I would certainly highly appreciate the following two scans: medium-res of
    a typical inside page, and max-res of a few lines of typical text. And if you
    can swing an actual back issue, that would rule.\r\n\r\n* My Castillian doesn't
    unlock Portuguese, contrary to what I assumed when I was learning Castillian...\r\n\r\nUli,
    thanks much for that. BTW, are they no longer using Gulliver? (Or am I mixing
    up Frankfurter Allgemeine with another German paper?) Also, if anybody would be
    willing to snailmail me a copy of the Sunday Edition that would be very nice (and
    deserving of reciprocation).\r\n\r\nSo, what about the elusive Akzia...\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW,

    then (and you remind me\u2026), I can send you a copy once I'm resettled in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nI
    think that you are confusing the FAZ's Sunday Edition with the <em>Stuttgarter
    Zeiting</em>. The <em>Stuttgarter Zeitung</em> uses Guilliver.* The <em>Frankfurter
    Allgemeine</em> uses Times Ten, AFAIK.\r\n\r\n* During a lecture earlier in the
    year at Reading, Gerard showed us <em>USA Today</em> and the <em>Stuttgarter Zeiting</em>.
    Both use Gulliver, but you won't think it just by glancing at the two papers together,
    because they both use the typeface in such completely different ways."
