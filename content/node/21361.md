  design that incoporate a lot of text.  I've done a lot of minimal design but I've
  never quite gotten the hang of dealing with text for the web.\r\n\r\nHere is the
  site\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.gordonbasichis.com/index.html\">http://www.gordonbasichis.com/index.html</a>\r\n\r\nI
  really appreciate it.  I'm not much of designer these days but I really want to
  do a decent job for him.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCasey"

    and <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/\">Speak Up</a> for inspiration.
    The important thing is too have a clear hierarchy of information and present the
    text in web digestable bits that the user can navigate into and possibly provide
    a simple printable version if desired.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the tips.  I just recently bought the three type books reccomended
    on this site.  I do wish there was a greater focus on the aesthetics of page layout
    though.\r\n\r\nIt occured to me that the latter two are designed with a greater
    concern for updatability and flexibility than for the sheer amount of text.\r\n\r\nAny
    good examples of sites with non generated layout, interesting design and ample
    text\r\n\r\nAlso.  Long, long ago, when I did web dev professionally at a firm,
    they insisted that everything be comped in photoshop before going to code... for
    work like this do you all follow this rule?  Should I be planning this out in
    something like indesign?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "I would probably start with indesign in this case. First get all the text
    in there and then play around with the general layout. Make a couple of different
    layouts and compare them. after you are happy with the text layout you can get
    ps in there (or illustrator or flash..whatever you use) to add navigational items.
    But I think it's most important to have a clear view of the plain text first before
    being distracted by images and things.\r\ndav.\r\n\r\nNone are so hopelessly enslaved
    as those who falsely believe they are free.\r\n-Goethe-"

    see that they rely on strong grid systems in their layouts; this helps to manage
    any size/length of text that they post. Clean designs both, the text is the focal
    point with the \"design\" receding into a structural background."
