  similar to century gothic but notice the difference in the top of the lower case
  \"a\" and the center peak of the lower case \"w\", as well as the T-intersection
  in the upper \"K\" and \"R\"\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, very close. Still the lower case \"w\" does not match, also, for the
    first time, I see that the lower case \"u\" has a tail. Any other guesses?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonty

  body: the "w" is two "v"s overlapped, the "u" with stem is from the regular version
    of Bryant and the ascenders on the lowercase have been decapitated (look at the
    top of the b and t in "about", they shouldn't be even on top).

  body: Yeah, the strikingly different widths of the capitals might arguably be likely
    customized, but no way anyone would bother to change the /s/ like that.
