    companies like magazine companies have been using Quark for years, as it has been
    the industry standard. All of their archives and templates are in Quark. Although
    we as individuals and small design firms realize the superiority of InDesign,
    it is impossible for larger companies to just drop everything 'Quark' and change
    to a new format.\r\n\r\nThese are interesting statistics though. I wonder what
    Quark 7 will do to this."

      this, but for some reason the survey didn't originally include data for the
      different versions of InDesign.\r\n\r\nHowever, I suspect that most users who
      have switched to InDesign (or have always only used it) would have bought it
      as part of the CS package, either 1 or 2. It's hard to believe that a large
      amount of people would still be using InDesign 1 or 2 successfully.\r\n\r\n---\r\n"

    Come to think about it, the whole 6% is probably in the margin of error, one way

    \"Quark still No. 1 for Canadian magazines\" makes sense if your default assumption
    was that InDesign has dethroned Quark in the installed base. Since that wasn't
    my assumption, wearing my Adobe hat I was heartened rather than dismayed by the
    stats.\r\n\r\n2003: QXP 84%, InD 11%\r\n2006: QXP 53%, InD 38%\r\n\r\nSo QuarkXPress
    has lost over a third of their market share (of the installed base), while InDesign
    has gone up by 3.5x.\r\n\r\nLooking deeper at the numbers, of the 46% of the market
    that was on QXP 4 and 5, and moved, 15/46 went to newer versions of Quark, and
    27/46 went to InDesign, meaning that of Canadian magazines implementing newer
    DTP software in those three years, over 60% moved from Quark to InDesign rather
    than upgrading QuarkXPress.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    while InDesign is coming on strong, although I didn't have figures to confirm
    which was ahead. So I thought it would be interesting to post this data.\r\n\r\nAs
    a corollary, older operating systems are still much in use as well. At a presentation
    of Tiger and CS2, at the Toronto Type Club last Fall, the audience was asked which
    Apple OS they were using, and there was a split between the various OS X beasts,
    and pre-OS X."

    to see these survey results in 2007.\r\n\r\nWe switched to InDesign about two
    years ago, but many of our sister publications have continued with Quark. The
    reason? InDesign's hardware requirements. Moving 200+ staff from OS9 iMacs running
    Quark 4 to OSX capable hardware has proven to be a multi-hundred-thousand dollar
    investment.\r\n\r\nStill, over the past two years, computers have been upgraded
    piecemeal, and now any publication that has the means has moved to InDesign. I
    think the plan is to have all 15 of our magazines over to InDesign by the end
    of the 2006 calendar year.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if anyone's reading these stats
    as a lack of willingness to move to InDesign -- it's quite the opposite. Anyone
    here who's not using InDesign is chomping at the bit to rid themselves of Quark."

    Their headline for the software part of the survey results? \"Adobe, Microsoft,
    Quark are the 3 Kings.\"\r\n\r\nThe survey had 67 responses from production managers
    responsible for 171 magazines altogether. Statistics Canada says there are 2383
    magazines published in Canada, so that's about 7% of the total magazines. If it
    were a ransome sample, that would be enough to be pretty representative, but of
    course it's not. Hard to say just how representative it is.\r\n\r\nSome of the
    other stats from the same survey were interesting. For example...\r\n\r\n2003:
    10% on OS X, 48% more planned to adopt within 12 months.\r\n2006: 82% on OS X,
    11% more plan to adopt within 12 months.\r\n\r\nAd files submission:\r\n\r\n2003:
    42% app file, 6% \"Wacko & other,\" 30% PDF (28% X-1a, 2% regular), 11% PostScript/EPS,
    8% TIFF-IT, 2% film\r\n\r\n2006: 17% app file, 19% \"Wacko & other,\" 40% PDF
    (18% X-1a, 22% regular), 14% PostScript/EPS, 7% TIFF-IT, 3% film\r\n\r\n\"Wacko
    & other\" is a category that includes taking PowerPoint, Word and other odd (for
    publishing) file formats. I was surprised to see the growth there, but I guess
    it means that people are being more responsive to customer demands. Interesting
    to see the 25% decrease in app file usage but only a 10% increase in PDF.\r\n\r\nProofing
    takes many forms, but the single most common approach? None, at 23% (up from 18%).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

    but to me, Quark is  easier to navigate with its box implementation. Misleading
    too, is the CS concept. If I buy Quark, I'm going to use it, if I buy CS2, i may
    only use three, and choose to use Quark and Dreamweaver.  Adobe, clever marketing
    folks they are, do not tell us how many are using IDCS2. \r\n\r\nI have worked
    in several types (digital, label and presently offset) of print shops in the last
    8 years and ID has made small inroads, but really and sadly Pagemaker has a larger
    page and user base, and combined they lag behind Quark by miles I think Adobe
    was so optimistic about dethroning Quark 7 years ago that they must be pulling
    their hair out and only getting such a small return. 7 years which is interesting,
    because I think that is how long Quark 3.xx was out and the industry learned everthing
    about the program and that gives Quark a mighty lead.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRodrigue
