body: Please help!  Are there any rules or formatting structures for using swashes
  to fill in negative space for a scrip or brush layout?  Like are there any tips
  or do-and-don'ts of creation?  I want to use some to add to my layout but i don't
  know where to begin or which ones to use if the font does not contain alternates
  or glyphs included in the original.  Thanks in advance!
