body: "hey there,\r\n\r\ni hope someone can help me out with the id of this 70's helvetica
  based (i think) typeface. it's the bits written in the center (SKUNK) and top left
  the band's name (DOE MAAR). any help is appreciated a lot. thanks in advance.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nrabattski\r\n\r\nps.
  this record isn't from the 70's in case you wondered. i've seen this typeface before
  earlier, such as the fuck off/on the crest album from the electric chairs etc."

  body: I know there are plenty of knockoffs of this face, but I don't know what the
    official name is, so I'm gonna let someone else handle this one..

  body: i thought that as well initially but i have three samples, this one (mid 80's),
    an album sample from the electric chairs ('78) and a t-shirt from the briefs (2005)
    all three use the exact same typeface. could be coincident though. hope someone
    knows (must be).
