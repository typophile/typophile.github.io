  body: "This looks like an amateur effort, similar to what I've seen on many scrapbooking
    sites. I checked the MyFonts for commercial fonts that  might be close enough
    to simulate this and came up with <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/grandma/\">Grandma</a>
    and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/happy/\">Happy</a>.\r\n\r\nYou
    might also search Dafont for free hand-lettered fonts. For example, Nick Curtis's
    <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/boyzrgross.font?text=Prince\">BoyzRGross</a> is
    pretty similar in feel. Guessing the categories to search is part of the problem
    though.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
