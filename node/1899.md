body: Can anyone recommend a text typeface &#40;Mac &amp;PC&#41; which will be used
  alongside a coroprate logo. The logo is a bit futura / 20&#39;s deco inspired. Futura
  itself is no good as it looks awful when loads of copy is set. Any thoughts anyone?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot <BR> <BR>Ged

    family? I bit more modern, but lots of flexibility for heads and body text.

    <BR>One thought is that sometimes you don&#39;t want a typeface that looks &#42;similar&#42;
    to the logotype, because if it&#39;s obviously not the same it makes it look as
    if you just couldn&#39;t match it. If you think sans serif is still what you want,
    then pick a sans style that doesn&#39;t resemble your logo. <BR>That&#39;s my
    two cents.

    Well, actually my two eurocents are worth  <BR>2.31350 dollarcents, but let&#39;s
    not get nitpicky here. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>P.S. Neutraface Text works wonderfully well:
    I&#39;m  <BR>currently setting a congress book in Neutraface  <BR>and Aurora,
    and the fun part is when you start  <BR>combining NeutraText Book &#40;Avenir-mode&#41;
    with  <BR>NeutraText Alt Bold &#40;Futura-mode&#41;. Brilliant stuff. <BR> <BR>But
    Grant I must agree that Paralucent is a beauty  <BR>&#40;though a bit pricey&#41;.'
