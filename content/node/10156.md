    fine book. I have it too. Cut out several pages and <BR>hung them on my walls.

  body: 'That exact specimen is also in Rob Roy Kelly&#39;s &#34;American Wood Type:
    1828-1900&#34; first published in 1969. The caption &#40;not included in the ABZ
    book&#41; reads: <BR> <BR>&#34;Gothic Extended. This particular cutting made by
    the Hamilton Company after 1900. Lowercase is missing.&#34; <BR> <BR>Wood type
    Gothics like this go back to the 1840s or earlier.'

    by David Berlow, may be another nice and rather close digitisation.. <BR><i>&#40;

  body: Thanks all! <BR>Stephen it&#39;s a very nice book. Some very nice modular
    typefaces also. <BR>Mark thanks for the information. It&#39;s good to hear it&#39;s
    cut after 1900 because I named my version after Al Capone. So the period was right.
    <BR>Dav thanks for the other interpretations based on the same typeface. I think
    Rhode isn&#39;t based on the same typefase but it&#39;s very nice. <BR>Thanks
    all!

  body: It is a nice book, but having all the references at the back of the book is
    such a pain. I was looking at the same font last night I believe it said it was
    produced in 1837 &#40;it was late, so I might be mistaken&#41; apart from the
    S and ampersand it is quite attractive. <BR>Tim
