body: "I started out using Helvetica as a titling type, but it looks just a little
  too sterile and clean cut. Looking around for something more soft, I came across
  [[http://www.dafont.com/alte-haas-grotesk.font|Alte Haas Grotesk]] which looked
  better. Alas, it has no italic or small caps.\r\n\r\nThe [[http://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/features/|Neue
  Haas Grotesk]] does have an italic (oblique) but still no small caps. It's not quite
  as rounded either, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nNow I'm looking for something like Alte
  Haas Grotesk but with italic and with small caps. Any recommendations? [[http://www.tipografies.com/fonts/bulo-rounded/styles/|Bulo
  Rounded]] perhaps?\r\n\r\nThanks :)"

    a slightly heavier weight at a reduced size to work around the lack of smallcaps?

  body: "Yes, \u201Cfaux\u201D small caps can be used, styled with: (1) a minute amount
    of stroke, (2) tracked out slightly, and (3) a touch of horizontal scaling. It\u2019s
    possible to play around with these parameters, as well as (4) height, till one
    achieves a satisfactory effect."

  body: "Oh sorry, my bad :) This is for a scientific publication, and thus some seriousness
    and authority is needed; but it's on children's psychology with lots of children's
    illustrations so the type shouldn't be too cold. That's why I liked the rounded
    Alte Haas...\r\n\r\n<strong>Nick</strong>, in that context Figgins Sans might
    be too artsy and playful. But I quite like it!"
