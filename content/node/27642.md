  body: "I'm sorry, you're not talking about Latinized type, but the other way around.\r\n\r\nTo
    me that's a lot less bad than Latinized type, but it simply looks cheesy (classier
    term: naive) almost all the time. If you'd like to exhibit some cultural cross-pollination
    in type, you need to be very subtle (like in this case you might use a Latin font
    with reverse stroke contrast, a really nice one being FF Balance). Unfortunately,
    subtlety tends to be a lost cause among most people these days... especially among
    those who insist on not paying for fonts.  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
