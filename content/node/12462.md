  1988. It is a typeface based on [[Futura]], which was designed during the 1920s
  by [[Paul Renner]]. Frutiger had never been bappy with the cold, modern appearance
  of Futura, so he \"humanized\" it. \r\n\r\nAvenir has no true [[italic]] styles
  were made though, just [[oblique]] ones. This seems in keeping with most of Frutiger's
  other typefaces. Avenir also has no small caps, oldstyle figure, or condensed styles.
  These three features may be found in the 2004 redesign of Avenir that was produced
  by Frutiger and [[Akira Kobayashi]], [[Avenir Next]].\r\n\r\nHere is the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html\">URL
