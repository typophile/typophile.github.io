    body: "<cite>mondob: Shift+4 does not work on US keyboards.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's
      where the dollar sign is on US keyboards, so it stands to reason one wouldn't
      find the euro mark there.\r\n\r\n(note: My previous comment is edited because
      currency and euro have different unicode numbers, and are now so noted.)"

  body: Option-shift-2 was the US Mac key position of the "currency" mark (unicode
    00A4)(resembling an "o" with diagonal cross bars poking out around its edges,
    but not crossing through the middle) before the Euro mark (unicode 20AC) was introduced,
    and many older font versions will have that character instead.

  body: And for those people who have fonts produced before the euro was introduced,
    Adobe added a file folder packed full of different styles on their semi-recent
    CD.

    would be some cause for keeping it in fonts in the interest of backwards compatibility,
    but just how much of one?"
