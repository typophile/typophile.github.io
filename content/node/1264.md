body: This one is driving me nuts. It&#39;s really close to a lot of fonts, but not
  quite there. It&#39;s from the classified section of a newspaper in Florida. <BR>
  <BR>I hope I&#39;m not missing something obvious. It doesn&#39;t match anything
  I have, and Identifont didn&#39;t lead me to the right one, either. Thanks! <BR>

  body: Waitasecond ... Font Bureau&#39;s Poynter Agate? <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t tell
    from their sample in their book, but it looks really close. <BR> <BR>&#40;OK,
    so I forgot I had their catalog...&#41;

  body: I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s it.  <BR> <BR>Poynter Agate is a &#34;call
    for pricing&#34; font, so I&#39;m guessing Font Bureau doesn&#39;t publish a full
    sample so as to keep it out of the hands of  dirty, stinkin&#39; font pirates.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, Sept 19th is International Talk Like A Pirate Day.  Pass it on,
    Mateys! <BR> <BR>&#40;Did you like that segue?&#41;
