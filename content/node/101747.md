body: "Hi there,\r\nI'm working on a logo and need some help identifying the right
  font to use.  \r\nI'm looking for a sans-serif font with soft rounded edges, preferablly
  something with a single-stack lowercase \"a\".  I like the humanistic qualities
  of Avenir but obviously this font isn't rounded.  \r\n\r\nI also like the style
  of the font in the new esurance logo, which I have attached below. \r\n\r\nFonts
  that I've considered so far include:\r\n1. Comforta (although I feel like it's almost
  too rounded).\r\n2. Museo (getting closer but some of the elements remind me of
  an old typewriter font). \r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be really helpful.  Thanks
  so much! \r\nAdon\r\n\r\n"

    isn''t very well crafted, which is another reason I didn''t want to use it.'
