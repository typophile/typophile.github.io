  to get a sense of years and designers involved.\r\n\r\nWhich were the first type
  families to formally and officially include <strong>a)</strong> bold weights <strong>b)</strong>
  italic versions and <strong>c)</strong> condensed and extended versions?\r\n\r\nHow
  groundbreaking was Univers in selling the packaged type family that included different
  weights and widths? Were there others before it?\r\n\r\nHopefully these are not
  too open-ended either."

  body: "The first families were the work T. L. Devinne was doing around 1899, details
    are on pages 47 and 48 of Southall\u2019s <em>Printer\u2019s Type in the Twentieth
    Century</em>. IIRC Stanley Morrison was also grouping existing types around the
    same time. ATF started using the term family in the early 1900s, the oldest specimen
    I have verified this in was the 1912 book.\r\n\r\nRegarding Univers, what made
    the Univers package important was not what was offered, families like Cheltenham
    and Akzidenz were already doing that. What made Univers so special was that the
    whole family was planned from the start rather than releasing a few weights and
    later (inconsistently) designing more fonts based on demand from printers (although
    it did take several years for all of the fonts to hit the market, the release
    was not simultaneous). Univers was also released simultaneously for metal and
    photocomposition and available for license to anyone, another reason it was a
    big hit with designers. I think that Sebastian Carter wrote a detailed account
    in <em>Twentieth-Century Type Designers</em>, but my notes are missing so it might
    be elsewhere."

  body: "Thanks for the scans Nick.\r\nAnd thanks for the info James.\r\n\r\nWhat
    about condensed fonts? The woodtypes of the 19th century are probably the earliest
    examples of typefaces with similar design traits produced in various widths to
    accommodate all those crazy type posters we love so much, but were those typefaces
    considered a family? Or just independent stacks of letters? Who was the first
    to, as you say James, plan a condensed version from the start?"

  body: "The first design with multiple widths (but only one weight) that Lawson mentions
    is Alternate Gothic. Linotype lists Alternate Gothic as dating to 1903, so it
    could be the one. Dates for what was going on in Europe at this time are murky
    at best, which is probably why they don\u2019t get mentioned much, but it would
    be worth asking James Mosley if he knows of an earlier example from that side
    of the pond.\r\n\r\nIf you lump News Gothic and Lightline gothic together they
    might be the first example of a design being planned with a mix of weights and
    widths. New Gothic had one weight in three widths, lightline being the light weight
    in one width with a heavier all-caps titling font. These were introduced in 1908,
    and Linotype does not mention additions prior to 1958. I don\u2019t know why Lightline
    wasn\u2019t marketed as a light News Gothic, as there are only minor noticeable
    changes in a few minuscules.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As for your question about the wood types of the 19th century, they weren\u2019t
    being marketed as families. They would have been sold as Gothic No.1, Gothic No.
    2, Caslon Uber-Sized, etc.. They were probably not designed together; display
    types were so popular with typefounders in this period not only because printers
    liked them but also because it was cheap to just design one font (with limited
    character sets) at a time."

  body: "M.F. Benton's original Franklin Gothic would have been around the same time
    as Alternate Gothic (Nos. 1, 2, & 3) and News Gothic/Lightline Gothic. The original
    three fonts were normal width, Condensed, and Extra Condensed (I think those were
    the designations -- I don't have my ATF with me right this minute). I'll double-check
    dates later when I get home.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Cheltenham family, which James and
    Nick mentioned a couple times already, was designed and released with condensed
    widths integrated pretty much from the get-go. Also the same basic time period.
    Also ATF & MF Benton.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    Condensed was 1906/1906\r\n\r\nThe Cheltenham condensed weights were not available
    from the start either. It was begun by Bertram Goodhue as a book face in 1894.
    Benton/ATF licensed in 1902 (Linotype did the same) and the additional designs
    from ATF trickled out between 1902 and 1913. I\u2019m not sure what designs were
    in Goodhue\u2019s original; Lawson shows an image of sketches of a regular and
    italic by Goodhue, but with no date. With a date this might contradict Southall\u2019s
    notion that the De Vinne originated the design of an integrated family in 1899."

  body: Cool. One more test... How about display styles? Like Hoefler&Frere-Jones'
    Requiem that comes in Text, Display and Fine... I am guessing that this is a tradition
    from the good old days when each typeface was cast at different point sizes, so
    it was just a "default" to design the bigger font sizes so that the contrast stayed
    at a maximum.

    Fleischman (1707\u20131768) somes to my mind. Stanley Morison wrote about Fleischman\u2019s
    typefaces: \u2018As a whole, Fleischman\u2019s founts represent the first personal,
    individualist interpretation of Roman and Italic.\u2019 (Stanley Morison: Letter
    Forms, p. 26)\r\n\r\nI think that Renaissance punchcutters simply would not have
    understood the notion or concept of a \u2018personal style\u2019 or \u2018individualist
    interpretation\u2019 in punchcutting, whereas in the times of Caslon, Fleischman,
    Rosart and Fournier this concept slowly started to make sense. \r\n\r\nThe concept
    of a typeface family came much later (when the pantograph had already won over
    the punchcutter), and it seems to me to be a concept driven almost entirely my
    marketing purposes.\r\n\r\nMichael Twyman wrote an interesting article about how
    the printers slowly figured out that they might probably need something like a
    bold typeface. \r\nMichael Twyman: \u2018The bold idea\u2019, in: Journal of the
    Printing Historical Society, no 22, 1993, pp 107\u2013143\r\n\r\nHarry Carter
    wrote about Francois Guyot (?\u20131570):\r\n\u2018Guyot, as you see, matched
    his Double Pica and Pica Romans with Italics, evidently with an intention that
    they should work together: Nobody had done that before: Italic had been a text-letter
    alternative to Roman.\u2019\r\n(Harry Carter: A view of early typography, pp 96\u201397)\r\nFor
    an illustration of Guyot\u2019s Double Pica and Pica Romans with Italics see:\r\nHarry
