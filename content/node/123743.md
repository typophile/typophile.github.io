  body: "Eric Gill's documentation about Alphabet stone [Roman alphabet carved on
    Hoptonwood stone] http://www.worldcat.org/title/alphabet-stone-roman-alphabet-carved-on-hoptonwood-stone/oclc/744681743\r\nAbstract:\r\n---start
    quote--\r\nEngraved by Eric Gill (1882-1940), the work was commissioned by the
    New York printer George Grady (1885-1956) for the library in his home in Stamford,
    Connecticut. The New York calligrapher Paul Standard served as Grady's contact
    with Gill, after Grady had seen a similar Gill alphabet stone in an exhibition,
    English present-day calligraphy and illumination, organized by Standard and on
    view in New York in February 1938. The London firm Sculpture and Memorials acted
    as Gill's agent for the commission. Accompanying the stone is a note from Gill
    stating: \"I cut this A.B.C. on July 1st & 2nd 1938 on HoptonWood Stone for Mr.
    Grady. The colouring was done by Michael Richey.\" The stone is signed and dated
    in the lower right corner, with Gill's monogram [EG 1938]; it arrived in New York
    in January 1939.\r\n\r\nThe original shipping and customs documents were acquired
    with the stone. Grady's correspondence with Paul Standard, George T. Friend, Eric
    Gill, and the London firm Sculpture and Memorials regarding the commission was
    donated later by John C. Grady.\r\n---end quote--\r\nDon"
