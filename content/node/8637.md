body: Hello! <BR> <BR>I have a small business I do on the side which is graphic design
  and websites. I am in the process of creating a business card for myself. I would
  like to do it on clear plastic like Mike Haska did in a previous post. <BR> <BR>The
  blue area is going to be clear. This will allow the white border/stroke around the
  &#39;eh&#39; to stand out and the white stripe at the bottom to also stand out.
  <BR> <BR>I am going to print the white stripe at the bottom on the back of the card
  to give it some depth. I would like to do the same the same for the white around
  &#39;eh&#39; but am unsure if that would look ok since it would be on the back.
  <BR> <BR>I would be greatly appreciative any comments on my design - layout, design,
  fonts, etc. Say anything and it will be taken in consideration...  <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for the help in advance - Troy <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/62922.jpg"

  body: The maple leaf seems small for the size of the white outline. It chomps into
    the leaf like an insect would. That poor little stem is almost cut off.   <BR>
    <BR>Reducing the &#34;eh&#34; or enlarging the leaf &#40;maybe rotating and only
    showing a portion of it&#41; would eliminate the eaten leaf effect.  <BR> <BR>The  list
    at the bottom shouldn&#39;t start with a hyphen, and I&#39;m not sure hyphens
    are a good choice for separators. If you do use them, they should only be between
    items and evenly spaced.

  body: I think your text is a tad large. Hang the punctuaion &#40;on Ave.&#41;. Loose
    the bullet points at the bottom, IMHO. It makes it look like a yellow pages ad.
    Lumping Graphic design with Computer sales seems quite odd.  <BR> <BR>If you want
    to offer these services, I&#39;d suggest making multiple cards. &#40;eh Design,
    eh Computer Sales, eh Web Hosting&#41; etc. <BR> <BR>As for the logo...it&#39;s
    a clever canuck reference, but, at the same time, somewhat negative, isn&#39;t
    it? &#34;How&#39;s my work? eh. so-so.&#34;

  body: 'Troy, everything is to big. Reduce the size of everything allow some white
    space. Don&#39;t tell the whole story of your business, allow a potential a chance
    to ask questions. Your copy at the bottom makes you seem like a Kmart &#40;you
    do everything&#41;. I would change it to read: Website Hosting '

  body: Thanks for all the tips and thoughts. I am going to play with it a bit tonight
    and when I get changed I will post it again. <BR> <BR>As for the Computer sales
    I am getting into that on the side with a frind of mine I think I will remove
    that since that is not a major part of the business.  <BR> <BR>As for the eh chomping
    into the leaf I am going to make the white border around it a bit smaller but
    I have been using this logo as it is for awhile now. <BR> <BR>Good thought about
    the hyphens and the . after Ave.  <BR> <BR>Thanks again for the suggestions.

  body: Hi Troy, <BR> <BR>Just a note on material type. Even though I started off
    with the intent of going with a plastic card, I eventually decided to go with
    a translucent paper. My main reasons for the switch were to facilitate a faster
    printing time, to reduce costs, and because I wasn&#39;t 100% comfortable with
    completely clear cards. <BR> <BR>My concern was that in a business card folder
    or a stack of cards, my card might &#39;disappear&#39; when the the card behind
    it shows through. I was a little worried that my card would be too much like a
    chameleon, blending in with the background... <BR> <BR>Since your card has a large,
    colourful logo with a white border, this effect might be mitigated, but I can
    tell you that I&#39;ve had tonnes of compliments with my translucent cards &#40;I
    don&#39;t think I&#39;ve suffered because of the switch, in any case.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Also, on the design of your card, I would agree with the comments suggesting
    sizing down the elements to increase the amount of white space. Also, you might
    try swapping the position of your name/title and your address. I think a more
    central location on the card would give your name more precidence over the other
    elements... <BR> <BR>Can&#39;t wait to see the redesign! <BR> <BR>-Mike

  body: I agree with Darrel and Daniel&#39;s suggestions, but would also like to see
    you revise your typeface choices. Your logo face is between a print and a script,
    in that limbo with Comic Sans. Maybe try using your own handwriting or creating
    a few custom letters in Illustrator. On the other extreme, the body copy on the
    right just looks transcribed. Try exaggerating the sizes; you can read down to
    7 or 8pt comfortably with quality printing. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to see some
    iterations with more playful placement of the card&#39;s elements.

  body: I would have to say, increase the type size, especially on the bottom line,  <BR>
    <BR>Nothing would emphasize LOWER PRICING than just making the leap straight into
    Comic Sans. <BR> <BR>Eh?

  body: I&#39;m not sure I agree with all of the thoughtful comments posted here but
    I do concur that the maple leaf is a bit dwarfed by the &#34;eh.&#34;   <BR> <BR>I
    am also interested in purchasing a business card that is transparent with two
    color ink used for the text.  Does anyone know of a good printer in Canada that
    makes them? <BR> <BR>Thank you, <BR> <BR>Ken Bleyer
