  old gang at it still.\r\n\r\nI've been asked to evaluate Ecofont, and am coming
  up short with actual data, or even anyone saying they use it. http://www.ecofont.eu/ecofont_en.html\r\n\r\nMy
  thought is it's gimmicky, and the same thing could be accomplished much more easily
  \ by: \r\nPrinting 25% fewer pages\r\nWriting 25% fewer words\r\nMake the font size
  25% smaller\r\nUse lightweight fonts, Don\u2019t use bold anything.\r\nSet your
  font fill color to a 75% black.\r\n\r\nBut I need to give a fair assessment to well-intentioned
  people. Does anyone have even anecdotal experience to share?  \r\n\r\nThanks all,\r\n\r\nJoe\r\n"

    the fill colour to 75% accomplishes the same thing and still lets you use any
    font you like, and as someone else suggested in another thread about this, it
    takes a certain amount of energy to render all those little holes. \r\n"

  body: "In order to measure it's effectiveness you first need to (get your client
    to) define what they mean by \"effective.\" Until then, you're chasing your client's
    tail.\r\n\r\nAnd if you are looking for data, you'll need to conduct some sort
    of experiment, be it laboratory or online questionnaire. In this instance your
    independent variable (the one you change) is looking like typeface, and other
    aspects of type.\r\n\r\nThe roadblock you're coming up is with the dependent variable
    (what you measure) which your client has simply defined as \"effectiveness.\"
    This could mean comprehension, time, visual search, fatigue, memory, aesthetic
    appeal &c.\r\n\r\nOnce that has been established you'll need to design an experiment
    which uses these variables. If you want reliable data then you will need to do
    things such as control your population, make sure everything is counterbalanced
    &c.\r\n\r\nLastly, you'll need to statistically analyze your data to see if your
    manipulations had a significant (outside the possibility of random chance) effect
    (pun intended).\r\n\r\nShort answer, collaborate with a cognitive psychologist
    from your local university (experimental, not clinical) with a background in reading
    comprehension. You may get lucky and find a masters or PhD student who will make
    this a project. This is not an easy task, but I applaud the people of ecofont
    for looking at it this way. And their cause."

    on [[http://www.ecofont.com/en_disclaimer.html]]you can read the following;\r\n
    ...Ecofont B.V. collaborates with the owner or licensor of a font. We have received
    permission for the processing of a font into an Ecofont font and its use in Ecofont.\r\n...If
    you use Ecofont, we ensure that you have permission to use the Ecofont fonts.
    You are yourself responsible for possessing the correct licences for the font
    on which the Eco variant is based (the source font), e.g. Arial, Times New Roman

  body: "I seldom join a discussion on the Ecofont, but this forum topic triggerd
    my attention. In november 2008 SPRANQ creative communications, the Netherlands
    released the free Ecofont, that shows that ink saving holes can be made in glyphs
    while maintaining readability of the printed text. The Free version is no more
    than a way to show the principle. It does work, but it has some drawbacks. \r\n\r\nOur
    'bigger plan': to apply the ink saving holes to widely used typefaces. Users will
    no longer need an (extra) typeface, but can use their normal fonts and print their
    text using less ink. For some typefaces, the ink savings (corpssize 10) add up
    to a mere 45%.\r\n\r\nThe professional software is available for both home and
    business use. Please note that the Ecofont solution is a printing solution and
    not made/meant for offset.  \r\n\r\nMicha's analysis is correct; we do have the
    right permissions to do so, but only so under strict regulations.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGerjon
    Zomer \r\nCo-owner SPRANQ / manager Ecofont"

  body: "A Dutch magazine\u2019s art director (Piet Schreuders for VPRO Gids) just
    responded to a readers' question (why not use Ecofont throughout, instead of once)
    and his answer is (translating/paraphrasing):\r\n\r\nOver my dead body.\r\n- It
    is ugly\r\n- It is a sans and not usable for textmaterial\r\n- It is less economic
    (less words per page than a normal typeface)\r\n- Using holes in a glyph only
    works with bolder type. It is easier to save ink by using normal widths\r\n- Ecofonts
    apparantly was developed for office use. Where toner and ink are best saved by
    printing less (which also saves paper)\r\n- The Eco-font is, in short, a beautiful
    example of fashionable humbug."

    if Ecofont actually results in significant ink in comparison to Vera when both
    are used to print the same text at text sizes.
