    oop problem problem problem... ahhhhhhhhh!\"\r\nDid FontLab meltdown?\r\nsometimes
    Illustrator's simplify path is good for removing a lot of redundant points."

  body: I was thinking about this a bit more- simplifying paths can be okay but it
    tends to look like a simplified path which is to say - not great. On the other
    hand manually placing 2000 points per glyph could be painful. I wonder how Device
    does it. Does anybody here ( Veer folks? ) have any insight to offer us?

  body: "It looked really bad when I tried to simplify it. It became more pixelated,
    and less authentic looking. \r\n\r\nFontlab is such a trooper and never gave up,
    but it took me sometimes up to 30 seconds to just move the letters to other parts
    of the window."

    talk about where golden mean between detail & efficiency might be."

  body: The problem is that the more points you have, the longer it will take to print
    a job using the resulting font. Does FontLab have an equivalent to FOG's Clean
    Up Paths feature?
