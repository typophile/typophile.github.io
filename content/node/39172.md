    was wondering which font metric governs the text-frame-to-baseline measurement
    in various programs, such as Quark in my example. \r\n\r\nI try to keep the final
    Font BBox measurement (top right y-axis value) consistent within font families,
    that seems to work, but I wondered if there was more to it than that."

  body: "What Read Roberts found on the Mac was that some applications calculate the
    distance from the top of the text box to the baseline of the first line of text
    as hhea Ascender, and some calculate it as hhea Ascender + Linegap. On Windows,
    OS/2 WinAscent is almost always used to calculate this distance. So the only way
    to ensure consistency everywhere is to match the hhea Ascender value to the OS/2
    WinAscent value, while setting the hhea Linegap value to zero, *presuming\"\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure what a WPF app will do to calculate the distance if fsSelection bit 7
    has been set to instruct the app to use the OS/2 Typo values to calculate linespacing:
    it may use TypoAscender, or it may use TypoAscender + TypoLineGap, or it may use
    WinAscent. Of course, if you have made the decision to use fsSelection bit 7,
    that is most likely because your Typo values do not sum to your Win values, i.e.
    you want to decouple linespacing from clipping. So then you are back at cross-platform
    compatibility issues."

    it may be a font cache issue, where the OS is not displaying your most recent

  body: "Nick, \r\n\r\nsend me the font, I'll take a look. \r\n\r\nGeneral: keep in
    mind that this stuff is VERY different for OTPS, OTTT and Type 1. Each format
    has its own peculiarities depending on the system and the app used. \r\n\r\nFor
    example, I have found out is that for one font format, I have now forgotten which,
    one version of InDesign used UPM minus Descender to position the first line of
    text rather than using Ascender (I think it was OpenType PS and TypoDescender,
    but am not sure). So if you made Ascender+Descender <> UPM size, the first line
    was off by a different offset than the rest. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nI had the same Problem with two fonts (normal and small-caps)
    of the same family, the small-caps produced a wider linespacing than the normal
    weight. All vertical metric values were equal. I think TextEdit does not look
    at any metric values. It measures the font boundingbox by itself.\r\nThe source
    of the problem was a missing extreme point at the bottom of a cedilla. A BCP-handel
    was placed far below the descender. After setting the extreme point everything
    was fine.\r\nI think checking your accents is a good idea.\r\n\r\nEigi"

  body: "While working on a photofont plugin for AID, QXP and web we have this problem
    with vertical (and also horizontal) layout of text in a text block. Since from
    the block that has to be served by plugin we have absolutely no access to any
    pixel outside it, we have to fit everything inside to avoid any kind of glyph
    cutting. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it makes impossible typographically correct layout
    of the text (lsb on the left, ascender or ascender+linegap on the top): what should
    we do with script-like fonts which extend outside the left margin line? The same
    problem happens with top layout: in fonts similar to Zapfino Ink many glyphs extend
    vertically beyound ascender and even UPM line. \r\n\r\nSo far we found no other
    solution for the \"top-left\" problem then using font bounding box - this is the
    only way to make sure that no part of a glyph will disappear. Unfortunately it
    makes difficult to align text blocks on the page, requiring some manual control.
    \r\n\r\nAnother problem would be to define \"typographically correct\" font bounding
    box: some glyphs will never appear as leftmost on a text line (take accents made
    \"old\" way with negative left sidebearing) but may have big impact on calculating
    font bbox. We have no good solution for this right now, but we continue research.
    \r\n\r\nIn photofonts detecting glyph (and font) bounding box has additional level
    of complexity: since glyph image has \"smooth\" transparency, it is not easy to
    draw a line of where it actually ends."
