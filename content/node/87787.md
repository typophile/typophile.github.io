body: "Hello, can anyone tell me how I remove existing ligatures in a font completely?\r\nI
  have tried to delete the relevant glyph cells and then delete the 'liga' from the
  OT panel. The only problem is that the font has already been kerned for use and
  it's as though it still sees the coding for the deleted glyphs which means it won't
  let me re-generate it. ANy ideas?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nStimopo "

    it to show pairs in order of the left glyph, and delete every instance of the
    ligature. Then switch to order by the right glyph and delete every instance of
    the ligature. That should fix it.\r\n\r\nAlternately you could generate a kern
    feature, copy/paste it to a text file, and strip all lines referencing the ligature
    with a good text editor like Textwrangler or command-line tools like sed. Then
    just dump the fix feature in and don\u2019t allow Fontlab to generate a new feature
    later."

  body: "Hi, thanks for your advice. I tried option one \u2013 I am not sure whether
    I should delete the individual glyph cells first before deleting the kerning code
    or vice versa? The ligature codes only seem to display when the glyph cells still
    exist, but then it won't let me delete the code (I highlight the kerning numbers
    and press 'delete'). Any ideas?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nStimopo"

  body: "Maybe this is a dumb question, but why is it crucial to delete them ompletely?
    If you remove them from the liga (or dlig) feature, they won't be accessed unless
    you explicitly select them from the glyph panel. So if you don't like the ligatures,
    why not simply remove them from the opentype layout features, but leave the glyphs
    intact. This has the advantage that if you change your mind later it will be much
    easier to restore them.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    works!!! (Originally I deleted the actual glyph cells and then the liga feature,
    but Fontlab was still seeing the code and wouldn't let me re-generate it).\r\n\r\nThank
    you :)"
