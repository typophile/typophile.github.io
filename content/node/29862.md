    to have been acquired by Font Factory but I have not found Greco Deco on that
    site.

  body: "I thought Greco Deco was caps only, like Greco Adornado. Both were shown
    from Franklin Typefounders in the old Precision Type catalog. The font 'Greco',
    also from Franklin, had a different lower case than the posted sample. 'Bristol'
    is apparently the new FontHaus name for this old Spanish typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike

      $50 for the font, and it is not the same... So I wanted to see if there is any
      way to buy Greco Deco, and that way what they are paying for is going to match
      what they want.\r\nThank you!"

  body: I hate to be hard selly, but the advantage of investing in a family like Celestia
    is you get complimentary styles. It's $49 for <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=MVB.118636.0.0">Adornado,
    Bold, Inline, and Ornaments</a>. This means much more flexibility for the client
    down the line.

      buy something that matches exactly to what they have been using. But at this
      point I think I need to tell them to switch to Celestina because this is the
      only one available, it seems.\r\nThank you!"

  body: "I think this is the first time you've said that it was only caps. Doesn't
    that mean we have only found something with the same initials? Maybe if you mixed
    the Bristol initials with Celestia Adornado you would have the closest combination
    we can find offhand.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to try to find the Serif font
    that had the other letters of 'oston, assachusetts' without regard to the ornamented
    aspect. That 'c' and 't', and diagonally stressed 'o' are pretty distinctive.\r\n\r\n-

    typefaces</a>, especially Goudy Catalog, are quite close to the lower case lettering

      I have, but I didn't want all information to appear.\r\nBut at this point, I
      think I'd show everything. Numbers match with Bristo Adornado. I don't know
      about Greco Deco, but I'm sure they match with it too. As for them beeing all
      caps font, I am not sure what to do... I don't think it's worth it to draw the
      effect on all lower case letters from Goudy.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Boston_6680.jpg]"

  body: "I'd just go with the Celestina. It's very close, just a little rougher. In
    fact the Greco Deco I have is also more 'filled in' than the sample, Bristol and
    Celestina are a little more open.\r\n\r\nFor the numerals, tho, the attempt at
    lining figs is very awkward, the 0, 1 and 2 really don't match the weight of the
    other numbers."
