  While I've slowly bought up quite a few OpenType fonts over the last couple of years,
  I still have a fair number of TrueType fonts that I'm quite fond of.\r\n\r\nI know
  there are a million threads and sites out there explaining the differences between
  PC and Mac fonts. I have actually tried to read as many of them as I can, but my
  brain is just overloaded right now. So, please, just pretend I'm a five-year-old
  and dumb it down for me! :)\r\n\r\n1. Is there a free way to continue using those
  TrueType fonts on a Mac? I read somewhere that if you rename TrueTypes as OpenType
  they'll keep working, but somehow that sounds too simple to be right...\r\n\r\n2.
  If not - what's the easiest solution? Use TransType pro to convert everything to
  a Mac format or OpenType?\r\n\r\nSorry if this is a 'dummies' level question - I
  have never been good at comprehending technical information and I'm feeling a bit
  lost at the moment, lol. Thanks. :)"

    Copy them over, and stick them in your FONTS folder in OSX.\r\n\r\nAren't Macs
    great? :o)"

    Mac and Windows formats)\r\n    * PostScript Type 1 (Mac only)\r\n    * PostScript
    Multiple Master (Mac only)\r\n    * TrueType (both Mac and Windows formats)\r\n
    \   * dFont (data fork TrueType) (Mac only) \r\n\r\nOS9 did not support all of
    these, so you are now free to use your windows truetype files.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    clueless me :)</cite>\r\nThis is not a dumb question. PostScript Type 1 fonts
    were for a long time, the industry standard for professional typesetting. These
    fonts were, and still are, platform specific. For example, a windows PostScript
    font uses two files with .pfm and .pfb extensions. This is the one format not
    currently supported by Mac OS at the system level.\r\nThere is a way to get these
    fonts to show up in Adobe applications only, but I would only look into that if
    you have a real need. Also, to be clear about your first post, you should not
    rename anything. It probably wouldn't cause a problem, but it's certainly not
    necessary.  "

  body: "Just to clarify, there do not exist separate Mac and Windows versions of
    OpenType fonts. There exist OpenType fonts with TrueType outlines, and OpenType
    fonts with PostScript style outlines; both flavors are cross-platform font files.\r\n\r\nAs
    a side note, the dividing line between OpenType fonts with TrueType outlines and
    Windows TrueType fonts is very thin indeed, and one often doesn't even need to
    make a distinction between the two.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
