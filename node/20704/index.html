<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody><strong>Typophile Type Battles to be Exhibited at TypeCon2006 in August
Deadline for Submission: July 5, 2006</strong>
At TypeCon 2006, the TypeGallery will showcase a selection of submissions from the weekly Type Battles that have raged in the Typophile forums this year. 
On behalf of SOTA and Typophile, we'd like to invite you to submit a high-resolution version of your entry (or entries) to be printed and displayed in the TypeGallery this August in Boston. In addition to appearing on Typophile and live in Boston, some pieces may travel internationally after the conference, and/or may be selected for print publication and display on the TypeGallery website.
You may submit any selection of your entries from one or all of the battles you participated in. We are also interested in showing extensions of what was displayed in the Type Battles on Typophile. If you have continued working on your entries, please show us what you've done! Due to space constraints, this is a juried showcase, and we will use our discretion as to which pieces will be chosen for the exhibit.
- Each piece will be printed on a tabloid (11in x 17in, 280mm x 432mm) sheet, black ink. Please scale appropriately. Pieces can be in landscape or portrait mode.
- Please submit a <strong>hi-res, scaled version in either EPS, TIFF or PDF</strong> formats. Native Illustrator documents will also be accepted, though not preferred.
- Submissions in JPG, GIF, PNG, .fog, or .vfb formats will <strong>not</strong> be accepted.
- Label each file as such: <strong>Battle#_lastname_#.eps</strong> (example: Battle1_evens_1.eps) Please see the list of battles below, and name them accordingly.
Battle 1 -- Blackletter / Slab
Battle 2 -- Franklin Gothic Swashes
Battle 3 -- Triline Pixel
Battle 4 -- Cooper Black ligatures
Battle 5 -- MICR letters
Battle 6 -- Found Type
Battle 7 -- Script Hobo
Battle 8 -- 3D by Hand
Battle 9 -- 'ch' 'th' 'sh' sounds
Battle 10 -- S S S S
Battle 11 -- More S S S S
Battle 12 -- Lowercase for text
Battle 13 -- Pointing hand dingbat
Battle 14 -- Alternate ampersands
The <strong>deadline for submission is July 5, 2006.</strong> Please zip your files (not over 10mb please), include your full name and send submissions to: evens@punchcut.com. If you have files larger than 10mb, please send us a link where we can download the images.
If you wish to contribute sketches on paper or other non-digital material, please send photos or scans of the material so that we may review them for inclusion in the show.
<strong>We look forward to hearing from you and hope you'll consider being a part of the SOTA TypeGallery this year!</strong>
If you have any questions, please let us know.

<div class=commentbody>David, Which application did you use to create the pixel drawings? If you created them in Photoshop, you should be able to export the paths to vector shapes, which can then be scaled.
You may submit non-digital work as a scan or high quality photograph. If you'd like to submit the original piece, or a quality duplicate of the original, you may mail that in directly, but not before having a photograph of it reviewed first by the curators of the exhibit.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If they're at actual size, Zara, wouldn't that make them really small? (screen res being 72px/inch and print res being 300px/inch)
As far as exporting paths goes (sorry I'm recooping from a week of little to no sleep) I'm selecting the pixels and going to the 'Make Paths From Selection' but the paths are all screwy, are there settings to make this work?</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>If they’re at actual size, Zara, wouldn’t that make them really small?</cite>
Yes, indeed, they would be small. It is my understanding that a selection of submissions <cite>may</cite> be shown on screen.
I honestly can't say I've done much path exporting myself, I tend to draw with vector tools while in photoshop. I use a little trick that might work for you. Assuming your Photoshop doc is a bitmap, you can save as a PDF and then open this in Illustrator. You won't be able to edit the image, but it can be scaled as large as you want.</div>

<div class=commentbody>David, if you save your pixel file as bitmap (.BMP), and then import into Illustrator, you can scale as you please and, in theory, the pixels remain perfectly square. I don't know what this tri pixel thingies look like, but this is the way to export pixel-based work and be able to scale it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the help, I was just pulling a blank as I tried to figure this out. I converted my pixel renderings to 1800 px/in Bitmap images > Scaled up 300% > Made a selection of the black pixels > Convert Selection To Path I think Photoshop just had trouble establishing paths when each line was only one pixel thick.
I'm sending you my boards now, Zara!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Zara,
Is the Type Battle work going to be the only thing in the TypeGallery this year? Other years also had submissions of new fonts done in that year. I was wondering if I could also submit non-Battle items in another part of the Gallery?

<div class=commentbody>Zara, you might want to include <a href=http://typophile.com/node/16343>an amusing exercise</a> in the show, as it was kind of a battle before the battle was established. Also it has some terrific and amusing stuff by Mark Simonson, among others. Also apparently it went all over the internet. </div>

No, there will be a much larger variety of work in the TypeGallery. If you are interesting in submitting work outside of the Type Battles, you will need to contact Shu at SOTA. I'll point him to this thread so he may respond with the necessary information.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello all. I hope everyone is heartily preparing their Type Battle work for the show. Just to let everyone known, the Type Battles are just one part of what will be the biggest TypeGallery ever. There will be a TypeGallery unjuried call for submissions just as in previous years. The new website will be launching very, very soon. Very soon. There will be more info there as well as a preview of some work before the conference. But, just for a taste here are some of the other shows will we have the pleasure of showcasing this year.
TDC show
Blackletter in Mexico
Letras Latinas
Boston Calligraphy group show
Curated Letterpress
That is not even near a full list. It will be grand.
