  body: Tiffany there were alot of ripoff fonts that look like Bauhaus. I suggest
    this is one of them. The g is differentand so is the n and h and t. It has the
    feel of one of the old Letraset fonts.

  body: I think Tim&#39;s right -- a customized version of Chalet, mixing the features
    of London 1970 &#40;b, e, g&#41; and 1980 &#40;t&#41;, and modifying the n and
    h.
