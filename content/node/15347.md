  font theory (what is serif and sans serif font) either. \r\nI am definitely looking
  for a guide in which various fonts are exposed.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I would like
  a book in which \"classical\" fonts from various periods are shown. Fonts that can
  be bought and used.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance. \r\n\r\nRegards."

    was released during the 1980s as a \"better\" match in widths to Linotype's Helvetica.
    I thought it was retired after Agfa-Monotype alliance, but apparently not.\r\n\r\nI
    really don't think there are too many type users who would remember using the
    family.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nYes, I'm old, but
