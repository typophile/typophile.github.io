  body: "I really like all the block letters apart from B and R but don't think the
    small sans looks right with them.\r\n\r\nIs it meant to look early 20th Century,
    e.g. Constructivism, or is it late 1970s vintage computer lettering? \"Man Machine\"
    instantly makes me think of the Kraftwerk album. Are you doing something music-related?
    If so I imagine it would be electronic with that name, yet the green shape reminds
    me of the centre-hole adaptors for old 7\" 45s. Something I'd associate with older
    styles of music.\r\n\r\n\r\nI need to know more about what you do to give more
    help."
