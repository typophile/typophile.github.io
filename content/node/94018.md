  body: "In VOLT, you put the substitution string in the top part of the lookup window,
    and the context in the lower part, on the left or right of the | depending on
    whether the context is before or after the glyph(s) to be substituted. [Note that
    left/right refer in the contexts to before/after, and are not directional, i.e.
    for a RTL script like Hebrew, the before context still sits to the left of the
    | marker.]\r\n\r\nI presume you are wishing to substitute qamats qatan for the
    regular qamats when it follows (?) maqaf. If so the lookup would be like this:\r\n\r\n<code>qamats
    -> qamats_qatan\r\nmaqaf |</code>"
