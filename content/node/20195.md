  its all about branding and brand strategy etcetera - at http://www.brandlibra.com\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  apologies for the shameless self plug, but what my companions and I wondered was
  whether we had the right idea in choosing such a trendy Web 2.0 font, specifically
  Arial Rounded Bold, for the site.\r\n\r\nWe really liked the friendly and approachable
  nature of Arial Rounded Bold and thought it would be great to convey the straightforward
  feel we wanted for the site.  Perfect for our \"brand\" as a straightfoward, no
  b.s. branding and marketing site.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, one member of our group
  of friends thought that it was the completely wrong feel for a website for branding
  and marketing strategy and drew too many comparisons, especially to http://myspace.com
  and http://zopa.com.  \r\n\r\nI (well, actually we) would appreciate comments you
  good people have for how to use this font, and whether our application is completely
  off the wall.  Are we promising something we are not (trendy Web 2.0 site) with
  our usage of this font?  How should Arial Rounded Bold be used?\r\n\r\nThank you
  all very much in advance for your input, and we really do appreciate your opinions!"

    something from Erik Spiekermann or Porchez Typofonderie."
