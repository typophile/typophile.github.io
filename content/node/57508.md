body: "How can I define a basic character set? Do you know where I can look for character
  sets made at foundries and stuff? I know that you don't need to have all characters
  to use a font, but it look kinda unprofessional when I put any character with the
  keyboard and the notdef glyph appears. So, I suppose I should base a basic character
  set in the Windows 1252 and Mac Roman. But there's also a couple of characters that
  are added by the Type 1 default character set (L with stroke, minus sign) and I
  have seen it in some fonts with basic character set that aren't Type 1 nor from
  Adobe. Is there a reason to still add them?\r\nThe MacRoman set seems to have changed
  at some point the code for the Omega (first the Ohm sign one, then the actual letter).
  I'm not sure if is need to add both. Many fonts adds the fi and fl ligatures in
  the private use area (I forgot the reason).\r\nA more extended character set generally
  includes Windows 1252 with Mac Roman plus the whole <em>Latin Extended A</em> Unicode
  block, and sometimes a few from the <em>Latin Extended B</em>.\r\nLooking the Windows
  and Mac encodings for other Latin languages, apart of Vietnamese, they include most
  of the <em>Latin Extended A</em> except for a few, so I wonder if these are necessary.
  Five are for compatibility with the ISO/IEC 6937 encoding (and the usage of them
  is somewhat debatable), some are deprecated characters used in Greenlandic like
  the Kra, some are for Maltese, some for Sami Languages, some for Esperanto and some
  for the Latin language. \r\nI suppose that adding the characters for Maltese is
  useful, since current keyboards have it.\r\nThe ones for Sami languages too, but
  there's also some characters from the extended B set used in Skolt Sami that also
  appears in the Sami keyboards, but I haven't seen much support for them. \r\nEsperanto
  is an artificial language and Latin is somewhat extinct, I don't know if they require
  a basic usage. Same with the deprecated Greenlandic Kra, which by now is on the
  same league of adding the letters with acute from Extended B for danish.\r\nWithout
  counting the usage of Vietnamese, which requires much more characters to work, the
  <em>I with tilde</em> seems a bit pointless. I think it was used in an old Greenlandic
  orthography but has not other current use.\r\nThere's also some languages that are
  almost supported with most of the extended sets, like Azeri (it need the Schwa,
  and seems that the keyboards have the seven roman number too) and Welsh (needs some
  W and Y with diacritics from the Latin Extended Aditional). Some language keyboards
  uses characters that aren't in the sets, like the Cruzeiro sign (no longer used)
  in Brazilian Portuguese (I don't remember other, but still).\r\nI also want to know
  what else characters are useful. I know that most stuff depends of what languages
  or uses I should orient the font first, but I'm a bit doubtful of where to start."

  body: "This is not what you are asking for but ...\r\n\r\nSadly, OSes and applications
    still do not provide the Unicode and OpenType support that is long overdue.* (Which
    is particularly odd since those who have spec'ed the format and maneuvred foundries
    into re-manufacturing their entire font libraries as OpenType fonts did not simultaneously
    provide the infrastructure that would allow such fonts to work properly, i.e.
    as spec'ed.)\r\nFor applications that offer proper support, you would not need
    to make up your mind whether to add an <em>I with tilde</em> or an <em>a with
    circumflex above and dot below</em> or any other precomposed diacritic letter.
    Such applications would, on character level, decompose such letters into their
    'bases' and 'marks'. And as long as your fonts contains the required encoded glyphs
    plus <em>mark</em> and <em>mkmk</em> features, the fonts would on the fly, on
    glyph level, compose the glyphs which represent the requested characters. What's
    more, these fonts would easily --&nbsp;with a pretty small glyph set&nbsp;-- immediately
    support exotic languages like Vietnamese, or Yoruba (many of whose diacritic letters
    are not considered in the Unicode charts),** or Cyrillic <em>[vowel] with acute</em>
    and <em>[vowel] with grave</em> combinations (which Unicode does not know of either).**\r\nThen,
    it were pointless to even waste time thinking about whether to add <em>I with
    tilde</em> or any other precomposed diacritic letter. Add base and mark glyphs,***
    and the rest is a game of combinations. No need to know about the particular requirements
    of this or that language.\r\n\r\nAs another observation, OSX allows creating <a
    href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2056.html#SECTION4-_KEY__ELEMENT\"
    target=\"_blank\">custom keyboard layouts</a> in which a single key serves to
    input an entire string rather than a single character. So one could create layouts
    such that hitting the <em>u with dieresis</em> key would not input <em>U+00FC</em>
    but the string <em>U+0075 U+0308</em> -- thus allow one to deal with canonically
    decomposed text right from the start. But this, as said, would require that OSes
    and applications support Unicode and OpenType more fully than they do today.\r\n\r\n*
    Which is related to my rant <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/56918#comment-342051\"
    target=\"_blank\">over here</a>.\r\n** And does not need to know because Unicode
    provides (de)composition rules.\r\n*** Properly encoded so they are identified
    as characters.\r\n\r\nNow I hope someone else will bring the discussion back on
    track.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)"

    I know is aware of them as far as I know. I know many people that really know
    a lot of typography but none is very aware of the technical stuff, so I feel a

  body: "Make sure you don't confuse characters with glyphs. Technically even a dumb
    font only  contains glyphs or outlines describing shapes, no more no less. Characters
    are functions of shapes that can coincide with single glyphs, multiple glyphs
    (in composition) or partial glyphs (in ligatures). When you ask for character
    sets, you are looking for functions, not outlines. Since you are referring to
    keystrokes - which as you probably realize do not generate glyphs. \r\n\r\nOf
    all the options you mentioned (like Windows 1252 and Mac Roman) none is really
    valid or relevant, with the exception of Unicode. In modern data technology, the
    latter is the only valid resource. \r\n\r\nThe strong point of Unicode is that
    - in principle - it contains all characters in use as well as any character ever
    used. If you can prove a character is missing, there's a procedure to get it added.\r\n\r\nThe
    weak point of Unicode is, that it does not provide languguage-dependent orthographic
    subsets as part of an implementation guide for guys like you and me, who want
    to use Unicode selectively and not in bulk, but only for specific languages. \r\n\r\nThe
    only way out is old-fashioned language research. Get at least one grammar for
    each language you want to support - or consult wikipedia for what it's worth -
    and figure out which letters each target language uses. Then look up the Unicode
    character for each letter, eliminate the doublets and finally decide how to represent
    the resulting characters: with a single glyph, broken up in multiple glyphs or
    merged with other glyphs. \r\n\r\nThen use smart font technology to get the relation
    between keystroke and graphic output correct. \r\n\r\nThomas Milo\r\nDecoType\r\nwww.decotype.com"

  body: "One thing to note, maybe echoing Karsten  -- most fonts lack the combining
    diacritics, the spacing modifiers, and the IPA phonetic characters (plus supplements).
    None of what Karsten is talking about will work without at least the combining
    diacritics. When you combine the need for them with the phonetic characters and
    spacing modifiers, there are few end-user (typesetting) work-arounds without glyphs
    for these characters.\r\n\r\nFore example, I'm currently involved with a book
    that samples a number of what are now called Native American languages. Most Native
    American languages are among the languages where the written form was derived
    by scholars, trying to capture the sound of the language. The one's I'm familiar
    with used the Latin alphabet, plus phonetic characters, plus diacriticals. It
    isn't that uncommon to see a phonetic character with a diacritic or two.\r\n\r\nAs
    for \"character sets,\" It would be very nice to have the pieces to work with.\r\n\r\nAs
    poorly as the foundries have supported the Unicode ideal, Fontlab Studio too doesn't
    support <cite>mark</cite> and <cite>mkmk</cite> I believe. It has occurred to
    me more than once that it would be easier for me as an end user to make the needed
    glyphs for Charis -- \"typographer's\" small caps, old-style numbers, proper ligatures,
    and kerning -- than to make everything needed for such work in, say, Minion. Alas,
    I can't work with Charis very well in FontLab.\r\n\r\nI think there will always
    be a need for the end user to be able to do some font work -- no designer can
    anticipate all needs and uses. The purist in me supports Karsten's reasonable
    rant, though in truth, as a typesetting company, we get a significant portion
    of our income because we can supplement & improve foundry offerings."

  body: "The task of defining a character set can be simple or orders of magnitude
    more complicated. It begins with defining who your customers are or who you perceive
    them to be. If you have designed a Latin/Roman typeface, you can begin with the
    major markets of Europe and the Americas and other European language countries.
    There are a series of template codepages and encodings available [[http://tiro.com/resources.html|here]],
    which you can use if you like. Of course these are start points, and you may decide
    you need a subset of what these provide or a superset. You may decide the naming
    scheme isn't to your liking etc. etc. But there are mechanisms in place to deal
    with that once you've figured them out.\r\n\r\nComplications such as Charles is
    referring to illustrates that \"making a character set\" does not necessarily
    stop at a list of characters, their glyph shapes and their encoding(s). It can
    also involve secondary or tertiary mechanisms to get the text to display as desired.
    This could, as is the case with many North American languages, involve a large
    number of accented characters which do not exist within Unicode as pre-composed
    characters and need to be built up\u2014either with mark positioning and/or with
    composition/decomposition lookups [ccmp]. For myself, I have prioritized development
    of the latter (specifically for Native languages) as I think it has slightly better
    application support then does [mark] (ccmp has support in the last few versions
    of InDesign, as well as Word, Firefox and others). While mark positioning does
    allow for arbitrary accent positioning and stacking, it is more complicated to
    implement in a comprehensive manner. [ccmp] and pre-composed glyphs allows for
    shape and positioning refinement as well as presenting the user with their characters
    in a glyph palette, which I suppose has some advantage. Neither can be discounted
    as a solution.\r\n\r\n-Ross   "

  body: "Hello Charles, when I speak of bases and marks, these are combining marks.\r\nThough
    InDesign claims to support ccmp/mark/mkmk, this rather addresses an expert usage
    as you sketched here and in earlier posts: entering character plus combining mark
    character(s) and have the font do the composition. In contrast, I have 'normal'
    end users in mind who do know really know what 'combining marks' are and just
    type, on their local or maybe an adjusted keyboard, a 'complete' diacritic letter
    -- and the OS/application would internally and invisibly do the actual composition.
    Effectively, for users it would not make a different whether diacritic letters
    are precomposed or composed on the fly. But as said, there is more to it for an
    OS/application than just supporting ccmp/mark/mkmk, like canonical (de)composition,
    canonical mark ordering, etc.\r\nThe goal for a foundry of course is providing
    fonts that just work, rather than handing over a bunch of letter elements from
    which typographers would create the font they need. And I can tell that it is
    highly frustrating to <em>know</em> that setting up mark/mkmk mechanisms can be
    done in very comfortable way e.g. with FLS and the new AFDKO -- yet it is a couple
    of years too early for a font to expect this to work in the 'real world'.\r\n\r\nRoss
    Mills: <cite>Neither can be discounted as a solution.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is it.
    It is both/and rather than either/or (of ccmp and mark). And it should be design
    considerations (which shapes need optical corrections, which don't?) that dictate
    whether mark or ccmp would jump in, rather than compatibility considerations (which
    applications support this or that piece of the OT spec) as you indicate when you
    say,\r\n\r\n<cite>For myself, I have prioritized development of the latter ...
    as I think it has slightly better application support then does [mark] ...</cite>\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I would prefer to challenge application developers rather than comfort them. I
    would like to see results and am bored of being told no and how difficult implementing
    all this is etc. Unicode is established as a standard. OpenType is de facto a
    standard. There is nothing left to argue about.\r\n\r\nCharacter/glyph set and
    layout behavior considerations are part and parcel. It does not make sense any
    more to think of character/glyph set as the basics, and layout behavior as a bonus."
