  was used in World War II Aircraft navigation instruments.  Example is this URL:
  \ [[http://i24.ebayimg.com/01/i/08/c9/47/db_1.JPG|B-17 RECOGNITION LIGHTS]]\r\n\r\n
  \  This was a very common font in World War II and probably was due to some machinery
  that was used to engrave onto the instruments.  If you google \"B-17 Instruments\"
  you'll see this all over:  Always all uppercase, proportionally spaced, sans-serif.
  \  Here is another one from the B-17 Auto-Pilot control [[http://spitfirespares.co.uk/website%20products%2041/auto%20pilot%20b17.jpg|B-17AutopilotPicture]]
  Any help would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nRalfieRoo\r\n"
