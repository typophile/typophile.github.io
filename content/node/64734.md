  body: It was probably custom, but it reminds me of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/folio/extra-bold/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D66%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DHawaii%2520Five-0%25C2%25A0%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D34">Folio
    Extra Bold</a>. If you enlarge the caps, change the dots to ovals, and alter the
    "w" a bit, you will be pretty close.
