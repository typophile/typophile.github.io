body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nMy name is Julian - I'm a final year Graphic Design student
  from AUT university in Auckland, New Zealand (Bachelor Graphic Design). \r\n\r\nFor
  my exhibition project, I am looking into the area of ethics and design. \r\nSpecifically
  targeting the ideas of ethical responsibility to my fellow peers the next generation
  of graphic designers. \r\n\r\nIm looking to form ethical values through narrative.
  Showing through example, (positive and negative) rather than telling people what
  to do. \r\n\r\nTherefore, If anyone has had any experiences on a job where they
  have taken a personal stand in favor of their ethical and moral values, or where
  they have wished they had in hindsight, or even just had a feeling that what they
  were doing was wrong, I'd love to here from you. \r\n\r\nPrivate message, email
  or just reply to me in this thread, I would be extremely thankful for any feedback.
  \r\n\r\nDepending on the story, I would like to conduct an interview in the form
  of an electronic survey (Email) or brief description of the job. These will be used
  on a 'offline' website at the exhibition. I will respect anyones wish to stay anonymous.
  \r\n\r\nOnce again thank-you for helping me spread the idea of responsible ethical
  design, I think this is a very important issue that the next generation of graphic
  designers must be aware of. \r\n\r\nCheers \r\nJulian"

    my opinion, being ethical as a typographer means transmitting the text you are
    communicating as faithfully as possible.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    agree with your opinion on being an ethical typographer. \r\n\r\nAre there any
    projects on which you would refuse to do on the basis of your ethics?\r\n\r\nJulian\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I definitely think its the designers job to educate their clients on ethical
    practices, to research around the area of a particular project and to be responsible
    for the practices involved. Ultimately if you refuse to take a job based on your
    ethical values, surely someone else is just going to pick it up?\r\n\r\nBut at
    the same time I'm sick of seeing weak ethical guidelines full of shoulds. Ultimately
    at the end of the day, under stress and and hardship, ethics are the first thing
    to fly out the window.\r\n\r\nThis leads me back to the basis of my first post.\r\nI
    want to try and promote a set of ethical values (Not Guidlines), in which my peers
    dont think of ethics as limitations or boundaries, but as something that they
    positively incorporate into every project.\r\n\r\nThiis is where my request for
    your stories comes in,\r\nI believe narrative is an excellent way of installing
    values. If people can read about someone else who has sucessfully challenged the
    conventional practise of design, it becomes a whole lot more feasable.\r\nPerhaps
    you stood up in the face of ethical uncertainty, successfully influenced a clients
    unethical practice, or where in hindsight realised that what your were doing was
    wrong.\r\n\r\nI think there is power in these stories for influencing my generation
    (The next generation) of designers. "

    telling everyone else how to live their lives. This includes preachy designers,

    off if people took an introductory course in ethics and developed critical thinking
    skills that can be applied to ethical behavior rather than just listening to other
    designers preach about how we should all behave ourselves."

    practices\"\r\n\r\nIn what context? Are we talking professional ethics? If so,
    then it'd be your job as the designer to adhere to your set of professional ethics
    and the client, theirs. \r\n\r\n\"I\u2019m sick of seeing weak ethical guidelines
    full of shoulds.\"\r\n\r\nWell, the graphic design industry isn't really that
    complex. Not sure how strong of ethical guidelines we need. And aren't all ethical
    guidelines mostly 'shoulds'? At least in the non-life-threatening professions?
    ;o)\r\n\r\nIn terms of educating clients, being a web developer, I've often had
    to do some basic 101 explanations of IP laws, Spam laws, and such. "

  body: "Don't know if this relates to ethics, but I see part of our responsibility
    as designers, in providing a level of craftsmanship that is not necessarily related
    to the demands of a particular client, but are for the betterment of the overall
    field.\r\nIt used to be, that watchmakers would put intricate, elaborate designs
    on the inside surface of the case that no one but the occasional watch repairer
    would be likely to see, for the sole benefit of getting a satisfaction of creating
    a well-crafted thing. This sort of satisfaction in your work, and respect for
    the people who'd come in contact with it could be quite useful in the design field.\r\nThe
    possible ethical implication might be, that we should make sure not to subject
    the public at large to more poorly-make and tasteless solutions.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal
