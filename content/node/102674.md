  body: "Welcome to Typophile - and please try the Type ID board for font IDs, it
    might give you earlier replies :)\r\nI'm not familiar with tatooing, but I thought
    tatoos were usually hand-made. I don't know any exact font match, and the two
    e's are not alike, so I think it's not a font.\r\nAll the same there are 18th
    century handwriting faces along that line. The writing reminded me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/3ip/texas-hero/|Texas
    Hero]], but it's not an exact match, rather perhaps a model for the tatoo studio."
