		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eli, to create a Hebrew grammar font, to use later in Volt, I would create a set of 22 extra glyphs. There are ten nikkud, and a dagesh.</p>
<p>So, if add two more for every one that is there now, 11 + 22 = 33.</p>
<p>They do not need Unicode values. Rather, they can simply be alternative glyphs for each nikkud Unicode value, and the dagesh Unicode value.</p>
<p>If they are placed in the FontLab file in the existing place of a font imported into Volt, adjustments to the total number of glyphs need not be made to the project in Volt, or to the FontLab file.</p>
<p>If they are placed in the FontLab file in the new locations of a font not yet imported into Volt, adjustments to the total number of glyphs need to be made to the project in Volt, and to the FontLab file.</p>
<p>I suggest that the new graphic forms of the nikkud and dagesh symbols be intuitive. Their new form should be similar to their old forms. A kal version should be simply a hollowed version of the nikkud and dagesh; a chazak version should be simply an outlined version of the nikkud and dagesh.</p>
<p>In the case of the already familiar kamatz katan, it should remain the same in its Unicode value location, but have the above appearance in the other locations in the font.</p>
<p>Similarly, I created and placed in my fonts, graphic symbols for the shvah-na: a small floating asterisk used by Lubavitch/Kehos; a small floating rafe-like used by ArtScroll and others; I added the enboldened shva, used by many Sephardim; and the circled asterisk, used by Shai LiMorah publishers.</p>
<p>But this is only for publishing purposes. But the shvah-na should have the above cited appearance in the other locations in the font.</p>
<p>I believe we do not need to create anything more in the FontLab files.</p>
<p>Generate a .ttf font, to use and edit in Volt.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I will post the 22 added glyphs soon.</p>
<p>In the shvah-nach and shvah-na will appear as a regular shvah. Each however will be hollowed for shvah-na, or outlined for shah-nach.</p>
<p>The other graphic symbols are only for printing purposes, as these publishers, Kehot, ArtScroll, Shai L&rsquo;Morah, and others, are used to seeing these images. However, for Hebrew grammar purposes, the other images are to be used.</p>
<p>About automating text with taamei mikra, this is addressed alreay in the furtive patach.</p>
<p>About automating everything, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>At first everything. Later, some fonts will have them not automated by simply creating subsets of the Volt program.</p>

<p>For the hollow forms, I created them in Fontographer very easily, by going to the fourth Element menu from the left, to the fourth entry, Selection Info, and selecting Contour and Fill Properties, and turning off Fill, and clicking Stroke Outline with a 2 setting for the ems.</p>
<p>I could create them as filled outlines by redrawing them.</p>
<p>For the outlined forms, I simply copy and pasted them upon themselves. Then, I picked the Element menu again, and the ninth entry Expand Stroke, and set the Pen Width to 40. Perhaps, it should be 60 or even higher.</p>

<p>First, each nikkud and dagesh must be defined as a Glyph Group by itself.</p>
<p>Second, each kal etc. nikkud and dagesh  must be defined as a Glyph Group by itself, and each chazak etc. nikkud and dagesh  must be defined as a Glyph Group by itself.</p>
<p>Another dagesh symbol is required to represent a mappik. I suggest this is a dagesh outlined with two circles. It must be defined as a Glyph Group by itself, too.</p>
<p>Volt processes earlier GPOS look-ups, and afterwards Volt processes later GPOS look-ups. So, the sequence or order of the GPOS look-ups is important. The order of the Glyph Groups is not important.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, So lets start from the begining.
what are the ingredients that we will need at the font level?
Israel, You are talking about 3 sets od glyphes</p>
<ol>
<li>the normal sheva,qamats,dagesh.</li>
<li>shva-nach,qamats qatan, dagesh kal</li>
<li>sheva na, qamats qatan, dagesh hazak.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will need more than that.
first, a hataf qamats is always qatan, so we need another hatafqamats qatan.
second, in general the shevas of the hatafim are NA, so we need another set of hatafim that have sheva na&rsquo;a attachet to them.</p>
<p>Now will need another set of this glyphes
Sheva NACH, Sheva-NA, Qamats, Qamats Qatan, Dagesh Kal and Dagesh Hazaq
This set of glyphes we need for later use in volt not as mark glyphs but SIMPLE or BASE GLYPHES.</p>
<p>The reason for this is, because i can&rsquo;t sub a mark with mark (shva nach to Na) with PROCESS MARKS = NONE
In cases i want to check words without mark sequence in the context section.
So First i sub the diacritics to their equivlent BASE GLYPHES then in the next lookup I sub the shva na to nach as base glypes
and finally switch them back NA-BASE to NA-MARK and NACH-BASE to NACH-MARK</p>
<p>Until here is every thing clear???</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Now why is this important????
building a project like this will take you to the limits of VOLT&rsquo;s Code block.
it is very important to know how to optimize your project with the least amounts of anchers, kerns, lookups and lines of context.</p>
<p>most projects in other languages can be a bit dirty, they may become complex but do not reach volts limits (not realy Volt&rsquo;s foult but OT)</p>
<p>specially when using context as dictionary.</p>
<p>Word that are built around PAALA פעלה, have a pattern of
<Letter>qamats<letter>sheva<letter>qamats+he
in these cases you will never know if the qamats is qatan and the sheva is nach, or the qamats is gadol and the sheva is na.
unless i have a mapik at the last He or BACHLAM Letters before but plain you can never know.</p>
<p>So&hellip;..
We build a dictionary for known cases
Chochma
Orma
Hogla
hozka</p>
<p>and so on and so on.
doing this with PROCESS MARKS=ALL will jam the intier project</p>

<p>I think they should be standard in Unicode. If they are there, all Jewish publishers will use them in their prayerbooks and Hebrew language primers, plus the Orthodox publishers will start featuring them in their books of Psalms and Pirkei Avot etc., and the secular publishers will feature them in their books of poetry.</p>

<p>In discussing this with John Hedson, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Raphael&rsquo;s experience was because of poorly written code.</p>
<p>What we speaking about: a dozen or two extra glyphs - the same in GPOS look-ups?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Now lets talk abut DAGESHIM.
There are two ways to go about it.</p>
<ol>
<li>using a preset of dagesh kal and a preset of dagesh hazak which ar positioned at the font level.</li>
<li>positioning Dagesh kal and Hazaq with volt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Approach 2 was my approach, because this way the user has full control over the posioning via Indesigns Diacritic Postioning.
But this approach will damnd much more code at the VOLT level.
It also allows me to use a Dagesh hazaq axactly the same as the normal dagesh, for those who don&rsquo;t want the dagesh distinguish but do want the sheva na and qamats qatan
but i still need to know what is dagesh kal and what is hazaq&hellip;</p>
<p>using approach 1, might be better for you. it makes coding life much simpler healtier and happier.</p>
<p>After we make this desitions will talk further.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Now lets examin some of the basic rules of sheva na and nach.
A sheva na continues a sound and a sheva nach stops the sound.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A sheva under the first letter of a word will allways be NA
This sheva is instead of Segol so it sounds Like E
also logical it would be imposible to stop a sound right at the begining of a word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sheva under a letter with a dagesh (any dagesh) Will be a sheva na.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two letters rhe same like bet bet or lamed lamed the sheva under the first letter of the same will be a NA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two shevas one after the other the first will be nach, the second na.
But if the two shevas are at the last two letters of the word then they both are NACH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sheva after a Tenua Qetana Is NACH after Tenua Gedola Is NA.
here is where we have to know if a qamats is tnua gedola or qetana or in other words Qamats rachav Or Qamats Qatan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>here mainly is where a Meteg comes in misuse.
Text use a meteg instead of a mafsiq so meteg is used also for this and also for mileeil and milera.
A qamats with a meteg should be rahav and the coming sheva a NA
with out a meteg the qamats is qatan and the following sheva is nach.
but this is not a ruling rule.</p>
<p>all this about the qamats qatan is very much in general
we will examin qamats qatan more in depth later</p>
<p>there are more rules with taamim
like uf i have a sheva with a taam maamid so even if before i have a tenua gedola the sheva is nach.</p>

But the only two people in the world (to the best of my knowledge) that has tried to do it, haven&rsquo;t managed 100%. Now, it depends on the font.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Raphael,</p>
<p>My goal is to create a 2 different Hebrew grammar &lsquo;program&rsquo;s in Volt.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;program&rsquo;s are identical to each other, except thar one &lsquo;program&rsquo; includes only GSUB look-ups which mark the shvah-na, and the kamatz-katan. This a general purpose &lsquo;program&rsquo;; the results are Volt-generated fonts, in any design, intended to be used commercially by anyone; only the shvah-na, and the kamatz-katan, are displayed, and printed.</p>
<p>The second &lsquo;program&rsquo; includes GSUB look-ups which mark every nikkud and dagesh. This NOT a general purpose &lsquo;program&rsquo;; the results are Volt-generated fonts, in only certain designs, intended to be used educationally by achools (and perhaps publishers of educational books); every nikkud and dagesh, are displayed, and printed.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>You write that there are two opposing factors why this may not work:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are a large number of look-ups which will &lsquo;crash&rsquo; the computer, as every nikkud and dagesh must be compiled for substitutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for Hadasa, Hebrew letters are too narrow to avoid collisions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which it?</p>
<p>It seems that these are two separate issues.</p>
<p>The latter factor seems to an issue which can be addesed in planned out design. Hence, it is not an issue.</p>
<p>The former factor is not substantiated by you, as you can not cite this MicroSoft document. Furthermore, my two Volt experts suggest that there is no upward limit to processing a Volt font in InDesign CS/x ME.</p>
<p>Now, you say, &ldquo;let us see&rdquo;.</p>
<p>===</p>
<blockquote>

</ol>
<p>===</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>it&rsquo;s not used in any other typeface</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why exactly that I am not introducing any new design. A hollow or not filled-in letter is the same design that a person is used to see. But now, it is merely hollow or not filled in.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>it will be impossible to print</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>At small types, like 12 pt and below, this is true for desktop printers. At larger sizes, like 14 pt and larger, this is possible. Try and see for yourself. Highlight some text in InDesign, and apply the Swatches to it in white (paper) near the top of its pop-up window. Then, go to swatches and select the text outline, apply the .5 or .75 pt.. Then, go back to Swatches, and apply black to the text outline. Now print and see.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>it&rsquo;s not intuitive as to what on earth it means</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree. Let us not argue just for argument&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>The design is exactly the same, but hollows for pronouncing or intending differently, or outlined for pronouncing or intending differently.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>It could be useful in a book on Hebrew grammar with the specific words printed at 24pt, but for general purpose use, I&rsquo;m not even sure the point of it.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The Volt fonts intended for ue by everyone are not radically new. The shvah-na and kamatz-katan have been printed in books for over a 100 years, and used by anyone who prays during that time with those books.</p>
<p>There are over 100,000 religious children today who pray daily. Most don&rsquo;t have an inkling how to pronounce differently a shvah-nach and a shvah-na. Isn&rsquo;t it time for something to be done?</p>

<p>&ldquo;E-l lo ah

E-l lo ha - with emphasis on the last syllable, if the dagesh creates an indirect pronoun, 
as in &ldquo;his G-d&rdquo; (if the reference is to the Creator, or to any false god, then it would
be &ldquo;his god&rdquo; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stress is actually on the LO and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;ah&rdquo; with a pronounced &ldquo;h&rdquo;. There are 3 situation when the patach is pronounced before the letter, chet, mapik heh and ayin. So it&rsquo;s poteach, tapuach, mizbeach etc. eloah, yehoshua' (since us Ashkenazim don&rsquo;t pronounce the ayin this is a grammatical curiousity)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are over 100,000 religious children today who pray daily. Most don&rsquo;t have
an inkling how to pronounce&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and many religious adults too!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious. What is the market for this? Before working for Koren I was a commercial typesetter for many Jewish publishing houses in the States. People came to me for my expertise in certain in Hebrew/English typesetting. Whereas I had many requests for h dots, requests for the kamatz katan and shva na were far less. But when they were requested never were they so esoteric and I <em>never</em> had requests for dagesh chazak nor for the matter mileil (which is odd in my opinion). Further, I often typeset transliterated texts which was extremely interesting because it was clear to me that the publishers' Hebrew experts who did the transliteration didn&rsquo;t actually read Hebrew very well.</p>
<p>When I did have requests, if there was an extra cost to the font development, (even to the tune of a few hundred dollars), suddenly it wasn&rsquo;t very necessary.</p>
<p>I understand your mission with these fonts. The idea is great in principle. I doubt the ability to execute this, but putting this aside, what is the commercial point?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Look, isreal, I did not fail, because i never bothered with it.
But lets take a try.</p>
<p>A meteg can be used (besides SofPasuk) For mileeail and Milera or grammer issues.
the reason i did not bother with it is because I would assume that Meteg Like Other nikud are typed.</p>
<p>For mileeil and milera, there are rules, but when in comes to the grammer it cant be done because it goes arround in circles.</p>
<p>Befor any
יך,נו,ני,יני,ינו,ים,הו the letter before allways gets a meteg.
וח,יח with a furtive patah the letter before gets a meteg
now this comes befor anything else.
unlike sheva being checked form the begining of the letter, metegs must be checked back and forth.</p>
<p>any segol befor a finalkaf (+qamats) the segol gets a meteg, a qamats before the finalkaf dows not get a meteg.
a sheva does not get a meteg because it acts mostly as a segol ans is sheva Na.</p>
<p>after a sheva nach the next letter should get a meteg.
normaly a word with 3 letters the first gets a meteg, 4 leter the second gets a meteg
not talking about the above conditions, an we also have to take in consideration Otiiot Mekashrot Like vav bet kaf lamed mem, if they exist in the letter and there are not from the root so the meteg goes one the third letter, the second not counting the Otiiot mekashrot.</p>
<p>Two segols one after the other the first gets a meteg (at a begining of a word).
qamats + qamats if on 3 letters the first gets meteg, if more the second gets the meteg.</p>
<p>these rules generaly work, some of them are absolute others are not.</p>
<p>then you have meteg that comes with a qamats gadol and dose not come with qamats qatan.</p>
<p>again, if text comes with meteg why insert them, if not then you will find your self going in circles trying to figur-out in a lot of cases if a qamats is gadol followed by a sheva NA, or maybe its a qamats Qatan followed by a Sheva Nach.</p>
<p>its possible also with text without teaamim and meteg to come to a high level of distinguish of qamats qatan and gadol, but all the cases Like PAALA you will never figure it out.</p>
<p>if you do, please let me know.</p>

Notice in the preamble to this document that this is a revised proposal: the earlier one suggested a number of different options for handling this encoding, and the UTC came back and asked for the proposers to agree on and recommend a single solution. Notice also that this is a proposal jointly submitted by a number of people, which came about after a lot of discussion sort of like the current discussion on Typophile.</div>

<p>Thank you for the proposal regarding the HOLAM HASER FOR VAV character. Of course, I intend to make my proposal for the shva-na.</p>
<p>The other Hebrew grammar glyphs will simply be two or three alternative glyphs for each existing Unicode values. However, data transfer will work better if an additional Unicode value will be granted for each Hebrew grammar glyph.</p>
<p>If the alternative glyphs are located at the reserved section, will they function from right-to-left?</p>
<p>Rephael, does Koren feature a shvah-na in its siddur? If so, which view do you follow? I assume you follow that which ArtScroll uses.</p>

<p>As typograph and I have tried to tell you, there are many many systems of nikud, all of which are correct (as long as they are consistent throughout a book).</p>
<p>However, in a siddur, you have to employ at least 3 different systems depending on the source of the text, so if the source is from Tanakh, then we employ a different system of shva na, and if it&rsquo;s from the Amoraim, a different system for mileil (meteg). That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t understand how on earth it will help to encode the grammatical rules within a font because the typesetter probably won&rsquo;t be knowledgeable enough to know the source of the different texts and which stylistic set to apply for each sentence in the Siddur.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are two Chabad siddurs.</p>
<p>(1) A newer one from Kehot Israel, based upon the Hebrew grammar rules of the Minchat Shai. This shitah is used by the Shai L&rsquo;Morah publishers; most notably their Chumash. They added the shvah-nah, kamatz-katan, and hataf-kamatz-katan. No one did that before, not even Koren.</p>
<p>(2) The standard Chabad siddur from the USA. It features the shitah of Rabbi Zalman Henna.</p>
<p>I am only aware of 3 views, Rabbi Zalman Henna, the Minchat Shai, and that used by ArtScroll.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Typograph ever suggested that there are others.</p>
<p>It appears that the particular view is ignored. If this is the case, how can there be consistency?</p>
<p>Did you typeset it? Which model did you follow?</p>
<p>Regarding the use of shvah-na in the Tanach, I never saw this in the entire Nach. Shai L&rsquo;Morah publishers only has this in the Haftorahs.</p>
<p>Where did you see the shvah-na in the Tanach?</p>

<p>I think that you are, with all due respect, very mistaken here.</p>
<p>You are clearly a talented typesetter. But you not a grammarian, or even thinking logically. You know a pile of Hebrew grammar, but as they say, a little knowledge is dangerous, because you think you are a Hebrew grammar expert. But you aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If Rabbi Zalman Henna has rules pertaining to shvah-na, kamatz-katan, and meteg, for example, why would I choose to adhere to the Minchat Shai&rsquo;s rules regarding kamatz-katan, and meteg, but adhere to Rabbi Zalman Henna regarding shvah-na?</p>
<p>But if Rabbi Zalman Henna only has rules regarding shvah-na, why would you think that I would fabricate rules regarding kamatz-katan, and meteg, attribute them to him, instead of following a different set of rules regarding kamatz-katan, and meteg?</p>
<p>Sometimes, I think that you don&rsquo;t understand what I want to do in this Volt-created OpenType font.</p>

<p>I could get my grammarians to spend hours on this typographic forum explaining all this to you, or I could get them to work on their projects. I prefer the latter. I also know that they spend many years in Kollel and university studying this so I&rsquo;m guessing that it might take some months to explain to you why you can&rsquo;t do what you insist you can do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the difference. I know my limitations and I hire staff that is more expert than me. Whether it&rsquo;s scripting the typesetting of the project that I&rsquo;m doing now, or deciding whether the word יברכך should have a shva na or nach depending on context.</p>
<p>You on the other hand, want to master all knowledge. I am humbled by your approach to life, but I&rsquo;m a salaried employee and I have to get sifrey kodesh to market!!!</p>

<p>Incorrect.</p>
<p>I consulted two world-class grammarians, retired Professor Aron Dotan, formerly of Tel Aviv University, and Rabbi Shmuel Rabin of Toroto, Canada. I asked them point blank: Is a contextual definition of the shvah-na etc. possible. They both answered &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Plus, Typograph claims that he has done this in Volt already, and has posted a sample text using his Volt created font as proof.</p>
<p>So, who should I believe? World-class grammarians, and one who demonstrates that he has done it. Or your non-world-class grammarians?</p>

<p>This seems illogical. What do you mean by context?</p>
<p>As I understand it, a shvah-na is defined simply by the preceding nikkud etc., and not by its context in a sentence?</p>
<p>Do you mean context in a sentence? Or context in a word segment?</p>
<p>Context in a sentence sheds light on meaning. Context in a word sheds light on its grammar.</p>

<p>When I was a young yeshiva bachur, my teacher, the great Ger Tzedek from Auzzyland, Rabbi Shneur Zalman Gafni Shlita, commonly said:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like water off a duck&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like we Americans regard spilled milk.</p>
<p>For years, I asked myself, what does this mean?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like water off a duck&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, I pictured it, &ldquo;water off a duck&rsquo;s back.&rdquo; Oh, I get it.</p>
<p>Fruitless. It&rsquo;s passed already. Like we Americans regard spilled milk.</p>
<p>What was, was.</p>
<p>Regarding lashon hara, everything you say is correct, especially the last point, which few remember.</p>
<p>The sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe explains. &ldquo;We say that words from the heart enter the heart. Hence, if we rebuke and fail, then the words were not said from the heart, or else the other person would have listened and changed. That means, every wrong-doing that this person does from now on is really your fault. For had the words of rebuke really came from your heart, then they would have been effective, ie. entered the person&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>Read his posts about the meteg. He did say what you are saying here.</p>
<p>He said that the meteg is confused for different symbols, which is why he chose to leave it out.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Hey, GoHebrew, don&rsquo;t put words into my mouth.
I said that i got the project to a very high level of precision.
I do not clain that it can be done to 100%;</p>
<p>With Teamim, I get to 98.8%
Meaning, that from every 1000 cases the font will fail at 2 cases.
without teaamim with meteg, precision level gows down and with text with aout teaamim and meteg precision gows down a little more.</p>
<p>This does not include the fact that i tend to ignore any thing that is in debate.</p>
<p>therefore, the font uses 2 stylistic sets and the ability at the keyboard to correct these cases.</p>
<p>now, here is a basic fundimental logic that i decided from the start.</p>
<p>A Normal qamats in a place that should be a qamats qatan is less of a mistake than a qamats qatan in a place where there should be a qamats gadol.</p>
<p>A Normal Sheva in a place that should be a Sheva na is less of a mistake than a sheva na in a place where there should be a normal sheva (Nach).</p>
<p>let me explain a little more.
Qamats + Hataf Qamats (Like TzoHorayim)
The font uses qamats gadol.</p>
<p>The reason.
According to the Ashkenazim its a qamats qatan(O), According to the Sefaradim it&rsquo;s a qamats gadol (A).</p>
<p>So the font does nothing;</p>
<p>Volt you can never know what is SHEM TOAR or SHEM ETSEM and what is the SHORESH.
In volt you cant build a data base to lookup from.</p>
<ul>
<li>alot of decisions were simply made bt searching all the tanakh and determening wrather a certain check will result with the least mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>then if the mistakes were&rsquo;nt to many, i add them into a dictionary.</p>
<p>a lot of assumtions are made.
like he+qamats followed by Alef,He,Het,Ayin.
i would assume that this qamats should realy be Patach, But because of TASHLUM DAGESH it became Qamats. So this qamats is gadol and not qatan.</p>
<p>so if by checking this i resolve nost cases, and have a couple cases that fails in EYOV, So i do that, and either i ignore the mistakes or look them up in a dictionary.</p>
<p>Then you have also matters to do with MASORET.</p>
<p>So again, my project is 99.8% with idle text, but never 100%.</p>
<p>insetion of meteg by volt is hardly possible.</p>
<p>the absolute conclusion is:
sheva na-nach, qamats gadol-qatan is 90% contextual. but not fully contextual.
no matter what Pro.Dotan or Rabbi Shmuel Rabin tell you (if they toled you so).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I diagree.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The function of a kamatz gadol and kamatz ketan is a grammar issue.
Saying (O) or (A) is cultural pronunciation.</p>
<p>For example, 
the first word of kiddush on riday night is the word in Hebrew for day, &lsquo;yom&rsquo;.
Litvish Jews (whose families came from Lithuania) pronounce this word as &lsquo;yaym&rsquo;, as if the cholam was not there, and instead a tzayrei appears under the aleph.
But nothing is really different. And the spelling and nikkud remain the same.</p>
<p>In the recital of kaddesh, many Jews (except Lubavitchers and Sephardim, who say, &lsquo;Amen&rsquo;) repeat the phrase, &lsquo;may He be blessed&rsquo;, &lsquo;breech hu&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hungarian Jews, though, say &lsquo;breech hee&rsquo;, as if the vav (shuruk) was not there, and instead a chirik appears under the hei.
But nothing is really different. And the spelling and nikkud remain the same.</p>
<p>Rule:</p>
<p>Pronunciation is cultural, and does not affect the rules of Hebrew grammar.
Hebrew grammar is not affected by Ashkenazic or Sephardic customs or stlyes.</p>

what ever is in dabate, i leave to the user to decide, and even if he did not make a any choice, still a qamats gadol in the place of qatan is less a mistake than a qamats qatan in a place where there should be a qamats gadol.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>you know what Gohebrew, I&rsquo;ll give you another example of debate.</p>
<p>words like
המלמד, המכסה, המעורר
ect'</p>
<p>The He (The first He) is HE HAYEDIA With a patah
the second letter is any letter who can get a dagesh but has no dagesh.
There is a grammer rule that says that the latter after the He Hayedia should be with a dagesh, and a letter with a dagesh and a sheva the sheva is NA.</p>
<p>Another rule says, that a sheva after a tenua ketana is a Sheva Nach.
But a word with a dagesh even if it is after a tenua ketana the sheva is NA.</p>
<p>So here is a debate.
In theses cases there is no dagesh in the second letter and comes after tenua ketana.
is this sheva NA??? because of the dagesh that was supposed to be there or we go after the tenua ketana and then the sheva is NACH.</p>
<p>Well, My Project does not make any decision, and leaves the sheva as is, and allows the user to decide.</p>
<p>And again you have things to do with MASORET</p>
<p>So you see, you cant have the font making all the decisions without allowing the user ever ro decide.</p>
<p>you absolutly have to allow the user to the posibility to do what he thinks is right according to his SHITA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole point of an intelligent OpenType font properly in Volt allows thee user &gt;never to decide anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gohebrew, What amaizes me with you is that as one who has absolutly no knoledge of hebrew grammer will be the one to decide what should be and without allowing the user to have his say in the matter.</p>
<p>and who says that &ldquo;The whole point of an intelligent OpenType font properly in Volt allows the user never to decide anything.&rdquo;???? You????
where did you get that conclusion from????</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are following logic. I am following rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What rules???? Whos rules???? do you even know the rules?????
I woulde believe that your only knolegde in the matter, is the knoledge you got from this threads and other threads here on typophile.</p>
<p>you argue with me as an equal, but your not. and you are starting to get on my nerves.
i fill like i am talking to a wall.
I try to explain to you different matters in detail, but you don&rsquo;t want to listen and continue to persist with this idea witch is simply not true.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who should I believe?
The world-class experts, or
the whipper-snapper?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The correct ansawr is B) the whipper-snapper.
I don&rsquo;t believe that any of these experts actualy toled you that it is 100% posible, or its 100% contextual&hellip; ask them again in detail.</p>
<p>but when i say &ldquo;the absolute conclusion is:&hellip; &hellip;&rdquo; i believe that 100%</p>
<p>Now, if you stop arguing and start listening and asking you might just learn somthing after all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David,</p>
<p>This was the question that Prof. Dotan thought about, after I emailed him various samples:</p>
<p>I asked: &ldquo;There is a new font technology for computers. It is very advanced, and can be programmed before the users uses it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can take a string of text, with nikkud etc., and replace it with a different string of text, with nikkud etc. I seek to program the font to include replacements with a shvah-nah. Is this contextual replacement possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered: &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Then, he added: &ldquo;You must understand very well the relationship in the nikkud. It&rsquo;s all in nikkud&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I understand his words to refer to the different grammatical rules of the different types of nikkud, including the different types of dagesh.</p>
<p>Each thing builds upon another.</p>
<p>The shvah-na and shvah-nach is after the kamatz-katan and kamatz-gadol. The latter is in turn after the other types of nikkud and dagesh.</p>
<p>I have been taught the rules the rules of the various kind of meteg. So, I can not place it in the scheme of things.</p>
<p>I no longer see that the needed Glyph Groups contain all the different sequences. I now see that the needed Glyph Groups can merely contain a few dozen very small variables.</p>
<p>To get this info, I must pull the last tooth from the one-tooth monster, called David. And I am not a dentist.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill,</p>
<p>Basically, how is it 100% automatic?</p>
<p>My Volt font compiles whatever vocalized Hebrew text in that font by replacing each nikkud and dagesh with either of two types of nikkud and dagesh. Then, it inserts the shva-na and kamatz-katan as required. Then, it replaces each changed nikkud and dagesh (except for the shva-na and kamatz-katan).</p>
<p>Very simple.</p>
<p>I thank Eli and David, for from their words I derived the above formula.</p>
<p>Bill, your questions and Raphael&rsquo;s remarks was like the teaching in Avot about how the teacher learns more from the students' questions than from anything else. Why? Questions and statements cause the teacher to think again, and to rethink a lot. Hence, their questions cause his greatest learning.</p>

then, we (after we determine what causes a meteg) insert accordingly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oy, GoHebrew, you are missing such fundamental points of this argument that you are driving everybody nuts. Let me try and clarify.</p>
<p>Yes, you can probably create a font that puts in kamatz katan and shva na <em>according to Prof Dotan&rsquo;s view</em>.</p>
<p>But you <em>keep</em> missing the following point: NOT ALL TEXT FOLLOWS PROF DOTAN&rsquo;S VIEW OF NIKUD.</p>
<p>You ask how is modern Hebrew grammar different from the grammar of Tanakh? BINGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>YES IT&rsquo;S DIFFERENT.</p>
<p>And the grammar of the Amoraim is different from the grammar of Modern Hebrew (by modern I mean the past few hundred years).</p>
<p>And not only are they different, but in each period there are different opinions.</p>
<p>You got confused with צהריים, thinking we are talking about pronunciation. NO WE ARE NOT. The pronunciation of the kamatz katan is irrelevant to this conversation. We are talking about GRAMMAR. According to the Sepharadi view, their Masorah is that the first kamatz under the tzadi is a kamatz gadol and according to the Ashkenazi view it&rsquo;s a kamatz katan.</p>
<p>Now Prof Dotan doesn&rsquo;t care about the Sepharadi masora because he knows that the masora is based on mistake that the Scholars of that time made (around 300 years ago) due to the information that they had. In his opinion, this is irrelevant and therefore not a problem. For him, it&rsquo;s a kamatz katan. Prof Dotan also doesn&rsquo;t care about a masorah that we have about pronouncing Hebrew in the siddur according to the time period of the Amoraim and Tanakh. He is a Prof of Modern Hebrew grammar.</p>
<p>Prof Dotan isn&rsquo;t wrong, it&rsquo;s just that you didn&rsquo;t ask him the right questions because your knowledge of the subject is too limited to even know to ask the questions.</p>
<p>Does that clarify things a little?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, Raphael, thank you for your opinion of Prof. Dotan&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p>Since you say there are differences in Hebrew grammar in the current modern period, in Hebrew grammar in an earlier Amoraic period, perhaps also in Hebrew grammar in an even earlier Mishnaic period, and even a very early Biblical period.</p>
<p>Please show me some examples.</p>
<p>When the Radak defined Hebrew grammar, which period was he referring to?</p>
<p>If Prof. Dotan was referring to Hebrew grammar in the current modern period, less the Sephardic masorah, why did Rabbi Rabin concur with his conclusion, as he is a Lubavitcher baal-koreh, reader of the Torah scroll on the Sabbath for the congregation, when speaking to another Lubavitcher (and we know little about modern Hebrew grammar)?</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t fall into a Christian-like trap of accepting things with blind faith, please show me some examples of the differences between the seemingly different Hebrew grammars.</p>

<p>But.. the Haredim don&rsquo;t follow the academys conclusions. they hav a masoret, and each one has is own masoret the sefaradim and ashkenazim.</p>
<p>I as a type designer, developed the project to give service to them with respect for each ones masoret from the one hand, and maximum precision on the other hand.</p>
<p>I do not have the pretension of deciding in these matters and especially not coming out and saying that the rules that i put in are to be studied as Hloche Lemoyshe Misinay with no ability of correction because it is carved in stone.</p>
<p>Now letes say that Gohebrew will succseed of doing this 101% according to Pro.Dotan, to others it will not be even 90% correct.</p>
<p>I worked hard to figur out a balance for an efficient help-tool and accuracy
I might be arrogant when i say that in a dabte with Pro.Dotan on this particular erea(if there is one), I do acualy know what i am talking about.</p>
<p>But it seems, that the only way to learn this, is by experiencing for him self.</p>

<p>Gohebrew, how well do you know Indesign???
Turning From OpenType To Normal effcts only MARK Feature not Any SUB Feature, if you are talking about the diacritic postioning.</p>
<p>Now let say that you allow it in a stylistic set.
If the user is using Character Styles the unchecking the stylistic set will turn off the grammer.</p>
<p>But if the user is working with Paragraph Styles then highlighting and unchecking theat stylistic set is no good, because in paragraph style it will turn the feature off for the intier paragraph and not the selected text.</p>
<p>Plus, You want to give the option of Forcing a sheva na\nach Qamats Gadol\qatan ect'</p>
<p>Thats in my case, in your case you are going to have 3 sets of glyphs for Normal sheva, a Sheva NA and Sheva NACH, turning off the stylistic set will result with 3 sets of shevas in one text
The Sheva NA
The Sheva Nach
And then the normal Sheva</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/truth-falsehood_6383.jpg]</p>
<p>By the truth  א  מ  ת  EMET, matters are true, through and through, from beginning to end, and in the middle. The Hebrew word for truth, א  מ  ת  EMET, contains three letters:
the first letter, ALEPH א ל ף , at the beginning of the word, TAF ת , at the end of the word, and MEM מ , at the end of the word.
When is it true? When matters are true, through and through, from beginning to end, and in the middle.
Look, each letter&rsquo;s design is standing strong.</p>
<p>The opposite is true of falsehood, something is false and untrue.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eli,</p>
<p>There are 3 OT fonts with identical Volt code. Only the FontLab fonts and nikkid etc glypks differ.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One font is NO for Nothing - all nikud is normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One font is RB for Rabbinic - all nikud is hollow and outlined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One font is MD for Modern - all nikud is hollow and outlined.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The three fonts appear in a sub-menu, under one font name in the InDesign font menu.</p>
<p>2 and 3 differ slight in the different GSUB look-ups - RB has a few GSUB look-ups that MD does not, and vice-versa. And in Glyph Groups too.</p>
<hr>
<p>The free font set for schools will feature a new version of Hadasa, called GH Friedlander, designed by me. A commercial license for publishers will be sold. A school extended site license will be available to teachers, parents, and students to use at school for a nominal fee for #2 and #3; #1 will cost higher.</p>
<hr>
<p>To summarize, there is a 3 font set.</p>
<p>The logic for the whole system I extrapolated from your conversion of all shvahs to shvah-nachs. I am not doing that neccessarily,l but the concept intrigued me.
And from what you said that somethings causes other things.
Hence, sequence of the GPOS look-ups was crucial.</p>
<p>I think kamatz (4) comes before dagesh (2).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>GoHebrew:
First let me say that this issue (Tenua Kala) you can never check in a volt project (although there are some indications to it)</p>
<p>The definition of Tenua Kala is found in some traditional books.
todey they tend to call it &ldquo;SHEVA MERACHEF&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any how, What is a Tenua Kala????</p>
<p>Definition:
Any Sheva that is supposed to be a Sheva Na, but there is a sheva na after it, this sheva becomes a Tenua Kala and the following Sheva is Nach.
lets take the word מלך
when in plural we say מלכים
The sheva under the first mem is a sheva na
but when we say מלכי
the this sheva (under the mem) becomes patah and the sheva under the lamed is nach.
(we cant have 2 shevas in a row at the begining of a letter)</p>
<p>The difference between A Tenua Ketana And Kala is
That rhe sheva nach after the tenua ketana makes the following BEGED KEFET with a dagesh.</p>
<p>After a tenua kala the BEGED KEFET in most cases will be without a dagesh.
This theory of Tenua Kala tries to explain why a letter after a sheva nach is without a dagesh</p>
<p>And i call it THEORY</p>
<p>This issue there is a huge debate if the there is such a thing as Tenua Kala.
some medakdekim screem against this.</p>
<p>however, The hebrew academy calls this SHEVA MERACHEF.</p>

<p>my knoledge of hebrew grammer is very basic and limited.
I know what i have to know to do the VOLT project
but here you are getting into hebrew grammer in general.
I think David Hamuel is the one to ask, when it comes to hebrew grammer in general.</p>

<p>You write:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what i have to know to do the VOLT project, but here you are getting into hebrew grammer in general. I think David Hamuel is the one to ask, when it comes to hebrew grammer in general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My purpose too is to create a versatile Volt program, whose code can be used elsewhere. Apparently, the contextual analysis Volt program that I seek to create is different than yours.</p>
<p>The structure of my program is clear to me, thanks to things that you and David have said. I am working now on the sequence of GSUB look-ups, as one factor causes another, and then when the second factor is substituted, it causes a third thing, and so on. As I understand better your concise words and examples and those of David, I will be able to determine the necessary sequence.</p>
<p>David, can you explain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the differences between:
a) תוצאהן results,
b) התחלפותן exchanges,
c) השתנותן changes?&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You know gohebrew, there is acouple of things i do&rsquo;nt understand about what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>you want to hav a font absolutly analyzing sheva na\nach qamats gadol\qatan + inserting metegs in the text.</p>
<p>now MIMA NAFSHACH, If your text includes teammim and metegs, why try insert them.
and if we are talking about text with nikud only, then how will you know how to put the metegs in????</p>
<p>You see, my project is built for the worst scenario.</p>
<p>the best scenario = text + teamim (Like in a tanach.)</p>
<p>the seconf best scenario = text without teamim but with metegs and nikud (like in a sidur.)</p>
<p>the worst scenario = text with plain nikud no teamim and no metegs.</p>
<p>now, when you say that there are absolut rules you are saying that typesetters are no longer needed, because the font can do it all, but that is absolutly not true.
ask any serious type setter like rephael freeman.</p>
<p>you see, that the font does its basic function on the worst scenario, then i can add functions in stylistic sets, so the user can define for the font what kind of text we are talking about. if its a text with teamim, meteg+nikud or nikud only, the i can make different assumptions. Likewise i can have different stylistic sets activating this way or the other different issues regarding the ashkenazi or sefaradi SHITOT to some degree.</p>
<p>Text with out MAKAFIM, I can never realy know (unless i use dictionaries) if the qamats before the last letter is a qatan, How will i know what is Be&rsquo;Smichut and whats not???</p>

<p>Now, RESULTS, EXCHANGES and CHANGES have nothing to do with contextual lookups.
this is phisicly to do with how one will type in the text+nikud.
if the word has a patah instead of a sheva, or segol instead of a qamats or a qamats qatan instead of a holam, that has nothing todo with VOLT, after they are correctly typed, VOLT can try analyzing different things, Volt CAN NOT decide how to MENAKED the text.</p>

how to tie your shoes, and raise your hand before you go wee-wee.
come on.</p>
<p>first you must know what volt can do and how it does it, and what it can not do.</p>
<p>then you define your goal within what volt can do and how.</p>
<p>then you draw a blueprint&hellip;a plan that volt can execute
this is what i mean by structure.
first, a building goes up with only a structure.
no pipes, no walls. no closets&hellip;</p>
<p>to answer your mimah nafshach, there are 5 or more similar programs and fonts for all the possibilities that you mentioned.</p>

<p>mimah nefshach:
Do you know what they are to say &lsquo;nothing to do&quot;? If so, explain them.
If you don&rsquo;t know what they are, how can you say &lsquo;nothing to do&quot;?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you hear for the first time a grammer concept and immediately assume that there are strict rules.</p>

<p>Again, why not? Hebrew is super-logical. It was created by G-d. So, it must follow rules.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>but before you are clear on the grammer, i find it hard to believe that you can phisicly be clear on the program structure.</p>

<p>Why? Any architect thinks this way. G-d thought this way when He created heaven and earth. In software development, this called systems development, or at a higher level, it is called systems analysis.</p>
<p>now i have but 2 or 4</p>
<p>GHB (font_name) Reg
GHB (font_name) Bold</p>
<p>B is for Biblical Hebrew = everything</p>
<p>GHE (font_name) Reg
GHE (font_name) Bold</p>
<p>E is for Enhanced = everything - taam</p>
