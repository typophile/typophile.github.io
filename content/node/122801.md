  San serif, pointing to an example using Gotham as something she likes. Problem is,
  the letters in \"GOOD\"  are all very similar looking.\r\nSo any suggestions from
  the typophiles? Your advice is usually bang on :)\r\nI think if I could find a nice
  \"G\" I'm most of the way there.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    a good solution like that, but you can also present other ideas. I love it when
    a client says \"your idea looks better\". "
