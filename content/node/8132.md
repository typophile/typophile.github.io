body: I&#39;m looking for a nice, calligraphic font with a double storey g. Kind of
  like <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/robcooper/signature.shtml"
  target="_blank"> Signature</a> but less jarring. I wish <a href="http://www.p22.com/sherwoodtype/avocet.html"
  target="_blank"> Avocet</a> had a double storey g, that&#39;d be perfect. I may
  use it anyway, but thought I&#39;d ask for suggestions. Thnx for yer help!
