  letter print on the wall; <em>Helvetica Forever</em>, <em>The Living Alphabet</em>,
  and a pile of Emigres (Issue 32 on top) on the table (along with others in the stacks
  I don't recognize).\r\n\r\nGood books and good lights, together.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcs"

    but I cannot exactly recall what it was. Surely it wasn't some Adobe specimen
    book from the late 80s?"

  body: Do you know who makes that alphabet print or where it can be purchased?  I
    tried searching for it with the title you have given, but I can't seem to find
    it anywhere.  Thanks!
