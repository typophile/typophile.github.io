  an existing font and I have to insert some new glyphs that I should recall by a
  key combination (like \"mblogo\"), is it possible? How can I do that?\r\n\r\nI use
  FontLab Studio 5.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nSorry for my english!\r\n\r\nStefano"

  body: "Piece of cake.\r\nYou <em>do</em> need to add some OpenType magic to the
    font, though.\r\n\r\nUsing 'liga' code for ligatures:\r\n\r\n<code>feature liga
    {\r\n # Latin\r\n   sub T e s t by T_e_s_t;\r\n} liga;</code>\r\n\r\nIf the program
    you are using supports ligatures, typing \"Test\" will automatically be changed
    to my quick-and-dirty \"Test\" glyph:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ligatures_4216.PNG]\r\n(Left
    is Ligatures Off, right is On.)\r\n\r\nOf course, you are free to use any of the
    other OTF features, if you don't want to mess with 'standard' ligatures (e.g.,
    put them in a stylistic set or in 'calt' -- contextual ligatures). Use the Opentype
    feature preview in FontLab to check if it works.\r\n\r\nI don't think the sequence
    \"mblogo\" could pop up in the middle of a regular English word. However, if you
    need to use a phrase that <em>can</em>, either don't use ligatures (as these are
    usually 'on' for all text), or check the OTF Feature File description on how to
    limit it to a single word. (Sorry -- can't recall, altho' I used to be able to
    recite it from memory.)\r\n\r\nIt is considered 'proper usage' if your new glyph
    name is composed of the singular characters that make it up, separated by underscores.
    I think this is best seen in PDFs; selecting and copying the \"Test\" glyph yields
    the <em>plain text</em> \"Test\" again. You can also search a PDF for 'test',
    and it'll find both variants."

  body: To make it easy on yourself, throw a symbol into the string you use for replacement.
    Something like "=mblogo=" (The lookups use character names, so that would be "equal
    m b l o g o equal") will protect you from unforeseen surprises if you ever have
    to write about something like "tourismblogoftheday.com".
