  body: "This style reminds me of the work of Emily Connors, whose foundry called
    Emily Lime has issued a number of delightful scripts that are showing up a lot
    these days. She does her s's this way. See [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emily-lime/carolyna/?refby=bowfin|Carolyna
    Pro]] for the most similar style she has released. \r\n\r\nOnce again, I agree
    with Ryuk that this is probably hand-drawn, but I am trying to contact Emily Connors
    to see if she does this sort of thing as custom work.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
