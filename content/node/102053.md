  appreciated.\r\n"

      our manuals there are mostly black and white line drawings.\r\n\r\nJamseM, \r\nYou
      are probably right, but before that I would like to gather some information
      and thoughts so I have a better understanding in discussions with a designer.\r\n\r\nJ.
      Tillman,\r\nThe intended use is printed manuals. They will be available on our
      website as a pdf file but the users will probably print the anyway.\r\nWe use
      the latest Indesign version to produce the manuals.  "

    you don't mind a suggestion, you might consider getting a graphic designer to
    help out; someone who has experience working on technical manuals and has good
    examples of them in their portfolio (not all designers like those kinds of technical
    projects). \r\n\r\nThey could help present the information clearly and in a more
    visually interesting manner. Well designed manuals would be appreciated by your
    customers and would reflect well on your company."

    is if you are making a printed manual or a pdf manual for viewing on screen. And
    if your software will allow this type of font. (Madcap Flare does not work with
    OpenType Postscript flavor fonts.)\r\n\r\nWhat software are you using and what
    outputs do you envision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For a technically-oriented manual I'd be inclined to go for something conservatively
    plain and unobtrusive, with well-disambiguated characters (e.g. no O/0 or 1/l/I
    confusion) that nonetheless reads fairly comfortably.\r\n\r\nIf, as Hrant suggests,
    you don't want to spend money, there are some good free (open source) options.
    \ To name three: <a href=\"http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=1&L=1\">Linux
    Libertine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/schola/index_html\">TeX
    Gyre Schola</a> (a version of Century Schoolbook), or <a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/charter/\">Bitstream
    Charter</a>.  I imagine any one of those would do well.\r\n\r\nGeorgia might work
    well too, although if your manual makes heavy use of tabular numbers you might
    find the old-style figures awkward.  (Though there are ways around that, of course.)"

    can do very nice work, with a surprising tonal range, using the following:\r\n\r\nCalibri\r\nConsolas\r\n\r\nThat's
    for the body copy (Calibri) and the technical data (Consolas).\r\n\r\nFor making
    nicer headlines, you can go to Lucasfont and license a single weight of The Sans.\r\n\r\nIt's
    one big Lucas de Groot family!"
