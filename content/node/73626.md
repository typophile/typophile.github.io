    some details don't match."

  body: I thought it might be Caslon Graphique but the hairlines are too thin. Maybe
    custom drawn anyone?

  body: Huzzah! Is it just me, or is this treatment of Grouch actually much more attractive
    than the somewhat chunky original?

  body: "My thoughts as well, NJ. \r\n\r\nIt would never occur to me to stroke a typeface
    this way -- that the results look so good, and so refined, comes as a surprise.
    \r\n\r\nI will say this for Grouch: it looks very good (and not at all chunky)
    at smaller sizes."
