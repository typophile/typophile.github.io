  I cringed a little, it got me to thinking this would be the place to ask.\r\nWithout
  knowing anything about it, I tend to want to bring the letters together like this:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anna_kern_6568.gif]\r\n\r\nIs
  there a rule? Or is the original OK?"

    at, so a headline will probably need tighter kerning than body copy. At the scale
    it is showing on my screen I would say your \"as\" is okay but the apostrophe
    should move slightly to the right. Given the tightness of Alterations, the a\u2019s
    does leap out but you shouldn't hide the meaning just because it looks ugly.\r\nTim"

    eye. \r\n\r\nIt seems quite a few apostrophe's display poorly to my eye. Can kerning
    pairs withing the font contain an apostrophe? "

  body: "As I understand it, you can set the kerning pair for apostrophe+s (or any
    other) and you could set pairs up for a-z+apostrophe although if you set the sidebearings
    well on the apostrophe you shouldn't need to do all of them. But even so one can
    only do an optimum spacing for a perceived use, so a display face might be tighter
    than a text face, but if you use a text face at a large size you should bear that
    in mind.\r\nTim"
