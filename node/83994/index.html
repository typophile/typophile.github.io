I'm trying to create a handwritten font based on an existing one but because it's the very first time I'm doing it I need some advice of experts... And also I'm trying to find out not only the best font editor but also the most user friendly and easy to use/learn.

I hope to hear from you guys! Any help will be appreciated, Thanks!</div>

yeah... Actually I've already installed Fontographer bojev just because it's an open source software, but it seems to have all the functionalities to build a proper font which is great! On my research I found a lot of font editors and someone in an article said that fontographer is very similar to Fontlab Studio which costs $649! What do you reckon? Do you agree with this? Just because at the moment I can't afford Fontlab... Well I'll give fontographer a try during the weekend and let's see what happens!
By the way Stephen I'm using Mac

Massive thank you to both of you!</div>

<cite>i think Fontforge is software-libre (gpl-compatible), not open-source</cite>

Unfortunately, people will continue to call Linux an open-source operating system... <em>and</em> they will continue to call it Linux instead of GNU/Linux too.

It is true that the term "open-source" is sometimes applied also to software that is not free software, that is not under the GNU or BSD licenses - where the source is visible in a "look-but-don't-touch" fashion. But the basic thing here is that while GNU has proposed some alternative vocabulary, it hasn't really caught on, and so I can't recommend using their terminology if you want to be readily understood by the largest possible audience.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It depends on what you mean by "all letters and punctuation," what quality level is desired, and how experienced you are.

There is a big learning curve on doing this well. Proper outline construction is complicated. Spacing can also be very tricky. If your handwriting font has connecting letters, spacing is much easier, but getting connections right is equally challenging.

At the extremes, there are a few people who can do a basic English alphabet, numerals and basic punctuation (70-80 glyphs) in  maybe two hours—usually with all sorts of tricks and automation assistance—and people who have taken several person-years to do the same.

I expect that my speed is a bit more average. I can prototype a design with that same minimal character set in maybe 12-20 hours. But that's not anything I would ship, either in terms of quality or character set completeness. Getting something polished and complete can easily run into months... or years. Hypatia Sans took five years for the upright and another three for the italics, though most of that was not full time. Slimbach spent some 15 years on Garamond Premier, though also not full time.

Thomas my only experience is the one I have from the university so... is nothing to be honest. I want to create something good and I'm doing a lot of investigation about this subject and to be honest I'm getting really excited! I would like to show you the font when I finish it, just to have your honest opinions.

re: Convert Mac fonts to PC

You should have started with a new message instead of tagging your request onto an un-related year-old post.  However:

First, check your EULA's to see which of your fonts, if any, can legally be converted.

There are many FREE ways to convert your fonts.
You didn't say what kind of fonts they were (Type 1, Truetype, Opentype) and in what format (Macs seem to have multiple ways to store fonts) OR which platform(s) you have available to do it yourself.  For OLDER Mac-only Truetype, there's a free  converter called ttconvert. Google for it.

OR, here are two websites that offer font transformations:

Thanks for the response and pardon me for violating protocol. Actually, I have no idea. The person who created it, a monk in France, forwarded the files to me, but they're Mac. They have no file extensions and he simply recommended that I use Fontographer 5. I can email them to you if you wish.

Cheers! </div>
