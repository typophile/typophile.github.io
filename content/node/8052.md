body: Hi <BR>I&#39;m having problems on generating a Type1 font in fontographer. I
  can&#39;t get the suitcase with the bitmaps inside? Everytime I generate as Type1
  there is just the PostScript Icon. But when I generate a TT font there is no problem.
  Could anyone help me out here?

  body: Make sure that when you do &#34;Generate Font Files&#34;, you choose &#34;NFNT&#34;
    for the &#34;Bitmap font to output&#34; and include a menu name, ID &#40;any number
    below 16000 will do&#41; and at least one size under &#34;Bitmap sizes to output&#34;.
    This last part is particularly important. If you do not specify a size, it will
    not generate a bitmap font or suitcase, no matter what the other settings are.

  body: No, not for Macintosh Type 1 fonts. Some people find uses for them though,
    and, if you plan to market it, some distributors require them.
