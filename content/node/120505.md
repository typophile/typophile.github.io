  body: "Expressa works if the poster actually post-dates 1974 (when E&F designed
    the typeface; not sure I trust the copyright). Otherwise, woodstock is more likely
    ITC Bauhaus Heavy, with some customization:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-bauhaus/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bauhaus_5551.png]"

  body: <a href="http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/31468/burko">Burko</a> is a likely
    candidate as it was released before 1970.

  body: "Thanks for the history lesson, Stephen. \r\n\r\nIf I had been paying attention,
    I'd have noticed that ITC Bauhaus didn't come on the scene until 1975. Its precursor\u2014Herbert
    Bayer's Universal\u2014had been around since the 1920s, though.\r\n\r\nBurko looks
    good for both weights."
