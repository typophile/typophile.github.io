  body: Thank you for helping and it is maybe a bit similar but still not like the
    logo the O looks quite different for example.

    so the most likely clue to find the original font."

  body: "I'm sorry, I don't know any font with such a /O but I can't state it's custom
    made. May be it is as simple as \"generic extended sans like Helvetica/Akzidenz
    Grotesk with a custom /O\".\r\nWhat I can propose though:\r\n- the logo itself,
    freely available to download as vector: http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/only-denim\r\n-
    some similars: [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/the-foundry-typefaces/sans/params/foundry-monoline-12|Foundry
    Monoline]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/neo-gram/|NeoGram]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/sui-generis/|Sui Generis]] (which comes
    very close, for the /NLY part at least), [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100041|Forza]]\r\n-
    a possible track to follow: have a closer look to the /\xAE (register mark), the
    external circle and /O look like to share the same design. /R reminds me once
    again of [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/the-foundry-typefaces/sans/params/foundry-monoline-12|Foundry
    Monoline]]. So my last call: custom job based on Monoline."
