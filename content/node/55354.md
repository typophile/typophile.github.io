  was walking down the sidewalk at a Mardi Gras parade and this sign stopped me in
  my tracks. I apologize for the photo quality; it's from my cell phone. This sign
  breaks the first four typographic guidelines:\r\n\r\n1: <strong>\"For optimum legibility,
  choose classical, time-tested typefaces with a proven track record.\"</strong> Comic
  Sans?!\r\n\r\n2: <strong>\"Be mindful not to use too many different typefaces at
  any one time.\"</strong> I count four.\r\n\r\n3: <strong>\"Avoid combining typefaces
  that are too similar in appearance.\"</strong> The \"Chicken Sandwich\" font is
  different from the Comic Sans used for \"Vege-Burgers,\" but it looks pretty similar.\r\n\r\n4:
  <strong>\"Text set in all capital letters severely retards reading. Use upper- and
  lower-case letters for optimum readability.\"</strong> There are some lowercase
  letters, but I think the design would still benefit from less uppers. "

    who knows where the apostrophe goes in the possessive of <em>New Orleans</em>,
    and who knows there's no apostrophe in the plural of <em>Bloody Mary</em>.</li>\r\n<li>That
    same person knows how to use the serial comma.</li>\r\n<li>Somewhere in New Orleans,
    there's a bar with a laundromat in it.</li>\r\n"
