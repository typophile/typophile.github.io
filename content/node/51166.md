  Increase the horizontal stroke weight by 20 em and the vertical by 4 \u2013 6 em.\r\n\r\n2.
  Then (as the diagonal strokes will be made too thick) make another intermediate
  weight by increasing both horizontal and vertical strokes by 4 \u2013 6 em and use
  it to replace the very thick diagonal strokes from step 1?\r\n\r\n"

    to your search, you will find plenty of material. or you might start with the
