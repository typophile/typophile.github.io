    So if you want a 6-page accourdion fold every page would be 99 x 210 mm.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

  body: "i dont know what i was thinking really\r\ni read somewhere the page fold
    should be around 3mm addition to each page larger than the next but that was for
    Roll or barrel folds.\r\nand not accordion folds.\r\n\r\nthanks. :/"

  body: "Hello,\r\nsorry Ralf and Grot but battlefield has  a valid question, to layout
    a 6 page z fold you need to take into account the folds, as a rough guide the
    cover page(s) should be 2-3 mm bigger than the middle page(s) which should be
    2-3 mm bigger than the last page(s). \r\nIt all depends on the weight of your
    paper stock. \r\nHowever depending upon  how well you get on with your printer
    and depending upon your design you may not have to worry too much about this as
    they may handle the imposition for you.\r\n A word of warning, this can lead to
    changes in your design as the printer will likely just stretch or shrink your
    page to fit. Its better to set it all up your self as one large image as oppose
    to 6 separate pages.\r\ncheers\r\nmartin\r\nps one last thing  A4 is 297mm x 210
    mm so the question is is each page A4 or is the document size A4 in total?"

  body: "Accordion means every page is folded the opposite direction compared to the
    previous, right?  I would ask the printer for the exact measurements if you are
    making a fold where the pages are turned the same direction. I could guess the
    thickness affects very much to how much extra you\u2019re going to need."

  body: "i think an Accordion fold doesnt need extra inches to the folds because its
    accordion not a roll or barrel.\r\na standing accordion fold from birds eye view
    would look like a \"Z\"\r\nand a barrel or a roll would look more like an \"N\"
    or a backwards \"C\" like a bracket."

    body: It still needs adjusting, not inches just millimeters so that you dont get
      any edges sticking out or sitting too far in. As has been said the best bet
      is to ask the printer as they ahould be able to supply  a layout guide.
