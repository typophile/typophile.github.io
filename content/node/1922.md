  body: Dan X. Solo &#40;Solotype&#41; is an institution. You could send this guy
    a fax w/ what you were looking for and he&#39;d send you perfectly kerned, camera-ready
    art for a very modest fee. I&#39;m not sure what he&#39;s up to now but you can
    find various Solotype books in any B&amp;N or Borders bookstore.

  body: I tried to get in touch with them last year for an alphabet matter but I couldn&#39;t,
    I don&#39;t think they have an e-mail /web site address either, Ah! and they are
    always close in october to hunt for more type, I hope they still do. <BR> <BR>Lars,
    I can&#39;t tell you much but if You Like Type I recomend you <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/doverpublications/0486271692.html"
    target=_top>The Solotype Catalog</a>, tons of different typefaces, no complete
    alphabets but small samples, but it is worth it and inspiring, or just for the
    fun of it,  ... and there are some funny things along the pages ... <BR> <BR><img
