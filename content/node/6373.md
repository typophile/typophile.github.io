  body: 'Tobias,  <BR> <BR>each FontLab kerning class has a &#34;kerning scope&#34;,
    i.e. the information whether the kerning duplication should happen when the master
    glyph of a kerning class is used as first glyph or second glyph in a pair. This
    is what the checkboxes in Tools / Kerning Assistance define.  <BR> <BR>For example,
    you may have FontLab kerning classes &#40;defined in the Classes panel&#41;:  <BR>_e1:
    e&#39; oe eacute edieresis <BR>_e2: e&#39; eacute edieresis <BR>_o1: o&#39; oacute
    odieresis <BR>_o2: o&#39; oe oacute odieresis <BR>_y: y&#39; yacute ydieresis
    <BR> <BR>In Kerning assistance, _e1 and _o1 should have first glyph scope only,
    i.e. they should be activated only via the checkbox on the left side. This is
    because the kerning duplication is supposed to happen only when the master glyph
    of the class occurs as the first glyph in the pair.  <BR> <BR>Analogically, _e2
    and _o2 should be activated only via the checkbox on the right side because the
    kerning duplication is supposed to happen only when the master glyph of the class
    occurs as the second glyph in the pair.  <BR> <BR>Finally, _y can be activated
    on both sides since kerning should be duplicated in all situations.  <BR> <BR>Kerning
    classes don&#39;t need to limit themselves to accented glyphs only. In your case,
    you could make a class with the 2nd glyph scope &#40;checkbox on the right side
    in Kerning Assistance&#41; like following:  <BR> <BR>_m2: m&#39; n ncedilla nacute  <BR>
    <BR>Nothing stops you from doing that.  <BR> <BR>However, it is true that in FontLab&#39;s
    own class kerning, classes cannot include classes, so something like:  <BR>_n:
    n&#39; ncedilla nacute <BR>_m2: m&#39; @_n <BR>is not possible.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Class
    inheritance&#34; is possible if you define your kerning directly in the OpenType
    panel &#40;which is not the most user friendly thing to do <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> &#41; In the lower-right part of the OpenType panel, you
    can write OpenType class definitions:  <BR> <BR>@_n = [n ncedilla nacute];  <BR>@_m2
    = [m @_n];  <BR> <BR>But I don&#39;t think this is useful for kerning. But Class
    inheritance is useful for writing other OpenType layout feature definitions. For
    example, you might define classes for default figures and old-style figures &#40;to
    be used in the &#34;onum&#34; feature, for example&#41; as well as a class for
    all figures &#40;to be used in a different feature, e.g. &#34;sups&#34;&#41;:  <BR>
    <BR>@FIGS_DFLT = [zero one two three four five six seven eight nine];  <BR>@FIGS_ONUM
    = [zero.onum one.onum two.onum three.onum four.onum five.onum six.onum seven.onum
    eight.onum nine.onum];  <BR>@FIGS_ALL = [@FIGS_DFLT @FIGS_ONUM];  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam

  body: You don&#39;t need to have one-glyph classes. In FontLab, you always kern
    glyphs. The classes only contain information to which _other_ glyphs one wants
    the kerning values to apply.  <BR> <BR>&#62; Let
