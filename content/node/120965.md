  and I wanted to get some opinions on how best to display the font specimens in the
  font catalogue. I probably can't load the actual fonts, since there's a lot of fonts
  and they're all quite large, so I'm looking at SVG or raster image solutions. I
  like the Wikipedia style (<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HelveticaSpecimenCH.svg\">example</a>),
  but I'm open to other suggestions as well.\r\n\r\nThe specimen should also be small
  enough so that the user can quickly browse through the list of fonts. Optimally,
  the specimen would show off as much of the font as possible (letters, unique features,
  etc.) while providing a good sense of what the font would look like when used practically.
  Thinking of this, what word (any roman language) or combination of letters would
  be best to show off these features?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    You can skip all the other info on the Identifont page.\r\nSmall, comprehensive,
    and inter-font  comparable. Works for me.\r\nDon\r\n"

    know what I mean. I also need it to be a bit smaller, though reducing the font
    size in that image would work."

  body: "Most foundries and distributors have their own choice, from the minimal (e.g.
    FontFont\u2019s \"Rag\"), to the more complex (e.g. FontSquirrel\u2019s typefaces\u2019
    pages), but most of the time they show a list. I like the card idea, and Wikipedia\u2019s
    style isn\u2019t that bad. A similar implementation (which suffer, to me, from
    excessive differences in style among the cards) is shown in TypeCache\u2019s clusters:
    http://typecache.com/font-clusters/01\r\n\r\nAnyway, early questions to answer
    would be:\r\n<ul><li>one card design fits all? (for example, Google Fonts presents
    titling and text typefaces differently)</li>\r\n<li>one card content fits all?
    (Wikipedia\u2019s cards have unique content for each typeface, as the list views
    of several sellers)</li>\r\n<li>related to the above, will the name of the typeface
    be part of the card?</li>\r\n<li>how many styles will the card contain? (if the
    answer is \"one\", then how to present families? How about layered fonts?)</li>\r\n</ul>"

  body: "Thank you for the tips! I think I'll stick with the Wikipedia style.\r\n\r\nI
    plan on using different content for each font, though the bottom portion would
    probably stay the same. I found a way to show a preview of the different styles
    (see attached image below).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimen_5217.png]"

  body: "Just a couple of observations. \r\nI think you can (should?) move a bit further
    away from the Wikipedia format. For one I would move the name of the typeface
    above the card. That would leave space for more content. Also content could be
    more varied: for example, lowercase |a| is displayed three times, there\u2019s
    a complete lowercase, but just four capitals and just one diacritic (which could
    disappear if a different word is chosen). There\u2019s no ampersand, or punctuation
    or any other glyph "
