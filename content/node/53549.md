    tho, I only like when they use it. When other major companies use it, it doesn\u2019t
    look so polished.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "What about iThinkyouneedalife?\r\n\r\nCertainly Myriad is better than ITC
    Garamond Grotesquely Condensed (as if ITC Garamond needed any help looking grotesque)
    but that's not saying much is it. The custom Myriad is for the iPhone/iPod/iTard
    only, no?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
