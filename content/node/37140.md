body: Saw some images on flickr with Bantjes in a lecture talking about type (and
  materials/excecution) There were some done in sugar. Does anyone know where this
  lecture was held and if it is available in any format for me to view?

  body: Hi Ricardo. Yep it was the same images as on Eben's flickr page but I saw
    them in another account and not Eben's but that is irrelevant now that you found
    Eben's site. Tnx

  body: Saw her work again in San Francisco this week at Adobe/AIGA's <a href="http://www.designmatterslive.com/">Design
    Matters Live</a> series. Was even more impressive the second time around as we
    got to hear her talk about her rise to stardom in an interview with Debbie Millman.

    it's expensive and a logistic nightmare. It normally ends with interest. Not being
    able to make it fit with the designers schedule."

    what does someone thinking of moving to Canada or the US and looking for a job
    have to do with Marian's sugar type? :)

    she showed images from that promotion --including the sugar type-- at the Type
    Directors Club, too."

  body: "Hehe Tamye: It was a long stretch. I was just being frustrated with the lack
    of good lectures here in Norway (like Marian Bantjes's lecture) and was considerfing
    moving to Canada or the States to be able to attend the many great lectures there
    (rather than hoping for them here and being dissapointed)\r\n\r\nJames: Don't
    think they wanna send them to Norway but I'll definetly give it a shot!"
