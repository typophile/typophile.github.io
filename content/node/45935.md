  body: "Certainly not Antique Olive, but if this is an ad for Carlsberg then there
    is a good chance that this is the custom Carlsberg Sans.\r\nFor something similar,
    Peter Bruhn (Fountain) has done some nice soft sans typefaces. (ie. [[http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ketchupa.asp|Ketchupa]]) "
