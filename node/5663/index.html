		<div class="commentbody">Paul,  <BR> <BR>I don't think it's a good idea to incorporate contextual substitutions of the long-s. Depending on the language used, the rules were very different. So for English, the rules are fairly simple, but for example for German, they aren't. The short s is not only used at the end of words, but also, in compound words, the short s is used where a prefix or a stem ends. For example, in &quot;ansteigen&quot; (because it's &quot;an|steigen&quot;), you would have a long s but in &quot;austrinken&quot; you would have a short s (as it's &quot;aus|trinken&quot;). Similarly, there are special rules for French, or Polish, or other languages that used long s in the past.  <BR> <BR>Therefore, it's impossible to build a proper universal contextual substitution mechanism. IMVHO, it doesn't make sense to make rules that would only work in one language (e.g. English) but perhaps actually break other languages.  <BR> <BR>As for the correct form of a ligature long s + short s, I do recommend to look at <em>well-designed</em> sharp s (</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul,  <BR> <BR>there is no such thing as &quot;how does the hist feature work anyway&quot; ;) Application developers may choose several ways to implement the feature.  <BR> <BR>The OpenType specification:  <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm#hist" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm#hist">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm#hist</a></a> <BR>says that the feature should work as a GSUB lookup type 1, i.e. a simple substitution. This means that contextual substitutions should not be used.  <BR> <BR>Microsoft's Longhorn OpenType Layout implementation enumerates HinstoricalForms as &quot;boolean&quot; so it will be just an on/off function, just like ligatures in InDesign.  <BR><a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/graphicsmm/overviews/text/typography_ovw.aspx" target="_blank"><a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/graphicsmm/overviews/text/typography_ovw.aspx">http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/graphicsmm/overviews/text/typography_ovw.aspx</a></a> <BR> <BR>AFAIK, Adobe InDesign doesn't currently support the &quot;hist&quot; feature other than by the Glyphs palette, but may add an &quot;on/off&quot; support in future.  <BR> <BR>It is possible to implement different substitutions rules for different languages. However, (1) the OpenType specification recommends using only GSUB lookup type 1, i.e. simple substitutions (not contextual substitutions) for the feature. (2) As I explained earlier, a properly working contextual &quot;hist&quot; feature for many languages would be simply impossible to build, just like a properly working contextual ligatures feature that would substitute &quot;fi&quot; or &quot;fl&quot; ligatures &ndash; in German, you are allowed to put the &quot;fl&quot; ligature in &quot;anfliegen&quot; but not in &quot;auflegen&quot;, because the former is &quot;an|fliegen&quot; and the latter is &quot;auf|legen&quot;. You are not allowed to put ligatures between a prefix and a stem. Supporting this in an automatic way would require dictionary support so it's not really possible to solve it within a font.  <BR> <BR>Therefore, I recommend implementing the &quot;hist&quot; feature just using a simple substitution:  <BR> <BR>sub s by long <BR> <BR>and let the user turn it on and off locally where required.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam <BR></div>

(I used calt because that is one that is easily accessible in InDesign.) Of course, I am free to program this however I want since this font is only for personal use anyway, so my method might not be appropriate for you.
