body: "What are some typefaces you guys would recommend looking at if you wanted to
  move from using Gill Sans, forward in a more contemporary direction, say 10% forward
  (perhaps another more recently designed humanist sans) and maybe some directions
  that move more radically in a different direction but hint at the origins?\r\n\r\nNot
  sure I put it very eloquently, so I hope I've got my point across.\r\n\r\nBasically,
  suggestions for a small move forward from Gill Sans, and also suggestions for a
  large leap forward as well.\r\n\r\nEg, off the top of my head a small move might
  be myriad, scala, meta or frutiger, a large move perhaps legato, DIN, helvetica?\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  any suggestions appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nChristian\r\n\r\n"

    been a leap too far ahead so I'm glad it's the kind you're looking for.\r\n\r\n>
    Proxima Nova is more of a humanist font then the geometric Gill Sans, so I would
    lump it into the \u2018big leap\u2019 category.\r\n\r\nRani, isn't it the other
    way around? I wouldn't classify Proxima Nova as a humanist sans, I think it as
    a geometric-grotesque, it's like Futura-Neturaface-Adzidenz Grotesk mixed tastefully.
    :^)\r\n\r\nHere's another suggestion, <a href=\"http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php\">Freight
    Sans</a> by Joshua Darden, I think it's got enough quirks."

      humanist elements in the lowercase. But maybe going so far as to call it humanist
      was a little bit of an exaggeration. I am somewhat blurry on the term names
      so it is actually a helpful learning experience to be corrected, weird I know.
      Thanks for that Geoff. :-)\r\n\r\nOh and Mark Simonson reads these forums, so
      I am somewhat embarrassed with calling his font humanist before.\r\n\r\n"

    is a fresher face, then Bliss I agree is excellent. \r\n\r\nBut if you are using
    Gill for almost all your projects then moving forward I think involves using different
    faces for different projects, and not having a 'standard'. The advantage of today's
    proliferation of good faces means that you can get distinctive, suitable faces
    to use for different projects, suiting the distinctive needs of the project. "

  body: I will add that as part of the 10% improvement, some of the fonts mentioned
    above such as Today, Seria and Scala sans have real small caps and (in the case
    of seria and scala) expert collections w/ligatures and fractions. Gill has none
    of that which makes it limited for some uses. Agenda, despite the thoroughness
    of its weights and all the condensed options, doesn't have expert collections.
    Nor does Bliss.

    next step for a humanist sans, especially given its large typographic range, including
    condensed, small caps, figure alternatives, and hands!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether
    you'd consider this a small or large step from Gill Sans. Obviously faces like
    Bliss, Agenda, and English Grotesque are closer."
