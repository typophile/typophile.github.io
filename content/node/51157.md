  site?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.designassembly.org/\r\n\r\nFor an extra two points can anyone
  explain how this is appearing as html text. I'm obviously a bit behind here. But
  I thought websites could only be set in the six or seven system fonts: Arial, Times,
  Verdana etc.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate it if anyone could clear this up.\r\n\r\nMarc"

    myself by explaining the advances in web text. But search Typophile or the web
    in general for topics like CSS, Flash, SIFR and the @font_face tag to get an idea
    of the options available to pixel pushers these days.'

    are slight differences. The lower case 'y' for one.\r\n\r\nMarc"

    No Georgia installed?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild5_5712.jpg]"

    code of the discussed web page:\r\n\r\nfont-family:Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\r\n\r\nSo
    your browser should select Georgia if you have it. If not, Times, etc.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I don't know of a way to check which font files your browser actually
    picked to generate the text. I think the only way is to judge by eye.\r\n\r\nJurriaan"
