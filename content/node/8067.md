    <BR> <BR>But if we remove Him from all historical context as an actual man --
    regardless of whatever else we believe or do not believe Him to be --, e.g. by

  body: Not only did I not fall for it, but I thought it was downright manipulative
    &#40;although not through a desire to put down Christianity&#42;, more for the
    thrill of telling a story and the vanity of having people believe it&#41;. The
    whole book in fact seems manipulative, even the way the chapters are broken. I
    was feeling the author&#39;s [sleight of] hand the whole way through, and the
    main emotion this caused in me was pity for the general readership. Anyway, I
    read it because it was a birthday gift from a friend &#40;who <i>had</i> fallen
    for it, probably because of anti-Christian zeal&#42;&#42;&#41; and I really need
    to read more fiction. <BR> <BR>&#42; In fact in the end it becomes totally apologetic.
    Although worse still was the huge logical disconnect between the burning need
    to locate the Grail versus the outright nonchalance at having lost it. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;
    Which I actually feel is not misplaced in its origins, but often is in its intent.
    <BR> <BR>All that said, my main point above was that I do suspect you harbor too
    much disdain for the book, and you keep that too restrained. But I could be wrong
    on either or both. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'I have not read the book, and am not interested to do so. I read <i>Holy
    Blood, Holy Grail</i>, from which Brown apparently takes almost all his ideas,
    many years ago, and was so unimpressed by its lack of understanding of the mediaeval
    mind that I was not tempted to give any credence to its wacky theories. Brown&#39;s
    commericial cleverness is to package these stale ideas in a fast-paced novel.
    Anyone who has studied the mediaeval imagination knows that the grail quest legend
    is allegorical. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve spoken with a few people who read the book,
    most depressingly people who claim to be Christians but whose knowledge of their
    own religion is so poor that they can&#39;t tell what in the book is Brown&#39;s
    invention. Apparently Ron Howard is going to direct the movie, which I&#39;m sure
    will be a fine addition to the long canon of Hollywood anti-Catholic bigotry.
    <BR> <BR>I did read a very good review of <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> in the Atlantic
    Monthly a few months ago, written by a professor of renaissance art history. Her
    biggest complaint about the book was not its anti-Catholicism, but the fact that
    people reading the book were encouraged to think they had learned something about
    Leondardo&#39;s painting. She did a very nice job providing an orthodox interpretation
    of all the features of <i>The Last Supper</i> that Brown takes as hidden clues
    to his big secret, showing how the painting closely conforms to the Gospel account
    of the last supper. As she wrote: the Gospels are the real Da Vinci code, the
    key to understanding his paintings.'

  body: '&#34;dark-light passage&#34; <BR>As I think, every christian holiday is related
    to that passage. <BR> <BR>The origin of course is Easter: <BR>From the time of
    fear and despair after the death of Jesus Christ - indeed in real darkness on
    the night from Saturday to &#40;Easter-&#41;Sunday - to the light of resurrection
    first heard of in the morning and from there on beginning an increasing flow of
    hope and vision for future. <BR>Jesus himself before has been a human light for
    people living in human, political and economic darkness. Jesus&#39; death was
    like a fall back into darkness. <BR> <BR>But the other holidays reflect this same
    event and its passage in other terms: <BR>Christmas: <BR>The advent-time remembers
    the need of healing brokenness and badness of our world a&#41; in former times
    &#40;before christ&#41; and b&#41; in our times and that we await a second coming
    of Christ, finishing his work &#40;as well as personal in and for us, as well
    as historical some time in the future&#41;.  <BR>And Christmas celebrates his
    coming and starting to reveal Gods light to humans. So darkness-light-passage
    is appropriate as well.  <BR>And the time was chosen &#40;nobody never pretended
    to know Jesus was born in december&#41;, because it&#39;s the darkest time of
    the year regarding to day-night. <BR>I like that, because I think it is important
    not to evade the bad things and &#40;personal and political&#41; brokenness but
    to take up with that, to be aware, and on the other side to get power by a good
    news of light. <BR> <BR>Pentecost: <BR>It has fire as a symbol, and fire and light
    show the same. The disciples of Christ before were fearful and despaired, closed
    themselves in their rooms &#40;dark&#41;, and then went out and spoke in the daylight.
    <BR> <BR>It is important for me to make it clear that with &#34;political darkness&#34;
    I don&#39;t mean minor ethical problems &#40;who may marry whom - you can be of
    different positions in that point - it won&#39;t destroy the earth&#41; but for
    example covering people with war &#40;even in the best intention&#41;, landmines
    or giving all power to money and business. <BR> <BR>Now back to design: <BR>I
    was wondering about what part of the design in your URL you referred to. Thank
    you for making it clear. <BR>I didn&#39;t see the cross in the kosmopolitan, and
    was wondering if there&#39;s a local tradition of a fawn with red spots &#40;blood?&#41;
    instead of a lamb? ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Titus: Thank you for the picture. I like it.'

    in the &#40;nice monetarily-wealthy western&#41; world bought themselves presents
    instead of me. <BR> <BR>People in the UK spent an estimated $2bn on Christmas
    Eve this year. How many people could that money save? How many generic HIV antivirals
    could be bought for that? How much renewable energy projects?
