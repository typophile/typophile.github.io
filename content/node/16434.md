  <em>vintage</em> on his one.\r\n\r\nThe play is about hippies and all that crap.
  I have the concept for the poster already, I just need to execute the idea, and
  this is the one thing that I'm not sure about. The poster is inspired by blotter
  art, and will essentially <strong>be</strong> a sheet of blotter with this logotype
  underneath the blotter (I am planning to take out the pieces of the actuall blotter
  so you can see the logotype, like a puzzle).\r\n\r\nOh, and the play is called \"The
  Grateful Alive\", yeah as in \"The Grateful Dead\". :)\r\nI need (with your help
  I hope) yet to figure out the placement for the \"The\" and the \"Alive\". I'm thinking:
  \"The\"--top left, \"Alive\"--bottom right. But I'm not sure about the style.\r\n\r\nAny
  help appreciated.\r\n\r\nEdit: Aaargh, stupid SmartyPants ..."

  body: "\"I was actually at the original Woodstock\"\r\n\r\nWhooohoo, really?! That
    had to be really cool experience. So do you remember any of it? (Just kidding
    :))\r\n\r\nI have considered a capital G myself, but this is just the first draft,
    as you can see I didn't even bother to fit it to the sheet of paper. :)\r\n\r\nI
    will post a followup the day after tomorrow, I won't have internet access for
    about 24hrs.\r\n\r\nI was kinda thikning to throw in a fat outline (not too fat
    though) and adding a \"3D\"--graffiti like 3D, to go aroud 3-4cm to the south.
    Also some shading on it.\r\n\r\nI'm  just typing what I'm thinking right now,
    we'll see ...\r\n\r\nThanx for taking the time to respond.\r\n_______________________________\r\n<a

  body: "Hi people, I apologise for resurecting an old topic, but I just wanted to
    report an update to my project.\r\n\r\nHere's the preview of the yet unfinished
    poster. I am interested in comments on the logotype itself as I think this is
    it, and also advices for the typeface for the \"misc. information\" (sorry, I
    don't know the rigth term, names of the actors and such).\r\n\r\nAs you can see
    it is in the bottom right now in Helvetica bold, but I don't plan on leaving it
    in Helvetica.\r\n\r\nSuggestions anyone?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TGA_poster_unfinished.jpg]\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\n<a

  body: "I like it but substitute the v symbol with a hand holding a daisy. The v
    symbol was used in that era but it was also used as the victory symbol by Churchill
    in WWII. The daisy was a pacifist symbol for peace.\r\n\r\nNow on the type \"The
    would never be on a straight line It would follow the curve of the characters
    below. The h would drop and tuck under the t and get larger and the e would follow
    the curve and become larger (filling the space). These posters were hand drawn
    and they took liberties to fake spacing. The second l in gratefull looks like
    a t. Once again make Alive fill the shape and follow the curve. Destortion is
    a good thing for 60s a look. "

    The minute I posted it here I thought to myself: \"Man, this has to flow better.\".
    :)\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, \"grateful\" is spelled with one L, or have I just
    made myself the biggest ass on the forum? :)\r\n\r\nPS\r\n\r\nThe comment for
    the v symbol stands as well. You know so much about this Dan, I have surely learned
    a lot, so thanx once again, you've been really helpfull.\r\n\r\nThe whole logotype
    was actually hand-drawn and then hand-traced, so I might look into the freehand
    option as well.\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dnevnikeklektika.com\">Dnevnik

  body: "The and Alive and the G are much more of the genre you are trying to recreate,
    your first post is more along the right lines, your other characters are a little
    bit blackletter meets art nouveau. The swash on the bottom of the t is hindering
    recognition, you could look at bringing the f down to link to the swash and have
    the t as a more recognisable character, btw your a & e counters look white rather
    than the background pattern\r\nYou are right about the spelling of Grateful.\r\nAs
    for the v sign (although it wouldn't be ideal for the UK*) I think, given the
    context and style of the poster, you can use it if it doesn't have any local cultural
    connotations beyond peace.\r\nTim\r\n*I first thought you were telling the Grateful
    Alive to go forth and multiply (or rather a more Anglo-Saxon term)"
