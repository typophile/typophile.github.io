  this typeface and I'd like to identity it. At first glance I thought it was a version
  of Neo, but I soon found out its different. Can someone please identity it? Thanks
  in Advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_3851.jpg]"

  body: "After a bit of detective work I figured out that this is a new typeface called
    BellSlim designed this year by Canadian type designer [[http://www.ianbrignellletteringdesign.com|Ian
    Brignell]]. You can read a small bit about him [[http://villatype.blogspot.com/2008/04/type-club-review-part-2-ian-brignell.html|here]].
    \r\n\r\nThere is no reference to BellSlim anywhere online as far as I can gather
    but here is a link to the [[http://www.bell.ca/web/flash/bellSlim.swf|flash route
    file]] that the Bell website is using to render the font with (the same sIFR system
    typophile uses). The specific name of the font being used is BellSlim Regular
    which might suggest that there are more weights in existence."

  body: "Well, my dad's worked for Bell Canada for longer than I've been alive and
    I've seen quite a few versions of their identity throughout my life (yes, we have
    some Bell antiques around the house too)\r\n\r\nI will say that for a company
    whose main focus is telecommunications, except for the logo just before this re-brand
    (the spinning-head logo as it was affectionately known), Bell has always had good
    design in their print materials.\r\n\r\nThis logo is a modern take on their logo
    from the 1970s, which was just the word <em>Bell</em> in a bold Sans.  I don't
    watch any old-school television (internet television like <em>revision3.com</em>
    all the way!) so I regretfully haven't seen any of the TV ads, and am bewildered
    as to why they have chosen to embolden random letters on their website, but I'm
    sure it makes sense to somebody somewhere.\r\n\r\nI think this re-brand is needed
    to freshen up the corporate image a little bit, the other one was easily datable
    as 1990s, and this will obviously be somewhat dated in the future, but I think
    it has much much more potential and staying power than the one that preceded it."

    was named <em>the</em> most mis-managed brand of its caliber. And even after this
    last rebrand (facelift) it still feels lacking and un-engaging, especially compared
    to Telus that did and continues to be doing [[http://video.google.ca/videosearch?q=telus++tv+ads|an
    absolutely marvelous job]] with their branding."

  body: "Alright, after days of researches and dozens of attempts I finally got that
    font out of a PDF file that was containing it. By the way, Bell totally missed
    that part with the PDF which was a documentation about their website design at
    Bell.ca, and you can find it relatively easy in google... so yeah, I got that
    PDF and extracted the font from there.\r\n\r\nNow, I know some of you might say
    that it is stealing and all that, but hey! who is the idiot that is going to use
    it in commercial purposes? So be careful - for personal and noncommercial use
    only(!!!) as the font belongs to Bell Company and its designer, Ian Brignell.\r\n\r\nENJOY!\r\n<strong>\"BellSlim
    Regular\"</strong>\r\n&#091;&#091; link removed by Admin &#093;&#093;\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is a pic that I made using this font:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bell
    font_4334.jpg]\r\n*Note: The \"Bell\" font is just \"Century Gothic - Bold\",
    not sure if it is the actual one used for the \"Bell\" logo, but it is very similar...*\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, according to the PDF, there is indeed another version of the \"BoldSlim\"
    font in SemiBold, but unfortunately, it was not used in the PDF itself, so I don't
    have it.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nosallivan"
