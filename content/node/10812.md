  body: Yes, I&#39;ve got the logo.  Unfortunately my series of projects involves
    taking common logos and changing words to generate recognizable spoofs.  Hence
    all of the common logo id requests. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve actually generated
    quite a few so far -- though I still need to purchase Introspect for the Albertsons
    font since it&#39;s not in my archives.  For 7-11 I settled on a Futura Condensed
    UltraBlack with some editing to weigh the characters on the left side a bit.
