body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nLooking to update my resume as I have just completed my B.A.
  in Graphic Design Communication and currently job hunting. I have designed a simple
  logotype for myself using Herbert Lubalin's ITC Avant Garde, for I recognize the
  strength of his geometric display face. \r\n\r\nPlease click for larger image:\r\n<a

  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v105/VanDamage/GRAPHIC%20DESIGN/th_website_cover.jpg\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\" ></a>\r\n\r\nI previously made the mistake of applying
  Lubalin Graph as a complement to AG because it is a slab serif form of the AG. However,
  I wish to alter my decision to a more appropriate solution and not sure what direction
  to go.\r\n\r\nI require a type for headings and slight body copy that won't dilute
  the logotype but harmonize with it. Should I look for a serif with a large x-height?
  Frankly I am at a loss and any input would be greatly appreciated."

    then you should be able to figure out the design yourself. I see too many \"designers\"
    coming on here and asking design advice, trying to get other people to pick out
    major design decisions for them.\r\n\r\nInstead, do some tests. Make different
    versions with different typefaces. See what looks good to you. After all, if you
    are promoting yourself then don't go with whatever some random internet-person
    tells you. Do what YOU like and what will best represent YOU. If you \"recognize
    the strength of his geometric display face\" then you should be able to recognize
    when a font properly \"harmonizes\" with it."

    of one's self is more difficult to define than for another, for the subject is
    personal. \r\n\r\nI am not suggesting that I will lightly take the suggestions
    provided on this forum, but I feel that strong design can be best achieved with
    sound advice, guidance, and outside input from like-minded others.\r\n\r\nIn most
    firms designers work in creative teams, so input is something I greatly value
    and can aid me in my search through the myriad of typefaces out there.\r\n\r\nSo
    please don't take my inquiry as you design it for me, but rather an explorative
    question to possible design outcomes that I can apply to help formulate the best
    solution."

  body: "Sheesh, what's with the snappy replies? These forums have certainly seen
    inquiries both less thoughtful and less valid.\r\n\r\nTo the original poster:
    It's a good thing that you're rethinking the Lubalin Graph \u2013 it would harmonize,
    obviously, with AG but it's a beast to read for any length of text really. If
    you try to match via contrast instead, you have quite a big variety of options
    (probably so many as to be dizzying though!). You might first try to go as far
    as you possibly can (try a soft/calligraphic serif, like Dolly) then gradually
    move \xABback\xBB (try something with less contrast, less softness) \u2013 maybe.
    \r\nI'm thinking the real challenge is to not make the type selection look like
    an afterthought, since your logo is very coherent and deeply rooted in the AG.
    Your future visual identity will somehow have to bridge, and be defined by, both
    the logo and the type choice/treatment. I'm not sure what to recommend, but I
    tend to think you shouldn't so much try to think of fonts that would <em>\xABgo
    with the logo\xBB</em> than fonts that, <em>together with this logo, could make
    for a strong identity.</em> Does that make any sense?"

  body: Thanks for the input still testing ideas. @Nina I think contrast for body
    text is what I'm aiming for now and potentially using a much lighter weight of
    AG Pro for headings without the alternative characters.

  body: I like what you did here.  Using the lubalin family keeps a branded feel.  The
    only suggestion I have is to watch out that 'personal experience' might read as
    a single title.  Perhaps contact and personal info could be grouped with the name
    at the top, maybe left justified against the logotype?

  body: "EBDesign, I agree with the comment above. What's with the snappy reply? I
    thought that's what forums like these are for? I've been in the design industry
    for almost 20 years and I still post to forums for ideas. I'm not asking anyone
    to do my work for me, rather I'm interested in input, brainstorming and sometimes,
    because I work independently in my own business, I even crave creative direction.
    \r\n\r\nSo let's lighten up. We're all in this business together. \r\n\r\nAaron,
    I love Avant Garde. It's a difficult type to compliment and I think you've done
    a good job. Your resume looks clean, sharp and attention-getting. My only suggestion
    is to also do a version on white. Consider the PR person who has to read 100+
    resumes. Reverse type is the hardest to read so in situations such as that, you
    may want a white version.\r\n\r\nGood job Aaron. Lookin' good."

    that resume and use up an entire month's worth of ink or toner in doing so. For
    PDF, I'd stick with white backgrounds. \r\n\r\nI second Luma's comment about 'PERSONAL
    EXPERIENCE' reading as one title. Perhaps the address block could be moved entirely
    out of that area. "

  body: "Thanks for the feedback everyone, It is much stronger than my former resume
    in both written copy and design. I am one step ahead of your suggestions on the
    black and white version, for I have already drafted one for easy copying and will
    be bringing in the above color version for formal interviews and direct screen
    download from my portfolio site.\r\n\r\n@ Luma Vine, I concur with the personal
    experience combo, tomorrow when I have access to my machine I will juggle the
    copy perhaps or maybe use another word rather than \"Personal.\"\r\n\r\nI formerly
    placed my contact info top left justified against the logotype which I can upload
    tomorrow to for comparison, but I was not a raving fan of it post doing. I believe
    it cluttered up the negative space surrounding my name on the top. However, that
    doesn't mean I won't attempt it again.\r\n"
