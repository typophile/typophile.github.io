  including the ornaments cuts. As it was a relatively new font for me I started to
  gather inspiration on usage around the web (mainly Vogue & Google images) to look
  at styling and layout compositions.\r\nOne of our recent proposals included usage
  of some Didot ornaments, more in a abstract decorative manner and I'm keen to study
  this area further.\r\n\r\nWould anyone know of any online resource or even books
  I could purchase on modern/contempory usage of Didot ornaments? If nothing so specific
  any suggestions for further reading?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nHugo\r\n  "

    1923, but it doesn't list a Didot ornament series of ornaments. The closest it
    comes is a Bodoni series.

  body: "Akira Kobayashi's FF Acanthus has some good neoclassical ornamentation.\r\n\r\nBut
    surely the point of the Didone (modern) style was a spartan classicism.\r\nThe
    only ornament really necessary when working in this style is the bulging rule;
    IIRC H&FJ have a few of those.\r\n\r\nVarious Didone glyphs have been used decoratively,
    such as the asterisk.\r\n\r\nI included a few dingbats (not really ornaments)
    in Scotch Modern.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dings_5303.png]"

    was this a 'fad of the times' or something that was added at a later date? I really
    know very little history of ornaments.\r\n\r\nThere seems a lot of attention in
    getting them to mirror a Didone ascetic of unornamented structure and a \"modern\"
    appearance, I would have thought ornaments useful in typographic design of today
    when you see attributes of fonts like flourishes becoming (perhaps too) popular
    within typography also.\r\n"

    too. They are absolutely wretched..."

  body: "I think Adrian Fruitger was influenced by La Henriade when he 'revised' Didot
    to a family of 12 weights including the ornaments in 1991, so recent editions
    they are.\r\nI've heard typographers call them elegant, classic and even powerful
    but never wretched!\r\nJust out of interest as I enjoy hearing constructive criticism,
    why do you feel that way?\r\n\r\n...one mans rubbish is anothers treasure i suppose

    appears that whoever designed the Didot Ornaments shown above took \"Modern\"
    to mean \"Art Moderne,\" a.k.a. Art Deco,a style which they attempt--at least
    to my eye, rather poorly--to emulate.\r\nOn the other hand, the Bodoni ornaments
    below which appear in the book I referenced are in keeping with their actual historical
    period, and are--again, to my eye--rather elegant.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni_ornaments_5151.png]"

    as this is design, the purpose of which is to resolve contradictions, there may
    be a way to make good the ornaments with their typeface. The harder the challenge,
    the more potential. Are you up for it, Hugo?"

    not going to peturb me. I'll need to work with them for a while before I'll feel
    comfortable presenting further and I have some time (until the new year) to guideline
    usage of these cuts within their corporate visual guides. I'm still not sure if
    they will end up in there or not, I need to look at application carefully, in
    the wrong hands it could end up a disaster.\r\n\r\nI'm rather excited about the
    reference of 'Art Moderne' by Nick though, I hadn't thought to research in that
    era or art style. I sense it's not an area of passion for you both but again,
    could you recommend further reading in this area?\r\n\r\nI have also taken advice
    and purchased myself a copy of Giambattista Bodoni - Manuale Tipografico (well
    it is my birthday today and amazon twists the arm so well). It's one of only a
    handful of serious historical reference books I've bought since my college days
    and almost since I owned my first computer, which I'm sure is more to-do the reason.
    So I look forward to receiving it, it's a good read at over 1200 pages too.\r\n
