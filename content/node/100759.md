  (in orange, towards the end of the sequence):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sashaprood.com/art/Scroll_Portfolio_02.jpg\r\n\r\nThey
  inspired me to start experimenting with a very geometric approach to a textura font
  myself. In particular, I'd like to stick to (quasi-)circular arcs and straight lines
  with either horizontal, vertical, or 45\xB0 diagonal stroke cuts. Here's what I
  have so far:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zukunft_5914.png]\r\n\r\nIt
  feels strangely complementary to my previous work on Octant, where I applied blackletter
  features to a humanist serif chassis, whereas here I'm applying features from geometric
  sans to a blackletter chassis.\r\n\r\nWhaddya think?\r\n\r\nI was toying with the
  name \"Zukunft\", in the line of Futura and Avenir, but that seems to be taken already.

    tiny tail attached to an otherwise unmodified |O|, but if I try that here, the
    tail basically falls off. I'll try out a different architecture, with a larger
    tail under rather than next to the body of the |Q|.  That happens to be my favorite
    solution for |Q| in general.\r\n\r\nI rather like my |S| so far \u2014 maybe a
    bit on the wide side. Luckily Textura isn't meant to be used in all-caps... I'll
    push it together a bit and see if it looks more harmonious that way, though. I

    best with the |t|, which requires a heavy crossbar to be recognizable as such,

    of Gryffensee's characters have pointy feet, so that \"hovering\" sensation is
    not unusual.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6_5420.png]\r\n\r\nYou're
    right about the unhandsome alternate |K|. The new one looks significantly better
    while still keeping a bit of the gruff blackletter attitude.  ;o)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KK_5535.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    alternate |G| is a bit more difficult. I disagree that the previous version looked
    more old-fashioned than the default |G| \u2014 the tailed shape is still common
    in contemporary script and calligraphy fonts, whereas the default Fraktur |G|
    is positively alien. Personally, I find it the least recognizable letter in Klingspor
    Gotisch. \r\n\r\nIn any case, I've made some experimental variations of the alternate
    |G|. I like the diagonal connection in the interior \u2014 it gives the |G| a
    crossbar, though it also evokes a lightning-bolt shape in the glyph that may through
    the reader's eye off track. The right-most version works pretty well; I'm considering
    that as the new alternate. However, I happen to have a particular soft spot for
    tailed |G|s, so I might still go for the second or third version instead...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GGGGG_5790.png]\r\n\r\nAs
    for the |s|...  I actually quite like it that way. It's in a way the most \"futuristic\"
    glyph of the font, and that's an intentional connotation of the font concept.
    However, I'm open to suggestions. Do you have any ideas on how to improve it...?
    (Otherwise, you can always use the long |\u017F|! ;o)\r\n\r\nThanks again for

    and I also find my allegiances fluctuating a lot. I've always liked the slim |s|,
    though \u2014 it has a certain understated elegance and embodies the font's geometric,
    reductionist philosophy very well. I am certainly going to keep it, perhaps even
    for both cuts of the font.\r\n\r\nThe Klingspor |s| is pretty, but as Johan remarks,
    it feels highly non-geometric (although it technically adheres to the rules I've
    set up); in fact, I find it even somehow manages to undermine the geometric feel
    of entire words it appears in, yielding the impression of a traditional fraktur
    font. That can be desirable, of course, but I don't think it should be the main
    aim of the font. \r\n\r\nConversely, though, my original |s| looks very geometric
    indeed, almost a bit too freaky. It has no relation whatsoever to established
    blackletter shapes... and it's too heavy, too.\r\n\r\nAlright, then. How about
    I release the font in three versions? One with the traditional caps and Klingspor
    |s|, one with the legible caps and the slim |s|, and a third one with the geometric
    |s| (and possibly the traditional caps?).\r\n\r\nI also intend to make one of
    the three the master font and add all variations in as stylistic alternates, so
    professionals can mix and match the styles freely. Which of the three do you think
    should be the default...? \r\n\r\nBy the way, I've made spine of the slim |s|

    My comments about your Cyrillic are layman's -- I have only designed two letterforms
    in my life: a capital and lowercase |yogh| to get along with Alcuin. Moreover,
    I am a Pole but I have read my share of Russian books and own \u0428\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442\u044B,
    a Soviet book with specimens of hundreds of typefaces. The bottom line: I offer
    you my comments in good faith without aspiring for the prize.\r\n\r\nThe minuscule
    looks good. I think |\u0437| usually has no descender, and never has it |\u044F|.
    Also, the left bar of |\u044A| should protrude.\r\n\r\nThe |\u0414| should have
    two distinct vertical serifs at the bottom. Now I might mistake it for |\u0410|.
    I would suggest that you go with a roman |\u0422| (you already have a non-cursive
    |\u0414|). This would also allow you to make |\u041C| more typical. Also, you
    might think of a way to connect the two parts of |\u0427| more visibly. Finally,
    the |\u042D| is very unusual -- you might try to base it on a circle.\r\n\r\nI
    have also minor comments to:\r\n|\u0412|: I know it's taken from the Latin version,
    but it looks a bit like cursive |\u0414|.\r\n|\u0416|: Although I find it legible,
    you might experiment with moving the top left and bottom right slanted strokes
    closer towards the mean line.\r\n|\u041B|: The angle between the left and the
    top strokes is usually straight or even obtuse.\r\n|\u0423|: You might experiment
    with making the descender open to distinguish it better from |\u0426|.\r\n\r\nFeel
    free to ignore any part of my grumbling, especially when real natives speak up.
    Do you plan to design also non-Russian Cyrillic letterforms?"

    body: "Hi Marcin, welcome to the forum and thanks for your comments!\r\n\r\nMinuscule:
      Latin blackletter often has some descenders where antiqua usually doesn't, such
      as in |h|, |z|, |x|, |f|, |\xDF|, and some capitals. As a result, I feel entitled
      to do the same thing to Cyrillic... but if it just comes across as weird or
      illegible, I'll try to work around it. My main problem is that my x-height is
      awfully cramped, what with my wide stroke and geometric constraints. Cyrillic
      exacerbates the problem by stuffing a lot of pen-unfriendly forms and tiny distinctions
      into the x-height. I'm taking every chance I have to break free from that space
      (I even used to have a descender on |\u0432| but found that too weird in the
      end).\r\n\r\nAs for the |\u044A|, I know it's supposed to protrude to the left,
      but that will create a gaping hole of white space in a word. Maybe Cyrillic
      expects this sort of white space for legibility, but in a blackletter that relies
      on blackness for texture, it sticks out like a sore thumb... anyway, I'll try
      to come up with something. Maybe if I had it protrude diagonally to the upper
      left...?\r\n\r\nI see what you mean about the |\u0414| \u2014 it's annoying
      to have to rely on serifs when I'm trying to avoid serifs in general. I'll try
      an alternate structure based on the Roman |L|; hopefully that will also work
      for |\u041B|. I'm fine with using the Roman |T|. Do you think my Roman |M| will
      be recognizable as such, or will it look too much like a cursive |T|?\r\n\r\nI
      also see what you mean for |\u0427|. Do you think the problem is less pronounced
      in |\u0418|, which shares the same connective tissue? If I can find a good shape
      for |\u0427|, maybe that will also solve the |\u0423| problem that you mention.\r\n\r\nI
      did try a circular form of |\u042D| first, but found it looked out of character
      with the blackletter. I might just go back to that.\r\n\r\nNon-Russian characters:
      Yes, I've been looking to fill in the \"Adobe Extended\" range as provided in
      the Glyphs application. I noticed I'll have to make the |E| angular so as to
      distinguish it from |\u0404| \u2014 that's rather annoying...\r\n"

    I do know it is rather unacceptable in blackletter.\r\n\r\nI understand your aversion

      on the capital |\u0462 (Yat)|. Given the archaic feel of blackletter, I would
      guess this letter will be used more often than in everyday writing (that is:
      more often than not at all).\r\nIMHO, the current version would work better
      as the ultra-special |\u048C (Semisoft sign)| that you understandably haven't
      done. Its generally small size puts it in the same league as |\u042C| and |\u042A|
      that don't represent any sounds. But |\u0462| is a full, majestic letter that
      represents |\u0415|. Try to typeset Dostoevsky's \u0411\u0462\u0421\u042B (now
      \u0411\u0415\u0421\u042B). My suggestion is to base |\u0462| on |\u042A| with
      its bar prolonged to the right (IMHO cutting its right edge like this: /====\\
