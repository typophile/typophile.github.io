body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm making a logo for a female choir consisting of five women.
  They usually sing choir versions of various pop songs. The name is spanish and means
  \"with cream\" suggesting that they are that little extra, coffe with cream as an
  example.\r\n\r\nThis my first rough scetch of a possible version. The five notes
  represent the five members of the group. Tried some colours as well.\r\n\r\nFeedback
  much appreciated\r\n\r\npeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/concrema_v1_5801.2.jpg]"

  body: Yellow on white is a little too light to my eyes. Also Cr looks a little too
    much like a O.

  body: "yes, maybe the \"r\" needs to be sharper at its top right curve or it needs
    to be more condensed over all. It just connects so tightly to the shape of the
    C.\r\nAnother solution would be to have the ascender height be further from the
    x height  so the opening of the C is more prominent. \r\n\r\nIts bugs me a bit
    that the right half of the \"m\" is larger than the left.\r\n\r\nBesides that
    I think the heaviness of the strokes look nice and well balanced. The forms flow
    well together. \r\n\r\nMaybe try a few variations with the notes too. Maybe some
    are connected by a bar like eith notes. You may have already done that.\r\n\r\nGreat
    start."

  body: "Yeah I noticed that \"Cr\" looks like an O, need to do something about that.
    Thanks for the other type suggestions Pentapus, I didn't react on the \"m\" before
    but yeah it looks a little odd. Have to see if I can make it more balanced.\r\n\r\nWorking
    on some note variations and some other versions with another type.\r\n\r\nthanks."

  body: "The notes seem a bit too much like clip art to me. It also makes everything
    just so obvious. I think it would be more interesting without them.\r\n\r\npenn"
