  Weltin (born 1969) is a graphic designer specializing in type design, logos and
  logo lettering. He started his first typeface [[Finnegan]] in 1995 as a student,
  which was later published by Linotype in 1997.\r\n\r\nHe worked as an employed graphic
  designer in Germany and later as type designer for [[The Foundry]] in London. After
  deciding to settle in Germany he began working in his own studio.\r\n\r\nIn 1999
  he was awarded the D&AD award for the telephone book typeface [[Yellow]] for British
  Telecommunication plc. which he started in February 1998 for The Foundry and that
  needed to be finished in only three months. In 2001 he received Certificates of
  Excellence in Type Design both for Linotype Finnegan and Yellow by bukva:raz! international
  type design competition.\r\n\r\n[[Balega]], a stencil-like display font, was designed
  in 2002. Balega's letters are very bold, and have a slight italic slant. While some
  of the uppercase forms appear somewhat sharp, the lowercase is definitively round
  and friendly. Text set in Balega has a very forward moving motion giving the typeface
  a very dynamic feel.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Linotype published his large humanist sans serif
  type family [[Agilita]].\r\nWith his wonderful wife and two daughters he lives in
  a house south of Munich, Bavaria. He claims to be the fastest type designer on a
  bicycle.\r\n\r\n<external link:>External link:</external link:>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typematters.de\">type
