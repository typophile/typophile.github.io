    you suspect plagiarism please report it to MyFonts, and then please report back
    here. BTW it's nice that MyFonts has a reporting mechanism, eh? On Dafont for
    example the \"moderators\" are often the worst ones...\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=licinia_aged\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=ballpark_weiner&text=Fixed+Barcelona\r\n\r\nSo
    have you finally started caring about plagiarism, or are you pointing out an example
    simply to claim that plagiarism is OK?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    looks a whole lot like Bauer Bodoni with a negativ stroke added and some mods.\r\nThe
    designer\u2019s other fonts (on MyFonts) are all geometric constructions which
    makes this one even more probable to not being drawn from scratch. Wouldn\u2019t
    you agree? In other cases this would have made your nose tingle or something."

    Show an overlay with Bauer Bodoni... like I did with Cuprum* but you ignored (except
    I won't ignore you).\r\n2) Report it to MyFonts (and then please report back here).\r\n3)
