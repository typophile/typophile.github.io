  body: "There is also the almost identical NuSwift which uses Old style figures.
    I had Linotype listed as a supplier, but don't find it there. It's been mentioned
    in discussions at Typophile, and I have a sample in the Serif Guide that was made
    for me by a sample donor.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    2.0]]. It has 24 weights, including SC + OSF.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
