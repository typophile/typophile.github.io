body: I am very interested in magazine layout, esp. for photo documentaries, photo
  essays, travel stories and related subjects. Is there something like a &#34;best
  of&#34; collection of magazine covers or magazine spreads &#40;in pdf&#41; available
  on the internet? I&#39;ve checked out the SPD page but there was not a whole lot...  <BR>
  <BR>Many thanks for any input in advance! <BR> <BR>-Armin
