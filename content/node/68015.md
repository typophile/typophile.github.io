body: I've searched for this font (image below) but what it is continues to elude
  me. This font looks identical to Mailart Rubberstamp, but does not have eroded edges
  and corroded interior; it is a solid smooth font, but I can't figure out what it
  actually is, or if it is just a modified Mailart Rubberstamp. Anyone got any clues
  to what it might be?
