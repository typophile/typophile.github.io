  all,\r\n\r\nI would be much obliged if you could help identify the typeface in these
  samples. Closest I can come up with is Akzidenz Grotesk, but this seems quite different,
  particularly in certain letters like \"r\" and \"b\". In general, it seems a bit
  fuller, almost monoline.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!"

    there are differences when comparing to Berthold\u2019s version(s) or even Linotype\u2019s
    Basic Commercial.\r\nHow old is this stuff? Could it be old woodtype? "
