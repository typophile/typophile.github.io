  the project.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to get some feedback while working on the
  typeface so far I have done the lower-case and plan on working on the upper-case
  next. OnceIi have done that I will go back to the lower-case as a lot of the curves
  are far from perfect.\r\n\r\nAlso please note I haven't done any kerning yet as
  this is something I need to research first.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this typeface
  where early sketches of Futura, Bauhaus and Univers. Please let me know if it looks
  too similar to any of these fonts as i wanted to use them as inspiration and not
  to look exactly the same.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/may2013-01_3531.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/may2013-02_4137.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/may2013-03_6440.png]"

  body: "There have been many revivals of that historic \"font style\". What's your
    plan for making yours relevant? Without simply throwing in a gimmick...\r\n\r\nAlso
    (assuming you want this look refined, as opposed to \"faux na\xEFve\") you'll
    need to modulate the joins. For starters, closely compare your \"a\" to the one
    in Futura.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "As a first type-face this is good for starters. Don't let Sir Hrant scare
    you off. :-)\r\n\r\nThis has been done a lot, so be minded to carefully refine
    this. Focus a lot on the space between letters. That will help this go from just
    another historical Bauhaus face to great! :-)\r\n\r\nI agree with Hrant on the
    joins. Check out <a href=\"http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\">this
    site</a>, and try to apply those principles on your font. Also notice the where
    two lines join each other (for instance as on the |r| or |m|) the lines are thinned
    out. Take heed also to thinning the horizontals vs. the verticals.\r\n\r\nCan't
    wait to see more!"
