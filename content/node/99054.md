  body: "Thanks Special-K! It's really close isn't it? \r\n\r\nThere are other slight
    differences though, which makes me think this might be an actual font. e.g. The
    \"s\" (which does look almost exactly like an Anna \"5\") has slightly rounded
    corners. Also the Anna \"e\" and \"b\" are different -- the horizontal strokes
    cross the vertical ones.\r\n\r\n"

    sorry I don't how old it is but I believe Mike F has identified in spite of my
