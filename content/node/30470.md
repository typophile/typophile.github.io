    this will up the ante for every other carrier and handset maker in the user experience
    area.\r\n\r\nAsvetic, yes, it's true in the desktop PC world, but that is very
    rarely the case in the mobile/wireless industry... Handset manufacturers have
    no choice but to develop their UI to a carrier's specs. What is very different
    here is that Apple is the only manufacturer on a tier 1 US carrier that has no
    evidence of a Cingular UI. Not even Sony Ericsson (IMO, they have the coolest
    handsets available in the US) can say that.\r\n\r\nOne of the most exciting moment
    during the keynote was seeing the NYTimes in a browser on the phone and realizing
    the fonts were in Georgia. That's a breakthrough -- seeing web content on a mobile
    device without dumbing it down. (Of course, Cingular is on EDGE, not 3G, so you'll
    have to wait for it longer.)\r\n\r\nThe other great moment was seeing the pinch
    feature (using multi-touch) -- move two fingers to stretch or shrink an image.

    UI however. For example the Samsung D900: <a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/Samsung_SGH_D900_Black_carbon/4505-6454_7-32135435.html\">Black
    Carbon</a>\r\nThough this mobile phone is an unlocked international model, and
    the Apple iPhone has a specific contract with Cingular, it's still possible to
    create enriched User Interfaces if you have sole control of both aspects. \r\n\r\nI
    also agree with the \"pinch feature\" and will expect Apple to fit that into more
    of their products in the future. I could see it in an iMac as an advanced touchscreen
    interface coupled with a keyboard and mouse. Or a yet to be disclosed Tablet Mac.

      other words; Apple boasts about 48 hours that the phone *so* runs OS X, but
      apparently, it doesn't, as my OS X (I don't know about yours) can run quite
      a lot of non-Apple programs. Actually, as many as I want. And I bet, your (non-smart)phone
      can do this too, see Java. This is just insane. They bring a gadget with like,
