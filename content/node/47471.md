  body: "Really? The SERIF typeface used for \"OBAMA'08\"?\r\n\r\nThey used to use
    Perpetua, I thought, but I guess they've changed it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Gotham is the sans serif used (and, I might add, is getting a ton
    of press). \r\nI'm trying to figure out the serif face.\r\nYes, at one time it
    was Perpetua but they have indeed changed it.\r\nIt looks so familiar, I can't
    believe I don't have it. Looks like a classic, no?\r\n"

  body: It's not Gotham. Gotham is the sans serif type used throughout their campaign
    materials.

    at least monthly, and I always forget.

  body: I think the original logo used Joanna. This looks new. It wasn't originally
    set in small caps.

  body: Naw, I don't think so H&FJ Requiem is more refined, with longer serifs, even
    in the Text version.

  body: I think the apex of the A doesn't match. Also, it 'feels' a bit off.

  body: Yeah, I'm with Bald Condensed on this one. Although it is possible they added
    a stroke, thus softening the edges and curves.

  body: "It's just HTF Requiem SC with slightly clipped-off serifs (though yeah, I
    think they must have added a slight stroke, given the roundness of that apex.)

    from the original title case Perpetua), on branding of the candidates:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rogerblack.com/blog/requiem_for_a_candidate\r\n\r\n"
