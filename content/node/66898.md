  of FF DIN</a> from Albert-Jan Pool and he had this to say:\r\n\r\n<cite>Erik Spiekermann
  saw the old DIN typeface on the market in two weights and he noticed that several
  designers began using it. And he thought: \u201Cwhy is this happening?\u201D These
  were leading designers, he saw them going on and he thought: \u201CHm, we should
  do something about it. Why do they use this unusable typeface? Let\u2019s ask someone
  who can make something useful out of it. Then it might work even better.\u201D </cite>\r\n\r\nMy
  question is, <strong>What, exactly, is Spikermann talking about, and why does he
  consider the old DIN typeface to be unusable?</strong>. \r\n\r\nI own DIN 1451 (Mittelschrift
  and Engschrift), as well as 30640 (light and condensed) from Adobe's Font Folio.
  Are these the weights in question?"

    recommended to declare its predecessor as unusable ;)\r\n\r\nFrom a contemporary
    typographer\u2019s / type designer\u2019s POV, there are some readability issues
    with the original DIN 1451 typefaces, e.g. its contrast, the clumsy forms, etc.\r\n\r\nDid
    you also read the articles linked at the bottom of the page? Really, it\u2019s
    all in there, especially here:\r\nhttp://www.magwerk.com/mag.php?magazine=encore&language=en&issue=15&page=76\r\n\r\nThat
    said, even nowadays, with all the \u201Cnew\u201D versions of DIN around, a lot
    of designers still prefer the old, clumsy one for posters, headlines etc."
