    Can they put you in touch with the designer? IDing a distorted sample of an italic
    is not easy.\r\n\r\nDo you have more (larger) samples?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I made the following sample by playing around with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bookman-old-style/|Bookman
    Old Style]] italic. I know it isn't exact, but maybe this approach would be close
    enough. Most people (including me) I think have trouble recognizing italics, so
    my thought is that being close would be good enough.\r\n\r\nUnless I am comparing
    them side by side, I don't think I would have known that they were changed, but
    I know some others here would disagree. I just don't think the people looking
    at the ads are likely to be type experts.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maisfelizSIM_6585.gif]"

    they don't have nothing, that's the thing. But the Bookman Old Style is close
    enough to use.\r\nAgain, thanks very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPedro Henrique"

  body: "You are welcome.\r\n\r\nTo recreate what I did you will have to condense
    the type but open the tracking (spacing), and also increase the slant of the italic.
    I know this is a crude way to fake it, but I think you needed a quick solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n-
