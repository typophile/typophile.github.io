body: "Hello everyone, this is the very first font I post on the forum.\r\n\r\nI created
  Gaffel after an intership I did in Oslo. It was inspired by the many sculptures
  you can find in the town, especially those that were put in almost wild places,
  and the handmade posters in shops and small restaurants. I liked the idea of creating
  a font directly from the paper you use to write, reflecting how you make scupltures
  out of huge blocs of granite. So I used a cutter to draw the letters on paper and
  their shapes depend entirely on the movements of my hand. I'm left-handed, that
  is why most curves are on the left side of the glyphs.\r\nI first made a simple
  version to be used like stamps in clay, then I played with ligatures and open-type
  on Fontlab. Some shapes were difficult to get right because of hte restraint of
  the technique (I can't have negative spaces).\r\n\r\nTell me what you think of it!
  It's complete but I'm sure there are things to improve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Update 14th
  April:</strong> There is now a pdf version showing the font. It should be better.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gaffel_web_5538.jpg]"

    in lieu of jpgs. Most people here, myself included, prefer to see type in as much
    detail as possible. \r\n\r\nBeing an Osloite, I'm curious of which statues you're
    referring to. Also, bonus points to you for taking an interest in Ynglinga saga
    and Old Norse. "

  body: "Hi Sindre!\r\nThank you so much for posting. You're right, I will add a pdf
    version instead, jpg is wrong with curves. When I lived there for three months,
    I spent a lot of time in the Vigeland park. I must have taken hundreds of pictures
    of the statues. I find his work so sensitive and it's almost impossible considering
    the size and the massive proportions of the artist's \"models\". Yet there is
    so much emotion going on, something really woke up inside me. Maybe because their
    attitudes are so human. \r\n\r\nI also liked Bygdoy (sorry for lack of o slash)
    because it's so easy to feel apart from the world there. There is a great abstract
    structure there that looks like a table with waves or a whirlpool. That is where
    I had the idea to carve my type in the material, to make it where it was supposed
    to stand.\r\nI lived in Kampen and was surrouded by small shops and vintage stuff
    where the information was painted or made of fabrics. So it surely had some effect."

    would be a market for it maybe.

  body: "Hello again, Pascaline. \r\n\r\nI'm afraid I can't give much detailed advice
    on your typeface, I'm only into non-display faces myself, and have never made
    anything more daring than [[http://typophile.com/node/81129|this]]. \r\n\r\nI
    think you have succeeded in capturing something vaguely Norwegian, though I can't
    quite point my finger to it. What I would like to challenge you on, is to make
    this a whole lot more irregular. Draw it again without a single straight line.
    Make the stems uneven. Challenge the baseline, the x-height and the cap height.
    Make corners soft and uneven. Make the glyphs look more like twigs. Have another
    look at the Medi\xE6val runes.  \r\n\r\nUse the restrictions of your concept more
    to your advantage. Make the difference between the black counterspaces and the
    apertures less obvious. Or more obvious. Be bolder and more timid. \r\n\r\nI hope
    you don't feel I'm tearing your typeface completely apart. I'm not, I'm just being
    (too) honest because I see some potential in here that I think is not quite fulfilled.
    \r\n\r\nBygd\xF8y's indeed a treat. I hang out a lot there in summer. Did you
    see the work of Gustav Vigeland's younger brother [[http://www.emanuelvigeland.museum.no/index.htm|Emanuel]],
    by the way? If not, next time you're in Oslo, that's compulsory. "

  body: "No Sindre, I haven't seen Emanuel's work. I have seen many things but don't
    remember hearing about this museum. Yes, I definitely need to come again and visit
    what I missed!\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback. I understand what you mean and
    it could actually be a way to propose variations of the typeface, considering
    I won't have italics. I could play with width and black letters. When I did my
    first version, I saw something aproaching Medi\xE6val runes and it worked because
    all letters had the same x-height. I also used it on clay after I made sculpted
    letters and keeping the x-height helped to maintain a staight line in the text.
    You can see an exemple below.\r\n\r\nHei Frode Frank, does that mean that you
    like it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snakke_poster_6136.jpg]"
