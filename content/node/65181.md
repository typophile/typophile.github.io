  (I've already opted for Adobe Caslon Pro) with a good American sans serif. The content
  I'm working with requires both be able to handle small caps. Not a problem for Caslon
  Pro, but I was working with Franklin Gothic up until I realised it doesn't have
  small caps, well not the version I have anyway.\r\n\r\nWould anyone care to recommend
  some to me? I'd be very grateful if you could.\r\n\r\nThanks very much.\r\n\r\nJono"

    Sans</a>, with its recently added small caps, might do the trick. \r\n\r\nAnd,
    while I understand that Caslon is considered quintessentially British, I would
    point out that Carol Twombly, an American AFAIK, designed Adobe Caslon Pro."

    check it out. I was aware that Carol Twombly designed Caslon Pro, but I'm not
    being that strict about it to be honest. It's a bit like us Brits still calling
    Jaguar a British car, when the company is owned by an Indian firm! Does anyone
    else have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nJono"

    I'm not sure either of them have OpenType versions. \r\nI'll plug <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/okay-type/alright-sans/\">Alright
    Sans</a> too, which has OpenType small-caps and is American."

  body: "Thanks guys! All your suggestions are great. I'm really liking Alright Sans,
    I think that might be a winner. Mr Eaves is great, but the low x-height might
    jar with what I'm working on. \r\n\r\nThanks very much for your suggestions guys."

  body: "If any version of Caslon qualifies as English, then surely American grotesques
    must also, as the grotesque style originated in England.\r\n\r\nWhat style of
    sans originated in the US?\r\nHow about the \"humanized geometric\"? e.g. Dwiggins'
    Metro or Bernhard Gothic? (Admittedly Bernhard/Kahn was German, but the face was
    published in the US while he was living and working there.)\r\nOr perhaps \"low-waisted
    art deco\", seen now in Neutraface.\r\nAlso consider ITC Highlander, by Brit Dave
    Farey, but closely based on the lettering of Oz Cooper."

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nYou really know your stuff. Thanks very much for your suggestions,
    but I'm not sure the humanised geometrics you suggested are right for my project,
    which has a strong political/international law base to the content. As much as
    I love a low-waisted art deco face, I think they wouldn't suit my content. Thanks
    though! \r\n\r\nSomething like Benton or Alright would be quite nice as my content
    is focusing on the political climate of the past ten years as a result of the
    war on terror, and those sans are quite recent. I might well end up choosing a
    European sans if it gives me the flexibility I need, but the project is for an
    ISTD brief and I really want to have informed choices and not just pick a font
    because I like it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Perhaps Gotham could be emblematic of US imperialism, as it was the Obama
    campaign face, and he, despite his Nobel prize, appears to be hooked on imperialism
    with his recent decision to send more troops to Afghanistan, rather than declaring
    peace. Gotham is also the face of the 9/11 memorial in New York.

    Obama's campaign face but I didn't know it was used on the 9/11 memorial. Gotham
    could be my new choice.\r\n\r\nThanks Nick!"
