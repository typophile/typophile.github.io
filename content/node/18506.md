body: "I've drawn a regular weight of a serif font I'm tinkering with. I'm happy with
  it, and now I want to create a light version. I've deboldened and scaled it to the
  proportions I want... but I obviously want to maintain the consistency with the
  regular. Is there any way of taking the outlines from the regular and turning all
  the characters in that, to masks in the new light? or do I need to go through and
  do each one manually? I'm shuddering at the thought that python is needed here...
  \r\n\r\ncheers ears"

    FontLab, highlight all characters you want to put in the mask layer and hit Ctrl+M
