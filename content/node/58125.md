  body: It's incredbly close to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/felt_tip_roman/?&sample_text=CRANBERRY%20ORANGE%20SCONE%20%241.95&sample_size=24">Felt
    Tip Roman</a>. In fact, the $1.95 is Felt Tip Roman, but the rest is not. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/handwriting_fonts/">Here
    are some other options.</a>
