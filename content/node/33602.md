  Do You Wish You'd Been Told Before You Left School</a>, I thought I'd start a similar
  thread.\r\n\r\nI'm sure everyone has some insightful bits of wisdom they'd like
  to share with the next breed of designers and artists that are being released into
  the real world. \r\n\r\nSome inspiring bits of linkage I've crossed upon over the
  past few years since graduating have been:\r\n\r\nCameron Moll's <a href=\"http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000036.html\">8

    Andrew, I'm often surprised at which threads take off and how others fall flat.
    I thought this one would have ran for a while.\r\n\r\nOh well, ignorance is bliss,
    apparently.\r\n"

  body: "Advice: Pick your battles and check your ego at the door. Not everything
    you design will end up in your portfolio. Clients will d**k you around and muck
    up your designs and ask you to do things you think are awful, but they're the
    ones with the money. You have to decide which ones are worth the fight, and when
    it's best to just give them what they want. You are not in charge, unfortunately,
    as long as they are paying you.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of talented designers out
    there and if you have too much attitude the clients will turn elsewhere."

  body: "Here's another one: have a contract or some sort of written agreement before
    you start working on a job. Include some sort of kill fee (usually a percentage
    of the final fee) in case you start the job and you & the client find you can't
    work together.\r\n\r\nI try to break down contracts into the various components
    of the job, both because it tends not to freak the client out as much as a bottom
    line total and also in case the scope of the job changes - it's more clear what
    you are owed for work you've done."

    There has to be some insightful tips still left.
