  body: "This is essentially a credit card imprint - the same digits as are embossed
    on many credit cards.\r\nHere is an emulation (quite a bit bolder) - see the LARGE
    Numbers in [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wundes/caard/|this font, Caard]].  There
    are other credit card imprint fonts used; some are available.\r\n\r\nBTW - WhatTheFont
    found this with no problem. You have to give it an image without extraneous borders,
    which the .png file had. Had to edit the image and 'flatten' it.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
