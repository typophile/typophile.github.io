  and I have chosen [http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Expletus+Sans|Expletus
  Sans] ad a display face. I am now looking for a serif companion for body text. I
  have tried [http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Droid+Serif|Droid Serif] but
  I am not really sure. What do you think about this pair? Have you got some other
  font in mind that I could try?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
