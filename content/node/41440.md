  Planning on using Swift for text, and looking for a modern, crisp font for headlines..."

  body: Maybe Big Vesta, but Swift and Oranda have such strong serifs and a personality
    that shows through in smaller sizes. I don't really know of any sans that would
    hold up well and match the flavor. But, you know your project and design, the
    proposed sizes of type etc.
