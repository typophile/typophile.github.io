  body: "The typeface was Truffles - a transfer lettering font by Judy Frye Pearsall,
    1986.\r\n\r\nI assume, without hunting it down, that Trifles is a ripoff of Truffles

  body: "Good find Mike. Judy Pearsall might not have been a top font designer like
    Alan Meeks but I would give her college days design an A for originality and would
    not label it as \"Some deranged variation of Chesterfield,\" [Kevin's phrase].\r\ndon"
