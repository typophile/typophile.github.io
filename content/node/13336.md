body: "\"Photobar,\" a photo-software company, is going to introduce a new in-store
  kiosk where you can take in your digital camera's memory card and insert it into
  the computer and print out your photos. They want to market to middle-aged Midwesterners.\r\n\r\nThe
  original of the name \"Photobar\" is that the company wants their kiosks to be like
  a bar, as in \"pub\" or \"liquor cabinet\" or something. That's all I've got to
  work with.\r\n\r\nI've got 9 directions, none too-too worked out, mostly because
  it's hard to work just on form without knowing if what you're doing is anywhere
  near expectations. That said, you can critique based strictly on form or offer ideas
  that could make \"Photobar\" look more like Photobar.\r\n\r\nMuch thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nMy
  favs are 9, 1, and 7."

    rectangle and maybe soften the edges. I'm sure you know the type needs work, it
    needs more character. \r\n\r\nOne other thought, you might do something with the
    LED screen that digital snapshot cameras use. The reason number 9 doesn't work
    is there is no film. Its an icon of a past era for your clients technology."

  body: "Of your favorites, I like number 1 the best.\r\n\r\nBut I like 4 and 8, too.
    Four looks so old fashioned, but I like that. I have a feeling that the client
    might want something in the direction of 8's kitsch.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "I would avoid any reference to film or martini to avoid any confusion. I
    would also say that your demographic combined with the client's intention to make
    a bar might call for a serif/inviting face rather than the more mechanical/scientific
    feel of your sans choices. I like the icon in number 1 but I think making the
    camera double as a P as well (if that's what you intended, if not I'm reading
    too much into it) is not working.\r\nTim"

    the old film reels, so I have to leave them in. I might show the martini glass
    just because.\r\n\r\nI like #5 now.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments. It's hard
    to see these things with a critical eye when you've been staring at them so long!"

  body: "The 'make it like a bar/pub' just doesn't make any sense. Shouldn't they
    make it like a 'friendly digital photo printing kiosk'?\r\n\r\nI'd move away from
    any film reference and maybe focus on photo references. Also, consider using some
    more fluid faces. \r\n\r\n<em>The client wanted to see the old film reels, so
    I have to leave them in. I might show the martini glass just because.</em>\r\n\r\nHelp
    your client think through this. Point out the obvious...that anyone using a digital
    camera is using it to get rid of the film, and that processing family photos has
    absolutely nothing to do with downing a martini. For the demographic, it seems
    that the core emphasis should be on things like 'fast' and 'easy to use'.\r\n\r\nOf
    the ones you showed, #5 is definitely the one I'd go with.\r\n"

  body: The major problem with this job is that I'm contracting for a web developer
    (we're making the website also) and he's the client liaison. I'm getting my info
    2nd hand and have unsuccessfully lobbied to talk with the client. In a perfect
    world I'd have more info, but sometimes you just gotta get the job done. Eh. The
    martini glass is my visual attempt to make them realize how dumb of an idea it
    is. Let's hope it works.

  body: "I agree with aluminum. Also, I recommend ignoring the hell out of the bar
    theme* and just designing a strong logo for a digital photo kiosk. The name says
    bar, and I imagine the kiosk design will be bar-ish. Since you're so removed from
    the core issues, I'd just try stay away from the obviously shaky ideas.\r\n\r\nPreventing
    you from contacting the client directly is, frankly, asinine. And probably has
    nothing to do with you and everything to do with ass-covering on someone else's
    end. But you probably already knew that. I just get rankled when I hear about
    silly client-side runarounds like that.\r\n\r\n*The client will love the most
    bar-like logo, as it reaffirms their judgement."
