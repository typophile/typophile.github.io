  body: "The stars bug me; they are drawn with different styles (one flat, one dimensional)
    and they seem redundant. Might be better if there was a way to make it work with
    just one star. \r\n\r\nAlso I don't particularly care for the swashes (or whatever
    you'd call them), but if you're going to use them a curve would fit the globe
    better, right now they seem to have a fold."

    the text size to this\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/13_6508.png]\r\n\r\nabout
    looking folded, I don't intent to change it as for right now. I'm more concern
    about the color combination. Thanks for the critiques!"

  body: "Feedback on your concept.\r\n\r\nClipart overkill! Suggestion: you could
    make it a lot simpler by sticking to the rising star concept.\r\n\r\nDo people
    often refer to the summit as WAS? Or do you want them to? Because if not, why
    not just stick with the full name. (No more scaling problems either.)"
