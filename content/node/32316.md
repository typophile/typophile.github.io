  body: "Even though  its letterforms are flatter, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fsd/sys/\">Sys</a>
    has the most similar structure, in terms of letters like the C, g, y and t. Hoefler's
    <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/gothamrounded/index.html\">Gotham
    Rounded</a> has more structural differences, but I am not sure if it has many
    differences from the custom version for Print magazine.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
