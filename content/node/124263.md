body: "Myriad is our corporate typeface. I would like to replace it with something
  more contemporary and friendly. \r\n\r\nAlright Sans is the current contender. Its
  grotesque nature, clean junctions and tall x-height are appealing. I find the open
  aperture and shallow bowl of the lowercase \u2018a\u2019 especially pleasing. Unlike
  Myriad, Alright Sans has eight weights and small caps.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"
