  body: "You can use Adobe Illustrator to make it.\r\n\r\nmake an oval or star outline
    or any shape outline you like\r\n\r\nright click on shape- transform- rotate\r\n\r\nexperiment
    with degrees, i would start small if you want it to look like those, 3 or 4 degrees\r\nhit
    Copy, NOT ok, this will create a copy, rotated a few degrees\r\nhit command(mac)/control(pc)
    and 'd' - this will repeat the action.\r\n\r\nkeep hitting cmd 'd' until you are
    happy!\r\n\r\nI hope this helps, im sure there are better ways or software but
    this will work"
