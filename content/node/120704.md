  body: "Ricardo, the image sample you uploaded looks like an actual handwritten signature
    - not a font, \r\nso it's very difficult to guess which font you have used.\r\n(look
    at the 2 very different |o| occurrences of your sample)\r\nDo you have any other
    samples?"

  body: The original poster seems to be saying that this IS his signature; but he's
    looking for the font that looks (sort of) like his signature.

  body: I ran ran this through Find My Font (just as did Fivos) at various up samples
    and combos of letters - nothing even close. This hand done signature does not
    seem to have a script font equivalent.
