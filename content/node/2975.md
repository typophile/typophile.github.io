body: ever have dreams about typography or type design? <BR> <BR>i had my first one
  last night; at least one i actually remembered.  <BR> <BR>most of my dreams are
  really short snippits, as was this one. i was looking through some book about typography,
  and came across an &#34;example&#34; paragraph set in clarendon. i remember having
  this discussion in my mind about how clarendon was some sort of breakthrough typeface
  of vast historical significance. then i woke up. pretty odd.  <BR> <BR>i now have
  confirmation that i am a nerd.

    That night he had dreams he was trying to walk through his living room, but he
    had enabled the &#34;snap-to-guides&#34; function, so he kept slamming into furniture
    he wandered to close to.

    in WordPerfect. It was a labor intensive project. I would go home at night, turn
    the tele on to unwind. I remember one night going home switching the tv on, laying
    down on the couch and relaxing my eyes. I opened them up only to see my monitor
    with thousands of edits that I missed. I kept reaching for the keyboard that would
    appear on my lap to correct these things, but the keyboard kept vanishing.  <BR>

    hours. Laurence Penney described walking down the street after several days of
    hinting, and seeing a tree as a pixel pattern. Immediately his brain started working
    out the most efficient way to move one of the branches further away from another
    to improve the image.

    Flatland, by Edwin Abbot? <BR>Written, I think, around 1880, its about a 2D world
    populated by shapes, then a 3D volume appears from another dimension and shakes
    up the shapes&#39; world. <BR>Its heavy with Victorian social commentary. There&#39;s
    a strict hierarchy in Flatland &#40;the more sides you have the higher up you
    are - but in a 2D world, the shapes can&#39;t see each other from above, so they
    have to judge the number of sides by finding a corner and checking the angles.
    Women are bottom of the pile, so they are, I think, just lines&#41;. I read it
    a very long time ago, for an undergrad essay I was writing, but I can&#39;t remember
    much of it &#40;or even what f&#42;cked up type of essay I was writing in which
    this wierd book could play a part&#41;. <BR>If you&#39;re interested, its around
    $2 at most online bookstores, or there&#39;s an online version here <a href="http://www.alcyone.com/max/lit/flatland/"

    I checked Liungman&#39;s comprehensive &#34;Dictionary of Symbols&#34; and saw
    that although your lefthand shape has parts of both Saturn and Antimony &#40;a
    crucial component of metal type!&#41;, it&#39;s pretty much exactly the symbol
    &#40;actually one of many&#41; for Mercury &#40;more the material than the planet&#41;.
    Your righthand shape didn&#39;t come up, but it looks a lot like a Courier rendition
    of the first... Were you working a lot on a sans/slab superfamily?  :-&#41; <BR>

    sans monospaced families, and a very playful serif version of the family I mentioned
    above. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be happy to do a screen grab of the previous days works
    to perhaps paint a visual timeline if anybody is interested . . . <BR> <BR>Regarding
    the Flatline story, I do recall a buddy mentioning that story to me in college
    as a quick anecdote and they way he described the ending really stuck with me

  body: Flatland is a must-read, especially since it&#39;s such a thin book there&#39;s
    no excuse not to. Various modern authors have written sequels to it, with varying
    degrees of success. Sadly, typography is an unknown art to Flatlanders, whose
    written language is necessarily one-dimensional.

    at the time, but I&#39;ve since come to understand. <BR> <BR>He also converted
    an alleyway into an office space for his studio and actually petitioned the city

    has become irretrievably altered. Now my dreams &#34;scroll&#34; vertically, instead
    of moving left to right as I remember they used to do.  <BR> <BR>Lately, I was
    hand drawing a thumbnail on a piece of paper. Then off to the bottom left corner
    &#40;as if it were the pasteboard&#41;, I drew a bit that I had every intention
    of moving over to the center. I actually stuck the pencil in the middle, held
    it down, and was momentarily surprised when my side scribble didn&#39;t click
    and drag.  <BR> <BR>Similarly, I&#39;ve drawn thumbnails and gotten pissed that
    I couldn&#39;t &#34;send to the back.&#34;  <BR> <BR>As I age and move into perimenopause,
    there are ever increasing numbers of floating pallets to deal with. That&#39;s
    a deadly combo to my brain cells.  I started noticing this 5 versions of Freehand
    ago. Now I&#39;m convinced InDesign is going to land me in a nursing home.

    migrate to our physical interfaces - probably due to the amazing adaptability
    of the human brain. <BR> <BR>&#62; was momentarily surprised when my side scribble
    didn&#39;t click and drag. <BR> <BR>One time I was working on a scan of a photo
    laying to the left of the keyboard. I was trying to show a coworker some difference
    between the scan and the original - with the mouse I pointed to the area on the
    scan, then I proceeded to try to roll the pointer off the bottom-left of the screen
    to the physical photo on the table. I actually got angry for a second when it
    wasn&#39;t working. <BR> <BR>And it&#39;s not just software, but anything you
    spend a lot of time with. When I used to have a motorcycle, riding it more than
    I&#39;d walk, I used to catch myself looking to my left &#40;where the mirror
