    to the Solotype Catalog. I think there are other digitizations of it as well.\r\n\r\n-

  body: It's available as Holly both from URW and on the 24 Script and Cursive Display
    Fonts CD from Dover. Both of those, however have the original's lower x-height.
    For that reason, I think that only Quigley Wiggly is a match. That t, by the way,
    appears to have been made from parts of QW's T and the l or t.
