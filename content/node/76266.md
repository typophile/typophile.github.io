  discern where the weak points of this thing are.\r\n\r\nAnybody care to give me
  a little backup? Any kind of help appreciated!\r\n\r\nVoil\xE0:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/milchhausle_blacks_5941.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/milchhausle_outlines_5772.jpg]"

  body: "I really like. The inktrap-like joints look very much organic :-)\r\n\r\nThe
    part that IMO may need a bit of tweaking is the \"..us..\". The /u/ looks almost
    vertical, and /s/ appears to have a negative slant (and by that perhaps contributing
    to how /u/ looks)."

  body: "Thanks for you reply, Alex.\r\n\r\nThe diverting slant in the \"u\" results
    from the initial construction, which was based on the way you would write a u
    with joined up writing, as a series of loops, hence the slight thickening of the
    u's bars.\r\n\r\nI will straighten that and see it how it comes out.\r\n\r\nregarding
    the s, the hook shape is a regional thing. People learn to write it like that
    in elemetary school, so I thought I might add that to incorporate some of the
    local peculiarities.\r\n\r\nTo straighten that thing out, I think I would have
    to add a \"second storey\" to the thing.\r\nNot to thrilled about that beforehand
    but maybe the result will change my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvice much appreciated,
    thank you!"

    sure about the s, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think."

  body: I prefer the original s, partly because its similar to how I draw it with
    a brush. I can see very slight differences in the two h's and I think you should
    exaggerate those a bit more. You don't want people to think you've used a font!
    The a & u still look a little heavy. Use the c as a model for a.

  body: "Hi Justin!\r\nI had started out with equal thickness, but as the hind part
    of \"h\xE4usle\" has a lot less ascenders than the front part, it came out much
    brighter in my printouts, so I increased the line width of those three letters
    a little bit to make them compete against the others better.\r\n\r\nWill definitely
    play up on the differences between the hs, though. Good advice, much appreciated! "
