  body: It's pretty unusual in continuous text, if for no other reason (and there
    are others) than that it takes up more vertical space.

  body: I think indentation is more common, both to save space and also because it
    can make baseline alignments between columns easier. But there are examples of
    magazines using space between paragraphs; Communication Arts magazine, for example.

  body: Do spaced paragraphs generally feel more in-tune with sans serifs, and indented
    paragraphs with serifs? Or is it just me? I feel like that layout wouldn't work
    as well if it wasn't in a sans.

  body: I can see why it's so rarely used - if a break falls at the end of a column
    the break could be invisible. Thanks for the tip about <em>Computer Arts</em>
    magazine. Partly I'm determined to find at least one publication that does it,
    as it seems strange that absolutely no one does it.

    add a large decorated initial. But to sell cheaper copies some books never got
    the initial (although the missing letter was somehow added of course, often by
    simply <em>printing</em> it, sometimes at a tiny text size right in the middle
    of the gaping hole). Eventually that emptiness became acceptable style. Legacy
    junk.\r\n\r\nCertainly not every paragraph was intended to get a large initial,
    but I'm pretty sure indenting was not acceptable style before \"missing-initial-syndrome\"
    kicked in.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about the pilcrow is that you can start a new
    idea (the main -maybe only- point of a paragraph break) without wasting space

  body: "The paragraph indent is a legacy from the days when ideas were plentiful
    and paper was scarce, so publishers used every space-saving technique available
    (including justified right margins).\r\n\r\nPaper is ceasing to be a limiting
    factor on the publication of ideas, and ragged-right columns and extra space between
    paragraphs are becoming more common. But that didn't come about because of supply
    and demand.\r\n\r\nUntil the 1980s, the only way to get copy ready for publication
    (i.e., presented in typographic letterforms), was to pay a professional with years
    of training to enter the copy into a big, expensive typesetting machine. Part
    of the training those professionals got was the publishing standard of justified
    columns and indented paragraphs with no extra space between them.\r\n\r\nStarting
    in the 1980s, any fool with a desktop computer could put his (or her) copy into
    typographic letterforms, and thus render it ready for publication, sort of. First-generation
    word-processor users had never been trained as professional typesetters, but they
    had learned to type business letters on a typewriter, i.e., they had learned \"block
    style\": ragged right with an extra space between paragraphs. Word processing
    evolved into desktop publishing, bringing with it the default practices of the
    office typing pool, rather than the standards of professional typesetters. A vestige
    of this evolutionary path is that many people who've never seen a typewriter have
    a tendency to put two word spaces after the period at the end of a sentence."

    Lots of books. If you want a quick source, Updike covers a long time period and
    a lot of nationalities.\r\n\r\n@Victor. \r\n\r\nWell, the 1980s is perhaps an
    unfortunate choice for the date. The IBM strike-on composer had been in use for
    a while, and you *could* use a personal computer like the Xerox Star to drive
    a Linotron 202 (we did) by the mid-1980s, but PostScript was a child of the 1990s,
    and it wasn't really until the mid-1990s that \"desktop\" publishing\" was a viable
    option. \r\n\r\nMoreover, \"self publishing\" was still just another name for
    \"vanity publishing.\" But I take your point.\r\n\r\nTypesetters like me didn't
    become irrelevant until later. Actually, we're still not irrelevant if a publisher
    doesn't just rent their imprint, but uses it as a mark of professional work, of
    standards in selecting what to publish, editing, and manufacturing. \r\n\r\nSadly,
    you're probably right for the future -- publishing is becoming just another land
    populated by mid-level-managers, who tell you  they provide \"content\" when caught
    & questioned between their meetings.\r\n\r\nNone of our rantings changes the simple
    fact that the purpose of writing is to communicate, and (1) that requires an audience,
    and (2) it is rarely the designer's job to challenge that audience. \r\n\r\nAs
    I once told a designer who thought otherwise, you want to challenge the audience,
    write your own damn book. He didn't. And author's didn't like his work, I wonder
    why? So he took the only avenue left, teaching."

    professionals do it.  And so forth. \r\n\r\n(Not that I'd want to go back to the

    you happen to prefer. If I'm not challenging people I'm not happy. And the people
    who like my fonts like them at least partly for that reason. Same goes for designing

  body: "It's a plus and minus, James. I have to do more design work these days, too
    -- hard to find a good traditional designer... ;-)\r\n\r\nThe technology helps,
    thought, if you're willing to take the time. In type, true-cut superiors, small
    caps, etc., we can all now make the things for which we use to be at the mercy
    of the foundries. Spacing work can be done, even weight tweaking. Much of this
    can be done, or closely approximated,  in an  applications program like InDesign.\r\n\r\nThe
    biggest plus is black & white halftone work. You can now get an ICC graysale profile
    (well, sometimes you have to figure it out) for a particular printer and a particular
    paper. Often the printer doesn't know, but even here, there are standards. You
    lose some shadow detail if you can't get the \"exact\" profile. Truth to tell,
    they can only hold +/- three to five percent on press, which makes things a bit
    of a crap shoot.\r\n\r\nYou can then set up an inkjet in the office to essentially
    make b&w proofs that will be very close to what you'll get on press, and adjust
    your work accordingly. The same for color, of course, but it is harder, more work.
    For color, we set up to match the printers' laser proofer, and assume they can
    match their own proofer. If they can't, we all know where the blame lies...\r\n\r\nThe
    biggest problem is all the ham-handed tinkerers who go into the image in Photoshop
    & posterize things with their so-called adjustments, or clip the black/white points.
    Do your adjustments in layers, so the original image is unmodified. Flatten at
    the end, & write that off as a separate file. Save the original, working image
    file as a .pfd (NOT .pdf). If you have to send the image to a professional downstream,
    or adjust the image in proof, you'll be glad to have that .pfd with the original
