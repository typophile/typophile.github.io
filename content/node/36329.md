body: "An orphan is a very short line, usually a single word, which appears at the
  beginning of a page or column of text.\r\n\r\nThis condition is visually unbalanced,
  and therefore undesirable. In order to minimize the occurrences of orphans, typographers
  will often adjust line length, wording, or spacing in order to allow the text to
  flow in a more balanced manner."
