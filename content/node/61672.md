  to take a break before I finish [[http://typophile.com/node/61066|Mondegreen]]'s
  italics, to gain some perspective, so I had to do something else: A monospaced typeface,
  intended for screen viewing at small sizes. I always use monospace for coding and
  writing, preferably bitmap fonts. So this is an attempt to make an outline font
  that behaves like a bitmap at small sizes. I've eliminated all curves, and all angles
  are (as exactly as technically possible) 30, 45 or 60 degrees. \r\n\r\nI've tried
  it in the text editor NoteTab, and so far, it looks like my theory works. There's
  almost no blurring at size ten (with ClearType on), and it's actually perfectly
  readable at size five, much better than Courier New. I'll upload some screen captures
  later, if anyone's interested.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monomania_5484.png]\r\n\r\nEDIT:
  For some reason, the .png posted here gets blurred on upload, probably some image
  enhancement routine. The small type at the bottom looks sharp on my original .png.
  Bummer."

    but thanks to you, I now have his [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/vendetta/medium|Vendetta]]
    very high on my purchase list. That's a Venetian to my liking! I'd very much like
    to know more of the rationale of his lineal approach, not having found much on
    the net, though.  \r\n\r\nNick, yes, those zeds were horrible, I admit that. I
    can only blame them on sleep deprivation. I've made new and better ones, and I've
    also taken some weight off and done some fiddling on the exes, the \"f\", the
    kays and the \"t\". \r\n\r\n<cite>Don\u2019t you owe it to yourself to have 15
    and 75 degrees also?</em>\r\n\r\nI think they're both to close to the horizontal
    and the vertical to be of much use, really. And then I'd be tempted to make the
    \"curves\" much smoother, with four lines where I now have two. Too much work.\r\n\r\n<em>[...]
    a crazy 67.5 degree anomaly</em>\r\n\r\nThat's three sixteenths of a circle, isn't
    it? I now use circle sections of 1/16 (22.5\xB0), 2/16 (45\xB0) and 3/16 (67,5\xB0),
    and 1/12 (30\xB0) and  2/12 (60\xB0). I'd say that is pretty uncrazy geometry.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monomania2_5328.png]"

    sharp points, hard edges and straight lines to contrast with curves and softness,
    to create some tension to the smoothness, right? (This make me think of the counterpoint
    of polyphonic music.) I suppose this can be said to be true also for Vendetta,
    but not for Brothers, where the straight lines are used to define all curves,
    the same approach as in my experiment here.\r\n\r\n<cite>[...] the elusive Simona</em>\r\n\r\nElusive
    indeed, I have not been able to find a single specimen online. Can you help?"

    it twice, and I just want to say that this is one of the most qualified type reviews
    I've seen -- it's a pity that this isn't available to the general public anymore.
    Your focus on readability, based on (what seems to me as) factual knowledge on
    the matter, is very valuable to a wannabe type designer as myself -- and indeed
    to potential users of typefaces. I'm not sure that I entirely share your viewpoint
    that \"geometry is anathema to readability\", but as a starting point for a review
    of Vendetta, which on first eyesight can be conceived as some kind of \"geometric
    Venetian\", it is very fruitful. Thanks again for a good read.\r\n\r\nEr, this
    thread is getting highly off topic. I guess that's okay, since I started it --
    but I just want to say that criticism of my attempt at a Downer-style monospace
    is welcome."

  body: "Interesting. Reminds me of doodles I often make on graph paper, and of plotter
    lettering.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to know if the idea would hold together if
    you introduced some contrast into the face. I also wonder if some of the counters
    could \"skip\" an angle on their way around - could you get a kind of [[http://www.typophile.com/node/41687|\"cut
    and then curved\"]] effect? (speaking of Vendetta...) These are different directions
    than where you're going so far, of course.\r\n\r\nSome interesting subtle touches
    here, like having the chamfering on the terminals of s much smaller than, say,
    the top of t, so that those terminals have more solidity.\r\n\r\nYour 'f' has
    problems. it starts to curve over too low, but I imagine it's because you're trying
    to fill the monowidth slot with that hood. Even still, the letter sits too far
    left in its slot (\"handcraf ted\"). Could you somehow give more responsibility
    for its width to the crossbar instead of the hood? (Or does anybody ever give
    'f' a baseline serif in a monowidth font, as you've done with the 'l'?)\r\n\r\nDid
    you try a more (pseudo-)curved-top A?"

  body: "I couldn't agree more, breakneck fonting is good fun. Straight lines are
    great for roughing out letters and swashes. I often draw this way and then use
    the line->curve tool in fontlab to clean up afterward. Though I like the charm
    of rough letters at text size. A particular favorite of mine: Journal. Part of
    what made my quick project doable was that it was an italic, so copy and paste
    worked well. It'd be fun to try again and see if 2.5 years has sped me up or slowed
    me down. Hmmm... I'm envisioning a fast-forward screencast with clock.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    your project, looks nice! I've never wrestled with the particulars of a monospace
    so take the following with a grain of salt:\r\n\u2022 t: crossbar too far left?
    Shift it all to the right? \r\n\u2022 r: maybe deploy a small head serif, shift
    the stem right, and shorten the arm.\r\n\u2022 I wonder if a gif would similarly
    blur?\r\n\u2022 why do the angles matter? Seems like the shapes are what matter...
    am I missing something?\r\n\r\nBTW Mondegreen is also very nice. Century needed
    to be brought into this century. After geometric sans and slab serifs play out,
    Century will be king again. Haha probably not, but oh well. Cheers!"
