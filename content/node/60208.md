body: "Alright typophile, I work for a company that uses a bastardized version of
  Gill Sans as their corporate font. Seriously, they paid someone in the 90's to basically
  alter Gill Sans' quirky Ultrabold \"I\". \r\n\r\nThe problem as a part of the design
  team is that we have to work with a fractured and incomplete set of glyphs. It's
  a postscript version with no kerning pairs, ligatures or well...anything. It's just
  bad. \r\n\r\nI want to propose the complete set of Verlag as an alternative which
  is much more fresh and has a lot more flexibility in terms of OpenType. I chose
  it because it would allow the company's literature to transition a little more seamlessly
  rather than having to recreate everything at once.\r\n\r\nI've expressed these things
  to the higher-ups and they want (and are open to) a proposal. \r\n\r\nSo, what does
  typophile think of this idea? Can anyone else think of some advantages?"

  body: "Could you post some examples of what they did to the \"I\"?\r\n\r\nI imagine
    you can go on about need for linguistic support that OpenType will give you, since
    is a JCB is an international company. \r\nMaybe go into the benefits of using
    cross-platform fonts too.\r\n\r\nMaybe show them a few specific characters you
    are missing for other language support in your presentation. Show them too, side
    by side, text with & without of ligatures."
