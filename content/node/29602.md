body: "I am an illustrator who has become a regular reader of Typophile in order to
  learn as much about typography as I can. I have a great deal of respect for the
  knowledge-base that is open to sharing here on this board.\r\n\r\nI have designed
  a large-display emblem for a salon and I need your help on the text portion of the
  emblem. Currently, I am using Rosewood Fill; however, it is getting a little too
  much play these days and I would like to support a different font and its designer.
  I am aware of Cam, but it doesn\u2019t rock my world. I would like to go for something
  that complements the ornate emblem and personifies luxury. The font should work
  both within the emblem and on its own. I don\u2019t think Rosewod Fill works well
  on its own for a salon, at least not one that is high-end. Maybe I am asking too
  much for a font to work in both applications, so the more important application
  is in the emblem.\r\n\r\nMy second question is what font(s) do you think work well
  in this context to accompany the emblem? It should have the feel of luxury like
  a font that would work well in high-fashion. The font shouldn\u2019t compete with
  the ornateness of the graphic. Price is not an issue.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus question,
  I understand Rosewood Fill needs to be kerned manually, I have little knowledge
  of this other than what looks natural to me, so I ask you to critique the job I
  have done.\r\n\r\nI thank all of you who openly share your vast knowledge of typography
  here on this board. It greatly helps those of us who may be proficient in other
  areas, but lack when it comes to typopgraphy.\r\n\r\n"

    couple of threads with suggestions for elegant, luxury typefaces, I think a script
    would create the competition that you want to avoid.\r\n\r\nLooking at your mark
    I wonder if those scissors aren't a bit strong for the rest of the mark, they
    seem a little more like paper-cutting, general purpose scissors than hair-cutting
    which are thinner and more pointed. Maybe with a bit more detail to work with
    the swashy shield rather than silhouette. In terms of usefulness, I mean printing
    well at most sizes, I would consider placing the type outside the shield, below
    or to the side possibly. Your kerning looks good (difficult to see at the small
    size of you post) ALO is always going to present problems kerning, essentially
    what you are trying to achieve is to have visually similar spaces between characters,
    a good practice is to view the setting with a squint so you can see the spacing
    as a blur you should be able to pick out particularly dark or light areas.\r\n\r\nTim"

    the type does indeed look way too small! :-)  I'd make two lines out of it.\r\n\r\nAlso
    a suggestion concerning the illustration, if I may: that top-left feather\r\nis
    throwing things off. I might try making it thinner and more upright.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
