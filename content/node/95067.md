  body text should be when creating a book. Are there any methods or rules to work
  it out? Or is it just a matter of preference depending on the font? \r\n\r\nThanks! "

  body: There's no formula, but some factors that are particularly important to consider
    are the size of the page (or width of the text column) and the x-height and width
    of the font. Also budget constraints, printing method and paper choice, the kind
    of book you want it to look like and, as Riccardo mentioned, the target readership.
