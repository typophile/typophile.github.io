body: Okay, got one for you.  I have a client who wanted Engraver as the font choice
  on her card, and for a while that worked for her.  Now she wants lower case letters
  on her cards, and to my knowledge, I don't know of any variation of Engraver that
  has miniscule letters.   Does anyone know of one or can they recommend a passable
  substitute?  Thanks for any assistance.
