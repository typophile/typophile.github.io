body: "Greetings everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm currently taking my first typography class and
  part of our project is to conduct an interview with typographers which we will then
  present in class. Being more on the graphic side of art, typography is fairly new
  to me. However, after getting infected with my professor's enthusiasm (she even
  made us watch Helvetica while on her Helvetica T-shirt)I'm starting to take a deeper
  interest on the subject.\r\n\r\nIf there's anyone out there willing to extend his
  or her wisdom to an eager student, please post a reply and a way for me to contact
  you. In the meantime, I'll be thinking about the questions and exploring the rest
  of the site. Thank you for your time!"

    respond.

  body: Thanks for the suggestion, Miss Tiffany. I've thought about that too but the
    idea of just dropping questions and collecting them later makes me feel like I
    don't really care about the interview or the person I'm interviewing. Kinda like
    a survey. I want it to be a little more dynamic and interactive. :)

  body: "Just one thing: \r\nBe aware that people generally distinguish between typographers
    (people who use type) and type designers (people who design the typefaces themselves).
    You will find plenty of both here on Typophile.\r\nInterview questions to typographers
    might be different from those to type designers. Which exactly is your task \u2013
    an interview about typography or about type design?"

    said that to me at the office recently. It was hard to not laugh.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    Biinge, I would recommend researching a type designer you find especially interesting,
    find his contact information (it\u2019s usually on a web site somewhere) and request
    and interview. In my experience most type designers don\u2019t get pestered by
    students too often and are happy to help. You\u2019ll get a much more interesting
    interview this way because you can write your questions based on that designers
    body of work. "

  body: Hello everyone! Thanks for the help and advice. We were supposed to pick a
    font that we really like and try to get a hold of the designer for the interview.
    I love Scriptina font and tried (unsuccessfully) searching for Fred Nader but
    it led me to an old thread here basically saying there's no way to reach him.
    But what's more important about that particular thread is that it gave me an idea
    that there will be more substance to my project if I spent time talking to more
    than one person about typography/typographers/type designing. I'm kind of in the
    dark here since I have not the slightest idea as to how broad this subject truly
    is. I didn't even know there's a culture and counter-culture for Helvetica :P

  body: "Hi Mister Segalini, I need the interview for my Typography class presentation.
    But yes, I want to pursue a career in design and right now I'm a student majoring
    in Fine Arts: Advertising. We basically have to do an interview with a (master)
    typographer and deliver it to class. My professor said we should pick a font and
    try to get a hold of the artist. My favorite font is Scriptina and after some
    research, it turned out (I hope I'm not speaking taboo here) that the designer
    Frederick \"Apostrophe\" Nader was quite a controversial guy in the design scene.
    I'm actually digging through old web archives trying to find out as much about
    Mr. Nader and it dawned on me that the majority of my class would present a standard
    interview so I might as well do something different by talking about, say, font
    piracy and such as opposed to generic questions like \"When did you start designing
    type?\", \"Who were your influences?\" etc etc.\r\n\r\nThe reason I started a
    thread here was I was looking for voluntary help as it's quite hard to get replies
    from designers which is understandable. I appreciate everyone's help by the way.
    :)"
