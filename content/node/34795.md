  rejigging, or is there cause for concern?"

  body: As a long-time "lurker", a.k.a. guest, and now a "user" (sounds vaguely illegal),
    I can say that I spend a lot less time browsing the typophile site since the recent
    redesign, due to the extremely slow loading of pages. I don't know how it is with
    fast internet connections, but on a 56k dial-up account I can go downstairs and
    make a coffee while I'm waiting.

  body: "This has already been explained in two or three other threads, but I think
    it is worth saying it again here.\r\n\r\nTypophile runs on slightly out-of-date,
    donated server space from Media Temple. Because Typophile is now serving up millions
    of pages per day, for thousands of users (based on current site statistics), we
    are experiencing slow load times. The past few days have been especially painful
    because of the upgrade. In contrast to what some may think, we are currently shopping
    around for a new hosting package that can support everyone's needs and make this
    site usable and enjoyable for all who visit. Unfortunately, this takes time and
    for a non-profit community whose contributers work mostly in their spare time,
    it might not happen as quickly as we'd like. It is frustrating for all of us,
    but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel and we hope you will too.\r\n"

  body: There are a few factors that have influenced this change. The previous codebase
    looked at all of the unique visitors from the last 45 minutes. We reset this during
    the upgrade to 15 minutes, which reduces the number of guests more significantly
    than logged in users, since logged in users tend to visit the site more consistently.
    Probably the most significant difference, however, is that we curtailed a few
    unruly bots that were eating more than their fair share of page views. If you
    haven't noticed, the site performance has increased significantly since we told
    these bots to shoo.

  body: Our human traffic has dropped a little as well since our post launch bot invasion
    slowdown. :( I think that all the search engines, as well as some less useful
    spiders saw a bunch of new pages after the refresh and they all wanted some. I'm
    hoping that that all of our human friends will be back, though.
