  DOI: 10.3758/s13414-011-0220-9.\r\n\r\n<strong>Abstract</strong>\r\nLetter identification
  is a critical front end of the reading process. In general, conceptualizations of
  the identification process have emphasized arbitrary sets of distinctive features.
  However, a richer view of letter processing incorporates principles from the field
  of type design, including an emphasis on uniformities across letters within a font.
  The importance of uniformities is supported by a small body of research indicating
  that consistency of font increases letter identification efficiency. We review design
  concepts and the relevant literature, with the goal of stimulating further thinking
  about letter processing during reading."

    proceed. While one may have a conscious appreciation of quirky letterforms, this
    appreciation will slow down processing time. So, which is more important: aesthetics
    or information-gathering?'

  body: "Thanks, Dean. In my Beatrice Warde Memorial Lecture at St Brides a couple
    of years ago, I looked at 'the importance of uniformities', specifically with
    regard to spatial frequency, and suggested that the work of type design can be
    conceptually understood as 'manipulating relationships of sameness and difference'.
    I propose that most of the differences are 'given' in one way or another -- the
    necessary differences between individual signs that permit us to distinguish them,
    the differences between styles and weights, the differences between scripts --
    and hence that on balance we are mostly involved in \u2018making same\u2019 shapes
    with given differences, although there are specific instances of making different
    shapes that have built-in similarities.\r\n\r\nSlides from the talk here:\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/John/SameDifference-slides.pdf\r\n\r\n[Due
    to font embedding problems, some of the slides of student work are messed up.]"

    ago.\r\n\r\nI think Thomas Sanocki and Mary Dyson are right in wanting to stimulate
    thinking about the critical front end of the reading process and in relating current
    work in different research paradigms to principles from the field of type design.
    Good examples are the discussion of Denis Pelli and his associates\u2019 work
    on crowding and efficiency, the review of Peter Walker and Sanocki\u2019s work
    on font tuning and font-specific schematic tuning, the referencing of Fiset, Blais,
    Arguin and Gosselin, et. al.\u2019s work with classification images, and the section
    on the microgenesis in the time dimension of letter or word processing. \r\n\r\nSo
    I think it's an excellent paper, despite the fact that I think it's major premise,
    that letter identification is a critical front end of the reading process, ultimately
    hinders access to a potentially even richer type-friendly view and partially pre-empts
    the paper\u2019s stated goal of stimulating further thinking.\r\n\r\nThe paper
    states, \u201CIt is now clear that letter perception provides a critical front
    end for reading because letters are functional units \u2014 they are independent
    pieces of the word code,\" and references McClelland, 1976, Oden, 1984, Pelli,
    Farell, & Moore, 2003. All these authors clearly share the paper\u2019s perspective,
    yet Denis Pelli, Bart Farell, and Catherine Moore\u2019s central claim in \u201DThe
    remarkable inefficiency of word recognition\u201D and other papers is that the
    efficiency of word recognition is only what one would expect if information at
    the granularity of independant strokes were the pivotal functional units, and
    Jay McClelland, one of the authors of the interactive activation account has consistently
    held that, though the interactive activation scheme uses letters, this standard
    cognitive unit might not necessarily have to be reified in a model to make it
    work, as shown by the explanatory power of what he calls intrinsic integration
    models. (I'm not familiar enough with the work of Gregg Oden to comment on his
    approach.)"
