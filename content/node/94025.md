body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have been trying to contact people from fontmarketplace, which
  used to sell fonts on its website, but now is just another shopfront for fonts.com.
  I bought some fonts there in the past, which I want to re-download, but this does
  not work, somehow. I tried to get support, but I have not gotten any reaction. Do
  you know anything about this?\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "Hi Queneau, sorry you've had a problem downloading a font you purchased,
    or getting a timely response from our customer service team. Both are unusual...
    anyway you should be able to sign in to your account and download any items you
    previously purchased (even though we are no longer doing commerce directly from
    FontMarketplace anymore). If you have any questions please feel free to email
    me directly: Bill (at) Fonts.com.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBill Davis"
