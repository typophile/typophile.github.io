body: "When I set type in Akkurat using Indesign, it looks incredibly odd on screen.
  Glyphs \r\nsuch as o, d, e, c, u appear to drop strangely far beneath the baseline,
  and the copy in \r\ngeneral looks quite pixelated and 'bitty'. When I zoom in both
  these effects dissapear. \r\n\r\nWhen I print type below 13 point on a high quality
  inkjet printer, the strange baseline \r\nand bitty appearance are still apparent,
  but significantly less so than on screen. \r\n\r\nIs this the same for other people
  who use Akkurat, or can anyone think of any reason\r\nwhy this would be?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: This is a result of poor [[hinting]]. The font will do fine in offset or laser
    printing, but there's not much you can do about the onscreen appearance short
    of emailing Lineto and urging them to up da hint factor.

    or am I wrong in thinking that?

  body: Hinting can be a tedious process. Perhaps they assume their fonts will most
    likely be used in print.
