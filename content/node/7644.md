  who appreciates nice fonts and decent text layouts.  That&#39;s why so far I&#39;ve
  let other people make fonts and stuck to making the awful text layouts myself. <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;m developing several largish text publications &#40;700 pages each&#41;
  which will be freely distributed over the web in PDF format &#40;and ASCII text,
  and HTML, and...&#41;.  That&#39;s free as in no charge whatsoever. <BR> <BR>I know
  I&#39;m batshit crazy, but I&#39;d prefer to inflict something other than Arial,
  Computer Modern or Comic Sans MS on the reader.  &#40;This is my secret strategem
  to slightly mitigate whatever poor typesetting skills TeX and I share.&#41; But
  that pretty much means embedding fonts, since it&#39;s likely the user won&#39;t
  have whatever odd fonts I happen to pick.  &#40;Well, ya know, Comic Sans is mighty
  tempting... and most people have it...&#41; <BR> <BR>I had the unusual idea of purchasing
  a few relevant fonts instead of, say, downloading them for free from some pirate
  font site or buying one of those three zillion font collection CDs that are mostly
  copies of other people&#39;s fonts.  I&#39;d also love to support one or more of
  the independent fonthouses instead of spending $$$ to make Linotype&#39;s pockets
  even more bloated.  I&#39;ve seen some really beautiful work from independent designers
  in the last couple of weeks.  <BR> <BR>Initial cost isn&#39;t an issue, but the
  licensing is; there&#39;s no way in fraing heck I&#39;m going to pay someone $150
  a year &#40;or the low, low price of just $.10 a download!&#41; for the privilege
  of distributing a free document.  Sorry.  I may be wacky, but not that wacky. <BR>
  <BR>After wasting a lot of time staring at legalese-riddled EULAs and sending a
  few emails, my conclusion was that none of the independents are interested in my
  business.  That&#39;s fine.  I can just as easily give my money to AgfaMonotype/Linotype/Adobe,
  and I did. <BR> <BR>I firmly believe the independents are accomplishing nothing
  more than hurting themselves with these restrictive EULAs.  There are, obviously,
  two classes of font users: legitimate users and pirates.  Honest users are not going
  to waste their time extracting partial fonts with stripped kerning info from PDF
  files, they&#39;ll happily cough up the $$$ for the originals due to honesty and
  appreciation for the effort involved in creating a font.  Unlicensed users won&#39;t
  bother with this either, they&#39;ll either not use a given font or they&#39;ll
  get the original files from someone for free... and yes, I&#39;ve held in my hot
  little hands illegal copies of &#40;for example&#41; all of Emigre&#39;s fonts,
  so you can&#39;t tell me this stuff isn&#39;t happening despite the prohibitions
  on font embedding.  In my view these EULAs are telling potential users &#34;you
  might as well pirate, since you may not be able to use them the way you need anyway&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>&#40;I absolutely do not condone piracy and I don&#39;t own or use any
  pirated fonts or other software.  I&#39;m just trying to point out the realities
  of the situation.&#41; <BR> <BR>The notion of &#34;value add&#34; when it comes
  to distributing embedded fonts in an electronic document goes way over my head.  Electronic
  publishing is no different from paper publishing; while I can imagine a printed
  book that has all the letters in typewriter script and directions to &#34;buy a
  printed copy of something that looks like Bodoni &#40;preferably ITC Bodoni but
  use whatever you can afford&#41;, then cut out the appropriate letters and glue
  them in place&#34;, that seems slightly insane.  I&#39;m looking to buy fonts I
  can use--understand?  Not look at, not install on my computer and then wistfully
  hope someone else has them too, but &#42;use&#42;.  If that means embedding them
  in a freely distributed PDF document, so be it. <BR> <BR>My intent isn&#39;t to
  start a long argument/open another can of worms; the worm cans are wide open and
  it seems they&#39;ve been crawling around loose for a while.  I&#39;m just another
  luser trying to let designers know they&#39;ve lost some business, and why.'

    <BR> <BR>Thanks, everyone. I&#39;ve enjoyed browsing through the site and the
    comments here are greatly appreciated.  I was feeling a tad bit frustrated at
    the time I wrote my rant, but I felt the message needed to be heard.  &#40;Perhaps
    all the legalese was getting to my brain. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41; <BR> <BR>Frustrated, because I was ready to spend
    money on entire font libraries from various publishers, but they couldn&#39;t
    see their way clear to allow use in free publications.  Obviously they have the
    right to make whatever licensing agreements they want--but I still believe they
    will eventually price themselves out of business this way.   <BR> <BR>While I
    love &#34;dead media&#34; &#40;99.9% of the books I read are printed on paper
    and I have a large collection of rare books&#41;, it&#39;s crucial to recognize
    publishing solely in electronic form is a reality... and, with increasing display
    and laser printer resolution, quality fonts are becoming more important than ever.  &#40;Bad
    sales pitches written for free on request. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve read several rants from typophilists
    complaining about the heavy &#40;ab&#41;use of certain ugly free fonts.  I gotta
    wonder if some of these people are the same ones who want to charge for embedding.  Ironic?  Naw...
    <BR> <BR>I certainly didn&#39;t mean to slam Linotype per se--they were just the
    first &#34;big name&#34; that popped into my head.  Dan, I&#39;ve seen <i>many</i>
    admirable Linotype fonts, and I agree they&#39;re a good value; I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll
    end up using several Linotype fonts in my projects.  Maybe they should feel honored
    that I view them as a giant juggernaut crushing the competition in their path...
    <BR> <BR>&#40;The only complaint I have with Linotype&#39;s offerings is a minor
    one--I prefer buying &#34;volume sets&#34; for a family instead of individual
    faces, and frequently I find Linotype doesn&#39;t have a set for the family I&#39;m
    looking at.  I should probably just break down and buy a complete library.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>My main reason for wanting to support some of the newer houses is to
    promote diversity.  For ideological reasons I prefer markets with many participants
    rather than a few big ones, and given a choice of where to spend money I prefer
    to encourage smaller companies.  New entrants seem to be popping up anyway--it&#39;s
    just a personal bent. <BR> <BR>What struck me as a little strange was the uniformity
    of the EULAs in regards to font embedding, at least for the independent houses
    I looked at.  I&#39;d see the same basic wording time and time again, even down
    to the same exact fees.  It really made me wonder if they were honestly thinking
    about these issues, or they were merely going with the crowd.   <BR> <BR>I honestly
    expected to find a few developers explicitly advertising &#34;we allow PDF font
    embedding with no restrictions!&#34;.  No such luck... unless you count places
    such as SSI, of course.  I&#39;m rather curious if most purchasers are aware of
    the embedding restrictions; actually, they probably are and just don&#39;t care.
    <BR> <BR>Tiffany: I&#39;d read your excellent wiki before posting here and I pretty
    much agree with everything there.  While it strongly goes against my grain to
    see extra charges for embedding fonts in commercial contexts, I agree they should
    have the right to do this--and I see this as distinctly different from giving
    away or emailing a PDF document.   <BR> <BR>&#40;I also find the laptop issue
    particularly amusing because I do all my work on one, and I&#39;m sure the server
    installation issues are such a huge pain-in-the-arse in larger groups that people
    do it anyway.&#41; <BR> <BR>Similar issues often come up with &#34;ordinary&#34;
    software, but I feel the situation is a little different with fonts because of
    the large number of them, and the transitory nature and contexts of their use.  While
    some of the EULA restrictions may make sense in isolation, in the grand scheme
    of things these restrictions can become a serious problem, and the usual solution
    is to just ignore the agreement when it becomes too inconvenient. <BR> <BR>The
    whole issue of commercial fonts represents a personal quandary, as I&#39;m a dyed-in-the-wool
    free software supporter and developer. I worked at Cygnus Support for a few years
    and I fully embraced their business model, I use Linux, and it&#39;s 99.9% certain
    anything I produce in the future will be freely available in some form.   <BR>
    <BR>At the same time it doesn&#39;t bother me &#40;much&#41; to pay a reasonable
    fee for use of a font--<i>as long as I can really make use of it</i>.  What&#39;s
    the difference?  There&#39;s no support model for fonts.  When a user obtains
    a font it &#34;just works&#34;, and there&#39;s no way for a developer to make
    an income by providing support services.  &#40;&#34;Pay us to tweak individual
    glyphs for you&#34; just doesn&#39;t sound viable. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41;  <BR> <BR>While people may occasionally request development
    of new fonts, I suspect relying on this income source would severely limit the
    size of the market.'

  body: I agree that Type 1 is relatively obsolete, but it has its good points.  But
    from a software perspective TT/OpenType&#39;s complex format is a pain to work
    with, and most Postscript printers still natively use Type 1 fonts anyway.  <BR>
    <BR>Dan, in the thread you mentioned you were asking why many people still use
    Type 1.  I do because that&#39;s all my software supports, so if I purchased any
    OpenType fonts I&#39;d just have to convert them to their Type 1 equivalents...
    so I might as well just use the Type 1 font from the start.  Another practical
    reason some people still use it is because some printers have support for storing
    font files locally on the printer, and the majority of printers in use still only
    support Type 1.  I&#39;ve also noticed that some OpenType fonts are more expensive
    than their Type 1 equivalents. <BR> <BR>Getting rid of Type 1 fonts won&#39;t
    push people to use OpenType, it&#39;ll just be an inconvenience for those who
    can&#39;t use it.  For example, my X server crashes when I give it OpenType fonts--even
    though they&#39;re supposed to be exactly equivalent to TT.  &#40;It&#39;s obviously
    a bug in the X server, but I don&#39;t feel like spending the time right now to
    track it down or upgrading software.&#41; <BR> <BR>The <i>other</i> reason &#40;let&#39;s
    see if I can get the formatting right <i>this</i> time <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41; people aren&#39;t rushing to switch <i>en masse</i>
    may be because of a perceived lack of benefits.  The only practical advantage
    <i>I</i> see for using OpenType is it mostly solves the glyph mapping issue--and
    for many &#40;most?&#41; people that&#39;s simply a non-issue.  That&#39;s not
    to say it doesn&#39;t have other advantages &#40;it has many&#41;, but it&#39;s
    unlikely most of the software currently in use can take advantage of them. <BR>
    <BR>I also am wary of claims such as &#34;it renders 300% better!&#34;  It <i>may</i>;
    but I think most of us have heard these claims before. I hasten to point out that
    the most common way fonts are used in electronic publications &#40;PDF/Postscript&#41;
    still natively use Type 1 fonts and outlines.  &#40;I also realize some of the
    OpenType benefits such as improved kerning would still apply--assuming the typesetting
    software can make use of it.&#41; <BR> <BR>Hrant, I really appreciate your work
    in releasing a free version of Baskerville... more quality free fonts would be
    a really good thing, helping to save the world from the drugery of Arial Forever.  I
    think it makes a lot of sense to release a free core set and charge for the expert
    characters; it will be interesting to see how that works out... if nothing else,
    that approach should help to discourage pirating. <BR> <BR>Addison, thanks for
    the pointer.  I&#39;m thinking about starting a webpage with links to foundries

  body: 'Eventually there will be an article in the TUG journal treating the process
    fully. I hope to make the article both revealing to non-typophiles and useful
    for geeks like us. It&#39;s even going to have a photo of the largest Baskerville
    glyph in the world&#42;: a &#34;g&#34; from the Monotype cut about three stories
    tall on the side of the Sherman Oaks Galleria. <BR> <BR>&#42; That I know of.
    If you know of a bigger one please send a photo! <BR> <BR>What I can tell you
    right now though is that I spent the first month gathering samples of existing
    Baskervilles &#40;which included the printing of two metal cuts at ArcheType&#41;,
    thinking about what it needs to be &#40;there&#39;s not much room for play in
    the Roman, but my Italic will actually attempt to be more Baskerville than Baskerville&#39;s
    original&#41;, and getting a grasp on the structures of certain tricky characters
    &#40;like reconciling the ugliness of the &#34;a&#34; against historical fidelity&#41;.
    Now all the setup is done and I&#39;ve started rendering out some key glyphs on
    paper. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;ve also sketched out the general design of the specimen,
    which will actually be sort of an homage to JB&#39;s specimen sheet of 1762. I
    will print some with photopolymer letterpress, to accompany sales of the extensions
    &#40;and to send out as shameless plugs&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    than you?

  body: Of course there are. But they cost a lot more &#40;mostly because the &#34;better
    type designer&#34; clause <i>does</i> apply to <i>them</i> quite well&#41;. Most
    notably here they generally cost too much for your typical non-profit organization,
    which is what TUG is. I&#39;m sort of in a special situation where I can make
    fonts at the required level, but paying my bills doesn&#39;t depend on that, so
    I can &#34;speculate&#34; &#40;in this case by hoping for good auxiliary retail
    sales&#41; and lay foundations for my future. But I&#39;m not the only one in
    such a situation. Which is why &#34;being there&#34; is so important. <BR> <BR>hhp
