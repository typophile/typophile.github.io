body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a font which has 'uppercase' and 'lowercase' versions of
  mathematical operators (differentiated by height -- similar to the treatment of
  hyphens, dashes, etc.). I'm trying to figure out how to best handle this in terms
  of OT features, and am debating between two approaches.\r\n\r\n(A) I can treat the
  uppercase variants as basic and access the lowercase ones through some features
  (probably 'onum' and 'smcp').\r\n\r\n(B) I can treat the lowercase variants as basic
  and access the uppercase ones through some features (probably 'case' and 'lnum').\r\n\r\nEither
  way, either '2 + 2 = 4' or 'a + b = c' is going to look weird without some feature
  being applied. I'm wondering which approach is the better option. I'm leaning towards
  (B) simply because many people use the hyphen in lieu of a proper minus symbol and
  (B) would treat the two in a parallel fashion but am still going back and forth
  on the issue.\r\n\r\nNote that this face isn't intended for mathematical use, and
  it contains a set of small figures but no true oldstyle figures. I'd rather leave
  the full-height figures as basic.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: "I think everyone here is correct that this was probably a bad idea. I'd originally
    thought that I should have these simply to parallel the fact that I have raised
    variants of dashes, middots, etc. for all caps settings, but of course equations
    aren't the sort of thing one normally applies all caps formatting to.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: For my typeface, I have variants of the math symbols that are turned on when
    the full-height numerals are turned on. The old style numerals are the height
    of the small caps so, in situations such as x + 8 the difference doesn't seem
    like a problematic issue.

  body: "Actually, the lowercase variants work fine in mixed case situations (using
    case to refer also to full height vs. small figures as well as the more orthodox
    use) such as 3x + 8 = 14. If I went ahead with this using my option B then the
    'uppercase' operators would be used only in situations where all caps formatting
    had been applied such as 'COBRAS+MONGEESE=TROUBLE!' giving the operators a more
    centered appearance, but the lc variants are still perfectly serviceable in situations
    like 2+2=4 (my earlier claim that they looked weird was overstated -- they simply
    aren't visually centered).\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the use for such variants would
    likely arise rather seldomly. On the other hand, the effort involved in implementing
    them is rather minimal (a small handful of slightly raised glyph copies plus one
    line of code).\r\n\r\nSo now I find myself leaning back to including them, though
    I'm still not fully off the fence. All feedback has been appreciated.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Given that hyphens are treated this way, I can't dismiss out of hand the
    idea of doing this with at least the most common mathematical operators in a typeface
    <strong>not</strong> intended for the setting of mathematics.\r\n\r\nGiven that
    in mathematical typesetting, variables are almost always lowercase (and italic)
    and numerals are almost always ranging (as opposed to oldstyle), it is true, as
    has already been noted here, that mathematical operators almost always have to
    be designed to a compromise position that looks good with any mixture of upper-case
    and lower-case.\r\n\r\nObviously, it would <em>not</em> be a good idea to have
    a font switch between oldstyle and ranging numerals depending on whether the letters
    of variables adjacent to them in an equation are uppercase or lowercase. Given
    <em>that</em>, one would almost be constrained to have to have <em>three</em>
    forms of mathematical operators, the compromise kind as well as the uppercase
    form and the lowercase form.\r\n\r\nAnd then you have the problem that if not
    all the operators in a formula are of the same kind, one has their median line
    jumping up and down.\r\n\r\nEven with all these dangers, the alternate forms of
    the operators might be useful where one has only very simple expressions, so the
    rule to encode in the font is perhaps to only use the uppercase form or the lowercase
    form if it is the only form called for in a single expression or even in a whole
    line of text - and otherwise use the compromise form.\r\n\r\nWith such a restriction
    on the use of the alternate forms, while it might be questioned if they're worth
    the bother, if one <em>isn't</em> typesetting mathematics, the majority of the
    time there will usually only be one operator or two used at a time. (And encoding
    such a rule has the bonus that the typeface won't break down if someone <em>does</em>
    use it to typeset mathematics - the dangerous feature just turns off gracefully.)"

  body: I use c2sc for this operation.  I have a normal set that works with mixed
    case and caps and an smcp set that works with smallcaps.  I also have a stylistic
    set which allows the user the choice to use the smallcaps operators with onum
    if they choose. With this setup, I also add smcp figures which are lining but
    at the smallcap height.
