  out any love for Monotype Van Dijck. So, I'd like to know what you guys think. Is
  it irremediably uninteresting or does it just need a little bit of spacing therapy?\r\n\r\n(A
  confession: I've had it for years but have never found the perfect use for it. I
  fear I may be handling it wrong.)"

  body: I've seen van Dijck used in books to good effect, but I think it's too light,
    aside from whatever other technical deficiencies it might have, and it seems to
    me that Monotype had it (or maybe it was just the expert set) bundled with another
    typeface, which would turn off purchasers who just wanted one.

  body: "Like so many fonts from the metal era, when it was released as a Type 1 font
    -- & probably as photocomp font -- no care was taken to get the glyphs to lay
    down ink in offset printing like they did with metal. In other words, it is thin
    & spindly.\r\n\r\nI've used it for display (i.e, in large sizes) when wanting
    an older feel, and using Janson as a text font. And yes, I had to redo the Janson,
    too. Just too much work to also rework Van Dijck.\r\n\r\nI used it for <cite>Inside
    Picture Books</cite> by Ellen Handler Spitz -- see\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=EwWb829rP0IC&dq=inside+picture+books&pg=PP1&ots=mhIELomxsb&sig=iiMdi1fgVyYk5rk_Spbv5w8gDOU&hl=en&prev=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&channel=s&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=hYr&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=Inside+picture+books&spell=1&oi=print&ct=title&cad=one-book-with-thumbnail\r\n\r\nfor
    a sample -- but the sample was scanned from the printed book, & apparently not
    too well. Worse, the NB edition was itself scanned from the original -- we didn't
    set the NB edition. It has to be this way, because we ran out repro for the original
    printing, so there was no PDF file.\r\n\r\nOf course, this many generations downstream,
    the type appears too heavy. \r\n\r\nFWIW"

    word-terminal f I thought it would be an ideal candidate for your contextually
    subbed alternate f with a wider right bearing."

    the font for text (& I hope I don't), I'll take a look at using a terminal f.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you want a 1920s or earlier feel, Van Dijck for display can work."

  body: 'The Frick Collection here in New York uses it for their publications. Works
    there because the paper stock is dull-coated; as another poster notes, its fine
    strokes are too spindly to work reliably on uncoated stock, which leaves out book
    design use under 12 pt. Also, the oldstyle figures are sequestered the old, tedious
    way in an Expert folder, and it also lacks bold and bold italic. I wish somebody
    would re-think it the way Josh Darden re-thought Fournier, which also never had
    bold and bold italic. '

  body: "Yes. Of course, some of us old fogies are glad there are no bold or bold
    italics, since we don't like their use, exp. with classic fonts. If they existed,
    some young whippersnapper designer who doesn't understand the font would specify
    them.\r\n\r\nBTW, one other reason there were no bolds in text fonts was that
    when setting Linotype, a bold usually meant a magazine change, which cost money. "

  body: "Van Dijck was a wonderful metal face. The great thing about it was that it
    was one of the few metal Monotype faces that were made in large composition sizes.
    That meant that one could do an entire oversized limited edition book and have
    the thing composed on the machine, without all that hand setting. Of course, good
    limited edition printers then worked over the lines by hand, adjusting word and
    letter spacing.\r\n\r\nIt sure made gorgeous pages. I did an edition of Robert
    Kelly's long poem \"Mulberry Women\" using machine-set 18-point Van Dijck. The
    type printed beautifully. \r\n\r\nMonotype made some other faces for large composition
    also. Centaur was available maybe up to 20 or 22 point for machine composition.
    I cannot recall which others.\r\n\r\nI will not go near Centaur or van Dijck for
    text setting on the computer. For all the reasons noted above, and more. OK for
    display.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Here's a historical tidbit for you. \r\n\r\nIt is often repeated that Matthew
    Carter is the only living type designer to have worked professionally in every
    type technology -- from punch-cutting to machine-cast to phototype to digital
    (and including wood type now). Well, he never cut an entire font in punches, but
    one of the few punch-cutting projects he did undertake was to cut a set of numerals
    to go with the Monotype Van Dijck. \r\n\r\n-- K."
