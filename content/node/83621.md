  body: "AAfiles is a Caslon, but the body text doesn't look like the same thing.
    Unfortunately, the type in your samples is too small to see the necessary detail.
    Having the page in person would be great, but at screen resolution I can't see
    enough.\r\n\r\nMaybe, if you have those pages, you could try out the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a> to narrow the choices. The main trick to using it is avoid ambiguous
    letter choices. The more of them you make, the less chance you will find the font.\r\n\r\n-

    is Arnhem as well."
