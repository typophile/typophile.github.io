  speaker, and while I usually use point form for my own notes, this question came
  up when my wife was preparing a two minute speech.\r\n\r\nI was surprised not to
  find anything definitive on the web (just \"use a big font\".) \r\n\r\nThe desired
  attributes are easy to read (with or without glasses), easy to find your place if
  you look up, and one that your eye \"flows along.\"\r\n\r\nMy own guess, from my
  limited (and probably dangerous) knowledge of typography would be a fairly uniform
  stroke with small serifs, moderate width, and ???\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    intrinsically legible; rather, it is the reader's familiarity with faces that
    accounts for their legibility... \r\n\r\nof course, there are limits to this,
    but if i were you, i would print out your text in a number of typefaces, sizes
    and line spaces, and see which ones you find the easiest to read in a 'lectern'
    environment\r\n\r\ngeneral rules would be generous line spacing, not more than
    9 words to a line, and clean, open type\r\n\r\ntype that has proved popular when
    i have provided templates for friends who do a lot of public speaking include
    palatino, georgia, frutiger, myriad, officina and minion... \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think the legibility issue is far from decided too. Saying that, one factor
    is certainly line-length, rather than choice of typeface or even size. Taking
    legibility as a factor inherent in a typeface, (certainly some faces are less
    legible if not the other way round) maybe something designed for screen might
    be useful to work out where you are at a glance, even if it looks a bit nasty
    printed. Big bowls, short ascenders/decenders.\r\n\r\nMildly (un)connected, there's
    a story about London Transport testing whether dsetination boards in all caps
    or initial caps were more legible on London buses in motion and at distance. The
    tests were performed in the early 20th century. I think it was entirely inconclusive
    and neither way was more legible than the other. Factors like size and contrast
    were more important. Today London buses use yellow on black with initial caps.
    In Johnston of course. I'm not suggesting this it's good to prepare your speaking
    notes this way though."

    a script. Maybe just note cards. The most important thing is to connect with the
    audience which means eye contact. No?\r\n\r\nI agree with Brett. Especially in
    this instance. You just need something with a large x-height and open shapes."

    a big font\u201D.)\"\r\n\r\nThat is because, in such a case as this, composition
    is the key, here represented by the word 'big font'. That is to say, 1,000's of
    fonts will work just fine... if the one chosen is thoughtfully composed. Details
    of stroke, serif and width are all subject to the composition of good line length,
    leading and, in the case of presentation, bulleting sentences where visual interruption
    of the reading is likely. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    scribbles on scraps of paper.\r\nI find the process of writing aids memory better
    than typography, in forming a gestalt image of the way the thoughts are arranged
    on the page."

  body: "Randy, I agree with all of the above.\r\n\r\nBecause of the reading method,
    I'm not sure that serifs are really that important as long as you choose a typeface
    that distinguishes confusing characters (cap I vs. lowercase l, for example) and
    aids quick recognition of character shapes. Signage fonts (humanist sans are often
    chosen for this purpose) may be a good bet. Web fonts (such as Georgia) might
    work well, as they are designed to be pretty simple and robust for the screen.
    Uniform strokes could be good, but a mono-line might not distinguish characters
    as well as something with a bit of stroke variation.\r\n\r\nBut, as David points
    out, you're spoiled for choice when it comes to fonts. It's the layout that's
    crucial and more specific to the task. The font will fail or succeed because of
    it."
