    I got from the open day but I didn't go. I got in touch with different students
    from WT via email and they told me it wasn't worth visiting the open day. I was
    adviced to take a separate appointement. \r\nI've also had trouble getting in
    touch with WT although I haven't tried to phone them yet (I've been told that
    the staff is only in one day a week, I don't know which day though). I asked a
    series of questions via email to a couple of students and they have answered most
    of my queries. \r\nI guess this doesn't help you much, good luck anyway!"
