  body: "British designer Gareth Hague's Metsys font distributed via t-26, Veer, etc.
    about $150 for 5 weights. I think this has been around for 3-4 years. I think
    this font was based on work done by Gareth Hague's studio Alias for a electronic
    music group called System7 a couple of years prior. \r\nI spent over a year finding
    it back in the day, a purchase worth every penny. "
