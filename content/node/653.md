  one of the other discussions&#41;, I was interested to know what sans serif fonts
  are considered good for laying out masses of text? <BR> <BR>Perhaps something that
  would have complimentary accompanying numerals for laying out the financials of
  an annual report. <BR> <BR>What are the qualities one should look for when identifying
  a suitable sans serif text face? <BR> <BR>Thanks for a great resource :-&#41; '

    in helvetica and you&#39;ll know what I mean&#41;...  <BR>It should contain a

  body: Sorry to veer slightly off-topic here, but I&#39;m <BR>happy to see Brode
    at the forum. I&#39;ve watched the <BR>Sacred Nipple for some time and it&#39;s
    nice to have <BR>another experienced fontographer on board. <BR> <BR>Welcome,
    Brode. <A HREF="http://www.t26font.com/fonts/fontshow/db.cgi?db=default&amp;uid=default&amp;ID=900&amp;ww=on&amp;view_records=View%2BRecords%2CShoe"
    TARGET="_blank">Shoe Repairs</A> is a wonderful thing  <BR>and your <A HREF="http://www.sacrednipple.co.za/new.html"
    TARGET="_blank">newer stuff</A> shows some great potential. <BR>&#40;What&#39;s
    the &#34;FRESH&#34; font on that page, btw?&#41; <BR> <BR>Stephen

  body: Geez ...thanks! Although &#39;experienced&#39; is hardly a word I&#39;d use
    to describe myself. Infact if people ask me if I&#39;m a typographer I say &#39;no,
    just a designer who really loves type&#39;.  <BR> <BR>The hardest thing for me
    creating type in South Africa is that there is absolutely no one there who I know
    of that has an expansive knowledge of typography and fontographer. So I&#39;ve
    pretty much been working in a vacuum. That&#39;s why this Typophile forum is definately
    the best thing I&#39;ve come across on the net...ever! Props to those concerned...I
    cling to your every word. <BR> <BR>Oh, the &#34;FRESH&#34; font is basically &#39;Retoric&#39;,
    designed by Darren Scott and released by <A HREF="http://www.t26.com/changeyourface.htm"
    TARGET="_blank">&#91;T.26&#93;</A>, that i&#39;ve just given a stencil effect
    to and tweaked around a bit.

  body: I like FB Scala Sans&#42; best, with its complete family of weights, lining
    and old-style figures, <BR>and true italics. <BR> <BR>AGFA&#39;s new recutting
    of Syntax&#42; looks <BR>promising as well, but I haven&#39;t had <BR>a chance
    to try it yet. <BR> <BR>Akzidenz Grotesk&#42;, Avenir, Bureau Gothic, <BR>Formata&#42;,
    Franklin Gothic, Gill Sans, Kabel, <BR>ITC Legacy Sans&#42;, News Gothic, Officina
    Sans&#42;, <BR>Trade Gothic, Emigre&#39;s Triplex&#42; and even <BR>Frutiger,
    Helvetica, Myriad and Univers <BR>make my list on occasion. <BR> <BR>Also, by
    all means look into Storm Type Foundry&#39;s <BR>John Sans&#42;, a sanserif based
    on Baskerville. <BR> <BR>Also, the Dutch Type Library offers several that <BR>come
    highly recommended, including DTL Argo&#42;, <BR>DTL Caspari&#42;, DTL Documenta
    Sans&#42;, <BR>DTL Haarlemmer Sans&#42; and DTL Nobel. <BR>I haven&#39;t yet been
    able to get licenses <BR>for any of the DTL faces, but I plan to start <BR>investing
    in them as soon as I can. <BR>Their reputation is excellent. <BR> <BR>I have to
    admit that I&#39;m intrigued by AGFA&#39;s <BR>new recutting of Futura&#42; as
    well, with its <BR>full family and the recent addition of <BR>old-style numerals.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t care much for ITC Stone Sans&#42; myself, <BR>but a friend
    of mine swears by it. <BR> <BR>Most of the fonts can be found &#40;or linked to&#41;
    <BR>at MyFonts.com. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.myfonts.com</A>
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left a lot out, but this list <BR>offers a good
    starting point. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42; Indicates fonts that I know offer old-style
    figures <BR> <BR>David
