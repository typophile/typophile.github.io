  body: It's ITC Bookman Swash, probably <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_bookman_swash_medium/&s=c">medium
    weight</a>. I'm not 100% sure if all these glyphs are available in digital format.

  body: "I think this is the [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000085|Jukebox
    Bookman]] version by Jason Walcott. Look at the character maps for the swash versions,
    and I think you will find all of these glyphs.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
