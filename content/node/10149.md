  body: Way to go, Cheshire, you da man! I&#39;m impressed every time you come up
    with these obscure internet-only freeware fonts. Jolly good job!

  body: 'Yves, as obscure fonts go, this one sticks out because it&#39;s a font that
    was created from the old NASA logo. <BR> <BR>I seem to recall that someone before
    Ray Larabie designed a pre-digital version of this font, because I think it was
    once available at least as rub-down type. &#40;Maybe RL did the pre-digital version,
    too, though if Letraset had released it I don&#39;t think it would have been called
    Nasalization in the original.&#41; <BR> <BR>As a kid, I probably drew my own version
    of other letters in that same style. In fact, now that I think of it, Omni magazine
    used a very similar face, maybe even a modification of the same, for its banner,
    and that was waaaay before the Larabie Era: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/6914.jpg"

  body: Well, of course. It&#39;s called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/space/">Space</a>.
    Duh. <BR> <BR>Even so, the Omni logo was adapted from it. <BR> <BR>However, with
    the M the way it is in Fernando&#39;s specimen, the original id of Nasalization
    is still correct.

  body: Oh! NASA. I get it. I always pronounced it <i>nasal-ization</i>. <BR>Wondered
    what the shnoz reference was.

  body: I&#39;m sure Mr. Larabie wanted you to think so, too. Another in a long line
    of terrible puns filling in as names for fonts derived from famous inspirations.
    As a dedicated punster myself, I can only apologize for the punning community
    for such inflictions of pain. We&#39;re not very good at self-policing.
