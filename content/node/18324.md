  body: "Wow, Cerilene, you're coming up with some good ones. If I had collected this
    I think it would be in <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg1.html\">Part
    6 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> (Sign lettering scripts).\r\n\r\nIt reminds
    me of a few things, but they have the two-storey 'a' (Birdlegs, Havergal and Tweed,
    to mention three). The 'a' is more like 'Squire', but there are too many other
    differences. Sassoon is also a bit similar (sorry for not putting in links --
    these are all available from large vendors).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, I know, I'm annoying, huh :D\r\n\r\nThese were all fonts I've had for
    awhile, and haven't been able to identify... When I found another font I had been
    looking for *forever* identified on here, I knew this was the board I had to join!
    ;)\r\n\r\nI'm just so glad you were able to identify that one... This one is probably
    another that is not being distributed.. The only place I've ever seen it is inside
    the Rachael Ray magazine, and it's used a lot, so it's probably just theirs! :-\\\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for all your help :)\r\nCerilene :)"

  body: "The font is called Everyday and it comes in bold and regular varieties. As
    you guessed earlier, it's a custom font for the Everyday Rachael Ray magazine.
    In fact, the \"Everyday\" part of the masthead that you see on the cover is in
    fact EveryDay Bold.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. \r\n\r\n"

    be purchased anywhere?? How sad for me! :-\\\r\n\r\nThank you again for your response
