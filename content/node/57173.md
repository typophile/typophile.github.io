  Cochin, but less quirky. I've been looking for a very long time ... I need it for
  a subordinate role (textish), and it should not call attention to itself.\r\n\r\n(Also
  looking for a sans serif font of the same description.)"

    wonderful) Centaur you could try a solid Venetian Renaissance Antiqua like Adobe
    Jenson Pro. Plus, it offers optical weights.\r\n\r\nA humanist sans with a low
    x-height is FF Seria Sans for example."

  body: "Thank you poms, but Adobe Jenson Pro looks (to my eye) almost the same as
    Centaur \u2013 only not as good! I'm looking for something really, really plain,
    that's the problem. I mentioned Centaur and Cochin only to show the x-height I'm
    looking for. I'm calling the lower case e's in Centaur \"quirky.\" That's what
    I don't want. I really appreciate your reply though. Great web site!!"

  body: Futura has a surprisingly low x-height and proportions that would match what
    you're looking for. It's also so common that it won't draw attention to itself
    easily.

    Atma]] and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_seria/|FF Seria]]
    both have relatively small x-heights. Not sure if they qualify as plain for you.
    \r\n\r\nMy own [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman|Whitman]] is considered
    pretty plain and has modest x-height, but not as relatively small as Centaur or
    Cochin."

  body: Just to play devil's advocate, I'd argue that a small x-height doesn't make
    a font unobtrusive. Both the caps and the letters with ascenders (& by parity,
    descenders) are a lot higher; this "unevenness" calls attention to itself. You
    might be better served with a font with a reasonably large x-height set in a smaller
    size.
