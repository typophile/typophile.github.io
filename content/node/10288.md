body: Hi, I&#39;m seeking some font choice advice. My toy piano band Twink &#40;<a
  href="http://www.twink.net" target="_blank">http://www.twink.net</a>&#41; is releasing
  a &#34;metal&#34; EP, and I designed a special logo for the package. I&#39;m wondering
  what typeface&#40;s&#41; might compliment the logo, for use in the album title &#40;&#34;Welcome
  to the Jingle&#34;&#41;. Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6964.gif"

  body: Maybe some script, but in graffiti way, because of the title? <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?1S6"
    target="_blank"> Spill Milk</a>, or <a href="http://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5035"
    target="_blank"> Wordy</a>? Or maybe more <a href="http://www.eknp.com/php/fd.php?f=luxembourg"
    target="_blank"> metal</a> type? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions! I like the sketchy script idea, I may go with
    <a href="http://www.fontalicious.com/super/thug.html">Thug</a>. It&#39;s simultaneously
    whimsical and tough, and seems to be a good foil to a sculpted logo. &#40;Track
    list will go below the title, possible in Bureau Grotesque. Bunny skull will be
    front cover, text on back.&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7001.gif"

  body: Oh yeah, Blambot and PIzzadude both have stuff that fits the bill. Now I&#39;m
    considering using <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/blambot/humbucker/">Humbucker</a>
    or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/tagboyhardcore/">TagBoy Hardcore</a>.  <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for the bunny illo feedback too! Whenever the disc is done, I&#39;ll
    probably sell shirts. Keep checkin&#39; <a href="http://twink.net">the Twink site</a>
    for news, but it&#39;ll be several months at least. <BR> <BR>PS - here&#39;s the
    illo for the liner notes, heh heh... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7011.gif"
