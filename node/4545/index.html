		<div class="commentbody">Geoff: <BR> <BR>This is the first time in a while that I think Avant Garde is an appropriate choice for logotype. As you indicated in your original post, this is a work-in-progress, and as the rest of the posts indicate, you still have a lot of work to do. <BR> <BR>I like Avant Garde because it is a clean typeface which is appropriate for the golfing community. I also like the implications of balls (we all know what I mean here) created by the circular letterforms. I would suggest exploring more subtle approaches to manipulating the type than what you have done, thus far. <BR> <BR>The &quot;W&quot; with the &quot;R-ball&quot; implies a bouncing ball, which I don't think is the most beautiful shot to highlight. If I was showcasing a shot I think it would either be a long drive, or a perfect putt. The drive would require an arc and the putt would require a hole. I don't know if either of these would work into this logo, but you might sketch out a few ideas. <BR> <BR>The &quot;L-club&quot; looks much more like a hockey stick to me. That starts alluding to Happy Gilmore, which albeit is a classic in my eyes, but I don't know how the more serious golfing community views that one. <BR> <BR>Probably the most simple solution is to put some dimples in the &quot;O&quot; and call it good, but my guess is that the &quot;O&quot; in golf has been used as a golf ball hundreds of times over (but I can't support that with any research at this time). As I mentioned above, I like the concept of implied balls and subtle letterform manipulation. <BR> <BR>Good luck! I'm anxious to see what you come up with. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although I do perhaps think that what you've posted needs a lot of work, and I also agree that the {R) shouldn't be the center of attention, I'm not so sure I agree that the clients who might use this type of service won't be looking for something fresh, young, hot, youthful, vigorous, etc. Golf is a sport for the rich, but so are skiing and snowboarding. So who's to say that it has to be upscale and stiff, IMO, this is incorrect. I'm not saying total street is appropriate, but think about P. Diddy. He golfs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">G'day again, <BR> <BR>I've come up with a few ideas, the deadline is quickly nearing, I wish I had more time on this! <BR> <BR>Again my again is not to do a typical solution ie, golfball as the O in golf. I want to find an unique, original solution to this problem. <BR> <BR>Hmm, although Golf is considered an upscale sport,  alot of people dont consider it upscale. I agree, my first idea was too &quot;Street&quot;. What I am trying here is to design something modern and upscale but friendly. <BR> <BR>I know I am posting ideas that are radically different to one other. The one I like at the moment is the circular/geometric &quot;golfweb&quot; logotype (3rd on the top right). I feel the geometric circluar shape reminds me of golfballs. What do you think? <BR> <BR>Keywords for this project for me are golf, web design and cocnnection/interation. As Golfweb is essentially a web design company for golf clubs. <BR> <BR>Thank you for the honest critque. <BR> <BR>Cheers. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34920.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chase, now you're just showing off (it takes one to know one :-). Geoff, translation: lachrymal = teardrop-shaped. Pretty rare term. Although useful. But even though I agree with Chase that an ear (what the structure in question is normally called) would help make it more of a &quot;g&quot;, of course it doesn't have to be lachrymal, and (as Chase says) it probably shouldn't be. And virtually all binocular &quot;g&quot;s in <i>any</i> font (not just serif) have an ear. The classical exception is Centaur's Italic (dubbed &quot;Arrighi&quot;). <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Chase, I like that teddy-bear &quot;g&quot;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Geoff, to be honest, I didn't really care for the capital G I did either. This last iteration is nice and simple, but I feel that with a simple marque like that you need stronger type. I concur with your use of a sans face, but if you're straddling the upscale/classy set as well as the contemporary and tech-savvy, you may need something with a bit more presence.  <BR> <BR>I think something simple like Univers Extra Condensed might work, IMO a face with non-circular bowls would complement a circular marque nicely. <BR> <BR>Hrant: Sorry, sometimes I don't know my tail from my ear <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I like the teddy-bear too</div>

This way I dont necessarily have to include the marque every time the logotype is displayed. This is crucial for the designs I have in mind for the business card, letterhead and envelope. <BR> <BR>Personally, I like number 4 with the avant garde typeface I think I prefer a circluar typeface as it complements the marque. I still like number 1 (despite not using the  marque as &quot;o&quot; in &quot;golfweb&quot; it will be way too busy!) <BR> <BR>Any comments or critques would be appreciated! <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.</div>

Using both the mark and logotype together is too much of a good thing (think white chocolate, milk chocolate, semi-sweet and dark all at once!!) It is a strength that you will be able to use them separately and interchangeably, but never together.</div>

This is a first crack at a sketch I liked. Well, I like to do things simple, but in an original manner. I dont want to copy an over-used sucessful layout or anything. So one of my aims here is to create an unique and creative layout with functionality and (this is going to be difficult!) legibility. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35551.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>The letter body text is 10point on I believe 13point Avant Garde Book.

I wanted to enclose the address and contact details into goftball shape, I think this could work. <BR> <BR>Honest crituque would be fantanstic. Thank you.</div>

You've got a strong mark and I agree with Darrel, that this new element is detracting from it. <BR> <BR>A couple of random thoughts if you do want to try to make it work: <BR> <BR>1 Your idea might work OK on the bizcard if you completed the silhouette of the tee to bleed off of the bottom of the card. This gives it some purpose (clarifying the tee of the mark) vs. just repeating the existing mark in a weaker fashion. If you did this, you might also try typing golfweb really small and repeating it across the bottom edge of the card so that it is like grass. Also, centering it isn't very interesting. <BR> <BR>2 Maybe you can type golfweb really small and repeat it so that it floods the card (grass), except for a round circle that represents a golf ball. You can even make the type get a little larger from top to bottom representing perspective. <BR> <BR>&hellip;just brainstorming thoughts. <BR> <BR>Aloha!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Geoff, I agree with scott and darrel on your latest version. <BR> <BR>Adding the repeated graphic dilutes the punch of the first. Not only that, but it changes my perception, and now they seem to be dialogue bubbles from a comic strip. <BR> <BR>By the way, I am very impressed with your direction and development.

		<div class="commentbody">I like it! <BR> <BR>To be super nitpicky: <BR> <BR> - does your client have green toner in their printers?  <BR> <BR> - I'm a fan of one-sided business cards for usability's sake. I'd suggest moving the logotype 'golfweb' to the info side of the card (leave the icon on the back). And then do *not* use the same typeface for the person's name. Even with the two-side approach, I think using the type for the name dilutes the ID system too much. <BR> <BR>- while not as critical as the b-card, I might swap sides on the envolope. <BR> <BR>The golfball looks great. Overall, this is reallly nice. Great job.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Darrel, I'm not sure what you mean by the &quot;green toner&quot;, but my client is getting this package printed in pantone 365 (if i remember correctly). <BR> <BR>Hmm, I think that is a good suggestion about the business card. <BR> <BR>I think it will be difficult to pick a different typeface that would go nicely with avant garde? I am really really new to typography. Any ideas?  <BR> <BR>It is early in the morning. Tired, the only thing I can think of at the moment is a nice monoweight old style or a stab serif, so it would contrast the sans serif so they go together with more harmony then a transitional/modern. <BR> <BR>Cheers.</div>
