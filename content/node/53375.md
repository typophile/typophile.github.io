    is out of print, but I think Hyphen Press was going to make a second edition.\r\nI
    hope, since I don't have a copy :-("

  body: "Depends on if you want to design typefaces by yourself or just design _with_
    typefaces.\r\n\r\nHave look at:\r\nDesigning Type by Karen Cheng\r\nIn the typography
    class here in Basel we call her book \xABAnatomie der Buchstaben\xBB the \xABBible\xBB.
    ;) I just don't know if Designing Type is the English version of it.\r\n\r\nAlso
    great books, which I didn't find in English editions, are:\r\n\r\nDetailtypografie
    by Rald de Jong\r\nLesetypografie by Friedrich Forssman and Hans Peter Willberg\r\n\r\nBasic
    Knowledge about the use of typography:\r\nTypography by Emil Ruder\r\n\r\nGreat
    typographic design books are:\r\nType One by Robert Klanten, Michael Mischler
    and Silja Bilz\r\nFresh Type by Andres Janser and Christina Reble"

    \"Anatomy of a Typeface\", which is a different book.\r\nI'm in the type design
    class in Z\xFCrich, and some of us have the Cheng book in German, some in English,
    and it looks like it's pretty much exactly the same."

  body: "And if you are looking for the very best book about the history of typography,
    I would suggest you to learn french and buy \"Histoire de l'ecriture typographique\"
    by Yves Perrousseaux. There is simply no english equivalent, and I sincerely pity
    the non-french speaking for not be able to have access to this wonderful, definitive
    book. Oh please make an english version.\r\n\r\ndr"
