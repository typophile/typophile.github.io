  adding Typophile to my resume' as one of my design memberships. I figure the amount
  of knowledge I've accumulated over the years posting on Typophile would qualify
  this.\r\n\r\nHow do the rest of you feel about that? Is that a bit much? Would this
  be noticed/respected by potential employers (I'm betting yes myself)?"

    and for a design job do you really want to work for a company that doesn't know
    what typophile is? I say include it, when they google you they'll get typophile
    as the top hits so you may as well put it on there - you've got nothing to hide,
    right?

    the hits are from Typophile.\r\n\r\nI guess I really posted the question to see
    what kinda of \"official accreditation\" Typophile holds within the design community.
    I've always viewed it to be more than just a forum, and I wanted to see if maybe
    there was a future similar to NAPP or AIGA."

    organizations on business cards or a resume. Unlike architectural, industrial,
    and interior design associations, most graphic design organizations aren\u2019t
    accrediting organizations, there are no qualifications to join them, they don\u2019t
    regulate anything or intercede in matters on behalf of designers and clients,
    and in the case of NAPP, it\u2019s really just an overpriced magazine subscription.
    Unless you\u2019re just sucking up to someone who is a very active member of an
    organization and unlikely to hire nonmembers, it\u2019s just window dressing.\r\n\r\nAnd
    as for Typophile, the last time I was helping someone review resumes, people who
    added stuff like blogging and web forum activity to their resumes went right into
    the trash. Who wants to hire someone who spends so much time on web forums that
    he puts it on a resume?"

    my experience is still in it's infantry. I see listing memberships to these active
    design communities as a viable extension of my design education. I've been part
    of several conferences hosted by NAPP and AIGA. I've learned a lot of helpful
    tips and expanded my design skills (albeit for specific programs) at these conferences
    too. Granted they're not nearly as ingrained into the community as other associations
    are with other professions. You have to agree they're recognized by most in the
    design community."

    A Typophile mention may produce a comprehending nod, but you'll always have greater
    success if you present yourself to prospective employers as somebody they <i>want</i>
    to hire rather than as somebody they <i>should</i>.

    trying to find out if Typophile is or could be considered a valued design association

    might be a difficult thing to measure in the world of graphic design. So little
    differentiates us from the wide gamut that makes up the creative art world. Examinations
    would have to be very specific, and geared towards both knowledge and application.
    There would be so many fields of accreditation. Would you be expected to take
    several accreditations if you're an illustrator, web designer, typographer and
    production artist?"
