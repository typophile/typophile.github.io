body: "Hi everyone,\r\nCan anyone tell me about Lubalin Graph? Im finding it quite
  difficult to get actual history about it. I know its mum is avant garde and its
  basically just avant garde with slab serifs jammed on but all the history I've found
  goes along the lines of....\"and then came Lubalin Graph, a slab serif form of avant
  garde...\" and thats it. Anyone know WHY it was designed? Any info would be much
  appreciated"
