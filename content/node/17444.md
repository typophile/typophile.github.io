  body: "Here's the full text, for when the link stops working. (They always do.)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI
    am a design professor at a state university that is unable to adequately fund
    our graphics program and thus to provide the fonts we need to teach typography.
    My colleagues and I have stocked the lab computers with fonts we purchased as
    professional designers, fonts licensed only for our use on a single computer,
    not multiple machines in a classroom. Are our actions justifiable in the name
    of education? \r\n   - Anonymous, Connecticut \r\n    \r\n   Your motives are
    good; your methods are not. It is regrettable that this important resource is
    so expensive, but that does not justify the conduct you describe. \r\n   There
    are alternatives that might help you get the fonts you need. As I'm sure you know,
    much software is available at a more modest educational rate or even as shareware.
    Some schools impose a small materials charge on students in lab classes. What's
    more, there is much debate about what is permissible as fair use. It is doubtful
    that this doctrine allows installing multiple copies of an entire font, but that
    is something for an intellectual property lawyer to sort out. Unfortunately, if
    these options prove useless, you are still ethically barred from semi-swiping
    these fonts. \r\n    Update: The design professor tried each of these strategies,
    with no success. He plans to delete all but legitimately licensed fonts and hopes
    that students seize the opportunity to be creative. \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI
    take umbrage at this part of Mr Cohen's reply: \"...but that is something for
    an intellectual property lawyer to sort out.\"\r\n\r\nActually, it's something
    for the professor, the students, and the foundries to sort out. But Mr Cohen was
    correct when he said that \"much software is available at a more modest educational
    rate or even as shareware.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor X in CT, and any other prof in the
    same situation should contact the foundries whose work c/he finds interesting
    and potentially useful to her/his students; some will donate fonts, or offer discounts
    on multiple-use for educational purposes. We need to instill in students a respect
    for type, and teach then that possession is NOT 9/10ths of the law when it comes
    to software."

    for students?\r\n\r\n<em>On a similar note.</em> Can fonts be generated to only
    work on the machine's on which they were installed? Is something like that possible? "

    Really, really great! I don't think it is possible yet, though.\r\n\r\nSeveral
    foundries do have students discounts available, including at least Adobe (they
    have at least one package available at a student price), T-26, and Linotype. I
    think that student pricing is a good idea, and all the other software I used as
    a student was available at discounted rates."

    This wouldn't be very useful to most users - fonts are not music files. You need
    to embed them in PDF's and send them to output devices for them to be useful. "

  body: "Fair enough. I suppose I'm thinking of a specific setup where the students
    can print from the design lab directly to the printers in the building or the
    print room on campus. They can also log on to the font server from their student
    housing. With this type of controlled environment, couldn't there be some way
    to control the font usage? \r\n\r\nBut, my question is really about finding a
    way to guarantee the fonts won't go with the students. However, I know there are
    no guarantees."

  body: "Tiffany, since you ask...\r\n\r\nI don't like to publicise the exact terms
    of Thirstype's & Village's student licensing, but it is quite favourable to the
    student. We mostly ask that students respect the type, don't share it with their
    colleagues, and a few other stipulations, all pretty easy to meet. (The other
    foundries distributed by Village have their own feelings about this; I only speak
    for the two foundries I can speak for.)\r\n\r\nAs for strip-searching students...
    oldnick, you are a dirty old man ;-) Don't forget to look on their iPods and Flashdrives
    too... There really is no way to guarantee that students won't steal typefaces
    and other software. In my mind, the most important thing is that they legally
    license the typefaces once they use them out in the real world.\r\n\r\nThere have
    been efforts made in the past to protect font files from piracy, none of which
    has really been successful. The one which comes to mind is the hidden Mac OS 9
    extensions which \"enabled\" a generation of Hoefler Type Foundry (before Mr Frere-Jones'
    arrival) types. It was impossible to send files to service bureaux, as they also
    needed the hidden extension. And this was in the says before PDF print workflows,
    when 99% of design layout was RIPped from QuarkXPress. HTF released updated and
    unprotected files to their clients to replace the protected files.\r\n\r\nI would
    be very curious to hear the story from Mr Hoefler directly; I think that it was
    an important and useful experiment, and many of of were watching with great interest."

  body: "Here\u2019s my idea\u2026 \r\n\r\nRealizing that design students are the
    future customers of their work a consortium of leading, respected font makers
    has put together the \u201CEducational Font Program\u201D font rental service
    for college design departments worldwide. For a low annual fee subscribers get
    access to hundreds of high quality fonts for student and faculty use. A tiered
    program to fit any budget, fonts are provided in managed sets, including \u201Cclassic
    text faces\u201D, \u201CBest of the Bauhaus\u201D, and the ever popular \u201CTypophile
    Picks of 2003\u201D. \r\n\r\nEach font set includes best sellers from foundries
    like X, Y and Z. These are the full complete retail OpenType versions of the fonts
    in question, the only difference being that they include a unique serial number
    encoded within each font file and font name linking the font to an educational
    establishment. For example \u201CGill Sans\u201D would become \u201CGill Sans
    Ed4567\u201D,  where 4567 is a unique identifier associated with the school. \r\n\r\nThe
    fonts are managed by a custom version of \u201CN\u201D, the leading font management
    utility. The utility includes advanced font auditing technology to help ensure
    that all fonts installed on the school\u2019s workstations are legally licensed.
    Using the tool administrators set parameters to allow or restrict additional font
    installation or purge unlicensed fonts. \r\n\r\nIn addition subscribers also receive
    access to printed and online material describing the art and science of font design
    and development, and for a small additional fee a real living breathing type designer
    will visit the school and give a lively presentation on type design to the staff
    and students.   \r\n"

  body: Si, I like it. But depending upon a font management app is not that convincing
    to me. (I use Font Book.) That being said, just as there are educational versions
    of software which clearly state this in the splash screen, I think that "Edu"
    versions of fonts - with or without the serial number - are a very good idea.
    As are the ideas for resources, type designer visits, etc.

  body: "I really like this idea as well.\r\n\r\nMost school's do use a licensed font
    management app, so the key would be to have the management app as part of the
    deal. Less hassle for them. The instructions for use are included. More and more
    school's require laptops, why not also include fonts?\r\n\r\nMost school's --
    and I'm basing this off of my past experience -- by now have an IT team in place.
    Any computer on campus has the same software. The labs are specific for their
    use. Obviously the average engineering program is different than the industrial
    design, for instance. I would guess that the IT department at most school's is
    site wide. Random thinking, but anything organized, packaged and designed to assist
    people would be an added bonus. I'd guess if the numbers were right and the correct
    people approached this could be a wonderful thing. "
