  body: A nice idea, but why is this bible page suffering from No-Hyphenation? Gutenberg
    got it right -- a narrow column justifies correct hyphenation.

  body: "I tried it with hyphenation first.  It would have been more efficient per
    line and required a larger type to end on the same word as Gutenberg's, and I
    didn't like it as much at that larger size.  If I had had access to the full text
    of it as-hyphenated, I probably would have tried harder to make that work, but
    as I said, I was actually quite surprised and disappointed to find out that one
    of the most famous books ever written doesn't have a text-only version anywhere
    I could find.  I can find the Vulgate generally, but not the Gutenberg text as-written
    and as-hyphenated.  Transcribing it myself wasn't an option, as my Latin isn't
    strong enough (understatement), nor my ability to parse some of the more peculiar
    features of 15th century blackletter, particularly abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI certainly
    wasn't trying to correct (or even improve!) on Gutenberg.  I merely wanted to
    turn it into a historically anachronistic version.\r\n\r\nI was more happy with
    the Vogue Paris cover, but it risks seeming political, which wasn't my intent."

  body: "Hrant, that's explained in the full blog post.\r\n\r\nI must admit it's ...
    unsettling, perhaps ... to see iconic, or at least immediately recognizable, text
    in what \"obviously\" is the wrong font. Perhaps it's only \"obviously wrong\"
    because this does not concern <em>just</em> the font, but the image-as-a-whole.\r\n\r\nImagine
    the Vogue cover, for example, not in full color but in black-and-white. (And also
    slightly different make up & hair-do for the lady.) That will make it look like
    a period cover -- and we all know what period I mean as well. But instead we see
    it in a clearly <em>modern</em> context, with bar code and all."

    body: "Origin of the Species was 1859, Akzidenz-Grotesk was 1896, and Helvetica
      was 1957.\r\n\r\nThere were definitely similar grotesques Origin could have
      been printed in (or more likely, titled in), but given most designers' familiarity
      with Helvetica's notable peculiarities, as well as other fans of typography,
      most of the then-existing sans types would appear slightly different to us."

    to the Future</em> or <em>Cowboys and Aliens</em>\u2014the end result is more
    likely to be amusement rather than enlightenment. Which is fine: there's probably
    a bigger audience for Harlequin Romances than for, say, novels by William Faulkner."

  body: "Of course. All present-day versions of 1850s types are changed from their
    originals.\r\nThat\u2019s why I put quote marks around my font attribution.\r\nBut
    within the context of all the other reworkings, the Darwin exercise is quite different,
    involving no anachronism in type style, only the means of reproduction.\r\nThe
    typeface of the reset Darwin title page would not have looked alien in 1859, other
    than by deviating from the convention that such types would not be used for title
    pages, only in ads such as <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/49539664621259744/\">this</a>.\r\n"

  body: That's a fantastic advertisement, it captures typographic conventions I rarely
    saw "in the wild" in contemporary work until the style started re-appearing in
    retro re-creations in the last decade or so.
