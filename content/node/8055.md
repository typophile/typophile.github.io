body: Hi <BR> <BR>My path through the world of type design has strayed into researching
  the private press movement of  19th and 20th century England, and this has led to
  me starting a typeface which is influenced by a lost typeface from this era. <BR>
  <BR>The new typeface has become something quite different from the original, so
  I wouldn&#39;t really call it a revival, but it made me think about the way that
  a type designer should credit this kind of inspiration. <BR> <BR>I know that revivals
  themselves can be a hot topic, with one designer emailing me and suggesting that
  I should associate myself with anyone who makes revivals, so maybe there is a wider
  topic here aswell? <BR> <BR>Your thoughts? <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>===

  body: Jim, practically speaking, in terms of &#34;proper&#34; crediting, I think
    if you were to write anything longer than a paragraph about the type in question
    you should passingly mention your erstwhile source as &#34;inspiration&#34;. If
    you write a full article about it, you might spend like half a page on it. But
    it would help to see the original and yours. <BR> <BR>&#62; we don

  body: '&#62;&#62;how common is direct to plate printing? For what kinds of printing?&#62;&#62;
    <BR> <BR>Almost all our work is for University Presses, which usually means short-run
    printing -- 1000 to 3000 copies is the typical print run. I&#39;d say that about
    half the books we set are printed direct to plate -- some shops don&#39;t use
    CTP at all, some use it for web presses but not sheet-fed presses, and some use
    it for everything. But you know that as the number of people in the stripping
    room falls, sooner or later, stripping up flats will be a thing of the past. <BR>
    <BR>Another factor -- I&#39;d say 75% of the books we do have at least some halftones.
    We always place &#34;live art&#34; in the PDF. That means that even if the printer
    is running out a negative from the PDF &#40;instead of making the plate directly&#41;,
    they still can&#39;t play any tricks to fattten up the type, because the dotgain
    in the halftones would be too great. <BR> <BR>All this stuff is ripped at 2400
    dpi or more for either negative or plate; another reason type gets thin. <BR>
    <BR>Best I can do to answer your question.'

  body: It is great to have someone with your expertise on contemporary printing here
    on Typophile. Are you saying that CPT printing inherently thins type, or just
    that the printer can&#39;t do tricks to thicken some type that was too spindly
    before? <BR> <BR>My immediate interest in this is because I will have to choose
    before too long between Jenson Light and Regular for a book. Actually, I will
    have to make the case to the publisher. I will talk to the printer, but the more
    I understand of this the better. I suspect the right decision will depend on paper
    &#40;coated or not&#41; as well as print process. I know what it looks like on
    screen and laser printer, but I fear that this may be a bad guide. What should
    I be asking?

  body: Both CTP and film-to-plate are noticeably though subtly lighter than your
    laser output. If you&#39;re currently torn between Light and Regular in looking
    at laser proofs, go for regular because it will come out lighter on press than
    it does from your laser printer. <BR> <BR>T
