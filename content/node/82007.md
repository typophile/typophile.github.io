body: "\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI have only started reading posts on this forum today, so apologies
  for any faux pas I may commit. \r\n\r\nI am considering using Optima as the typeface
  for an organic cosmetic company. The basic attributes I am after are: Beauty, Nature,
  Friendliness, Elegance. In a nut shell I am after \"natural beauty\".\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think about using Optima as the typeface for this logo? Also, are you even
  permitted to use Optima for logos using a regular license. \r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Optima is an elegant and sophisticated typeface, and that's something so
    universally agreed upon that it virtually became the Helvetica of cosmetics. Optima
    has been the go-to typeface for the cosmetics industry for decades; so much so
    that major brands that used it have recently been moving away from it. \r\n\r\nIt's
    not a bad choice but it's not something that's going to differentiate your product
    in the marketplace."

    non-organic.\r\nBody Shop uses a plain old sans."

  body: I think Nick's advice is very important here. A similar font to Optima could
    be as well [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typofonderie/angie-sans/|Angie Sans]]
    by Porchez (who designed the typeface for Le Monde and the Sabon Next revival),
    but then after all it is maybe too similar again. Just keep that in mind what
    Nick said.

  body: "Thank you for all your comments and suggestions. Choosing the write type
    seems a delicate balancing act as some of your chooses(in my opinion)lean towards
    elegance and others towards organic/friendliness. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions on what
    weight I should use: regular/bold/thin? It has to be legible on product packaging. "
