    number of bugs that never get fixed) is you can't nest character styles. How's
    he do that? "

    something nearing nested <em>character</em> styles is by using a Nested Style
    or a GREP Style to force a 'step 1' character style into place. You can apply
    any single character style to the same text and see them 'nesting'."

  body: I have a copy of Glyphs and while I want to like it, the interface seems particularly
    weird to me. In order to kern two glyphs I have to put the cursor to the left
    of the first glyph in the pair. Wouldn't it make more sense to put the cursor
    between the two glyphs to be kerned?

  body: "Glyphs takes a while to get used to. The trick is just accepting the simplicity
    of it. Glyphs can seem really infuriating because Georg tries to keep most functions
    in one window as opposed to a collection of windows and palettes. So you have
    to force yourself to just work with the one window instead of jumping back and
    forth between the glyph window, the font window, the metrics window, and the preview
    window. I forced myself to use it full time for a week to wrap my head around
    it. Once you do get used to Glyphs the consolidated interface saves a lot of time.
    Especially once you realize that the Glyphs interface mostly obviates the need
    for Prepolator and makes multiple master development a breeze.\r\n\r\nAs for kerning,
    are you using an old version of Glyphs? I have the latest version and it works
    with either the cursor between the two glyphs or by selecting either glyph and
    entering numeric values into the kern value box."

    I don't have the time to live with this thing for a week to figure it out.\r\n\r\nBack

    bad habits ;)\r\nPlease take a look of the image I\u2019ve posted here.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/how-to-kern-with-glyphs-app_4830.gif]\r\nPlease
    take also in account you can forget the FL kerning-groups table. Just add your
    group name into the info box below your current glyph. You\u2019ll see two \u201CG:\u201D
    labels, one for the left group, the other for the right one. \r\n \r\nYou may
    also change the values of several of them at once in the panel at the bottom left
    of the main font view."

  body: "Hi James. \r\nConsidering you have typed VAY (as in the image above)\r\nYou
    can place the cursor between the V and the A. Then change the bottom left number
    in the info box. Or use the shortcut ctrl+opt+(shift)+left/right arrow keys. This
    is how I usually do it.\r\nAdditionally, without moving the cursor, you can adjust
    the kerning on the AY pair. By editing the value in the lower right corner of
    the info box. Or use the command cmd+opt+(shift)+left/right arrow keys.\r\n\r\nThe
    keyboard shortcuts for changing the metrics are quite similar, just without the
    option key.\r\n\r\nFrom the three command keys next to the space, the left one
    (ctrl) modifies the left side of the selected letter and the right key (cmd) changes
    the right side of the letter. \r\n\r\nThe shortcuts are not very obvious at first,
    but you get used to it after a few minutes.  \r\n\r\nAnd it helps if you change
    the shortcut for Spotlight (e.g. to ctrl+space, this also helps in Adobe apps)
    and Spaces in the system preferences. "

  body: "James,\r\nI have no problem with the FLS Metrics Window (except that tabbing
    through places a zero as a data point forever.  If you delete it, it stays a zero.
    The problem I have with FontLab deals mostly with opportunities to do things that
    a computer does well are often missed. Error reporting is a guessing game.  There
    should be an error message that tells you clearly what your error was and how
    to fix it.  It should even open the screen or panel or whatever, to the location
    of where that particular error can be fixed.  Also, errors should be prevented
    by having the software keep track of all data entries and prompting the proper
    solution. For example, if I attempt to place a glyph in 2 opposing kerning classes.
    There should be an audible beep and the error message \"glyph yacute is already
    in a Left-side kerning group called \"_y.L\" Would you like to remove it from
    that Class? [at this point the class in question should pop up on the screen at
    the proper location.]  I should not have to wait until I generate the font to
    get a cryptic error message which can only be understood by a computer programmer.
    When their is an error in coding features, we should get a prompt such as \"Syntax
    error--semicolon required at line ending\""

  body: "Sorry Ralf, but your wording was understood by Charles to mean that character
    styles themself can be nested -- more than one style applied to the same text.
    Now that seems impossible in InDesign, as \"Character Style\" is a singleton text
    attribute, just like \"font\" (obviously you cannot assign two fonts at the same
    text), size, color, et cetera. (The very weird thing is that a GREP style suddenly
    <em>can</em> be applied on top of each other and on top of other char styles,
    so it's not an obvious problem for ID's internal structure.)\r\n\r\nI would hesitate
    to call a series of char styles in a single paragraph \"nested\". I think I'd
    just say they are \"applied\" or \"used\", like you can use several fonts in a
    single paragraph. The notion of \"nesting\" implies \"on top of each other\";
    at least, that is my view when I read this term."
