    shocked that the design office was a desk with a computer and a scanner. I\u2019ll
    never forget my summer at an ad agency when I drove people nuts by showing up
    at concept meetings with piles of sketched ideas. I prefer working at home because
    I have my big drawing board right there, and even though you\u2019ll never see
    anything drawn by hand in my work, I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m ever going
    to stop working with triangles, brushes, and Micron pens. And I get really confused
    that so many other young designers don\u2019t want to work at a drawing board."

  body: "@ James...I think it's just a way of working. I agree that when you sit down,
    without the computer in front of you, and just think and let it \"flow\" it does
    come out quite quickly. That said, sometimes the idea is already in your head,
    and all you need is the told to complete it!\r\n\r\nAnyways, on the side of sketches/pads/paper/pens..here's

    to make you smile..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Some of us are extremely lucky we have the backgrounds we do in the graphic
    arts. I remember computers (MACs) coming on the scene in NY in 1988. I had a type
    shop and was the second or third to have a MAC \"research & development\" area
    in the shop. I remember telling my customers (mostly book publishers - when they
    were still independently owned) that the computer was only one more tool - like
    a t-square and rubber cement were.\r\n\r\nIt became so much more than that. So
    many of us lost our incomes and lives (and not necessarily in that order). Funny
    how times change... Now everyone can be unemployed - LOL"
