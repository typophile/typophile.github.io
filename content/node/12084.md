    on <a href="http://typographi.com/000998.php" target="_blank">Typographica</a>,
    but I still would like to state that I think that this sure is one fabulous dummy
    text resource.. <em>Thank you.. ( Maybe you should add this to the brandnew '<a
    href="http://typophile.com/wiki/start" target="_blank">Typowiki</a>', as well.?
    )</em>

    body: You're welcome! Thanks for the tip on the [[start | Typowiki]]. I've added
      [[adhesiontext]] and a couple of other [[Text Tools]]. (just hope I made it
      the right way...)

  body: Just wanted to say congratulations... It's wonderful! I'm glad you're making
    the most out of the Reading experience. I heard about it from Dan and I had instant
    flashbacks to the first sketches :)

      gladly it has changed a lot since that time ;)

      body: "Actually I was refering to my own sketches :)\r\n\r\nIs it possible for
        your program to support Arabic?\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be great if fontlab had
        a window where you can input large amounts of text and maybe use a program
        like yours to create dummy text based on existing glyphs? \r\n\r\nhmm..."

        body: "I'm glad you touch that subject. It crossed my mind while I was implementing
          the Greek.\r\nActually it would be very interesting and challenging to add
          a right-to-left script to [[adhesiontext]].\r\n\r\nI believe that the way
          [[adhesiontext]] is setup allows me to add any Latin language, like German
          or Italian for example (and maybe even a central-European, like Czech),
          within a couple of hours.\r\nA non-Latin LTR script would need a bit more
          time, but surely not more than a day's work.\r\nA RTL script is a bit more
          tricky, but still doable. I can't predict how long that would take.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
          if you can provide me two Arabic word-lists (one in Unicode and the other
          in Arabic-Windows-1256) and a string of the characters (in Unicode) to be
          included in the \"Insert characters\" palette, I can try to prepare an Arabic
          version of [[adhesiontext]] for you to test.\r\n\r\nAs for the Fontlab window,
          I think that Brook was trying to do something like that with Python."

  body: Yes - I was working on a script that takes your current character set and
    creates a custom dictionary from a dict file you select. It doesn't spit out a
    nice psuedo paragraph like adhesiontext does though, but the aim was to do something
    similar eventually.

  body: "mike, great work, one thing though: on firefox (1.03, windows 2000), the
    \ layout is kinda messed up. I get a \"insert characters\" box directly over the
    \"get text\" \"basic punctuation\" and \"capitalize words\" fields, which makes
    it pretty much unusable.\r\nOn IE, those boxes render at the very bottom of the
    page. I kind of suspect they should be to the right but without overlapping anything.
    I'd be happy to p\xF3st screenshots if needed. "
