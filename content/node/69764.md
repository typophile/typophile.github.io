body: I'm currently finishing up my first year of studying graphic design but I find
  myself already looking ahead towards grad school. While my dream is to receive my
  MFA from CalArts, I can't help but think realistically and speculate my chances
  of getting into the program. Don't get me wrong, I'm very proud and confident in
  the work that I've produced thus far, but I also go to a normal public university.
  While I absolutely love my instructors and believe in their abilities, my school
  isn't necessarily known for it's art department, and we have limited resources,
  especially when compared to our somewhat of a neighbor VCU (about 2 hours away).
  It's hard not to think that they've already got the upper hand for acceptance into
  grad programs and even the career field considering how well known and prestigious
  their program is. At the same time I truly believe that I'm just as hungry and have
  an equal amount of passion for design as any of those arrogant Richmond kids do,
  and that's what drives me to learn more and become better. But is that enough to
  mold me into a worthy CalArts student?

    kids arrogant, but rather energetic, inquisitive and willing to go the long haul.
    In the whole time I have been associated with them I have only had one \"slug.\"
    \r\n\r\nTransfer to VCU. My exposure to CalArts was through Ed Fella when I lectured
    in New Orleans along side him. If he is representative of that school then you
    are way better off going somewhere else. IMHO\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: p.s. They have taken a hit in the last years as the result of the reorganization,
    the death of Meggs, retirement of several good people. So, make the best of what
    you have. I never even went to school for this stuff and it was no impediment!
    It has always baffled me that people think BS, MoreS, Piled Higher and Deeper
    is the ticket to heaven.

  body: "When you finish your studies and move to real world, your degree is of not
    much use. Design companies look at your portfolio, not your degree.\r\n\r\nI went
    to two different design colleges, but never got a degree. I was hired due to my
    portfolio. Nobody asked for a degree.\r\n\r\nIf you have talent, hone it and get
    better; use your hours to get better at what you do, and how you do it. I actually
    believe that 10 000 hours of work makes you good. But take care to have a life
    as well; burrowing into one direction is not getting you anywhere. Be curious.
    And keep learning the tools of the trade; if your skills on Illustrator prevent
    you from doing what you want to do, it means you need more studying. That's how
    I made it.\r\n\r\nGood luck."

  body: Speaking as someone without a design degree (my degree is in English), I can
    say that when I've been looking for jobs, the fact that I didn't have a design
    degree kept me from getting called for interviews, so I never had the chance to
    show those people my portfolio (even though I had ten years of experience). So
    although those hiring might really only care about what's in your portfolio, there's
    a good chance they might not call you to look at your portfolio without an applicable
    degree.
