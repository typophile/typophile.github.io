  letters along with a monotype matrix. I\u2019m going to have to get it home, and
  I don\u2019t want to pay to mail this heavy stuff. I can put most of it in a bag
  and check it to get the stuff home, but I expect that the airline and the TSA will
  frown on me taking lead type on a plane, checked or carry-on. Does anyone have experience
  flying with lead type?"

  body: Everyone that went to TypeCon got some lead type. If its a large amount they
    may frown, but I think its legal. They will catch it at the gate and inspect,
    but shouldn't be a problem as long as the overall weight is OK.

    bag/box. If it''s in hand luggage you might want to let them know before it goes
    through the x-ray machine... http://www.typecon.com/talk.php?id=271 '

    so who knows?\r\n\r\nI think the bigger issue is weight, eh? Might be cheapest/easiest
    to walk over to a FedEx or UPS store and have it shipped ground freight."

    set a threatening line out of it. With sizes of 48 and 60 pt that would be quite
    a lethal weapon."

    metalic things in my hand luggage*. Security was visibly uneasy**, and they asked
    me for all the details, but in the end they didn't take too long to clear it.
    They actually had a lot more trouble with the bottle of water and the can of ice
    tea I'd forgotten to \"process\". As a security lady at Burbank airport once confided
    to me: \"We hate water.\" Feared substance du jour.\r\n\r\n* http://www.typophile.com/node/44243\r\n\r\n**
    Being Middle-Eastern-Looking couldn't have helped.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Once I had a box of pastels. They called me right up when they saw the cylindrical
    shapes inside a box thru the xRay thing... They will bother you but you can transport
    that. Just be ready to justify in a slow paced talk :) Have fun . Will take 45
    minutes ...

  body: I had an issue last year with [[http://www.helveticafilm.com/newblog/2007/07/26/lead-type-and-homeland-security/|lead
    type in my checked baggage.]] I think the lead tripped a red flag in their x-ray,
    and they pulled the bag to be opened and hand-inspected, which caused that bag
    to miss my connecting flight, so the bag was AWOL for a few days. So yes, you
    can check it, but it may delay that bag.
