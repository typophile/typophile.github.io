  he (michael schwab, the designer uses a typeface to get started, even though he
  does the final work by hand, or has a method of distressing the type). In fact,
  I used to know the name of this font and I have it. I just can't remember. Your
  help is much appreciated.  -m[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mysteryfont_3736.jpg]"

  body: "Schwab paints his letters by hand or uses a proprietary typeface, not available
    to the general public. We have listed alternative fonts in previous threads that
    I can't find right now. Here are a few:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fountain/borgstrand_regular/\">Borgstrand</a>\r\n<a

  body: Thanks, Stephen. I did notice dissimilarities in the sample and my suggestion,
    and it was driving me a bit mental trying to think of an exact match. You always
    amaze me.

  body: "\r\nNo offense, and I do sincerely appreciate your help, but there is an
    existing typeface, maybe 99.9 percent close to his proprietary typeface (which
    makes sense considering he probably too an existing face and altered it slightly
    if in fact it is custom). These are all great examples provided but none of quite
    hit the nail on the head. A cross between Neutraface and Eagle would be excellent.
    I just can't find the one I have used in the past that is very very close.  But
    I used Neutraface for what I needed and just altered some. Thanks again, appreciated.
