  company name is Kit Condensed. (Sample attached.)\r\nI don't want to have to buy
  it just to type one line.\r\nCan somebody suggest a font similar that the customer
  may not notice the differences?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5501.gif]"

    has a more similar S. I have both and I can set the line you need. E-mail me at
