  himself but am having great troubles along the way, debit card denied and the site
  contact form not working either, to mention a few.\r\n\r\nFirstly - Hubert if you
  pick this thread up, could we perhaps talk to resolve this as i need the typeface
  as a matter or urgency?\r\n\r\nSecondly - if any one is in regular contact with
  him could you mention this, or if any one knows of any alternative contact details?\r\n\r\nAll
  help is greatly appriciated\r\n\r\nLuey\r\nfrancis.design@gmail.com\r\n"

    try again. I have sent aou an email with a procedure attached. Sometime it is
    only the expiring date.\r\nYesterday I had problems, because for some strange
    reason my providers server was on a spam blacklist in the USA.\r\nSo some emails
    could not be delivered. I hope this helps.\r\nHubert"
