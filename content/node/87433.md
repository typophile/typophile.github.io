body: "I am trying to change the way FontStruct fonts are displayed and uploaded into
  my Mac FontBook.\r\n\r\nThis is what I get, when I double click on a Fontstruct
  Font.\r\nThis is just before FontBook fully opens.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pix-eu.dontstayin.com/79238fb9-023a-4211-8dba-7bf5af3a61ea.png\"
  width=\"370\" height=\"140\" border=\"0\">\r\n\r\nEvery other font display the full
  alphabet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I uploaded the font into FontLab, and in the section <strong>Font
  Info> Additional Opentype names</strong> was this:-\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pix-eu.dontstayin.com/b92e7127-730f-4702-ac80-0179a8f48d48.png\"
  width=\"607\" height=\"344\" border=\"0\">\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I deleted it all, like
  this:-\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pix-eu.dontstayin.com/2ef8d7cf-d2f1-48d6-85a7-c2de89beca61.png\"
  width=\"607\" height=\"344\" border=\"0\">\r\n\r\nand clicked Apply. Saved the font,
  and reinstalled it. \r\n\r\nDouble clicked on the file again, and I still get this:-\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://pix-eu.dontstayin.com/79238fb9-023a-4211-8dba-7bf5af3a61ea.png\" width=\"370\"
  height=\"140\" border=\"0\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso when I'm in FontBook, and click <strong>Preview
  > Sample</strong>, I still get this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pix-eu.dontstayin.com/abdaea5f-c3c4-4c84-91ed-b6f1259b04ee.png\"
  width=\"528\" height=\"220\" border=\"0\">\r\n\r\nEvery other font displays the
  full Alphabet, upper, lower & numerals.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to change this so it
  displays properly?\r\nIt's driving me crazy.\r\n\r\nI've cleared the Font cache
  already.\r\nIt's only really happened when I installed Snow Leopard recently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hmm \u2026 I just followed your process and it seems to work fine. Are you
    sure you deleted the old version of the font before re-generating it? (Have a
    look in ~/Library/Fonts, that\u2019s the directory that FontBook uses to store
    user-installed fonts.)"

  body: After messing around with the file sent to me by Nippa, I managed to get rid
    of the "Five zephyrs" text by changing the "Generating OpenType" preference from
    "Append OpenType name records" to "Export only OpenType name records." Having
    this option set requires that all of the name records are present in the "Additonal
    OpenType names" table, so I deleted the Sample text entries, then re-imported
    the default names (first button at the top). Generating that finally produced
    a TTF without the sample text entries. No idea why they persisted in "Append"
    mode after deleting them, since they're not present anywhere in what the manual
    refers to as the "friendly" sections of the Font Info dialog.

    bow in awe of your skills.\r\n\r\nI've just spoken to Rob Meek - the creative
    genius behind Fontstruct.\r\nHe said he'll look into changing some of the coding,
    so it should be more flexible, and usable in FontLab.\r\n\r\nWhich should hopefully
    alleviate any future dilemmas."
