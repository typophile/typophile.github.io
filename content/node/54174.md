  piece by Matisse is a well known example of Fauvism. It perfectly exemplifies the
  non-realistic use of color. Although it was not widely accepted in its early years,
  the use of vivid, non-naturalistic, and exuberant color is what makes this time
  period unique. This was the first period in which color ruled supreme. I rather
  like the unnatural use color used to spice things up a bit. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/picasso_1_4601.jpg]\r\n\r\nInvented
  by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Cubism to me is the most radical and most innovative
  time in art's history. These guys took spicing things up to a whole other level.
  I don't necessarily like all of it, but the concept behind the work is pretty solid.
  They distorted images, wanting to break away from the conventional. The works are
  broken and abstracted, meant to demonstrate the mind's ability to abstract the natural
  world. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PotsdamerPlatz_Kirchner_4618.jpg]\r\nThe
  exaggerated imagery displayed in the Expressionist period really speaks to its audience.
  This time period used symbolic colors within ordinary, everyday scenes. These works
  reflect the artist's state of mind rather than the reality of the external world.
  Expressionism was meant to give the viewer an emotional. "
