  I'm a communication studies major and my study deals a lot with the perception and
  understanding of messages, especially when it comes to typography and design.\r\n\r\nI'm
  very new to the whole process on fonts and what not. I stumbled across this community
  of typography fans, and was curious if you have any tips (any sort of tips, really).\r\n\r\nIn
  the realm of higher education, how important is the font? What are some requirements
  of representing colleges and universities through various font families?\r\n\r\n[disclaimer:
  I go to The College of Wooster in Ohio]\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!"

    of your current thinking, research you may have already done, or a working thesis,
    e.g., \"typography is the most/least important element of in higher education
    branding.\"\r\n\r\nTypophile is helpful place, but can't/won't do your thinking
    for you."

  body: "Of course. I was hoping this would allow me to sort of talk things out and
    make sure I have a sense of direction on where to go.\r\n\r\nA better way to put
    this might be, \"how useful is typography in conveying atmosphere?\"\r\n\r\nMy
    school is a unique place. Every college is. But the way in which it is represented
    graphically is not unique. Look at Denison, to which Wooster is often compared
    to. Very similar styling. Our website (www.wooster.edu) prominently features our
    wordmark proudly in Palatino  (slightly modified). Palatino, in my opinion, is
    in no way a unique family and doesn't quite do our school justice. When I look
    at Rhodes College and their wordmark for example, I see character. I get an understanding
    of the feel of the place (somewhat). I'm looking to find a way to convey that
    about my school. \r\n\r\nThe focus groups I'm currently holding are looking to
    find the root of the identity of Wooster. The values of which I'm finding is that
    Wooster is quirky, fun, and a place where creativity flows unaltered. \r\n\r\nAbove
    all I'm curious about meaning behind typefaces. They fascinate me in regards to
    how we understand brands, like colleges.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."

    element of identity design. \r\n\r\nYou also might want to see if any university
    officials would be willing to give you their views about the university's identity.
    Heck, call the president's office and ask if he'd be willing to give you 10 minutes.
    He might just surprise you and say yes.\r\n\r\nI'd also suggest compiling a collection
    of current logos & tag lines from other universities, both for inspiration and
    also to avoid accidentally coming up with one that's too similar to an existing
    logo. You'll especially want to know what logos are being used by universities
    that the administration views as \"the competition\". \r\n"

    And fonts -being systems of shapes-\r\ncertainly do convey moods.\r\n\r\nThe main
    question is: what atmosphere do you want to project?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
