    I'll usually research the reviews on CNET to get an idea of price ranges and what
    features I should be looking for.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/4566-3180_7-0.html?tag=dir&sort=edRating7+desc\">CNET

  body: I usually do what ken said, but, if available, look at customer reviews. You
