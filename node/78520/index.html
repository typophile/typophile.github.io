Unless by "English" you mean of English origin, not simply a Roman-alphabet typeface, which can be used for printing English. In that case, I suppose you are rooting for Gill Sans.</div>

who let you onto typophile?

don't you know that, to be in good stead here,
you _must_ judge films by their typefaces?

ok, you can have one more chance, but don't let this
happen again, not if you know what's good for you...

However, the German magazine <em>Signal</em> occasionally used Gill Sans (the modified European version) during WWII, so WTF.

It always strikes me as strange that different aspects of the mise-en-scène in a film can vary so much in authenticity.
Costume, make-up and hair styles, set decoration, and music (often patently anachronistic), as well as typography.
I wasn't totally convinced by the accent of Rush and Firth, which seemed a little too modern (i.e. 50 years after), and Firth not quite aristocratic enough. Bonham-Carter was spot on though, very plummy.</div>

Definitely.
Consistent and knowing departures from the period (such as the soundtrack to Marie Antoinette) are a filmic device, but anachronisms ruin it for me.

Me too. I don't mind an anachronism if it's pointed (Aphex Twin in <em>Marie Antoinette</em> was its one redeeming feature, IMO!), but when it appears to be done through ignorance or mere favoritism, not so hot.</div>

And even the sky in the background looks very contemporary, due to the air pollution that is totally different from the one in the pre-war days when coal was the main fuel used for heating and cooking.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I could defend the film by advancing the theory that Edward VIII was actually a British spy who managed to advance the Allied cause against Hitler, or defend Churchill by noting that Gandhi's pressure for independence for India an a rapid timetable contributed to the bloodshed which the forces seeking partition for Pakistan unleashed.

However, I've brought already far too much politics into this forum, and these would be extreme longshots, so I think I'll leave Christopher Hitchens alone. Churchill, at least, has a reputation that is safe from any naysayers.

As for Eric Gill: while Gill Sans would have been the appropriate choice, given recent revelations about his personal life, and the increasing awareness of the rights of women and the needs of the victims of sexual violence, and the dependence of a movie studio on its image and public goodwill... avoiding his typeface was only to be expected.</div>

So I guess we just throw away all of those great typefaces. Hell, let's burn all printed materials that feature anything Gill did! Let's deface all of the stonework he did! ERADICATE IT! Just face it: everyone has demons. While the things Gill did in his private life are shocking, those things are separate from his contributions to typography.

Enough about that, though. Back to the original topic, I drive my friends nuts commenting on type inaccuracies in modern period pieces. I don't remember what I was watching but it was a low-budget kind of thing set in the 40s or 50s and they made the mistake of using Arial. I died a little on the inside.</div>

Although you are right that making Eric Gill into an unperson is not appropriate either, movie studios, at least in the United States, are in a difficult position. Even while they make their money most effectively when pandering to our baser instincts, they must constantly struggle to prove to the American people that, no, they really aren't corrupting the youth of the nation.

Thus, they are vulnerable to the activities of single-issue political organizations. Whether these organizations act on behalf of conservative religious denominations, the disabled, or women whose children have been killed by drunk drivers, or women who seek greater equality with men, they wield great power over vulnerable industries that are dependent on public goodwill to sell their products.

I could mention the pentagram in the background that was removed from the Magic: the Gathering card "Unholy Strength".

I could mention the immense controversy that surrounded the movie "Tropic Thunder", in which the moviemakers decided to have the soldiers portrayed in it use the word "retard" as a pejorative term, rather than the stronger language real-life soldiers might use.

Then, there is the immense controversy that surrounded the movie "The Passion of the Christ", which was essentially a traditional depiction of the life of Christ in the manner in which emphasis is given to its components within the Roman Catholic faith, which ended up driving Mel Gibson to drink and ruin.

And, so, if a Hollywood movie studio can find a way to avoid annoying one of the major pressure groups out there... they will take it.</div>

Colin:

Sorry, I don't think Firth cuts it.
He sounds like Bluebottle (Goon Show): George had a certain repose, as befits a king, despite the pauses.
In fact his speech mannerism becomes a kind of affectation.
Firth puts too much melodrama (never mind the music) into it, making the mannerism a debility. Too strident, too much variation in pitch, for one thing, too high a pitch for another. George is so much more relaxed, more musical and poetic in delivery than Firth's theatrical struggle. 




Bonham-Carter was excellent. Reminded me of several snooty upper-crust women I've known.</div>

OK, <em>that's</em> an unacceptable anachronism. The credits can be in whatever typeface, because they're part of the real world, when the movie was made.

I actually went to the movie at the request of a reporter for The Telegraph. I wanted to see it anyway, but it made a nice excuse to take a break from FontLab. (If anyone is curious, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8285855/Oscar-nominated-film-The-Kings-Speech-littered-with-errors.html">here's the article</a>.)

A million times worse than the Helvetica was the fact that someone started talking on a cell phone just outside the theater during a critical scene. It was so distracting that I completely missed what was said in the scene. I'll take the occasional anachronism over that any day.</div>

Not quite so categorically cut and dried.
I await the "Dogme" version, made with original equipment.

I also found the casting disconcerting, in that some characters were very much look-alikes, while others, such as the two leads, were not.

In general, knowing something of the original history, I was aware of all sorts of dialectics between the authentic and the interpretive. So I would fault the film for not being more consistent in this respect, and that is probably the producer's responsibility.

Nonetheless, it was a great movie and I enjoyed every minute of it.
