Also, I wonder whether you're trying to recreate something more photorealistic based on the flashy and expensive film production company logos you see at the beginning of films...I'd forget that for now and try and work out exactly how you want to say what you want to say.


i.e, it doesn't have to be a literal "oh riiiiight, it's a compass cause it's about bearings" concept.

sailing, landscape, discovery, shifting view/perspective/location etc etc etc

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Paul. You're right in that I'm thinking about the awesome intro animation of a compass spinning then stopping and melting into the logo.

I knew the stopwatch would become an issue.

As for the meaning of the compass and name. The client wanted a logo that showed the direction from Hollywood to Ottawa (Where the company started). I know he and his partner like the compass idea so I would have to sell them pretty hard on something else. I'll try harder to think about it outside the box.</div>

the compass is more of a star. Looking more like a star could definitely be a plus too, like the company produces stars lol. it'd be a very subtle subconscious design element, maybe.</div>

I think you've got a good start and a few interesting design directions to choose from. I also think you should develop and sell the compass mark by itself instead of clumsily trying to lock it in with some random typeface. Choose a typeface later when a mark has been decided on.</div>

It's your call. In any case do make sure you know the story behind that logo. It was designed by one logo designer for another, and latter happened to be a fraud and made a big fuss when he got caught. I am sure the ripples from that incident will eventually subside, but there is still a plenty of people in the logo design community who react nervously to that logo. This is in part why I remembered the logo in the first place.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I tried to read up on the story but I'm not sure exactly what happened. From what I understand, the logo was used by a designer that would steal stock art and make logos from them. Is that the story?

I had never seen that logo until you showed me. Is mine that similar? The lines are not at 90 degrees nor is there an inner arrow. Those are 3 pieces of a compass rose that I illustrated myself, inspired by the art shared by "ishbog" above.


Yes the type is Alte Haas. I love the rounded corners so much. There is a company called Fido that does all of their promotional pieces with this style of type. I'm not sure if it is Alte Haas exactly. 

Can you suggest a type like this one that is bit more unique?</div>

I really like where this logo is going.

Given the angularity of the mark and the point it makes, I think modifying the face to have sharp corners might be something to explore. </div>

can also see this being built as a kind of abstract 3d model too...

infact, maybe that would give it a nice point of difference, just a different view of the compass points i.e, 3/4 front view.

Perhaps have a look at <a href=http://www.paragraph.com.au/mentone.html>Mentone</a>? Alternatively, and I realize it's a heresy, you can take any font and simply add a stroke around it with rounded joints.

BTW I know of Fido and I really really like their slightly rounded font. I am too not sure if it's Alte Haas. It looks like it, but given the size of Fido I think they are more likely to commission the replica than to use an (effectively) abandoned font.

(edit)

Here's what I meant by adding a stroke to round the type. Top is Alright Sans Medium, bottom is Alright Sans Regular padded with stroke with rounded corners. You can see some distortion in letterforms, especially in /r/ and /e/, but it is not <em>that</em> bad.

Bold/Regular

Medium/Light

Right now I feel that Medium/Light matches the mark best. </div>
