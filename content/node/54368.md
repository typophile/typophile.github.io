    qualified to redraw it yourself and do a better job. So... go for it dude : )\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Michael - If it were only the type above, I wouldn't mind. Unfortunately,
    they use the same font on 6-8 different words on the piece I have to recreate.
    Too busy right now to deal with it!\r\n\r\nI'm going to try to talk her out of
    that font altogether. Tracing all of it would take more art time than they are
    willing to pay for (hopefully). \r\n\r\nCheers :)"
