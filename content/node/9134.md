  body: John what I would do is set it in a slab serif like Giza and then use Mr.
    Retro&#39;s Washing Machine to create the distressed look. Since Mr. Retro does
    this using a layer mask its easy to control the amount of distress in the mark.

  body: In the sample, the &#39;e&#39;s all have the same marks which leads me to
    believe that the distressing is part of the font. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/playbill/playbill/testdrive.html?s=Beef+Steak&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Playbill</a> comes close without the distressing &#40;you&#39;d
    have to stretch it a bit&#41;. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: Thanks. I have the feeling it&#39;s some freebie downloadable grunge font.
    Slim Jim &#40;one of my clients&#41; used lots of them in their &#39;90s redesign
    to give them teenage cred.
