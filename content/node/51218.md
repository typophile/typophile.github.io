  obviously not Lacrima or Remington .. tried to find it via Identifont & WhatTheFont,
  but there was no match.\r\n\r\nThe image is scanned from an art-advertisement (2001).
  \ I guess i remember the font being also used in the artwork of fugazi's album end
  hits (1998)."

  body: It very well could be from a typewriter. Similar to <a href="www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/script_12_pitch_roman_ot/?sample_text=Gallery%20Serge%20Ziegler%3A">Script
    12 Pitch</a> which is based on a font from a typewriter wheel. See also <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/monoline_script_std_regular/?sample_text=Gallery%20Serge%20Ziegler%3A">Monoline
    Script</a>.

  body: "Yes, i also think it comes from a typewriter, like Script 12 Pitch or Light
    Italic, the inspiration for Lacrima. I suppose it has been digitalized in the
    '90s or even before. I saw it as a postscript-font some years ago, but cannot
    remember the name. \r\n:-("
