body: "Hello,\r\nI need some advice on hanging indents in InDesign. \r\n\r\nI would
  like the bullet points of a par to align outside the margin of the text (see attached
  image LH column). The only way I can seem to achieve this is to indent the normal
  body copy and heads. Is this the right way to do it? Seems like I need to reset
  all of my body copy indents to make this work. Then it don't align with my grid
  (ie page heads are 4mm out of whack).\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense and someone can
  help.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nJason."

  body: "Hello Jason,\r\n\r\nSorry for my English, I don't know if it is this that
    you want, I can't fully understand your question :-D\r\n\r\nThe way I would do
    is to have a Paragraph Style with all the text indentend at 4mm and then have
    the bullets lines with a paragraph first line at -2 (this is because Indesign
    can't indent text outside the text box frame). For this to work your text box
    would have to 'include' the gutter.\r\n\r\nIf you only have a few lines to put
    the bullets into you could think of having two paragraph styles, one 'normal'
    and one like I mentioned above. You would then have two types of text boxes: the
    'normal' ones without the gutter and the 'bullet' ones (linked) when you need
    them.\r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\nAll the best\r\n\r\nPedro Monteiro\r\nhttp://whatype.wordpress.com/"

    Create a new bullet style with a tab equal to the length of the indent\r\n3. Set
    the <em>Space After</em> for the bullets\r\n4. Insert <em>Indent to Here</em>
    symbols before the first letter of each bulleted sentence\r\n5. Apply the Bullet
    style to the text you wish to negatively indent.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bullets_4719.gif]\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "Thanks all for your input. I thought this was the way to do it - however
    it mucks with the column alignment (ie. if I have a 3 column grid and a text box
    with 3 columns set with an indent of 4mm and a hanging bullet of -4mm, it doesn't
    align correctly with the grid. I think I'll just hang the bullets like I normally
    do - with the bullet aligned to the left of the column along with the text and
    indented 4mm.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "I faced this problem today, with line numbers that hang into the left margin.
    Our old program (TeX) had llap (left lap) and rlap; I'd sure like to see them
    implemented with InDesign.\r\n\r\nWhat worked was to go into the font & make up
    a zero-width character (U+200B). Set that character first, then your line number,
    then an em-space (or whatever clearance you want), then begin your text. Put a
    1,000 unit negative kern between the zero-width character and the line number
    (or bullet, or whatever). That is the most ID CS2 will allow. But you can change
    the actual distance the copy moves left by varying the size of the \"zero-width\"
    character. Since it has no width, it doesn't push the copy inward as the point
    size goes up, it just moves left.\r\n\r\nI could move the line numbers off the
    page by using a large point size zero-width character with a -1,000 unit kern
    to the line number. Just pick the size that places things as you want. \r\n\r\nIf
    you are using multiple digits, set up using tabular numbers for the line numbers.
    As long as you are making up a zero-width space, make up a figure space for padding
    if needed. We pre-program all this into an InDesign-tagged-text file with a character
    style around the line numbers, but all that saves is time, the technique will
    work with direct formatting.\r\n\r\nNot a replacement for reverse carriage, or
    the better tools of llap & rlap, but it does work.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
