  Typeface. 1949"> <BR> <BR> I found this very intressting typface at some notebook-frontpages.
  &#40;The books are printed in 1949 in norway&#41; <BR> <BR> It seems familiar but
  i&#39;ve got hard to tell the name of it. Sorry for the bad quality and the small
  amount of letters. <BR> <BR>Any ideas?   would even like to see faces with simularities,
  though i am planning to reconstruct a face like this one.
