  KING PUBLISHING <BR> <BR>This classic book, first published in 1983 and updated
  in 1990, helps designers to recognize and identify typefaces seen and used on an
  everyday basis, and also provides assistance with the process of typeface selection.
  It highlights the essential characteristics of over 700 typeface specimens, all
  fully cross-referenced to a comprehensive index. Typefaces are grouped according
  to specific design features and the typefinding process is by visual inspection
  and elimination. &#39;Earmark&#39; or letter feature tables offer an alternative
  but companion method of identifying text typefaces, illustrating the more distinctive
  and unusual identifying features of letters. Each category of typeface is prefaced
  with an introduction by Phil Baines examining its historical background. The book
  also contains an eight-page section of fifty brief biographies of leading type designers.

  body: I picked up a copy of the American edition of this about a month ago and it&#39;s
    one of the most valuable resources I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s not comprehensive;
    its coverage of the sans serif explosion of the last 10-15 years is spotty at
    best. But it&#39;s got a good range of exemplars from all of the major historical
    periods in type design, and its tables of earmark characters is a fascinating
    study resource in its own right. I&#39;m still mostly a newbie to typography,
    and I can sit and stare at it for hours.
