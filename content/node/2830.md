body: I&#39;ve been looking for this font forever. It&#39;s from a comic book called
  Negative Exposure by Humanoids Publishing. The font is used on the credits page
  as well as other, &#34;next issue&#34;-type headlines. I&#39;ve also seen it used
  in other Humanoids ads and I think I may have seen it elsewhere. Does anyone recognize
  it...or know of a similar font? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24812.jpg"
