  body: Well you may laugh at my request, but I'm in a position where I have to lay
    out a document for a brand and the agency I'm working for "cannot" provide me
    with their signature font (Bliss)... And well, I'm sorry but I'm not going to
    pay for it myself... They just said "use a similar font". While this is none of
    my work ethics, this job is a real pain in the arse and I want to get it done
    quicky...

  body: "When I saw the subject of this thread, I was expecting someone to suggest
    Chinese characters as a substitute for Bliss symbols - but I see that this is
    not about them.\r\n\r\nMy answer to the poster's original question, now that I've
    found out what Bliss looks like, would be Gill Sans; not a free font, but it might
    be one he already has.\r\n\r\nGill Sans has the same \"feel\" as Bliss, while
    Trebuchet doesn't; on the other hand, Trebuchet has the unusual lowercase l of
    Bliss. So one could use Gill Sans, and then go back and change all the lowercase
    \"l\"s to Trebuchet."

  body: "I realize my suggestion is perhaps even worse than Nick Cooke's suggestion
    \"Arial\", but the weight of Trebuchet differs so slightly from that of at least
    Bitstream's Humanist 521 (if not a more \"real\" Gill Sans) and its ascender height
    is also only slightly higher, so that a naive person might indeed note that the
    \"feel\" of Gill Sans matches that of Bliss (that of Trebuchet conspicuously does
    not; it's more like News Gothic) and then see that, oh, yes, it's got the right
    lowercase \"l\", and so it must be the right font.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the lowercase
    \"p\" and \"q\" have an extra bit that Bliss avoids, though, would still be a
    way to notice that Bliss isn't really being used. But what I suggest is indeed
    a way of \"faking it\"."

  body: Buy Bliss and charge the client more (not necessarily the font's full whack).
    That way, JT gets what he deserves, you get what you deserve (Bliss on your machine)
    and the client gets what they deserve.
