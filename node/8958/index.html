  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all.  Its me again Mr. Newb Layout. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I work for a small town newspaper and my bosses and editor want to change our printing press to one closer in town.   The problem is now we have to resize or paper. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So instead of running 11 inches tall and 14 inches high.  We are not supposedly running 10 inches high and 11.5 inches wide.  This is per page mind you. Also its a 4 column paper. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have been asked to find out how much smaller our ads are going to be and come up with the new dimensions.  I thought this was going to be easy but now I am finding that its not, well at least not me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will create an action to re-size all the ad sizes once I find out all the new dimensions for our ads.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But does anyone have any suggestions on how to do this quickly?  It probably obvisous but just not seeing it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks all for reading and making me look good <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">If I understand you properly, these pages are not proportionate, so a full page ad would reduce approximately 91% horizontally and 82% vertically, obviously not an ideal situation. However, you don't mention the grid which is more critical than actual paper size, if you adjust margins and gutters you might be able to make a proportionate reduction. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The question is how you bill out your advertising.  Per column inch or is it modular? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If it's modular, I'd just figure out the new sizes by doing the whole &quot;1/2 page is this on the old stuff, now it's this.&quot; by just figuring out what a half page is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OR, if your paper wants to keep the same number of column inches is per ad, then I guess it means redesigning all the ad sizes and just phasing out the old stuff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Example&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The newspaper I ran we had our first issue as a tabloid, but every subsequent issue was a broadsheet (50 inch web I believe).  I kept everything as &quot;3 col x 10 in&quot; or so, that way, when the ads that transferred to the next issue, all I had to do was go by my columns by inches. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe that helps, it might just sound confusing&hellip; It is 9 am for me, and I don't think the brain is functioning yet.</div>

I am spending this day try to figure out the re-sizing issue. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim, you said mess with the grid and gutters and maybe I can figure out a porportionate reduction in all my ad sizes?

		<div class="commentbody">Hey I think I did it.  I kept it 4 columns and made the gutter .125 brought in the left and right margins a few smidges and now the ad sizes proportionally scale down to the their correct size (i.e. a quarter page is now a &quot;quarter page&quot;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think.

		<div class="commentbody">Luis, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Try reducing your original grid by 87% (split between the two percentage reductions of the page size). This will change your margins and gutters in both directions. See how this affects the look of the page the side margins will be larger and the footer and header will be smaller (proportionately). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim</div>
