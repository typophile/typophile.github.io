  about this OFL licensed font? I really like it because it strongly reminds me of
  the typeface used in many ethnographic and linguistic books published by the Smithsonian
  Bureau of American Ethnology. I searched around and couldn\u2019t find any serious
  discussions of it, so I\u2019m curious what you experts here think.\r\n\r\nMy greatest
  complaint is that the mathematical operators and arrows are all very oversized in
  comparison to the other glyphs. This is however somewhat in keeping with 19th and
  early 20th century mathematical books that I\u2019ve looked at, where the mathematical
  symbols are clearly not related to the typeface, but are probably a case of sorts
  that are mixed in with any other random face in use. For serious use however, I
  would like to see all the mathematical symbols, even the plebian + and =, scaled
  down to something more reasonable. Because it\u2019s OFL licensed I\u2019m tempted
  to do so, but I always seem to have something more important to do with my time.\r\n\r\nI
  think all this family needs is a good set of superiors and inferiors and a set of
  small caps, and it\u2019s ready for serious use. The bold and bold italic need to
  be designed at some point, but they\u2019re not necessary for book work if section
  and chapter headings are done in some other compatible face."

  body: "Old Standard is similar to Computer Modern (used in TeX), having come from
    the same type traditions.  I think that's why there isn't a strong desire to use
    its mathematics characters.\r\n\r\nI like Old Standard, though, and find it has
    a bit more \"old style elegance\" than Computer Modern.  I hope that people use
    it more."
