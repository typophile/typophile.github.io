  Italics and Small Caps stopped showing up. And now whenever I click on the font's
  name, it automatically goes to Times New Roman. I tried messing with the files,
  and nothing.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows what to do, your help will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nIf
  you use this font and are having (or have had) a similar problem, please also contact
  me."

  body: "Poynter is usually associated with newspapers. I know the Arkansas Democrat
    Gazette uses it - do you work on that paper or a local paper in Conway, or is
    a privately licensed copy of the font? \r\n\r\nI'd agree with Tiffany, contacing
    FBI would be your best bet...  http://www.fontbureau.com/help/contact "
