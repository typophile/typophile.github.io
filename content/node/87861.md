  today), and I'd dearly love to know what its name is. I remember it was used a LOT
  on a children's TV show here in South Africa that I used to watch back when I was
  a kid in the 90s. So, can anybody here PLEASE help me out?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Speckled-Eggs-_6305.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/K-TV-font-sample_4935.jpg]"

    but all the places I looked did not have this under 'curly', and I did  not have
    it in my Script Font ID Guide. \r\n\r\nIt's nice to see you have such faith in
    us that you think we should be able to ID anything, but saying \"Come on, guys!
    No one know? Seriously?!\" doesn't strike me as very polite, considering you are
    not our only 'customer'.\r\n\r\nDid you try writing to the site owners where you
    saw this used?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I did not find these examples on the web; I scanned them from various print
    sources. And yes, I did contact the magazine in which I saw the third example,
    but they replied saying they did not know what the typeface's name was because
    they received the ad from the client company. I contacted this client company
    almost a week ago, but I have yet to receive a reply. (I am not hopeful that I
    will.)\r\nOh, and please don't talk down to me. I wasn't aiming to be rude. Just
    to clarify: that also wasn't me being rude. So don't impose your impressions on
    me please.\r\n(Side-note: I was originally going to say \"Take that stick out
    of your ass,\" but realized just in time that THAT'D be rude.)"

    clever, managing to tell me what you would have said if you WERE rude. \r\n\r\nThe
    fact that your post went unanswered from Nov 29th to Dec 8th may tell you that
    this isn't an easy one to answer, so I felt that saying \"Seriously?\" was uncalled
    for. Usually people just say something like 'Any (other) ideas?\" If that's your
    idea of talking down to you, I suggest you need to lighten up too. We try to answer
    all posts as soon as we can, and I've been here doing this for about 8 1/2 years.
    I looked at thousands of fonts on four different sites before giving you my answer..\r\n\r\n..
    so, you are welcome.  I hope we can all be friends here.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n"

    for the fact that, given my telepathy, I should have known that sarcasm was beyond

    contraire. We all recognize sarcasm.\r\n\r\nAnd you use the word sarcasm as if
    it were a good thing. \r\n\r\nAHD4:\r\n1. A cutting, often ironic remark <em>intended
    to wound.</em>\r\n2. A form of wit that is marked by the use of sarcastic language
    and is <em>intended to make its victim the butt of contempt or ridicule.</em>\r\n\r\nThere
    are a few regulars who often stoop to sarcasm, but most give of their time and
    expertise graciously.\r\n\r\nIf you want help, don't bite the hand that you want
    to feed you. Be snotty at your own risk, especially after constructive criticism."

  body: Constructive criticism my big fat foot. He wanted rudeness, so I showed him
    how I am when I aim to be rude. HE was the one being snotty, I just amplified
    it. As I previously stated, I will not allow anyone to talk down to me. He has
    absolutely no right to. Just because he's been doing this for 8 1/2 years does
    NOT mean I should be forced into supplication before him -- or for anyone else
    for that matter. He made several ASSumptions about me and the situation, and they
    were not appreciated by me. If you wish to misinterpret my words or intentions,
    go right ahead . . . but don't make the mistake of telling me or putting it out
    there so I can find out about it. I have always been polite here and grateful
    for the help I have received here, but I refuse to be grateful for help that stems
    from someone who's clearly got their head up their own butt. And sarcasm can be
    a very, VERY good thing when a situation calls for it. =)

    through net, \r\nfollows it's own rules. \r\nMisinterpretation occurs often, and
    YES you have to explain yourself politely every time it happens instead of biting
    the other.\r\n...and no, sarcasm is proved to NEVER be a good thing, when it comes
    to a first contact through net.\r\n\r\nI thought you had a problem of identifying
    a font, \r\nbut it seems you have a problem of always saying the last word.\r\n\r\nFivos"
