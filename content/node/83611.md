body: I am running a design contest for a logo over at 99designs, and I have created
  an emblem idea. I would like to know if it is already in use by another company.
  Can anyone help? Thanks!

  body: There are millions of logos in use, so it's likely that similar ones exist
    somewhere. If you're doing a logo for a big company, you'd want to do a thorough
    search, but since you're going for bargain-basement logo design I presume this
    is just for small business, so I'd just go to Google Images and search for competitors'
    logos. For example, if your business is "Sam's Deli" I'd search Google Images
    for "logo deli" and "logo sam".
