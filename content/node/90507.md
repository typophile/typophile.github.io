  body: Allowing Google Chrome to translate from the Japanese, the graphic states
    that the font is owned by the Roland Corporation and not for sale.

  body: "Mike, you\u2019re right.\r\n\r\n<em>RBIO-09R and RBIO-09DB are corporate
    fonts of Roland Corporation\u2019s. The fonts have been used for logos etc. for
    their products. The original fonts were RBIO - REGULAR and RBIO - DEMI BOLD digitized
    by Roland about 1995\u20131996. (The typeface had existed before digital-era since
    1980s.) Maniackers Design redesigned them. *Those are corporate fonts, not for
    sale.</em>"
