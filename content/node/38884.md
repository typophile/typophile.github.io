  Was it just to separate the Int and the el, so that I became more obvious that it
  stood for Integrated Electronics or is there a typographic/design reason?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'A designer thought it looked cool and drew it. Their bosses at the agency
    attached some spiel about "synergy" and "dynamics". The Intel bosses liked the
    logo (or fell for the spiel). Later it started to look old/silly and they replaced
    it with Neo Sans. '

  body: Intel is just a word and hard to protect in terms of trade dress. With the
    dropped E, it's now a logo, not a word. Just like the rotated E in Dell.

    poring over a thesaurus seeking the correct wordage with which to impress clients.
    You make it sound so shallow - the design business is much more profound than
    you suggest. ;^P\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "I suppose I should have added \"dramatization\" alongside the post. Anyway
    looks like I was completely wrong... \r\n\r\n\"the original Intel \u201Cdropped-e\u201D
    logo, which was created by Silicon Valley pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore
    37 years ago as they were forming their new \u201Cintegrated electronics\u201D
    company.\"\r\n\r\nvia - http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20060103corp.htm
    \r\n\r\nSo the logo was created by a pair of engineers in 1969. As to the dropped
    e maybe they know - seems like a geeky gimmick to me ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"
