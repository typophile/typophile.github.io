<p>This forum has inspired me a lot. I have started making this font, agnoti. I have never made an entire typeface before but I am ambitious. Its missing some letters, the ones where I cannot find a nice solution. As I have said I&rsquo;ve never made a font before and this is purely for my own pleasure and a good learning experiance.</p>
<p>edit: <em>updated</em></p>
<p>Id really like replies, comments, crits or ideas so that I can finish the font. Thanks for your time. I have attached a pdf(570 KB) and a png.</p>
<p>Best regards,
David Pache</p>

Well my idea for this font is to have some kind of classical type look. I was thinking about crusaders and medievel times while drawing the letters. I assume this is completely another style, but this was my inspiration : <a href="http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/LLH00001/frames?div=3&amp;subdiv=0&amp;locale=en&amp;mode=reference">http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/LLH00001/frames?div=3&amp;subdiv=0&amp;locale=en&amp;mode=reference</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody">David, I think that you should think more about the way broad-nibbed pens write on paper, as that is how letters were written in the middle ages (letters were also painted with a brush, or carved into stone, etc. but those were more for decoration than for reading). I&rsquo;m not saying that you should necessarially copy calligraphic styles, or start writing by hand yourself, but do at least try to think about the tool and its style a bit more. Your &ldquo;m&rdquo; is getting there, the top curve on the &ldquo;a&rdquo; is a neat idea but needs a better transition, but the &ldquo;s&rdquo; is impossible, etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Before I could say a lot, I would have to see more sample than this. But I&rsquo;d say that for the kind of font it is, it&rsquo;s coming along well. I&rsquo;d work on having a consistent color throughout: for example, the o is some lighter than the n, and the eye of the g is even lighter. You can have a serif with somewhat random stress and still have all the characters the same color. Check out <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/">http://www.shinntype.com/</a> Nick Shinn&rsquo;s work, in particular Oneleigh. The tail of your g is interesting, and I haven&rsquo;t decided whether or not I like it. Maybe (maybe) it could come a bit farther right, but I&rsquo;ll let you decide. I think my lack of confidence in criticisms is due to not being able to see in more context how the letters turn out to work together. So&hellip; put up more sample.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What I really meant was could you post a PDF with, like, a few lines or so of running text, or maybe a pangram. You know, show off all your character set. I think the color is getting better. I have to say I kind of liked it when it was a little more jagged. I also like the old e. The w,v,y could do with some flaring on the thin strokes. Overall, I think the concept behind this gives you a lot of freedom to just do whatever&hellip; as long as you make sure it looks good. I think you could do more with faceting, like you did with the n,m,h,u: do it on the a, maybe the b,d,p,q, possibly even the s and o. (But with this concept, avoid monotony too.) Some letters are still bolder than others. I wish some other people would come here and critique this (and while we&rsquo;re at it, my font too), so you could get advice from more than just me. One last thing I&rsquo;d say is work on making them all look like they&rsquo;re related: for example, the s doesn&rsquo;t look like it even knows the rest of the font. (For a good s, I&rsquo;d think maybe Lydian.) The middle serif on the k is totally unrelated. Okay, so pretty soon I&rsquo;ll just be rambling, so I&rsquo;ll stop typing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks again for being so helpful Nathanael, I really appreciate your aid. To make all the letters look like they belong together seems to be the hardest task for me, but Im slowly but surely getting there. As I said earlier, my s is probably the worst character to draw for me (it works better when its rotated 180 degrees!) but Im working on it everyday. I will check out that s you mentionned.
It has really evolved since last year. I do attach some nostaligie to the hard, jagged edges but the soft curved look it has now feels more appropriate for the kind of learning curve I have set myself. Honestly though, too much freedom is a bad thing ( for example the k ). 
Well anyway, I attached the pdf which has a few missing letters still.
Sorry for not making proper sentences with spaces but I just cannot find an easy way to get my illustrator made characters into an easy to use font file. Will learn soon :) Also I may leave this font to settle down in my head for a moment, try some other style in the meantime.
Thanks for looking.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about. What I really want is for more people to come here and comment on this. I&rsquo;m afraid that if I make any mistakes here, it all falls down on you, and keep in mind that I haven&rsquo;t done any expert studies into type design&ndash;I just go by what looks good, and I&rsquo;m self-taught (though by looking at fonts drawn by the experts)&ndash;and I&rsquo;m still just 17, so there&rsquo;s that. All that said, with this larger sample I think I get a better idea of what you&rsquo;re trying to do, and it gives some of your decisions a rationale. The s doesn&rsquo;t actually look as bad as I thought (though it still needs something), and in regards to it working better when rotated 180°, one could say that about Weiss&rsquo;s s too, but then it loses the charm. I think the tail of the g does need to come right at least a little, and I stand by what I said about the flaring in the w,v,y. Also the f is out of character&ndash;too Baskerville. Centaur could be a good inspiration for some of the font. I look forward to whatever else you come up with as you take a sabbatical from Agnoti. I also wish someone <!-- raw HTML omitted -->else<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would come over here and look this over.</div>

Sebilar, I will try that. It certainly isnt something I did intentionally. The k will be revamped, but later on.</p>
<p>Im not sure if this project merits a new thread, so Ill just post it here for the moment. Im working on the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; uniquely. I must have drawn over 200 &ldquo;a&rdquo;&rsquo;s in my sketchbook over the past months. I was wondering if anyone also attempted the experiment among you? Its quite a challenge to come up with an original idea when you hit the the 100&rsquo;s :)
Im working on vectorising them all now, and plan to make many more for perhaps a greater project, who knows, its too early to say. These are by far not the best of the growing collection but the first 18.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good evening everyone.</p>
<p>I have gone onto learning FontLab Studio. I did a quick typeset ( which took about 3 hours to do) and used it as my no risk try every button study. Its great when you see your very own characters appear as you&rsquo;re typing them for the first time.
So here is my first try with the software, the font has a huge number of errors, its ugly in most parts and isnt easy to read but I will clean it up over time. It may turn out to be just for titles or something. Is it ok if I use the same thread? It is based on my old 5 letter logo.

<p>So this evening, I added my agnoti characters in, did some kerning and just gave it a try. Work in progress, but its getting there.
