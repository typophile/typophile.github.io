  body: "This design is like Vilna-Poster. It was first popilarized by LetraSet, as
    peel-down lettering, and later made into a font by FontWorld (www.FontWorld.com)
    and others.\r\n\r\nAs a font for tatoo on skin, the thin strokes might not appear
    clear, or rub away partially over time.\r\n\r\nI created this as the thinner strokes
    are more distinguished, and somewhat more thicker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yonaton_4342.jpg]"

  body: thanks gohebrew! i appreciate it! thanks for pointing the thin strokes out,
    and i have to agree with you! i read somewhere that hebrew in the bible was read
    top to bottom and right to left, is that true? can i rearrange your design to
    spell downand the most important question i think is... did i spell jonathan correctly?
    hehehe! thaks for taking time mate!

  body: "English, like Hebrew, is read top to bottom.\r\nBut first, we read English
    from left to right,\r\nand read Hebrew from right to left.\r\n\r\nSo, the order
    for English is first\r\nleft to right,  and then\r\ntop to bottom, or the next
    line under it,  and then\r\nto the very left of the line to the extreme right,
    \ and so on.\r\n\r\nSo, the order for Hebrew is first\r\nright to left,  and then\r\ntop
    to bottom, or the next line under it,  and then\r\nto the very right of the line
    to the extreme left,  and so on.\r\n\r\nI believe Japanese is as you describe,\r\nfirst
    top to bottom, to the very bottom of the line,  and then\r\nright to left,  to
    the next line on the top,  and then\r\ntop to bottom, to the very bottom of the
    line,  and then\r\nright to left,  to the next line on the top, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe
    order of the letters of your name is spelled correctly.\r\nBut Hebrew names are
    usually spelled from right to left.\r\n\r\nFor design or 'coolness', a name can
    be spelled in a curve.\r\n"

  body: "Some software can position the letters around the top part of a curve or
    semi-circle. Then, you make a PDF file or a .JPG file, and a tatoo is made from
    that.\r\n\r\nHere is an example, using Adobe InDesign.\r\n\r\nThe text can wrap
    around an invisible object, or around a visible object, like a soccer ball, or
    violin, on the left, or the right etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/curved_type_5681.jpg]"
