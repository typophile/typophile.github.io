body: "I've recently tested the Underline position + Line Thickness that you can set
  in the Basic Font Dimensions of the Font Info. I generated an OTF font, which I
  tested in InDesign CS5 with success. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t seem to work
  in Microsoft Word Mac 2011. When I select the Underline option I get a very thin
  line, close to the baseline (default setting). Changing the position and thickness
  directly in Word doesn\u2019t seem to be possible.\r\n\r\nCan someone explain me
  why my custom settings for the Underline in FLS don\u2019t work in Microsoft Word?
  Thanks in advance for your technical feedback."
