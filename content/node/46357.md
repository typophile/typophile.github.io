  by the Scottish Rugby Union on the backs of their shirts.  It looks like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/610x_4136.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/77221311_3662.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/77221351_5726.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/77221362_6001.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/81487469_4249.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/81523593_6363.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the big pictures, but you get what I'm looking for....\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be much appreciated\r\n"
