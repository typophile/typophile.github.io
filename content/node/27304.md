body: I've been browsing through Unstuck by Yamashita and Spataro, and I'm falling
  in love with this lowercase g I'm looking at. Problem is, I can't figure out what
  the face is. I took a screenshot from the amazon preview they have online... any
  help?

  body: Those descenders look cut off in your preview for some reason, just checked
    the book and they are fine in print. But Patty is right, it's Interstate.
