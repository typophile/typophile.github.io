  the subject, I was wondering whether somebody might recommend a good specimen book
  for american poster typography covering the era from around 1840-1900. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  am especially interested in the kinds of ornaments that have been used. So far however,
  I have mostly seen remakes of the style and am now wondering what really rolled
  of the presses back then.\r\n\r\nAny input much appreciated. "

    quality of the days of yore. While my budget on this does not allow me to purchase
    the collections, the gallery images still make a great guide.\r\n\r\nChris: have
    checked out the museum site. While it has very little information in itself, I
    have sent some mail to the proprietors and hope they might be able to guide me
    on. The search term \"wood type\" however has turned out to be pure gold. Much
    thanks!"

    files and then they really slow down your computer (or at least my computer\u2014a
    couple of years old macbook pro) but the <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22Type%20and%20type-founding%22\">internet
    archive</a> has some fantastic typeface resources.  They have scans of a whole
    bunch of original type catalogs (the resolution is low, but tolerable) and manuals
    and stuff.  I'm sure you could find original wood type sources there.  \r\n\r\nFor
    example, you might try \"<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/specimenbookcata00inlauoft\">Specimen
    book and catalog; a price list of printers' supplies, showing types and rules
    in which are embodied all the latest ideas that enable the printer to produce
    superior work</a>\" from the Inland type foundry, St. Louis, 1897.\r\n\r\nI haven't
    downloaded that one, but I did download an 1895 <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/cataloguebookofs00clevrich\">Cleveland
    Type Foundry book of specimens</a> which has a wood type section with some ornaments
    including those I've uploaded.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cleveland_4087.png]"
