  body: "Thanks for the feedback, will definately look into those fonts anyone else
    have any other ideas?\r\n\r\nI feel that the interstate suggestion was right on
    the spot, definately feels based on that font, also for the metro logo I'm going
    with Agenda. SKANSKA was pretty close to Handel Gothic but I'm not 100% on the
    Avant Garde suggestion, it may well be a very customized font but hopefully I
    can find something a bit closer even though you are on the right track.\r\n\r\nI
    much appriciate your efforts, you've been to great help, thank you"

  body: For Nordea, check out Chalet from House Industries. It could be a mash-up
    of the various styles. The "ea" in particular look like the NineteenSeventy style.
    although the others may have been grabbed from NineteenSixty.

  body: 'I take back my Avant Garde guess. There is more evidence that Nordea is drawn
    from scratch: the strokes are even, suggesting that it isn''t merely a [[squoosh|stretched]]
    version of a geometric typeface like AG or Chalet.'
