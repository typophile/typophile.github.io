    oldstyle numerals you have in your sample)  :)\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/notes-soft/]]\r\n\r\nIt
    only matches your top (I think, can't really tell) and middle samples, though.
    The bottom one is something else."

  body: The small cap 'I' is actually without serifs, but I think Florian is right
    that they chopped them off the capital 'I'. Here's the entire <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/primetype/ptl_notes_soft_bundle_ot/?sample_text=PUBLIC%20public%20123&sample_size=36">PTL
    Notes Soft family</a> with all the variations.
