  as you can get) and I was curious about these three typefaces.\r\n\r\nI've always
  used Book Antiqua on other forums when its available, but only recently have I noticed
  thats it's a knockoff of Paltino. I also just became aware of Zapfino, which, after
  doing some research, plenty of blogs say NOT to use it, and its overly used.\r\n\r\nI
  am doing a project for my college class and we're instructed to choose a typeface
  with history, and to convey its history through as much type and as litle imagery
  as possible.  I'd like to do Zapfino since it has the hitory of being in a notebook
  from the 1940s, and kind of \"reserrurceted.\"\r\n\r\nWhat do the experts think?
  Thanks guys/gals!"

    Choose the one that will intrigue you the most-you`ll stay more interested in
    the project. \r\nPersonally, I would go with Zapfino :)"
