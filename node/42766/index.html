  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi

I define my html headings and headers using:
font-family: "Arial Narrow", "Helvetica Narrow", Arial, Helvetica,
sans-serif

However, according to the screen captures I've done at
browsershots.org Linux machines display this using very wide metrics
indeed, to the extent that the number of characters per line on a
Linux machine is roughly half the number of characters per line
displayed on Windows and Mac machines when viewing the same web page.

Is there a reasonably narrow headline (sans serif) font that comes as
standard with Linux which I could use as a substitute for Arial Narrow/
Helvetica Narrow?

Dave

PS - I've noticed that Wikipedia uses a reasonably narrow font for
their main article headings, but (a) I can't work out what font-family
they are using (their css files are a labyrinth and I can't make sense
of them); and (b) I can't test how their headings look under Linux (I
use Windows), because Wikipedia has blocked browsershots.org using a
robots.txt file.

		<div class="commentbody">Re. Thomas's post, how should I define the font-family in the css file in order to get the condensed Vera, DejaVu or Nimbus fonts to display? E.g. does one write:

Re. dii's post, it depends what you mean by "work properly" - I have defined the font family of my heading and header styles to display Arial or Helvetica if Arial Narrow and Helvetica Narrow are both not present, so it will work properly to an extent on any machine with any of those four fonts installed. But having said that, if you can think of a narrow sans serif headline font that comes as standard on Windows machines which *don't* have Arial Narrow installed, and if you can think of a narrow sans serif headline font that comes as standard on Mac OS machines which don't have Helvetica Narrow installed, then I would be very grateful for this information.

How did I forget to mention this? I looked at Wikipedia's stylesheets a while ago. I think the font was just set as "sans-serif", which I think is a soft link in some distros to another font, but squooshed so that it was 125% of it's normal width.</div>
