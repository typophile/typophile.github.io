  body: I just read John Man&#39;s <i>The Gutenberg Revolution</i>, and loved it!
    <BR> <BR>Is <i>Politics and Script</i> any good? I&#39;m really interested in
    that topic.

  body: 'I haven&#39;t read <i>Politics and Script</i>, but I&#39;ve just read Morison&#39;s
    <i>A Tally of Types</i>, and he&#39;s not the easiest author to read. Maybe in
    a more academic work &#40;<i>Politics and Script</i> is Oxford University Press&#41;
    he holds a more coherent argument, but in <i>A Tally of Types</i> he&#39;s all
    over the place. <BR> <BR>Summary of <i>Politics and Script</i> from psbooks: <BR>The
    central argument of this work is that the development of script &#40;inscriptional,
    calligraphic or typographical&#41; has been the result of changes in religious
    or political environment, of friction between church and state, and of the schism
    between Eastern and Western Christendom. Beginning with alphabetic forms on a
    6th century BC gravestone from Melos, Morison&#39;s commentary on over 180 illustrated
    specimens traces the career of the Graeco-Roman alphabet up to newspaper typefaces
    of the 1950s and also shows how modern typefaces owe more to Greek than Roman
    antecedents.  <BR> <BR>'

    <BR>Really, when Morison tries to address anything cultural &#40;beyond his island&#41;
    it&#39;s pretty hopeless. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
