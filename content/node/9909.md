  body: Here is a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/snap-itc/snap-itc/testdrive.html?s=Soi&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Test Drive</a> at MyFonts with these letters. Looks like the letters
    were squeezed/stretched vertically, with more to make the l.c. letters the same
    height. I don&#39;t know if the roughness is from a crummy scan, but noise could
    also be added.
