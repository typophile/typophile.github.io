  have to say..this is a very nice site and I can see it becoming a valuable resource
  for me..Kudos all around.\r\n\r\nSo I'm working on a project for Macy's and need
  to recreate the Calphalon logo, because as usual, they cant get me a vector copy.
  I need to figure out what the font is.\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated\r\n\r\n[[http://www.milners.com.au/cache/images/1/190x100/calphalon_logo.gif|Here
