  cards printed. The computer I used at school is broken and the others in the lab
  don't seem to have this font on it as far as I can tell. \r\nWhat the Font?! and
  Identifont cant tell me what it is, and I've converted my vector formats into outlines
  and forgot to write the name down...I know I'm dumb! I don't need people reiterating
  that fact. Here's a link to the picture if it doesn't attach correctly.\r\n\r\nhttp://i52.tinypic.com/2wnbtbl.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks!
