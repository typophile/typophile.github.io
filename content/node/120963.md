  body: "Very similar to Futura (both are geometric sans serifs) but the R on these
    posters has a leg that connects to the bowl further to the right than it does
    on Futura.\r\n\r\nThese posters have been discussed on this forum before, but
    I can't put my hands on the previous post (and I'm not sure if there was a definitive
    ID)....\r\n\r\n"

  body: '[[http://www.typophile.com/node/119029|Here]] Kevin (although thought I had
    contributed to one discussion on this specific topic). Some letters look too close
    to Futura (like /S) not to be it. Some others not all like /R and /C. Thought
    about [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/verlag/overview|Verlag]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque|Brandon
    Grotesque]], Avenir. On some [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/574168|other
    samples]], the font looks even softly rounded and the top line ''2010 GUIDE TO
    MANHATTAN'' looks definitely like Futura. Original? Tweaked by the designer? To
    what point? I''m not even sure he used the same font for all posters.'

  body: "Ryuk, that's the best suggestion I've heard so far. \r\n\r\nThe designers
    of the poster are Swedish and Hurme is by a Finnish foundry, so maybe they kept
    it in the Scandinavian family....."

  body: "Thanks Kevin. Found another [[http://www.typophile.com/node/88215|one]] but
    from 2011 and so 2 years before the release date of Hurme. [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/538259|On
    this sample]] /R leg looks even different from everything I could guess with these
    samples.\r\nI know what you mean by a potential Scandinivian connection even if
    from my modest identifier experience, the connection between Scandinavians is
    more often strictly limited to the designer's own country. That of course does
    not mean it's not Hurme and I'm not completely wrong about this assumption."
