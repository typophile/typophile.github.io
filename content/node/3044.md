  <BR>&#62; <i>&#40;does Linotype hold the original rights to the face?&#41;</i> <BR>
  <BR>And to confuse things further, Image Club used to have a version &#40;with a
  much more complete character set and superior kerning tables, btw&#41; called <a

  Poster</a>. A scary lawyer letter from Linotype made us license the Ashley Crawford
