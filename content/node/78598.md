body: "Hi everyone, I wonder if anyone knows the primary face used in this cover of
  Mein Kampf. The question was asked on another forum and was never answered. The
  asker mentioned that the cover is a reproduction and that the face is probably available
  digitized. I'm specifically interested in the black letter face used for the styling
  of \"Mein Kampf\" in particular. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/302778/\">Here</a>
  is the original post.\r\n\r\nAnd <a href=\"http://myfonts-wtf.s3.amazonaws.com/73/7317d38ba92eef99d598b599630b69dc.142799.png\">Here
  is a link</a> to the image, which I am posting below as well.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7317d38ba92eef99d598b599630b69dc_5373.142799.png]"

    a reprinted scan of an original book.\r\nSimilar blackletter faces are Element,
    Tannenberg and Gotenburg."
