  remarkable piece among other delicacies on [[http://vau-ef-be.beepworld.de/galerie2.htm|Bernhard
  Schnelle\u2019s site.]], where also a lowercase variant is to be seen.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  helping with a codepoint or some further insights about this character \u2013?\r\n\r\n;-)"

    else\", I meant it was a crazy-looking letter, not that it wasn't an eng.  Sorry
    for any confusion."
