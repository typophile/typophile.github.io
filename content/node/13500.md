  body: The "total lack of consistency" is partially due to the fact that the NYC
    subway system began life as three separate private rail lines. IRT (Interborough
    Rapid Transit) IND (Independent Subway Lines) and BMT (Brookly and Manhattan Transit).
    The different lines are built on different guage track, so all trains cannot run
    on all lines. Long time residents still refer to the different lines by those
    designations, and while I believe there is certainly room for improvement in the
    signage and wayfinding of the system, I would hate for it to lose some of its
    "less than consistent" identity.

  body: "My feeling about the NYC transport signs is in agreement with both John Berry's
    review in Chris's link, and James Montalbano's comments, above. \r\n\r\nI agree
    with Berry that the main problem is not the way finding of the map and guide signs,
    but the internal station signs. But the look of the way-finding (Helvetica and
    Akzidenz Grotesk) is tired, and could benefit from a general update. \r\n\r\nWhat
    upset me was to see newly installed internal station signs that are obviously
    by somebody who knows nothing about letters, and are awkward and ugly.\r\n\r\nAs
    to consistency, I agree with James that this is not so important as concerns the
    internal signs. What is important is that they are easy to see and look good,
    which is not always the case now. Many are in digraceful disrepair also. There
    could be different styles on different lines, for example. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion
    I have is that NYC could commission different foundries to do the internal station
    signs for different lines, with consistent guidelines as to size and location.
    There is a lot of talent out there, and this could come up with varied, good looks.
    \r\n\r\nI lived in London for five years, and to me perhaps no typeface is so
    \ much a part of a city as Johnston's Underground sans, used throughout the London
    Underground. Its plain but personal letters are like an old friend when you travel
    the 'Tube.' (I write as the horror of terror attacks in the Underground is reported.
    Heartbreaking.)\r\n\r\nJust because of the disrepair of many of the station signs,
    there is plenty of reason to rethink the signage for the whole system. \r\n\r\nThe
    other big thing is the New York bus system. London seems to have redone the guide
    signs at the bus stops, and it is really first rate. In New York, there seems
    to be nothing on the bus stops, so that only locals can use them, and then have
    to work to figure out the system. The busses really do need a new way finding
    system.   \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n "

    have said it better myself. :) James brings up some very good points and it is
    something that I had to come to grips with when I was trying to redesign the system.
    Familiarity is something that shouldn't necessarily be broken when restructuring
    a system. I went completely out-there when I first started working on this project,
    but towards the end I realized what did work and kept many of the strong ideas
    Vignelli originated. Here's what I found didn't work:\r\n\r\n1) The phrasing on
    the signs is not consistent nor is it always clearly articulated\r\n2) The signs
    themselves lack crucial information needed to make split second decisions when
    arriving at platforms\r\n3) The background color creates an undesirable mood in
    an underground environment\r\n4) The typography is too large for the sign positioning
    and the rider's actual proximity to the words displayed\r\n5) Chris brought up
    a good point in that the Station Identification signs are completely inconsistent,
    they also are not clearly marked or positioned properly to the height of the windows
    in subway cars.\r\n6) Same number or line designations (A, 7, 6) that follow DIFFERENT
    train paths\r\n\r\nWhile I have made an attempt to correct those issues as I saw
    them, I'm not going to say that I made the end all be all solution to these problems.
    BTW, if someone can tell me how to post jpgs here, I'd be more than happy to show
    my solution to the Station Identification problem.\r\n\r\nYes, the subway uses
    Akzidenz-Grotesk (originally) and Helvetica. Vignelli originally chose Akzidenz-Grotesk
    and chose the type to be shown in negative rather than positive contrast. There
    are still remnants of some of these signs in various stations around the city.
    For whatever reason the MTA switched later to Helvetica and made the signs black
    with white type. I do think that the decision to go with positive rather than
    negative contrast was a change for the better."

    I have seen Helvetica Condensed, Akzidenz and even Copperplate Gothic printed

  body: "\"How does something like this even begin to get off the ground?\" \r\n\r\nThe
    question I've been asking myself for over a year. I also have to disagree David.
    The things you mentioned are not set in stone. Those changes have nothing to do
    with:\r\n1) Sign placement\r\n2) Navigational symbols\r\n3) Legibility\r\n\r\nAll
    of which CAN be improved upon. Paris is undergoing these changes as we speak.
    London, Paris and New York's subway systems were all created within around 10
    years of each other. Also, London's system is actually OLDER than New York's.
    If you have seen their transportation systems up close before, you would see there
    is no comparison as to who the winner is in regards to system upkeep. Additionally,
    if we want to discuss system complexity and wayfinding, Paris' system trumps New
    York's in regards to the number of daily subway riders annually. Add all these
    factors up and there is really no excuse for New York's system to be deteriorating
    the way it is.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to point something out to some non-New York
    residents. The mayor has absolutely NO control of the MTA. The MTA is operated
    by the Port Authority of New York, which is run by the state, not the city. The
    man ultimately in charge is Governor Pataki, not  Mayor Bloomberg. This is part
    of the problem. Bloomberg made a play earlier in his term to gain control over
    the MTA. Unfortunately, the plan fell through. This is why some of you may have
    been hearing about fund distribution problems in regards to Homeland Security
    money. The money that is given to the city for transit security is allocated by
    the state, not the city government. Too many hands having to pass the buck ultimately
    loses a few. "

  body: The problem with transit statistics is that they often just record "rail records."
    This can be underground, cable, or elevated rail for example. Boston for example,
    has a combination of these, as does New York. Separating these elements which
    are components of a larger system doesn't seem to make sense to me when we are
    discussing "mass transit" or subway systems. The name of the Subway certainly
    doesn't change when I go over the Manhattan Bridge.

    this sort of matter and I'm sure what he states has a large degree of truth. \r\n\r\nStill,
    it is certainly a dream of mine to be involved in a mass transit wayfinding project
    and I would hope to someday help fix New York's problem. Given the many unreturned
    phone calls and even being \"stood-up\" for an appointment (with no call-back)
    it is becoming increasingly apparent that the MTA has a lot of people working
    for them that frankly, \"just don't give a sh*t\".\r\n\r\nWhile I respect native
    New Yorkers opinions, I have noticed many inner-city political issues becoming
    stagnant based on some natives' reluctancy for change. This city is supposed to
    be one of the most liberal, yet at times it seems stuck in the past and not wanting
    to move forward...the most common complaint I have heard is about \"convenience\".
    Plenty of New Yorkers don't want to be inconvenienced (main complaint of the 2012
    Olympics). the economy is having hard times here and I don't see why the city
    and state government don't see 2 crucial elements that can drive more money and

    cleaned up the graffitti, turned midtown into a suburban mall, as well as shipping
    all the homeless to points unknown. (they're back) Whatever money the MTA has
    spent restoring the system came about from the public rejection of the collapsing
    subway system. Less ridership, less revenue. The improvements all came about because
    of economic pressure from the city's business sector to have a fuctioning subway
    system, not becuase of aestheics. The fact that Gov. Pataki holds the purse string
    on the MTA is significant. Albany has not increased its allocation to the subway
    (most of the funds  to support and improve suburban rail lines). To finance the
    subway improvements has meant the MTA has borrowed too much, and almost all of
    its budget for the forseeable future will go to paying off the debt. Not much
    left for anything else. You can already feel the decay of the subways beginning
