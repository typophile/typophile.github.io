  body: First post and first face.  Welcome! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m afraid the page doesn&#39;t
    exist. Also if you link to a zip it would be usefgul to know what kind of file
    we can expect upon unzipping. <BR> <BR>Can you post a gif in your message perhaps?
    Attach a PDF maybe? <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: It downloaded fine for me.  It is an OTF. <BR>It might be better to upload
    PDFs instead of giving away your font Yeah.

  body: Thank you for quick reactions. <BR> <BR>Netscape&#39;s Mywebpage section sometimes
    has difficulties, please try again later, it should work. There&#39;s a web page
    too at the same location. <BR> <BR><a href="http://mywebpage.netscape.com/yeahnoah/index.html"
    target="_blank">http://mywebpage.netscape.com/yeahnoah/index.html</a> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    planning to give away this font, just like my Type 1 font editor application,
    Noah&#40;TM&#41;. I&#39;d like to make a Type 1 version as well, but the number
    of kernpairs must be slightly reduced first.

  body: The links aren&#39;t working for me, but anyway I -as well as many others
    I suspect- would like to avoid the hassle of unzipping, installing, etc. So if
    you could put up a PDF, or even just a [large] bitmap rendering that would be
    great. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: the S is a bit top heavy, the B is too shy/narrow. the E too wide. i think
    generally the optical height isn&#39;t well adjusted yet. look at the word DESCENDER
    - the E letters appear to be heavier than the others.  <BR>i like the lowercase
    better than the capitals. s is also a bit top heavy and leaning backwards. <BR>
    <BR>is &#34;yeah&#34; your real name?  <BR>and welcome to typophile.

  body: didn&#39;t know you where from hungary ... :-&#41; <BR> <BR>on the pdf you
    can see it very clearly, that your S isn&#39;t high enough. it has to go below
    the baseline and above the x-height to appear optically correct.

  body: Please note that what you see in PDF is actually the embedded font rendered
    by your OS font subsystem, subject to hinting. Zooming in will reveal those overshoots
    &#40;which I had to decrease because S seemed too large compared to E&#41;.
