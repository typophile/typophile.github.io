    struck me as unusual, so I am sure I would never have known where to look. Is
    this a popular font?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n"

    upper terminals /W. I know it very well as I''m using it a lot for web purpose
    ([[http://www.lokoodreams.com|here]] for instance). I like its cleanness, legibility/readability,
    large range and subtle impact. It is somehow a free alternative to Gotham. '

  body: "Thanks Ryuk. Since posting my comment I looked into Raleway and found it
    was a Google Font.  I have failed to look into these fonts before and found about
    140 serif fonts that might need to be added to my Guide. I saw some familiar fonts,
    and a few that seemed like renames of existing designs (not cool!), but also a
    lot that seemed original. \r\n\r\nHas there been any discussion of the merits/demerits
    of the Google Fonts?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
