  body: it will much meaningful if you take the letters from a word, like /g, /o,
    and /d or /s, /e, and /x

  body: "Meaning doesn't seem relevant to me in this case, however I do like the notion
    of using full words as a way to project an identity onto the designs. Like, you
    could entitle these \"god\", \"sex\" etc. rather than using arbitrary titles.\r\n\r\nThe
    series would probably get meaning by doing it over and over again, and the series
    wouldn't be particularly interesting until it's a big collection. If I were to
    do that, than certainly it seems a smart idea to use words rather than arbitrary
    letters.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Veer published some lovely typographic \u201Cscreensavers\u201D
    15 years ago.</blockquote>\r\nThat's interesting, because I made a consideration
    of whether I should continue this series considering that technically these designs
    are not impressive at all right now. They would have been far more impressive
    15 years ago. But as I said, this series could become interesting with quantity."
