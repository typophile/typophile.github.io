  in an interview he says he does his pencil drawings on tracing paper and then scans
  them. I was also looking at photos of what I think was a workshop run by Ale Paul
  and again everyone seemed to be drawing on tracing paper. What are the advantages
  of this? I'm guessing you can lay a grid under the paper without needing to draw
  and then erase them on the paper. Also being able to see your design in reverse.
  Is there something else that I'm missing? I use tracing paper only rarely and that
  is purely for tracing.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was at art school in the late '80s my course
  was fine art and there weren't any design courses where I might have learnt about
  such techniques."

    on what you already have.

    tracing paper) stands up to significantly more erasure than ordinary paper. \r\n\r\n"

  body: What eliason and russellm said. I know of graphic designers and illustrators
    who use tracing paper as well.

  body: 'Thanks everyone. I hadn''t thought about the durabilty, but that''s a good
    point Kent. I realise it is good for revising drawings later on, which is where
    I use it, but I thought there might have been a specific reason for doing a first
    draft on tracing paper rather than something more opaque. '
