  Arial Unicode? I am trying to produce a multi-language toolkit for a channel brand
  and i need arial unicode both in regular and bold but after i bought it online (thinking
  it was a family) it only had one weight....\r\n\r\nAny help gratefully received,\r\n\r\nJohn"

  body: "For regular multi-language work -- French, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish,
    Danish, and a couple of other Western European languages, you only need a handful
    of accented characters. These appear in the majority of \"serious\" fonts -- we're
    talking Windows Western mapping here, \"\xE4\", \"\xE9\", \"\xF1\", \"\xFE\" and
    the like. Let's not mention the Microsoft invention \"\xFF\" :-)\r\n\r\nPlain
    Arial (the one that comes for free with Windows, in Regular Italic, Bold, and
    Bold Italic) has an extended character set, supporting Central-European languages,
    with characters such as \"\u0142\", \"\u0157\", \"\u014D\" (Polish, Slowak, Lithuanian
    -- anything not Cyrillic), but <em>also</em> Greek (kathaverousa, not polytonic),
    Cyrillic, Turkish, Hebrew, and a smattering of Arabic -- of this last one, I'm
    not sure if it supports everything completely, i.e., with all initial, medial,
    and final forms.\r\n\r\nIf <em>that</em> is still not enough for your multilingual
    needs, Arial Unicode adds characters for Ancient Greek, Japanese, Korean, Georgian
    and a whole lot of others, but surely you are not looking that far, are you? Perhaps
    you should list the languages (scripts) that you're interested in."

    Arabic and Hebrew. And it comes in reg, bold, italic, bold italic. \r\n\r\nArial
    Unicode is really a fall-back font. I don't think it should be considered for
    brand use. However if you really want to use it you might want to contact Ascender
    or Monotype to see if they can produce a bold style for you.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "An additional thought -- awaiting John's (hopefully) long list of wanted
    scripts -- is that, if a certain script can <em>not</em> be found in bog standard
    Arial, it's most likely one of the more pictoral ones as found in the Far East
    (Hangul, Mongolian, Devanagari, Thai) or new orthographies (Cree comes to mind,
    although I don't know why).\r\n\r\nIt's a tall order to find a single font family
    for all these different writing systems. He'd better settle for \"a sort of sans
    look, but if there isn't one, no worries.\"\r\n\r\nIs this brand to target all
    of Western, Mongolian, Chinese and minority Aboriginal dialects? It must be the
    hottest thing since the iPod, then! How about calling it \"\u5323\u78EC  ( xi\xE1
    q\xECng q\u01D0ng)\", \"little music box\"?"

  body: "I can't speak for the other scripts, but the hangul (Korean alphabet) component
    of Arial Unicode should absolutely not be used in any work where it is assumed
    that it will be seen by people who read Korean. I've said this before, but it
    is an atrocity. If the need ever arises for a typeface for setting Korean, use
    any of the hangul-dedicated system fonts that are widely bundled (okay, maybe
    avoid Gulim, but Dotum, Apple Gothic, etc. are great) but never Arial Unicode.\r\n\r\nBesides,
    these days Arial Unicode hangul is cropping up everywhere on the web on awkwardly
    'localized' websites and banner ads complete with bad machine translations into
    Korean. Not a pleasant experience from a design point of view for the Korean web
    surfer."

  body: "Arial Unicode is indeed a fall-back font. But you can use it along with normal
    Arial Bold and normal Arial italic if you want.\r\n\r\nWindows Vista has five
    font families with a very large number of characters, almost every character in
    Unicode 5.0 found in the Latin character set.\r\n\r\nBut for free fonts or low-cost
    fonts, look in http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts.html . The subsection \u201CLarge
    fonts\u201D contains a number of fonts with many, many characters, though a lot
    of these don\u2019t contain bold and italic versions.\r\n\r\nA good choice is
    the DejaVu family available at http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
    . Note that the fonts with LCG in their names are versions with contain only the
    Latin, Cyrillic and Greek character sets so you probably won\u2019t want these.
    The regular versions also contain Hebrew, Arabic, and other goodies. The standard
    sans-serif also contains a lot of math symbols and pictures and so forth that
    normally would not be required in bold or italic versions. This font family is
    upgraded regularly.\r\n\r\nAs to Thomas de Jong\u2019s quip: \u2018Let\u2019s
    not mention the Microsoft invention \u201C\xFF\u201D\u2019 \u2014 this character
    is part of the ISO Latin 1 alphabet, and its inclusion in that character set has
    nothing whatosever to do with Microsoft. The character \u201C\xFF\u201D appears
    (though rarely) in French names, including some place names: Pierre Lou\xFFs,
    Le Blanc de Nicola\xFF, rue des Clo\xFFs, L\u2019Ha\xFF les Roses, A\xFF, Mo\xFF
    and so was sensibly and rightly included in the set.\r\n\r\nIt does not have an
    uppercase counterpart in the Latin 1 alphabet, because, at the time the Latin
    1 alphabet was being created, it was generally thought to incorrect in French
    to normally place diacritics on capital letters. Since the committee involved
    was very pressed for space in creating this character set, it made perfect sense
    to omit \u201C\u0178\u201D, as a character that could not exist in the scripts
    the Latin 1 set covered (ignoring Quebec French where omitting diacritics from
    capital letters was considered incorrect).\r\n\r\nOf course, nowadays it is usually
    considered incorrect to omit diacritics on capitals in French. And the Microsoft
    variant of the Latin 1 aphabet adds the missing \u201C\u0178\u201D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    bungle-up anecdotes! Oh well, it was hear-say after all.\r\n\r\nAll jokes asides,
    it still appears to me the OP (John) has overrated the importance of Arial Unicode,
    versus just about any serious font. I know <em>I</em> wouldn't use it for anything
    but a last resort to finally insert that obscure mathematical character I was
    looking for, or as a handy repository for all kinds of dingbats.\r\n\r\nMy line
    of work is heavily geared towards multilingual typesetting, and, while the main
    bulk of text is in English or French, I've encountered snippets in more languages
    than I care to remember. My bread-and-butter font for just about all of them is
    Minion Pro, with a tasty side dish of hugely specialized characters for phonetics
    and accents, which my colleagues and me created in the semblance of that same
    Minion. For CJK I use the set of fonts that came with CS3, which are all drawn
    lovingly and carefully.\r\n\r\nThe only ones I really miss in my <em>r\xE9pertoire</em>
    are the RTL languages -- specifically Hebrew and Arabic, since standard IDCS <em>still</em>
    does not support them natively, and I don't trust Word to do my shopping list
    with, let alone my typesetting."
