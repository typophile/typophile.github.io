  is chosen (investment consultancy), now I just need to get the word (trading) right.
  It was added at the last moment.\r\nThe guys want the word trading to be placed
  aligned below the main word, but I feel it can breathe more if it s pushed further
  right. They are also quite conservative about the font (trading). Do you think it
  s fine If I just stick with another Helvetica for trading? I have to admit I am
  still learning about typo, so don t know what to fight for. Still my instinct says,
  it s a bit boring to have both words in Helvetica :)\r\n\r\nBtw. what do you think
  of the colour? They wanted red although it s not v common in investments. I feel
  that at least it s distinguishing them from the competition (theya re all blue or
  green).\r\n\r\nThanx for your opinions!\r\n\r\nK.\r\n"

    further. Serifs don't pair well at all.

    body: "Hi, thank you for your comment. You mean the choice of serifs dont pair
      or you think generally don t pair by our opinion? I don t want to fight over
      the topic, but the least I know serfis pair with Helvetica and make it more
      interesting, do some contrast. And this selection are fonts selected by Indra
      Kupferschmidt, (german typographer) and by other people from Typophile. \r\n\r\nYou
      didn t give me a reason why you think they don t pair. I am not figthing, just
      trying to find answers. Well I would say some of them pair better, some of them
      less, and I wanted to help with picking the one. \r\n\r\nThank you for your
      answer anyway. \r\nK."

  body: "I meant this particular case of course. The pairing is typically meant for
    printed material with a lot of text. When you have just two words in a wordmark,
    it's an entirely different matter. There's no volume to get a general feel of
    the typeface, there are just individual glyphs. \r\n\r\nThe reason they don't
    pair, in my opinion, is that there's just no visual consistency or relevancy between
    two lines. It's not a contrast, it's a complete dissonance. It's like trying to
    pair a banana with a screwdriver. They are great on their own, but they aren't
    related at all.\r\n\r\nConsidering how visually diverse the existing part of the
    logo is, I think your best bet is not to further complicate things and just stick
    to the exact same font as INWIZ. There's already too much going on in the top
    line to add more to it.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I'd try and simplify the top line
    by using a regular-width or a narrow version of the INWIZ sans. This could allow
    for some fancier stuff in the tagline.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFellas? Chip in.\r\n"

  body: All caps sans looks right to me also. At this size I'm not sure the exact
    font matters that much, even with the Helvetica /R/. I am not totally sure about
    the right alignment, but the unaligned ones look worse. Overall it feels pretty
    corporate so Helvetica fits in that sense. Nice work so far.

  body: Some good comments here, I would say it would be between the top right one,
    and the 2nd down right one.  I would choose the top right one only because to
    me it says movement which is what trading would involve (the movement of money).
    Overall I like your use of type, but agree with others that a  serif font would
    not work well.

  body: "I think you should keep on the same post that originated the whole logo.
    But nevertheless.\r\n\r\n<strong>As said in the other post: Helvetica all caps.</strong>\r\n\r\nI
    don't really care whether Helvetica is overused or not. In your logo of all variants
    you showed it works best. And that's what matters most.\r\n\r\nBut I do have a
    bit \"of a problem\" with your simbol. It should be optically tweaked, because
    the \"up arrow\" or /N/ in it seems to be leaning left. /I/ also seems to be be
    thinner on top the same as the /N/... But apart from that it seems like a very
    nice and professional logo."
