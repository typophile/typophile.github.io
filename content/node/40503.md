  body: The Z appears to be an N turned on its side.

  body: Ditto on the 'N'. That's actually a very lovely set of letters. I don't think
    there's a font equal.

    waisted</a> 'R' is unique. You can get close with [[Gotham]], <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/process/klavika_bold_ot/?sample_text=ANAR&sample_size=74&acs_p=1&acs_pt=24&acs=1\">Klavika</a>

  body: thanks. yeah the 'R' is the most interesting thing to me - besides the 'N'
    of course.

  body: "Ha! Love that N/Z. Hideous in a very folk artish way! The typeface, though,
    seems quite nice. Very Neturafacesque.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the building originally
    housed a company called ANAR, who went bankrupt, and the new tenant figured they'd
    save a few bucks and just based their name of the existing signage. ;o)\r\n\r\n(In
    fact, I know I've seen examples like that...companies moving in to existing building
    and basing their new name on part of the old signage...that'd make for a good
    blog.)"
