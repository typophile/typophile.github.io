  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>i could really use some font suggestions.</p>
<p>i am in search of a stylish, contemporary looking font to be used for small amounts of body copy in a photography monograph.</p>
<p>this font should work well when placed next to another section that is set in Univers Light.</p>
<p>i would like the font to be clearly and instantly read as separate from the paragraphs set in Univers.</p>
<p>this font will possibly replace the garamond face used in the PDF sample attached.</p>
<p>in my mind, i am looking for something like a sturdy but not overbearing slab-serif face - but i could be totally wrong about that and i&rsquo;m willing to consider anything at this point.</p>
<p>unfortunately, the client don&rsquo;t have much of a budget, so whatever it is, it should be inexpensive or free (or perhaps something that i already own that i might have overlooked!)  i know, that is a lame requirement and i am embarrassed to have to mention it, but what can you do???</p>
<p>thanks for any help!!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">If you want to go with slab serif, I&rsquo;d suggest something with a larger x-height like

<p>ideally, i am looking for something a little more contemporary looking.  it certainly doesn&rsquo;t have to be a slab-serif font.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you want a contemporary slab serif, try Serifa or PMN Caecilia &ndash; the latter seems to be popular lately, but I guess I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that as I love it. I&rsquo;ve been using it and TheSans for my own materials (résumé, business cards, etc) lately.</p>
<p>If you want something that is distinctive and will look nice next to Univers, I humbly suggest either Van Dijck or [[Zuzana Licko]]&rsquo;s Filosofia. Van Dijck may be too delicate for what you&rsquo;re trying to do, but Filosofia (or another didone) will match the weight and width of Univers well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i&rsquo;m quite fond of PMN Caecilia as well, and it was one of the first fonts that i tried!  unfortunately, it feels a little too &ldquo;light&rdquo; or &ldquo;whimsical&rdquo; (for lack of a better word) in this context.</p>
<p>i had also previously used filosofia, but the client seems to prefer garamond instead.</p>
<p>i thought i had finally found the perfect font in reform from psy/ops, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit so well either.</p>
<p>our deadline is quickly approaching and i might just have to settle for the garamond/univers combo.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, the whole reason I chose PMN Caecilia was because it was like Clarendon, only more &ldquo;boring&rdquo;. I like things that are &ldquo;boring&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m a photographer myself, and call what I do taking &ldquo;boring pictures of nothing&rdquo;, which is of course mildly disingenous, but I&rsquo;ve never found a better name for what I do. In this case, &ldquo;boring&rdquo; means &ldquo;businesslike&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m surprised it turned out to be too whimsical, but I suppose I can see what you mean.</p>
<p>You may already be stuck with Garamond, but on the off chance you aren&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/70242.html?1114510192">thread here about Clarendons</a> (started by yours truly). You may find the faces discussed too quirky for your needs, but it&rsquo;s a pretty good rundown on recent slab serifs. Or you could try Bitstream Charter, which is conservative but squared off and won&rsquo;t clash too badly with Univers. Hmm&hellip;</p>
