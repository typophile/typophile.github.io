    after we met at the 40th Bodoni Museum \u2013 I remember I used a long email address,
    not the Reading one, it was printed with a typeface he was developing, I don't
    remember right now, but here is a picture, it was taken by P. De Macchi.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/40mo-Bodoni.jpg]"
