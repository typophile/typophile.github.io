body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to move some fonts (in this case Sabon) over from an
  older Mac onto a Leopard system.\r\n\r\nThe fonts are FFIL/LWFN suitcases and there
  is a separate folder with .AFM metrics files.\r\n\r\nBy just opening the FFIL in
  FontBook, the font seems to install but ligatures don't to work unless I use the
  font in InDesign. (i.e. the fi and fl ligatures are there in the list of glyphs
  but don't get automatically replaced).\r\n\r\nIs there something else I need to
  do to enable the ligatures? I haven't restarted the computer since the install,
  would that help?"

  body: InDesign has special built-in algorithm for basic ligature substitution of
    Type 1 fonts. If your font contain properly encoded ligature fi or fl (maybe other
    ligatures too), it is used in your text. It won't work in any other application
    and it has nothing to do with font management software.
