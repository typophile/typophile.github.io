  articles/battles/&c. in 2006?\r\n\r\nWas there a thread that you found particularly
  insightful? Was there one that began interestingly, but you just simply ignored
  after it descended into flames? Was there one thread that made you split your seams
  with laughter at each succeeding comment? Was there a bit of information that somehow
  saved your hide? Was there one that was just simply too silly to spend time commenting
  on?\r\n\r\nLet's hear your thoughts!"

    from China posted a photo of their cat looking at a photo of my cat on screen.
    That has nothing to do with type but some of my favorite threads are the ones
    that get hijacked into silliness.\r\n\r\nIt's the end of the year and I'm not
    gonna say anything nasty."

    to improve the typeface.\r\n\r\nBest wishes for 2007!\r\n"

    of the year has to be the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/froggy\">'Froggy' critique
    thread</a>--and those that followed it. \r\n\r\nSeeing Chris Lozos come into his
    own as a type designer has been really exciting, and his beautiful spirit has
    been a blessing to us all on Typophile. \r\n\r\nMatthew Carter liked 'Now Sans'
    better at TypeCon 2006, I think, but I'll always have an affection for the Frog
    :) "

    most of the time at typophile going through old threads and trying to follow the
    debates especially those related to the history of type or technical issues. Sometimes
    I just give up, it's simply too much (read difficult) for me but most of the time
    there's something useful and interesting or just plain funny. \r\nOn a personal

    2006</a>.\r\n\r\nDespite my hopes and silent encouragement, Hrant didn't release
    his elegant Baskerville, neither did Raph release his revolutionary tools. Can't
    say I did much myself but, at least it was something I got right.\r\n\r\nHappy

  body: As a guy who thought he knew a lot about type, the primary lesson for me was
    that I have a lot to learn. I am grateful for the education I am receiving and
    for the professional, patient way in which you, my professors, deal with me and
    others. I have seen many wonderful new (and new to me) typefaces. I have to agree
    with those who have stated that seeing typefaces submitted for critique, the comments
    made about them, and the development of the faces is an amazing education. Thanks,
    everybody.
