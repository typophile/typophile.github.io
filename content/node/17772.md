  my possible abusage and misusage of terms.\r\n\r\nWhen reading books that employ
  so called \u2018old style figures\u2019 I often find the 0 (zero) so contrast-less.
  Take for example the font Hoefler Text, of which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mediaevalziffern.png\">Wikipedia</a>
  has an image. This 0 seems so round, I don't think it's perfectly round, but at
  smaller sizes it almost appears so.\r\n\r\nThe 6 and 9 have much stronger contrast,
  also the lowercase o has much more contrast generally (in a serif font). Why doesn't
  the 0 look more like the o? I often tend to perceive the 0 as \u2018the odd one
  out\u2019 when reading for example dates like \u20181609\u2019 in a book.\r\n\r\nAre
  there historical reasons for this shape, or am I seeing things that aren't that
  common at all. :)"

    the stressless zero are blindly following a tradition that has been irrelevant

    sensitive ways to design an oldstyle zero that contrasts with the letter 'o'.\r\n\r\n*

  body: "Using this form does make sense. You indicated why: <cite>I often tend to
    perceive the 0 as \u2018the odd one out\u2019.</cite> I won't use the terrible
    R-word. An alternative approach could be to maintain contrast as found in lowercase
    o, but make the zero a bit lighter and rounder.\r\n\r\nBut the question surprises
    me. With the same argument (the R-word), type designers add a finial to sanserif
    lowercase l and sometimes i, plus serifs to uppercase I. Even in sanserifs, uppercase
    I and lowercase l can be distinguished without the finial as versals tend to be
    smaller and a bit bolder, and sometimes the l's top end differs from the I's anyway.
    Not to forget context. The finial even makes it hard to space these letters well.
    Not to mention that in sanserifs, a serifed I is easily mistaken for a T ... Yet
    this has been widely adopted -- <cite>blindly following a tradition</cite>? ;-)"

  body: The old style 0 has the advangage that it is clearly different from the lower
    case o, which is nearly the same size. 0o--see the difference here in Georgia?
    I think it works--2006--see? In text Georgia is actually stressed, but on screen
    in small sizes it looks to be a ring. Incidentally, the outlines for the ring
    looking 0 are usually not two circles, but ovals with some resultant stress.

  body: "> irrelevant for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe not hundreds. I've
    come to believe that the drastically-different zero was mostly to help not the
    reader, but the distributor of metal type (back into the drawers) to make fewer
    mistakes; this is because when <cite>setting</cite> type (into the stick) you
    do it -nearly- blindly (if you're good). So/but yes, it's been a dumb idea for
    a while now.\r\n\r\n> type designers add a finial to sanserif lowercase\r\n> l
    and sometimes i, plus serifs to uppercase I.\r\n\r\nYeah, but the good designers
    make sure those\r\nfeatures don't stick out like a sore thumb!\r\n\r\n> in sanserifs,
    a serifed I is easily mistaken for a T\r\n\r\nBut clearly far less than all those
    sticks for one-another.\r\n\r\n> the outlines for the ring looking 0 are usually

    they're usually as [apparently] circular as possible.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDon't get
    me wrong, I think that form can be useful sometimes (heck, even <cite>Helvetica</cite>
    can be useful sometimes! :-) and it's possible that a certain designer can sincerely
    justify its continued use today, but almost all the time it is indeed a result
    of psychological lethergy.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
