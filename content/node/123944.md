  It's a broche people get when graduating nurse school in the '60 in Holland. Besides
  my own research, I might need your expertise about similar typeface. But then I
  am looking for a bit more modern looking then this one, but still the same style.\r\n\r\nHope
  to hear back soon,\r\n\r\nR\r\n\r\n"
