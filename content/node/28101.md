  guess its more of an embellishment..? It is popular but i cant place the name of
  the leaf. It's the upside-down heart with a curl on the end and a curly bit on top..this
  thing!\r\nanyone?? i've only found catalogue numbers on 'do it yourself' printing
  sites..[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leafdingbat_5146.jpg]"

    Typographic Style.\" Don't have mine with me, but I'm sure some nice individual
    can check it out for you.\r\n\r\nThen again, as Johnathan suggests, \"fleuron\"
    may well be its sole name."

    body: "i'm so glad I decided to join and ask. This is the kind of keener infostuff
      I was looking for. \r\nBy the By: I started this aft looking at ivy leaves and
      found images and graphics of variegated leaves unlike the fleuron in question.
      It's designer, looking out his window, doing a line drawing for the woodcut
      somewhere in the UK back in the day, must have lived on the top floor of his
      residence: h. helix and h. hibernica have TWO leaf types. They have both palmately
      lobed juvenile leaves [the kind you mostly see in photos] on creeping and climbing
      stems, and UNLOBED cordate adult leaves on fertile flowering stems exposed to
      full sun, usually high in the crowns of trees or the top of rock faces. also
      called lovestone. OK? Thanks!!"
