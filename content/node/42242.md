  of Akzidenz Grotesk for a design class. However, I know diddly squat about the origins
  of this page...perhaps its from an old Berthold book (judging from the body copy)
  or something? I'm looking for the official two-letter abbreviation for Cheltenham
  that would appear where the \"Ak\" is (upper-left corner).\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be appreciated...thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AK_3471.jpg]"

    font's name - like you'd see at the top of a dictionary page for easier thumbing-through
    (\"cil - cla\").\r\n\r\nSo if your Chelt is the first font on the page, I'd use
    Ch."
