body: How the encoding should work for a dingbat font in OpenType, considering Unicode
  and stuff? What's the best way to make it compatible with older programs and different
  OS and languages?

  body: 'I''ve built dingbat fonts that encoded icons in the PUA unicode ranges. To
    make something compatible with dumb programs you could do it the cryptic old-fashioned
    way, putting your dingbats in slots accessible by mac and windows keystrokes and
    making a reference sheet. '

  body: "Yeah, assigning PUA unicode values is probably the most 'correct' way, but
    it's also very common to put them in the upper and lowercase Latin positions.
    I guess it depends if the font will also include an alphabet or not.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UE000.pdf"

  body: Also check and see if the particular dingbats you have happen to match up
    with the appropriate Unicode spaces.  There are some dingbat or dingbat-likes
    in Miscellaneous Technical (2300), Miscellaneous Symbols (2600) and Dingbats (2700)
    and a few other places.
