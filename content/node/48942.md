body: "Ok so here's my dilema. I have to write a ten page research paper for my advanced
  typography class. Mine is on Garamond. The paper is so we will have text to use
  for a book near the end of the semester. The problem with this paper is that it
  is due NEXT WEEK. So yea, I have about 3 days worth of research and then I get one
  day to write it.\r\n\r\nI am having trouble finding stuff on Garamond. (Not Adobe
  Garamond, the font created by Claude Garamond, the French printer.) I spent 2 days
  in our library at school, which is rather large. I only found at most a small paragraph
  in any book. They all said the same things.\r\n\r\nThe topic is not set in stone,
  so if anyone has a font in mind with a rich history, please share! No Helvetica...

    on Garamond you might want to start asking librarians to help with your research.
    Or start going to better libraries!
