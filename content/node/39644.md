  body: "Don't know any such built-in feature. Writing a macro for that would be quite
    easy, however.\r\n\r\nI can think of another, rather weird method: build an MM
    font with the old and the new one as masters. Those that are not compatible will
    not turn green so you have a first indication of modified glyphs. Then, generate
    an instance at an extreme extrapolation, say, 25000. Then you should be able to
    spot the changed glyphs \u2013 they will look strange and messy. I remember having
    done that once."
