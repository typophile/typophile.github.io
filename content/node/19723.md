  like the way the right-hand margin looks with punctuation hanging out a little.
  But I also sometimes get en dashes (with a space on either side marking parentheses)
  that jut out into the left-hand margin. I'm not sure how I feel about this. Is there
  historical - pre-digital - precedence for it? Could you/ would you do it with a
  letter press for example? Interested to hear what people think.\r\n\r\nToby"

    body: "Hi Nick - So I guess my question is just about those dashes. I'm quite
      happy with quotation marks hanging out from the left margin.\r\n\r\nYou wrote:\r\n\r\n>
      But you should never start a line with a dash, if it occurs in the middle of
      a sentence.\r\n\r\nThis is news to me, though not something I'd ever thought
      about until InDesign started sticking them out into the margins and made them
      more noticeable. I've just now had a look at Bringhurst to see if he has anything
      to say on it. I don't think he does, but I did find several examples of lines
      starting with dashes.\r\n\r\nDo other people on the list use this rule? I'd
      think it would be kind of tricky to enforce ...\r\n\r\nLike I say I've only
      noticed it since I started using InDesign. And now I've grown quite used to
      it \u2013 I'm only thinking about it now because a proofreader of a book I'm
      working on brought it up.\r\n"

  body: "I often wish that there was a way to \"tweak\" InDesign's optical margin
    settings. Some punctuation hangs further out than others. Obviously Adobe's made
    some decisions about what they think looks optically correct, but with some of
    the punctuation (in some settings), it seems to hang too far into the margin.
    \r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd be able to set how optically far out each piece of punctuation
    sits -- setting a different global margin adjustment for quote marks than the
    adjustment it uses for a dash."

  body: "I know the rule, and it makes sense if a dash introduces an addition to a
    sentence:\r\n\r\nXXXXX XXXX XXX XXXXXX X XXX\r\nXXX XXX XXXXX XX XXXXX --\r\nXXXXXX
    XXXXX XXX. XXXXX XXX\r\nXXX, XXXXX XXXXX XXX XXXX.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it is
    hard to avoid a dash at the beginning of a line. Despite Tschichold and Bringhurst.\r\n\r\nIn
    case that two dashes contain an inclusion, I'd place the first dash at the beginning
    of a line even if there is some space in the preceding one -- this makes clearer
    that the two dashes are a pair and include something:\r\n\r\nXXXXX XXXX XXX XXXXXX.
    X XXX\r\nXXX XXX XXXXX XX XXXXX XXXX\r\n-- XXXXXX XXXXX X -- XXXXX \r\nXXX XX.
    XXXXX XXXXX XXX XXXX.\r\n\r\n[removed silly suggestion]"

  body: "Our journals use space before and after en-dashes for stylistic reasons,
    and we too ran into the problem of lines beginning with dashes in InDesign.\r\n\r\nWe
    adjusted text production so that we always have non-breaking spaces before en-dashes,
    and that solves the problem nicely.  If you can't do it on the pre-production
    side, a simple InDesign script to replace (space)(your choice of dash) with (nonbreaking
    space)(your choice of dash) should work.\r\n\r\nI know that in Days of Yore, some
    programs would not recognize the nonbreaking space as a \"space\" and not extend
    or contract it for justification or best glyph placement.  I don't believe InDesign
    has ever had that problem."

  body: "There are different rules with different languages. In Finnish the common
    practice is, that en-dash \u2013 marking an addition, quote etc \u2013 should
    be at the start of the line. Otherwise it can be confused with hyphen. Usually
    it's flush left, I have never seen it in the left-hand magrin.  There are a lot
    of long words in Finnish (eg. saippuakauppias, a nice palindrom), so we use hyphens
    a lot."

  body: "There are different rules with different languages.\r\nIn Poland the em dash,
    followed by a en space, is the method of marking dialogue. New paragraph with
    dialog en dash at the beginning of the line should always has left indent.\r\n\r\nIn
    case that two dashes contain an inclusion. The em dash should never be set at
    the beginning of the line. All dashes inside the paragraph should be  set inside
    the line or at the end of a line. \r\nIn InDesign we f&r all 'space'^_'space'
    to ^s^_'space' and after that we f&r all ^s to space with NO BREAK attribute.
    Because of fact that the ^s has always fixed width when you justify line.\r\n\r\nWhen
    we have dash inside the word like for example 'pre-digital' in English, we have
    to hyphen such word first at the dash. And in this case we need to repeat the
    dash at the beginning of the next line. \r\nThat\u2019s why in such words we have
    to f&r all '\u2013' to ^-^~.\r\n\r\nInDesign hanging punctuation method is very
    hard to use in this case. Right margin is rather OK, but at the left margin I
    have to use my own patent. Before the beginning em dash in dialog paragraphs I
    always set ZERO WIDHT SPACE [u+200B]. \r\n\r\nThe same you can do before the bulets,
    numerals, quotation marks  and any characters at the begining of the line and
    at the begining of the paragraph. \r\n"

  body: "A couple of things you can do in this case:\r\n\r\n1. If you don't want the
    dash to be at the beginning of the line at all, insert a discretionary linebreak
    after it; this will almost always cause it to jump back up to the previous line.
    Only if that line is too tight already will the dash be left on a line by itself
    using this technique.\r\n\r\n2. If you don't mind the dash being at the beginning
    of the line, but just don't want it to hang in the margin, insert a discretionary
    linebreak before the dash, and then insert a hairspace or zero-width space."

  body: "\r\nJohn, \r\n\r\na much better solution is to mark the space before the
    endash with the \"No Break\" attribute in InDesign. BTW, due to the French Resistance
    (i.e. intense lobbying of French users of InDesign), the InDesign developers team
    made the silly decision of defining the non-breaking space as fixed-width. For
    Czech and Polish, there is exceptional treating and when the text is tagged as
    being set in one of these languages, the non-breaking space is variable-width.
    I always felt it's a silly decision: non-breaking space should always be variable-width
    just like the normal space. \r\n\r\nAll: \r\n\r\nHenryk Jursz has written an excellent
    free script for InDesign called UseMyTypo. It's written in JavaScript and works
    in both Mac and Windows versions of InDesign CS and CS2. The script does tons
    of useful microtypographic stuff: removes double-spaces, replaces double hyphens
    and hyphens between digits with proper long dashes, reformats quotation marks,
    recognizes e-mail addresses and URLs and applies custom styles to them, replaces
    regular spaces with non-breaking spaces in specific situations (between digits,
    before one-letter words or long dashes, between digits and certain abbreviations)
    and finally replaces the (non-stretching) non-breaking spaces into (stretching)
    normal spaces with the \"no break\" attribute turned on. \r\n\r\nYou can download
    the script for free from: \r\nhttp://www.jursz.com/skrypty_free_en.htm\r\n\r\nDownload
    the .zip file and place the extracted files into the Presets/Scripts/ folder inside
    of your InDesign folder. Then the script will become available from the InDesign
    Scripts palette (Window/Automation/Scripts). \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "I was a bit too fast. The current version of UseMyTypo allows you to automatically
    insert non-breaking spaces *after* specific one-letter words but not before long
    dashes. You need to manually run Find/Change and replace \" ^>\" by \"^s^>\" or
    \" ^m\" by \"^s^m\", and then run the UseMyTypo script which will replace the
    (non-stretching) non-breaking spaces into (stretching) normal spaces with the
    \u201Cno break\u201D attribute turned on. This way, you will prevent long dashes
    to appear at the beginning of the line when they're preceded by a space. \r\n\r\nI
    did send Henryk a suggestion to add this particular feature to his script. Perhaps
    he'll add it in near future. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
