  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi Everyone,
Im new here (Hello) but i came here for help. After reading around the forums and doing some other resarch of course too i am pretty much set that i want my final major project to be based around type. My problem is that i get to choose what its about. Now that doesnt sound too bad but i havnt a clue what i want to do for it. This sounds like one of those situations where anyone reading this will go &ldquo;well if you dont know what to do how are we going to know&rdquo; well really what im asking of all you helpfull people is if you have seen,read,know of any outstanding work which was based on a design brief or set of rules. Also anything else you can think of that&rsquo;l help me becuase i am really stuck! my one and only idea is to design evocative typography based around the theme of hate is beutifull but that is a very vague FMP. Btw im not BA :( im ND i know its silly to be this worried about a FMP at this level but im sure everyone has work they did when they first started out that they are really proud of. Well i want this to be it for me :)</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch!
Karl</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your course is graphic design I assume?</p>
<p>Start by thinking about what interests you; make a list of topics and consider also how you might manifest these into exciting personal portfolio pieces. I have seen students take a desperate stab in the dark at choosing an FMP topic, only to realise that they have bitten off more than they can chew or that they soon grow tired of a subject that they initially thought would be exciting. Don&rsquo;t forget that this project needs to sustain your interest for around nine (?) weeks. What type of (typographic) projects have you found most intersting and enjoyable so far?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know its silly to be this worried about a FMP at this level&rdquo;
No, it&rsquo;s not silly, I suspect that you are preparing a portfolio for HE or employment. You&rsquo;re right to be concerned about the outcome.</p>
<p>Above all, you need to discuss this at length with your tutors as soon as possible.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes its graphics, and its a 10 week project. Im taking a gap year between year 2 nd graphics and a ba in graphics to get some industry experiance as it is quite a diffrent world than college and uni! The most enjoyable project so far was a global warming awarness campaign but after talking to my brother (year 3 of graphics ba) it seems everyone and there dog is doing a global warming awarness campaigns and i know i could do another one and i would hope it would be good/better than others but if its a overdone project than i feel it would hav type is te lost its zing if i talk to someone about it. The thing that i like the most out ofhe contruction of it (of course) but i often see mixed media type peices where the type has been constructed out of carpet,fire,thread anything the list is endless. true you have a point about it needign to sustain me for 10 weeks and maybe this is a large factor towards what i am thinking about doing. thank you so much t bones thats helped a great deal!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi guys
Thought id update you on what im most likely going to do for my fmp. I will be producing two a2 posters promoting diverse music being brodcasted by digital radio, the way this is going to be done is by creating two stories (probly one love and one hate) and make a mix tape thing (which when my fmp is being shown will be played) of the lyrics being sung as you read the lyrics being typographically represented on the a2 posters. ive givern a little bit of thought about this and the way im going to do the posters is to look at each snippet of lyric. For example jayz saying &lsquo;i dont know&rsquo; from 99 problems as a peice of the overall puzzle and work on them indivuadaly looking closely at how i can best represent &lsquo;i dont know&rsquo; from jay z typographically without looking at the genre of music that it has come from. The idea behind it being that whatever genre of music you prefer, they are all saying the same thing (roughly :S) What do you guys think&hellip; honestly :) its abit experimental and might be a little to complex in my opinion tyring to explain it to people but i think it has creative potential.</p>
<p>thanks alot karl</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Karl,</p>
<p>“its abit experimental and might be a little to complex in my opinion tyring to explain it to people but i think it has creative potential.”</p>
<p>Agreed, I think the project has potential, though the brief needs to be tighter. Just a couple of questions:</p>
<p>Firstly, these “a2 posters promoting diverse music being brodcasted by digital radio”.</p>
<p>Who is the typical listener?</p>
<p>Is this a new station or a station trying to draw in a new group of listeners?</p>
<p>How diverse is the music? You mention Jayz (of whom I know little) but let’s say the music played is truly diverse, like world music for example. Then the poster might be markedly different to that with an R’n’B angle.</p>
<p>How important is it to promote the digital aspect? Is it digital radio that’s the focus of attention or a specific broadcasting station?</p>
<p>I don’t understand the ‘love/hate’ concept. How and why did you arrive at that?</p>
<p>Is there any other copy?</p>
<p>I think you need to consider <strong>exactly</strong> what it is that you want your posters to do. Keep distilling the ideas until the focus is that much clearer. Simplify.</p>
<p>Finally, have you discussed these ideas with your tutors? They should be helping you and they will be marking your work. Utilise them.</p>
<p>Perhaps post your initial draft ideas on Typophile’s critique section.</p>
