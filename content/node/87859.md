  create a customized version of [[http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Snippet
  | Snippet]] which I have called Bellota.\r\n\r\nI ended up changing quite a few
  of the letterforms, more than I expected.\r\nI am still at an early stage, so no
  spacing, kerning or punctuation is done. But I'd like to get feedback on the letterforms.
  There are a few characters which I'm not sure if they work, like M.\r\nAny feedback
  will be appreciated\r\n<img src=\"http://screensnapr.com/e/L1eRYI.png\" alt=\"bellota\"/>\r\nCan't

  body: The swash elemants don't fit. Take away ALL 'swashes' and repost if you want
    to make some progress. Perhaps in a later stadium you can start addig them again,
    but I doubt you'll still want to by then. Good luck!

  body: "I like it. Bellota has a lovely overall result. But I see some improvements
    to do.\r\n\r\nI don't know which elements Jasper call swashes and which may be
    understood as terminals. But for me the fancy terminals used in lowercase work
    well in most pairs (but definetively not when v or w are inside a word).\r\n\r\nFor
    the uppercase set, the terminals at right side produce so much spacing to the
    next letter (especially M). They may work as alternates or swash endings. In other
    hand, terminals at left would work well most of times <em>if</em> the letter is
    beginning a word. For continuous uppercase, these terminals also cause excessive
    spacing.\r\n\r\nOther small points: C and G seem distorted for me. Left swash
    in A and K seen unnecessary. The loops in f and y are almost touching the other
    elements and need correction. Bottom of g is very large. J does not work, it is
    very small and weak besides other letters (what about try a larger, open, descending
    one)?\r\n\r\nAnyway, a nice project. Keep it going."

  body: "Thnk you for your feedback. I agree I have some mixed feelings about the
    \"swashes\" especially in the uppercase and how they will work. I'm OK with the
    font not working in an all-caps context, but I guess more work is needed so that
    they at least work well next to lowercase. \r\n\r\nOn to working on this.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Kemie, \r\nI'm a fan of your work since the days of Flash 4 :)\r\nWill
    love to help. Here are a few suggestions.\r\n\r\nOn the lowercase:\r\n- I will
    only remove the swashes only on the \"v\" and \"w\".\r\n\r\n- On the top part
    of the \"u\" and the \"y\", you can make it more like the ones on the \"m,n,p,r\".\r\n\r\n-
    On the bottom of the \"u\", like the one on the \"a,d,h,i,l,m,n\". Or you can
    test how they look if you make it all like the ones at the top of the \"m,n,p,r\"
    (but inverted).\r\n\r\n- Add a just a little bit more of white space on the sidebearing.
    So the letters has more room to breath.\r\n\r\nOn the Caps:\r\n- I will remove
    the bottom swashes of the A, H, K, M, R, X.\r\n- Increase the with of the swashes
    on the top of the B, D, P, R. They are too close to the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "So I've done more work on this and \"rationalized\" the swashes:\r\n-Uppercase
    letters get a swash on the entry stroke, except letters with diagonals:  R, K,
    X\r\n-lowercase letters get a swash on the exit stroke, except m, n, p, u, y,
    r, v & w that get a subtle curve on the entry stroke.\r\n\r\nI also opened up
    the swashes on the caps, redeigned lowercase g and y and tweaked many other letterforms.
    I'm still unhappy with N and J. Disregard spacing and kerning as I've done nothing
    on that front yet.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing more feedback!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bellota_text2_4997.jpg]\r\n\r\n[[http://pixilate.com/dreamless/bellota_text2.pdf

    loop and the bar are too close.\r\n\r\nAlso, a slightly \"aggressive\" shape usually
    causes\r\nreal trouble when doubled (this happens often with\r\nthe binocular
    \"g\") so you might want alternates.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
