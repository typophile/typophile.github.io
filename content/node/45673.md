body: "I am looking for an elegant and timeless feeling typeface that has a distinctive
  feel. It will be set at a fairly small size (8-18 pt) and won't be used for any
  large bodies of text. It will probably be a serif, but there might be a sans that
  could also work.\r\n\r\nMy first choice now is Requiem, but I am looking for some
  alternatives that have a more unique look. (For example I really like the cap Y
  in Requiem.) I am also looking at Mason from Emigre, though it may be a little too
  quirky. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions of something along those lines would be much appreciated.
  Thanks."

  body: "I just discovered Requiem myself, and I have to say that I'm quit impressed
    with it.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on Brioso Pro (Opticals and Poster)? I
    find the face to be lovely, elegant, and when I look at it, I see the Carolingian
    Renaissance on up through the ages. To me it seems staid enough for business correspondence,
    but has an elegance suitable for poetry or invitations, or scholarly works.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nKeith\r\n\r\nFabricando
