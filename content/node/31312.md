body: If a typeface is very graphic/display or contains gradients or whatnot which
  only ai.- format allows, leaving kerning to the customer.... Some graphic vector
  elements are sold that way. Would it be a good idea for a typeface?

  body: "If you mean for it to be used as a graphic then it's perfectly fine to sell
    it as an illustration. One example of which is the high rez scanned woodtype from
    http://www.withoutwalls.com/index.htm\r\n\r\nLetterror used to sell it's <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/index.html\">Federal
    typefaces</a> as an illustrator file that you could typeset online. And soon House
    Industries will offer the same old-school technique made new with an online version
    of the <a href=\"http://www.photo-lettering.com/\">Photo-Lettering</a> catalog.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I can't imagine there would be a (big) market for typefaces in AI.-format,
    but if it's anything like Ken's links, I'd for one be a potential customer ;-)
