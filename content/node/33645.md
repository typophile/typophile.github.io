  body: "Wow! I'm impressed. I've been noticing how many of these oddballs you seem
    to get. You must spend a lot of time in 'font backwaters'.\r\n\r\nI've looked
    over the Apostrophic Lab fonts many times over the years, and have written to,
    and gotten samples from, several of the designers, but I can't recall them as
    well as you seem to be able to do.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I always double-check IDs before I credit, but there's a very limited numbers
    of IDers whose skills I trust so much that I feel I don't need to do that with
    their IDs. Angel is one of them.

    you read that? Not that I don't believe you, Mike, but want to read more of it

  body: "I downloaded the font from TypOasis, which has a whole collection of the
    <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/index.htm\">Apostrophic
    Lab</a> fonts. The font info file itself credits 'Alejandro Paul & Apostrophic
    Labs'.  I believe that 'Apostrophe' knows Alejandro.\r\n\r\nI also did some Google
    searches with 'Usenet and Alejandro' and found a number of results linking them.
    (I was dubious at first too.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
