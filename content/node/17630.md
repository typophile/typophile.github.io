  body: "This is ******* from ********. Since the creator of the font went along and
    expanded the family but was forced by the previous foundry to sell it under a
    (much) different name than the initial Barmen City, it can be now found as <a
    href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_singles_main.ep?id=128949\">FF Sari Black</a>\r\n\r\nDid
    I get the story right?\r\nThanks Dav for warning us towards posting font and foundry
    names :-)"
