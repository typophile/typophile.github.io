body: I&#39;m doing some prelim work/ research for a pro-bono client that&#39;s related
  to theatre. I&#39;d like to draw some subtle inspiration from old playbills, broadsheets,
  etc. from the era of Shakespeare &#40;which is around Gutenberg&#39;s time&#41;,
  but I&#39;m willing to look at other pre-1900s eras that had interesting stylistic
  qualities. Everyone&#39;s so familiar with the strong graphic styles of the 20th
  century, but I want to see early work that did rely on graphics and colors as much.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for good resources &#40;books or web&#41; to peruse. I&#39;d
  like to see the type itself, but how it was composed for the theatre and any decorative
  elements used to complement it are actually more of interest to me. I know this
  is vague, but the project&#39;s a little open-ended and I can&#39;t really get into
  it until we&#39;re close to completion. <BR> <BR>To be honest, I&#39;m not even
  sure there&#39;s much to be found in the earlier time periods I described, so I&#39;m
  really just looking for a few good samples. I plan on hitting the stacks later this
  week, but any leads would do me a world of good.

    Gutenberg&#39;s.

  body: Yeah, it was late last night when I posted. I was conflating 1500&#39;s with
    15th century to create a silly mistake. Too much work, too little time.  <IMG
