body: "Adobe today released on Adobe Labs <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/11/tlf.html\">the
  Text Layout Framework</a>, new pre-release components that extend text, font and
  language support of Flash and AIR. In fact, the recently demonstrated <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/51966\">IHT
  Reader</a> is based on this technology.\r\n\r\nI've been watching and giving feedback
  on this technology for many many months now, and am highly impressed with what the
  team has achieved, so this public pre-release is very exciting for me. I think it's
  a <em>huge</em> leap forwards for text functionality in Flash and AIR.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
