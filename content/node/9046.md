body: I&#39;m working on a webpage for a friend of mine, and she really wants to use
  the Papyrus font on the page. I know how to accomplish this using a css sheet, however,
  I can&#39;t find a way to convert the font to TrueDoc format &#40;.pfr&#41; so that
  it will display in all browsers. <BR> <BR>If anyone on this board can help me with
  this, I would be eternally greatful! <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    is the only real cross-platform solution I know that allows custom fonts.  <BR>

  body: You can look around the TrueDoc web site &#40;<a href="http://www.truedoc.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.truedoc.com/</a>&#41;, but I don&#39;t think the authoring
    tool is available anymore. It was called WebFont Wizard &#40;or WebFont Maker?&#41;.

  body: Tim, I&#39;ve been all over the TrueDoc website, and it isn&#39;t available
    for download anymore. I&#39;ve found a number of types of software that incorporate
    TrueDoc into the package, but I don&#39;t want to pay hundreds of dollars for
    something I&#39;ll only use once. <BR> <BR>Adam, thanks, I&#39;ll check that out.

  body: Bitstream&#39;s Webtype Maker was discontinued in 2001 or 2002. There was
    also a product called typograf too by a company called Hexmac. I don&#39;t think
    the other tools will make a PFR for Web use. Glyphgate would be youyr best bet.

  body: Depending on just how much text you need to set in Papyrus and how your programming
    skills are, you can also use code &#40;PHP, .NET and others&#41; to dynamically
    change the text into GIF images. There are obvious drawbacks to this approach,
    but it might be worth considering.

  body: Another technique that might be worth investigating is <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2004/08/sifr">sIFR</a>,
    which uses Flash to deliver custom type &#40;and degrades gracefully if Flash
    is not installed&#41;.

  body: Wait, so sIFR is actually an &#34;engine&#34; for decent typesetting in Flash?
    <BR>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been clamoring for for ages!! <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: sIFR is a way to get arbitrary fonts into web pages. It doesn&#39;t do anything
    typographically that can&#39;t already be done in Flash. Basically, using a bit
    of Javascript and CSS, it replaces, say, &#60;h1&#62; headings with a small Flash
    swf containing the same text but in your chosen font. <BR> <BR>More information
