body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how can I create class that will contain ALL
  glyphs exept a particular one? (lowercase s in my case)\r\n\r\nI have googled for
  hours and studied the FontLab manual a lot, but I can't find an answer.\r\n\r\nI
  could perhaps do it with character ranges, but which ones should I use? Based on
  which encoding?\r\n\r\nSorry if its a stupid question, I'm quite a beginner in all
  this...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: You can make classes in FontLab by first creating a new class in the Classes
    panel and then simply selecting the glyphs you want to include from the Font Window
    and dragging them into the top right portion of the Classes panel. So, create
    a new class, then use Ctrl+A (or Mac equivalent) to select all the glyphs in the
    Font Window, then use Ctrl click to unselect the one that you do not want in the
    class, then drag and drop all the selected glyphs into the Classes panel.

    but what happens when I add new glyphs? :/\r\nWhat I'm looking for is some kind
    of [not s] definition for a class. If I have to add the glyphs manually, I know
    how to do it...\r\n\r\nAlso, adding the glyphs manually doesn't account for the
    case of start or end of the text..."

    you are attempting to do.

  body: "I tried the ignore sub with many ways, but it doesn't seem to work for what
    I want it to do.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is:\r\nI have 2 alternate s, that change
    based to the preceding or next character.\r\nI also have two different s that
    are used when the next or preceding character (respectively) is also an s, and
    another s to be used when both the preceding and next character is an s. \r\nThis
    totals to 1 normal s and 7 contextual alternates. \r\n\r\nThe code from the calt
    feature that has to do with any of them is the below (irrelevant subs removed):\r\n<code>\r\n
    \ @not_s = [a-r t-z e.alt s.alt2 space period .notdef CR ];\r\n  @is_s = [s s.alt
    s.alt1 s.alt11 s.alt2 s.alt21 s.alt22 s.alt3];\r\n  sub @not_s s' [a f t z w u
    y b] by s.alt;\r\n  sub @is_s s' [a f t z w u y b] by s.alt22;\r\n  sub @not_s
    s' s by s.alt1;\r\n  sub @not_s s.alt2' s by s.alt11;\r\n  sub [s.alt1 s.alt11
    s.alt3] s' s by s.alt3;\r\n  sub @is_s s' @not_s by s.alt21;\r\n  sub s.alt3 s.alt'
    by s.alt22;\r\n  # fresset!\r\n  sub f.alt r.alt e.alt s.alt11 s.alt21 e' t' by
    s_t.logo;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOf course the @not_s class is completely temporary
    and doesn't contain lots of glyphs. What I want it to contain is every glyph that
    is not a lowercase s (including start and end of lines, even though they aren't
    glyphs, although I doubt its possible :( ). \r\nIf that isn't possible, can anyone
    think of a way to do it with ignore sub? I have a strong feeling that ignore sub
    is the way to go, but everything I tried with it doesn't work :(\r\nThis is troubling
    me for several hours but I can't figure out a more complete solution... :("

  body: "Okay, lets simplify the problem a bit.\r\nLets suppose I only have s.alt1
    which I want to place instead of s before every lowercase s and s.alt3 which I
    want to place instead of s when s is between two other s (sss). The problem is
    that in the second case, the middle s would be substituted by s.alt1 because it
    also precedes an s.\r\n\r\nThis does not work:\r\n<code>\r\nlookup calt_s1 {\r\n
    \ \tignore substitute s s' s;\r\n  \tsub s' s by s.alt1;\r\n  } calt_s1;\r\n</code><code>\r\n
    \ lookup calt_s3 {\r\n  \tsub s s' s by s.alt3;\r\n  } calt_s3;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis
    neither:\r\n<code>\r\nlookup calt_s1 {\r\n  \tignore substitute s s' s;\r\n  \tsub
    s' s by s.alt1;\r\n  } calt_s1;\r\n</code><code>\r\n  lookup calt_s3 {\r\n  \tsub
    s.alt1 s' s by s.alt3;\r\n  } calt_s3;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nbut this does:\r\n<code>\r\nlookup
    calt_s1 {\r\n  \tignore substitute s s' s;\r\n  \tsub [a-z space] s' s by s.alt1;\r\n
    \ } calt_s1;\r\n</code><code>\r\n  lookup calt_s3 {\r\n  \tsub s.alt1 s' s by
    s.alt3;\r\n  } calt_s3;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe reason I don't want the latter solution
    is that I have to create a class with every glyph, and it would still be incomplete,
    because I would also have to match somehow the start and end of the text.\r\nWhat
    seems to be the problem, is that ignore sub does not work if the pattern given
    to it is not an exact subcase of the substitution below. In the first case, since
    ignore sub had s s' s and the pattern was s' s, it didn't work. When we converted
    the substitution pattern to [a-z space] s' s it worked, as s s' s is a subcase
    of that. \r\nHowever this behavior conflicts with the Adobe [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#5.f.ii|specification]]
    (see example 1, even though the pattern is [a e n] d' and the exceptions f [a
    e] d' and a d' d, they are supposed to work.\r\n\r\nSo, the possibilities are
    two:\r\n1. I'm not grasping something correctly\r\n2. Its a FontLab bug (?!)\r\n\r\nMy
    bet would be on 1. So what am I missing? :("
