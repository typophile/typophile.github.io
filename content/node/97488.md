  (Selected), Improvisation, Education and Training, Skills. \r\n\r\nI really love
  the lowercase \"t,\" with the big scoop and the half-crossbar. I've taken a crack
  at this one on Identifont and Whatthefont, but alas... I need help. Quite the little
  community here -- thanks in advance, y'all!"
