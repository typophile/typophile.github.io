  in OT.\r\nI built an Arabic font with ligatures put in rlig for Arabic and in dlig
  for optional general use. Only Indesign behaves as expected and in MS Office and
  OpenOffice ligatures are activated no matter what language is set."

    MIF to a language as 'default yes' and the same part to another language as 'default
    no'?"
