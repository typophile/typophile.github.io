  my magazine project. It needs to be neat but casual. I am considering generating
  my own handwriting font, but then my handwriting isn't \"American\" enough.\r\n\r\nIs
  there any font that you would recommend? \r\n\r\nPlease let me know!\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much,\r\ntsongtze"

    It's hard to describe what I really want.\r\nI think the closest so far is the
    Rats font... Any more suggestions?"
