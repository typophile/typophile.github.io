    of the Apple purchasing habits I mention in the thread that you linked to starting
    this talk :(\r\n\r\nWell, I may be an eco-monster, although not because of this.
    I also don't have a car, and have been commuting with public transportation to

    Reading\u2026 here, I walk to school).\r\n\r\nAs for my four laptops and two iPods
    since 1999\u2026\r\n\r\n1. When my first laptop died I sold it to a repair shop
    (who wanted to take it apart) for $100. So I hope that many of the parts got reused
    and not thrown straight away.\r\n\r\n2. When so many parts of my second laptop
    died, I gave it to my mother, who had much of it repaired at her own costs, and
    now she uses it as a stationary machine.\r\n\r\n3. My third laptop still hasn't
    died! It lives in Berlin, being periodically used. \r\n\r\n4. I'm still using
    my fourth laptop every day ;-) \r\n\r\nAs for my first iPod, well, that probably
    is in a landfill somewhere. My second iPod is safe and sound, right next to me.\r\n\r\nFrom
    1995\u20131999 I had a desktop Performa. This never got thrown away. It lives

  body: "I just ran into this thing... Cool.\r\n\r\n1977: Commodore PET 2001-8\r\nPurchased
    in Palo Alto for $800. Neighbors had no idea what it was. We weren't too sure
    either. Internal cassette drive (speed estimated at 50 bytes/second). Traded in
    to CBM dealer in Beirut for purchase of next item. Still kicking self for that.\r\n\r\n1980:
    Commodore PET 4016\r\nExternal cassette drive. Donated to my high school upon
    purchase of next item. They never touched it. So my brother and I basically broke
    into their storage room one evening and did an extraction. Still in my parents'
    basement in Beirut.\r\n\r\n1982: Commodore 64\r\nWhat an amazing machine that
    was. Next to the PET in the basement. Has the external floppy drive (which cost
    more than the computer), and I was in awe of its blazing speed and massive 170Kb
    capacity.\r\n\r\n1987: Amiga 500\r\n1.5Mb Ram. No hard disk. Ran Fontographer
    3.1 under Mac emulation (used a virtual RAM-Drive partition to fake a hard disk).
    Added a weird daughterboard to support an over-clocked FPU (used to do ray-traced
    animation). Donated to a very small Armenian TV show in LA for videotitling upon
    purchase of next item.\r\n\r\n1992: Amiga 3000\r\nHard disk! Killer machine. Still
    in garage.\r\n\r\n199?: Commodore Plus-4\r\nPurchased at garage sale. Sold at
    garage sale.\r\n\r\n1995: Self-built PC box (386)\r\nUsed for testing fonts. Still
    in garage.\r\n\r\n1996: Apple IIcx\r\nPicked up on the way to being dumped. Used
    for testing fonts. Trashed upon acquisition of next item.\r\n\r\n1998: Apple Quadra\r\nPicked
    up on the way to being dumped. Used for testing fonts. Trashed.\r\n\r\n2000: Dell
    laptop - Latitude 14\"\r\nPurchased used. The first non-Commodore I ever liked.
    My gray warrior. Sold via eBay upon purchase of next item.\r\n\r\n2003: Compaq
    laptop - 15\"\r\nCrappy machine. CPU melted when fan got blocked. Data all OK!\r\n\r\n2006:
    Dell laptop - Inspiron 17\"\r\nPretty ugly, but solid worker. Current main machine.\r\n\r\n2009:

  body: "1984: Texas Instruments TI 99/4A. Really no more than a huge desktop calculator
    with a tape drive. What a piece of junk. Its built-in BASIC sucked. Scrapped.\r\n\r\n1985:
    Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48+ (not the rubbery keyboard jobby, but a sleek black one
    with <em>proper</em> keys!). Fairly slow, until I learned to program in raw Z80
    machine code. Bliss! Sold to a friend on next purchase.\r\n\r\n1986: Sinclair
    ZX Spectrum 128. Built-in tape drive, more memory, nice advanced sound chip (a
    Yamaha, if I'm correct). For the rest pretty same as above. Sold on next purchase.\r\n\r\n1988:
    Brand new Atari ST 520. Yes, the Amiga was better graphically, but this was a
    lot cheaper. Learned 68000 assembler. Wrote an almost-complete Postscript emulator.
    Checked out Mac programs. Played games. Lent it to a friend (and never got it
    back) after next purchase.\r\n\r\n1989/1990: (ish) Second hand Acorn Archimedes
    A3000. Double disk drive, but still no hard drive. Learned ARM assembler. Incredibly
    powerful machine -- learned to program for PCs through its emulator. Still have
    it, but no monitor to hook it up to ...\r\n\r\n1991: Self-built 486 PC. Learned
    8086 assembler and C. Bought a virtual reality helmet and learned to write programs
    for it. A new dimension to graphics! Traded in for next purchase.\r\n\r\n..2009:
    Various PCs, all Frankenstein-wise containing salvaged parts from previous PCs.
    Ransacked items travelled down the family to dad, brothers, sisters, until (presumably)
    old beyond measure and scrapped. Learned C++ and wrote all kinds of programs for
    Windows, with various success.\r\n\r\n2009: Dawn of a new age: while writing,
    I'm still oogling this shiny new 21.5\" iMac. Learning XCode as we speak. Posting
    this because my head hurts of going <em>again</em> through a major programming
    paradigm change.\r\n\r\nPrice-wise I don't appear to have learned something; always
    shelling out near-top prices for machines that are advertised to be very nearly
    \"top of the bill\" for no more than 6 months.\r\nMemory-wise I amuse my younger
    colleagues with stories of 48K, filled to the point of overflowing, where this
    machine has about 80,000 times that much.\r\nPerformance-wise: here I am, staring
    at a 1920 x 1080 32-bit color screen and trying to decide how this is <em>more</em>
    fun than 256x192, black-and-white ..."

    Pro 17\" (unibody) My current main computer.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm kind of a Mac
    guy. I've only listed computers that were my primary or, in a few cases, secondary
    computer. Unless noted as sold, I still have them, either in use somewhere in
    the house or gathering dust. I also picked up a few other computers that I don't
    actually use much, such as an original Compaq PC \"luggable\" (acquired in 1996),
    and a Sinclair ZX81 (2000). I have set up in my basement a Mac SE, an LC III and
    my old PowerMac G3 so I can boot up any pre-OS X Mac system if I need to access
    very old files or programs. Not that I've found much need to do so, as it has
    turned out. I've also left out computers my partner or daughter use (the odd iMac,
    iBook, or MacBook), not to mention a Newton MessagePad 110 (still works) and a
    Palm IIIx.\r\n\r\nMy first Mac cost $2500 in 1984. The most expensive was probably
    the 840av, at about $4700 in 1993. My most recent, the MacBook Pro 17\", was $2800,
    nominally higher in price than my first Mac, but only about $1300 in 1984 dollars.
    Plus, it's about 325 times faster, has over 30,000 times a much memory, 12 times
    as much screen area (in full color), and weighs less than a third as much.\r\n\r\nMy
    all-time favorite so far is my current MacBook Pro. My least favorite was the
    HP Pavilion, which was incredibly cheap and underpowered, had a big blue light
    on the front that blinked on and off when it was asleep (I'M ASLEEP!... I'M ASLEEP!...
    I'M ASLEEP!) and would wake randomly for no apparent reason."

    that machine...\r\n\r\nworked on lots of p.c. machinery after that.\r\n\r\nand
    for the last decade or more, macs only.\r\n(a handful of them, and 2 iphones as
    well.)\r\n\r\nmy machines are always tight, and run well.\r\ni don't tolerate
    any bloat, or random crashes.\r\n\r\ni've also found that memory, hard-drive size,\r\nand
    monitor size are crucially important, even\r\nto the point that the machine-type
    is dwarfed.\r\n\r\nwhile doing statistical work in graduate school\r\nfor a professor
    who was consulting for xerox,\r\ni came across the alto/bravo machines, with\r\na
    portrait monitor, and became fixated on it.\r\n\r\nall i wanted was the ability
    to see a full page\r\nof a document at a reasonable size, which is\r\ncertainly
    not an unreasonable request, is it?\r\n\r\ni worked a shit job once, for far too
    long, just\r\nbecause it let me work on a portrait monitor...\r\n\r\nyear after
    year after year, i waited, patiently,\r\nbut it seemed like the monitor manufacturers\r\nwere
    bound and determined to stall things out\r\nwith monitors that gave not-quite-a-full-page.\r\n\r\nfinally,
    about 5 years back, i got a 23-inch\r\ncinema monitor, where i can now see _two_\r\npages
    of a document at a reasonable text-size.\r\nit's really nice to finally get something
    that you\r\nhave wanted for two decades, let me tell you...\r\n\r\nadd to that
    a terabyte drive sitting on my desk,\r\nand things are pretty good for me right
    now...\r\n\r\ni could use some more memory in this macbook,\r\nespecially since
    today's browsers are bloatware\r\n(and unavoidable, since the web is now required),\r\nbut
    other than that, i'm not complaining too much.\r\n\r\nlooking back, there's only
    one machine that i wish\r\ni would have bought -- one of the amigas that were\r\nvideo-capable
    way back in the old-days, years before\r\nother machines caught up to 'em (if
