  body: "Yes, and that was my first guess too, yet I can't seem to find it on my HD.
    I have Berthold, ITC and Adobe versions but none of then have a \"black\" weight.\r\n\r\nDoes
    it perhaps have a different name I can't recall?\r\n\r\nIt's only $30 so if push
    comes to shove, I can simply buy it again. Kind of a rush job.\r\n\r\n\r\nc"

    hence the name."

    tell you the story once the job is out the door.\r\n\r\nIt's not perfect, but
    the A is a little closer.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing it was hand done regardless.\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot folks. I love the help I can get here.\r\n\r\n\r\nc"
