  body: That sure is a font. It's an old GarageFonts release created in the <em>Raygun</em>
    era by Rodney Shelden Fehsenfeld. No longer available for sale, although he has
    been known to sell directly if someone asks nicely.

  body: Yes, Patty, it's really a font, as I said, from the Raygun days. Experimental,
    DIY, non-beautiful, illegible - that was the thing back then. Agreed a company
    should have a non-grunge logo in this day and age (and preferably one that's not
    just 3 letters from a typeface), but you can't always get them to update.

  body: Believe me I am well familiar with grunge (altho I am glad it's in the rearview
    mirror) . I even have some old David Carson fonts which are unfortunately no longer
    for sale, and some of which are quite nice like Serifed Sans and Gangly. This
    sample doesn't have that edgy DIY quality I associate with grunge, it just looks
    like crap.
