body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI generated a .ttf file of a font that was created in FontLab
  5.0. When I tried it out in Illustrator CS3, I found out that while my ligatures
  are working, for some reasons some parts of it drops out (image attached). \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_3425.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  really have no clue what's causing this, so I was wondering if someone could point
  out what might be going on and how to fix it. Also, this only happens with the ligatures
  starting with lowercase a \u2014 so I wonder if there's a possibility that there's
  some problems with the glyph that I probably overlooked?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nChrista"

    before generating the font?
