  body: Curtis, the R and C say otherwise. It's closer to Frutiger than it is Scala
    Sans.

    I took cues from the A, R, C and K, but there are still some discrepancies. It's
    a logotype, so any decent designer would have done some modifications. Also, there's
    a bazillion humanist/frutiger style clones out there.

  body: You're right. Neither seems to be a perfect match. Frutiger's C is closer,
    but the R doesn't match.
