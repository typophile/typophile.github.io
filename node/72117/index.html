Since I need to make a decision before purchasing and it's difficult to envision the two appearing in unison based just on [[http://www.lucasfonts.com/typeshow/?ts-font=TheAntiquaB&ts-style=Plain|TypeShow]], I'm wondering if you know of an online sample where the two appear in unison, or if not, what in your opinion would be the rational of matching the two together.

Your help is very much appreciated</div>

I offered an example; rationales and samples are beyond the call of duty.

I did not in fact recommend TheAntiqua as a partner for Dax: all I can say is that the art director of that particular magazine was able to make them "go well" with one another -- others might not be so successful. Or perhaps their time together is past.</div>

It's quite difficult for me to form an opinion without actually "seeing" the printed piece you are referring to, hence the question as to your recollection on the matter. It might surprise you, but yes, your personal opinion is highly regarded, and I don't think I deserve a beating just for asking (this is a help forum about 'opinions', isn't it?). In any event, I will respect your reluctance to elaborate and would like to thank you again for your response.

Back to square one, any ideas anyone?
Please help.</div>

My apologies if you found my reply harsh, Sam.
It certainly wasn't intended that way.
I don't have access to my library at the moment, as I haven't got around to unpacking it after a move last year, which is why I'm reluctant to go digging through boxes looking for old copies of NS that I might have hung onto, and then scanning and posting them for you. If you would consider paying me for that service, it would probably be less expensive to license the fonts.

If I am to be accused of a beating, let me continue...

How is it "difficult to envision the two appearing in unison"?
You can see with just a word of each, online, that they have very, very similar proportions: horizontal scale, x-height, ascender overshoot of cap height.

Surely you have worked with types that have similar proportions to each, so don't you have enough of a feeling about types with that kind of proportion, and about these types in particular (based on their detailing), to have enough of a feeling of how they will work together? And of how <em>you</em> might use them, without aping the design of <em>New Scientist</em>?
