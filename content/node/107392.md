  that has both common (e.g. between \"f\" and \"i\") and custom (e.g. between \"p\"
  and \"p\") ligatures and used FontLab to export the font in ttf.\r\nNow I want an
  HTML page to display the font and I write & #xFB01 for common ligature between \"f\"
  and \"i\".\r\nBut where should I operate to display custom ligature between \"p\"
  and \"p\"?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your attention!\r\nFilippo"

    what that means. \r\n\r\nOption 1: Give the pp ligature a unicode slot in the
    PUA area. This is the worst option, because it isn\u2019t indexable, copyable
    or readable for the blind. So, some users may not be able to read it \u2014 but
    all users can see the decoration.\r\n\r\nOption 2: Write an OT liga feature to
    substitute two p\u2019s for a pp ligature, and reference it with CSS. This is
    a somewhat better option. Text remains indexable, copyable and readable for all.
    Unfortunately, OpenType features are still not supported by all browsers. So,
    some users may not see the decoration \u2014 but all users can read it."

  body: "I think, Frode, we can safely assume he meant typeface and font.\r\n\r\nFilippo:
    MUFI (the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative) assigned the PUA slots uniEED6 to
    the pp ligature and uniEEDD to the PP ligature in its character lists. So, if
    you take the first route, these slots are slightly better than others. They would,
    in HTML, be &amp;#xEED6; and &amp;#xEEDD; respectively.\r\n\r\nBut as Frode says,
    the second option is better. Doing both may be even better, though."

  body: "Thank you guys and sorry for my English that is a bit unclear..! Yes I meant
    \"typeface\" instead of \"typography\".\r\n\r\nReturning to the problem I tried
    with the second option and discarded the first one! I created the glyphs (and
    ligatures) and kerning pairs in Fontlab and then activated them by css properties
    @font-face, text-rendering, font-variant-ligatures and font-feature-settings.\r\nThe
    result?\r\n\r\nGoogle Chrome on Mac: Ok but some kerning pairs are missing (e.g.
    between lowercase o and superscript 1).\r\nMozilla Firefox on Mac: Ok.\r\nOpera
    on Mac: Ok but some kerning pairs are missing (e.g. between lowercase o and superscript
    1).\r\nApple Safari on Mac: Fail, it does not render ligatures and, even more
    serious, kerning (!!!).\r\nInternet Explorer: Still not tested.\r\n\r\nGoogle
    Chrome on iPhone: Ok but some kerning pairs are missing (e.g. between lowercase
    a grave and z_z ligature).\r\nOpera on iPhone: Fail, it does not download .ttf
    font.\r\nApple Safari on iPhone: Ok but some kerning pairs are missing (e.g. between
    lowercase a grave and z_z ligature).\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it is difficult to
    identify the problem because, where there are minor problems, only some kerning
    pairs are missing. Any suggestion to fix this problem in cross-browsing?\r\nAnd
    what about desktop Apple Safari? Why doesn't it render kerning pairs?\r\n\r\nThank
    you in advance for your attention!\r\nFilippo"

  body: "To try to solve the problems I think I should tell you something more about
    my process in Fontlab, a software that I do not control very well yet.\r\n\r\nHere
    are the list of actions done:\r\n1) Created glyphs in Illustrator and imported
    to Fontlab (only a few glyphs).\r\n2) Specified the width of every glyph.\r\n3)
    Set the settings in \"Font Info\".\r\n4) Set the language system in the Open Type
    panel (languagesystem latn dflt;).\r\n5) Created the ligatures features in the
    Open Type panel (and compiled).\r\n6) Opened the Metrics panel and manually set
    the kerning between specific pairs of glyphs.\r\n7) Saved and exported font in
    .otf e .ttf formats (the one I tried on the html+css page is the True Type .ttf).\r\n\r\nI
    ask you experts if there is something wrong. Maybe the kerning problems in different
    browsers originates from the fact I set kerning in this way?\r\n\r\nThank you
    for the attention!\r\nFilippo"
