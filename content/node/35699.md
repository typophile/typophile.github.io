  body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nI aknowledge my ignorance. It is danish! Sorry.\r\nThe Origami
    its close, but it is not.\r\n\r\nThank to those who have answered. \r\nStill,
    does anyone think of another font \r\nthat might have similiar structure to the
    charater attached?\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced for more feedback.\r\n\r\nGiovanni"
