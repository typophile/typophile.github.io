  body: "Greg,\r\n\r\nIs this a logo for you personally, or a logo for you as a freelance
    designer that serves as a graphic shingle to appeal to folks in the action sports
    industry?\r\n\r\n<strong>If it's personal, dig deep and make it about YOU. What
    makes Greg tick? What arrangement of shapes or icons and/or typography describe
    you and only you?</strong>\r\n\r\nIf it's something that's supposed to feel \"sporty\"...well,
    I'm not sure what to tell you. I'm afraid it might be too easy to mimic sport
    logos for the sake of aligning yourself with that look. Again, it brings me back
    to the original question, as I would bet you might find more value\u2014for you
    and for your potential clients\u2014by making a personal mark that defines you.\r\n\r\nI've
    been through this exercise in the last year. It's a difficult but very satisfying
    exercise. For what it's worth, I created a personal logo, and as I worked on it,
    tweaked it, scrapped it, and redrew it again and again, one of my criteria was,
    \"Would I tattoo this on my body when I'm done?\"\r\n\r\nThe tattoo happens a
    week from today. And here's a link to the Typophile thread that shows the mark
    I created. Listen, I know the clouds aren't going to part with accompanying opera
    music when you see this. But it was a labor of love for me, and worth the effort.

  body: "Thanks for the response Dylan. To anwser your question it is not trying to
    mimic or look sporty. I should have mentioned that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was trying to
    really reflect the shape of waves. I am an easy going type guy who loves the ocean.
    \ I also love to dance.(I also do a lot of waves in my dancing.)\r\n\r\nbtw, I
    really like your mark. "

    going with this. Wow, suddenly I'm stoked about the possibilities of your name
    and how waves/water can be integrated. \r\n\r\nAre you a sketchbook guy? Have
    any existing sketches you've done for this? If not, have you taken an hour or
    two to bust out a large sketchpad, a dull pencil, and really enjoy some gestural
    drawing that might help you explore how these letterforms might, er, <strong>flow</strong>
    into one another?\r\n\r\nGreat project, man! Keep us posted as you progress.\r\n\r\nDylan
    -- who might be more stoked about your project than you are.  ;)"

    and it needed some tweaks but i liked the direction so last night I scanned and
    traced it. \r\n\r\n\r\n I would like to bookmark your page. Really diggin your
    illustrations. Is your site live yet? Do you have an address.\r\n\r\nHeres some
    more work I put into it. Iam still not a fan of the \"E\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greglogorevised_4413.gif]"

  body: "Loose thoughts: I like the contrast between the rectilinear forms and the
    wavy extensions. There's a beautiful visual connection that's happening between
    the extended wave form on the <strong>G</strong> and the <strong>R</strong>. And
    the <strong>second/last G</strong> is starting to work...I think it's a bit disconnected
    and a little slow to decipher right now because, unlike the other letterforms,
    it has no rigidity and it's completely freeflowing... I agree with you about the
    <strong>E</strong>. It feels forced...too tucked behind the other letters. <strong>OK...what
    if, as we move from the first G across, the letterforms gradually morph from rigid
    to wavelike?</strong> This loose train of thought might help you soften that E...mebbe
    take it to a lower case, which in turn will allow a more natural curve at the
    top of the letter. \r\n\r\nMy site, when done, will be at dylanmenges.com. Should
    be a few weeks until it's ready. Too many irons in the fire right now."

  body: "I agree Dylan the g and r combo are really what Iam liking. Ive been working
    on this all day and I realized that after probably thirty sketches and a bunch
    of attempts I need to emphasize the g and r. IF i carry the decender of the last
    g underneath the two it takes away from the design.  I think your idea of morphing
    the letterforms  would be interesting but I havent really put much into it and
    fear I will drive my self crazy trying to pull it off. I love the concept tho.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you or any typophile think? \r\n\r\nIt definately works well at very small
    sizes. It just needs a lot of tweaks. \r\n\r\nGreg[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greglogofinal_4951.gif]"

  body: "This is starting to resemble pictograms, which might not be inappropriate,
    but the R needs some work around the counter, I think it needs to be closed and
    some roundness introduced into the top half. I am reading the first G as 6, you
    could introduce some white lines where the flowing serif crosses the vertical,
    along the lines of where the lowest bar of the E is flowing into the second G.\r\nTim"
