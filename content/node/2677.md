  body: Woah, that file is over a megabyte! <BR> <BR>Save down to 16 colours, that&#39;s
    more than enough for anti-aliasing and it&#39;ll bring the file size down. <BR>
    <BR>Anyway, some letters like the B, P, G and W are squished, could be wider.  The
    S is weird, but I don&#39;t know enough to say why it is, someone else might be
    able to elabourate. <BR> <BR>I like the concept for the ampersand, but it looks
    very rough, needs to be fixed up a bit. <BR> <BR>Also, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s
    me or not, but the thickness of the letters doesn&#39;t seem to be very consistant.

  body: Ok, I&#39;ll try it again.  This one&#39;s only 21 K.  I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s
    up with the thickness not seeming even, as every vertical line is a consistent
    mathematical width.  If you could tell me which characters seem inconsistent with
    others, that might help if there is an optical distortion that I don&#39;t see
    because I&#39;m so close.  I&#39;m taking a look at the P,B,G,and W.  Thanks.

  body: 'I think what Chris means about the thickness is some of your diagonals: like
    the M, that is way off from the rest. It isn&#39;t really up to mathmatical precision
    of your stems, it is also things like the terminals and horiz/vert joins and the
    spaces around and within the glyphs. The size of the  &#39;e&#39;,  for example,
    iseems larger and lighter than the &#39;d&#39;. The hairlines in &#39;v&#39; seem
    thinner than those of the &#39;y&#39;. This is a good, fairly complete start!
    I reckon the next step is to make the glyphs a little more consistent. <BR> <BR>kris.'

  body: God help me, but this is just a small sample of they glyphs in this face.  I
    have about a thousand glyphs, including 50 ligatures so far, nearly complete Greek
    and Cyrillic glyphsets, IPA characters, and extended Latin characters.  The reason
    I put the simple Roman out is that I can use that information throughout the face.  The
    mistakes I&#39;ve made here are ones I have probably made everywhere, and I&#39;ve
    already started using these critiques throughout.

  body: You can&#39;t rely on mathematics alone.  You have to compensate sometimes
    for thing to look optically correct. <BR> <BR>To me f h i and j look too thick,
    and the k looks too thin.  A couple other letters look out of sorts as well. <BR>
    <BR>Though, this could be an artifact of turning your outlines into bitmaps as
    well.  A PDF&#39;d sample would be helpful.

  body: '&#62; I have about a thousand glyphs <BR> <BR>Ouch. The &#34;plunge&#34;
    seems to have been a while ago, actually... <BR> <BR>Well, the good news is that
    such obsessive behavior is a requirement for type design.  :-&#41; <BR>The bad
    news is that -as far as I&#39;m concerned- just what you&#39;ve shown really needs
    a <i>lot</i> of polish... <BR> <BR>Unless the intent -or at least an acceptable
    result- is to have a rough, &#34;naive&#34; looking font, there are issues of
    both structure and finish that need to be commanded before you worry about the
    <i>quantity</i> of glyphs. I don&#39;t want to be discouraging - in fact I think
    your heart is in the right place! But before you do any more bezier-pushing maybe
    it&#39;s a good time to look closely at existing &#40;good&#41; designs first?
    Develop a grasp of how things balance. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Chris- Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have PDF capability.  I will check at school
    &#40;I am an AmeriCorps volunteer&#41; to see if someone has the software, but
    I don&#39;t know of any Acrobat writers at my disposal. <BR> <BR>Do you think
    the ball terminal of the j is too heavy, or is it the body?  And does the short
    ascender on the k make it too weak?  For h and i, is it more of a cramped flow
    &#40;spacing/metrics&#41; or are the glyph forms too heavy? <BR> <BR>Hrant - the
    purpose was to actually do something artistic, for once in my life.  And I never
    worried about the quantity of glyphs, it was just borne out of my process; If
    I got stuck, I&#39;d go and find some composite characters to make till inspiration
    hit. <BR> <BR>That said, what are the issues of structure and finish that you
    see being detrimental to the face as it currently stands?  Does it lack historical
    cohesiveness?  Is it more a matter of color and feel?  And more importantly, what
    do you mean by &#34;how things balance&#34;? <BR> <BR>PS, it was the fit of obsessiveness
    with type design that turned me on to it in the first place.

    <BR><i>That said, what are the issues of structure and finish that you see being
    detrimental to the face as it currently stands?</i> <BR>Being a first effort,
    you&#39;ve turned up many of the classic first time problems. Many of the issues
    turn up as a result of the constructed nature of your font &#40;ie. you&#39;ve
    borrowed the o to make the c, you&#39;ve borrowed the c to make the n, youve borrowed
    the n to make the h, and I don&#39;t know why she swollowed the fly.&#41; This
    is a very common way of doing things &#40;even among accomplished designers&#41;.
    With time you will learn how the constructed letters need to be &#42;fixed&#42;
    to look correct. Aside from that, consider first the following font-wide problem:
    <BR> <BR><i>Stoke Modulation:</i> This is the location and flow of the thicks
    and thins of your font. Kudos to you, the locations of thick and thin look pretty
    good, it&#39;s the consistent application of thick and thin that is a big issue

  body: I actually use the Font Creator Program &#40;<a href="http://www.high-logic.com"
    target="_blank">www.high-logic.com</a>&#41;, a native True Type editing tool,
    so I&#39;m directly manipulating the quadratic Bezier curves of my ttf file.  No
    PDF save option there.  I really am not the artist type.  I don&#39;t know what
    I&#39;d do with a tool like Illustrator.  Probably nothing - it&#39;d be so over
    my head. <BR> <BR>Hrant - I didn&#39;t take it personally, and I apologize if
    I sounded as such.  I just wanted you to know where I was coming from on this.
    <BR> <BR>Randy - that was incredibly helpful, and I am carving out some time to
    work with your suggestions.  Hopefully this evening will pan out.  As is, I thank
    everyone who has posted here.  You have inspired me and given me the guidance
    to continue working on this so that it becomes as good as it can. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    guys.  I&#39;ll post back as soon as I can implement most of this.  Hopefully,
    I&#39;ll find a PDF writer somewhere on campus by that time.
