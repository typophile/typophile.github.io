    thanks to the work of one specific printer, John Bell.\r\n\r\nHowever, as [[http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2008/01/long-s.html|this

    (and some other countries that also used Fraktur for some time) the demise of
    the long s apparently was an international phenomenon."

  body: "I should perhaps have elaborated a bit in my posting... some of what I read
    about the disappearance of the long s in other parts of Europe noted that Didot's
    typeface, and other modern typefaces, were designed without a long s.\r\n\r\nThus,
    when printers used a modern typeface, they were constrained to eschew the long
    s.\r\n\r\nPresent-day readers, of course, find the long s very annoying because
    it's confusingly similar to the letter f. But, naturally enough, we hesitate to
    conclude that people in the 18th Century felt the same way; instead, if we prefer
    what we're used to, no doubt they preferred what they were used to.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the fact that short s looks more like capital S and is more distinct from f (and
    can't be confused with any other lowercase letter instead) <em>is</em> an objective
    fact. Thus, I think it is not unreasonable or provincial to suspect that, even
    in the 18th Century when the long s was the rule, that a significant number of
    schoolchildren learning to read and write hated the long s and wished it would
    go away.\r\n\r\nAnd that many of them might even have carried that attitude into
    adulthood. (My mental picture has this being more likely to be the case in the
    lower socio-economic classes.)\r\n\r\nAnd so, suddenly, one has an explanation
    of <em>why</em> Scotch Roman conquered the typographic world (except for conservative
    Germany), sweeping beautiful Caslon and even beautiful Baskerville into the dust-bin.
    (Of course, it helped that the <em>early</em> Scotch Roman faces weren't too bad
    looking themselves.)\r\n\r\nIt wasn't that modern roman faces were so much better
    looking as typefaces that they made Baskerville and Garamond look ridiculous and
    dated. (Caslon, well...)\r\n\r\nNo. It was that whenever printers printed something
    in Caslon or even Garamond or Baskerville, they insisted (those were conservative
    and traditional times, after all) on putting that dang long s in all the time!
    So it was not a preference for modern letter forms so much as a <strong>distaste
    for the long s</strong>, I suspect, that drove the rapid adoption of Scotch Roman.\r\n\r\nAnd
    then, fifty to a hundred years later, when the Scotch Romans became anemic and
    condensed and hideous in form, Alexander Phemister designed his typeface, and
    Caslon got revived, and gradually the world emerged from the typographic wilderness
    and we got the Monotype revivals and Times Roman, and are now living happily ever
    after.\r\n\r\nFinally, a rational explanation for how the world got from the beautiful
    Romans of Jenson and Aldus to the horrid typography of the later 19th Century.
    Each step was rational at the time it was taken, and the main impetus was not
    any \"mischievous\" effect of Baskerville somehow inspiring Didot, it was Didot
    performing the invaluable service of getting rid of the long s along with the
    mischief he, rather than Baskerville, happened to be doing to his letter forms."

  body: "Modernization was a multi-dimensional affair, encompassing character shape
    (long s became obsolete, lining figures replaced oldstyle), type style, page layout,
    and document purpose  -- all of which are involved in the synergy of typography.\r\n\r\nAt
    the time (1819), Richard Austin attributed the modern letter to changes in technology
    (harder steel, smoother paper, blacker ink):\r\n\u201C\u2026it was judged expedient
    to re-model the alphabet to render \u2026 [letters] more agreeable to the improved
    state of printing\u2026\u201D "

  body: "So you don't think I've made a sensational discovery that will revolutionize
    how we understand the history of typography?\r\n\r\nBut you are quite right that
    improvements in printing technique stimulated innovation in type design. After
    all, this is very well known in the case of Baskerville: he designed his typeface
    to look its best under the conditions of the very high quality presswork he performed.\r\n\r\nAnd
    now that raises another question. Garamond and Bembo are in use today, and no
    one complains that they are unsuitable to offset printing or photocomposition.
    What was stopping the typefoundries of the day from making any subtle alterations
    to existing oldstyle types, therefore, that may have been needed to make them
    fit in to the new world of smoother paper, and \"kiss\" instead of \"sock\" impressions?\r\n\r\nOne
    thing about the modern letterforms was that with their severe straight lines,
    their shapes were simpler than those of the oldstyle letter. And this mattered
    because...\r\n\r\nLinn Boyd Benton hadn't invented the <strong>pantograph</strong>
    yet!\r\n\r\nSmoother paper fed a demand for mechanical perfection in letterforms
    - and mechanical perfection was easier to achieve with the modern style of letter
    because the punches were simpler to cut.\r\n\r\nYes, there were many complicated
    feedbacks going on. But I still suspect that the long s played a significant role
    in helping things along - and, because that was seemingly unrelated, it is something
    that historians would tend to miss... unless the relevant information is brought
    together, the way it was in the discussion in this thread."

  body: I heard an interview with one of the Google folks who worked on the nGrams
    project, on (USA) National Public Radio, and he couldn't stress enough that English-language
    results before 1800 were unreliable, due to low sample size (not a lot of books)
    and data pollution from mis-dated books (later books that were mis-dated, often
    because they were ABOUT the earlier time period and someone screwed up). I'm not
    saying that this affects the cool long-s graph. When playing around with nGrams,
    you'll often see wacky values in the earlier centuries.
