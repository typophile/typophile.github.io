  body: Well, maybe they just used the period from something else. The y, r, and e
    are spot-on for Arial.

    grotesk, as long as it looks ryte the exact face you use doesn't really matter.
    Whatever appeals to you. Add a round period if you really feel the need. Then
    tell the client to use their imagination.\r\n\r\nSince nobody here can identify
    the face in the sample with a 100% certainty score, the exact typeface cannot
    be any more significant, even to Typophiles, than \"Arial or something like it\".\r\n\r\nj

    doesn't make sense to me!"
