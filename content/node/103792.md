body: "Hi typopohile!\r\n\r\nI am working on a display block typeface that I started
  because I believe that no block-display type exists with full functionality.  For
  example baby teeth, the letters are great but the numbers arent so good, like the
  7, in my opinion of course.\r\n\r\nSeeing this I decided to propose a new system
  where I though it would be a good idea to make it mono-spaced, so it blocks even
  more, however it doesnt work with the Hebrew and Cyrillic alphabets.\r\n\r\nThe
  pdf that is attached shows what i have so far.  "

    yet, but expect something later.

  body: "I like where you're going with it, quirky, a little art deco. I agree with
    the other comments.\r\n\r\nOn the Hebrew: I think it is very angular and much
    less bold compared to the Latin and Cyrillic. You could try to be more elaborate
    with the shapes I think. I have no idea how readable this is, but I had toyed
    with the idea of Hebrew letter shapes like this a year or two ago.\r\n\r\nHere's
    an old sketch I did. You probably want to make sure to keep it heavy like the
    other scripts and also make sure you can read the letters. (My example my be a
    bit exaggerated here...)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/early_hebrew_sketch_3927.JPG]"

  body: "I also agree with the other comments!\r\nI really struggle with the white
    space in hebrew letters. Its really hard to get them into a system+make them readable.\r\nAlso
    I coudnt find any reference, do you know any?\r\n\r\nThanks for your sketch :)
    \r\nNow that i see yours, I realise what is missing in my type. It really need
    some more thinking.\r\n\r\nThank you again Bryan, you are really supportive!"

    can't remember where this image came from. The filename of the image is \"Aleph

    believe this is student work from a University class that Oded Ezer taught.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/odedezer_hit2_3414.gif]\r\n\r\nWith
