  body: Lots of interesting, undiscovered typefaces here, Lucia. Thank you! The movies
    are enjoyable, but I'd like to see samples of the fonts as well.

  body: "If you mind self-promotion, please look away...\r\n\r\nFor whoever might
    be interested: the current (I think) issue of Tiypo magazine (#12) features an
    interview of yours truly. The original interview was done a while ago, but it
    was updated; it is however only in Spanish. Except the illustrations. Those are...
    bilingual.  ;-)\r\n\r\nThere's also an interview of JFP, and the work of super-cool
    Super-Macho.\r\n\r\nThank you. As you were.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
