  like it was cut out of a perfect circle, but neither the O nor C take this shape
  in Helvetica or Helvetica Neue.  Or is that part custom?\r\n\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/CrateandBarrelLogo.svg/141px-CrateandBarrelLogo.svg.png"

    Avant Garde Demi</a>.

  body: The ends of the stroke in C seem to leave a tighter gap in the Crate and Barrel
    logo, though ITC Avant Garde Demi does look very close.  Thanks!
