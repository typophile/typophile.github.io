  Matters]] and some more...) to learn what makes a book legible and readable and
  \"nice\", and what doesn't.\r\n\r\nWhile all these reads were interesting and a
  huge learning opportunity (for a newbie in this field) I did miss elaborations on
  images and image placement, tables, and their respective subtitles.\r\n\r\nWhat
  are the general guidelines and recommendations with respect to size and placement
  of images and tables? How to flow text around them (if at all, I feel reluctant
  to do that) and where might I want to avoid them altogether?\r\n\r\nAny pointers,
  hints, and reading suggestions are welcome :-) Thanks!"

  body: "Firstly understand the difference between legibility and readability - the
    best short text on this - IMHO - is the section in Walter Tracy\u2019s \u2018Letters
    of Credit\u2019.  Some of the confusion over these topics by those who should
    have known better, can be better understood now as a result of the research of
    William Berkson & Peter Enneson in \u2018Readability: discovery and disputation\u2019
    - the retrieval of the reputation and research of Matthew Luckiesh (1883-1967)
    - in Typography Papers \xB7 9.\r\n\r\nEdward Tufte\u2019s classic \u2018The Visual
    Display of Quantitative Information\u2019 is a highly refined introduction to
    and exemplar of the presentation of non-text information and an appeal to eliminate
    unnecessary visual \u2018noise\u2019.\r\n\r\nBalance and selection are rarely
    given enough emphasis - images can easily overwhelm and undermine text, especially
    if they have their own extensive captions - the main text matter in many highly
    illustrated books are seldom ever read properly & people who have browsed the
    images will swear that they\u2019ve read the book! Keep to the text grid unless
    you are prepared to abandon it for a dramatically different page structure (eg.
    full bleed) in an inset.\r\n\r\nTschichold\u2019s \u2018On the Correlation of
    Text to Page Area\u2019 is the seminal text not only to understand the historic
    role of the grid, but demonstrates the common heritage and geometric logic of
    the ergonomics and perceptual balance of the double page spread both in its classic
    form but also as a congruent basis of asymetric layout on a page proportioned
    grid. Tschichold\u2019s classic book grid also generates a 9x9 proportional modernist
    page grid matrix - see below for construction - the crucial element is the resulting
    rectangle top left of the recto text area - an exact 1/9 x 1/9 page proportion
    grid unit. And it works for any page proportions giving you margins, text area
    and layout. Key to the scriptorum!\r\n\r\nPreserving sizes & stroke widths from
    the main text is a good aim, but a switch to a sans typeface with the flexibility
    of for example Univers for diagrams and labelling is a well established tradition.
    If you switch fonts in bodies of text - take the trouble to exactly match x-heights
    - something that almost cannot be done in letterpress but is almost trivial with
    digital fonts.\r\n\r\nThe Monotype Recorder on \u2018The Setting of Mathematics\u2019
    by Arthur Phillips (1956) is a one of a kind reference, if you should ever need
    it.  Some of the University Presses and their typographers have recognisable House
    Styles and Rules for dealing with tabular material and it\u2019s worth collecting
    your own annotated examples - I\u2019m a great believer in design by exception
    - follow good models as carefully as you can - correcting clear errors and only
    inventing new treatments when confronted with genuinely new materials not previously
    incorporated in the series style.\r\n\r\nSee the \u2018Book Design: Text Format
    Models\u2019 by Stanley Rice (Dec 1978) when designing your style architecture.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    asking good questions - borrow from past giants but always imagine personas for
    your readers and the circumstances of their reading - go deep and enjoy.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TschicholdGrid_3784.jpg]"

  body: "The treatment of captions is critical, as it provides a working bridge. between
    body text and images, that informs page layout.\r\n\r\nA lot depends on how much
    information, and in how many categories, is contained in the captions.\r\n\r\nBear
    in mind that many, if not most people, barely glance at pictures before reading
    captions.\r\n\r\nIMO, nothing is more annoying in a book than captions which are
    not right beside the images to which they refer, or not organized in a way that
    is consistent.\r\n\r\nI would suggest bookstore/library perusing of books similar
    in content to yours, identifying those with caption design which communicates
    promptly and ef\uFB01ciently to you, analyzing why, and adopting a similar strategy.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you, this all makes sense :)\r\n\r\nWith respect to images without
    captions but which are referred to by the text, I wonder about their placement
    on the page or spread. It seems to help when the images\u2019 dimensions align
    with, say, a 9x9 grid layout of the page but I am reluctant to flow text around
    images. I have always somehow disliked how this scatters text.\r\n\r\nThere are
    some hints in [[http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Books-Practice-Jost-Hochuli/dp/0907259235|Designing
    Books]] which helps.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tim:</strong> Thank you so much for all the
    tips, I found a few excerpts from [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Form-Book-Morality-Typography/dp/0881791164|The
    Form of the Book]]. The other references I've added to my list :)\r\n\r\n<strong>Nick:</strong>
    That's a good idea, I'll spend a day at the local library and poke around :)"

  body: "I know this was a long time ago - but I just wanted to endorse Nick\u2019s
    suggestion of going to look for good models - I am a huge advocate of design by
    exception - find a really good model for similar material and use its elements
    that work best - spend your precious creative time crafting the elements that
    are uniquely required by your new content that aren\u2019t already provide in
    your model ... check out the bible - Stanley Rice - Book Design: Text Format Models
