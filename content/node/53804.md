  needs to have an Organic and Moroccan feel to it and yet have a fresh...I haven't
  seen that before look to it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you all think of these two fonts together
  for that?\r\n\r\nAlso is it just me or is AuBauer tracked very haphasardly.\r\n\r\nthanks
  a million!"

  body: I know...I think it stems from my not wanting to go themey moroccan and that
    I also can't find a moroccan typeface that is not kitchy. Yes I agree it is a
