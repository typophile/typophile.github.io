  sailing on Saturday and I noticed they have began to blister. Does anyone have any
  tips on treating these? I'm already applying vitamin e gel every few hours."

  body: You can refrigerate the gel to provide a momentary cooling sensation when
    it is applied. Apply the gel thickly and frequently to provide maximum comfort.

  body: Fresh Aloe Vera sap/juice is great for this. It'll cool it down and heal the
    burn as well. I've never heard of anyone being allergic, but might be best to
    do a small test on your wrist first... good luck

  body: "I would probably mix some topical aloe vera with some cortisone cream, and
    augment it with a codeine pill. I always keep my prescriptions for misc. things
    like that. I am a baby when it comes to pain. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Seek advice
    from a trained physician before trying any of my lame-brained cockamamie remedies.\r\n;
