body: "Hi,\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prob_3470.png]\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  come across a bug in iOS causing rendering errors with Postscript flavoured fonts.
  Some characters are rendered lighter than others in landscape mode (subpixels),
  but when you zoom in or switch to portrait mode (greyscale) they appear correctly
  again. Tim Brown (edit: Tim Ahrens) over at Typekit looked into the issue with the
  font in question (I\u2019ve only tested Mobile Safari on iPad, but Tim also sees
  these problems on the iPod):\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nI think you have discovered a rather
  weird bug in the iOS type rendering engine. I can reproduce this and have tried
  to figure out what exactly it is that causes the problem. It must be in the actual
  outline drawings of the letters in question, not the hinting, features or any other
  font metadata.\r\nIt seems that the rasterizer is not 100% numerically stable and
  runs into problems when certain constellations of nodes and BCPs occur. It is difficult
  to pin down exactly what these constellations are, which is not too surprising considering
  it is a bug.\r\nI had a closer look at the v, which rendered strangely on my iPod.
  After a bit of playing around, it turned out that tweaking one curve is enough to
  make it render correctly (see the arrow on the attached image). Looking at this
  example, and how the other glyphs are drawn, I suspect that it could be related
  to \"retracted\" BCPs, although in some cases, they don't seem to cause any problems.
  I personally also work with retracted BCPs a lot and I am not aware of any rule
  or convention that forbids this. That said, the only fix I can think of right now
  would be to \"extract\" the BCPs.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/-1_5755.png]\r\n\r\nHave
  anyone else experience this? Can someone shed any light?\r\n"

    have the same BCP configuration, like the 'v' in the close-up here, while only
    the diagonals have the rendering problems, right? That makes no sense at all,
    does it? \r\n\r\nI think it's a highly unsatisfactory solution having to redefine
    all the serifs because of this, as this practice is not in any way non-standard.
    (At least, Font Audit does not think it is.) People need to write better renderers. "

    you may want to test with it."
