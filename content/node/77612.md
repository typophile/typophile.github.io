  of fonts and nice pointy style. I'd ideally would like to buy individual fonts to
  start and build it up to the full set as I require. Verlag is over \xA3300 which
  is very reasonable. However currently I can't cover it at the moment with other
  sets needed for my latest project. I have Neautraface and could get Neautra 2 which
  is a similar but has the less stylistic nuances. Can you suggest any others or is
  Verlag or Neautraface the best option?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDan"

    could be nice as well but has a limited range of styles. And Erbar even less unfortunately
    (only bold condensed)."

    faces. The others again not enough faces. Any other suggestions welcome!

    are looking for.\r\n\r\nAlso look into Mostra, Insignia, Eagle, Le Havre, Geometric
    415, PT Sans, possibly Brandon Grotesque and Bernhard Gothic.  You may even like
    Marlowe, but its weights are limited."

  body: Have you looked at Jim Parkinson's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/richmond/|Richmond]]?
    I don't think it is available in Opentype but you can buy individual fonts from
    the family.
