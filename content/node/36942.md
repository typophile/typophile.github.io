  can enlarge it in a photo editing program if you wish, albeit with some major blur.

  body: "Hmmmm...\r\n\r\nThe ITC version displays the curved crossbar on cap \"T\"
    and the sample you show has a straight T as offered in URW verstion... plus cap
    \"A\" curve right. The original ITC Busorama had plenty of alternates, not sure
    if either digital version does.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/busorama_ITC_4784.png]"
