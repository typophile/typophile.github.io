body: "Hi, I need some advice on what to charge for a logo.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I work
  as a graphic designer/retoucher for a beauty products company and a couple of my
  fellow employees are branching out to create their own eco-friendly beauty/skincare
  products. Their idea is to make an affordable, yet high-quality \"green\" beauty
  product. They approached me to design their logo. Eventually, this may turn into
  a full-scale identity project where I would design the packaging, be involved with
  or take product photography, etc. For now they need a logo as part of their presentation
  to potential financial backers.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I've done freelance
  work, and even then it was primarly non-logo related- illustration, posters, CD
  covers, etc.- so I'm not too keen on what I should charge.\r\n\r\nI want to give
  them a fair price, make some money for myself, but at the same time not break their
  bank if their idea doesn't go anywhere.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be helpful. Thanks."

    you're in the UK (as a starter) and you want to build up a good working relationship
    with them for future work, maybe it's best to do a deal where you provide 3 logo
    ideas, based on what they're looking for, for maybe \xA3100 - \xA3150.  If they
    have no idea what they're looking for, chances are no matter how good the logo
    you may design, it may well not be 'what they imagined', so I'd say it's important
    to try and get as much info from them as possible.  If they can't give you an
    idea I'd say you'd have to then say that each additional design would have to
    be \xA350 a time unless they can then give you some idea of direction.  It's quite
    realistic to claim that they'd be paying a lot more than this for other companies'
    services.\r\nLogo/corporate ID can be quite lucrative work.  You can see the fees
    that some online companies charge.\r\n\r\nHope that helps, but I'll just say that's
    how I'd approach it, although some others here may disagree with me."

    Handbook of Pricing and Ethical Guidelines</em>, it gives a lot of detailed information
    on logo pricing.\r\n\r\nIf I were you I would avoid giving them a rock bottom
    rate just to establish a business relationship. Doing so devalues the entire design
    trade, but it would also put you in a situation where you are allowing friends
    to take advantage of you for next to no money, which is a good way to sour a friendship.
    If they really can\u2019t afford a designer, do design work in exchange for a
    small stake in the business\u201450 Cent made hundreds of millions of dollars
    from plugging Vitamin Water that way!"

    charge $40/hour start to finish. I try to handle clients (which come via a generally
    friendly network) with the Jedi mastery of Obi Wan Kenobi: \"These aren't the
    droids you're looking for...\"; i.e. \"I am giving you what you want.\" And usually
    things go very smoothly. This also requires a good amount of good question asking
    up front, careful listening (best with beer), and common-sense problem solving.
    I deliver a very functional, better-than-not-designed-by-a-designer logo for anywhere
    from $100-$400. Some people think that's a lot, some people think it's too cheap.
    I serve a very small rural community. I'm sure it might be a completely different
    story for metropolitan folk, or if you intend to jockey for position on the world
    wide web.\r\n"

  body: You may note that the above mentioned GAG handbook suggests tiered pricing
    based on what the organization makes. I think you can look at friend deals differently,
    depending on what sort of friends you make. Sometimes I will negotiate a bit on
    price if they will follow me in choosing better materials.

  body: "Asking what random people on the internet charge isn't going to really help
    you in any way.\r\n\r\nThe way to figure out how much to charge is to first figure
    out what you'd need to charge if you were on your own full time doing this for
    a living. From there, you can adjust accordingly based on your situation, but
    without that baseline calculation, you're just throwing darts.\r\n\r\nThe question
    is:\r\n\r\ntotal cash inflow needed per year / # billable hours per year = your
    minimum hourly rate\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nYour total cash inflow includes your salary
    and ALL expenses (software, hardware, desks, furniture, electriciy, phone, internet,
    books, insurance, travel, education, fonts,  etc, etc, etc)\r\n\r\nyour # billable
    hours per year is NOT the same as # hours you work per year. As a freelancer,
    a lot of those working hours will be non-billable. You might decide to work a
    40 hour week, but odds are that only 20-30 of those hours are actually billable.
    Don't forget to calculate for vacation and sick time as well.\r\n\r\nOnce you
    do all that math, you'll find your baseline price. Then you can adjust accordingly
    based on factors like work load, the client, your expertise/skillset, etc.\r\n\r\n\"you
    want to build up a good working relationship with them for future work\"\r\n\r\nAgreed,
    but (IMHO) lowballing your first gig is NOT a good way to build that relationship.
    It sets unrealistic expectations and devalues your work--ESPECIALLY if these are
    friends, as both parties will, by default, tend to allow a lot to slip by that
    one would normally not tolerate in a business relationship.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think Aluminum is quite correct. Additionally, if you do not have, or are
    not planning to have, a full-time design business to operate, then you really
    should worry less about the absolute market value of your work and more about
    finding a price that both you and they are happy with. They have a variety of
    options open to them \u2014 from doing it themselves, to having a nephew do it
    for free, to having the designer at work take it on as a side project, to hiring
    an established design firm or ad agency, etc. \u2014 just as you have other options
    for how you spend your free time. So if everybody is satisfied with the terms,
    the project is more likely to go well and the friendship more likely to survive
    it. Irrespective of what the market is charging, be fair to yourself and work
    out the price with them.\r\nI would only add that the offer/promise of future
    work seems to be something that clients mention instinctively in order to press
    the price down. As a general rule, I would not allow it to influence the price
    you set for each individual project. You'll address their being a repeat customer
    if and when it happens."

    Excellent point! Stores don't give you price breaks for the potential future purchases
    you make. Instead, they give you discounts when those future purchases actually
    happen (ie, coupons, frequent buyer cards, annual rewards, etc.)"

  body: "Thanks for the responses.\r\n\r\nI guess I was looking for a range of numbers
    to refer to for a startup business. BTW, I'm located in New York City (expensive)
    and will keep that in mind with my fees.\r\n\r\nI agree that I should not lowball
    my fee. Most of my freelance experience, outside of interacting with other creatives,
    has been one where I give my fee and I get that dead stare into space look. It
    seems alot of people think anyone with Word can design a logo and owning Photoshop
    makes you a designer.\r\n\r\nLuckily, my co-workers understand the importance
    of design, know the quality I can give them and realize there is more to designing
    than a few clicks of the mouse. I'll refer to a recent edition of the Guild handbook,
    present my number with an expectation of possible negotation and go from there. "
