  Something should have been done about this years ago.  Webmail should have it also.  I
  should be able to upload my desired fonts and type on the member participation websites.  This
  feature is important to have on text editors / text fields and should be implemented
  immediately.  Once this feature is used then if particular websites have a policy
  about what fonts  users can upload, they could state it.     '

  body: You have no clue what you are talking about. First, there is no reason that
    a font installed on your computer needs to be uploaded to a server for you to
    be able to use it in web applications provided by said server. Second, desktop
    font licenses are not multiuser server licenses. If a service vendors wants to
    license a font for use on a server with web applications then they are free to
    do so; this does not give you the right to install fonts you licensed for desktop
    use on servers. Third, this has absolutely nothing to do with a monopoly. You
    do not know what a monopoly is and need to go back and study monopolies and antitrust
    before you throw that word around again.

  body: "I don't think embedding the fonts in the text is practical or even desirable.
    Fonts should be linked the same way images should be linked. Otherwise you have
    an insurmountable barrier: rebuilding the web to allow fonts binaries to be embedded
    with text on all web forums and web-mail apps.\r\n\r\nWarning: I'm not involved
    in technical aspects of font embedding. What follows is pure fantasy.\r\n\r\nHosted
    fonts (like Typekit) could allow for \"anywhere\" use. If you used the font on
    a web forum, unique code (maybe inline CSS?) could be included which links to
    the hosted font so it appears to all users. This code would be sent to the font
    host and it would correlate with the users's account. How do you prevent someone
    else from using the CSS to write their own messages other other web forums using
    the same font? A unique code would be generated for each instance. The code would
    be based on the words in the text itself (like a CRC check). Maybe a browser extension
    could take care of the details so the user wouldn't have to deal with the technical
    aspects. If the user is logged into their \"font account\", they could generate
    the proper code which would allow then to use the font they paid for. Other users
    could copy/paste the text and the fonts would still show up. If the text is modified,
    the CRC check fails and the font won't display. This would allow you to buy a
    font license, use the font in webmail, on forums etc.\r\n\r\nOf course, every
    site you use the fonts on would have to allow this type of code to be included.
    Browsers would have to be allow this type of use and users would have to upgrade
    their browsers. \"Implemented immediately\" is impossible.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly\">Monopoly</a>
    doesn't apply to this situation. There's no big font company in charge of font
    embedding that's preventing this. Font embedding is the result of lots of individuals,
    organizations and companies innovating and trying to get fonts on the web. Browsers
    makers are slow to improve but that's not a monopoly either."

  body: "@javascript: In another thread, you have said \"I expressed / proposed clean
    non-dirty law abiding development without any font piracy\", but in that case,
    it's unclear what the point of your posting in this thread is.\r\n\r\nOf course
    DRM creates problems for law-abiding users of fonts, music, or whatever. But it's
    there in order to prevent piracy. So to just say that it should be done away with,
    to condemn it as bad, as monopolistic, without addressing the issue of piracy
    - even if to note that piracy from websites using fonts is not a real threat at
    present, because there are other wider avenues for piracy - creates the impression
    that one is, at the least, indifferent to piracy.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to uploading
    fonts to \"member participation websites\", there's another obvious issue. Just
    because you would be uploading fonts which are legitimate doesn't mean that someone
    else, unaware of copyright, wouldn't upload a font which is copyrighted... and
    create liability issues for the website operator.\r\n\r\nPreventing losing money
    to piracy, preventing getting in trouble from being blamed for the piracy of others
    - these things are the top priorities. It doesn't make <em>sense</em> to complain
    about that; of course the world revolves around money a little bit too much, but
    money is the means of survival, so what else can you possibly expect?"

  body: "Well, the word \"binaries\" is a technical term. It means files like the
    ones on your computer that end in .EXE or .COM for computer programs. You can
    run the programs, but you can't read them; the files contain the actual pattern
    of bits that will be placed in the computer's memory - possibly with instructions
    for relocation or linkage. (Actually, files like that are more likely to end in
    .OBJ, and for arcane technical reasons, while other computers had operating systems
    that did relocation and linkage when you ran a program, MS-DOS and Windows do
    without this flexibility, using other methods to link programs to external libraries.)\r\n\r\nThe
    other kind of file that isn't a binary file is a \"text\" file. In the case of
    a program, that would be the source code - written in C, Pascal, BASIC, Assembler,
    or some other programming language.\r\n\r\nSo the \"binary\" is the final product
    - the program, or the font, all wrapped-up and ready for use... but not intended
    to be modified by the end-user. (In the case of fonts, though, while .TTF files
    are binary, they are what font editors work on; a font editor may have its own
    file format too, but there really isn't a \"source code\" format for fonts.)"

    do it the way some old mainframe systems did it: reading in a directive in the
    .EXE file which says to replace certain addresses in the machine code it contains
    with the memory addresses of entry points in the external library (which would
    have to have been loaded into memory first).\r\n\r\nInstead, a very different
    mechanism is used which requires the program in the .EXE to take care of setting
    up the links itself during its own execution."

  body: "quadibloc: <em>Of course DRM creates problems for law-abiding users of fonts,

    Rights Management involves technical mechanisms to restrict use of digital content,
    e.g. to a particular user, with stiff legal penalties in some jurisdictions for
    circumventing such mechanisms. The minor protections available to fonts on the
    web do not constitute DRM; indeed, the majority of browser makers made it very
    clear that they were not willing to consider DRM for fonts. Fonts are protected
    by legal licensing terms, not by technical mechanisms."
