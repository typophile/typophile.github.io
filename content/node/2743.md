body: For some reason I can&#39;t figure out what this font is and I know once I find
  out it will be one of those &#34;DUH&#34; moments. I know it&#39;s a common font
  I would usually know, but I seem to have forgotten to grease the brain wheels. Thanks
  for your assistance. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24356.jpg"

  body: 'Yep, I knew it. One of those old standbys I&#39;ve had for years. It&#39;s
    always the easy ones that seem to allude me. I had a motherboard go bad and I
    only reinstalled the fonts for the projects was I working currently. Thanks for
    the quick response guys! :'
