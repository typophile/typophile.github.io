  and Univers Condensed. It all works \u2013 great.\r\nHowever the client s not willing
  to boy the 100+ licenses to get the fonts onto it employees computers for daily
  use on stationary etc.\r\nSo now I am looking for a substitute that ships with the
  standard Windows 7 package and resembles Univers and Univers Condensed as closely
  as possible. Unfortunately I am working on a Mac so I don\u2019t have access to
  the entire Windows 7 library to try it out myself.\r\nAnyone have any ideas, maybe
  even faced a similar issue in the past?\r\nAny tips or recommendations are highly
  appreciated"

    at least for testing. You can't ignore 90% of the computing world.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    architecture', that is.
