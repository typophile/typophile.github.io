  a newbie to Open Type so before I go any further, I want to test this feature in
  Microsoft Word but am having little success.  I have written, compiled and installed
  a test font which should replace &#39;ff&#39; with &#39;g&#39;. <BR> <BR>feature
  liga { # Standard Ligatures  <BR># Latin  <BR>sub f  f  by  g;  <BR>} liga;  <BR>
  <BR>This compiles and works in the FontLab Preview window but not in Word 2002 or
  2003. <BR>I have exported as an OT font and loaded into Windows. <BR>The font operates
  apart from the automatic Ligature. <BR>Any suggestions gratefully received.'

  body: Ian,  <BR> <BR>OpenType features work in applications that support them. Microsoft
    applications currently officially only support OpenType features for &#34;complex
    writing systems&#34; &#40;Arabic, Devanagari etc.&#41;. In Windows XP &#42;&#42;Service
    Pack 2&#42;&#42;, there is undocumented and unofficial support for ligatures in
    Notepad and some other applications that use the Microsoft Uniscribe library.  <BR>
    <BR>Microsoft plans to add system-wide support for OpenType features in the new-generation
    Windows codenamed Longhorn that will perhaps be released in 2006. Other vendors
    &#40;e.g. Apple or Quark&#41; may also be adding OpenType features support.  <BR>
    <BR>But currently, the only major applications that make use of the OpenType features
    for Latin glyphs are those from the Adobe Creative Suite series &#40;InDesign,
    Illustrator, Photoshop&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam
