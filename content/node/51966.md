    but do you think something like this, able to reflow text dynamically, could ever
    get even close to human set type?\r\n"

  body: '@Frode: I think that this has the potential to exceed the quality newspaper
    typography, where good typesetting is not always possible due to time and space
    constraints. Going digital lessens the space constraints, and I see that as a
    big plus.'

    and shows up in an AIR-like app on your desktop ecaxtly how they want it to.  Instead
    of a browser, you'll need like an iTunes for sorting or managing sites you go
    to and have bookmarked.\r\n\r\nAbout reading the newspaper online, I think this
    is far better than current online news websites, but the biggest question is -
    should I choose to print an article, how would it print for me?"
