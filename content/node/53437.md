    Berthier or Pingdom logos depending which industry you are closer to.

    have a web presence. I have some more sketches I'll mock-up and post soon. Any
    suggestions for what would make the logo more unique and or memorable? color?
    style? Or were you thinking more - scrap it and head in a whole new direction?\r\n\r\n-j"

  body: '#4 in this latest round is perhaps the closest in encapsulating the concept
    of "pebble" in form - but how does this tie into supporting artists? Your designs
    seem to be lacking concept - what''s the key idea that you want to communicate?
    Why does the org call themselves "pebble"? Put more conceptual thinking behind
    the design. As others have stated previously, these designs seem pretty generic.'

  body: 'Pebble helps artists through lots of tiny donations. So a lot of tiny things
    are adding up to help a larger need for each artist. I agree that the logo looks
    generic, but what might give it an edge that makes it memorable. I think #5 is
    my favorite so far for the obvious reason that lots of tiny things are adding
    up to accomplish a larger goal. I just thought of another idea I could try out.
    Thanks for the help!'

  body: Plus they look like bubbles not pebbles. See if you can make the p with no
    more than 30 irregular shapes. What I would do is print a fine outline of the
    p in a faint colour and draw the pebble fill-in by hand.
