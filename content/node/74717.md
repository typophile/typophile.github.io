  body: This is do to rounding errors of anything beyond 2 decimal places.  FL keeps
    the unit raster in all drawing so when you scale down, the fractional widths are
    rounded up or down, sometimes with bad results.

  body: "Moshik, \r\n\r\nmake sure that your glyphs are scaled properly before you
    start to work with FontLab Studio. All font formats are based on an integer grid,
    so FontLab Studio implements it rigorously. Fontographer does not, so you can
    work with fractional coordinates during the design process, but your coordinates
    will be rounded to integers when you generate the font. You can open a .vfb file
    in Fontographer 5, do your scaling there, export a .vfb and open it in FontLab
    Studio again. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
