  i turned one of the letters on it's side, i noticed it's interesting \"okatsim\"*
  that are similar or were inspired by latin serifs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6223.jpg]\r\n\r\n*
  \"oketz\" is the hebrew term for something like serifs, only in the upper end of
  the letter, as seen in this picture:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-11_3591.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nmy
  question is something like this:\r\nwhat kind of fonts(english i mean) have these
  kind of serifs?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What you circled resembles a slab serif with some bracketing, such as you
    find on faces like Clarendon, though the serifs are normally parallel or perpendicular
    to the baseline, not angled or curved like your example. \r\nI hope this is a
    useful reply. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clarendon_3508.gif]"

  body: "kudos for the slab serif, but i think that the original typeface is much
    more rigid (when looking at the bigger picture.\r\ni agree with you about the
    parallel thing. \r\n\r\nbtw, the original \"serif\" (we shall call it like that)
    has a slightly cut end.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-11

  body: "I read somewhere that Friedlaender was consciously trying to get the feeling
    of Jenson in his type, so it's not surprising that there's some echo in the shapes,
    and the modulation of line. So the answer to your question I think is: Jenson.
    \r\n\r\nThe story of Hadassah, which is as you say one of the great Hebrew types,
    is incredibly moving. He was a student of the great Rudolph Koch in Germany, but
    moved to Holland when the Nazis took over in Germany. He started work on what
    would become Hadassah in Holland. When the Nazis took over, he buried his drawings,
    but continued to work on it in hiding for nearly three years in an attic, while
    fed and protected by his non-Jewish wife. He survived and after the war he dug
    up the drawings, emigrated to Israel and completed it there. \r\nInfluential type
    teacher Gerrit Noordzij says he was responsible for making what became KABK \"letter
    friendly\" and so to hire Noordzij.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1991/LB-N91-Fontaine.html|Here's
    an extensive description of the development of Hadassah]], with a nice bibliography
    at the end. You should be able to get a hold of his book in Hebrew in Israel,
    where he also taught.  \r\n\r\nOne of the heroes of type, in my book. \r\n\r\nps,
    I edited this to add the link, so it got out of order. "

  body: they seem close, but the serifs are quite different. and jenson is less rigid.

  body: 'I think the issue is inspiration rather than imitation. Also remember that
    the original Jenson--and I''m sure Friedlaender saw photos, and maybe originals--is
    not the same as Slimbach''s Adobe Jenson, as beautiful as that is.  '
