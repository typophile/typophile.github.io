  the good contemporary fonts are coming from. There are enough books written about
  the past that I think I'm covered there.\r\n\r\nSo ... it's probably a matter of
  opinion, but is anyone willing to voice their opinion on, let's say, their top 5?
  \r\n\r\nIt'd be a huge help."

      design, Rem Koolhaus / Bruce Mau style mockups; I've got a good stable of classic
      and sophisticated sans and serifs, and am looking for something with a bit more
      contemporary relevance and energy to complement. Reason: the 'client' is an
      organization that is founded on the bleeding edge of technological and academic

    it sounds like Ryan is looking for original sources, which probably means foundries,
    not resellers. Thus, MyFonts and Veer would not apply. Most of the others listed
    are indeed original sources of fonts, whose wares are often sold through distributors
    such as MyFonts, Veer, Phil's, and FontShop."

    I would argue that [[Veer]] does apply - at least in terms of being considered
    a foundry. The [[Jukebox]] collection is a Veer product, seeing as [[Jason Walcott]]
    produces new typefaces under contract to us specifically for Jukebox. Whether
    or not Jukebox can be considered a <em>hot foundry</em> given the aforementioned
    criteria, is certainly a debatable point.\r\n\r\nPersonally, along with many of
    the foundries mentioned already, I've been finding the work of Neil, Silas, Dino
    & Co. over at <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/\">The Type Trust</a> as hot
    as anything on my radar."
