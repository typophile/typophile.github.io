  flyers featuring the fonts from my favourite \"quality\" beers. Pabst and Budweiser.\r\n\r\nHere
  is what i was wondering if anyone could identify\r\n\r\n1. What font \"Pabst\" is
  written in? I know it's probably hand rendered, but does anyone know anything similar?\r\n2.
  What font \"Blue Ribbon\" is.\r\n3. I like this old style Bud can. Trying to identify
  the \"Budweiser\" letters as well as the script text that says..\"Brewed by our
  original...\"\r\n\r\nThanks for any help. I heard you folks are the best at identifying
  ANY font!?"

    they're still using it!\r\n\r\n(God, I have horrible memories of PBR in college

    sure that  \"Pabst\" is custom lettering but would love to see the font if there
    is one.\r\n\r\nPBR is actually pretty good on tap now 'days. "
