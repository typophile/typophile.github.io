    fonts out there, so this will either  <BR>be a lucky shot or an unsolved mystery.
    No luck yet.

  body: Jenkins is similar, but the lc a is wrong.  I believe <a href="http://fonts.ontheweb.com/fonts/rays___1.html">Rays
    hand</a> a.k.a. <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/HWFontAliases.html">Mook</a>
    is what you are looking for.  Sorry I couldn&#39;t find a better sample or reference
    on the web.

    on alt.binaries.fonts just the other day, so I had seen it recently.

  body: Yves-san, <BR> <BR>&#34;Haiku-poems consist of respectively 5, 7 and 5  <BR>syllables
    in three units. In Japanese, this convention  <BR>is a must, but in English, which
    has variation in the  <BR>length of syllables, this can sometimes be difficult.&#34;
