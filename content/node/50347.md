body: "Okay, I get the difference between a Bold face and an Extra Bold, but where
  exactly does a \"Black\" fit into the grand scheme of a font?  Every time I think
  I have sussed out what the definable difference might be I run into a font that
  breaks \"the rule.\"\r\n\r\nApologies to all who'll say that I should just choose
  what works/looks best. But, I'm the picky type who likes to understand the small
  stuff."

    sequence that appears in the first Font Info panel of FontLab, so it represents
    something of a standard, as this is what a lot of type designers and font developers
    go by.\r\n\r\nHowever, it should be pointed out that when one of these is selected,
    Fontlab assigns a numerical weight value from 100 to 1000 (in increments of 100)
    to the font, so several of the weights share the same number."

  body: Font weight definitions seem to be quite subjective and there's all sorts
    of ambiguity about where one weight ends and another begins. I guess what I'm
    saying is that there is no hard rule.

  body: I was going to propose "InfraLight" as a better candidate for that end of
    the spectrum, but I guess the world doesn't need yet another label added to the
    mix!

  body: "Personally, I've always felt that DemiBold was slightly bolder than Semibold
    and that Heavy was heavier than Black, but not as much as Ultra. Florian is right,
    ExtraBlack would come between Black and Ultra. UltraBlack is redundant. Fat just
    doesn't belong. \r\n\r\nAll completely subjective, of course.\r\n\r\n(Craig --
    I like InfraLight!)\r\n\r\n-- K."

    inconsistency -- tho, that is the kind of thing that'll keep me up at night,  :-)\r\n\r\nOkay!
    I'm off to post another question.\r\n\r\nThanks again!  Jim\r\n\r\ni wish i knew

  body: Black weights are sometimes narrower and have even smaller counters than bold
    or super/ultra weights, so they sort of sidestep most schemes. Take a look at
    FF Unit to see what I mean.

  body: For full symmetry, "Infra" should be lighter than "White". (There have been
    a few fonts that use "White").

    no real rules. Do grip the convention, but not too tightly.

  body: "\"Font weight definitions seem to be quite subjective and there\u2019s all
    sorts of ambiguity...\"\r\nI think weight names are only valuable relative to
    the family a style is in, as are the OS/2 values Nick refers to. The actual weights,
    expressed in units/units per em could be used across families to some extent,
    but in general, with selection for use being accomplished visually by humans,
    the only ones left in the dark are the computers.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
