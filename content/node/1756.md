  body: ' Dear Mr Kid, <BR>Great enthusiasm - having a feeling is the best foundation.
    <BR> <BR>There are many knowledgable people on this forum who can point you to
    some wonderful online sources - I&#39;d just like to point out three indispensable
    books that come to mind: &#34;Anatomy of a Typeface&#34; by Alexander Lawson,
    &#34;The Elements of Typographic Style&#34; by Robert Bringhurst, and &#34;Letters
    of Credit&#34; by Walter Tracy. There are many others, but for me these tend to
    stand out. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    &#40;although you may be <BR>ready for that&#41; I&#39;ll recommend a more basic  <BR>primer,
    &#34;Stop Stealing Sheep&#34; by Erik  <BR>Spiekermann &#40;from Adobe Press&#41;.
    This takes  <BR>a look at typography as it relates to the larger  <BR>picture
    of graphic design, whereas  <BR>Bringhurst&#39;s book is better suited as an  <BR>indepth
    reference. <BR> <BR>&#40;Or as the biblical addage puts it, milk before  <BR>meat.&#41; '
