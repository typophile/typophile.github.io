  body: "hi,\r\n\r\nif you need it for a wordmark as well, simply build it yourself
    using some tweaked around paths and a thick outline - \r\n\r\nit's pretty simply
    to achieve..\r\n\r\nprobably a matter of minutes rather then hours; it does not
    look very elaborated..\r\n\r\nif you need more letters, get your imagination going
    :)\r\n\r\nif you need it as a font, good luck finding it - maybe someone else
    can help.. but probably those are custom designed letters for a wordmark. i agree
    with jan.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nsteffen"
