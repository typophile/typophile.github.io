    I suspect some customization based on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger|Frutiger]]
    (yeah... crazy :) though. Some ready-to-go options: [[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Prokyon_rdrct.html|Prokyon]],
    [[http://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/karbon|Karbon]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/daxline|Daxline]],

    Sans</a>. \xBBMotor\xAB is plain Gill Sans and the \xBBB\xAB from Barloworld looks
    quite like a bold Gill Sans. And as the telephone Nr. is plain Arial, I think
    the creator has used only built in typefaces and started to modify. "
