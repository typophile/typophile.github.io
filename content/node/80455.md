body: "This is my first post. I spent about 30 minutes looking through various posts
  and this is an interesting place. I am an independent author and taught myself the
  basics of typography to self publish and not appear too amateurish. I also do my
  own graphic design on my website, business cards, letter head, and anything for
  my business.\r\n\r\nPreviously I have purchased Adobe CS suite with a huge font
  pack through an educational discount, and I use Indesign, Photoshop, Word and Powerpoint
  for 99% of my work involving fonts.  If I use a special font in web design, I do
  it in photoshop and upload it as an image file.\r\n\r\nI'd be lying if I said I
  had time/interest to really get deep into this subject. It seems like most here
  do this professionally and I already have multiple jobs.  I would, however, like
  to avoid looking like an amateur, as much as possible. Reading through The Elements
  of Typography has helped me format my writing better, and I am now very much aware
  of orphans/widows and kerning.\r\n\r\nMy reason for this post is to solicit advice
  on pruning down my font collection. Searching this forum and reading the wiki has
  shown me what a good basic font collection looks like, but I dont know enough about
  this subject to make good decisions based on that.\r\n\r\nI have about 800 fonts
  installed on my Mac laptop, and it's virtually impossible for me to find browse
  through when thinking of a font to use for a mini project.  I think if I had closer
  to 100 to 200 fonts, it would be a lot easier.  More so, if I learned to break them
  down into different classifications.  I read a few post on sorting and the only
  thing I know is the difference between Serif and Sans Serif.\r\n\r\nI have a bunch
  of \"free\" fonts that I downloaded off random sites. I believe they are legit,
  non-stolen, just user created fonts.  Some look good to me, but after reading some
  posts on here, I am learning that a lot of these are crap, and will look amateurish
  to use. Any recommendation on reading? The wiki and most forum posts are way over
  my head so I think I need to start with something more basic.\r\n\r\nWhat should
  I do with my fonts?  I'd be willing to spend a few hours reading/learning more about
  fonts if it will lead to a lifetime of useful basic knowledge. Is there a list of
  about 150 or so fonts that would make a reasonable setup for a non-power user?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    lists, especially those aggregated on the internet, are decidedly historical.\r\nClassical
    and conservative perhaps, but an easy step to developing taste.\r\n\r\nYou could
    start by going through your library and classifying according to Bringhurst, and
    then pruning each category to those you best like the look of -- favoring those
    which have \"expert\" features such as small caps and figure variants.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
