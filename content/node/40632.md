body: "I am very much a beginner at any graphics oriented stuff.  I am trying to put
  together marketing material for a new company (logo, brochures, website) and am
  finding it much more difficult than I imagined.  It all looks easy until you try
  to put one together.  Also the foudner of the company is stuck on oranges and reds
  for everything.  Please help me out. My logos have been all over the place adn when
  I found one I liked I realized it wasnt usable on colored backgrounds.  Learning
  slowly.  VERY SLOWLY!  SO if its really horrible, just tell me its horrible.  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Keep in mind that you will need to make a black and white version for situations
    in which you can't use full color (for example, in a fax).\r\n\r\nAlso, it looks
    like you are using Arial... Please, don't use Arial. So many great san serifs
    out there! Also, pick a typeface that has a wider range of weights... The two
    weights you are using in \"EKT Group\" are not different enough from each other.\r\n\r\nIn
    the second example, the \"M\" overlapping the orange circle doesn't look very
    good, because it's just the tip... It looks like an unwanted accident. Consider
    aligning \"Managing Success\" in some other way, rather than centering it exactly
    the same as in the first example."

  body: "Sans isn't the name of a font, it's a classification type in typography meaning
    a type without the small features called \"serifs\" at the end of strokes.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif\r\n\r\nI
    use Corel and the font selection is based off of your regular library of fonts,
    so there should be more then one Sans."

  body: "your logos are heavy on style effects and low on concept. It's easy to fall
    into the trap of adding a few photoshop filters here and trendy widget there.\r\n\r\nI'd
    step back a bit and work conceptually for a while. Sketch out some ideas...no
    matter how crazy you might think they are, and then look at them and see if if
    an idea begins to sprout."

  body: Also I am downloading some sans fonts.  Are there any in particular you recommend
    for logo use?

  body: If you're downloading free fonts, they are (probably) not well made.  There
    are a million sans out there, ten million ways to use them well, and ten billion
    ways to use them poorly.  I think that you need to educate yourself and your employer
    here, because there's not much we can do to help you without doing the work for
    you.  There's a reason that it is a professional skill.  It's hard.  It takes
    practice and education and sacrifice.  If you had more experience, I'd be more
    encouraging.  But I strongly suggest you hire a professional.
