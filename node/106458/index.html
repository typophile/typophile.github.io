  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Proliferation of type has been a controversial topic since Massimo Vignelli&rsquo;s Big Think interview in 2010. I was just wondering what people make of programmes like OpenType and TrueType contributing to the high number of bad typefaces available. Is it having a negative or positive impact of the field of type design?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Talk about a leading question!</p>
<p>Only I don&rsquo;t know what direction it&rsquo;s leading in.</p>
<p>To work backwards, you ask if having a large number of &ldquo;bad typefaces&rdquo; is a good or bad thing. Well, I don&rsquo;t know what a &ldquo;bad typeface&rdquo; is, but surely having more bad typefaces is self-evidently a bad thing.</p>
<p>Moving further backwards, OpenType and TrueType — two quite different things — have nothing in particular to do with a proliferation of bad typefaces; in fact, OpenType has made possible some extraordinary and technically complex typefaces of considerable merit.</p>
<p>Moving even further backwards, everyone has always thought there were too many inferior typefaces. Vignelli didn&rsquo;t invent that. Well, everyone except type designers and typographers who appreciate their work.</p>
<p>And lastly (firstly), do <em>you</em> think there are too many typefaces? Are there too many paintings in the world, or types of food, or performances of Shakespeare, or models of cars? Should we stop painting and cooking and acting and inventing just because we could get by with that we have already? Which is to say, what, after all, is the point of typography? The two questions go hand in hand.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This question, although it gets asked often, deserves to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>But, bad typefaces don&rsquo;t do much harm merely by <em>existing</em>.</p>
<p>So we can focus further on two questions:</p>
<p>Has it become difficult, even for sophisticated, professional typeographers, to filter out quality typefaces because of the proliferation of bad ones?</p>
<p>Are casual type users often going astray because of the proliferation of bad typefaces?</p>
<p>In the first case, I think the answer is no; professional typographers and real type designers are connecting quite well, thank you.</p>
<p>In the second case, casual type users are mostly using what came with their computer. In the case of Windows, that&rsquo;s fairly safe and standard faces, although Arial has come in for some criticism (never mind Comic Sans). I don&rsquo;t think they get fooled by sites like dafont; if they get ambitious, and know something about historical typefaces, they might pull the Bitstream collection from an old Corel product.</p>
<p>Yes, they wouldn&rsquo;t know about contemporary quality free fonts that they might use, say, from the League of Movable Type, for example.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It’s impossible for typographers to keep up with all the faces being published, which is a new situation.</p>
<p>It’s not enough for foundries just to publish an excellent typeface, they have to brand and market it—it won’t become successful on merit alone. Of course, foundries have always advertised their wares.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that there is a proliferation of “good” typefaces (however you deﬁne them) as well as “bad”.</p>
<p>And as Tom Phinney has remarked, the only fonts that are really bad are those with incorrect coding, missing characters, dodgy naming, poor hinting, etc.—technical defects, not the design of the letters.</p>
