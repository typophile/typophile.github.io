  looked a lot like Century Expanded, but the capital J that goes below the line eliminates
  that.\r\n\r\nThe italic capital Q eliminates Baskerville or Bulmer. I'm pretty sure
  this isn't Imprint, because it doesn't look at all like Caslon. (Similarly, it isn't
  the Phemister Old Style.)\r\n\r\nI think I should be able to recognize this typeface
  immediately, but I'm embarassed to admit that I can't.\r\n\r\nAlso, I see that it
  is not Number Twenty-One from Linotype; that doesn't have a descending J, and it
  has a different type of Q in the italic."

  body: "Looking at the Baskerville types in Mac McGrew's book \"American Metal Typefaces
    of the Twentieth Century\", this looks like the Linotype version of Baskerville.
    The italic 'k' is I think the key to separate it from the Monotype and ATF versions.
    It also has that unusually long J, and the italic Q seems to match.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Although I haven't been able to fully verify this, as the page with Baskerville
    on it isn't in the preview of \"The Type Specimen Book\" by V&M Typographical
    on Google Books, and Baskerville isn't in \"The Linotype Manual\", looking at
    <em>Intertype</em> Baskerville on [[http://www.urbancottageindustries.com/blog/print-library/intertype-faces/baskerville-font/|this
    page]] leaves me little doubt that you're absolutely right.\r\n\r\nAh, the Linotype
    specimen in question is online [[http://www.linotypesetting.com/html/content/mats.php|here]]."
