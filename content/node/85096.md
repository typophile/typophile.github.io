  is the company's logo should be in black...its not, when i print put the form the
  logo is all screwed up, some aliasing and the color is somewhere between black/gray/purple
  :-D\r\n\r\nI imported the vector logo in Photoshop, and saved as a PNG file, then
  i upload the font in MS Word and place it in the top header without rescaling it.\r\n\r\nwhat
  exactly am i doing wrong here, the logo is just in black but doesn't output in black
  when printed?"

    to set up the printer device to print black in true black only. \r\n\r\n"

    with the printer. Have you tried printing other black-and-white artwork to see
    if it prints correctly?\r\n\r\nAlso, when in Photoshop you might try changing
    the graphic to grayscale (image > mode > grayscale) before saving it, and see
    if that makes any difference.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Word is an excellent tool for composing and printing office documents in
    an office environment, but was never intended as a professional graphics program\u2014so
    don't expect it to act like one.\r\n\r\nEither or both of the suggestions above
    might solve the problem, with an additional proviso: in Photoshop (or equivalent),
    save to logo as a grayscale <em>TIFF</em> file; this file will be larger than
    your PNG file, but it should be recognized for what it is\u2014i.e., grayscale\u2014as
    opposed to PNG files, which use indexed palettes."
