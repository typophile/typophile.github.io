body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm new to this site and even a bit new to typography
  in general. I do want to learn about it though. I'm an intern-student at a regional
  studio and I've really been having a frustratingly hard time designing with simple
  shapes and typography, while I'm quite good at illustration.\r\n\r\nLately, I've
  been banging my head about a new corporate identity that features quite a lot of
  text. It consists of a name (3 words) and a subtitle (2 words, describing it's services
  and joined by an & character). I'm not going to bother you with any details about
  the identity itself and have you guys indirectly designing it for me, I'd rather
  like to learn how to get there.\r\n\r\nCould anyone share any useful tips or resources
  with me when designing a logo/typographic logo with a long names? Are there elements
  there should be payed specific attention to?\r\n\r\nFinally I would like to know
  if there are any articles out there about choosing typography in general, since
  I often seem to choose wrong or unfitting typography. Actually, anything on the
  web a student should read about typography and logo design would be helpful.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nHessel."

    comes up. Or just google \"typography\".\r\n\r\nAs for logos with lots o' type,
    you can really go two ways:\r\n\r\n1) Use fantastic typography to make those words
    sing. Sometimes you can interconnect letters, words, etc. to achieve an interesting
    logotype. Play with negative space between the words.\r\n\r\n2) Design a fabulous
    Icon or illustrative Mark, and shrink the text down to be a sub-unit of the whole
    Logo... that is, the mark stands out on it's own, but appears with the words for
    \"official\" uses. Sometimes this will work with initials, too. I often take proper
    names and create a symbol from their initials, like \"NL&A\" instead of \"November
    Lazar & Associates.\"\r\n\r\n"

    There is an Essentials section that is a good place to start.

    typographic design, it was difficult for them to think in solid shapes such as
    bodies of type.
