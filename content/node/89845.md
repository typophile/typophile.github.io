  body: "#1 is indeed lining. #4 is not oldstyle though; those are more like lining
    numerals for the small-capss/lowercase (the small-caps are x-height size; call
    them 'petit caps' if you will).\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm aware it's common for the
    oldstyle numerals to fit within the x-height with ascending numerals at cap height
    and descending numerals at lowercase descender height, like I did in #2. They
    were too unstable for such a mechanical grotesque in my opinion so I designed
    these quasi-lining lc numerals (#3), hence 'hybrid'.\r\n\r\nShould I also design
    a set of hybrid numerals for the capitals? Initially I wanted to scrap a few sets
    of numerals but I actually don't mind having such diverse sets."

  body: "I'm still not sure what you refer to as body height but that's fine.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I'm aware the default numeral sets for a typeface to be included are #1
    (lining) and #2 (oldstyle). Oldstyle wasn't working for the small-caps and lowercase
    so I designed #3 (call it small oldstyle if you want) and #4 (lining numerals
    for the small-caps).\r\n\r\nSo, #1 is designed to work with the capitals, #4 to
    work with the small-caps and #3 to use in longer texts. #2 (oldstyle) is there
    just because I consider oldstyle to be a standard numeral set, even though I honestly
    wouldn't use this one myself.\r\n\r\nNow there is room for one more numeral set
    which I think is what you were calling 'hybrid'. These will essentially be like
    #3 but at capital height; a cross between #1 and #2."

    useful if I make another set of numerals like the hybrid in the picture? I think

  body: "There's something \"weird\" about the \"a\" of the regular style.\r\nWhen
    I look it on the thin style, it works well, the reading \"flows\".\r\nBut when
    I read the word of above \"temperature\" there's something that bothers.\r\n\r\nSee
    that when you write \"I'm a scientist\", the \"a\" still works, because the reader
    can't see the loop of the eye, which the regular has.\r\n\r\nWhy don't you try
    a more simple \"a\"? like http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/din-next/pro-regular/glyphs/536654/66\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe, if you want to keep it with that \"oval eye\", find another way. Right
    now I believe it's the letter which looks most informal. It needs to be just a
    little more geometric...\r\nMaybe there's a little too much air above the \"eye\"
    of that \"a\".\r\n\r\nThat's my opinion, hope it helps!\r\nBest,\r\nLian.-"
