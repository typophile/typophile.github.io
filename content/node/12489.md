body: "Hello everyone!\r\n\r\nMy name is Dan, and I am trying to ID some fonts and
  symbols from a movie prop. I have reliabe information that the prop maker used Letraset
  fonts and symbols. I've attached an image of the symbol. It appears to be a \"D\"
  and a \"V\" with the \"D\" rotated 90 degrees clockwise with a colon off to the
  right. \r\n\r\nI thought the letters might be Impact or Haettenschweiler, but they
  are not quite right.\r\nI appreciate any help!\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI- The time period would
  have been between 1978-1980. I also have a couple other symbols I'd like to identify,
  Letraset again, but I don't know what kind of reception my intial inquiry will get.
  If there are any vintage Letraset typophiles out there, I could use your help! \r\n\r\nThanks
  again!\r\n\r\n-Dan\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dan I think a number of us still have Letraset catalogues that date from
    that time... but mine's currently buried in a packing crate! Last time I saw a
    Letraset catalogue for sale it was $2 - invaluable!\r\nTo hazard a guess I think
    these characters might come from the old Helvetica Condensed Black (not the NeueHelvetica)
    or possibly one of the Condensed Grotesques (Monotype? Stephenson Blake?) that
    Letraset had licensed. Looks like there's a slight fattening in the strokes."

      I'll double your $2 to give you a little incentive for digging out the catalogue.

      really appreciate the help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've got an old Letraset catalog. Helvetica Compact seems to be the best match
    for the D and the colon. The V may be from Univers 67.

  body: Oh, I never did anything like that. I was always trying to make Letraset look
    like I'd sent out for type when we had no budget for sending out for type. That's
    how I learned about spacing.

  body: "Thanks again for the help! \r\n\r\nMark, I've found a letraset sheet set
    that contains Helvetica Compact, and pending better pics, it looks like it might
    match!\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to source a Univers sheet yet, but checking
    the font does show some promise!\r\n\r\nAlso, if the area in the picture is roughly
    one inch tall and 1/4th of an inch wide, what point size font would I be looking
    for? Sorry for the newbish questions; I'm a web-guy and get quite lost outside
    of pixels. \r\n\r\nBesides Ebay, are there any other places to pick up one of
    those old Letraset catalogs? If anyone has an extra one, I'd be interested in
    buying it."

  body: "The trouble with old Letraset is that it dries out and is very difficult
    to apply you might be better served by scanning  a rubbed down letter (as greyscale,
    so final size is about 1200 dpi) and manipulating them in Photoshop to get the
    size and position. I expect most Letraset catalogues got thrown out in the 80s
    with the rubylith and snopaque, so finding one could be tricky.\r\nTim"
