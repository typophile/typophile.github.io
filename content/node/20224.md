  body: "Jorge, it's a chain of Mexican restaurants (mostly in Palm Springs,\r\nand
    not bad actually - for a chain) and I think the name is based\r\non their family
    surname, that's why it's spelled funny. Like this:\r\nhttp://www.mcpies.com/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: That is, as David indicated, the predigital typeface Oakwood. Some characters
    vary a bit - most notably the T and A. Nevertheless, the only digital (font) version
    of Oakwood that I'm aware of is <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/index.htm"
    target="_blank">Paul Lloyd's</a> Penshurst (see the dropdown list on the left).
