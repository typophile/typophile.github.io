  sure what to look for.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to clean up my font library, i have
  come across a problem i have never been able to figure out. I have a handful of
  fonts that are all displayed as different typefaces, when they could all potentially
  be under the same list. \r\n\r\nAs an example...\r\n\r\nMy Akzidenz-Grotesk shows
  up in FontBook and my apps in a big list of separate typefaces. So it shows up as
  Akzidenz-Grotesk, Akzidenz-Grotesk Extra, Akzidenz-Grotesk Light, etc....\r\n\r\nIs
  there any way to combine these together so they just show up as a single Akzidenz-Grotesk,
  and then in the menu next to it i can pick bold, light, medium, or whatever. Here
  is a screen shot if that is confusing...\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch!\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n"

    they've fixed the naming for me which in turn fixed the problem. (Or that is how
    I understood it.)\r\n\r\nEither way, I wouldn't recommend doing it yourself. Least/Most
    of all because Berthold's EULA doesn't allow for modifications."
