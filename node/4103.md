body: I Find myself here, 1:57am unable to sleep -- nothing new really -- browsing
  through the latest issue of &#39;print&#39; &#40;magazine&#41;. Now it has been
  some time since I have read print -- and by read I actually mean &#39;reading&#39;
  -- or any other &#39;design&#39; magazine. I have recently started taking home these
  periodicals that have been piling up at the studio for the past few years. Tonight
  been one of the previously mentioned &#39;sleepless nights&#39;, I decide to pull
  out the latest issue and give it the once through. The issue contains a few good
  articles, one notably on clearview &#40;the font&#41;and its designers. But back
  to my original rant, has anyone seen the art direction of this magazine? More clearly
  the type setting? You would think a magazine of design -- printed design -- and
  one expressing &#39;opinions&#39; on type and type design would in the least be
  set half way decent? I would provide scans, but as previously noted, Im in bed <IMG
  SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>.
  Im not even asking for anything great, like using type that does not come bundled
  with Adobe apps, but maybe something as simple as hanging punctuation. Is this too
  much to ask? I can&#39;t remember exactly what print looked like a year or so ago,
  but I don&#39;t rmemeber anyhting this lifeless, and dare I tout &#39;unprofessionally
  set&#39;? <BR> <BR>Curious if I&#39;m the only one with these thoughts. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: 'Kyle, I totally agree - they need to mind the type and typography a lot more,
    and the purdy pitchurz a lot less. But Print is still much better than HOW: Bodoni
    for body and DIN for heads?! Gimme a break. The good news is there&#39;s a redesign
    in the works. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Print has never been at the forefront of editorial design and it&#39;s a shame
    because their content is pretty good &#40;not great&#41; most of the times. In
    this past issue, it seems like they are trying <b>way</b> too hard to be hip.
    Even <a href="http://www.mirkoilic.com/" target="_blank">Mirko Ilic</a>&#39;s
    illustations &#40;school 101 article&#41; came out crappy. They need a redesign
    pronto if they want to keep up with HOW or Step.

    seems around same trend, with their lovely Times/Helvetica combination. Long time
    ago, they used the various ITC Bodoni sizes...? no? hum. <BR> <BR>Sad stories
    for booth readers, Summer Stone and all others type designers if not, everybody.'
