  small vacated town of Saguache, Colorado, and stumbled across one of four Linotype
  Newspaper printers in the USofA, and the only legit business operating out of the
  small 'downtown' stretch of this small valley town.  I was able to have a few words
  with the sole proprietor, Mr. Dean Coombs, who is keeping the family business alive
  and true to form.  We chatted about the equipment, type addiction, the great depression,
  trees and the circus.  It was a very pleasant and unexpected stop on a trip through
  the valley.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, he gifted me a stapled print-out which pretty much represented
  his type library of Linotype typefaces. I noticed a couple that I haven't seen or
  heard of, and some once popular but now lost ones as well.  I can write out a list
  of what he has on hand if anybody's interested.  The ones I'm particularly interested
  are Vogue and all the varieties of Metro.\r\n\r\nI've seen that there was some discussion
  on Vogue and a little bit of history, but really, when is there going to be a digital
  release of this?  I cannot be the only one who would love to have it.  As a Chicagoan,
  I identify this face with many of the 60's and 70's soul and funk 45s coming out
  of the city, and it's something I would love to be able to use (it's all in the
  lowercase a).  Is there anything close?\r\n\r\nAs for Metro--Metromedium, Metrolight,
  Metroblack, I see that there is a <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/metrolite_no_2/\">digital
  version</a> available, but it doesn't look the same as in the sample I have here.
  \ I'd like to know more about this typeface in general, and where it stands with
  Vogue, Futura and all the geometric sans faces being produced.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, if
  you're ever in the area, I would highly recommend paying this place in Saguache
  a visit.  Very friendly and informative gentleman with quite an interesting shop.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDavid"

    would not be able to name it Metro.\r\nIf the design (1930) were literature or
    music, it would be public domain by now, so even though there is no legal copyright
    on type designs, there would be nothing unethical (in the informal understanding
    of those in the type business who care about such things) in copying Dwiggins'
    design.\r\nYou beg the question of what a \"true\" revival would be, as there
    is so much room for interpretation between letterpress and offset (and screen)
    typography. Would \"honesty\" include a trace of the letterpress process?"

  body: No, I don't think so. Because to be that honest it would have to follow Dwiggins's
    love of the crisp. Perhaps it would have ever so tiny roundings on the corners,
    but that would be it. I'd want to see the sparkle just as he would.

  body: "David --\r\n\r\nI suspect (without seeing samples) that if the Metro you're
    looking at differs markedly from the digital versions, then it is probably because
    Mr. Coombs has matrices of the original Metro fonts, as opposed to Metro No. 2
    fonts.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial release of the Metro family (which took place
    over several years, starting in 1929 with Metroblack), a decision was made to
    change several characters and re-release the fonts with the suffix \"No. 2\".
    These became more popular and are the forms that have made it into the digital
    versions, and the originals are now rarely seen.\r\n\r\nIf I'm correct, then you'll
    notice dramatic differences in a few key characters: a and g will be most obvious
    -- they will be 2-story forms.\r\n\r\nOther characters that changed between the
    original and the No. 2 are:\r\n\r\nA M N V W v w -- all vertices were given sharp
    points; G -- spur was raised and given a cross-bar; J -- was raised to rest on
    baseline and given more curve; and comma & quotes were given a more simplified,
    flatter form.\r\n\r\nAll of these adjustments give Metro No. 2 a more geometric
    flavor than the original design. I think these changes may have preceded the release
    of Futura. But they may have been a response to Futura. I'd have to confirm dates,
    which I don't have at hand right now.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    18, 24 pt. size, Metrolite No. 2, from the 1958 Linotype catalog.\r\n(18 and 24
    pt. are Two-letter display; the One letter-display for 24 pt. has the different
    \"a\" also).\r\n\r\nThree authorship issues to consider in a revival:\r\n1. Variance
    of size specific masters \r\n2. Effect of press gain at different sizes (traces
    of the letterpress process)\r\n3. Alternates: this catalog shows the original
    non-sharp-pointed capitals Kent mentions available as alternates, along with two-storey
    \"a\", two-storey \"g\", and Kabelized \"e\" (diagonal crossbar) and W (overlapping
    Vs). In fact, a choice of three forms for cap W! \r\n\r\nSo, a redesigner could
    make a character true to:\r\nThe designer's authorship: original drawing.\r\nThe
    printer's authorship: a revival from a choice of different quality printed samples:
    eg on different paper stocks, and also a choice of different size-specific masters.\r\nThe
    foundry's authorship: the original foundry's specification of which alternate
    form is the default.\r\n\r\nA redesign resolves the many often conflicting shapes
    and processes involved in the various originals. For instance, Linotype's Metro
    Office adopts the alternate forms of (3) above as default."

  body: "Thanks for the info + history.  I hope that someday I could provide something
    to the depths that many of you continue to do.\r\n\r\nFrom this printout the Metro
    samples do contain 2-storey lowercase a's but are still labeled as No. 2, so I'm
    assuming this has to do with the alternate characters provided?  I notice that
    Mr. Coombs has both Metrolite and Metrolight printed on this sheet.  I wonder
    if this is merely a typo or not.\r\n\r\nIn any regard, a really nice typeface.
    \ I like the soft-tailed lowercase t's as opposed to the coldness of Futura's
    (which both certainly have their place).  The nice little bits of humanistic traits
    seem to be executed in good taste.  My only question would be which digital version
    do people prefer?  Do any of them come with the alternate characters?"
