body: "I am trying to identify the attached font image. The font appears to be a san
  serif font, but has some almost\r\nserif-like characteristics, like the curve to
  the right of the \"u\". Note that the bottom of the \"g\" is curled, but open; and
  the top of the lowercase characters are chiseled/angled (most obvious e.g. the \"i\").\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help in advance,\r\nPrefix"
