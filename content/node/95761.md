body: "So this is the final round of revisions to this logo - and i'm attempting to
  center / and make equal distance the letters in this mark. the crest / rum bar are
  perfectly centered - but i'm running into issues with the width of the words the
  O in house and I in saint are giving me troubles - i'm wondering should i tighten?
  or scale it out - or does the overall width of saint and house have to be the same?
  (which is what i'm trying to do).\r\n\r\nAfter futzing with it for a while i came
  pretty close... i'm still not happy with the O and I - I added small slab serifs
  to help balance it (i think it helps some). \r\n\r\nany thoughts greatly appreciated."

  body: "To my eye,the word 'SAINT' is much too spread out relative to the word HOUSE.
    In fact, I just measured and on my screen it's about 10% larger!   Similarly,
    RUM is has too much space relative to BAR. And they are far from  \"perfectly
    centered\".  RUM starts about 44mm to the left of the center of the crest, while
    BAR ends 39mm to its right. The only thing that's \"centered\" is the right edge
    of the M and the left edge of the B.  Stop looking at individual letters and look
    at the visual effect of the logo as a whole.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    the words saint and house should be equal width (which is difficult with out altering
    this font)\r\n"

  body: "Depending on what you're using, you should be able to move each element (letter)
    completely separately. You are not creating text with a font - you're creating
    a graphic design with design elements, some of which just happen to look like
    letters of the english alphabet. Do NOT use whatever kerning or letterspacing
    is inherent in the font- it is completely irrelevant to your task at hand.\r\n\r\nYou'd
    probably be better off opening your logo in a program like Adobe Illustrator or
    Corel Draw, converting the text to curves, grouping each element, and then sliding
    each design element or groups of elements around until they fit and look right.\r\n\r\n

  body: Yes, Nick, there ARE many ways to skin a cat.  But esigns that are significantly
    unbalanced are more psychologically acceptable than those that are only a LITTLE
    off; it's clear that that's the way they're meant to be. When something is just
    a little off, it looks like a mistake.  That's why both versions of The Times'
    nameplate look fine, while "Saint House" just looks slightly askew.

  body: "Then I suppose the question still stands - does it make sense to try and
    make saint and house equidistant with the crest in the center - and align rum
    bar centered to that.. that was I was going to attempt to do, but was struggling
    visually to make that happen. Yes it's all curves and i'm using illustrator CS5\r\n"

  body: "My inclination would be to sort the HOUSE kerning (the HO combination is
    a little too tight); then work on SAINT to a similar visual amount of kerning;
    then work on the spaces either side of the device (the T\u2022 is a bit loose
    thanks to the open space under the bar).\r\n\r\nThen, when it is in use, centre
    on the device not on the overall width (you might want to drop in an invisible
    exclusion area box to make life easier).\r\n\r\nTim"

      it. I am unclear as to what "an invisible exclusion area box" is. I so appreciate
      the assistance. '

  body: It would be useful to consider the logo <em>in situ</em>, which is one inference
    to be drawn from the <em>Times</em> comparison.

  body: "In the illustrator file create a box with no fill and no stroke, centred
    on the logo device, make it larger than the logo. The area surrounding the logo
    into which no other graphic element or text should intrude \u2013 the exclusion
    area, this surround could be based on half the height of one of the characters
    or maybe the height of the device.\r\n\r\nWhen you import it into InDesign, for
    example, and size it and centre it in a picture box, it will position the device
    on the centre line because it uses the invisible box to centre.\r\n\r\nTim"
