  body: "Usually I stick to Safari on Mac, IE (latest whatever version) on Win. I
    can't recall when it worked with either of these. But yet since I see images pop
    up in others' posts so yesterday, I gave it a desperate last go using Firefox,
    and that worked.\r\n\r\nOh wait, here at work it works with IE 8 as well:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HeadAgainstWall_3651.gif]"

    impression is that it's not the browser, but rather the file size: images smaller
    than 130k seem to work. \r\nI'm disappointed that has remained a bug for so long."

    uploaded many images here using Safari on my Mac, so I don't think it's a browser
    issue."

    this bug is coming from. All the things we can see/control point to much higher
    filesize limits. We'll keep pounding on it...\r\n\r\n"

    to show my image so I decided to give FF a try. That worked, so I revisited this
