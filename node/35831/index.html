<p>Elitist is the word that I will use. This is not to bring down Bringhurst as a person, but I remember a woman who was staring lovingly at one of his books and said sadly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the kind of book for me.&rdquo; We both knew what she meant. I was sad too, because it wasn&rsquo;t the kind of book for me either.</p>
<p>His books are all printed in limited editions, using custom designed typefaces digital AND metal, using only the finest papers and inks.</p>
<p>They are works of art, and are not really meant to be read.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, that defeats the whole damn purpose.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a couple of Bringhurst&rsquo;s books of poetry. He does not only publish with fine presses. I recently attended a lecture of his and it was sheer poetry. The man has a gift.</p>
<p>Fine press editions are often more seen as the work of the printer-publisher. But it is a wrong assumption that such books are not to be read. It&rsquo;s just that they cost a lot to own. There isn&rsquo;t much one can do to keep down the costs of such books, it really has nothing to do with snobbery or elitism. Simply the cost of producing a well crafted book with high quality materials.</p>
<p>A book I did a some years back cost $23,000 just for materials. Divide that by the possible number of books that can be produced (100 to 200). And add two years worth of labor. I could have bought a car with that money.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re making a bad assumption here: that the quality of the $10 print is the same as the quality of the $100 print.</p>
<p>Great books cost money to make, end of story. ANYONE can make a cheap book. People who make great books should be supported not reviled! (Neither should those who make cheap books. Have you any idea how much effort it is to make ANY book? ?)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not saying that great books shouldn&rsquo;t exist. But books like Bringhurst&rsquo;s are for a limited number of people with too much money to play with and are not intended for common folk such as myself. They are to be admired only from a distance, thus making it valueless in my eyes.</p>
<p>The assumption that I am making is that the whole point of publishing is for the <em>content</em> rather than the package.</p>
<p>Now, I could be wrong. (Probably, most likely) Maybe Bringhurst&rsquo;s poetry sucks. Maybe he&rsquo;s in it for the book alone, as well as the people who are buying his work.</p>
<p>There must be a middle ground somewhere. A book doesn&rsquo;t need to be printed in endangered panda bear blood on baby seal skin parchment and bound in siberian tiger leather to be of good quality. (Hyperbole people, hyperbole.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this discussion with a number of people, including one who does incredible work and charges virtually nothing for it. All she&rsquo;s doing is saying &ldquo;my time isn&rsquo;t worth anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen Bringhurst&rsquo;s work in more &ldquo;mass market&rdquo; books, so it&rsquo;s out there.</p>

<p>I like to think of these books as being the equivalent of a Formula One race car - for sure these books and these cars are works of art, the pinnacle of engineering, but also they&rsquo;re designed to be used.

<p>What!? You seem to be saying that poetry is something quite mechanical &hellip; &ldquo;the same poetry &hellip; somewhere else&rdquo;??? Does the work of one poet become the equivalent to that of anothers? Or is each not unique, passing a message from the heart of the poet to the heart of the reader in a completely unique and individual way.</p>
<p>I am not a poet, but I write, and I would hate to think that writing is a commodity that can be bought and sold by the lowest bidder.</p>

<p>Now, it is the case that Bringhurst does indeed print his poetry in more affordable editions, so I will retract some of my earlier criticism. But I know for a fact that he has things out there that just are not for mass consuption.</p>

<p>James: trying to find Bringhurst&rsquo;s poetry books is problematic at best, and you are correct that going through Amazon UK is a better bet if one is in the U.S.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The problem likely begins with the fact that the bulk of Bringhurst&rsquo;s poetry has been published by small Canadian presses, and, as noted above, many of those books are out of print (I&rsquo;m talking strictly about his poetry here). There is some cross-over, of course: for example, his <em><a href="http://www.gaspereau.com/1894031660.shtml" target="_blank">Ursa Major</a></em> is a book of poetry (of sorts) that he also designed with Andrew Steeves at Gaspereau Press (and for which he received an Alcuin award [Canada&rsquo;s national book design awards]), and it&rsquo;s still available at a regular trade price. A few of his other books of poetry are still available on back-lists from various Canadian publishers, but, as above, the bulk of it is out of print. The argument above about his books being out of reach (due to price) really doesn&rsquo;t apply to the bulk of his poetry, much of which was published <em>long</em> before he wrote <em>ETS</em>; the problem is simply that they&rsquo;re out of print and hard to track down.</p>
<p>As for the expensive things, his most recent projects such as the Koch edition of <em><a href="http://www.peterkochprinters.com/show.php?bookid=3" target="_blank">Parmenedes</a></em> or the elaborate <em><a href="http://www.centerforbookarts.org/bookstore/newworldsuite.asp" target="_blank">New World Suite</a></em> are really exceptions, and are designed and produced as fine-press projects that are not really meant for a strictly reader-audience. Then there <em>are</em> a few poetry collections that are also out reach due to cost and limited release (such as Barbarian Press' edition of <em>The Blue Roofs of Japan</em>, or Ninja Press' edition of <em>The Book of Silences</em>), but there are also plenty of basic trade editions of his work, many of which are listed in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bringhurst" target="_blank">Wikipedia listing</a>.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The market for poetry is minute; most writers are lucky to sell a few hundred copies &ndash; very lucky. In fact, it&rsquo;s a bit like fonts.</p>
<p>Because words are particularly important in poetry, and you are meant to dwell on them, the type requires more attention than in other material, as everyone who publishes poetry knows. An astonishing amount of poetry is still published, expensively, today, on letterpress using metal Bembo, simply because there aren&rsquo;t any digital alternatives that look as good in poetry.</p>
<p>Not to say that there haven&rsquo;t been great poetry books published in other ways, for example offset from a typewriter &ndash; . But that wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate for Bringhurst &ndash; who probably, given his interest in digital type, wouldn&rsquo;t go the metal route &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know what his current thinking is on that particular issue, it would be interesting to find out.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m amazed that anything Bringhurst does is finally open to criticism. I and some others were pilloried for doing that a few years ago!</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s so bad about spending $100 for a book? If you think that&rsquo;s a lot, maybe your priorities are wrong, because no matter how poor you are, $100 is not that very much money. It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re being asked to choose between a book and a car. That said, I don&rsquo;t myself spend a lot on books, though I would if I could!</p>
<p>The curious thing about the tight, impoverished poetry world is this: a few years ago, Poetry Magazine was given $90 million in someone&rsquo;s will, a meteoric, absolutely unprecedented event in the entire history of poetry. I would have thought the result would, could, have been, a lot of great and beautiful subsidized poetry publishing: exquisite books that could sell for a very few dollars. Has any of this happened? What <em>is</em> the magazine doing with all its lucre?</p>
