body: What are the trends in leading sizes for body copy at 8pt. I understand these
  would change depending on typeface. I am using News 701. I really just wondered
  what contemporary trends were in this area.

  body: There are *trends* for leading?? I thought there was a fairly standard measure,
    or if nothing else, it would depend on the particular font.

  body: "Let me clarify slightly.\r\n\r\nI suppose this may well be a design issue,
    and I should have posted they're, but I will continue regardless. I am a graphic
    designer who often wonders what (when using only 1/2 paragraph coloums in a design)
    leading is popular for the point size. I understand that legibility is a factor,
    but style also plays an important role in designs i feel.\r\n\r\nJust a little
    side note... how was the default leading size - point size ratio determined on
    standard software packages such as quark and indesign? Is there any sort of formula
    \r\nat all? "

  body: "Quark's default setting for leading is 20%, so 10pt would have 12pt leading,
    but this can be altered. 10 on 12 is not a bad generic starting place, but as
    you noted it really depends on the typeface, measure and eventual use. If a trend
    exists I would guess it's for looser (greater) leading.\r\nTim"

    role in designs i feel.</em>\r\n\r\nOK... I understand what you are asking for,
    which is any insight into what current \"stylistic trends\" are happening regarding
    line spacing (leading).\r\n\r\nOver ten years ago, graphic designers were adding
    HUGE amounts of leading on copy blocks in ads and collateral print. Why? Not because
    of readability or text color, but because it was \"da bomb.\"\r\n\r\nAs far as
    I see (just looking through ads in <em>Graphic Design USA</em>) that affectation
    is still being inflicted today... body copy with line spacing at 30% -- 50%+.
    That translates into 12 pt. type at 16 -- 20+pts of lead.\r\n\r\nOver seven years
    ago (to my recollection) there was a resurgence of minus leading in short or narrow
    copy blocks for a sort of \"anarchist\" appeal. Again, not for readability but
    as a statement of arrogance with an <em>I don't give a f#ck if you can read my
    message</em> attitude of old puck rockers or even older dadaists.\r\n\r\nMost
    of the people on this forum are more concerned about aspects of readability and
    even text color. I am also a graphic designer by nature and understand your temptation
    to follow the \"in\" thing.\r\n\r\nMy personal suggestions is to become more aware
    of what type is all about, and develop an \"eye\" for spotting how headlines and
    copy blocks are constructed. If you look at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060748079/qid=1135177689/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-6002874-1652067?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\"
    target=\"new\">TDC Award Annuals</a> you can see what was considered the best
    of the best uses of type and typography for that given year.\r\n\r\nFor the graphic
    designers' point of view, you can open any of the design award annuals of various
    organizations or countries, and view what was considered exceptional or hot. Remember,
    style is not a universal trend, but often segmented into genre, market segments,
    cultural, regional and country preferences as well.\r\n\r\nYou need to focus on
    what your piece is trying to say, and to whom you are directing the message in
    order to start making decisions on your approach to the design."
