  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So there is this video circulating from the Build conference where Typekit&rsquo;s Mr. Brown gives an absolutely heroic rational for not just picking font sizes with a dartboard app and its well worth watching and listening closely to, although I&rsquo;m in a loud car on Amtrak now with Leon Russel&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a spell on you&rdquo; blasting me along to a date with the brick maps of NYC.</p>
<p>Back in Tim&rsquo;s presentation, he shows one of Aldus' pages and points out how the type and illustrations match in intensity, by design. Well, I know they do, and the page Tim shows, shows this more than many of the pages of the same book. Is this truely a design choice, or is this a production issue?</p>
<p>e.g.  I know, for sure, from my own era of letterpress and lithography, that big contrast between the largest and smallest areas of black is a serious inking issue that brings either a failure of blackness of large areas, an over-inking of the type, or addition cost from separate runs for each part.</p>
<p>This is after all why we love Figgins, n sleep with his book under the pillow. Anybody got any idears in this area? Is there a thread on this here?</p>

I recently read a quote from De Vinne talking about this subject of text and image ideally matching in colour, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to push the idea through my brain into a real world understanding. Your explaination definitely helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">But text and image of matching color is just one of the many of ways of designing things aesthetically pleasing. It happens to be a safe one, for those stuck in bad eras of production, or where limited imagination rules. Isnt it contrast, as opposed to a lack thereof that draws eyeballs in design today, and most of this century?</div>

<p>Yes. And contrast isn’t the only change; the density of information within publication is increasing and notions about so-called classical designs with huge margins and the modernist hangup on tracts of whitespace are dying off. Ellen Lupton brings this up in the second edition of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thinking With Type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; which, along with her book <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Graphic Design: The New Basics<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, provides a nice example of how a great deal of information can be packed into a relatively small book and still be a nice read.</p>
<p>This seems connected to the constant change in the function of the book. Those huge margins are no longer needed in world where people rarely use them to take notes; a publication with carefully considered even color on every page is not relevant in a world where few people will sit down to savor such an experience.</p>

<p>And, too, uneven color doesn&rsquo;t cause printing problems for offset lithography, the way it did for traditional letterpress.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think the reason Cheltenham is so generally excoriated these days doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with its overall characteristics, but rather that the shape of certain elements in the letters - the rounded bowls in them come to mind - gives the face a quaint and out-of-date appearance.</p>
<p>Also, it combines elements of an oldstyle type with other design elements that were up-to-date when the face was designed; this kind of mixture is usually associated with faces that date badly, while faces that truly represent their era consistently live on (Garamond, Bodoni, Clarendon, Franklin Gothic, Futura). Although I think that Times Roman will be an exception to this generalization, as the problem depends on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is combined, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Cheltenham also has a problem in that it’s really the only design to successfully use some of the features that it originates. Nobody else dares lift that stuff because it would be so obvious, but because nobody does Cheltenham will always stand out in the eyes of designers.</div>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I approach type history, but I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m up for tackling the entire history of type in that manner :-)</p>
<p>In a piece I wrote about hand lettering in the 20th century, I certainly related its rise to the practical and economic shortcomings of display type, and its demise to the development of photo-typositors: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Golden Age of Hand Lettering in American Advertising<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
