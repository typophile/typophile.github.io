  <BR> <BR>Is this another ripoff of someone else&#39;s intellectual property? Details
  as to what&#39;s included are sketchy.

  body: Interesting. I think your right when you said &#34;someone else&#39;s intellectual
    property&#34;, but who knows. I wouldn&#39;t pay $29.99 for these fonts, let alone
    a license to use them.  <BR> <BR>;&#41; <BR> <BR>If you go to the <a href="http://www.macxware.com/faqs_fonts.asp"
    target="_blank">FAQ</a> page, and scroll to the bottom, you can follow the link
    listed in the last answer. This PDF has a listing.  <BR> <BR>

  body: I have to agree with Tiffany after seeing the PDF, calling these fonts is
    a stretch

  body: I&#39;m not sure, but I seem to recall seeing this package at one of the Apple
    stores. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, quite a few of these are free <a href="http://larabiefonts.com/fonts/a.html"
    target="_blank">Ray Larabie</a> fonts. No wonder they can sell them so cheap.
    I wonder if Ray knows about this...

  body: 'Hello: <BR>I am writing from the site that you say is selling 1000 fonts
    for $30.  Yes it&#39;s true that we do sell fonts, but all the font developers
    have given us permission to include them on to the CD.  I have written emails
    from all of them filed away. <BR> <BR>I just spoke with Tom Murphy from Tom&#39;s
    Fonts&#40;Since he was listed on this page&#41; and he is now clear on the issue
    since he did give me permission, just like all the other font developers did.
    <BR> <BR>There is no way I would include any fonts from any developers without
    getting permission.   <BR> <BR>If anyone needs to see the &#34;permission&#34;,
    I will gladly provide it. <BR> <BR>thanks <BR>macXware <BR>'
