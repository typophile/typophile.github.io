body: Hi All- <BR> <BR>I am venturing into new territory and was hoping someone might
  have some pointers. I am working on a Russian typeface and along with my dim understanding
  of encodings, I am also at a loss to find relevant information regarding kern pairs.
  Any relevant caches of information out there that folks can point me to? Ideally,
  I&#39;d like to find a list of common kern pairs.  <BR> <BR>Thanks a bunch! <BR>

  body: 'I don&#39;t have a list of common pairs, but I do have an extensive list
    of Russian words that I use to test spacing and kerning of Cyrillic fonts. These
    are derived from online Russian dictionaries and word lists. The idea is to show
    at least one example of every combination of two letters that occur in the language.
    Here they are: <BR> <BR><!--attachment: Cyrillic_Kerning_source_files-37328.zip*mime_zip.gif*application/x-zip-compressed*17.7*Russian+kerning*Cyrillic+Kerning+source+files%2ezip

    <BR> <BR>Note that all these words are Russian, so I can&#39;t guarantee that
    a font kerned using these will work ideally for other Cyrillic-script languages.
    There may be, for example, combinations of letters that occur in Ukrainian that
    do not occur in Russian. <BR> <BR>If you are interested, I also have versions
    of these lists designed for use in the FontLab metrics/kerning window, i.e. using
    the /GLYPHNAME convention instead of the Cyrillic characters. However, the glyph
    names I use are Tiro&#39;s internal production names, not the AFII or uniXXXX
    names recommended by Adobe for the shipping font. We have a rather elaborate glyph
    name management system that allows us to switch back and forth between production
    names and final font names. If you&#39;re interested, I can fit you out with these
    files too.'
