  body: "Looks like an advertisement showing well executed lettering in a fashionable
    style from about 1900-1910.\r\nNote variations such as the thickness of the leg
    on R. Also note the adjustments to fit the Cartouche: the top lhs serif on M is
    angled so as to not disturb the leaves; and the top of the final S is squeezed
    so it does not overlap the edge.\r\nSomeone may have made a font based on the
    lettering, but I have not seen it. Nick Curtis made a lot of fonts made on less
    information.\r\nThe serifs are in a style sometimes called Mansard or Detroit.
    \r\nThe terminals on the S are in a style sometimes called beaked. This is found
    in some fonts based on designs of the era such as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/verona/\">Verona</a>,
    which also has E in a style similar to your image. \r\nDon"
