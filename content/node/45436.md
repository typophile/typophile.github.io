  what is it that excites you about old and new typefaces? \r\n\r\nwhat is it that
  you look at that gets you excited and anxious to use it? also what is everyone's
  favorite 10 favorite typefaces that they regularly use and why?\r\n\r\nit could
  be the form, the serifs, or san serifs, the way it sits on a page,  it could be
  anything, YOU TELL ME!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    love type don't really know why.\r\nJust yesterday I found my self wanting to
    buy a 6.000\u20AC type cd.\r\n(Wished i had that amount of money to spend on type)\r\nI
    must say that the form and flow of the typography are the first things I look
    at... but I love to look at every single detail.\r\n\r\nI know I'm not helping
    much... I'll sleep on this and post back if manage to get a more concrete answer."

    very much a feeling, therefore i'd be lowering its strength and amplitude by explaining
    it with words.\r\n\r\ndr"

    up with ideas for more). \r\n\r\nI am amazed that there are so many ways to express
    that same glyph\u2014thousands of ways to show f, or i or &. I love the interplay
    of the light and dark. I love the fact that someone took the time to create a
    a set of these varying shapes that have the same theme, so they work together.
    \ I love the craftsmanship and care that go into a beautiful typeface. And the,
    that person (or team) goes on the create other weights and versions of that same
    theme. \r\n\r\nI love to look at the details of a typeface. The way  the designer
    decided to have terminals flare a certain way, how the serifs are shaped, if it
    has long or short ascenders and descenders.\r\n\r\nI love Jim Parkinson's translation
    of hand painted lettering to a typeface. I love H&FJ's studious interpretations
    of historic faces. I love Hermann Zapf's way of putting a little calligraphy into
    each typeface.\r\n\r\nI love Ron Arnholm for making me love type more than I already
    did.\r\n\r\nI love everyone I've ever had a conversation with about kerning, typefaces,
    the shape of a letter.\r\n\r\nI love it all, because there is art, craftsmanship,
    care, love and commitment involved in all of it.\r\n\r\nI love type, because it
    made me appreciate my dad that much more. He is not a typographer, designer or
    art director. He is a pilot, and loves everything to do with flight. When I was
    about 9, my parents had a cookout, and most of the friends who came were also
    pilots. A small plane flew over, and the pilots stopped talking, looked up, observing
    the plane. \"It's a Mooney,\" one said. \"His prop is out of pitch,\" said my
    dad. \"He doesn't have the right prop for that plane,\" said another. This set
    off an hour long discussion on props. For years after that, I thought \"Who could
    really care that much about propellers?\" When I was bout 35, I was having a lovely
    discussion with another AD about serifs, and it dawned on me\u2014serifs are my
    propellers. And it gave me that much more appreciation for my dad, and his love
    of flight. And now I even kind of care a bit about props. The funny thing is,
    for the last 9 years, his love has been sailplanes (gliders)\u2014no props!\r\n"

    and following it to wherever unexpected it leads me!"
