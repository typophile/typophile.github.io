body: "I am surprised by the popularity of this font. And, to be honest, to see it
  in Best Seller and Hot New Fonts in MyFonts. I made it for a Finnish cider brand,
  and only finished it last month after noticing that the license had only been valid
  until 2006.\r\n\r\nThis font was really made for different variants of the brand,
  and pretty soon the design was changed, and this script was obsolete.\r\n\r\nBut
  in MyFonts it seems to be doing really well. Go figure."
