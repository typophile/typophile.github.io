body: I&#39;ve been feeling really inspired by design and typography recently, and
  at the same time have been thinking it may be time for a change of careers. I&#39;m
  currently a software engineer with interests in lots of other geeky quasi-artistic
  pursuits, most notably photography and typography. Software development pays the
  bills, but it&#39;s not inspiring me so much recently. I&#39;m considering going
  back to school and getting either an associate&#39;s degree or a BFA in typography
  and / or graphic design, and have been investigating the various options in San
  Francisco. <BR> <BR>I have quite a few friends who are graduates of CCA[C] who have
  nice things to say about its programs in general, but they seem unanimous that its
  typography classes are pretty rough sledding. Also, CCA is pretty expensive. I know
  less about any of the other schools in SF, except that my options are limited in
  terms of degree programs. The things that interest me most are type design and book
  / long-form document design, and I&#39;m less interested in advertising and other
  kinds of flashy design. It would be cool to study calligraphy and letterpress printing.
  At the same time, I <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/63805.html?1107462750">fear
  no Helvetica</a>. <BR> <BR>Do any of you have any wisdom to contribute? As was <a
  href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/64669.html?1107590866">noted elsewhere</a>,
  the Bay Area is a place unusually rich with skilled typographers and developers;
  presumably some of you teach locally, or at least have opinions about the programs
  available. <BR> <BR>As a coda, someday I&#39;d like to pursue an MFA in photography,
  probably somewhere outside of the US &#40;most of the photographers I admire most
  are from northern Germany, which makes that my likeliest destination&#41;, so that&#39;s
  part of what makes a BFA more interesting to me.
