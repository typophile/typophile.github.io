  Really great!  I was hoping some of you have ideas as to what the trends might be/what
  you would like them to be in 2018.  I am researching type history, and the cycles
  of trends, but I was hoping to get some more perspectives.  Thank you so much for
  your input, and all the other information I have gleaned from this site!

    with ball terminals will be all the rage.\r\nTraditional text fonts like Times
    will only be used for their ironic value."

  body: All the old foundries will have collapsed after the print market dried up
    and users refused to license fonts that only allow web embedding with EOT. 99%
    of font use will be online, and nobody will use fonts designed before 2009. Eventually
    a holding company will consolidate all of the old fonts under the latest incarnation
    of Linotype, and in October 2018 Michael Beirut will blog about seeing Univers
    for the first time in a decade as he took the boat in to work in the morning.
    Fonts designed by the proponents of DRM will remain out of use for centuries,
    their designers blackballed along with the RIAA and MPAA.
