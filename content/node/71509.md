body: "Below are excerpts from font licenses from the Adobe shop and Fontshop.  If
  I embed a font in a PDF document created with MS Word or InDesign, is it allowed
  for me to put this PDF online?  Most people wouldn't be able to edit such a document,
  but it is possible. Any guidance is appreciated\r\n\r\n-- F\r\n\r\n\"Preview & Print:
  A font with an embedding permission of Preview & Print allows the font, either fully
  or as a subset, to be embedded in an electronic document solely for the purpose
  of viewing that document on screen and/or printing that document. While a font with
  a Preview & Print embedding permission (either through data in the font file or
  the font\u2019s license agreement) may be embedded in an electronic document, the
  embedded font may not be used to further edit the document it is contained in or
  to edit or create other documents. Most fonts in the Adobe Type Showroom are set
  for Preview & Print embedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Embedding. You may embed the Font Software
  in documents, applications or devices either as a rasterized representation of the
  Font Software (e. g., a GIF or JPEG) or as a subset of the Font Software as long
  as the document, application or device is distributed in a secure format that permits
  only the viewing and printing but not the editing of the text. You need an additional
  licence from FSI or its Distributors (i) for the use of the Font Software in documents,
  applications or devices permitting editing of the text, if such documents, applications
  or devices shall be distributed to third parties or (ii) if the Font Software is
  embedded neither as a subset nor as a rasterized representation.\""

    don\u2019t have to worry about the possibility that someone will crack open your
    PDF and edit it when you clearly create it to not be editable. As long as you
    get things right the first time around you\u2019re ok. "

    FontFeed article</a> gives some more concrete answers.

    number of font-makers treat as standard are generally recognized as being sufficient,
    certainly by Adobe and FontShop; they vary from 'anything goes' to 'no embedding'.
    Word honours them, and Acrobat at least warns you about disregarding them."
