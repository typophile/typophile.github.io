  Pro</strong> - inspired by tomb inscriptions\r\n\r\nFountain and PSY/OPS come together
  in a special joint release of a\r\nnew typeface from Portuguese type designer Rui
  Abreu.\r\n\r\nCatacumba Pro is a six-weight typeface inspired by the painted\r\ninscriptions
  of the <em>Igreja de S\xE3o Francisco</em> church's catacombs in\r\nPorto, Portugal.
  The forms are clearly influenced by Victorian\r\nstyle, with an unmistakable French
  heritage, and yet they somehow\r\nconvey a decidedly Portuguese sensibility.\r\n\r\nCatacumba's
  centerpieces are its two titling styles: the exuberant\r\n<strong>Excelsa</strong>,
  and the Didonesque <strong>Moderata</strong>.\r\nFrom these two decoratives, four
  new cuts are derived. These,\r\nthe <strong>Text</strong> fonts, are tamer and more
  understated, but maintain \r\nthe same artisanal grounding and DNA as the display
  fonts. \r\nEach Catacumba font includes a wide selection of OpenType ranges\r\nand
  features, allowing for extensive use within the Latin range.\r\n\r\nDesigned by
  Rui Abreu and mastered by PSY/OPS\r\n\r\n<strong>Catacumba Pro can be found at:</strong>\r\nhttp://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/catacumba\r\nhttp://psyops.com/catacumba\r\n\r\n<strong>Video
