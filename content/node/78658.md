body: "I'm looking for some advice on how to do a job as efficiently and painlessly
  as possible. \r\nI have to scan multiple pages from a text book, all of which have
  pencil marks and notations on them.\r\nI need to separate the pencil marks from
  the rest of the matter on the scan i.e. the type, page edges etc.\r\nThe book type
  is printed in black, and the pencil, naturally, is the usual graphite colour, and
  in a few \r\ninstances the pencil overlaps the type. Can it be isolated using channels?
  I'm keen to avoid manually using the\r\nlasso and eraser tools if possible...\r\n\r\nAny
  advice appreciated."

  body: "Maybe a silly question, but can't you just erase the pencil marks?\r\n\r\nScan
    the pages in grayscale, not colour or black and white. Then go to Levels under
    the Adjustments menu. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/levels_5062.jpg]\r\n\r\nA
    combination of sliding the left-side control right a bit & the right-side one
    left should remove any mid-tones. You'll probably still need to clean up a bit.
    Rather than use the eraser on the actual scan I would create a new layer on top
    and paint over any remaining marks with white.\r\n\r\nThere's lots of tutorials
    for scanning line art online. I got the above technique from comic book ones that
    were for cleaning up a scan of an inked pencil sketch."

  body: "Hi Justin, thanks for the comments. In fact I need to retain the pencil marks,
    and delete everything else! Odd, I know.\r\nOtherwise your tip would be indeed
    the way forward."

  body: In which case the middle control will probably need to be experimented with.
    If you can get the printed text as black as possible and the pencil a mid-tone
    grey you should be able to select all the black with the wand tool and delete
    it.
