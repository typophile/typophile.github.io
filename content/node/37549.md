body: "Hi all -- I'm working with Whitman-RomanLF and I'd like Whitman-ItalicLF and
  Whitman-BoldLF to be linked in Windows applications.  I have long blocks of text
  and can't take the time to apply a new font to each italic section.  The way it
  is now, my application (WordPerfect X3) is simply making faux italics of the Roman
  face, which looks horrible.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    you use.

  body: "Geoff --\r\n\r\nKarsten gave me a heads-up about your need. (Thanks, Karsten.)\r\n\r\nFont
    Bureau, of course, did all the final production on my Whitman fonts. It doesn't
    seem to be FB's practice to style link their font families -- probably because
    they generally produce large, complex families and sell single instances. \r\n\r\nI
    have generated style-linked suitcases that I have made available to licensed Mac
    users who wanted them. But, unfortunately, I don't know how to do this for the
    Windows fonts.\r\n\r\nAs Karsten suggested, you should contact the Font Bureau.
    If for some reason you don't get a prompt reply or the attention you need, let
    me know and I'll see what I can do to help with a solution.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n"
