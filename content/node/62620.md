body: 'My wood type collection has sold! The collection is going to a letterpress
  printer (who prefers to remain anonymous). He intends to create a specimen book
  from the collection, and eventually donate it to a large American printing museum.
  Thank you everyone for all your emails, inquiries and good wishes. I will suggest
  to the buyer that he makes sure to notify Typophile readers when the specimen book
  is done.   '

  body: I think he ought to make a nice coffee table book with big glossy pictures
    of them all too. They're so lovely! Nice to hear it's all in good hands anyway.
