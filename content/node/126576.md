body: I'm in the process of creating new marketing materials and product silk-screening
  for a start-up I have been at for the past 12 months.  Unfortunately, no one is
  still around, who knows what font was used for our company logo.  I tried some of
  the online font search engines without any success.  If anyone can identify the
  font used for "SafeKey" in our company logo, I would greatly appreciate it.
