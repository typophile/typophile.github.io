body: "I have drawn some illustrations for a novel. I already have scanned them but
  I actually cannot find the right way to \u201Cclean\u201D them in order to print
  them as a part of the book. I do not want to create a vector of them using AI because
  I will lost the \u201Chandmade\u201D part of it. So I tried to use brush tool to
  clean them but I am not sure if this will work quite alright for what is needed.
  The style of the drawings  have something of the engraving art. If someone can help
  me solve this out I will be glad. "

    run poster edges and then covert to one bit. This will give you a nice engraved
    look.\r\n\r\nProcess:\r\n1. Convert Photo to Grayscale.\r\n2. Run Artistic/Poster
    Edges Filter at 1 for Thickness,\r\n6 for Intensity and 2 for Posterization.\r\n3.
    Use Image Adjust Threshold to fine tune your\r\nSketch.\r\n4. Convert to Bitmap
    using Diffusion Dither."
