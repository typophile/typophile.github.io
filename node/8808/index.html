		<div class="commentbody">so, we can't try to start again here! John Hudson posted a question on the chat: Do we need to speak the language to design a good font or something like that? <BR> <BR>I think so in some way. As we dream our letterforms in word of our own language, I'm pretty sure we don't see letters in same way, for their proportion and so on. <BR> <BR>This remind me a personal experience. When I have designed Bienvenue, I never realised that the a is pretty narrow, because the combination of it started with teh word France Telecom, and naturally the fitting was good until, couple months later, I realised that it was too narrow. I dreamed too much of the a in a context.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">{Changing my torn-up clothes&hellip;} <BR> <BR>JF, it's great to see &quot;linguistic sensitivity&quot;! <BR> <BR>In your nice page with the illustrations there are some interesting things about letterform width with respect to language. I also wonder about two other things: <BR> <BR>1) Variations in vertical proportions. <BR>2) Variations in spacing. <BR> <BR>For #1, I would point out your figure #5, and note that German relies more on extenders than either French or English. Does that mean German needs a smaller x-height? Especially when you also consider that German words are longer (and a smaller x-height would allow for less overall width of words)? This can also be considered for Latinate languages that use a lot of accents - which is one reason Bilak's Eureka has a small x-height. <BR> <BR>For #2, I would point to your figure #2, and note that German seems to have more x-height verticals in proportion to rounds - does that affect &quot;default&quot; spacing? <BR> <BR>(Man, I'm actually glad I didn't have to type that over 20 lines in a chat room&hellip;) <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Start with German versus French. In 1997, I realized that German use more variety/various letterforms than French. More ascenders glyphs in various combinaisons, when french use most of the time similar letters, with in some respect, more descenders, in fact very flat language physically speaking. So, German type need to be more straight, more regular to control all the letters togethers. The various forms achieve the rhythm, when in French, the same typeface can quicky be very boring, because French is naturally too flat</div>

Now that I see it, it's obvious. <BR> <BR>The left column shows the freqency of characters without extenders (ascenders) and the right column shows the frequency of ascenders for each language shown.

		<div class="commentbody">My question was a little more precise than JFP's summary. I know from experience that it is possible to design good typefaces for <i>scripts</i> that one cannot read. But I'm wondering how far, within a script, a designer can go to addressing the particular nuances of the ways individual languages use that script? <BR> <BR>Ironically, I see in JFP's illustrations the beginnings of an analytical, empirical approach to the question. Look, they seem to say, you can collect data, you can observe different frequencies of different kinds of letters in different languages, you can measure (optically if not mathematically) the impact of these frequencies on text. And you can do all this without knowing how to speak any of the languages. <BR> <BR>[Of course, this ignores all the purely cultural aspects of typography: the things that make French books look French even when they contain English texts.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">English use many round letter forms when German less, Joe.

		<div class="commentbody"><i>I think theses differences are built by designers without noticing what they do</i>  <BR>  <BR>Right, but recognising this is the first step to noticing and controlling what you do. I'm sure, if one only ever <i>looks at</i> one language in print, that is all you will ever imagine. But I think it is enough to look, not necessarily to be able to read, at a diversity of languages in order to begin to appreciate the differences and to respond to them.  <BR>  <BR>An interesting thought: if a client came to me and said 'I want you to design a typeface, and it will only ever be used to print text in German', what would I do differently?  I think I would begin by going and looking closely at a lot of German text, so the approach to designing for individual languages is quite similar to designing for different scripts.  <BR>  <BR>Of course, most of the time, we're not designing for individual languages, but in the reasonable belief that a typeface is going to be used for multiple languages. This is even more the case these days, with Unicode and OpenType encouraging extension of Latin script typefaces for central Europe, Turkey, Africa, Vietnam, etc.  <BR>  <BR>So here's a question: do type designers try to make 'neutral' multilingual fonts, try to compromise to accomodate the features of different languages, or do type designers each have a kind of personal platonic language in their heads for which they instinctively design?  <BR>  <BR>Oddly, if I have such a language in my head, for which I instinctively design, I'm not sure that it is English. Maybe Latin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John: I pretty sure you make your own analyse of the focused language. <BR> <BR>Take Erik Spiekermann types. There all are quite narrow, square with very large s. large top e counters, large a counter, narrow n, etc. I'm pretty sure he don't see all of &quot;his mistakes&quot; (the features I see as mistakes because I'm french! not because I better than him on typeface design!!!!). Remember the number of time when you say that my a are too narrow and French&hellip; hum (quiet perfect to me!) <BR> <BR>I refer to something beyond your control. its not scientific, its just because we are human with difference. <BR> <BR>Little in same way as a Sumner Stone typeface is very round and soft, quiet (as him, soft, quiet guy!). <BR> <BR> <BR>Univers has been designed to fit German Italian French English perfectly. The result is the page is quite boring! Just look at his books with three columns three languages in same Univers. <BR> <BR>What can be fun is to apply languages features for OpenType with various letterforms depending of the language used!!! WGL4 with this feature (who make the double work &ndash; without considering the size feature) can be very fun to do ;-) <BR> <BR></div>
