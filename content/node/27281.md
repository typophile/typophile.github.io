body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is my first post here, I've been browsing here for
  a while - but recently came accross a problem I think you guys can help me out with.\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on a tutorial site right now (idexity.com) based off of wordpress (heavily
  modified of course :) ). Right now I'm at the logo stage and have a logo I'm pretty
  happy with, <strong>however</strong> I don't like the font I'm currently using.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for suggestions for a font to use, that would go along better with the 'infinity'
  symbol I created.  The 'X' in 'IDEXITY' is made from the over-lapping lines in the
  symbol I made, so maybe a font that takes on the shape of that 'X'\r\n\r\nThanks
  everyone, I'm excited to hear your suggestions\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/random/idexityLogo.jpg\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: Can you be more specific about why you don't like this font - in other words
    what does it fail to convey. That would help us make suggestions for you.

    more and has a 'smarter' look to it, without being the generic tech looking font...\r\n\r\nHope
    that help,\r\nMike"

  body: first off, I'd comment that if you hadnt told me the name was IDEXITY I wouldnt
    even have known, as it looks like IDEITY. So I would concenrtate on making that
    more clear. The "X" as you have it appears as more of a symbol. I would pull it
    smaller and call-out the x within the path, graphically, as asuggestion. Then,
    using a font like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.117386.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=IDEXITY&sampleSize=48"><strong>Neo-Sans</strong></a>
    might help you on the text to match your needs.

  body: "I actually read it as \"IDENTITY\" because the 'X' looks a little like an
    'N' (with the downward diagonal stroke so prominent) and my brain filled in the
    'T'. I agree that the 'X' needs to be clearer.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    if you adjusted the width, but without the infinity symbol closing I think reading
    an X there is always going to be a problem,\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/britannic/\r\n\r\nTim"
