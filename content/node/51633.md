    wonderful brush font that includes a special 'words' set, and this is what this
    reminded me of so you might also be interested in Bello:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=bello&id2=words\">Bello

  body: "That's really close to the direction I'm looking for. Do you (or anyone else)
    know if there is a type term used for these kind of \"word\" sets? I know I've
    heard of it, but it's escaping my mind right now.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

    As far as I know, they are just called "words" or "word logos".
