body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm a really newbie when it comes to design processes and
  I have yet to figure out the trick to make amazing textures in graphic and illustrative
  pieces. Pieces like these from Mikey Burton and Dan Cassaro with this gritty, xerox
  type texture are amazing and something I am trying mimic in a piece I'm working
  on. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any tips, suggestion or can point me in the right direction
  of a tutorial  of how to accomplish this? Is it all photoshop or is there some sort
  of special transparency trick in illustrator I am missing?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, there's a bit of lettering in one of the images \u2026 maybe that counts
    \u2026\r\n\r\nIs it Illustrator or Photoshop? I wouldn't know, but if I were going
    to do it, I wouldn't use either. Make the texture using real-world materials and
    photograph it. I recently did a grunge logo, not by messing with the vectors in
    Illustrator, but by printing the clean logo, crumpling it, dampening it, stomping
    on it, rubbing pencil shavings all over it, etc. It looks great. The best way
    to do this kind of thing is to actually do it.\r\n\r\nThe texture in the first
    image looks like a letterpressed plate. So maybe you should design your image,
    have it made into plates, print it letterpress on rough paper, and photograph
    it. Or, better yet, if you're designing for print, let the letterpress piece be
    your final product."

  body: Such textures are widely available on stock photography sites, and can be
    overlayed in photoshop via blend modes.

  body: "The blue one looks like it might be a photo of a dirty wall surface that
    was combined in Photoshop with the illustration (each put on a different Photoshop
    layer and then combined using blend modes). As vilbel said, textures are widely
    available. Many sites offer free textures, and commercial sites like iStockPhoto
    have tons of them for a few bucks apiece (one nice thing about a commercial site
    like iStockPhoto is their search engine that lets you find textures by description,
    colors, etc.). And a Google search will turn up many sites devoted to textures
    techniques.\r\n\r\nThe other graphic looks to me that the texture was drawn as
    part of the illustration, rather than being an unrelated texture that was overlaid. "

  body: "Thanks everyone\r\n\r\n@hrant I apologize if this is not a purely type specific
    question. I thought posting in the general design board would be a safe bet and
    in any regard I have always received great help and tips from the forums on typophile,
    thanks for your input.\r\n\r\n@Joshua Langman thats a great idea, ill try that
    out\r\n\r\n@vilbel and Jame M I have tried stock textures already but it still
    does not provide the result I'm looking for, which is why I assumed I must be
    missing a big step that everyone else knows but me. But thank you for the suggestions!\r\n\r\n"

    you like.\r\n\r\nYou then typically apply them by making them monotone (grayscale)
    masks and using various layer blending options to achieve the particular look
    you want. "

    with the way you're applying them. Can you post an example of a graphic where
    you applied a texture and didn't like the result?\r\n\r\n(My guess is that you're
    just using the textures in a subtractive way as a mask to delete or obscure portions
    of your graphic, but in the examples you posted that you liked they were using
    textures in both an additive and subtractive way.)\r\n\r\n"
