  body: "I have never tried lasercutting for metal, only high-pressure water cuts,
    which gave quite a nice finish. So far, for me at least, laser is more efficient
    (and cheaper) on softer materials such as acrylics or wood, with acrylics being
    the most efficient due to the problems with wood burning up on small lettering
    use.\r\n\r\nFor letterpress type 3d-printing proves to be the easiest solution
    so far although it needs a lot of work finishing in sanding the edges.\r\n\r\nI
    believe most workspaces (at least the ones that I know of) use lasers for the
    softer materials, but still use water-cuts for metal. At least in the affordable
    range."

  body: "The issue for now 3d printing type is the wearing down. The materials for
    the more \"affordable\" 3d printers are not extremely strong,  and some print
    materials work horrible with inks. If you want a crisp print you won't be able
    to make a huge printing run, the edges will wear down pretty fast. Since most
    prints are made with an extremely rough material getting a crisp edge takes a
    lot of post-processing. Also, because of the rough print, making small type is
    quite impossible.\r\n\r\nI hope I have some time soon in which can experiment
    a bit more with it, since for now my tries have been mostly with checking out
    how to get the best finish for shapes. However, there are industrial printers
    out there that are able to print metal, now that will be something..."
