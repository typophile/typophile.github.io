  \r\nI've been working on recently. Their purpose is to generate\r\ninterest in my
  typo-illustration work.\r\n\r\nIt's the first two images here, 'Sexy as Hell' and
  'Natural Beauty'. \r\n\r\nwww.seblester.co.uk\r\n\r\nWeird, cool, offensive? Just
  plain dull? Any input appreciated.\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\nps. The lettering can be seen
  here too...\r\n\r\nhttp://seblester.co.uk/type_lettering.php"
