  Please critique this font under construction\"), I made some major edits on this
  typeface.\r\n\r\nOne of the main edits was around using a more curvy flairing of
  the lower stems (following crossgrove and dezcom's feedback). \r\n\r\nAlso I updated
  all all the 'bowled' letters of the lower case (b, d, p, q, e, c) as well as all
  the upper case.\r\n\r\nThe input I got was very helpfull and I would appreciate
  any further pointers!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Primus v2_4097.jpg]\r\n\r\n(PDF

    at the curve of \"f\" and \"j\". One of them is too thick or too thin, I think
    it's the \"j\" that needs less weight in the lower part.\r\n\"y\" is too heavy
    in the lower part too.\r\n\r\nsebastian"

  body: "Sebastian,\r\nGood work! Much better! \r\nI wonder about the uppercase U?
    Does it need the flare? I think it probly is better without. It seems to create
    a bump where the U curve meets the stem at left?\r\nI think Mr Nagel is right
    about the j and y tail as well. I would add that both j and y tails seem tocome
    too far left and pull the ballance rest of the glyph over to the right.  There
    is something out of sorts with the lc v and w to me.  They seem rotated a tad
    right.\r\nYour s is lovely but I wonder if those beautiful terminals are the best
    choice to match the rest of the lowercase?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    body: "ChrisL,\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments. I wasn't sure about the U either...
      One the one hand, it adds some quirkyness, but on the other hand, it may be
      inappropriately over the top. I think I may hold on to the flare on the right
      stem and make the left stem straight.\r\n\r\nGood points on the j and y, I will
      give those tails a massage and a joint-crack. \r\n\r\nI think the v and w need
      some balancing as you indicated. Their 'bottoms' are offset to the left after
      operation flare.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on the lc s terminal? Originally, I
      had straight, i.e. pen-nib style serifs (see image), and after reading the thread
      on the development of 'Fejoia', I went for the 'brushy' kind of serifs. \r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_4735.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Sebastian,\r\n\r\nI've been so busy thinking about your feedback on my
    own design that I didn't realize you had one up here as well. I figured I'd give
    it a shot. Remember that I, too, am a beginner, and you shouldn't necessarily
    trust anything I say.\r\n\r\nI think that one of the biggest sources of your lowercase's
    character (and I could be very wrong) is the juxtaposition of the the constructed
    pen-formed serifs and the swooshy, brushy terminals. To me, that's what gives
    your letters like k and x such a distinctive look. Because the brushy terminals
    are consistent throughout the lowercase (a c f j y, and to an extent the legs
    on k and x), I don't see a problem with them on the s, but I do think that they
    should be thickened up a bit, they look weak next to that r. \r\n\r\nIf you're
    going to fully commit to the brushyness, I might start to miss it in the uppercase.
    I only see it on the tails of the J and Q, but it has potential to be on the C,
    G, K, R, S, and the X. Maybe the reason that others want the brushy s to go is
    because it's not present enough in the other characters.\r\n\r\nAnd, just for
    fun, I tried a little mixing and matching of your two s designs to echo the mixing
    of pen and brush that you do elsewhere. A little too weird, though.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pixion_s_5446.png]\r\n\r\nA
    few other notes:\r\n\r\nc: the terminal on your c is too ball-shaped; I want it
    to be more like the one on on your a\r\n\r\ne: this seems to tilt to the right
    because the bottom portion doesn't extend past the top. I know that your g leans
    to an extent too, but your c doesn't and I really want the c and the e to be consistent.\r\n\r\nf:
    I love it, it creates such an interesting countershape over the following letter.\r\n\r\nI
    hope that at least some of this was helpful.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "Hi David,\r\n\r\nI appreciate you feedback!\r\n\r\nYou're right, I think
    I settled on the coexsistence of the pen and brush type terminals. This is also
    used in a number of other typefaces as well (\"Quadraat\" is one that inspired
    me). I think that it may also be 'historical correct' as I can imagine that in
    medieval times letters may have been drafted with a combination of media... (I
    am speculating here).\r\n\r\nI have to play with some of the caps. One reason
    I limited it to lc is that I am affraid that things be become 'too playfull',
    and I want this face to have a 'classy', 'down to earth' but open and energetic
    quality. Using the brushy terminals on the uc may take some 'seriousness' away.\r\n\r\nThe
    hybrid s you drew is interesting. I see your point that the terminals are too
    light, so I made them larger and checked with the a, c, j, y etc. to see if they
    balance. \r\n\r\n(Old / 'light' s on the right)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso the e got some
    straightening, although it still has a bit of the 'forward looking' aspect. Also
    the c got some massage. \r\n\r\nHere a test with some the touched letters.\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_4883.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_3437.jpg]"

  body: "Hey Sebastian,\r\n\r\nI like the changes you've made, and I do see your point
    about keeping the brushy terminals as a special characteristic; overdoing it would
    take away some of the seriousness that you mentioned. I think that the c and the
    e are much better related now, and the terminal on the c matches the rest of the
    font.\r\n\r\nThe lc s is improved, I think, but I think it's lost some of its
    openness. Is there a way to keep the added weight on those terminals, but not
    close of the counterspace so much? It also feels like it's tilting backwards now;
    you can see that especially in the detail image you posted. The original s leans
    slightly forward (like your e and g) and your new one tilts the other way. I'd
    try to go back to the original slant where the bottom terminal sticks out to the
    left of the top stroke. \r\n\r\nThat's all for now, I think.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"
