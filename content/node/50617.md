body: "Today I was re-reading Updike on the subject of Van Dyck and Elsevier fonts
  he says:\r\n\r\n<em>\"In these old fonts, too, there were more unusual and tied
  letters than are now common.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThis is on page 21 of Printing Types
  Vol 2, in a reprint from 1962, the 3rd edition. \r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose he means
  by this?  What I think of are a) contextual shapes, and b) Type with two glyphs
  on it like a linotype logotype. But It may be that there are other possibilities.\r\n\r\nBecause
  I have started to see what looks like contextual shapes in a Plantin face I am especially
  wondering if this is what he means and if there might be some metal evidence at
  the Museum Plantin-Moretus.\r\n\r\nHere is a small sample of the Plantin most kindly
  photographed and sent to me by Wolfgang Mayer (wmayer at typophile.com)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plantintwoa_4767.png]\r\n\r\nhere
  is some of the cover page:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coverpage_4055.jpg]"

  body: "Eben\r\n\r\nas far as I can see, Updike relates with those words to the italics
    (Kanon cursijf and Paragon cursijf) mentioned some lines before \u2013 see page
    20. If you look at Ill. 201 (between page 14 and 15), you will find a lot of unusual
    ligatures besides the usual ones (st sp ct ss st etc and so on) and the swashes
    in the type. \r\n\r\nThere is a \"us\" in line 1: Largus, a \"as\" in proprias,
    a \"ta\" in line 2: monimenta, a \"at\" in line 3: Illustrat, a \"is\" in line
    9: Sudantis, and I'm sure there are a lot more of those ligatures. Although the
    example is taken from a 1616 imprint, the type was in use at least from 1575 onwards.
    There are also a lot of swashy alternate capitals in this type.\r\n\r\nSo I think
    Updike speaks mostly of those elements.\r\n\r\nwolfgang\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rc-updike-201_3859.jpg]\r\n\r\nPart

  body: 'I think you are jumping too far in associating Updike''s ''unusual'' with
    specifically ''contextual shapes'', enamoured as you are of the latter. Linking
    obviously refers, as you note, to the various ligated letters: ff us et ta ll
    st etc. as illustrated in your second post. But note also the scribal abbreviation
    in ferroque in line eight, which doubtless Updike would have classified with ''unusual'',
    along with swash forms, and perhaps even the long s. Unusual means ''unusual to
    Updike''s time and taste'', of course, not unusual to the makers or users of the
    original type.'

    also the Greek letters, for spelling reform.\r\nAll very experimental.\r\n\r\nThere
    was a lot of interest in italics during the 16th century, whole books were printed
    in them.\r\nBut eventually it transpired that mixing roman and italic was a more
    useful complexity than trying to parse the effect of calligraphy.\r\nBut as long
    as typefounders were wrapping their heads around such complexity, perhaps some
    of the contextuality rubbed off on their treatment of roman? Keep looking...\r\n\r\nThat
    title page is engraved. "

  body: "Re-reading I see that you must be correct Wolfgang!  Probably the excitement
    of the funny shapes in the Van de Keere/Plantin Roman got the better of me. I
    must learn to write after I have had enough sleep. \r\n\r\nThe italics are really
    fun. I have not spent nearly enough time looking at italics. I have been seeing
    a lot of connected/ligatured italics this week in the MATD Reading collections. "
