  to find a typeface that closely matches the image above. It is a recent photograph
  of a sign that was created close to 30 years ago. The \"R\" is rather unique, but
  I can't seem to find a typeface that matches. Caslon and Jenson are close, but not
  quite right.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBill"

  body: "It's a large, brass cast sign (3-feet by 9-feet?). The letters are raised,
    with the background dark. I converted the image to grayscale, upped the contrast,
    then inverted it to make the letters easier to read. I'm thinking it's not a standard
    print typeface, but something the sign makers had in their repertoire.\r\n\r\nRevival
    565 looks pretty darn close (though not quite). But I can still call that one
    a winner with a bit of modification!\r\n\r\nThanks!"
