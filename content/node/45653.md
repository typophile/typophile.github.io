    s in 'cafes' isn't quite the same.  It's a bit hard to tell with the image being
    as small as it is.  I'm guessing the outline on the word 'Feb' is probably not
    a part of the font itself, having been added after.\r\n\r\nJH"

    and the \"\xB4\", maybe is customized but we never know :)\r\n\r\n"
