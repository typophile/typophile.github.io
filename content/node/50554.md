  only a jpg image and i'm trying to get the smallest file size possible for screen
  display.\r\nMy question is what would be the best way to do it. \r\nWould it be
  using the save for web in photoshop and lowering the jpg quality, or would it be
  best to use a high quality jpg and reduce the image quality in the pdf export settings
  in Indesign?\r\n\r\nI tried both ways, and the results opticaly look practicly the
  same, but the advantage of photoshop is that it presents a lot more options available
  using the save for web command.\r\nAnyway, it's always nice to now how professionals
  usually do.\r\n\r\nHope i'm being clear enough.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nRegards

    in the PDF export window. I don't know if this makes the smallest PDF possible,
    but small enough for me.\r\n\r\nBut if the outcome is really important for you
    in this case, I would just try the different options you describe, and see which
    method is the most convenient / best. :)"

  body: "yeah i came across a similar problem when i worked on an online literary
    journal. i find saving postscript files and converting them with distilller helps
    a lot. you can even create your own compression script (called .joboptions i think)
    in distiller to specify just where you want to 'squeeze' the compression rates
    and whatever. just go into distiller > settings > edit adobe pdf settings and
    a dialog box comes up with options.\r\n\r\nthen just make sure when you save as
    you call it something different to the joboption file you based it on. \r\n\r\nif
    you've never used distiller before it's not very complicated. after you've saved
    the ps file, open distiller, choose the setting from the drop down box (which
    you should've made a new setting for, or else pick one of the defaults) and drag
    the ps file into distiller.\r\n\r\nvoila. i garauntee it'll be smaller than the
    same file as an exported pdf."

  body: oh, and to save the postscript file you have to go through the file > print
    dialog window. it'll have it as an option under the printer choice.

  body: "Saving to the smallest filesize as Quincunx  suggested is a pretty good start.
    You could also change the compatibility to Acrobat 6, it makes the file size a
    bit smaller, and most people have Acrobat 6 by now.\r\nChanging compression options
    at the Export pdf dialogue window helps, too (from the small file default 150
    to 72 dpi, for example)\r\n\r\nIt all depends what your needs are, the Photoshop
    save for web option isn't a bad option, either."

    from Photoshop, bypassing InD entirely?</cite>\r\n\r\n:) i'm not building a pdf
    with just one jpg inside, it was just an example to simplier explain my point.\r\n\r\n@Thenquin\r\n\r\nYeah,
    i'll certainly give it a try using a .ps file, never thought it could help to
    reduce the file size compared to a exported pdf.\r\n\r\nI guess i'll just keep
    testing those different aproaches and see what best works in this case. \r\n\r\nThanks
    again\r\nSeeya"
