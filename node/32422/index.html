<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm working on a game and would like the ability to use different fonts to add atmosphere. The game is setting-independent, so anything that would add to the ambiance if used in the right context is good. Something calligraphic for a fantasy adventure setting, something computerish for digital readouts in a modern or sci-fi setting, and so forth. But here's the catch: I don't want the style to be too pronounced.
While searching the links on this site I came across the "shamcil" font, which at first glance seemed good for a fantasy adventure setting. But after testing it I found a problem:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_4932.gif]
This font can be difficult to read, at least at 12-point. I need something about halfway between this and plain block letters - the style should be just pronounced enough to catch the player's eye and make him think "nice touch," but not so much that someone used to plain text would have any trouble reading it.
I need fonts that come in 12-point (or very close to it). And I'm working on a shoestring budget, so if a font isn't free for commercial use it needs to be very cheap (no more than a dollar or two per usable font).
So, any recommendations? Any help is appreciated.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, I noticed that all the commercial fonts I saw out there were at least 5 to 6 dollars minimum (and most far more than that). I'm not trying to undervalue their work, I just really don't have that kind of money and didn't want to waste anybody's time by failing to make that clear. I figured freeware would be all I'd actually get.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I understand. I am most definitely a newbie when it comes to fonts, and it's kind of hard for a newbie to NOT have misconceptions that the more experienced will find amusing. In ANY field. :)
I'm more worried about not having gotten any recommendations yet, given how fast I got help in the other thread I started. Did I explain what I was after poorly, or are there just not a lot of fonts out there that fit the bill?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks. I found several interesting-looking fonts there.
After testing with some of them, though, it turns out that the idea I had for using them is simply not practical. So, no more recommendations are needed. Thanks anyway, everyone.</div>
