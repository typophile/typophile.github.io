  nor logo designing.\r\n    However I was asked to help with a logo design for a
  new small company wanting\r\n    to market fruit pulp which will be used to make
  'homemade' smoothies.\r\n    I thought the Pump typeface was friendly and echoed
  somehow fruit forms.\r\n\r\n    I wonder if you could help with some suggestions\r\n
  \   Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to start from scratch, and you don't believe you're good at designing logos, I
    think you need to hire a logo pro."

    first step is to go to a site like myfonts.com, search for, say, \"fruit\"...
