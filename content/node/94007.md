    the need to define such a specific and local term? In these cases I can only favor
    the use of metaphorical designations. They taste better.

  body: Since architectural terminology is used for descriptors such as a single-storey
    'a' and a double-storey 'g', how about "split-level" ?

    has nothing to do with split personality syndromes in human psychology. Other,
    less informed posters in these forums have in the past made the same error. Let's
    correct this here and now.\r\n\r\nFortunately Craig posted a relevant reference---\r\n\r\n\"Does
    Schizophrenia Mean Split Personality?\"\r\n\r\nNo!\r\n\r\n@T\xE9: \"roofed\".
    You mean the vertex of a gable roof?\r\n\r\n@HVB: No. Split level involves a jarred
    separation of level like a stair or staircase.\r\n\r\n@LexLuengas: <em>What about

    the heck not? You ask why do something--why *not* do it? The world does not revolve
    around you. This is a discussion, and you're being uncool, and that sucks. So
    let it go.\r\n\r\n<em>If you can't help it then just---leave it alone. Yeah, just

    does to the lowercase and figures to know if it is really this simple.  I'll bet
    some more slight modifications like what was done on the A would be necessary.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith
    the exception of raising the cross bar of the A and straightening its lower legs,
    this Geometric Effect could be done on any font.  Really it would be easy to write
    a function in coreldraw that take a complete font, run this effect on each glyph,
    and presto.  Can't really say that for the Circus example."

    effects a font can have.  I can think of the rotalics, for one.  http://typophile.com/node/93061
    \ Surely there are dozens of others.\r\n\r\nTo me this term would relate to a
    type design that is already complete, and then taken through a simple set of transformations.
    \ So, quite possible not part of the original design ideas."
