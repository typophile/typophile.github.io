  body: I thint this actually <em>is</em> just a modified Harabara (with, among other
    things, flipped a for e).

  body: Thank you everyone for the ID.  I suspect that riccard0 is right, and this
    is hand-modified into a logotype based on Harabara.  The campaign graphics package
    was consistent across everything (signs, handouts, buttons, online) making me
    think this was professionally done.  A true rarity in local politics ;)
