body: Is there a set of rules for the use of AE and OE ligatures in English? I realize
  that modern English does not use these ligatures, but if I chose to use them, would
  I substitute them for EVERY occurrence of &#34;ae&#34; and &#34;oe&#34;, or would
  it be selective? <BR>e.g. what if the &#39;o&#39; and the &#39;e&#39; belong to
  separate syllables?

    as a single vowel. Their use in modern English is largely limited to words of
    French origin, but they can now always be replaced by the sequences ae and oe.
    Conversely, they cannot be used in all contexts that ae and oe occur. Languages
    with phonetic spelling systems typically treat all combinations of two vowels
    as diphthongs unless marked otherwise by a diaeresis; English, with its etymological
    spelling system, does not have this consistency and generally fails to visually
    distinguish diphthongs.  <BR>  <BR>Traditionally, the '
