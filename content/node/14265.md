body: Can we get a Typophile Widget for Mac OS X's Dashboard? Would that not just
  totally rock? How much effort is needed to program a widget?

  body: "I've got 2 of these in the works at the current time. Both are fully functional
    but need a little design refinement.\r\n\r\n1. Smalltalk generator. Remember this
    one? It spews out pretentious things to say at type conferences. I was hoping
    to release this before/at TypeCon but ended up being too busy running to and fro
    to get it out there.\r\n\r\n2. Typophile RSS reader. This aggregates all feeds
    into one stream, but flip it over and you can set it to focus in one any particular
    group (General Discussions, wiki, etc)\r\n\r\nWhat would be the killer widget?
    What does everyone want to see?"

    go that far, I think iChat integration of the Typophile Messenger would be even
    better. (I like to dream big.)"

    Reminds me of a countdown clock I had at Reading which quickly became a distraction
    as I worked furiously on my dissertation.
