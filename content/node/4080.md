    you some useful examples of classical settings as well as some very good advice
    on composition and typographic design in general.

    <BR>Allen Ginsberg&#39;s &#34;Howl&#34; set in 10/11 Baskerville, 1956. <BR>Every
    line of verse is treated as a justified paragraph, with 3 pica hanging indent.
    No hyphenation. Title, Cloister Bold. <BR>&#40;Sample is 30% larger than actual
    size, to show sufficient type detail.&#41;

  body: Nick -- <BR> <BR>That is very unusual. I wonder if the lack of hyphenation
    was an ideological decision by Ginsberg or the typesetter, or what. It makes for
    some very gappy lines. This could introduce an unusual dimension in terms of pacing
    for a certain school of poetry readers, but I can&#39;t imagine it was intended
    by the poet. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>
