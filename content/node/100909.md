  I'm struggling to find a good book on the practical side of it. I'm reading The
  Stroke: Theory of writing but it is what it says on the cover - theory. I was wondering
  if there's some sort of a calligraphy bible that is field tested and approved by
  the community.\r\n\r\nAny guidance would greatly appreciated."

    Charles Pearce: The Anatomy of Letters.\r\n\r\nBoth are wonderful little books
    on calligraphy with varying degrees of instruction."

    If it's the former, Typophile isn't the best place to ask, since it's about type,
    which is essentially different than calligraphy. If it's the latter, Gerrit Noordzij
    is in fact the doyen of chirographic type (although you will actually find a great
    deal of discussion about such things on Typophile).\r\n\r\nThat said, my favorite
    book on calligraphy is Claude Mediavilla's monumental \"Calligraphy\" (which I
    have in the French, but I believe has been made available in an English version
    as well).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Calligraphy and Lettering by Walter Foster which starts with basic calligraphic
    step by step alphabets and moves to unique modern characters. It features four
    lettering artists, one of them being John Stevens which is the reason I personally
    bought the book.'

    This one was the easiest to get my hands on at the moment.\r\n\r\n@hrant I'm perfectly
    aware that this forum is not concerned with calligraphy but I thought I'll try
    my luck here first. It's my go to place when it comes to researching type related
    problems and it worked (:\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

    who happen to be font designers. \r\nCalligraphy is the accepted term!"
