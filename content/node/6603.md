  body: Because of slight variations on the characters, my guess is that a filter
    was applied to Millcreek in Illustrator to create the rough edges. <BR> <BR>Font
    is not ringing a bell, though. <BR> <BR>Harvest looks hand-drawn.

  body: I think Patricia&#39;s right about the filters. <a href="http://lanstontype.com/MitchellKennerley.html">Kennerley</a>
    or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/tc-kingsley-rr/tckingsley-rr-bold/">Kingsley</a>
    are <BR>good starting points.

  body: Look at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Millcreek&amp;search%5Btext%5D=Italian+Old+Style"
    target="_blank">Numbers 1, 2 and 5 on this page</a> &#40;Italian Old Style, Jenson
    and Veronese&#41;. The &#39;k&#39; needs serif clipping and a new dot on the &#39;i&#39;
    &#40;along with the previously mentioned filtering&#41; and you might make a close
    approximation.
