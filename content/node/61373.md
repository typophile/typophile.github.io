body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nFirst time posting to this lovely forum. I've recently began
  delving more deeply into typography, and I find myself hooked. This resume redesign
  of mine was my first project in which type was a serious consideration. I would
  love any sort of commentary or critique\u2013certainly both positive, and negative\u2013
  that you may have to offer. I have attached both the old resume, and the new, for
  comparison purposes. Thank you!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For starters remove most of the content under the column \u201CPersonal\u201D.
    \r\nPut something that describes how you well you work and think- efficient, team
    worker, organized etc.\r\n\r\nMerge the Technical and Creative to just \u201CTechnical\u201D
    or \u201CTechnical & Creative\u201D\r\n\r\nRemove \u201CTypography\u201D because
    you do not make fonts.\r\n\r\nA hierarchy would help too\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC DESIGN:\r\n-
    Illustration\r\n- Page Layout\r\n- Photo Manipulation / Retouching\r\n\r\nThere
    are several other problems too. \r\n\r\nThe top half of your resume places too
    much emphasis on your Adobe skills when your photography is your bread and butter.\r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t like how your using Archer. It add a whimpy, crafty and perhaps even
    girly feel to the resume. You need to come across more powerful. The size of the
    text is too large and the text area is too wide. I would just use the Freight
    Sans or Text\u2014it\u2019s strong but still friendly.\r\n\r\nRemove the Caslon
    ampersands too.\r\n\r\nAnd the big thing you need to fix is your name set in the
    nasty corporate Univers... remove Univers completely.\r\n\r\nThe resume places
    emphasis on where you worked which is not as important as the position you held.\r\n\r\nMikey
    :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nand the grey text is too light... just use all black"

  body: "Hi Joe:\r\n\r\nWhat professional non-system fonts do you already have?\r\n\r\nThus
    far you have Univers, Freight Sans, and Archer.\r\n\r\nHow much of Freight Sans
    do you have? You can stay within that family and you would be excellent. And the
    nice part (if you have the whole system) the page won\u2019t look monotone either.
    Look into Freight Serif\u2014 it matches perfectly.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

    at its worst lowest quality setting:\r\nhttp://www.dardenstudio.com/assets/pdf/freight_sans.pdf\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll
    most likeky be be using the Book weight as it will probably hold up well through
    lousy fax transmissions.\r\n\r\nJust by looking at how well balanced the Book
    is with Semibold you might want to spring for it, but  you can use the Bold\u2014
    no problem.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think you need the serif because the big blocks
    of text you\u2019ve written  under each employer needs to be condensed into 3
    to 5 bullets. This is going to be hard but you have as concise yet just as detail.\r\n\r\nmikey
