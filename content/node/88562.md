body: "Frio is a geometric monoline sans-serif typeface consisting of 15 styles: 5
  weights and 3 widths plus italics. Clean, neutral and technical, Frio was inspired
  by the form of super ellipse and Eurostile by Aldo Novarese. The font contains stylistic
  and contextual alternates, ligatures, discretional ligatures for use in German,
  ornaments and other OpenType features. It supports all the European languages using
  Latin alphabets.\r\n\r\nThe main thing that sets it apart from the other typefaces
  is a possibility of using simple typing combined with stylistic sets to add coloured
  backgrounds to numerals.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lamatas/frio/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Frio_720x360-1_5593.png]"
