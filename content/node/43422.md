    I definitely prefer Scala''s lowercase ''r''.'

    big an alarm? Snooze button or Five-Alarm? Anyway, as long as your name isn't
    JeRRYy, you'll probably be fine."

  body: "Ha :)\r\nYes, I wouldn't like a name that had to be written in mixed case!\r\nI
    just find the shapes distracting. The tail of the J looks weak, the leg of the
    R is a funny shape, the proportions of the Y  are peculiar, the descender on the
    y is unusual and the e seems to be sliding over to the left. \r\nNot exactly a
    fire alarm as otherwise it's really nice. :)"
