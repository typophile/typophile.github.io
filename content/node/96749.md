  seems to work ok in TextEdit and Word but in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop only
  random glyphs appear. \r\n\r\nWhat can be the reason, has anyone else had this Problem?\r\n\r\nI
  was hoping to use it in a layout and it's the closest to Univers Narrow I can find."

    body: "<blockquote>Using CS4</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI have just moved to CS6 and
      so I do not know how representative it will be. The fonts show up in the font
      menu but separated, the bold, bold italic and regular weights/styles appearing
      under \"Archivo Narrow\" and the italic appearing separately as \"ArchivoNarrow-Italic\".\r\n\r\nLooking
      at the font files this appears to be the result of the naming conventions for
      the OT Family Name (TTX: nameID=\"16\") field, which varies as follows for the
      four weights/styles:\r\n\r\nRegular = Archivo Narrow\r\nItalic = Archivo Narrow
      Italic\r\nBold = Archivo Narrow\r\nBold Italic = (none)\r\n\r\nIt should be
      a simple matter of updating the naming metadata to fix the above and have them
      all appear together in the font menu but if you are experiencing an issue with
      missing characters I can replicate the problem or see what might be causing
      it."

    is roughly GBP 6 (\xA35 subscription + about \xA31 for any non-inlusive calls),
    so you could say just under USD 10. \r\n\r\nIf it was possible I'd give you the
    client's details, for you to take up the issue of what font to use on their website
    with them directly. They've asked for something 'similar' to Univers Condensed
    Bold and don't want to pay for any extras, and that's it. \r\n\r\nYour rants don't
    contribute much to the issue. Are you on sales commission or frustrated by low
    sales at the Microfoundry? The designers might be even grateful to have issues
    pointed out \u2013\u2013 maybe?\r\n\r\nI've just sent an email with a screen shot

  body: "The left screenshot shows Archivo Narrow with its glyphs sorted by Glyph
    Index, not by Unicode (which ought to have been the only setting for Illustrator).\r\n\r\nI
    find something strange in v1.002, quite possible related, or the immediate cause.
    The <code>cmap</code> table, determining the mapping between Unicode and font
    glyphs, seems correct for Platform 0 (Unicode) and Platform 3 (Windows). A snippet:\r\n\r\n<pre>U+003E
    = greater   U+003F = question   U+0040 = at   U+0041 = A\r\nU+0042 = B   U+0043
    = C   U+0044 = D   U+0045 = E\r\nU+0046 = F   U+0047 = G   U+0048 = H   U+0049
    = I</pre>\r\n\r\nHowever, for Platform 1 (Macintosh encoding), I see this:\r\n\r\n<pre>U+0005
    = B   U+0006 = C   U+0007 = D   U+0008 = E\r\nU+0009 = F   U+000A = G   U+000B
    = H   U+000C = I\r\nU+000D = J   U+000E = K   U+000F = L   U+0010 = M\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see, totally the wrong Unicodes. Most surprising of this is that Illustrator
    CS4 prefers a Macintosh encoding, even on a Windows system :^)\r\n\r\nThis problem
    cannot be fixed by a font user, it's up to the designer to repair it."

    for you!\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Your rants don't contribute much to the issue.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    disagree. You might have no idea how much advantage people take of the \"font
    scene\" just to save a few bucks. Like on Typophile we get so many requests for
    a font identification that's clearly meant to help track down a pirated copy...
    This isn't that kind of site - quite the contrary. Unlike cellphone service and
    food for example, fonts are easy to be a cheapskate on. BTW, I wouldn't say I'm
    \"frustrated\" (especially since I'm not big on the retail market) it's more a
    matter of defending something I value, which is not a useless endeavor.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Jens is right: you're effectively paying more now (time is money) to fix a problem
    you could have avoided by spending a modest amount of money in advance (even if
    your client refuses to pay for it). Does Omnibus Type appreciate the free testing
    you're doing for  them? Of course. But your client isn't paying for that either!\r\n\r\nYour
    client is quite probably a cheapskate. I certainly appreciate that saying \"no\"
    to a client is tricky business. But don't blame people like me for pointing out
    that you've placed yourself in an unenviable situation.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Asking
    for some quick advice online (my initial post) can be very valuable</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIndeed.
    But don't stop at listening only to <em>technical</em> advice.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
