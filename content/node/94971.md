  body: "Actually, given the relatively simple solutions, there is no compelling reason
    to believe that these samples were NOT hand-lettered by a reasonably competent
    craftsman. And, given the usage and the likelihood that this lettering was silk-screened
    onto the car, I have MORE compelling reasons to believe that I am right. As if
    I needed any more reasons. Well, okay: more like excuses, but what are you going
    to do?\r\n\r\nI did a couple fonts, based on similar sources, which are \u201Ckind
    of like\u201D your samples, but nowhere near close enough for a cigar."
