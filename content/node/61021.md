  body: You can see the typeface in use <a href="http://www.kah-bonn.de/index_e.htm">here</a>.
    Since it seems to be the corporate typeface of the German Federal Art Gallery
    in Bonn, I doubt it has ever been available for licencing.

    bad Bonn is exclusive tho, it has a really lovely deco feeling. I never like Typeface
