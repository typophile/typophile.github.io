  (UK TV listings magazine) through the 60s?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RT60sBillings_4904.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've
  tried to include as many useful characters as I can. Of particular note are the
  distinctive tail on the Q, pointed middle of the M, full width centre bar of the
  E, thin crossbars of the t and f, and upward flick of the t's tail.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks\r\n\r\nPaul"
