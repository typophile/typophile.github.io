body: "I was finishing my daily practice of lettering and knocked out the word \"Letters\"
  I was about to throw away the piece when I thought it would make a cool design.
  This is what I ended up with. It pretty much sums up how I feel. For those interested
  it was lettered with a 1/4\" Langnickel 6076 Nocturna brush and showcard paint.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letters-are-my-Life-type_5729.jpg]\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n-Charles

  body: It would look great even white on red or black on white (or vice versa) without
    the drop shadow. I hope I am not too presumptious, criticising is always way too
    easy :)

    Then I scanned in the lettering and outlined it in illustrator. Next I added the
