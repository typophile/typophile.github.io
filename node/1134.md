body: I have a client who&#39;s logo is rendered in all caps.  That in itself is fine,
  but they also demand for the name be written in all caps all the time.  So in body
  text when referring to the company name it has to be written as UNICON rather than
  Unicon. <BR> <BR>Visually it&#39;s not very functional.  Seems too aggressive and
  undermines the strength of the overall visual identity system that I&#39;m developing.
  <BR> <BR>Does anyone have any thoughts on this issue?  Have you ever dealt with
  this type of thing?  What are some strong arguments to made for losing it? <BR>

  body: All caps settings have been proven harder to read. Perhaps thats a good approach?
    <BR> <BR>Would they be willing to let you use &#40;real&#41; small caps in type
    settings? It wont help with readability, but it&#39;d be visually less offensive.
    Might help if the client is being a wee bugger and refusing to budge?

  body: 'The logotype is a graphic, not text. That&#39;s the bottom line.  <BR> <BR>I
    had this problem years ago, working for an organization that was changing its
    name &amp; identity. The new logotype was all-lowercase. Everyone thought they
    had to write the org&#39;s name that way. I&#39;m not sure why it was so hard
    to get them to understand the difference between the graphical treatment and the
    name itself, but it took a long time to get it to sink in. I stressed the difference
    between the logotype, which is a graphic &#40;like a picture, I said&#41;, and
    the name itself. I pointed out Boeing&#39;s logotype, which is in all caps: when
    you refer to Boeing do you write BOEING? I even resorted to using the Coca-Cola
    logotype: If you refer to Coca-Cola, do you type it in red curly script? I think
    that last one finally helped. <BR>'

  body: True small caps would be a great solution. They get to feel  <BR>special,
    you get to keep your text in order. <BR> <BR>JetBlue had a similar identity crisis
    early on, when  <BR>everybody thought the official spelling was jetBlue, since  <BR>that
    was the logo treatment. &#40;Which is another topic  <BR>entirely.&#41; <BR> <BR>adidas
    is an example where it is supposed to be set all  <BR>lowercase, all the time.
    Odd.

  body: 'The mention of Adidas &#40;is the name itself really supposed to be lc, like
    e.e. cummings?&#41; reminds me: around the same time, I collected a bunch of all-lc
    logos and made a handout showing that lots of companies have that kind of logotype,
    but that names &#40;i.e. proper nouns&#41; are always written with initial caps
    and internal lc. If it would be useful, I&#39;ll see if I can dig it up. <BR>
    <BR>Re: small caps -- I don&#39;t know what kind of company Nathan&#39;s client
    is, but it&#39;s pretty doubtful that they&#39;d be able to use small caps company-wide
    in all applications &#40;that is, people writing or typing the company name, as
    opposed to printing the logo&#41;.'

  body: Yep, small caps would pose a logistical problem.  And would likely not be
    adapted company wide. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also not sure if visually I agree with
    any caps at all -- except in the logo. <BR> <BR>I like the readability point --
    any hard data I can point to for that? <BR> <BR>Another thing to consider is the
    headlines used in corporate literature.  They use an endorsed brand architecture
    similar to that of redhat or adobe &#40;ie. Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop,
    etc.&#41; <BR> <BR>What you&#39;ll notice is the corporate signature is not integrated
    into the actual headline, but is used to sign the page.  The headline is arranged
    with secondary type only so the corporate name is displayed with secondary type
    consistent with the product name. <BR> <BR>Sometimes these branding architectures
    for headlines use a cascading model where you would also see a tagline. <BR> <BR>So
    my problem is also in developing a consistent look that communicates things correctly.  Having
    the company name as caps &#40;i.e. UNICON Product&#41; takes the focus away from
    the product.  Which is not consistent with the brand architecture strategy they&#39;re
    going with. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts on this? <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: This is actually one rare place where a unicase design &#40;assuming we&#39;re
    really talking about a logo and not orthography&#41; might work great. It would
    satisfy some of the &#34;UC envy&#34;, but also force a clean break with the idea
    that the capitalization has to be the same in text &#40;since a unicase would
    make that effectively impossible&#41;. <BR> <BR>As for the lower readability of
    all-caps, there is empirical evidence all over the place, but it doesn&#39;t apply
    to a single word you have all the time in the world to read. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    issue, not a visual design one. <BR> <BR>What does all-caps say to the &#34;user&#34;,
    and why is it bad &#40;if it is&#41; in this case? <BR>It doesn&#39;t matter if
    it&#39;s smallcaps or not - that&#39;s just typesetting. <BR> <BR>&#62; Seems
    too aggressive and undermines the strength of the overall visual identity system
    that I&#39;m developing. <BR> <BR>Or maybe your design isn&#39;t aggressive enough
    for them? If they like both, then they have to think about what they really like/need
    some more... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: This confusion between the concepts of &#34;name&#34; and &#34;logotype&#34;
    seems common. I&#39;ve even had clients who always tried writing their name in
    their logo font and colour &#40;a la the Coca-Cola example&#41;, or even sticking
    their logo into bodies of text in place of a name! I keep reading, in magazines,
    designers who say that clients are &#34;getting smarter&#34;. I don&#39;t think
    so. <BR> <BR>Part of the problem may be that logo/identity designers aren&#39;t
    providing logo <i>and</i> editorial guidelines for new company names and identities.
    Editorial guidelines will say what the company&#39;s name actually is, and how
    it is to be spelled. <BR> <BR>Remind your client that a logo is a <i>symbol</i>,
    not a word, even if it has letters in it. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: Not sure how you&#39;re separating a branding issue from a visual design one.
    <BR> <BR>My view is that it&#39;s all visual communications &#40;and more when
    considering branding / brand strategy&#41;.  Since there are both implicit and
    explicit messages to any visual communication program, having technical issues
    with the visual design can imply negative messages about the company. <BR> <BR>My
    view, based on my connection with the company vision, is that it&#39;s more a
    crutch than anything else.  They want it to stand out.  But it doesn&#39;t integrate
    elegantly into the overall design system.  But, when dealing with folks on the
    business side of the fence, it&#39;s not always easy to make a case for elegant
    design.  So I was wondering if anyone has come across this issue and what if any
    tactics they used to deal with it. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Nathan

  body: Dunno how receptive they are to plain logic, but it&#39;s a simple and accepted
    rule of usage that proper nouns are written with initial caps, not all caps. When
    a company name appears in all caps, one assumes it&#39;s an acronym, and will
    then wonder what the initials stand for. <BR> <BR>Writing in all caps is like
    adding extra exclamation points. It doesn&#39;t say &#34;this is extra important&#34;
    -- it says &#34;we know <i> you</i> don&#39;t think this is as important as <i>
    we</i> think it is.&#34;

    The back of a business card, white ink, six point, maybe.  <BR> <BR>But what is
