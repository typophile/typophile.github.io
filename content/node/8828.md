  the moderator&#40;s&#41; is &#40;are&#41;, so I can ask privately. <BR> <BR>Charles

    threads.

  body: I wonder if he means the thread about sending fonts to service bureaus that
    was moved to the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4102/63409.html?1106592885">Release
    section</a> earlier today. I thought it was removed until I figured out that it
    was just moved.

  body: Ah. Well, as a rule I always try to post a notice of thread relocation before
    I move it, both privately to the person who started the thread and publicly in
    the thread. If I wait too long after I send out a notice I forget to move it.
    :^/ Nobody&#39; perfect. Sorry folks.

    And there is notice there -- but I didn&#39;t think to go &amp; look. <BR> <BR>Cheers,
