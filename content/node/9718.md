  body: Boeing uses a proprietary font called Stratos for most of their official lettering
    and logo uses. I think these numbers are from that font. &#40;I was a Boeing employee
    for 32 years&#41;.

    close enough for your purposes. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/leviathan/charset.html"
