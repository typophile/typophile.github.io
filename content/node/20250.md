  hardware is in a category of its own. Well, now there's a site for the tech voyeur
  in all of us...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.unboxing.com/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC00109_5276.JPG]\r\n\r\nAnd
  a link to my Flickr pics of opening the new MacBook...\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/joepemberton/tags/macbook/\r\n\r\nThanks
  Nancy for the link."
