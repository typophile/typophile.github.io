  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m currently working with a client who&rsquo;s main corporate font is Linotype Didot including the ornaments cuts. As it was a relatively new font for me I started to gather inspiration on usage around the web (mainly Vogue &amp; Google images) to look at styling and layout compositions.
One of our recent proposals included usage of some Didot ornaments, more in a abstract decorative manner and I&rsquo;m keen to study this area further.</p>
<p>Would anyone know of any online resource or even books I could purchase on modern/contempory usage of Didot ornaments? If nothing so specific any suggestions for further reading?</p>
<p>Many thanks,
Hugo</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Akira Kobayashi&rsquo;s FF Acanthus has some good neoclassical ornamentation.</p>
<p>But surely the point of the Didone (modern) style was a spartan classicism.
The only ornament really necessary when working in this style is the bulging rule; IIRC H&amp;FJ have a few of those.</p>
<p>Various Didone glyphs have been used decoratively, such as the asterisk.</p>
<p>I included a few dingbats (not really ornaments) in Scotch Modern.

<p>There seems a lot of attention in getting them to mirror a Didone ascetic of unornamented structure and a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; appearance, I would have thought ornaments useful in typographic design of today when you see attributes of fonts like flourishes becoming (perhaps too) popular within typography also.</p>

<p>After looking at the Linotype Didot Ornaments at fonts.com, I&rsquo;m wondering why they were developed, too. They are absolutely wretched&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think Adrian Fruitger was influenced by La Henriade when he &lsquo;revised&rsquo; Didot to a family of 12 weights including the ornaments in 1991, so recent editions they are.
I&rsquo;ve heard typographers call them elegant, classic and even powerful but never wretched!
Just out of interest as I enjoy hearing constructive criticism, why do you feel that way?</p>

<p>It would appears that whoever designed the Didot Ornaments shown above took &ldquo;Modern&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;Art Moderne,&rdquo; a.k.a. Art Deco,a style which they attempt&ndash;at least to my eye, rather poorly&ndash;to emulate.
On the other hand, the Bodoni ornaments below which appear in the book I referenced are in keeping with their actual historical period, and are&ndash;again, to my eye&ndash;rather elegant.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As something of an historical purist, I would have to agree with Nick.</p>
<p>However, as this is design, the purpose of which is to resolve contradictions, there may be a way to make good the ornaments with their typeface. The harder the challenge, the more potential. Are you up for it, Hugo?</p>

I&rsquo;ll need to work with them for a while before I&rsquo;ll feel comfortable presenting further and I have some time (until the new year) to guideline usage of these cuts within their corporate visual guides. I&rsquo;m still not sure if they will end up in there or not, I need to look at application carefully, in the wrong hands it could end up a disaster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rather excited about the reference of &lsquo;Art Moderne&rsquo; by Nick though, I hadn&rsquo;t thought to research in that era or art style. I sense it&rsquo;s not an area of passion for you both but again, could you recommend further reading in this area?</p>
<p>I have also taken advice and purchased myself a copy of Giambattista Bodoni - Manuale Tipografico (well it is my birthday today and amazon twists the arm so well). It&rsquo;s one of only a handful of serious historical reference books I&rsquo;ve bought since my college days and almost since I owned my first computer, which I&rsquo;m sure is more to-do the reason. So I look forward to receiving it, it&rsquo;s a good read at over 1200 pages too.</p>
