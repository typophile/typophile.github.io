body: Hi, <BR>I don&#39;t like the percolator consonants much.. but I would like to
  use the vowels for my OASE Logo. Could someone help me find a font that is equally
  wide, serif-style, that I could combine with my percolator bits? Any suggestions?  <BR>Thanks
  in advance, Miriam  <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/52316.jpg"

  body: Thanks, But I was looking for something less &#34;catchy&#34;, a more classical,
    well balanced style that could be used for the word &#34;wellness&#34; as well.
    IT seems to me like democratica and percolator are based on the same classic font
    and that base font I am trying to find.

    seems more condensed to me.

  body: Well, as much as I don&#39;t think Rotis &#40;et al&#41; such a good idea
    ... it might be exactly what you need for this project. Just playing with it I&#39;ve
    found all iterations--serif, semi-serif, sans, semi-sans--might really work. The
    serif structure, or lack of it maybe, in your logo doesn&#39;t work with a didone,
    transitional or mechanic style serif.

  body: I have to agree, Rotis is a better match, no doubt, thanks for the tip, and
    I didn&#39;t mind the more condensed look either. Thanks a million!
