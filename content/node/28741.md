  each letter of the alphabet, set in a typeface that begins with that letter. Nothing
  new or mind-blowing I know, however I am having some trouble with some of the more
  unusual letters and thought I would query the typo-hive mind to see if anyone can
  perhaps help in my research. I have pretty much every letter covered except Y. Is
  it just me, or are there no good typefaces that start with this letter? Help!\r\n\r\n"
