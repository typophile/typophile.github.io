  piece. It's dialogue-based, with character names in front of each line. What's a
  good way to typeset this?\r\n<!--break-->\r\n(I was thinking about doing a faux
  movie script type of thing with the monospaced typeface, but it goes against the
  rest of the magazine and it's borderline pass\xE9).\r\n\r\nCan you point me towards
  some successful examples of dialogue typography?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDan"

  body: The <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>'s only real concern is that the character
    names be obviously different from the dialogue, which can be done with boldface
    or italics (preferred). Character's names may be abbreviated, and their speeches
    should be indented left.

  body: "Small caps for character names. Italics are for stage directions.\r\n\r\nTake
    a look at the Yale drama series for an interesting design. The speakers names
    are on a line by themselves, and the only place where there is space above. All
    stage directions are set in italic (conventional) and begin a new line. If you're
    reading a play as an actor -- or working sound or lights -- this is very helpful.
    All the spoken words are together, all the instructions are in italic and on a
    line(s) by themselves. As below, except I can't set small caps here.\r\n\r\nFRED:\r\nBlah
    blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
    blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah \r\n<cite>smiles</cite>\r\nblah blah
    blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.\r\n<cite>exits stage right, as ESMERELDA
    and her entourage enter stage left, trailing daffodils, and chanting an odd mixture
    of an Irish and Hawai'ian tune.</cite>\r\n\r\nERNIE:\r\nBlah, blah, blah.\r\n\r\nThis
    style (design) is a little harder to read at first if you are sitting in an armchair,
    but if you've ever worked in the theater, it is a delight. "

  body: "One small amendment to Charles; very short directions are some times set
    in italics within the dialogue, enclosed in parenthesis; e.g.:\r\n\r\nJOHN:\r\nHello!
    <em>(calling offstage)</em> Hello?"

  body: "Dan, here is a quick screenshot from a book I typeset some months ago, featuring
    three plays. As Charles pointed out, small caps are usually used for character
    names, and I've also used italics are for stage directions. Another crucial element
    is the negative paragraph indent after the first line, which helps the reader
    keeping track of who's talking. Also, after the character name I put a double
    space before teh dialogue starts (sometimes, in other books I've seen, it is more
    spaced). Hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/play_6233.jpg]"

  body: "Just a note -- running in small directions, such as \"smiles,\" is conventional,
    whereas breaking even one word to a new line, a la the Yale style, is not. In
    fact, if a \"direction\" occurs in the middle of a speech, the whole thing is
    often run in.\r\n\r\nMany authors, and editors, prefer the run in style, esp.
    when the dialogue is short. My response is they're more comfortable in the armchair
    than in the working part of a theater.\r\n\r\nThe flush & hang too is more conventional
    -- you're using extra space along the left margin to signal a new speaker, rather
    than interlinear space. Either works to help you find your place. The more stage
    directions there are, the better flush & hang. Same if each speech is short.\r\n\r\nAs
    a general observation, the younger the playwright, the better off you are to stay
    \"conventional.\" Editors can get rule-bound at any age . . ."
