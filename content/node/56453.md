body: This is supposed to be  a document that all members of a network of organizations
  will sign during a big come together week whet they will agree to the new guidelines
  etc. I am thinking Blackletter but not sure what combination to use. I want it to
  look good and have that old fashion feeling but readable. Any thoughts?

  body: Maybe some rotunda? The closest choice to a roman, so it is not very strange
    to modern eyes. I would  recommend San Marco or Cresci Rotunda.
