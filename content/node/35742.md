    it? If you are making money, why ask? ;)

    \"About\" pages, but that's just me. :-) \r\n\r\nNice work.\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "Thanks guys. Eyehawk, in reference to your statement about it possibly appearing
    passe. My only response is that far too often I come across design and illustration
    sites that are difficult to navigate, graphically/aesthetically distracting, etc.
    I figured I would go in the complete opposite direction, strip it down as much
    as possible so that my work is all that is influencing the viewer, and that the
    user experience isn't aggravating or annoying. That said, I too feel its a tad
    on the boring side, and I've got about 12 other comps with some fancy elements.
    I may end up having to implement one of those if too many people are concentrating
    on the boring/plain-ness of the site and not my work.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for
    the feedback!"

  body: I'm sorry but I don't like the drop-down navigation, it takes too much work.
    I think those items should be active links on the left side of the page. It's
    also confusing to have WORK and INFO in the drop down navigations when they don't
    take you anywhere. I don't think you need "About" either. From a design standpoint
    it is pretty basic but it works.

  body: "Hey, Shane, I like a clean, basic website like yours, but I agree with Patty
    about the drop-down navigation. It's a bit confusing that the headers WORK and
    INFO look like separate menu items and then they don't bring anything up. If you
    keep the drop-down menu, maybe you could integrate the section names into the
    lists -- by removing the dotted lines beneath INFO and WORK, for instance.\r\n\r\nAlso...
    I'm not sure it's a good idea to have a practically empty page as the starting
    point... Think of that page as a cover for a book or printed portfolio of your
    work... You could use that space to say or show something about yourself -- it's
    the first impression you are making to a stranger visiting your site for the first
    time! Do you really want him or her to be greeted with a white page that says
    \"NAVIGATE!\"?"

  body: "HI everyone, thank you for the feedback! I actually have another version
    of the site with a list-menu instead of a dropdown like you all suggested, and
    its been suggested ina  few other places so I will be integrating that asap.\r\n\r\n\"Do
    you really want him or her to be greeted with a white page that says \u201CNAVIGATE!\u201D?\"\r\n\r\nActually,
    that would totally fit my personality, haha! But i see your point, I'll work on
    soemthing for the opening page.\r\n\r\nThanks again everyone!"
