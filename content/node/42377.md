  (Bitstream version, which has no editable embedding restrictions), but upon TTF
  generation, I can no longer embed the font in a PDF.  \r\n\r\nTwo questions: 1)
  where are the embedding/editable embedding flags set in FontForge, and 2) how can
  I find out if this is against Bitstream's EULA?  I'm not selling or distributing
  the font, it's merely to be able to use a specific bullet in the same form field
  as Futura Book."

    the settings under Element > Font Info > OS/2.  Works great.
