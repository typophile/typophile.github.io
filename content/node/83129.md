  body: "Thanks, that was my first port of call, however I didn't feel that any of
    the fonts matched, especially the height and the positioning of serifs such as
    on the R.\r\n\r\nIs this a proprietary version of a generic style?"

  body: I think the outlines are added, even in the original image - the 4 is outlined

    R, A, S\u2026\r\nSorry to be pedantic \u2013 it's for a direct parody so the details
    are quite important, not just the overall impression.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
