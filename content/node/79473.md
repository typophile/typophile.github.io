  body: "dear wiganwebs,\r\n\r\nthank you for your comment. actually, it is as often
    seen spelled \"photoengraving\".\r\n\r\naccording to one of the inventors of the
    photo-engraving system for print (and, especially) stationery:\r\n\r\n\"TECHNICAL
    ASSOCIATION OF THE GRAPHIC ARTS . Thirteenth Annual Meeting, June 12-14, 1961\r\nPOWDERLESS
    ETCHING OF COPPER\r\nPAUL F. BORTH\r\nMARVIN C. ROGERS\r\nPhoto-Engravers Research,
    Inc., Park Forest, Illinois\"\r\n\r\nin this highly important trade publication
    about the PERI-etch system of intaglio etching for commercial printing (on paper),
    borth spells the subject \"photo-engraving\" in the title then \"photoengraving\"
    in the body of the article.\r\n\r\ni would trust that borth knows how to spell
    the method he pioneered, and of which he published papers in the double digits.\r\n\r\nthis
    being written, thank you for the observation. in the engraving blog, i have added
    all three spellings.\r\n\r\nplease note: the link you provided was for etching
    on product surfaces. a like process but not the highly specialized form of etching
    developed expressly for print (and, in especially, stationery engraving, which
    is the subject of the engraving blog.)\r\n"
