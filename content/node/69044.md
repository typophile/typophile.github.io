body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm doing a project for the university wich consists in making
  a book about \"Adrian Frutiger\" and how he focusses on type legibility over any
  thing. So, I explain in it how he looked at the typography, how It must be done
  and why some ones are more readables than other ones (as for example, why Avenir
  is better for reading than Futura, as its like a re-design of it).\r\n\r\nSo, the
  problem is that I'm getting stucked getting HQ photos of Frutiger types to put in
  the book, as Internet has not a lot of images from he / his types. Also I need them
  in HQ cause I'm making a 20x20 book, so the resolution have to be bigger and also
  have a good ppp, not 72 from screen wich is not enough...\r\n\r\nI'm taking some
  captures from his DVD \"Adrian Frutiger, the man of black & white\" but I want to
  have some photos of his types applied to things (brands, signals, posters, whatever).\r\n\r\nI
  would be glad if you help me with the research to found good Frutiger images.\r\n\r\nExcuse
  me if this posts don't goes here, I didn't know where to put it.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advice!"

    of Univers, Frutiger, etc. to make your own images.

    use stills from the movie perhaps he can suggest a source? Alternately you could
    try contacting Linotype. '

  body: "I'll give a try with Linotype, it's not easy to find samples of its type,
    because Linotype don't focuss over one single designer or type studio.\r\n\r\nI
    would like to take samples as for example, what you can found on Hoefler & Fere-Jones
    website, where tey put some photos of the making-off and that kind of stuff...
    in Linotype website you can get as much a normal PDF about some types, but not
    much else...\r\n\r\nI'll try also to contact Christoph as you said sii\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the answers guys!"

    the Frutiger monograph (\xAB<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/birkhauser/architecture+&+design/book/978-3-7643-8581-1\">Adrian
    Frutiger: Typefaces. The Complete Works</a>\xBB, I'm sure you can get it from/via
    your library) is an amazingly rich book. I'd say you *need* to look through that
    if you do a project about Frutiger."

  body: "altaira, I'm looking in Frutiger books, of course, all his related experience
    is written through different books, and also I own some of them. That's where
    I'm getting the information about how he used to work, his types, and as much
    as I can to research...\r\n\r\nBut as you may understand, I'm an student, so I've
    got not much economy, so I ussually can't buy as much books as I can, believe
    me, I would like to have them all... but it's so expensive for me.\r\n\r\nI'm
    trying to search also in libraries, where I've got some of his books, but there
    are some that I couldn't find... and I'm not able to spend more than 300\u20AC
    (just for saying a number) on an university project, not a client one...\r\n\r\nSo
    that's what I'm asking for some know resources, thanks anyway for the advice,
    but obviously I'm already looking at Frutiger books ^^"
