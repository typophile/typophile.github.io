    really love when logos have a strong, clear symbol instead of all those text and
    type based logos around. An art director once told me one simple rule; make sure
    your logo fits into a small square at the right top of a page. This one definitely
    applies to that!

    thank you all for your help and input :)"

    amazing logos, it\u2019s always be nice to see a well constructed website that
    considers light sources. Creating logo is very important for every company identity,
    you proving very good information about it in this post."
