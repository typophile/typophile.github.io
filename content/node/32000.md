  body: "To be more specific\u2026\r\n\r\nFor example: I want the word \u2018shit\u2019
    to be replaced by \u2018excrement\u2019.\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature ss02 {\r\nlookup ss02.pri1
    {\r\nsub [shit] by [excrement];\r\n} ss02.pri1;\r\n} ss02;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    is obvious not the way to go \u2013 since Fonlab want me to create two new glyphs
    \u2018shit\u2019 and \u2018excrement\u2019. Is there a simple way to make this
    work?\r\n\r\nHelp me please!\r\nKTKM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBtw. It didn\u2019t occur
    to me (until now) that Typophile is performing censorship! Anglo-saxon-american
    bullshit! Pathetic!\r\n"
