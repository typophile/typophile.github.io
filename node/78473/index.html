Till now I have this, with Franklin Gothic and Eurofont: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_3618.jpg] 
Any thoughts?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The body faces you have chosen are very middling, in terms of weight, proportion, and style (although the Eurostile does have a bit of personality).
Therefore, they are not sufficiently extreme to counterpoint the heading, which is highly condensed, finely detailed, high contrast, and mannered.
Overall, the effect is one-sided, not balanced.
I recommend Beaufort Extended (my own faces always come to mind, for some reason :-)
It holds its own against the extremism of Anaconda, by being extended in proportion (contrary), finely detailed in serif finish (similar), low contrast (contrary), and somewhat mannered (similar). 
<a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/extended/">http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/extended/</a></p>
<p>I also think one has to have a reason for using a condensed face. Often the layout calls for it.
If that is not the case, then a pairing with an extended face seems reasonable.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you both. Yes, there is a reason for using a condensed font. The layout and the fonts need to feel&hellip;well, quaint. And I like the rigor and structure that Anaconda has, as to me it seems to suggest exactly that: old style without being antiquated, strong, encased in a well fitting suit. I don&rsquo;t think a sans font would cut it for headlines in this case - or at least I haven&rsquo;t seen yet a sans serif that is as rigorous and structured and befits that atmosphere that I&rsquo;m trying to create.
Nick Shinn, that&rsquo;s a wonderful font.I did some tests with the generated samples from myfonts and I think the regular width would look better though. The extended feels a bit overwhelming for some reason - though perhaps that&rsquo;s because the paragraphs won&rsquo;t be very wide, 500 px maximum(yes, this is for the web). But I might be wrong since my background is in front-end dev and not in typography.

Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time and patience.</p>

<p>Be sure to check Beaufort&rsquo;s rendering in Windows both with Standard (Greyscale) rendering and Cleartype rendering.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Franklin Gothic is that bad here, so I&rsquo;ll suggest a couple of others in the same vein: 
FF Bau from FontFont shares the static skeleton (structure) with Anaconda, and is available for @font-face embedding in a properly hinted Web version. The same goes for Benton Sans from Font Bureau.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you. FF Bau is a bit too strong, in my opinion. I want the text to be readable, but I still want the headers to catch one&rsquo;s attention. I am afraid that with too many strong elements the user won&rsquo;t be able to focus on anything. However you gave me the idea(well, indirectly) to search for a pair at the same font house and I found Flanders. I keep looking at it and I think I might have a winner here, though I wish it was just a tad more extended.

Perhaps someone knows of a similar font in an extended version?</div>
