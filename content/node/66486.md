  Devanagri, Kannada script ...\r\n\r\nI want to spend some time learning about the
  history and forms of glyphs from different (and related by origin) scripts and common
  features among them.\r\nSpecifically, I am looking for a word, if there is one,
  for this kind of study to better locate related books/papers/courses etc.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  any suggestions on where/what to start with would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: i think it's Palaeography for ancient stuff, that's a good place to start
    and you can get more specific from there; handwriting, inscription or modern language
    (since dictionaries and the like) all have different and equally obscure names.

    Symbol and Script" by Hans Jensen as well.

    the works already cited, Nakanishi's\r\n\"Writing systems of the world\" is pretty
    good.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatology\">Grammatology</a>.\r\n\r\nThese
    are some general books on writing systems that I've found useful over the years:\r\n\r\nCoulmas,
    Florian. <em>The Blackwell encyclopedia of writing systems.</em>\r\n\r\nCoulmas,
    Florian. <em>The writing systems of the world.</em>\r\n\r\nCoulmas, Florian. <em>Writing
    systems: an introduction to their linguistic analysis.</em>\r\n\r\nDaniels, Peter
    T. & Bright, William. <em>The world's writing systems.</em>\r\n\r\nDirringer,
    David. <em>The alphabet.</em>\r\n\r\nJensen, Hans. <em>Sign, symbol and script.</em>\r\n\r\nSampson,
    Geoffrey. <em>Writing systems.</em>\r\n\r\nTaylor, Isaac. <em>The alphabet.</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nOf
    course, one can locate lots of other books on individual writing systems. This
    is a good resource for finding additional material:\r\n\r\nEhlich, Konrad & Coulmas,
    Florian & Graefen, Gabriele. <em>A bibliography on writing and written language.</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nOne
    thing to note -- as Gerrit Noordzij pointed out regarding the work of Ignace Gelb,
    who coined the term grammatology -- is that all these books are concerned with
    the system aspect of writing systems, and not with the writing part."

    think it makes sense to use this term, which has been around for several decades
    and is used by people like Florian Coulmas who have contributed massively to the
    study of writing systems, rather than inventing new terms."
