  body: "A GSUB table is a substitution lookup. The most common one is for ligatures:\r\n\r\nfeature
    liga {\r\n sub f i by fi;\r\n sub f l by fl;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nAnd that's the
    most basic version of it. \r\n\r\nOT fonts only seem to work properly if they
    have at least one GSUB and one GPOS. (Kern is the \"big\" GPOS. GSUB is how small
    caps, alternate numeral sets, etc. are achived.)\r\n\r\n"
