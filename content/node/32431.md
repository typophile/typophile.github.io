    translated into Russian? My old copy is just German, French, and English.</em></li></ul>So
    is mine, actually (3rd edition, New York: Visual Communication Books, Hastings
    House, Publishers, Inc., 1977). My translation of <em>Typographie</em>/<em>Typography</em>
    was published by Kniga (Moscow) in 1982. It was just Russian (no German, English,
    or French), so I had to adapt the text layout accordingly.'

    honor!\r\nYou meant then that you had much more space since there was only one
    language instead of three.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    body: "An honour it was. I first read the book in 1967 as it came out. After almost
      fifteen years I decided to translate it (from original German, of course). A
      contract with Arthur Niggli was signed by Kniga, so we used the original films
      received from Z\xFCrich. Phototypesetting in Univers 55 was done by Pravda on
      Linotron 202.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, there was plenty of space, so, based on the same
      grid, I used either single-, or double-, or triple-column page layout."
