body: I restore vintage Alfa Romeos and am occasionally called upon to recreate labels,
  decals, and data plates from these Italian cars.  I can't seem to find a font that
  duplicaes the 1's, 4's, and 7's that are sililar to what I find on these cars and
  in their period literature.  I do have examples of the numbers as stamped into the
  sheet metal and data plates for reference.  Can anyone help?
