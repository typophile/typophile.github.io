<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all. This is a message mostly directed to 'Haag' but also to anyone else who might help. About a month ago I purchased 'Foco' for a corporate job but unfortunately it was never used.
Now I'm doing a book on New Zealand Maori facial tatoos, called Moko's. The book explores both traditional and modern interpretations of Moko design. It's both an academic text as well as a book of beautiful modern portraits (like the one attached).
Foco is perfect as an alternate text font, for the purposes of this job it complements the subject but also works well paired with Plantin. Unfortunately it has no Italic forms (or none that I can find anywhere online). I desperately want to use this font but need an Italic for us to proceed as the book 272 pages.
Can anyone help? Unfortunately this is an urgent request as we are presenting a blad in the next week.
If there isn't an italic version then can someone suggest an appropriate alternative that posesses the same character and tone.
Regards

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for your help. They look like great alternatives. I bought Omnes for another job so I'm a little apprehensive about using it again so soon though it is a fantastic font.
Any idea if there is in fact an Italic version of Foco? I read some old forum posts (2004) where 'Haag' was getting feedback on the early iterations of what would be FH Foco. There was a post regarding a proposed Italic but the trail dries up there.
Any exta help would be great.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi everyody!!
Things have been so busy that I couldn't catch up with this forum.
Thanks a lot Tiffany for contacting me in private.
I already changed my account settings to allow other users to contact me (it was a shame the way it was ;)
I already answered Bevan in private, but considering all you guys in this threat, I'll clarify:
Foco doesn't have italics, yet. It was released in partnership with DaltonMaag and designing them is one of our goals... but I'm sorry to say that it won't happen soon.
"see ya" all around ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Interesting project, Bevan. Can you please tell us how, exactly, Plantin & Foco work together to compliment the deep spiritual nature of Moko? I am sure you have a good understanding of typography (seven is a top design firm) and your reasoning is sound—but it is nice to hear it from the horses mouth, as it were!

<div class=commentbody>Hi Kris. Plantin & Foco have a very similar line colour which was the primary reason for the pairing. As this is primarily an academic text (although by nature of the subject it will no doubt become a coffee table book), I need to pair two fonts that would occupy the same negative space so the change in type face doesn't interupt the reader.
Plantin is favourite of mine, it was a selfish choice.
Foco possess some very nice subtlities in the tails and feet. To me, and that is not to say this is fact, it seemed sympathetic to Maori line. It's a bit of a stretch but it just seem to work.
To be fair post-rationalising is for clients. There's something to be said when things 'just work' together. So I apologise if you were after a deeper meaning.
B.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the reply. I thought you would say as much.
"To be fair post-rationalising is for clients"
Do your clients know about this? Whatever happened to pre-rationalising the design?
