  body: It has some characteristics of Pump, but honestly -- I'll bet you won't find
    the exact typeface. Like very many outdoor signs of the Streamline Deco period
    (US 1930-1940), this looks like it could be a "one-off." It's very possible the
    sign maker modified an existing font specifically for this AERO sign.

    for this AERO sign.</em>\r\n\r\nIf it was made in the '30s or '40s (and it looks
    like it was), it's highly unlikely that the sign-maker would have worked from
    \"an existing font.\" Sign-making was separate tradition from fonts and typefounding,
    although there were influence in both directions. It's only been since the advent
    of digital fonts and vinyl cutting machines that the two worlds have merged (to
    the detriment of the sign-making art, in my opinion)."

  body: Well, obviously I wasn't talking about digital manipulation in the 30s and
    40s. When I said "modified and existing font," I meant, used a known font as a
    basis for new letterforms, which was (and is) common practice for sign makers.
