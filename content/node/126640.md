  possible font identifier on the web and answered a multitude of questions regarding
  fonts, spent hours on google fonts to find anything just close to it... and I am
  at my wits end. PLEASE, if somebody could help me, that would be great. Thanks in
  advance.

  body: Oh My word!! these are perfect! Thank you so much! How did you find this,
    please.. I am regularly on the search for fonts for existing logos, of which the
    owner has lost the font or doesn't know what they used. What do I look for, how
    do I look for...?? I normally use whatfontis or other similar sites and more or
    less find something close, but I spend hours and sometimes don't find it. Like
    on this one, i have spent so many hours, gave up and spent many more hours and
    you gave me a solution within a day.
