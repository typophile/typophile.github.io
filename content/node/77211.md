  I have the .mbn files and want to convert them to truetype or opentype. I'm trying
  using transtype or fontlab studio but some glyphs are falling back to other fonts.
  What can I do?"

  body: Oh, sorry. I read 'transtype' and skipped 'fontlab'. So, you are using it
    already. If you are correctly generating the fonts there should not be a problem.
    Can you give more info on how you are generating the OT fonts? I don't fully understand
    your sentence ' some glyphs are falling back to other fonts'...

  body: I import the mac font in fontlab and then I go Glyph->Glyph Names->Reencode
    Glyphs and choose MacOS Greek Encoding and export the font in opentype or truetype.
    But some greek letters when i type them they are not being written with this font
    but with some other like courrier new(depends on the font fall back rules in the
    software like quark that I use)

  body: "Have you checked the encoding in the resulting font? It would be worth checking
    whether the problem letters in the generated font have the correct Unicode values.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thought: are the problem letters by any chance the ones that have the double-mapping
    problem: Delta, mu, Omega? See Paul Hunt's post in the following thread:\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/37077]]"
