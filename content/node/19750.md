body: "Hey all,\r\nI am doing a complete overhaul of my company's Identity. We are
  a web firm that emphasizes standards in our design and builds. Anyway, I love DIN,
  I hate its @ symbol though and I am also starting to see it in too many places.
  \r\n\r\nSo I have started looking around and have come across a few typefaces that
  I like that maintain some of the things that I like about DIN...\r\n\r\nGreg Lindy's
  Section (http://www.vllg.com/Lux/Section/mudTyper+Weights)\r\nChester's Apex New
  (http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/)\r\nM\xE1rio Feliciano's
  Flama (http://www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights)\r\n\r\nI have been
  around the San-Serif block and am tiring of the same ol' same ol'. I want something
  fresh that isn't plastered on every billboard around town. That said, rule out Trade
  G, Franklin Gothic, Univers, Conduit, Bailey Sans, Helvetica, Helvetica Neue, News
  Gothic, Bank Gothic, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, the type has to be refined enough to use
  as body copy. I am gonna use it everywhere. So before I choose what typeface to
  get in bed with I thought I would see what other typefaces you guys might think
  I like, based on what I have said.\r\n"

  body: Not sure if Freight has any DIN qualities. I assume Dan is looking for a sans
    with straight sides and a more geometric structure.
