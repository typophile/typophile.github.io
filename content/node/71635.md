body: "Hey again,\r\n\r\nI am creating my personal 2010 Graphic design portfolio and
  I just finished my first page , wich will be quite important , as the style will
  be repeated partially in the whole book.\r\n\r\nHere's the first two tries:\r\n\r\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/i/portfolioone.png/\r\n\r\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/i/portfoliotwo.png/\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see I just inserted the \"portfolio 2010\" text , as I want to nail this
  important element in the page before proceeding with the other elements.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think of it in general ? Is it legible? Are the colors ok?\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

  body: "I quite like it and I definitely prefer the 1st one with out the 'depth effect'.\r\nI
    would maybe consider shortening the arm of the 'r'.\r\n\r\nWhen you say book,
    I take it that this will be printed? About the colors, it is hard to judge without
    seeing the type of work that you'll be showing.\r\n\r\nKeep us posted."

  body: "Using several colours against a grey background will produce some problems
    as some of the colours will approach the background tonally, just as yellow might
    against a white background (the more variety in colours the more chance of this
    happening). I think you have done quite well, though perhaps the grey <em>is</em>
    just a fraction too dark. Some colours project themselves more than others and
    this is also an important thing to remember.\r\n\r\nFor something similar in typography
    you might enjoy Theo Van Doesburg and Wim Crouwel.\r\nFor some more ideas about
    colours and how they project forward and or sit back, maybe <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9b/Hans_Hofmann%27s_painting_%27The_Gate%27%2C_1959\u201360.jpg\">Hans

  body: "I agree with 1985. The issue is that some of the colors you are using are
    approaching the same value as the dark gray...specifically the purple, so visually
    the purple sections are disappearing. \r\n\r\nMultiple colors are OK but make
    sure there is a strong value contrast between the colors you are using in the
    type vs. the background color. "

  body: "As others have said, the gray is <em>way</em> too dark.\r\n\r\nI would prefer
    to see some pieces from your actual portfolio before we begin judging how the
    portfolio should be designed... that way we can get a general idea of the type
    of work you do."

  body: '... and with the purple disappearing and the f descending (since when do
    f''s have descenders?), I first read "Portpolio." Otherwise, with a bit of work,
    potentially cool stuff though.'
