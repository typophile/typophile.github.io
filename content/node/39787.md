  in all the drawings. 'Cause when you think about it you always look a person straight
  in the eyes to check them out, right? Even shy people hiding in the back of the
  bus ;) \r\n\r\nAnd in animated movies, it's always so hard to capture the soul through
  the eyes, but when drawing with the face as a central element, you might have a
  better chance\u2026? \r\n\r\n                             http://issuu.com/a.mar.illo/docs/a_la_muerte_con_una_sonrisa/5
