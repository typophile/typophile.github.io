<div class=commentbody>Trying to give this a type angle:
Could somebody offer a synopsis of the macro capabilities of digital cameras? My RDC-7 can do macro at ONE cm, and at its full resolution* that translates to over 2000dpi**. But it's a 3-4 year old model now, so I'm wondering if that type of capability has become pretty standard, or do you have to pay a premium for that, or what.
* It's funky "Pro" mode, which however requires a tripod.
** Although you only get good focus right in the middle.

<div class=commentbody>I use my digicam most, but whenever I'm doing 'real' photography (as opposed to registrering things I'd otherwise forget) I miss my old, trusty SLR.
The thing with digital is, that it doesn't have that same feel, I find them slow and cumbersome to 'navigate' menus. The fact that I have to navigate at all annoys me.
That said, I like all sorts of photography and every technique has it's good sides. Lomography (I hate the term, but the it kind of gets to you) , digital, SLRs....

<div class=commentbody>well yes you are talking about a non pro camera. It's a consumer camera. So the problem with the macro is the lens quality.
my <a href="http://www.calumetphoto.com/ctl?PAGE=Controller&ti=cat.ItemCopy&ACTIVETAB=COPY_LONG&ac.ui.pn=cat.ItemDetail2&ac.item.itemNo=355-355C" target=_blank>Nikon 28-135mm lens</a> for an SLR digita has a switch for macro/nomal. It lets you focus lower than 1.5 meters in macro. My Sunpack ring flash has a manual flash range of 20-100cm or 8'' - 40''. A ring flash of this kind is for dental or nature photos.
1cm is a bit odd so it must be some distortion of the lens. If your images on the outside are as far away as the centre then it's a lens distortion. Macro is to fix close focus and lenses like my <a href="http://www.calumetphoto.com/ctl?PAGE=Controller&ac.ui.pn=cat.CatItemDetail&ac.item.itemNo=355-348H&ac.cat.CatTree.detail=y&type=PRDINDEX" target=_blank>Nikon 70-200 anti-vib auto lens</a> that sells for more than two of you cameras does not have a macro setting.
there is a website something like www.macrophotography.org that might help.

<div class=commentbody>> So the problem with the macro is the lens quality.
I thought maybe that was something inherent to macro photography (I mean when taking a really close picture of something flat). BTW, mine does have a macro/normal selection; when you hit it, it feels like the entire lens assembly is moving to one end (which it can do because of its funky-cool physical format). I don't know what you mean by distortion, but the results right in the middle of the frame are pretty good... perfect for looking at single glyphs! :-)
So let me ask you: if you were to take a maximum-"dpi" image of a line of small text, with your best equipment, could you get the entire line in focus?

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I switched from analog photography to digital almost all the way. My old EOS and my Mamiya and Rollei are gathering dust these days, not too much of a shame about the Eos, but the other too.. oh well.
I work with a 20D at the moment and have so far almost everytime upgraded whenever the next semi-pro-EOS digital cam came out, as there always were significant improvements. I'd love to have the 1D, but it is just to expensive to upgrade every two years, I feel... and as I'm not a pro-phtographer, I just don't need it all that much. And hey, most of all, of course, I'd love to have a H1D by Hasselblad :-D.
My workflow is that I shoot either directly with the Eos (using the Canon L-lenses) or tethered with BreezeSys' DSLR Remote Pro, which makes studio photography much more easy.
I don't use photoshop to convert RAW (or even the awful original Canon Tools) but the superb CaptureOne, the only real tool for doing a bit of darkroom work on the files, and fast as lightning.
The final editing of the 16bit Tiff happens, of course, in the shop, mostly with the aid of AutoEye and nik ProPhoto, but some other filters as well.
I think that digital photography saves you a lot of time in situ, but on the other hand you have to invest more time in the digital darkroom to get the results you want. This, however, to me personally was a liberating step. I never liked hovering round the photo lab and paying loads of money until I finally got the results on paper. It's much more natural for me, being a kid of the computer-design-age, to do what I did to «normal» photos anyway, that is work them over digitally. Only now, my basic ingredients are much better, as there isn't any scanner involved anymore. I almost always workon images I get, even if they are from external pro photographers, and I also do so on my own photos.
In many ways this has been as liberating as doing music on the computer. I can't hardly play a song on a real piano, but with constructing music on a PC, stacking sequences and elements... which is rather like designing music, I think... I actually do have a lot of fun (whenever I get around to it, which is almost NEVER these last two years :-().
Oh, and for «on the road» I found myself getting a 5 MP Sony T3. Nice, small package, very well designed, fast reaction, but alas it is so small that most images are somewhat blurry... and the camera needs a flash too often, I think.

Most other digital Cams can do 1 cm macro these days. If you need higher resolution, there are a couple of other options, if 2 MP works fine for you, the RDC is still a very good choice.
The pro-Mode, however, was sucky as hell :-D

Shot in natural sun light, hand held, Nikon D2H ASA 200, lens 28..105mm @105mm macro setting. F 29.0 shutter:1/320sec
Distance about 5cm from the end of the lens. (seems to be as close as you can put the front of the lens at this 105mm lens setting.)

It's basically a Nikon body with a Fuji sensor.

<div class=commentbody>We're working with a photographer using the S3 on a catalogue job. And with that model (and the S2 before that), we have a rather massive amount of red and green noise, especially when they're doing long exposures. It's gotten noticeable better with the S3, but it's still there, especially when they work for hours, under massive artificial hot lights... I reckon it has to do with the Chip heating up.
Do you know that problem or is it just specific to these circumstances they're shooting under?

<div class=commentbody>The H1D is what I'm pushing the client for, but it is definitively quite expensive and as the printed project looks about 100% better than the catalogues of other companies, I don't have too much reason to nag. Will happen someday, when Sinar and Hassel go down with their prices to something the photograph can afford, I'm sure he'll do it then, he'd like to as he also has come to understand that semi-pro SLRs are not the best solution for shooting 14 days almost nonstop with long exposure under massive artificial light :-D...but I can understand only too well that the Hasselblads just are fricking expensive...

<div class=commentbody>Yes they are: and so are the backs of medium cameras. ProOne or Leaf are expensive.
I have a Mamiya RZ67 Pro II, but I don't know if the digital backs work for that. It's a great fashion camera and popular. But the new one Mamiya RZ67-D is the one what is most compatible.
I guess in a few years the SLRs will be 22mpix so medium formats won't matter any more.

<div class=commentbody>I'm not totally convinced of the Fuji S3.
It's effective pixels are 6.17 and it's interpolated to 12.1 mega pixel.
It only shoots are 2 frames per second which is slow for sport or news. The Nikon D2-H is 8 frames a second and the Nikon D2-H is only £500 more and worth the extra dosh.
