    white subhead in the second picture is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/beton_extra_bold_ot_std/?&sample_text=QUENTIN%20TARANTINO\">Beton</a>.\r\n\u20182009'

  body: "I found it on dafont in the Stencil/Army section. I'm not sure of its legality
    (since it's so close to Ionia) so I won't mention its name though. You can find
    it easily enough.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
