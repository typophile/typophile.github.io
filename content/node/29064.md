  body: I assume it's embossed, so that helps. But Legato seems to lend itself well
    to embossing.

  body: "The type looks great, but would anybody else have been tempted to break the
    lines before \"of\", so that you don't have a series of single line grafs that
    just say \"Chicago\"?\r\n\r\nOr better yet, run the secondary type smaller, so
    that long names fit on a single line?"

  body: "Haha... Stephen is ribbing me because Legato is not my favorite [[Evert Bloemsma]]
    font... but this is very beautiful. In fact if someone forced me to use [[Gill
    Sans]] (*that overused and aging uberclassic) again I'd have to convince them
    to use Legato instead.\r\n\r\n* Yeah, Gill Sans is overused but it's italics are
    still in my top 5, maybe top 3, best examples of sans italics. =) Sorry, I didn't
    mean to stray the conversation from that nice embossed sample here..."

  body: "It's trying to be a text face, so the glyphs aren't supposed to be pretty
    (and I personally don't think they are). In my view if the glyphs are pretty there's
    something wrong.\r\n\r\nBeing a text face (as much as a sans could be), unless
    one accepts what Legato is trying to do, the only way somebody can mean something
    like \"I don't think the reversed contrast stuff works\" is to actually read text
    set in Legato. Otherwise it's probably the typical conservative reactionarism.
    The old \"It's different than what I've already decided I like, so it must be
    bad.\"\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    display or caption sizes. This sample is perfect for proving it has a timeless
    quality as well. '

  body: "I recently checked out the Manders book from UCLA. Yes, I could be imagining
    the following because I admittedly want it to be true, but Legato does seem to
    transcend the black and make a setting part of a whole with the paper (and not
    just on the cover where it's debossed). Looking at the various large-size settings
    throughout the book it's notable that I seem to feel a gentle resistance to my
    picking out of individual letters to analyze... This is good news for notan.\r\n\r\nSadly
    the only smaller-size settings in the book are in Balance for some reason, so
    any first-hand evaluation of Legato's real-world readability (as nearly hopeless
    as that would be, especially for somebody like me who's so concerned with it)
    will have to wait.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
