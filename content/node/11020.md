    rotate a text box or two a few  <BR>degrees and stay away from the fold. Sandpaper  <BR>could
    be good too. Oh, and don&#39;t forget to not clean  <BR>your scanner. <BR> <BR>This
    job could be done with just 5 text boxes. <BR> <BR>Is this for a particular magazine?

  body: Marc, do you think this kind of layout looks bad?  <BR>  <BR>I am not trying
    to copy someone&#39;s work, it just inspired me to try something very different
    to what I would usually do &#40;that is, very neat and minimal&#41;.  <BR>  <BR>Sean,
    I have a project at uni for double page spreads, this is the 1st time I&#39;m
    using grids &#40;eek!&#41;. I chose to redesign an article from Glamour mag about
    breaking up a friendship, but we don&#39;t have to adhere to the style of Glamour
    at all. That&#39;s why I considered doing something like the above example because
    I want it to have edge and attitude. It&#39;s advice about how to dump a bad friend!  <BR>  <BR>Thanks
    for replying I was about to ask if anyone was there!

  body: Marc,    <BR>    <BR>What do you mean <i>Just say no</i>? Do you     <BR>hate
    this?    <BR>    <BR>Cheryl,    <BR>    <BR>I would advise that if this your first
    time using    <BR>grids to choose a different style to emulate -    <BR>like one
    that actually uses grids. Try, even if    <BR>you think it is boring, a more traditional,
    structured     <BR>and formal layout. The pay back will be ten fold for     <BR>building
    upon a foundation of solid structure. After     <BR>you have studied strict layout
    you will find that you     <BR>will be able to create an ad like the one above
    with     <BR>more understanding of what it is you are doing.     <BR>Perhaps you
    can even insert visual jokes at that point.    <BR>    <BR>I am sure you have
    heard it before, but the rules have     <BR>to learned before they can be broken.  &#40;This
    is a     <BR>generalization really. Instinct is also very important.&#41;    <BR>    <BR>But
    again, challenge yourself a bit more and     <BR>perhaps even try a design style
    that you hate.    <BR>I think what you learn will be worth your suffering.    <BR>    <BR>This
    link  would be worth checking out.  <BR>http://www.imon.org/mueller-brockmann/
    <BR>  <BR>-sean michael    <BR>    <BR>Oh yea, whatever you choose to do, just
    use square    <BR>textboxes. Funky shaped ones will just be a whole    <BR>bunch
    of trouble with no real reason for having them.    <BR>

    so I saw way too much of  <BR>this stuff back in the heyday of David Carson  <BR>and
    Raygun.  <BR> <BR>Not that I have anything against asymmetry  <BR>per se. In fact,
    a &#34;neat and minimal&#34; spin on  <BR>this style could be pretty interesting.
    <BR> <BR>Oddly shaped text boxes are handy if you have  <BR>a specific shape in
    mind for a block of text.  <BR>That way you can change the size/leading of  <BR>the
    text without having to re-break lines or set  <BR>new tabs.

    that has a run  <BR>around applied to it. Just a diffrent way of  <BR>working

  body: I am going to try a more formal grid first before I try things as crazy as
    that. I did try to use a 3 column grid for a double page spread, but my tutors
    said it was too &#34;neat&#34; for the subject and it should look more emotional..I&#39;m
    working on it! <BR> <BR>I see that most of the people on this forum have years
    more experience than me, that is why I am finding your advice invaluable. <BR>
    <BR>The link was very useful and similar to the work I have been doing this year.
    <BR> <BR>Sean, since you are good at mags, maybe you could help me with Quark.
    I am designing 2 double page spreads where each page measures just under A3 size.
    But my printer only prints A4.. Do you know a way I can print two halves of my
    spread so that I can stick them together?

  body: 'Cheryl, is that example one of David Carson&#39;s? As a student at art school
    &#40;very recently!&#41;, I was quite excited and inspired by the work of David
    Carson. He managed to make typographic layouts into beautiful paintings. My views
    about typographic design might have changed since then, but I still appreciate
    his work from that period very much; it was a refreshing experiment that broke
    away from the minimal and grided layouts. He once said &#34;don&#39;t mistake
    legibility for communication&#34;. But I think legibility is a requirement for
    the basic function of typography: type is a carrier of textual information. Type
    ceases to be type as soon as that linguistic function is lost. David Carson&#39;s
    deconstructive typography was painting. It communicates at a different level from
    what we think of as traditional typography.   <BR>   <BR>Now, do layouts have
    to be &#39;deconstructive&#39; in order to be &#39;emotional&#39;? Not at all,
    I think. Emotion could be communicated in many different ways, through the use
    of space, sizes, colours, typefaces, weights.   <BR>   <BR>It&#39;s interesting
    to see that deconstructive type is not actually that easy to make on the computer!
    Modern computer software were made to be grid-friendly! And we are conditioned
    to design accordingly. It&#39;s interesting...    <BR>   <BR>Simply set to print
    with tiling in Quark on your A4 printer.'

  body: Hi all, <BR>I agree, very well put, Keith! :o&#41;  <BR>The example was from
    an online magazine called BEAST.  <a href="http://www.ths.nu/beast" target="_blank">http://www.ths.nu/beast</a>   <BR>I
    found it inspiring even though some of it looks quite crude at times..the content
    is random and bizarre, but interesting nonetheless. Tell us what you think of
    the site.  Although it seems this kind of typography; a la David Carson etc, is
    dead in some of your eyes? &#42;cries&#42; ! &#39;Cause some of my friends are
    still trying this stuff out.  <BR> <BR>Where do you think magazine design is heading
    in terms of style, grids n all? Does anyone know any good examples online of grids
    and/or double page spreads?  <BR> <BR>Keith, the tiling worked! Cheeeers! And
    yes it is rather hard to create &#34;deconstructive&#34; type on computer. <BR>
