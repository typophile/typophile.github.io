  really just starting. I've converted my drawn \"a\" and \"b\" to decent shapes and
  I'd like some feedback as to whether I should keep going.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In case anyone is curious, I've followed the advice of the posters, and stopped
    autotracing my sketches. I'm working slowly at this and hope to have my hamburgefonstiv
    and/or a complete basic alphabet by the end of March. Type design is fairly low
    priority at the moment, with a 20-month-old girl and another child on the way.
    Life's too short not to spend time with my wife and children when I have the time.\r\n\r\nBut
    this \"Furtive\" font continues to elude my grasp... I'm at around 1/2 way through
    redrawing my sketches into vectorized, TTF form..."
