body: hi, i found this one on the site of the stockholm&#39;s library. there&#39;s
  a pdf that lists &#34;biblio&#34; as a truetype in the document properties, but
  i do not know &#40;and myfonts.com doesn&#39;t, too&#41; a font named biblio...

  body: I think the finding that the font is called biblio in the PDF is almost everything
    needed to call this custom-made just for the Stockholm Library system.

    <BR> <BR>again the pdf does not contain an author &#40;as 10 others i checked&#41;
    and it&#39;s it definately called &#34;biblio&#34; and is available <BR>as truetype
    and type1 ... but that&#39;s it. really like to know who <BR>did it.'
