  body: The font is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/le-asterix/" target="_blank">Le
    Asterix</a>. It has all upper case letters but the ones from the shifted keys
    have a different shape, given a more realistic simulation of real printing. This
    has a bold version called Le Obelisk, which I didn&#39;t see at MyFonts

    it is</a>. You just had the spelling wrong. These are from the famous-everywhere-but-the-U.S.
    French comic strip <a href="http://www.asterix.tm.fr/france/actualites/asterisque2/pro_jou3.htm"
    target="_blank">Asterix</a>.

  body: Ah, yes, Obelix! Now I recall the spelling similarity in the two names. I
    think I have them both in my Guide, I just got too lazy to look for it.

    are classics. The original French  <BR>editions are hilarious, and it&#39;s incredible
    how the  <BR>authors do magic with language: countless delightful  <BR>word plays
    on every single page. And the references  <BR>to modern day history and numerous
    cameos by famous  <BR>personalities are gold. The comic books are even used  <BR>in
    school to teach French!'

  body: "I got a couple of the French editions as gifts in the late sixties when I
    was learning French in school. They were given to me by a collegue of my dad&#39;s
    from Denmark who stayed with us a few times when he was in the U.S. on business.
    I still have them, though they are very tattered now. A few years ago I started
    buying more of them &#40;a few in French, mostly in English&#41; to read to my
    daughter. We both love them. <i>Ast\xE9rix L\xE9gionnaire</i>, the first one I
    ever saw, is still my favorite."

  body: 'My mother collected the complete series. She bound  <BR>them into handy hardcover
    volumes of five or six  <BR>albums each. The great thing is you can read them  <BR>on
    so many levels: for kids it&#39;s very funny slapstick  <BR>and situation humour,
    but as you grow older and  <BR>reread them you start noticing the subtle word
    plays,   <BR>the celebrity cameos, the references to history,  <BR>politics, social
    issues, cultural preconceptions...  <BR>they&#39;re just great.'

  body: "As Charlie Brown would say: AAUGHH! The stuff in the word balloons in Asterix
    comics is LETTERING not FONTS or TYPOGRAPHY. *sigh* (One of my pet peeves is the
    way people refer to any kind of letter style as a \"font,\" regardless of whether
    it is actually a font or not.)\r\n\r\nI do enjoy the way they use different lettering
    styles in Asterix to indicate what language is being spoken. Clever."
