body: 'New Orleans is a city rich in originality. I think what makes this city so
  unique is all the different cultures that contribute to make new orleans what it
  is. living in this city for the past three years I have also found that it is a
  city rich in art. Here a lot of the art is influenced by new orleans culture and
  music. Here art is a way of living. When you look at the signage here it is always
  so lively, whether  it is the color, image or the way that the sign is made that
  makes it unique and outstanding. What I like the most is that there is a mix of
  type. It is not just serifs or san serifs. '
