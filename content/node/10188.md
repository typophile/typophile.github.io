body: 'I have noticed that lots of folks on the board have talked about the necessity
  of creating glyphs/characters which look a bit odd, eccentric, ugly or couterintuitivly
  shaped in order to get good flow in a text face in the course of discussing some
  other related topic. Has there been a thread that deals with this idea directly
  or in a more comprehensive manner?  <BR> <BR>examples: <BR> <BR>I was looking at
  Costa&#39;s &#40;Porchez Typofonderie&#41; bold/black &#39;a&#39; &amp; thinking
  how right this idea must be. It&#39;s an ugly duckling for sure on it&#39;s own
  &#40; I think &#41; &amp; yet it works very well. No doubt about that. <BR> <BR>CostaPTF<img

  <BR> <BR>Hrant has also talked about the need for a compressed looking &#39;g&#39;  &amp;
  the need to take special care with the &#39;r&#39;. &#40; the arm needs to be shorter
  than you might think no? &#41; <BR> <BR>Hrant said &#34; Your &#34;g&#34;s need
  help though. For the Roman, I&#39;d suggest giving it a bigger head and cramping
  the bottom &#40;natural in a text face&#41;&#34;  <BR> <BR>Anybody have a favorite
  &#39;ugly&#39; character?  <BR> <BR>Anybody have a list of characters that need
  of distortion in a text face?  And maybe a description of the ditortion recomended?'

  body: Eben, I understand that all opinion about design is purely subjective, but
    I wonder if you and I are seeing Costa in the same light? <BR> <BR>I do agree
    with Hrant that some characters, on their own, are bound to be a little odd looking.
    I also agree that it is for the good of the &#34;group&#34; that this occurs.
    But, how often does it happen? I personally do see some typefaces where a character
    is ugly--my opinion...all subjective--but if the designer knows--perhaps I need
    to read the whole thread first--what they are doing there doesn&#39;t have to
    be a lot of this occurring.

  body: I don&#39;t mean litterally &#39;ugly&#39;. That was hyperbole - it&#39;s
    true. <BR> <BR>I should clarify that I mean the top bold &#39;a&#39; specifically
    - not the italic form &amp; by ugly I don&#39;t mean disgusting or horrible but
    rather something odd or different from the other characters. Something suprising
    &amp; unprogramatic - maybe a little stinky even. An exception.  <BR> <BR>There
    are alot of examples of this kind of thing in other arts.  <BR> <BR>- In perfume
    you often need a stinky/musky smell to go with your pretty aromas in order to
    take attention &#40; musk &#41;  &amp; then reward that attention &#40; flower,
    fruits, spice etc. &#41;.  <BR> <BR>- In western musical theory you need some
    &#39;disonant&#39; or &#39;sad&#39; notes to go with your &#39;whole&#39; or &#39;happy&#39;
    notes to create a feeling of resolution - otherwise it just sounds a bit boring.
    <BR> <BR>- Vienamese food needs a bit of stinky fermented fish sauce &#40;which
    taken straight would be terrible&#41; - or it comes off as bland &amp; uncomplicated.
    The fish sauce provides interest. <BR> <BR>I am sure there are plenty of other
    examples &amp; probably better ones &amp; even the Coasta &#39;a&#39; may not
    be the best example of this exception in type - but the point is that type in
    general benefits from careful use of exceptions &amp; this is perhaps most true
    in a text face. <BR> <BR>I want to try to focus in on characters that benefit
    from being  exceptional in some way &amp; maybe even a bit distorted or stinky
    for a text face. <BR> <BR>I was hoping to do this without getting into the whole
    legibility/readabilty/baouma &#40;sp?&#41; debate - or a sellability debate &#40;
    Spiekermann&#39;s often related comment &#40;&#40;now paraphrased poorly by me&#41;&#41;
    that type designs with unusual shaped letters often sell better&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Anyway
    - no offence meant. Just the opposite in fact.

  body: I think Costa&#39;s letters are quite pretty, even the &#34;a&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>But I understand what you&#39;re saying. I think Gill Sans&#39; e and a are
    among the ugliest letters ever drawn. <BR> <BR>I suppose what&#39;s more important
    is how the shapes of the letters fit together to form readable word gestalts.
    That might require ugly letterforms from time to time.
