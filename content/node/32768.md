  Design</a> by Andrew Haslam and <a href=\"http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=79445\">Book
  Typography</a> by Ari Rafaeli.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if any of you have read them
  and, if you did, what do you think of them?\r\n\r\nI already own Book Design by
  Hendel, Designing Books by Hochuli and Notes on Book Design by Birdsall, do these
  two books bring any new information worth the purchase? "

    He could have had permission (1) if he asked, and (2) if the email was explained
    -- it was a private email to Rich Hendel and was a follow-up to a telephone conversation.
    Unless the phone conversation was included, the email made no sense -- which may
    have been his goal.\r\n\r\nHis real purpose seemed to be to get at Rich Hendel,
    who I both admire and call a friend. I take the whole thing as deceitful.\r\n\r\nWith
    that in background, I suppose anything I say about this being a more or less useless
    book, and not that well set or designed, will have to be viewed as biased. However,
    that is my view.\r\n\r\nCharles Ellertson"

    Eye magazine at\r\nhttp://www.eyemagazine.com/review.php?id=126&rid=606\r\n\r\nLast
    year at some point I borrowed a copy from my University library and read it; of
    the other titles you mention I know only 'Designing Books' by Jost Hochuli, but
    I suspect that they all might provide a bigger, and perhaps more balanced picture
    than 'Book Typography'."

    by Derek Birdsall\r\n\r\nThat one truly is an eyeopener. Esp. Birdsalls system
    of dealing with reproductions of art. A must have, imho.\r\n\r\n(PS \xB7 Rafaeli's
    book is a let down.)"
