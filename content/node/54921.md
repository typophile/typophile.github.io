body: "I'm looking for a good typeface for a thesis that contains Japanese (Mincho)
  characters. I have experimented with some fonts, including Aldine, Baskerville,
  Galliard, and Palatino. \r\n\r\nWhich one do you think looks best with the Japanese
  characters?\r\n\r\nWould you suggest any other font? \r\n\r\nI believe that a somewhat
  more oldstyle version of Galliard, i.e. less difference in linewith and maybe some
  diagonal stress - as in Aldine and Palatino -, would work quite well. I don't know
  how to systematically look for these smaller differences in font characteristics
  on the web, however, maybe there is some website that offeres a more refined classification
  scheme.\r\n\r\n(The Japanese font is the IPA Mincho Proportional, which looks a
  lot better than Japanese - or \"I'm not sure whether you want a Chinese or Japanese
  glyph, but this is what I have\" - fonts that come with some operating systems.
  The macrons above the o's are taken from Palatino, as they are not available for
  every font. So they don't fit perfectly and would need some further work - which
  I have postponed until I know which font I will use.)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tokyo_5408.png]"

  body: "I had not heard about any of the IPA (Information-Technology Promotion Agency,
    not the International Phonetic Alphabet) fonts before I read this. It looks like
    IPA, the Japanese government agency, freely released a suite of fonts including
    the Mincho Proportional.\r\n\r\nI think an important consideration is to match
    the overall colour. I find that Latins need to be somewhat light and airy with
    less stroke contrast and abundant x-height to match CJK typefaces well. Compare
    the Latins that come with the Japanese typeface, which are Century derivatives,
    with the original Century to see what I mean.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the
    Japanese-character content of your thesis is small, it may make more sense to
    choose a darker-than-average Japanese typeface to better match the Latin, although
    IPA Mincho Proportional seems to come in a single weight.\r\n\r\nI've used Palatino
    in the past for texts containing Korean. It's probably the best option out of
    widely available system fonts, but it still is too dark and the stroke contrast
    too high to work seamlessly with most CJK designs. Out of the above, I would judge
    that Aldine works best, having the least stroke contrast, but the hairlines are
    still way too thin.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can try a light weight of Adobe Warnock.
    You would have to adjust the point size to make it work with IPA Mincho Proportional,
    but it just might work."

  body: "Miss Tiffany, Jongseong, thank you very much for your feedback! It's probably
    not that easy to decide, and the choice depends probably a lot on the nature and
    the particular purpose of the text. Kozuko Mincho is quite similar to IPA Mincho.
    There are some things that I like better in the Kozuko font, some in the IPA font.
    Strangely, it seems to me as if there are some stylistic inconsistencies in both
    fonts, so that one part of character in the Kozuko would fit better in the IPA
    and vice versa. Garamond Premier Pro is definitely a good pair for both fonts,
    it just is a bit too elegant for a thesis (It's about finance and economics, not
    culture). Classical Garamond is a more \"standard\" font that also fits well,
    in my view. (There are quite a lot of Garamonds around, and the first Garamond
    I saw did not fit well, so I initially thought Garamond would not be a possible
    choice.)\r\n\r\nAs for the Adobe Warnock, it's not \"standard\" enough for a thesis,
    and it seems to be at least as \"bold\" as Galliard. It's a good choice for medium-sized
    texts that are more geared towards leisure activities and not work- or science-related.
    Palatino is widely used, and it's a good choice because it has a large set of
    glyphs. However, the serifs do not go so well with the \"serifs\" in the Japanese
    Mincho, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe latin characters in the IPA Mincho are very
    useful for the occasional western word or number in a Japanese text. (In fact,
    almost all western fonts look quite ugly when you have just a few western characeters
    in a Japanese text. Having a few Japanese characters in a Western text is not
    so much of a problem.)\r\n\r\nOverall colour (or grayness) is maybe a difficult
    issue. Japanese characters are quite different in grayness, depending mainly on
    the number of strokes in a character (compare \"Nihon\" and \"Shinjuku\" in the
    picture). So my question would rather be: if the whole text was not printed, but
    written by hand, would it be possible to draw both the Western and the Japanese
    with the same device? Apart from the boldness, Galliard seems to fit best according
    to this criteria. It's maybe because it does not have unneccessary round details,
    see the \"J\" for example. Garamond's thinner parts correspond well with the Japanese
    Mincho, but has more of the \"round details\". Aldine is somewhere in between.
    Think I have to see what works best with the math fonts, tables, display size
    elements, acronyms etc. before I'll make a choice. -- cs\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tokyo2_3979.png]"

    (Although the kanas in Kozuka Mincho are actually Kai-style, I suspect if his
    thesis only contain occasional Japanese phrases, most of the characters would
    be kanjis.)
