body: I am in need of both fonts in this logo. My customer needs decals made but does
  not know the fonts used for his company's logo. Any help is greatly appreciated.
  Thanks in advance. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SMITH_CO_MOTOR_CARS_black_and_white_3802.jpg]

  body: "I'm not certain if _Smith_ is a single font.\r\nThe _S_ is a fair match with
    Cartel URW Bold \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CartelURWBoldAsSmith_4042.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cartel/\r\nAs for the other letters in the logo,
    they remind me of Clarendon style serifs. URW Clarendon ExtraNarrow Bold\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/URWClarendonExtraNarrowBoldAsSmith_4472.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/clarendon/\r\nAlso
    there is some similarity of _mith_ to Neue Aachen SemiBold\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeueAachenSemiBoldAsSmith_3552.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/neue-aachen/ but Neue Aachen's Clarendon style
    serifs are truncated and too thick. However, it could be edited to match _mith_.\r\nDon"
