  from the original. We are trying to track down the original so the client can buy
  it, but nobody can even find it now... If anyone has any pointers, it would be much
  appreciated!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42595.jpg" alt="">

  body: It looks like one of the 300 Handwritten Fonts that were issued by ClickArt
    in 1995 on a CD collection, but looking through that catalog didn&#39;t show the
    same font. There are some similar fonts issued by various foundries. I have collected
    roughly 500 fonts of this hand printed style &#40;including the ClickArt fonts&#41;
    in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html" target="_blank">Part
    11</a> of my Script Font ID Guide, but you should realize that this font style
    can be easily and cheaply created. There are more freeware and one-of-a-kind handprinted
    fonts than you can start to hunt through, so my advice is usually just find something
    similar, and go with that.

  body: It&#39;s called &#34;Desert Dog HMK&#34;, from Hallmark. You might need to
    buy one of those Hallmark Greeting Card Creator programs &#40;probably can find
    one in a bargain bin for &#60;$10&#41; to get it.
