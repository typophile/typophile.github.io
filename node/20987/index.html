<p>Something is a bit off about the top of the e; I&rsquo;m not sure what. But the main problem are the diagonal characters&ndash;here vwy. To me they really stick out like sore thumbs&ndash;they don&rsquo;t seem like part of the same face. If you can find a more harmonious solution for these, I think this can be a winner.</p>

I agree with William about the general feeling and I think that there&rsquo;s something strange in the lowercase e&rsquo;s counter (it feels strange to have the upper right as an almost straight corner).
I love ligatures and the ones you&rsquo;ve designed so far are definitely interesting (I really love the &ldquo;gh&rdquo;), but the &ldquo;is&rdquo; and &ldquo;ts&rdquo; ones seem to slightly slip forward, especially when they&rsquo;re inside a word.
Are you planning also to add lining figures?</div>

<p>Although I love the slant of the &ldquo;y&rdquo;, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be playing nicely with the other letters. As William mentioned, it sticks out far too much. The &ldquo;f&rdquo; seems to have a bit of a funny slant to it as well - ever so slight, but noticeable in the smaller size.</p>
<p>This is a font on my &ldquo;Must Have&rdquo; list, Chris - elegant and different - inspirational!</p>

&ldquo;The “f” seems to have a bit of a funny slant to it as well &quot;</p>
<p>Is this only with certain glyphs or all? It may be the typical illusion you get with italic f where it seems to fall forward more than the others.  I will try back-slanting it a tad but, as you noticed, it is less visible when larger and I need to find the ballance point.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Chris. I like the new &lsquo;y&rsquo; better. But the &lsquo;v&rsquo; and &lsquo;w&rsquo; are still problems. To me because of the bent right diagonals they look like italic characters mistakenly dropped into a roman font. If you compare Souvenir, where he has bent diagonals, he bends both sides in the roman and carries it throughout the face, caps and lc alike, except for the z.</p>
<p>Here I think the v and w might work with just straight right sides like the y, or with your rounded corner serifs, this time turned outward to the right. Even with this the face will have lots of soft features, and will keep its overall look I think.</p>
<p>On the caps, my feeling is that there are too many serifs. The most successful semi-serif caps I think are Rotis Semi-Serif&rsquo;s and he just put one top left serif on everything. Somehow it works in combination with other caps or lc. It seems to be quite widely used. The only problem is the M. To me the top right vertex looks painfully chopped  off in Rotis semi-serif, and even more so here. So I would try adding a serif there&ndash;against what I am saying otherwise. Or if you don&rsquo;t, in any case the right stem of the M can be lightened with benefit I suspect.</p>
<p>The unique look of this face is that it manages to be soft but clean looking. Cooper Black is soft but not as clean. Sauna has something of it, but is more soft, with a lot of italic details. Here you have more sharpness.</p>
<p>Anyway, this I think is a unique look that still can be very usable&ndash;something not easy to achieve, but you&rsquo;re almost there, I think. Very impressive!</p>
<p>But I think it needs more consistency and a little more restraint to really become itself. Dr. Berkson&rsquo;s prescription: take two MFB (Morris Fuller Benton) pills and they will do wonders for you :)</p>

<p>I guess &ldquo;slip forward&rdquo; is not exactly a technical expression&hellip; What I meant is that looking at those two ligatures I have the feeling that they&rsquo;re about to (I&rsquo;m sorry but I really lack the appropriate word) fall on their back, by back meaning the left side of the glyph.
Now of course the more I look at them and the more my eyes get used so that feeling might just be something to do not take in consideration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite curious about how a lighter cut will look because I believe it will be really interesting as a text face.</p>

&ldquo;Now of course the more I look at them and the more my eyes get used so that feeling might just be something to do not take in consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of these things we see in type are &ldquo;illusions&rdquo; but that is the visual world we live in as designers. Some illusions are transient or are only affected in some rare glyph combinations and perhaps are not an issue.  Others may come into play often and need a correction&ndash;sometimes this is just a kern and sometimes a redraw is required.  The difficulty with a new typeface is that it has not settled yet in the viewers eyes and subsequent viewings may erase the problematic vision. I don&rsquo;t know if this is the case so we will let it percolate a bit longer :-)</p>
<p>This may well turn out to be a viable text face at the lighter weights. First I have to battle this weight through and hope you will help with comments on progress of all coming weights.</p>

The cap &ldquo;I&rdquo; can be confused with the lwercas &ldquo;l&rdquo; (elle) if I take out the serifs top right and bottom left. This opens the dilemma with the &ldquo;J&rdquo; and &ldquo;H&rdquo; so I am still fighting with it.</p>

<p>asymmetrical treatment</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you can do asymmetrical, like the y you did. My problem is not so much with asymmetrical as with consistency. You don&rsquo;t have the bent right diagonal in the kxyz, nor any of the caps (though you can follow somewhat different rules there). That&rsquo;s why it sticks out to my eyes. (by the way, I think the x with the two squiggles is too fussy and needs to be simplified.)</p>
<p>I pointed to MF Benton, because he took totally different styles like Broadway and Franklin Gothic and identified and carried through their logic with beautiful consistency and even color.</p>
<p>On the caps, like everything else, you can of course do anything you can pull off. Rotis semi-serif (not the semi-sans) is not geometric though not as modulated as much as Froggy. I was just pointing to it as one of the few successful semi-serifs to ponder.</p>
<p>Thinking about it further, I think the problem for my eyes with a lot of semi-serifs is that going half way, like on the current Froggy H, makes characters look mutilated to me.</p>
<p>I think you could also go the other way on the caps: eg put small serifs on everything in the Caps except the thin strokes&ndash;you are almost there in your current version anyway. Or some variation, but with just leaving a few serifs discretely off, so the absence of them does not shout at you.</p>
<p>Overall, I think there is a danger in trying to do too many things in one typeface. You have achieved a really nice distinctive look with your lower case, and I think the &lsquo;Benton pills&rsquo; would make you just create good caps that work with it, and not try to be too innovative on the caps. After all, Benton was going to do over 100 faces&ndash;and you are so full of interesting ideas, you just might as well!</p>

<p>Comma (and tilde) worries me a bit - too thin/light maybe?</p>
<p>I can see why you&rsquo;ve done the e like that (like the c and the f to a certain extent). But why isn&rsquo;t the r like it? I would prefer c, e and f to match the smooth and curvy r and not have the angle which is distracting.</p>
<p>If your H is going to have outer serifs, then shouldn&rsquo;t it have smooth curves on inside rather than corners. Like William B says, looks like some sort of chopping has occurred.</p>
<p>On the gh ligature I would make the g dominate and lose the pointy curve in favour of a gentler one inside.</p>
<p>j would benefit from more closely resembling the cap J which has a prettier hook.</p>
<p>I think William B is right, this would benefit massively from an audit and then a rigorous drive for consistency between characters. Hope that won&rsquo;t make it lose its character.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a robust concept though and I think I have sounded far too negative.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>

<p>I don’t want it to be just the typical treatment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christian Schwartz said something very thought provoking to me at Typecon last year: &ldquo;You have to resist the temptation to put too much of yourself into a typeface.&rdquo; By that I think he meant that the face has to  become itself, with its own nature. Like a child, it needs to be respected as having its own character, and the designer needs to work to realize that nature to the maximum. Once you have some basic ideas, it starts to have its own rules and nature, and resists you doing what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<p>So I am not against wanting to make any particular bit innovative. But I think that past a certain point making innovation a top priority can get in the way. Here you already have a concept that is really strong, which is an achievment. From my point of view, your challenge now is just to realize the concept most fully and effectively. I think if you <em>at this point</em> forget about being innovative and just be a servant of the typeface, it will end up with a very distinctive look anyway, and may be more effectively realized.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a typeface becomes <em>you</em> even when you consciously avoid it. Goudy argued against being personal in type, and throught we was not being personal. But of course almost everything of his came out shouting &lsquo;Goudy&rsquo;.</p>

<p>That is what I am trying to do.  I want it to be a servant of this typeface, not just a duplication of type solutions done with other typefaces. I guess what I am saying is that the best path is neither the conscious attempt at innovation nor the conscious attempt at avoiding innovation by just adopting often-used solutions lock-step. Sometimes just trying solutions in a naive way &ldquo;allows&rdquo; the typeface to bring its own force to bear.  As you said, &ldquo;Like a child, it needs to be respected as having its own character.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting. Nick Job was right the problem was not the v (version 3) but the w. You were right to stick with your guns on the v!</p>
<p>Your new w fits well with the face and has its playful quality. But it is still a little awkward. Perhaps thinning the far right diagonal  will be enough to balance it. And perhaps changing its angle a bit. Another thing would be to go a different way and do two of your left squiggles like on the v and y, with thinner straight right diagonals. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve tried and rejected that already.</p>
<p>I was just concentrating on structural stuff, but I agree with Nick Job that the s is too wide. Perhaps for that reason I find the ligatures with the s distracting. I hope that users will also have the option of a regular gg and gh, if for some reason they don&rsquo;t want to go with your playful ones.</p>
<p>Exciting to see you develop this, Chris!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, sorry i haven&rsquo;t been able to get to this sooner, but you&rsquo;ve come a long way!!! I looked at an earlier PDF, but i didn&rsquo;t have time to give it full attention till now. I like the new caps, the lower serif on the L bothers me most &ndash; it feels like a mistake to me. The tail of the Q feels like it was broken &ndash; like the O portion fell on it and it got squooshed. Do i see a rubby slipper on that foot sticking out from underneath? &gt;^p i also think the top of the c and the arm on the r should have the same treatment. i prefer the r with the smooth inner counter. smoothing out the c would also allow you to smooth out the e, which looks funny to me with that crick the way it is now. the s and e feel too wide, as does the v. i liked the old w construction better, it was just a bit wobbly before. the new w construction jumps out at me as you try to read text. is the tail on the eszett shorter than on the f? if so, why? the cedilla looks a bit alien to this face to me. your best characters imo are the g and r. the caps are very solid too. the lc just needs some quirks worked out to bring it all into harmony. keep up the good work!</div>

The eszett is shorter.  I didn&rsquo;t know it had to match the f.  I was going to make the long s match the dblss. I narrowed the s some in this last cut, do I need narrow it more?
The July 5th deadline is the last day to send entries from the Type Battle week stuff for the TypeCon show. See the post from Zara: “The deadline for submission is July 5, 2006.”</p>

<p>I think the assymetrical serif treatment is suitable. But why is the bottom right serif on the h i l m n r slightly curved, whereas the a d q is sharp? It seems to me that a d q are prime candidates for a softer touch. The upper internal curves of B D P R are a bit funny, although I suppose they are modelled heavily from the diagonal stroke contrast of the O. The three different stroke endings on the m are interesting, the progression from square to curved seif is nice. But does it work? LC r is rotating anti-clockwise when it sits alone, and a little more in text. The text settings have a slight bottom right to top left flow, which is up to you to decide whether you like it or not!</p>
<p>Otherwise, I think it is a great typeface. The italics and lighter weights will be nice to see.</p>

-X- The waist seems a hair too high.
-e- the counter seems out of place. I enjoy it, there&rsquo;s something nice about it, but maybe it needs to be exaggerated a little more.
-g- I think the ear needs a little more finesse or finessing. Or, maybe it is just a hair wide?
-w- there is still something off here. a little wide. maybe the curve on the last stem needs to go a little higher so the straight is not as long. that stems works in the -v- but it isn&rsquo;t quite working in the -w-.</p>
<p>Dez, you&rsquo;re going to have a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; -g- and -h- right? And allow us to have a disconnect -t- and -h-? And -i- and -s-. I find those ligatures off. Nothing personal. JFP&rsquo;s Costa has a ch ligature that I don&rsquo;t like either. There is something odd about the joining being at the bottom. (or something.)</p>
<p>Overall I think your numerals (figures) are a little to large. Only by a hair though.</p>
<p>Kris, I see the same thing as you in the lowercase -r-. I think it is a visual trick caused by the top serif facing left and the bottom curving under. But, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d try to correct it as I don&rsquo;t see it when it is in formation with the other letters.</p>

At text size you can&rsquo;t even tell. I added a Euro and some other stuff too.</p>

As you prefer the curves, though, having them in the right y diagonal as well is better.</p>
<p>The new Q doesn&rsquo;t work for me either; the descender is too heavy or something. As cute as it is on the g, the g ear shape doesn&rsquo;t seem to work on a descender; I suspect you need another shape.</p>

also, i&rsquo;m thinking that maybe some of the wonky spacing on the smallcaps is due to the nature of the semi-serif??? If so you may need to do quite a bit of kerning to iron these problems out. Can we see some all-caps settings to see if there is the same problem with the capitals?</div>

Where are you seeing the cropped rings? There is only one ring glyph being used in this font. I don&rsquo;t see any ring issues so far.
I will post a character set tonight when I get home and some all caps.  It strikes me that the semi-serif is a factor, particularly when you have a thin vertical with no serif (like the U) next to a bolder vertical with a serif (like an H).  The overall color mass with the thin stroke makes you want to tightenit but the lack of serif makes you want to loosen it.  Kern Baby, Kern? :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, I think figured out why the r looked off to me, or falling back, whereas the i does not. It is because your semi-serifs on the lc otherwise follow the rules of an italic.</p>
<p>In an italic the bottom of the r would normally not have a serif. This is probably a legacy of the fact that when an italic is written with a pen, the pen was reversed to rise for the arm, whereas with the i the pen was lifted as it moved right to make the next letter.</p>
<p>While it has a chirographic origin, there is also a visual logic to it. The other stems with a branch following&ndash;hmn&ndash;do not have serifs on the foot. So the r foot should not have a semi-serif by this logic.</p>
<p>Now you could also argue that with the r having its arm hanging out to the right, adding a right serif helps color. Probably true. But I think to violate visual expectations successfully, you you do you need to carry it throughout the type face. Here, the hmn follow the traditional pattern, so the r stands out&ndash;or falls over, as some of us think!</p>
<p>I like the current y better than the vw. I am wondering whether if the left arms of the vw were at a greater angle from the vertical, like the y, they would work with more perfect harmony, while keeping the liveliness of your design?</p>

<p>That was exactly my reasoning. The h n m do not have a large void at their right extremity so the pattern is different anyway. The h n m also have a serif at their right full-height verticals.  Since the r has only one full-height vertical,  it gets the serif.  I guess my system logic goes by different rules than yours with both being valid.</p>

<p>I wonder, if your &lsquo;visual logic&rsquo; is even color on the r with the bottom serif, if it would be better longer than others, as it often is in a full serif face? That might eliminate the &lsquo;falling over&rsquo; issue also.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, looking again at Froggy, I was wondering whether you have experimented with softening some of the corners on the caps.</p>
<p>This might bring the caps more in line with the delightful look of the lower case. For example you might round all corners opposite serifs, as in the lower case. Or you might just round diagonal corners, such as where the diagonals in AMNXYZ have joins with thins or serifs. The rounding might be less, but it would still soften it some, like the lower case&hellip;</p>

This, so far, is just the bold weight. When I start the normal weight, I will be more focused on text readability.  It is probably odd to see a type family begun with the bold weight first but, then again, I can be an odd fellow myself :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Looking again at Froggy in your new &lsquo;scary&rsquo; posters, it struck me that the only sw-ne diagonals in your lower case that are straight are the z and the second stroke in the w. I&rsquo;ve always had problems with the w, which you&rsquo;ve improved. Maybe tinkering with the second stoke would improve it still further in making it work more smoothly with the rest of the face. On the diagonal z, you have a good model in the sw-ne stroke of the x. I don&rsquo;t know if that would look too soft, but it might be worth a try if you haven&rsquo;t already. Anyway, Froggy will be a hit!</p>
