  body: "I have a few suggestions. \r\n\r\nWhen you find yourself frustrated, take
    a deep breath and step back. Sometimes you'll make mistakes that other people
    catch - that happens to all of us and is just part of being a human. Don't beat
    yourself up over it. And you definitely don't want to overthink your kerning,
    or you'll stop seeing the forest for the trees. \r\n\r\nThat might be a good metaphor
    for kerning... you want to focus on the forest, not the trees. Focus on the piece
    you are kerning as a whole, and try to find a good rhythm of the spaces within
    it. Try to think less of the letters as letters, but as shapes. If one of those
    trees is too far away from the other trees, just get it as close as you can without
    breaking the rhythm of the rest of the forest. If a particular pair is really
    bothering you, put it in a long string of Hs and Os so you can get a feel for
    the rhythm without getting caught up in reading the words. But then check the
    pair back in the word (and then the entire piece) it's in to make sure you haven't
    kerned the pair too tightly. Don't worry about measuring. It's a visual process,
    not a mathematical one. \r\n\r\nHard to describe without images... but I think
    the suggestions here are good so far. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps."

  body: "There are really several ways to approach kerning. Different for small text
    or for headlines, Serif or Sans fonts, Regular or Italics. But from experience,
    what worked for me as essential every time is prior to working on kerning, working
    the hardest on the actual basic spacing of each character. Trying out the most
    likely spacing that will work in most cases for that particular font. Indeed flip
    it, make negative space more visible and comparable, measure, even tweak the design,
    print out, look from a distance, stand on your hands...\r\n\r\nAnd then when you
    think the spacing is right, only then use kerning to compensate the shortcomings
    of each font. \r\n\r\nYou see, once you study and measure to adjust the spacing,
    you have a much much clearer *feel* of the right kerning needed. And most likely
    you'll need less kerning pairs than you thought.\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\nA"

    The only fonts I have are the ones I make and a few system fonts. It may be screen

    the most problematic pair in your line of type. And after fixing that you continue
    with the rest. And that is completely irrespective of the kind of type you want

    \u2014 the appearance of a pleasant tone on the page, where tracts of type stand

  body: "OP: back in the day when I used to spec, check, and correct/respace many,
    many headlines, Nick's \"Manual\" version would be a great \"tight no touch\"
    setting from the best NYC jobbing typographers. But James' comment is also valid,
    since the principle of optical spacing is balance above all else. Yet OTOH, much
    of the charm of setting a sans ultra tight is the uneven, frankly staccato negative
    spaces that result. This is exactly what is abhorred by those that encourage touching
    and overlapping letters at display sizes as a far less heinous crime than unbalanced
    counters. \r\n\r\nI've never seen 100% agreement on \"perfect\" kerning or display
    spacing. Check out Michael Harvey's Letterform Design, and Geoffrey Dowding's
    Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type, and Herb Lubalin's work with
    Benguiat, Carnase and DiSpigna for the touch, overlap, and razor-blade-edit-the-junctions
    school.\r\n\r\nStart with a target interletter space interval and try to replicate
    that throughout a word and then a phrase, adjusting wordspacing, then linespacing
    as needed.\r\n"

  body: "@typogirlie6\r\n\r\nKerning is completely subjective.\r\n\r\nBut, I think
    most individuals who have trained their eyes, and art directors or those in this
    business, can tell when a typeface is poorly spaced or fit improperly. Hopefully,
    if the type designer has done a good job, you shouldn't have to adjust the kerning
    that he/she has incorporated into their font(s). However, as I said, this is purely
    subjective, and even though the type designer does a good overall job kerning
    for average text usage and general overall body copy reading, does not mean that
    you cannot adjust the spacing or relationship between letters based on your sense
    of aesthetics.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the easiest way to review and adjust letter
    kerning combinations is to type out a word that uses a wide range of letters (with
    ascenders and descenders) in order to visualize and get a good sense of what id
    going on.\r\n\r\nI have always used this phrase in particular when kerning:\r\n\r\n\"Haightens
    3246\"\r\n\r\nThis short phrase has a good combination of letters (with a few
    numerals) which will give you a good overall sense of word spacing in the font.\r\n\r\nThen,
    I would change the first letter \"H\" to every single other capital letter...
    (A, B, C, D, etc.) all the way to cap Z.\r\n\r\nAlso, change the second letter
    after each capital (a, b, c, d, etc.) all the way to z.\r\n\r\nAnd observe the
    spacing and adjust (kern + or minus) when you feel that something needs an adjustment.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    in my opinion, I think that many people use much too much kerning.\r\n\r\nPay
    particular attention to these cap to lower case combinations (Fa, Ka, La, Pa,
    Ra, Ta, Va, Wa, Xa, Ya).\r\n\r\nAnd don't forget the punctuation between all capitals
    and lower case.\r\n\r\nThese usually require an adjustment depending on the point
    size when typesetting.\r\n\r\nAnd, that is pretty much it.\r\n\r\nHowever, if
    the initial font was spaced incorrectly or poorly, you may need to use the default
    'optical' fitting scheme in most applications, or go back and adjust the 'key'
    letters first.\r\n\r\nThese are capitals... \"HHOHOO\", l'case \"nnonoo\" and
    \"00\" two zero's.\r\n\r\nUnless these square to square, and square to round,
    and round to round, are not set up properly, kerning the entire font manually
    will be a nightmare.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this little lesson helpful.\r\n\r\nAnd
    do not second-guess your own individual sense of what looks good and what does
    not.\r\n\r\nWith time, anyone can become better at kerning. Good luck.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "First question: Is what you are setting small enough (in length) where you
    can be expected to kern everything by hand? Or is a lot of text involved, where
    the only sane thing is to use programmatic kerning?\r\n\r\nSecond thing: There
    is a lot of bad advice floating round out there. While kerning strictly occurs
    between two letters, the whole point is to make the words fit, look, and read
    better. General advice about, say, how much to kern an \"A\" after a \"W\" depends
    on what follows that \"A\". \r\n\r\nWhich is the reason for my first question:
    if kerning is programmatic, you don't know. It has to work for WAVE as well as
    WAREFARE. Programmatic kerning has to be looser, the kern must accommodate any
    following character. Etc. On the other hand, if you are adjusting things by hand,
    you can use slightly different amounts of kerning with the same pair, as that
    pair falls in different words.\r\n\r\nThe only exception to this is when reading
    the words is not as important as the graphic design. It does happen, but not as
    often as some designers think.\r\n\r\nOpinions by me."
