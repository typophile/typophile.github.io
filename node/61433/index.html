		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Jürgen.
Spacing is exactly what I was worried about. I&rsquo;m trying to install FontForge it&rsquo;s a bit complicated. I guess everything has a price, even a free software :)</p>
<p>I did make the V a bit wider and the A and Y as well

<img src="/images/old-images/DentalNewsTypophile4_3454.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The lowercase letters I have here are only a 60% scaling of the capitals
I find the X a bit awkward, the left counter space seems and huge and imbalanced but I don&rsquo;t know how to fix it.</p>

<p>A lot of the letters are still clumsy as drawings. And I realise I have inconsistencies in width and colour. But yeah I need help on that :)</p>
<p>I still think that this is more of a Semi-Bold compared to the intended result. It&rsquo;s really meant to be a text typeface for a magazine at something like 9/12. But I took Bendy&rsquo;s advise and drew most of the capitals to better judge the relationship between letters.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance guys.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry it&rsquo;s been a while but one of my Hard Drives went belly-up and I was working on recovering some of the files. I have lost a file where I had refined the serifs, but I don&rsquo;t think it was a great idea anyway, not at this stage at least.</p>
<p>I made the face lighter, I think what I have now will produce a better colour at text size. I used Karen Cheng&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Designing Type&rdquo; book to determine width relationships between letters and it&rsquo;s more of a classic proportions typeface. The original idea was to somehow blend Modern and Classic elements but I went with Classic instead. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll be identified as &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;R&rdquo; was indeed out of place. The skew on the O&rsquo;s counter was intentional but I guess it was too geometric, I adjusted that slightly I don&rsquo;t know maybe it still is awkward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve redrawn the counters for the B P &amp; R. I&rsquo;m satisfied with the stroke weight relationship now, but I could be wrong. Let&rsquo;s see what everyone thinks.</p>

<img src="/images/old-images/DentalNewsTypophileSpecimen!_3658.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I wanted to make a couple of notes on some of the letterforms, but I&rsquo;ll just wait for undistorted feedback (e.g. I&rsquo;m in a hurry to go to school :P)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The R is too Bemboesque. Also the flared M is going too much in the Renaissance style direction. As well as the broad-nip pen reminescence of the J. X is better, the downstroke of the K should be straight. The P’s stroke of the bowl is still too light, also the top one of B. The U is too wide. I’d also narrow the C a bit. The diagonal downstrokes of V, W, X and Y seem too thin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;d disagree with the last post. I think the classical R and M look good, but the J looks out of place. Maybe the curve on K and R could be reduced, but I don&rsquo;t think straight is necessary.
It&rsquo;s a bit difficult to judge how this looks from a small image. I&rsquo;d be interested to see a pdf and text in sentences. I think this is going to look very nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">(Back from work) Thank you I&rsquo;ve attached a PDF now.
the S and the U are clumsy drawings. I want to make the tail of the Q more pronounced. Other than that I&rsquo;m happy with the letterforms but it feels like the text doesn&rsquo;t flow consistently. The original intended use of the typeface was all-caps headings for my resumé so.
I started drawing the lower case but I would love to refine the caps first.
I&rsquo;m looking at a print out of that PDF and I think spacing is really poor and inconsistent I&rsquo;ll get me a font editor and start working on that soon.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, good improvements! I’m still not sure about the J: this detail is found nowhere else in that alphabet*. But you should elaborate a bit on the tail of the Q: that could be much longer &amp; more elegant.
The middle bar of H seems too heavy. Me thinks that the right upstroke of U is a bit too thin. And maybe the thin strokes of N a bit too heavy, whereas the diagonal could be slightly heavier.
The bow of D should have the same weight as the ones of O and C.
S should be haevier in the middle, work on the horizontal thin strokes at the top and the bottom, they are too different.
The U is still too wide. Place your X into the text as well to see what needs to be changed there. It drwas too much attention to its serifs.
The overall proportions look good now.</p>
<p>*) I know J is your initial, that is why you drew it first, but it looks like from a different alphabet.</p>
