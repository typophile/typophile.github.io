		<div class="commentbody"><p>ITC Bodoni Ornaments has a swelled rule. There is a PDF specimen at Sumner Stone&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/html_pages/BodoniOverview.html" target=new><a href="http://www.stonetypefoundry.com">www.stonetypefoundry.com</a></a></p>
<p>However, when I was setting swelled rules in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Moments-Ted-Williams/dp/1580175287/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-9781295-3414223?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182167452&sr=1-1" target=new><cite>Wild Moments</cite></a> (Storey Publishing), I found that to get the proportions I wanted, I had to create my own.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/1731-02_Spring-75_5498.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I chose to make up a dash in font format (Type 1: this was several years ago) so I could have it run along easily in text and be easier to implement than manually embedding a graphic over and over. There were hundreds of rules throughout the book. As a character in a font, I could also easily implement it in manuscript by running a GREP search sequence on the tagged AHs prior to importing.</p>
<p>I wanted the rule to be flexible and not fixed to a certain width, so I drew the rule to 2000 units (2 em). Then I used horizontal scaling in the app to adjust the rule to full measure. I had to experiment a little with the proportions between the swell and the thin ends and with the degree of taper. (It looks a little ragged in this screen-res rasterization, but it was fine in print.)</p>
<p>Setting the font size established the actual thickness of the rule and scaling set the width. I don&rsquo;t remember offhand the exact settings I wound up using, but the math was pretty straightforward because the width was twice the em and the swell was a known proportion of the em. (I do recall coming up against an upper limit on horizontal scaling.)</p>
<p>I defined the size and scaling in a paragraph style, for easy application and formatting through tagged text.</p>
<p>This probably sounds a lot more complicated than it actually was. Perhaps there&rsquo;s an easier method these days. At the time, I thought it was a rather elegant solution to achieve a classic decoration that you don&rsquo;t see much any more &ndash; precisely because it can be so tricky to implement in current technology.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An inspired response! Thank you Kent. ITC Bodoni Ornaments does indeed have a swelled rule, and oh so much more. A steal at $39. I&rsquo;ll have to buy it just to give adjusting its point size and horizontal scaling a try.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t work to my satisfaction, I may very well turn to my old Linotype catalogs and scan some samples. Perhaps I can still salvage my relationship with Illustrator.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and by the way, Wild Moments? Very nice, elegant.</p>
