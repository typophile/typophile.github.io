body: This is a post regarding  DAN SOLO and is book ART DECO. There is a font in
  the book called EARTH. I am of the opinion that is more to this alphabet than what
  is shown in the book. I do believe that there are more characters and punctuation
  and numbers. And so I do believe that the name in the book is not real name of this
  font. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/alpha earth1_3573.jpg] There are bound
  to be other books. With this alphabet in it and sources out there. With so many
  tv shows and movies using the font there is more to this than just what is shown.
  The DAN SOLO CAT of 4000 plus font samples shows there is more letters in this set.
  So where is the source of this font called EARTH. Where did DAN get it from and
  were are the studios and companies getting the other variations.  Any information
  please help.

  body: "I found the exact font listed as \"Ultraname\", dated 1992, as a shareware
    font. It does not appear to be available currently in all the major shareware
    collections on the web though -- at least under that name.\r\n\r\n[EDIT]\r\nI
    just got an email from the person who had the font listed as \"shareware\"; that
    was an error on his part. Gary Elfring published the font so it was commercial."

  body: "As far as I can deduce, Gary Elfring created the EARTH typeface family in
    the 1970's for use as a phototype font - a method of storing typographic characters
    on small film strips. These characters could be individually exposed using phototypesetting
    equipment and then pasted-up to form complete words or layouts. The completed
    layouts were then re-photographed and delivered to clients as slides, strips,
    or prints. This process was particularly popular with film studios who used phototypes/filmotypes
    for titling.\r\n\r\nHowever, digital technologies rendered phototypesetting obsolete
    towards the late 1980's. A few of the more unique typefaces designed for this
    process became unusable when phototype equipment was eventually phased out. Unfortunately,
    EARTH is one of those typefaces.\r\n\r\nElfring Fonts did create a digital version
    in the early 90's but, for reasons unknown, modified many of the characters. Perhaps
    there was a potential licensing issue as many companies used the EARTH typeface
    in logos.\r\n\r\nDan X. Solo probably had access to the requisite phototype equipment
    as many of his books were published during the 70's and 80's when phototypesetting
    was the lettering standard. This is also true of any other samples you may find.
    Most will be from the 70's to the very early 90's. I've seen it listed by Dan
    as EARTH/EARTHDAYS, and elsewhere as TELEMETRY - though this is likely just a
    clone of Elfring's digital EARTH font.\r\n\r\nOTHER APPEARANCES\r\n<strong>Sheller-Globe
    Corporation - Superior/RV/Coaches (Circa 1976)</strong> (logotype)\r\n<strong>Frederik
    Pohl - Gateway (1977)</strong> (title lettering, chapter headings) (http://smsa.org.au/assets/gateway-frederik-pohl.jpg)\r\n<strong>Warren
    Presents Alien Invasions Comix (1979)</strong> (title lettering)\r\n<strong>Charles
    Platt - Dream Makers: The Uncommon People Who Write Science Fiction (1980)</strong>
    (title lettering)\r\n<strong>Blade Runner (1982)</strong> (license plate props)\r\n<strong>TSR
    Star Frontiers Game (1982)</strong> (logotype)\r\n--- There's also a font based
    on this lettering known as Zebulon.\r\n<strong>Automan (1983)</strong> (opening
    titles)\r\n<strong>Quentin Corporation Disk Drives (1984)</strong> (logotype)\r\n<strong>The
    Terminator (1984)</strong> (opening titles, marketing materials)\r\n<strong>Tightrope
    (1984)</strong> (opening titles)\r\n<strong>Airwolf (1984)</strong> (opening titles)\r\n---
    The Airwolf Themes CD authors digitally remade the titling font as CairnsAIRWOLFBold
    and CairnsAIRWOLFExtraBold for exclusive use.\r\n<strong>Humanoid Defender (1985)</strong>
    (opening titles)\r\n<strong>Disneyland Star Tours Starspeeder Service Poster (1987)</strong>
    (logotype)\r\n<strong>Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)</strong> (opening titles,
    marketing materials)\r\n---A lighter weight used for the credits block on posters
    also resembles EARTH DEMI.\r\n<strong>Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003)</strong>
    (opening titles)\r\n---It should be noted that Pacific Title & Art Studio likely
    has/had a phototype copy of the typeface. Whether or not they digitized it for
    T3's titles is unknown but it looks a lot sharper and steady than its previous
    optical appearances.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hitachi</strong> also used it on various products
    and <strong>Roland</strong> also used it on much of their sound equipment.\r\n---
    As mentioned above, there is also a font based on the Roland equipment lettering
    called PBIO.\r\n\r\n@jjdowney_1980\r\nI can understand your ongoing quest to find
    a complete character set but I don't think it's very likely. Between the sources
    above you can determine the missing letters of the EARTH typeface. Some of the
    printed sources are also much sharper than the rounded/wobbly quality of the optical
    film titles. You could always contact Gary Elfring and see if he would be able
    to recreate a more accurate digital version for you."
