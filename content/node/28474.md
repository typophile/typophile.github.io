    vera is one of my favorites, though it only comes in standard and bold:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bitstream.com/font_rendering/products/dev_fonts/vera.html\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I think it works better as a display face than text face."

  body: Quality + free is very hard to find in a serif face. (There are however plenty
    of free, interesting one-off display faces). Georgia works great on screen, not
    so well in print, (but it was good enough for the Kerry campaign). Gentium is
    an interesting one, but I've never used it.

  body: What I meant is... you can more easily get away with a low-quality sans, if
    low quality is the look you're aiming for. But with serif faces, that approach
    rarely works.
