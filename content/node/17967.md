  body: I have run into this problem myself. It seems to affect applications which
    are not OT-aware. Deactivating and reactivating the fonts seems to fix it. Seems
    to be a bug in OS X.

  body: Miguel, as this doesn't seem to be Word specific I won't forward it to them.
    If you feel otherwise let me know. Still not heard back on the 'ding' bug - I'll
    chase that up.
