  have a scanner, but when i scan in the image,and go to the 'live trace' section

    them up a bit, and then try sending them through live trace again.. '

  body: Use the Pen tool and trace them manually, you're not going to get a super
    refined tracing with Auto Trace even though it seems pretty handy. I do drawing
    to vector conversions on an almost daily basis for one of my professors and manually
    is the only way to go.

    the work to be sharp, don't bother with Illustrator.

    bother with Illustrator's Auto Trace is what you mean, yeah? I guess I'm just
    in the mindset that after becoming quite proficient with the pen tool, primarily
    vectorizing letterforms which require fairly anal precision, it's just not right
    unless I do it by hand."

    if you need a clean, one line trace from a drawing. Magnus, your example is a
    perfect example of what it can do...I just had thoughts in the other direction.

    body: "Paul,\r\n\r\nThe Live Trace feature doesn't use a single line of Streamline
      code. Adobe did not develop Streamline and did not have rights to the code,
      they just distributed it.\r\n\r\nDavid,\r\n\r\nWhen you refer to \"Auto Trace\"
      (which you've done in multiple posts), do you mean the Live Trace feature in
      CS2, or do you mean the Auto Trace tool in earlier versions?\r\n\r\nThe two
      have very different capabilities, so it would be good to know which you mean,
      especially when making comparisons to Streamline.\r\n\r\nI agree that hand-tracing
      will always give the cleanest results. Personally I would not use any automatic
      tracing function of any program for letterforms or simple logos or other designs
      that should have precise geometric contours. Live Trace is at its strongest
      for posterizing photos or very complex but not precise images, where hand-tracing
      would be prohibitively time consuming, and some degree of impressionistic distortion
      is a desired design goal. Which probably is not the most relevant application
      to a typophile discussion."

    you said."

  body: "The main thing to bear in mind is that the higher resolution the scan the
    better autotrace will cope with it (albeit slowly and with too many points). There's
    a lot to be said for high resolution greyscale tiffs of pencil drawings rather
    than vector graphics, you will never achieve the same texture by tracing manually
    or by machine. That said, it is worth looking at the options for live trace in
    the drop down menu you can get very different results. If the drawings are intended
    to be smooth and untextured you are better off beziering by hand over a placed
    scan as trace creates compound paths which to my mind hamper revisions. Magnus'
    example looks good on screen at that size but zooming in tight there will be all
    sorts of marks that aren't pencil-like.\r\n\r\nI miss Dimensions (and to a lesser
    extent Streamline), I use it at home in classic mode.\r\nTim"

  body: "Live Trace and Live Paint can both be really powerful tools, if you throw
    the right kind of artwork at those filters.\r\n\r\nI never liked Adobe Streamline
    and have played around with it through several versions, starting with the one
    that shipped with Illustrator 4.0 back in the early 1990s. The problem is vector
    trash in the resulting conversions.\r\n\r\nVector trash isn't really all that
    bad if all you intend to do it send the artwork to print or post it on a web page.
    I work in a large custom sign manufacturing company. For my purposes, the artwork
    needs to be really clean or at least consist of all closed paths. Streamline would
    generate lots and lots of little, stroked 2 point line segments and lots of other
    open path segments which were absolutely useless.\r\n\r\nI agree about the comments
    on manually digitizing artwork. IMHO, Photoshop has the best pen tool and combination
    of keyboard shortcuts found in any program capable of making vector objects. Once
    you get used to the keyboard shortcuts it's fairly easy to accurately digitize
    sketches and other line art. However, if the artwork is technical in nature and
    not so \"organic\" it will be easier to do the work in Illustrator (or Freehand
    or CorelDRAW).\r\n\r\nPhotoshop's \"Make Work Path\" command can do wonders on
    quickly creating vector artwork from high contrast scanned images -and do so by
    creating paths which are usually always full closed loops. Naturally, you'll need
    to tweak the brightness/contrast settings and perhaps even use a few blur and
    sharpen passes. If the artwork is clean enough, fire up the Color Range dialog,
    play with the fuzziness slider and then create a selection. Then execute the Make
    Work Path command and export the resulting path to Illustrator format."
