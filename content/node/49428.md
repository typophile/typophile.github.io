body: "Im doing a project for my graphic design class. The goal is to create 3 unique
  brochures sharing a common thread. individually these brochures are about a single
  typeface the common thread is the classification, Slab Serifs. My selections are,
  Rockwell, Chaparral, and Lubalin Graph. I know that these arn't the best and that
  serifa and stymie would be better choices but i'm a student, and well that's all
  i can get my hands on. okay, so my question to you fellow type lovers is, does anyone
  know WHO created rockwell? I Keep Finding that Rockwell was created by Monotype
  Designs, But my instructor wants to know WHO created it. i assume it was a collective
  effort. the reason why its also important from a design perspective is because i
  need an image of the creator, and if the creator was a company instead of a single
  human being or a team, im going to need to find an image of a building and photoshop
  Monotype designs on the side of it. Not my style. \r\n\r\nOh and another question,
  does anyone know where i can find the three typefaces, Rockwell, Chaparral, and
  Lubalin Graph in use? I know that WHATTHEFONT.COM is useful at figuring out what
  font is used the only trouble is i have to HAVE the fonts in my cache, and i cant
  seem to find anything.\r\n\r\nId appreciate all the help i can get and i look forward
  to learning from you all."

    Lubalin Graph <em>is</em> the best example of slab serif. The book <em>U&lc: influencing
    design and typography</em> by John Berry has tons of great usage of Lubalin Graph
    since the book is primarily about Herb Lubalin. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/U-lc-Influencing-Design-Typography/dp/0972424091/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222395020&sr=8-1\">http://www.amazon.com/U-lc-Influencing-Design-Typography/dp/0972424091/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222395020&sr=8-1</a>"
