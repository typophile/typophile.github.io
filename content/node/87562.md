body: "Hello people,\r\n\r\nSomething very simple has been bothering me for a while
  now. The Grade for loq quality printing is usually the thickest (darkest). As far
  as I know, ink will spread more on low quality print/paper than high quality print/paper,
  and thus type will look darker on low quality print/paper. To compensate for this
  spreading, doesn't it make much more sense to make everything THINNER (LIGHTER)?\r\n\r\nI
  am sure there's a logical explenation for it, but I just don't get it. The inktraps
  make sense, because they compensate for the higher degree of spreading ink. Making
  everything darker, however, doesn't make much sense to me.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper"

  body: "Interesting question, Jasper. It would be useful to have more info about
    it.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, grades are not used just in view of printing quality. Example:
    text over a yellow background would be clearer if set with a slight darker grade,
    while over a soft gray background a lighter grade may be the best option. Another
    possibility is to combine bold from a lighter grade inside texts with a darker
    bold in titles \u2013to enforce an overall even type colour.\r\n\r\nConsidering
    the way many contemporary fonts are built (in order to keep legibility under unfavourable
    conditions) I thought grades for low quality printing would be subtly changed
    in two aspects: reduced contrast and weight.\r\n\r\nThe first change avoids excessive
    variations that can result from low print quality. In an extreme scenario, thin
    parts tends to be supressed while the thicker ones tend to be bolder. With less
    contrast, this effect is reduced \u2013again, due to a more even type colour.
    The second change ensures thin elements will keep expressiveness. But the thicker
    change may not be overdone or it will cause the problem you noted.\r\n\r\nAlthought
    these two changes are present is some fonts (Mercury, Chronicle), in other the
    grades are just thicker (Greta, Quiosco, The Serif). So, it seems there is another
    element to be considered when producing grades."

    and high speed printing, where ink very briefly touch paper. So, in order to avoid
    the \u201Cvanishing thins\u201D effect Igor mentions, you will use a darker grade
    (ideally with less stroke contrast too)."

  body: Is this 'vanashing thins' effect still an issue today. I know a newspaper
    printed in Lexicon, which has really thin joins, and it reads great. It might
    be just me, but I associate this 'vanashing thins' effect with outdated printing
    technology.

    There are many printed materials still suffering with this. Cheap softcover pocket
    books and small newspapers are usual examples. And an outdated printing technology
    is a typical low quality printing situation.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper you refer seems
    not to fit the low quality category."

    so weak, it dries before it goes anywhere. The heart of this question's answer
    is, how serious you are about designing grades, or at least ones that give a client
    the right option, or in the case of a more general product, give a range of users
    the right options. \r\n"

    not sure where you get this from. Perhaps you are conflating several different
    concepts in your use of the term \u201Cgrades.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe way the term is
    applied to fonts aimed at newspapers, it usually refers to a range of \u201Cweights\u201D
    (not really weights, per se \u2014 hence the specific term \u201Cgrade\u201D)
    encompassing both lighter and darker variations. The whole point of a graded series
    is to be able to select the variation that best suits one\u2019s printing environment.
    \r\n\r\nIn some cases, one part of a newspaper might be more heavily inked and
    benefit from a lighter grade, while another part of the paper might be printed
    on a higher quality paper (like a photo-heavy insert) and warrant a medium grade.
    The purpose, in these situations, is to be able to select different grades for
    different printing conditions so that the overall effect is one of consistency.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s
    some of the marketing text from Font Bureau\u2019s Readability Series PDF:\r\n\r\n\u201CFont
    Bureau has prepared four closely-spaced grades tuned to the variety of performance
    to be expected from a range of platemaking technologies and presses. Newspapers
    using transitional or hybrid output methods should really benefit from use of
    these fonts. A paper that prints feature or advance pages directly to negatives
    might do so with one version of the font, while choosing a lighter version for
    pages that go through paste-up (which typically increases dot gain and weight
    of the type). Text can be freely moved from section to section without affecting
    copyfit, since all weights are designed on a single set of character widths. Properly
    used, these fonts guarantee a consistent quality of text reproduction from front
    to back. Papers using only one production method still benefit from the grades,
    as they can choose the weight best matching their inking.\u201D\r\n\r\nHoefler
    & Frere-Jones speak similarly about their graded series:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100017\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/ask/recentTopic.php?rtID=89\r\n\r\nNow,
    if you\u2019re using the term \u201Cgrade\u201D to refer to different size-specific
    (so-called \u201Coptical\u201D) variants, then the slight weight difference has
    nothing to do with targeting different printing environments. The fact of the
    matter is that generally when you have the same typeface reproduced at different
    sizes, the smaller sizes will tend to appear optically lighter than the larger
    sizes. \r\n\r\nTo compensate for this, a size-specific design for smaller sizes
    will generally have a slightly heavier stem weight compared to a larger variant
    of the same style. \r\n\r\nOf course, stem weight is only one of the adjustments
    that might be made between size-specific variants. And, as you correctly surmised,
    if the type is intended for a printing environment with heavy ink gain, then in
    fact the stem weight on a smaller size might not need to be heavier. With heavy
    inking, the gain will be proportionally larger for a smaller size type and so,
    in fact, a lighter stem may be called for under certain circumstances. But these
    circumstances are fewer and fewer as offset printing quality seems to only get
    better.\r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re talking about grades, there are many interrelating
    factors and it\u2019s difficult to make blanket statements.\r\n"
