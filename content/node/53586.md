body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pepsi_5268_4921.jpg]\r\n\r\nI was in the
  supermarket last week and had the chance to take a photo of the new PEPSI logo side-by-side
  with the old version (see attachment).\r\n\r\nDo you feel it's a successful redesign?
  If you had to grade it, would would you give it? \r\n\r\nI've read reviews of this
  new logo on other websites and to my surprise I found that many people didn't like
  the change. For those who are wondering, the PEPSI circle is supposed to be a smirk
  (or smile face). There are two other PEPSI products that have similar circles, meant
  to express a smile, to a varying degree.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I love the new sans-serif
  geometric typeface in all lower case. I think it's forward-thinking. Does anyone
  know what font that is? The salient feature is that lowercase \"e.\"\r\n\r\nMy score:
  A"

    reminiscent of the wave in the PEPSI circle. I think the logo relates perfectly
    with the typeface. It was a great choice in my opinion.

    an improvement.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think pretty much everything of the new logo(s)
    is poorly executed. The smile concept of the logo doesn't really work; it hardly
    resembles a smile. The only nice element I can see in these is that the logo changes
    for the different types of cola.\r\n\r\nThen the typography... it just looks slightly
    off. It tries too hard to fit with the logo. But the waving crossbar of the 'e'
    is over the top. It's just one element too many in my opinion. The letters themselves
    also became strangely geometrical because they tried to fit it to the logo.\r\n\r\nUnderconsideration's

    Sure the logo is clean and updated look but I'm just wondering if the drastic
    shift in brand identity is a sign of desperation on the part of Pepsi. If you
    had looked at the new red/blue mark alone without the word "pepsi" would you know
    that it was Pepsi's logo? Brand recognition plays a big part in how I see this
    design change as not poorly designed but inappropriate at best.

  body: "The mark itself didn't need a redesign, but the new asymmetry feels fresh.
    (@mili I laughed about the airline comment, I thought the same thing). To Nick's
    point, this really is a new identity system, not a logo redesign. It should be
    considered as a whole, and is a huge improvement over where they've been. All
    over the place. Pepsi now has some class, in its own way, without having to copy
    Coca Cola's retro (classic) look. \r\n\r\nAs for the history of Pepsi-Cola, I
    agree it had some class back then as well. But when you're number two, you have
    to diferentiate and you have to try harder. Pepsi gets a high mark from my point
    of view on both counts.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed discovering that the mark changes with
    each drink in the Pepsi line-up -- although subtly. The unity of the new Pepsi
    line makes the Coca Cola, Vanilla Coke, Diet Coke and Coke Zero brands seem disjointed
    by comparison. Consider especially how the caffeine free (gold) flavors have always
    been the ugly after thought of soda brands. Pepsi has made caffeine free as appealing
    as the rest, and if not, more appealing. (I predict a resurgence of gold and white,
    in part thanks to the new \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM5_r786kUQ\">white
    gold</a>\" milk campaign.)\r\n\r\nThe advertising release on the other hand is
    odd to me. The advertising features a color palette foreign to any other Pepsi
    material (reminds me of Comcast's new FanCast site and palette). The advertising
    gives no mention of Pepsi, only vague references to love, sweet, pop, xoxo, &c.
    It generates intrigue, I'm sure as it's intended, but as Mili said earlier it
    looks like an airline mark.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joepemberton/3216089966/\"

    \"That's not clean and minimal! It's generic! It's got no personality. It's an
    un-identity!\" Then I cross my arms, stamp my feet, and glare.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion,
    the worst crime of the new logo is that the asymmetrical swoosh (grin, whatevahyacallit)
    <strong>visually references Coca Cola's trademark Dynamic Ribbon</strong>. It's
    like they sliced off a length of it, encircled it, and\u2014pow!\x1F\u2014new
    logo. \r\n\r\nI understand what they were going for and appreciate that they attempt
    to achieve a more modern and mature sensibility. I like that someone, somewhere
    up the chain, wanted to defy what other beverage companies are doing and simplify
    their packaging. I like the consistency across the product line, something Coke
    sorely lacks. But as a whole I think the rebranding falls short.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    I actually think the Tropicana redesign and accompanying campaign (\"squeeze\")
    is great and is a nice step forward for orange juice branding and marketing. \r\n\r\nSame
    goes for the Gatorade \"G\" campaign, which abandons the now all-too clich\xE9

    who particularly loved Tab soda... but maybe they're trying to make people think
    warm fuzzy nostalgic thoughts about the packaging?\r\n\r\nhttp://2aday.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/tab.jpg\r\n\r\n...I'm
    not that into it. I appreciate the 50s kinda look, because that's what I get from
    it, but overall... I'd rate it \"C\", for unnecessary, unremarkable, and generally
    pointless changes with a rather bland design.\r\n\r\nBUT, the good news is, it's
    Pepsi, and I don't think people are going to be switching brands because of the
    aesthetic. Probably.\r\n\r\nAlso, shortening \"Mountain Dew\" to \"MTN Dew?\"
    Really? Really?"

  body: I don't think the Pepsi mark has changed enough to suddenly look too much
    like Obama's mark, at least not more than it used to. Personally, the only resemblance
    I see is that it's a circle, and that it uses red, white and blue. But Pepsi has
    been using that for ages.

  body: A friend and I were actually discussing the new logo when we stumbled upon
    it in the supermarket a few months ago. I am a fan of the old logo and its two-dimensional
    look. But it has been around forever, at least as far as I can remember, so maybe
    my experience with pepsi is limited compared to those who are "older" than I am.
    I think that the new logo works better on some packaging versions more than on
    others. One thing that was off-putting to me was how on the regular cola packaging,
    the shade of blue that is used in the logo is different than that of the rest
    of the box/can. Whereas on the silver (diet) packaging it looks right at home
    - clean, modern, time for change. Pepsi Corp. has been revamping several of its
    logos and packagings lately. And while some enjoy the little swerve that the 'e'
    has, imitating the circular logo with its 'swoop', I really, really don't like
    that at all. Had I been in the room when they were making decisions on this I
    would have insisted that they not change a thing.

    is more balanced. I also feel its not in the best interest for Pepsi to change
    an already recognizable identity. Why recreate something that works?   '

    of you are looking to have this thread end. However, [[http://www.brandpackaging.com/CDA/Articles/Packaging_that_Sells/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000504262|Brand
    Packaging]] has an interesting ad/article featured on page 40 of last month's
    issue regarding [[http://www.glowelle.com/home.html|glowelle]] by Nestle. There
    seems to be a shifting to what is referred to as Beauty Juice. It's possible that
    Pepsi may be considering the jump to a different audience.\r\n\r\nThe new design
    may be more palatable to an older crowd rather than the younger generation fixed
    on energy drinks. While I think the old design was great for a more \"sporty\"
    look, this one may just look a bit dull up against other brands with bold reds,
    and yes...the use of gradients and shadows. But if the move is to produce a product
    more appealing to a different audience, then it's a good move; if not then it
    won't get much attention save for those who prefer the contents rather than the
    image. \r\n\r\nGlowelle's bottle was created by [[http://www.vitro.com/vitro_corporativo/ingles/portada.htm|Vitro]]
    and the bottle design by [[http://www.kuproductions.com/|Kenneth Ussenko Productions]].
    \r\n\r\nI would rate this design logo at a 6.5 adn the type layout at a 7.5 on
    a scale of 1-10 for many reasons already listed here in regards to the icon and
    typeface used. "
