    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> yes, that&#39;s the one. I even went to the PSYOPS site
    yesterday... <BR> <BR>Another thing Yves, there was once a link to a font/foundry
    that wasn&#39;t available for sale &#40;I think the authors are on these foruns
    too&#41;. Can&#39;t find the link on my bookmarks... The name of the font is &#34;something&#34;
    sans <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> There was even a topic where someone refered to it as NOT AGAIN. It
    had a simmilar vibe as this Reykjavik.

  body: No. I recall some green elemntes on a modern homepage for that font sample.
    Also recal they had something like 14 samples and the font I want was one of the
    last &#40;11/12?&#41;. My memory holes are strange I know.  <BR> <BR>The topic
    on typophile was a font id where that fonts was sugested but the &#34;author&#34;
    replied that only 2 or 3 persons had it and no way it was used. It&#39;s not Beta
    Sans also.
