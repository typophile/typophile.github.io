  I hope that a moderator sees this and removes the other.\r\n\r\nI have been asked
  to do some graphics for the Peter Hughes Burns Foundation as it seems that the person
  who did the original work is not around. I was given some rough raster drawings,
  which I decided to convert to vector, so that I have something to work with.\r\n\r\nI
  copied the graphics fine, but am having trouble identifying the fonts and wonder
  if somebody could help me?\r\n\r\nThe first one is on the main logo, found on the
  website on the top left hand corner of the page:\r\nhttp://peterhughesburnfoundation.org.au\r\n\r\nThe
  second is on this graphic:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/survivor_5963.jpg]\r\n\r\nBlessings
  and thank you in advance for your assistance,\r\nRoger Barnes\r\n\r\n\r\n"
