  bottom of movie posters. Usually the text is long and narrow as to \r\n\r\n1) Fit
  a large number of names\r\n2) Address legality issues between studios and their
  employees.\r\n\r\nCan anyone point me towards something in this family? Any help
  is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe font could be serif (as pictured below) or sans-serif,
  which I've often seen on movie posters...\r\n\r\nhttp://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.unzeit.de/poster/Big_Fish/Big_Fish_300.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.unzeit.de/detail/xl/xldet1463.htm&h=1400&w=989&sz=971&tbnid=Ftomvd9caKIJ:&tbnh=149&tbnw=105&hl=en&start=2&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dbig%2Bfish%2Bposter%26imgsz%3Dxxlarge%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN\r\n\r\n"
