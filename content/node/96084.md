  for Medi Mexi which is Mediterranean and Mexican grill combination. Anyone willing
  to come with a killer idea? design has to address cultural differences, sustainability,
  fresh, and good food. \r\n\r\nI also add my very poor design. please take a look
  at it and if you ant suggestions please feel free to tell me.\r\n\r\nTnanks"

  body: "Welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nFrom your comments (\"my very poor design\")
    I assume you're not a graphic designer, so I'm going to suggest that you consider
    hiring one. Establishing a visual identity for a restaurant is more than just
    coming up with a logo (although that's important, of course), it's also developing
    an attractive menu, a web site, advertising, signage, etc. All these things should
    be professional, work well together, and should reinforce the image you're trying
    to project. It will be money well spent to get some professional assistance. "

  body: "What James said. BTW a good logo doesn't need colors -and certainly not textures-
    to do its job. Although choosing one good color (in this case I'm feeling teal)
    for the overall look of the place is key.\r\n\r\nBTW if it's not too late I'd
    change the name to MedMex.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    name that was created prior to the huge proliferation of medical companies using
    \"med\"."

  body: I think you might do well to explore something a bit more subtle. The treatments
    and fonts feel a bit too stereotypical to me. The basis for my branding work is
    always a thorough briefing, digging deeper into the business, what makes them
    tick, etc. It also includes a demographic study of the target audience. From that
    point I narrow down the central essential messages the brand should communicate
    and begin word association and sketching. Usually this leads to dozens of ideas,
    which can be evaluated and iterated. Without seeing that process it is hard to
    say if this is successful. However, I would not be too interested to eat at a
    place with this logo, as I would expect medium quality food prepared quickly.

    it sounded as a medical company and there is a medical company in Mexico. So I
    gave up on that name.\r\nClubMed:  is also a hospitality company name... http://www.clubmed.com/cm/jsp/clubmed_welcome.jsp\r\n\r\nThere

  body: "MediMexi, I'd suggest looking for someone local (or within driving distance),
    if possible. It's much easier to get a sense of \"is this the right guy?\" when
    you meet them in person. And if they're helping with signage, you want someone
    who can visit your restaurant, tape mockups in place to see how they look, meet
    with your local sign contractor, etc.\r\n\r\nYou can find designers by doing a
    google for \"graphic designers [city name]\" or similar phrases,. If you have
    friends in the local business community ask if they have recommendations. \r\n\r\nMeet
    with several candidates, look at their portfolios, discuss what you need, and
    ask them to prepare estimates. When looking at their work, look for projects that
    are similar to yours and ask if you can contact those clients to see how the projects
    went.\r\n\r\nOn low-budget projects, college design students are a possibility,
    but remember that they may have limited real-world experience, especially when
    it comes to dealing with vendors (printers, sign fabricators, etc.)\r\n\r\nAnother
    possibility is to work with an out-of-town designer you found via the internet,
    which is increasingly common these days. Once again you should check out their
    portfolio, references, speak to some of their clients, get a written estimate,
    etc. \r\n\r\nAnd remember that you get what you pay for. Hourly rates can vary
    but their bid is a reflection of how much time they'll spend on your project.
    The low bidder isn't always the best deal. :)"

  body: I eat at Chipotle sometimes. Like the food. Wish the servings were a bit smaller
    & cheaper though; I can never finish one of their burritos in one sitting.

    my desert after lunch/dinner\r\n\r\n@James, I totally agree. Their portions are
    huge. That is the main reason I usually order two soft tacos. It is not any cheaper...On
    the other hand their charge too much for Guacamole...$1.86 seriously??? some people
    eat a whole lunch at mcdonalds for that price.\r\n\r\n@Hrant, I will do that ;)\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "You're right about the lack of deserts. Also the decor is rather plain. \r\n\r\nMediterranean
    and Mexican -- not sure how you design a restaurant's interior to combine those
    concepts. Do you ever watch Restaurant Impossible on the Food Network? I enjoy
    the restaurant makeovers.\r\n\r\nIf you want a more upscale look (both in graphic
    and interior design), you need to visually suggest those regions while avoiding
    the stereotypical cliches.  "
