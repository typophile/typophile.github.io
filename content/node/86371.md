  noticed this nice font on <strong>front</strong> cover of that compilation which
  reminds me on \"Meta\" but there are no serifs at all (number 1 for example).\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nhttp://home.arcor.de/EMD53/CD/CD109P/BravoHits24_2\r\n\r\nThe
  same font is on the <strong>back</strong> cover for <strong>artist</strong> text.\r\n\r\nBut
  then, <strong>title</strong> font has serifs.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"
