  and then deleting it together with the curves from and towards that node.\r\nIs
  this possible in FontLab Studio 5 for Macintosh (I can't figure out how)?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPieter"

    must apply the correct settings in \"Options\".\r\n\r\nGo to Tools>Options>Glyph
    Window>Advanced\r\nand check the box where it says \"Edit/delete command breaks
    contour\"\r\n\r\nThat's it\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nMagnus"

    line by clicking on the node and deleting or remove it by scrolling and deleting,
    which is pretty handy.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: ':) That''s nice but everyone should tell FontLab that there is a "delete"
    key on the keyboard, and all we really need is a "merge" option, like cmmd-M,
    or something, ''cause they''ve made something stupefying simple, into something
    just short of stupefying complex with zero additional functionality and even less
    additional ease of use.;) '
