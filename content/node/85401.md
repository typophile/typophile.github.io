  body: 'You can''t do a direct full conversion, but you can convert aspects of FL
    hinting to VTT compatible format. But you have to roll your own: there is no publicly
    available solution, to my knowledge.'

  body: "Sorry for delayed response.\r\n\r\nThis is what we did: we hired a Python
    programmer to write scripts that run from within FontLab that write out FL hinting
    in a format that is recognisable by VTT. I wasn't closely involved with this,
    so I can't give much in the way of detail. Our goal was to reduce the manual workload
    in VTT by automating the actual stem hints, while leaving the resulting VTT source
    in a state that enabled flexibility in subsequent editing. The scripts can take
    a variety of input from within FL, including PS stem hints, so we can leverage
    the Adobe PS autohinter.\r\n\r\nBasically, what you need is someone who can program
    and who can analyse the data structures for FL and VTT hinting and figure out
    how to map from one to the other."

  body: Sounds promising. Can the format that is recognizable by VTT, be writable
    into an open format? Or writable back to FL 'ints?

  body: "There are some incompatibilities between FL's internal representation of
    hints and what VTT does, so for example 'DoubleLinks' need to be translated into
    something that VTT will recognise before we do the export. And there is a lot
    one can do in VTT that simply isn't expressible in FL terms. So while you can
    translate from FL to VTT and probably at least some data from VTT to FL, you can't
    do lossless round-tripping.\r\n\r\nOn the VTT side, there are multiple ways of
    representing hinting (visual, VTT Talk, raw instruction code), not all of which
    are perfectly able to express each other, e.g. there are some things you can only
    do in the raw code. If I recall correctly, our FL-to-VTT tools write VTT Talk."

  body: "How do you import the VTT Talk code into VTT? I guess copy&paste for each
    glyph is not an option ;)\r\n\r\nOr are you writing the VTT-specific tables (TSI*)
    directly into the TTF?"

  body: "To be honest, I don't know exactly how our FL-to-VTT process works, since
    I didn't spec the scripts and I'm not the person who uses them. I'm also not sure
    how much detail Ross is comfortable sharing: I just wanted to confirm for Frode
    that it is possible and give some indication of what is necessary in order to
    do it.\r\n\r\nTom Phinney mentioned to me that he's aware of four independent
    FL-to-VTT workflows, including ours, and I suspect they all differ in various
    ways: there are quite a lot of options in terms of how it can be done, and some
    of the decisions will reflect hinting strategies, i.e. what you want to be able
    to do in VTT with the imported data and how you like it arranged. For example,
    do you want to try to write CVTs based on the FL hinting, or do you want to map
    to existing CVTs in a VTT source, or do you want this to be an option?"

  body: That's fine, I was just curious. If I would plan something like that, I'd
    probably go for the extra font tables. At a glance, their format seems easy enough
    to figure out.

  body: "Jens, I agree. The VTT private table structure is fairly straightforward,
    so writing those directly makes sense (and is likely what our tools do, although
    I note an export option to write to a log also). I'm aware of some other VTT table
    munging tools that colleagues have developed over the years, e.g. to modify the
    glyph order of a font that contains VTT tables without mucking up the hint sources.\r\n\r\nFrode,
    we in this case is Ross Mills and me, i.e. Tiro Typeworks. Ross does all our VTT
    hinting work -- which is why I'm a bit vague about some of the details of our
    FL-to-VTT workflow --; we hired a Python programmer to analyse the data structures
    with Ross and write the export scripts for us."
