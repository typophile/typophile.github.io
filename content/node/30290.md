body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nMy registration for Typophile FINALLY kicked in after 2 weeks
  (and 1 day) of waiting for my activation e-mail.  So, I'm celebrating by requesting
  the name of a font, if at all possible. :-P\r\n\r\nThis is an unusual request -
  many people on here are asking for typefaces used in magazines, films, etc. ...
  the typeface I'm looking for comes from a game.  As the name implies, and as you're
  probably wondering when I'm going to get around what I'm actually asking for, the
  font used in the dialogue bubbles in \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" for
  Nintendo 64 (the good old days).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greatdeku_3866.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  is just a sample... other (more complete) examples are:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zelda1_3698.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zeldasecond18_5494.jpg]\r\n\r\n(Please
  note: this font is used for both Nintendo 64 games...Ocarina of Time as well as
  Majora's Mask.)  The most prominent feature, to me at least, is the way the exclamation
  mark seems to be curved/slanted slightly...also the roundness of the font is noticeable...\r\n\r\nI've
  been wondering this for ages, and I do apologize for the lengthy post.  Any help/guidance
  would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-BT7"

  body: I wonder if the exclamation mark in the face itself was done in italic. If
    so, this one could be fairly easy to spot.

  body: I looked around for a while, but couldn't ID it. It seems to be a modulated
    sans-serif, along the lines of the much-discussed <a href=http://beorcana.com/welcome.html>Beorcana</a>.
    I checked out <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/>Optima</a>,
    as well as Amira, Amerigo, and others on MyFonts, to no avail. <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/renova/>Renova
    EF</a> is the closest match I've found so far, but it was designed in 2006. The
    font used on the Wii's menus has yet to be identified as well, so maybe Nintendo
    gets all their typefaces from one, midly obscure source.

  body: "I'm thinking this was custom and Nintendo had developed it internally, they've
    always had the creative talent. It's very possible this font has only ever existed
    as single character bitmaps created for the game. \r\n\r\nThere were quite a few
    N64 games they released that had unique typefaces I'd never seen before (e.g.
    there was a great script in Mario Kart 64) or since."

  body: "Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nIt's quite possible that this IS a Nintendo-bitmapped
    font...that possibility actually never occurred to me, although now it makes all
    the   sense in the world.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's a sense of familiarity about
    the font ... I'm not sure why...Beorcana actually looks fairly close.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if it's the font or the fact that I've been playing these two games since
    they first came out that the font is so strikingly reminiscent of some other font
    ...\r\n\r\nThanks for all your help so far!\r\n-BT7"

    At least that might make a printable substitute, if the game uses only a bitmap
    font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: A lot of typefaces for games are custom made (or 'evolved', ahem) for a number
    of reasons, including copyright. I suggest this one might be a custom, especially
    considering the low resolution available for the game designers for these particular
    games.
