  body: The more I look at it the more it seems different from the original logo...
    <BR>B is different and so are the serifs on E and F. <BR> <BR>:-&#40;

  body: Friz Quadrata is probably the closest, although its not exactly the same,
    maybe theres a version from a different foundry thats the same, or maybe its another
    typeface altogether. <BR> <BR>thanks for your help guys.
