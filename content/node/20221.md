body: "I'm designing some logo options for a company involved in the plumbing industry.
  I have vague memories of seeing a font that looked like the letters were created
  using pipe fittings but I can't remember much else. Anyone have any thoughts on
  possible fonts that fit this description? If all else fails, I'll probably go to
  the hardware store, create the letters I need from actual pipe fittings, take a
  photo, and manipulate the photos to suit my needs. But I suspect a ready-made font
  would make my life a heckuva lot easier! Thanks in advance for anyone that can help!\r\nAnne"

      works (pun intended). I was hoping for some lowercase options. :-)

    body: I would absolutely love to, but the client is pretty excited about the concept
      he came up with. <sigh> I'm offering several other logo options, but I would
      be quite negligent if I didn't use his idea as one of the options.

  body: "I agree, formlos, and I usually do try to educate the client, but there are
    quite a few unique circumstances in this particular instance. However, there are
    very clever, creative ways of encouraging a client to avoid the cheesy design
    that they initially wanted and instead pick a classier, better designed option
    (for example, \"oh, gee, there are just no fonts that include lowercase letters
    you wanted...here's a version with pipe fittings in uppercase, but look at this
    other design over here - it includes the lowercase you wanted, blah, blah, blah\").\r\n\r\nThanks
    for all the help, everyone! You've given me a lot of really good ideas."
