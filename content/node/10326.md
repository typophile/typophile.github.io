    But, I think it may work even better if the blue &#39;Planet&#39; would be as
    rough and uneven as &#39;Healthy, Money, Healthy, Planet&#39;.. &#41;</i>

  body: I like it, in general, but I have two concerns.  <BR> <BR>1&#41; I think the
    blue marble needs something. The roughness that Dav envisions might be better
    accomplished by putting in the continents on the planet. They can be pale and
    not stand out too much. <BR> <BR>2&#41; More of a problem. Why is a distressed,
    cutout letter template indicative of &#34;healthy&#34; or &#34;money&#34;? The
    more I look at it, the less I think it fits.

  body: The more they looked at it, the less they liked it as well. Which is a shame,
    as the the client initially loved it, until he showed his sales staff. So now
    I have to change it! Yay, time to make it betterer.

  body: 'Kris, the problem I had with the project is it isn&#39;t informative. What
    is it a checking account? Posters are ment to be painfully clear in a moments
    notice. You need a tagline like: The &#40;product/account&#41; to lead to a healthy
    planet. Once you have the communications problem solved the graphic should be
    easier.'

  body: I assumed it was a book cover. I would go for a more robust/healthy illustration.

  body: Gee whizz, I didn&#39;t even state what it is! Tim is correct, it&#39;s a
    book cover, causing me no end of problems. Thanks for the advice Daniel, I will
    think about from a different angle.

    will be picking this one up in the book stores for a closer look.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    retouch the photo a little bit in Photoshop?  Make some of the shadows a little
    bit softer, etc.\r\n\r\nGreat work!"

    by just playing around with software. (something I'm forced to see - and do -
    almost everyday at work).\r\n\r\nYou have to think, and then *do* something. \r\n\r\nCongratulations
    :)"

  body: Yeah, love the new concept. Have you considered making the position of the
    leaves less uniform? Maybe you could tilt the top one counter-clockwise and the
    bottom one clockwise, and bleed them off the page a touch. I'm also finding the
    yellow a little overpowering. How about making the band transparent, or a muted
    green? Dollar green?
