    e-book readers before. They haven't taken off without becoming full featured PDAs
    or notebook PCs in the process. What I find interesting is that the article mentions
    that books will be available for 25% less than hardcover price. That's not exactly
    a bargain. Paperbacks are cheaper than that and they have actual manufacturing
    costs involved.\r\n\r\nAt least it will read text files and PDFs. Now that software
    manuals are rarely printed anymore, I'd like to read them away from my computer
    from time to time, at least to not block the limited screen space while I'm working
    on it.\r\n\r\nBut in terms of e-ink, how fast is the display? Is it only suited
    to static text and images, or can the pixels be switched fast enough for smooth
    animation? Are the pixels binary or can they be partially rotated to produce grayscale
    images? These questions the article does not answer."

    the technology.\r\n\r\nHowever, now that they are at the resolution of paper,
    it probably makes our jobs a lot easier.\r\n\r\nThat said, books will never disappear.
    ;o)\r\n\r\nCuttlefish...I don't think 'e-ink' is meant to emulate anything other
    than ink. While it likely can do animations and the like, I think it's main purpose
    at this point is eventually emulate true in on a reflective surface. One of the
    benefits is that it doesn't require a constant power source. Once the ink is 'printed'
    it stays that way without a need for more power. While this is certainly a benefit
    for reading static text, it's dissappears if we start talking about animations."

    that is utilizing this. somewhere i had heard microsoft was working on using this
    technology for one of their xbox360 game packages. and if i'm right, it was a
    color version of this"

    still too low - around 100dpi - but that the surface doesn't emit light and instead
    reflects light from your surroundings is a treat for your eyes and makes all the
    difference.\r\n\r\nWhile it leaves a lot to be desired in its current form, in
    my mind it proves the category and I don't doubt that I'll have an e-book reader
    of some kind in my bag within the next five years.\r\n\r\n"

    by 2008. For example:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2172127/paper-heralds-computing\r\n\r\nSome
    other general links:\r\n\r\nhttp://news.zdnet.com/2110-9584_22-6134401.html\r\n\r\nhttp://news.zdnet.com/2100-1040_22-5903090.html?tag=nl\r\n\r\nFWIW,
    e-books and e-newspapers aren't the only potential uses. I looked at electronic
    paper several years ago for a US Navy project to replace paper onboard, umm, certain
    ships, but the technology wasn't good enough then. The idea was to put all the
    technical data on a central server and use a wireless network to send data to
    tablet-sized pieces of e-paper. The e-paper would also have been enabled to talk
    to the equipment of interest, the ship, and other shipboard and shore databases
    to transfer relevant data back and forth. The whole thing would have been a way
    to deliver just-in-time and \"just as needed\" data.\r\n\r\nThere's also the whole
    wearable computing thing to think about, too. Imagine a piece of clothing also
    being a piece of network enabled e-paper... what will social networking be like
    then?"

    a huge disservice - I expressed my disappointment in the Sony Reader, but stumbled

    (via http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/29/starebook-stk-101-reviewed/) - until these
    guys start producing typography that comes close to the cheapest paperback book
    quality, the e-ink-e-book is going nowhere :-( which is a huge shame because the
    technology is pretty cool.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"
