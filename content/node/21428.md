body: "All the talk about <cite>Superman</cite> titles in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/21019\"><cite>Typography
  in New Superman Movie</cite> thread</a> has got my curiosity piqued: What <em>was</em>
  the typeface used for the titles in the original <cite>Superman: The Movie</cite>?\r\n\r\nHere's
  a representative frame I grabbed from my DVD:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Superman_titles_original_3617.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
  Bobby Henderson has said in the other thread, it looks a little like Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nThe
  closest overall match I've been able to find is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/granby/\">Granby</a>
  (which according to <a href=\"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/stephensonblake.txt\">this
  article</a> was based in part on Gill Sans). But it's still significantly different
  from the original.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick-and-dirty rendition I've thrown together
  using <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/granby/ef-extra-bold/\">Granby EF
  Extra Bold</a>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Superman_titles_Granby_5558.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  it looks a little odd, it's because I've fudged the spacing to match that of the
  original -- which doesn't really work, since the widths of many of the individual
  characters don't match. I've avoided the temptation to stretch or squoosh anything
  to make the spacing look better.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, some of the characters,
  such as <cite>P</cite> and <cite>R</cite>, are way off.\r\n\r\nCan anyone find a
  closer match?"

  body: "FWIW I think you have found the closest match. Gotham and Govan have rather
    similar letterforms, but are not as close as Granby (and too new to be used for
    the movie, which was made in 1978). Granby Medium has more open counters and the
    R leg farther from the stem, but other proportions and letters like the J and
    C seem less like the Extra Bold. It's probable that photolettering was used at
    that time, and tweaking widths might have been relatively easy, but the wide variety
    of Sans faces available to them may have included this exact typeface, but I was
    unable to locate the match in my Photolettering catalogs in a cursory scan. Perhaps
    more detailed hunt would locate it, but my point is that you have probably found
    the closest digital font match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    outline typeface family called Bryant Open that has the same G, M and R shapes,
    and a very close S in one of the more compressed versions. The samples do not
    show the J, which would be the other clincher.\r\n\r\nSince Photo-Lettering wasn't
    the only one making film types, this may not mean much in terms of my basic point
    -- that you have probably found the best available digital equivalent.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Thanks for your responses, guys.\r\n\r\nChris: It's not a screen grab of
    a DVD played onscreen; it's a frame grab from the DVD MPEG2 video stream itself,
    which I have then manually cropped and stretched to the proper aspect ratio. (The
    DVD is encoded in anamorphic widescreen, so it is easy to figure out precisely
    how much to crop and stretch, by using simple arithmetic.) The resulting frame
    has an aspect ratio of 2.32:1, which is only around 1% off the original theatrical
    aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The tiny discrepancy can be accounted for by small roundoff
    errors introduced by encoding into the relatively low-resolution DVD frame. Whatever
    distortion is present should be visually negligible -- certainly not enough to
    account for the large differences seen in Granby EF Extra Bold. I suspect that
    the internal inconsistencies you've pointed out in <cite>C</cite> et al. were
    already present in the original film.\r\n\r\nMike: Thanks for taking the time
    to go through your catalogs. It's good to hear confirmation that I have likely
    already found the closest digital equivalent. I do have to admit that I'm curious
    about this Bryant Open family that you've managed to find. If it's not too much
    to ask, would it be possible for you to upload some scans if you have the time?
    I'm idly considering a personal project to render my own version of the <cite>Superman
    Returns</cite> main title sequence in a more faithful <cite>Superman: The Movie</cite>
    style. Access to clean facsimiles of the original letterforms would be a big time
    saver."

    Volume 2, where I found these does include some very tiny samples in the back
    of the book that show other letters from each typeface, but even there the samples
    do not show the entire alphabet. I am not claiming that this is the exact typeface
    used, but it seems very close, and shows that there was a wider variety of film-typefaces
    than were ever converted to digital format.\r\n\r\nAs for making a scan, I'd be
    happy to do it, but I can't upload it to this thread, because this new 'improved'
    Typophile only allows that with newer operating systems than mine. I will have
    to set up a web page for it, and maybe someone can copy and post it.\r\n\r\nI

    that in. Thank you, Mike! I appreciate it very much.\r\n\r\nWes, the end-result
    of the project I was talking about was not the font itself but rather a full replacement
    main title sequence for <cite>Superman Returns</cite> in the style of the original
    <cite>Superman: The Movie</cite>.\r\n\r\nConsidering that I'd pretty much have
    to make the font in order to be able to do that, it would be a shame if I kept
    the font to myself. Unfortunately, I didn't design Bryant Open, so I think the
    legality of releasing a digital version of the font might be dubious. (And if
    I also used Granby as a basis for the missing letters... well, I didn't design
    that either.)\r\n\r\nAm I correct in my thinking? Thoughts, anyone?"

    by House Industries, I think you might have to let that one go, but then Bryant
    Open was only <em>similar</em> to the lettering in those movie credits. If you
    digitized something that was as close to the credits as possible, it would probably
    be your own digitization. If I understand our copyright laws in the US, only the
    names are copyrightable anyway, which seems dumb. I think this is the reason so
    many re-named versions of things are allowed to exist, but I may be wrong about
    that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    aside, is it <em>right</em>? I don't know. My feeling is that this is a gray area.
    It seems that as long as a type design is sufficiently old (e.g., Garamond), no
    one has a problem with it being digitized and sold for profit by a multitude of
    independent outfits. When a design is relatively new (e.g., Palatino), redigitizations
    are heavily looked down upon -- even if they share no curves or points, and have
    a completely different name.\r\n\r\nWhere exactly does one draw the line? I don't
