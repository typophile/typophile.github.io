    (available via Google Fonts).\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s one handy thing to know: If you
    want to identify a webfont, you can select the text that uses it, right-click
    on your selection and then select \u2018Inspect Element\u2019 from the context
    menu (in Firefox and Chrome). The font name will be shown on the right-hand side
    in the panel at the bottom of the screen. You might want to click on the tab \u2018Fonts\u2019
    in Firefox or \u2018Computed\u2019 in Chrome for a neater overview."

    it in the future). \r\nOther handy option for Chrome user only: Chrome [[http://chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html|WhatFont]]
    app by Chengyin Liu. Click the toolbar app icon and simply hover html text to
    reveal the webfont name."
