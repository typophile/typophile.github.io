  by an institutions for learning... (schools, Academy's....) reason i'm asking is
  because i was reading this article about how allot of institutions use bad identity,
  that being said the article only talked about how bad it was without going into
  much detail. i'm sure there are some verry solid and well tought out logo's for
  learning institutions. Would be sweet if you fine people could point me out a few.\r\n\r\n"
