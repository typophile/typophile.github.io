  body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nUli> Did Linotype ever make a digitization of Antikva Margaret?
    Was 1984 prior to digital?\r\n\r\nZwoelf> That would be fabulous! Thank you.\r\n\r\nJan>
    I was looking too see if there was some new interesting information on Ed\xEDt
    Zigany's Pannon Antikva. There is:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.font.hu/digitart/zigany.html\r\n\r\nMr.
    Nagy's link came up first though. N\xE9phont has done a revival of Pannon. Very
    warm and beautiful. However there seems to be technical (spacing) issues with
    that font. The italic f and g are not working for me. Garth and Gentium are both
    very similar to Pannon in warmth but not the same.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nepfont.hu/index.php?type=cash&font=pannonantiqua.font&ver2=2&version=regsc\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/garth_graphic/\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_design\r\n\r\nI
    started looking at Hungarian types when I spotted an art friend's business card
    set in Antikva Margaret. I began a search that led me to a fabulous document by
    the Hungarian LaTeX group. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb24-3/bujdoso.pdf\r\n\r\nAfter
    reading the above PDF document I fell immediately in love with Aquamarine too
    and purchased it soon afterwards. Sadly, no one has taken up the challenge to
    faithful restore Margaret to her original beauty. :-(\r\n\r\nWhomp whooommp waaaaa.

    1984 (publication date of the catalog). For technical details read the final pages
    of the 1984 catalog:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/antikva2.jpg"
