    <BR>Can&#39;t be very hard to add that, can it? <BR> <BR>The problem with News
    is that it&#39;s screened: it can take a while for one of the moderators to clear
    it for posting. In fact some of my posts to the News forum have never shown up.

  body: I&#39;m the one that clears the News &amp; Events. The only posts that don&#39;t
    get cleared are either blatant spam or responses to the posts. The News area isn&#39;t
    a public forum, it is a place to post newsworthy items. Sometimes if I feel something
    is more or less something that needs to be discussed I&#39;ll email the person
    who has queued it and ask them to start a thread.
