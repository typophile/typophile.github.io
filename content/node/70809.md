    long. And why would you draw such generic style characters for a logo. You should
    either use a good existing font, or do something more original. To me it now looks
    like a bad Times copy.\r\n\r\nThis is just an example:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gr2_5375_5180.png]"

  body: "I would drop the dots, they don't help with the website address and the name
    itself is already naturally FD STIL because of the ligatured letters.\r\n\r\nHowever
    I think what you have has the potential of being iconic. The only concern I have
    about it is that the 'F' may read as an A so may need squaring up, in that case
    you would square up the 'L' too.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fdstil_5465.gif]\r\n\r\n(By
    the way, the second one is just the first one with sharp corners rounded.)\r\n\r\nThe
    one remaining reservation I have is that the letters are perhaps too heavy to
    adequately represent the industry that you are in which is altogether more refined!
    (This mark could easily be an engineering firm.)\r\n\r\nInteresting challenge
    you've got there."

  body: "Its a shame what these so called \"professionals\" came up for you.\r\n\r\nIf
    you go for a more classical look, it wont match your website design. It will match
    your products, but not your website. You will probably need to change it...I just
    don't see any kind of formal/classical design at the top of this website. Right
    now I can imagine the logo set in something like Bank gothic or Agency.\r\n\r\nI
    like Nick's take on this, its fits your market better, as well as your current
    web design, without a complete rebranding. I agree with frode, any graphic designer/typographer
    on this forum will happily accept the job and will do an amazing job for you...So
    I would suggest you do hire a professional, a REAL professional, to do your rebranding.\r\n\r\njeo324."

    Maybe one of those possible logos would be a good way to progress it even further?
    Many eyes see more. Maybe your judgement of a good logo is somehow distorted by
    the idea you have in your head, but you got something better already. It happens
    sometimes with clients that have something very specific in their mind but don't
    realize that that idea's not a really good/usable one."
