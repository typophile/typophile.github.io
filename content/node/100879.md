  will download and read online, no printing involved here. I am having some second
  thoughts on deciding between Lyon Text and Plantin. Both are quite beautiful fonts.
  Which do you think is better for reading on an online PDF?\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nS"

    might also want to double-check their EULAs to see which allows what kind of embedding.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I\u2019m working with Lyon in a biggish project right now (print and web,
    text and display, various media etc), and it\u2019s been fabulous to work with.
    I don\u2019t know if this is relevant for your case, but one big asset of Lyon
    is that it has both a Text and a Display variant \u2013 the latter looks great
    in headlines (especially in the Italics with activated swashes); I\u2019d say
    while Plantin is a very good design too, Lyon arguably has a greater range. Good
    range of weights too. I love Plantin, but Lyon is fresher. (And really, it isn\u2019t
    all that expensive.)\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to say more without knowing more about
    your content and context. Check that both typefaces have all the characters you
    need, and yes, like Hrant says, check the EULAs."

  body: "Indeed both fonts are quite nice. Other fonts i was considering were:\r\n\r\nMiller\r\nMercury\r\nSabon
    (maybe)\r\n\r\nis is true that Lyon is a bit on the more expensive side than Plantin.
    I really like Plantin since MONOCLE Magazine but there is extremly good use of
    Lyon in various magazine.\r\n\r\nCould it be possible not to allow embedding in
    a PDF?\r\n\r\n"

    Lyon, Plantin or Mercury?\r\n\r\nI thought of Gotham, Whitney and Verlag. By i
    view that last two (Whitney and Verlag) not as timeless as the first one. What
    do you think? Any other idea?\r\n\r\n"

    (ascenders are roughly level with cap height, W is crossed, it is a bit too wide

    some more, I think it is better for online viewing than Lyon but worse for print.\r\n\r\nLyon,

  body: Why have you been advocating for a terminal-less "a"? I know DTL documenta,
    Elena, Sina Nova, Cala, and even the lost Dove's type have no terminals on "a",
    but there are lots of typefaces (especially transitionals and venetians) that
    do well with a terminal.

  body: "Because the \"weak\" top helps readability (by forming more distinctive boumas).\r\n\r\nMany
    fonts have that feature because it's more calligraphic. Many others have it because
    they think it's pretty. I'm pretty sure very few have it mainly because they think
    it helps reading (Ernestine might be one of them). But my own Patria is neither
    chirographic nor a slave to style.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Thanks for your comment. I am aware of studies on readability and legibility
    (different issues, I know) for type based on ascender and descender lengths, variation
    in stroke width, x-height, etc, but was not aware of anything pro or con for the
    shape of the letter "a". Your Patria regular is a nice looking font.

  body: "Regarding some of your choices: there is  a major difference in x-height
    between them. Personally, I think a bit bigger x-height works best for on line
    viewing but is less elegant for printed output. Leaving out descenders and just
    comparing the height of \"x\" to \"H\" as measured in Illustrator, here are some
    ratios:\r\nBembo Book: 64%\r\nSabon: 64%\r\nStorm Baskerville 10: 65%\r\nSina
    Nova: 65%\r\nPlantin: 66%\r\nWhitman: 66%\r\nAdobe Garamond PP: 67%\r\nTrinite
    No2: 67%\r\nCalisto 67%\r\nDante: 68%\r\nAdobe Minion Pro: 68%\r\nMiller: 68%\r\nDocumenta
    69%\r\nIowan OS 69%\r\nScala: 69%\r\nAlbertina: 69%\r\nElena: 70%\r\nMercury:
    71%\r\nLyon: 71%\r\n\r\nIt is just one factor to consider, but you can see that
    Plantin has a lot smaller x-height than the others you've mentioned."

  body: "<blockquote>comparing the height of \"x\" to \"H\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBut
    that isn't a good reference (especially these days) since cap height varies a
    lot, without affecting the end-result much. You should really factor in the ascender
    height instead of the cap height.\r\n\r\nHmmm, where's that long, involved discussion
    we once had about that?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The height of \"x\" to \"l\" is also at the high end for Lyon and Elena,
    but apparantly it is for Plantin as well. A rough order based on x/l height:\r\nBembo
    book: 54%\r\nSina Nova: 58%\r\nGaramond PP: 60%\r\nMercury: 60%\r\nBaskerville
    10: 61%\r\nLyon: 63%\r\nElena: 63%\r\nPlantin: 64%\r\n\r\nHowever, Plantin looks
    smaller and is harder to read due to its overall character widths. (which TNR
    reduced substantially). I think some reduction in character width, so long as
    it is not too severe, helps with online reading. Newspaper type fonts are reasonably
    good for online viewing. Since the original poster was not planning to print the
    newsletter, a larger x height might be good."
