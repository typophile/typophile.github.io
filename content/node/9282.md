  body: Jill, the best thing you could do is crop that image down to 25 characters
    and try your luck at MyFonts with their What The Font engine.  <BR> <BR>The problem
    with your request is in the implied &#40;or assumed&#41; wish for a typeface with
    the same level of style and quality but without the price-tag. Thus the response
    from my fellow short cap. :^D Sadder still is the fact that the other fonts I
    might suggest are also from House. :^o But, I&#39;m pretty sure if you use What
    The Font you&#39;ll get a few similar choices.

    It&#39;s a bit bolder but similarly jaunty. $35 isn&#39;t too steep. <BR> <BR>Or
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/galapagos/beatnik/" target="_blank">Beatnik</a>,

  body: House&#39;s prices really aren&#39;t bad when you consider what you get -
    5 fonts, icons, plus the  ready-to-display Ed statuette for $160. But if you need
    only the one font it&#39;s rough. <BR> <BR>Their fonts are also really complete,
    with ligatures, alternate characters, etc. More bang for the buck.

  body: Interesting to see Pixie being sold commercially, I was only ever aware of
    the <a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/rakowski/dr4/davy_f4.htm">old
    shareware version</a>, which is very rough. I wonder if the <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?sku=IN20079">for-sale
    version</a> is any cleaner, it&#39;s hard to tell from the sample. There&#39;s
    also a commercial font called <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?sku=PN10131">Heatwave</a>
    which looks like a condensed version of the same design.

    <BR>Jill seems to have taken it all in good humor.
