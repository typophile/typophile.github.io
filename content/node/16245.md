    who has requested that his book be set in a 'new' typeface,  something made since
    1980; for his last book, he used a face from a young dutch designer, and now is
    interested in working with an american typographer's work. \r\n\r\nthe 'best'
    is, of course, a matter of taste, but i was thinking someone on the level on hoefler\r\n\r\nand,
    yes, it needs to be a type-designer, not a type-user"

    This could be done with any period of time; in fact, I bet even if you narrow

    be a pretty wide spectrum for you to pick from.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> <em>who, in your opinion, is the best living american typographer</em>\r\n\r\nO.K.
    At first I fell for this, and started thinking of candidates.\r\n\r\n> <em>i am
    working on a client who has requested that his book be set in a \u2018new\u2019
    typeface, something made since 1980</em>\r\n\r\nDid he give you a reason why?
    Is it related to the content of his book? Does he have a \"thing\" for type or
    for type designers? And why does this designer HAVE to be living? There have been
    excellent designers who have passed on since the 80s. Are their designs elimated
    just because they are dead?\r\n\r\n> <em>for his last book, he used a face from
    a young dutch designer</em>\r\n\r\nI'm curious who. Can you tell us who?\r\n\r\n>
    <em>now is interested in working with an american typographer\u2019s work. </em>\r\n\r\nAgain,
    what relevance does this have? Why the \"best\" designer? Why not the \"best\"
    typeface. Many of the great designers have also created a doggie doo face or two.
    Selecting the \"best\" living type designer will not necessarily get you the \"best\"
    or most relevant typeface for his book.\r\n\r\nAlso, using the \"best\" designer's
    \"best\" typeface is not going to make his book a \"best\" seller. Plus, it's
    not JUST the selection of type, it's HOW the type is used, and WHY it integrates
    with the design of the book.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, it's the right type for the
    right job.\r\nAnd any \"great\" designer or typographer who is not conceited will
    tell you that.\r\n\r\n"
