body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI made a fontfamily, and I finished kerning, so I started making
  a font specimen. I noticed that indesign didn't kern T/h.smcp, and all other glyphs
  in the kerning class of h.smcp (b.smcp, d.smcp, e.smcp, etc) when placed after T.
  The problem was only in the light, and after some checks, seemed to be only in this
  specific part of the font. Then inDesign crashed. I opened it again, and now the
  problem had spread to LightItalic as well. And it crashed. I let inDesign be since
  it crashed again, and started doing checks in Textedit. By then, the problem had
  spread to all styles, and many different glyphs. Not sure how many. I attached some
  pics, of what it looks like in TextEdit.\r\n\r\nI used FontFinagler to clean my
  cache, rebooted multiple times, and reinstalled the fonts multiple times. Does anyone
  know what the problem might be? Many thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper
  de Waard\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Everything works perfect in Fontlab, and in TextEdit it looks as if it also
    works fine at smaller sizes, though that's hard to judge. The problem is not only
    in smallcaps, but also in T in combination with lowercase, or V in combination
    with lowercase. Sadly, I can't edit the original post, and I can't upload any
    picts here. Damn you typophile.

  body: In combination with lowercase (TaTbTcTd...), TextEdit simply ignores all 'grey'
    kerning values (the ones I didn't actually type in but are present because they
    are in a kerningclass). That still doesn't explain why it goes all crazy with
    smallcaps, though... This is serious headache stuff.

    though :)
