  show on CBS Television Network. I can't seem to find where to buy it. I've tried
  \"What the font\" and googled it pretty deeply, but not a trace of the word Kaczmarek
  is related to a font name as far as I can find. And of course I've been to most
  of the major on-line type foundries and they don't have it either. It has some very
  unique character shapes, like the angle on the ascenders. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Jon, not an ID, but:\r\nThis has a lot of interesting character traits, but
    it's also very sloppy in terms of curve quality (and this has probable implications
    like incomplete character set, poor onscreen rendering, etc.). Unless you actually
    like it for this \"fauve\" quality I might recommend finding a more polished font
    that has a comparable style; and if you go with it you might have to have it worked
    on to make it adequately usable for such a prestigious project.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
