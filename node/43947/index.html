The company is called Post Industrial (PI)

I tried combining it with the number π (3.1415...) in abstract ways.
Let me know what approach you like best and what I could improve. If you have any other good ideas, please tell me.

Cheers</div>

Why did they (or you) chose to focus on the mathematical symbol of "PI" ... I might be missing something, but I can't see the connection.

The initials of Post Industrial are P.I., hence the Greek letter &pi;.

Yes, B is certainly the strongest.  If Post Industrial did anything mathematical or industrial, or creative with technological applications, then &pi; would have especially apt associations.  Still, B is very nice.

keeping it simple might be difficult sometimes, what I'm still not too sure about is wether or not to work with a pictogram or mainly something typographic.

I'll try to do more B-ish ;)

Interesting, I preferred h as well, but it feels too much like a building company. Too massive, but then again, that could be good =/</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yeah I just think the associations with the PI symbol are irrelevant ... the fact the initials of the business name are PI isn't a focal point, it doesn't tell a story about what they do (and if it does ... it's probably the wrong story.)

		<div class="commentbody">I don't know if i should be ashamed or not to say that you're not off to a very good start. The type choices are fairly "system" based and don't give much character to the idea of the company nor play off the name in a figurative or metaphorical way.

Why is it called Post Industrial? Is this a real company or a student project?

I'm still very unclear as to what the company does? Provides small business solutions doesn't mean anything. What solutions does it provide? Accounting, design, manufacturing, rich media?

The name is interesting in that the rise of micro economies is in full force or the D.I.Y. movement as some would call it. What i mean is that the name could infer "being past mass consumerism" and you are a middle man that is bridging the gap between them. Though since we don't know what services you're offering it's hard to tell.

Steps-

1. Restate the purpose of the business and what services it specifically provides.
2. Research the competition to avoid cliches and well know your enemies
3. Research visual elements, styles that could be used in service of creating variation on the identities.
4. Find a hybrid of the above, put them togther and bring them back to the forum for a better, insightful critique.

I agree - tell the story of the company and from what you have said, the Pi association is purely coincidental and will only serve to confuse not enrich.

I would work on the concept from the ground up and back again. Think of who they sell to and what there clients are really buying with their service. Is it speed, peace of mind etc.
