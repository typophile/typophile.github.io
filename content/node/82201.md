  a series, and as I was offline at the time, she did [[http://i52.tinypic.com/241lcuo.png

  that time she couldn''t remember which one she''d used, and her program/computer
  was having weird things that meant she couldn''t browse through her fonts. She thinks
  it started with a "GN". '

  body: "I actually spent a lot of time looking at two freebie sites and MyFonts.com.
    This font was not at any of those. Chances are this may have originated at a Japanese
    font site and so may not have made it to the sites we would usually find.\r\n\r\nIn
    my opinion this is poorly drawn , although clean, lettering, done by someone unfamiliar
    with Latin lettering, but if you want this 'raw' look you can set a few sample
    words and scroll through thousands of hand-printed fonts until you find something
    with a similar feel. At least you can find something free, if you don't want lettering
    that was done by someone who knows how to do Latin lettering. My suggestion is
    to check the handwriting category at Abstractfonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
