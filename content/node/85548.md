body: "I have a couple of doubts that I never understand the true meaning of some.
  \r\nFor exemple:\r\n\r\nWhen some description about typefaces refer the feature:
  <em>optical sizes</em>, what the really difference from the types without this feature?
  \r\n\r\nA good hinting of a typeface, really give much more legibility on the screen,
  but what are the techniques for make a really good hinting typeface?\r\n\r\nThis
  are two questions that occupy my head for some long.\r\n\r\nI am most interested
  in knowing the answer to these questions, and the more detailed the better. \r\nif
  you lose your time to answer me, thanks a lot!\r\n"
