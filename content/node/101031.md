  body: "this has a better view of the font, you can see the lower case g is squiggly,
    the curves on the 'n' and 'm' is at an angle the 'e' is cut short on top so the
    lower part protrudes out more than the upper part of the font. i need help identifying
    this so i can make a faux cover for my digital design class. thank you\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/258253359851517611ARFRNq6hc_4001.jpg]"
