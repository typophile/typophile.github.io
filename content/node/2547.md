  <BR>Ran across some Baby Teeth usage and thought <BR>I remembered someone asking
  about it. <BR> <BR>the lettering on the Dylan poster came first and <BR>Glaser turned
  it into a complete typeface. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be curious to see any more of Glaser&#39;s
  PhotoLettering <BR>faces if anyone has access.&#92; <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if this was done for PhotoLettering, but it is by Glaser.
    The face was originaly  called Babyfat, it now exists digitally as <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/bustle.htm"
    target="_blank">&#34;Bustle,&#34;</a> &#40;made by Font Bank&#41;.

    one, then good on &#39;im. I&#39;ve always known this face as the uncredited <b>Fat
    Shadow</b> from Letraset. &#40;Here shown in a scan from my 1985 Letraset Product

    my Photo-Lettering resources list Milton Glaser as the designer of the following

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll see if I can scan in examples showing the multiple weights variations

  body: The Photo-Lettering&#39;s &#34;One Line Manual of Styles&#34; &#40;from 1971&#41;,
    besides the faces Grant mentioned, also lists Futura Stencil as being by Glaser,
    as well as confirm that Baby Fat is his too &#40;see image below&#41;. I never
    knew there was a lowercase to this, very interesting. My previous attribution
    was based on something I saw in a magazine &#40;the art director of &#34;Fader&#34;
    used Bustle for headlines, and in the colophon it was atributed to Glaser as its
    original designer&#41;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23552.gif"
    alt="babyfat"> <BR> <BR> <BR>While I was looking for the Photo Lettering book
    I came across these two faces from a sample book from Typographic Innovations
    Inc. They seem like derivatives of Babyfat to me. Note the different ampersand
    in Buxom &#40;which seems like a version of Babyfat Black&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23553.gif"

    the gems lurking in the fat photolettering collection. They are the only ones
    who can legaly do it at this point having bought the rights. There are some beauties
    in the books those scans were pulled from. <BR> <BR>Randy
