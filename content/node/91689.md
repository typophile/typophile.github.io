    these days Underworld = Hell for most people.\r\nI'm guessing Hades was yet another
    victim of Christianity's\r\npropensity for \"repurposing\" pre-existing pagan
    beliefs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    have to go out of may to find one for this font.

    :-)\r\n\r\n@Hrant: I think \"Underworld\" and \"hell\" are not the same thing,
    no matter the culture or place. The infernal world is something different from
    hell. Don\u2019t know about \u201Cchristianity\u201D as a generic cultural term,
    but that association \u2013 as much as it may have been done \u2013 is wrong,
    and hell, in catholic theology, is not a place."

  body: "Hades was the guardian of the afterlife, which included the Greek concepts
    equivalent to both heaven <em>and</em> hell.  He was no more evil than, say, Zeus
    (and in fact was one of the more sober and respectable Greek gods).  The guy always
    seems to <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades\">get
    a bad rap nowadays</a>, though.\r\n\r\nNice font, BTW, thanks.  I will point out
    that your online catalogue isn't terribly useful for people on platforms/browsers
    which lack webfont support.  At least you do provide PDF samples, which is nice."

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!\r\nI didn't care that much about the
    meaning of the name, to be honest.\r\nI just felt the need of a font name started
    by the letter H :-)\r\nRegarding the name itself, it reminded me some poetry (Poe,
    Byron, Baudelaire) that I used to read, like the \"Don Juan in Hades\", and that's
    it! I never wanted the font to be connected to some sort of evil stuff.\r\nI think
    it's a pleasant font, inspired by the lettering in a beer house that I saw in
    Malmo in 2007.\r\nIt was made just for fun, no profit in the horizon!\r\n\r\nAll
    the best to my fellow typophiles. Have a wonderful 2013!\r\n\r\nDino"
