  to bring it up again but i've just been doing some Steven Heller research on his
  writings on the swastika and blackletter ('Swastika chic' 'designing hate' and 'Hitler's
  children: Nazi iconography in contemporary design') and i'd like to know if anyone
  knows of any resources; books or online that provide an opposing view.\r\n\r\nI'm
  also looking into the possibility of blackletter becoming fashionable due to a decorative
  revival, if anyone knows of any resources or has any opinions then i'd love to hear
  them.\r\n\r\nThankyou."

      in an 'anti' kind of a way, but when i had a look at the gwen stefani website
      it's actually (loosely) based on an illuminated manuscript.  I'm not sure if
      i like it but it's nice to see someone do something slightly more positive than
      the snoop dog treatment that it usually gets.\r\n\r\n<a>http://www.gwenstefani.com<a>"

    nice thing about this article is that it gives me an idea of how the swastika
    could embark on the (long) road to redemption: we could simply start calling the
    Nazi one Hakenkreuz. :-)  I suspect we might be surprised how much of a difference
    a new name/distinction could make.\r\n\r\nBTW, some nearly-useless trivia: Stefani

    the name is sort of a lost cause. That would require explaining the root of the

    that lecture most people have stopped listening. Better to just let sleeping dogs
    lie and stick with the thousands upon thousands of symbols that aren't verboten
    in the Europe and North America."

  body: "I think the decorative revival theory is valid. Practically all of my ambigram
    clients want blackletter. They don't know what it's called, but they describe
    it as \"fancy\" and \"sophisticated\". I know this is in part because they think
    ambigrams have to look like the ones in Angels & Demons, but more importantly,
    I think they see <em>value</em>, and therefore <em>class</em>, in the decorative
    appearance of blackletter.\r\n\r\nI think this accounts for the rapper usage too.
    Look at street culture's \"bling\" fixation. My guess is that their intention
    is not so much to choose an \"evil-looking\" font to look badass, but to choose
    a \"fancy\" font to indicate their wealth, just like all the gold chains, Cadillacs,
    and those flamboyant pimp clothes."

    can work. Partly from my own experience (with \"bouma\" and \"notan\") my impression
    is that you can make quite a lot of headway -even all the way into the mainstream-
    simply by bullishly using a new term (especially if it's not really totally new)
    but spending a good deal of time explaining. Here's what I think would be a typical
    exchange:\r\n\r\nYou: The Nazis ... blah blah blah ... using the Hakenkreuz to
    ... blah blah blah.\r\nLayman: What's a Hakenkreuz?\r\nYou: It's the Nazi version
    of the swastika.\r\nLayman, version 1: Huh.\r\n\r\nLayman, version 2: Why not
    just call it a swastika?\r\nYou version 1: A few reasons. One is that the swastika
    was actually an ancient symbol for <cite>good</cite> in many cultures, and we
    should try to clarify the difference. It's just good terminological practice.
    (Optional: And we should try to fix every single thing the Nazis ruined.)\r\n\r\nLayman,
    version 1: You're trying to minimize the Holocaust aren't you?!\r\nYou: NEXT!\r\n\r\nLayman,
    version 2: Huh.\r\nYou: Tell you what, let me show you some fraktur type...\r\nLayman:
    Huh?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    before, and it usually seems to end up with people realizing that Nazi use of
    Blackletter failed to make it taboo in the way it did the swastika. As someone
    else pointed out to me in a previous thread, the anti-defamation league and similar
    groups have not objected to Blackletter, so I think it\u2019s safe to say the

    try to bother. At the very least, even as a layman, I would be -and in fact am-
    opposed to the continued demonization of the swastika to the point of preventing
    uninvolved cultures from using it. What I'm getting at is that things like this
