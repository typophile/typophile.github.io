  years ago. Grew tired to be fair and here I am once again.\r\nHere I was thinking
  in doing some stuff once again and found myself with a question.\r\nAren't there
  are already too many type faces? Is there any space for new ones? New foundries?
  Is it still profitable enough to live without eating rice and tuna everyday?\r\nWhat
  is your opinion on these subjects?"

    in any other creative or practical discipline for someone to think it reasonable
    to stroll in and say "Why don't you just stop having ideas and creating new things.
    There's enough now." When a field is saturated with competition, all that means
    is that success requires being particularly good and original.

    body: By all means, don't think that my question was that negative. It was more
      of a rhetoric question. To open a discussion regarding the actual state of the
      business in typography and ways to solve the saturation, paths to take. It is
      a creative discipline, true but also is design and there is still space for
      designers. Is there for typographers? (once again, kind of rhetoric question)

    is hardly a sure-fire way of getting rich.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with some
    talent, enough perseverance, the right timing, a little marketing and some luck
    thrown in for good measure, there's still a descent possibility of coming up with
    something new that people will like, buy and use. Besides, it sort of fun \u2014
    especially when a font is released and you start seeing it around in unexpected
    locations."

    is impossible, even for industry specialists such as Stephen Coles, to be aware
    of every typeface published.\r\n\r\nBut I wouldn\u2019t say that this expansion
    of products is the same thing as saturation. The market is homeostatic, and it
    is not saturated as long as foundries keep on releasing new designs!\r\n\r\n"

      Easier to market yourself. Not undervaluing your work. We spoke in the past
      and your work is awesome. For a beginner, isn't it really saturated? What is
      really a new good and interesting design nowadays? Could you give some examples?\r\n\r\nOnce
      again, see my replies only as a devil's advocate. Farming the discussion :P\r\n\r\nBy

  body: "The number of opportunities available in type design is greater than ever
    before. So is the number of people pursuing it, mind you. I'm not sure the percentage
    of people who are successful is higher, but the numbers are.\r\n75 years ago,
    you pretty much had to work for a type foundry and mostly the only way in was
    through apprenticeship.\r\n\r\n35 years ago, you mostly had to work for a typesetting
    machine manufacturer, and again apprenticeship was important. There were no schools
    teaching type design as a full program.\r\n\r\n15 years ago, it was difficult
    to break into the field without being at a foundry, but at least there were again
    a number of them. Starting your own foundry or working with an existing foundry
    as an independent was an option, at last. There were a couple of schools starting
    to offer degrees in type design.\r\n\r\nToday, you can be your own foundry or
    distribute through a reseller, and anybody with a computer can learn type design.
    There are a variety of degree programs and shorter courses available from schools
    that have really developed polished curricula. The number of people making a go
    of it as type designers is almost certainly vastly greater than at any previous
    point in history.\r\n\r\nThere are problems, to be sure. But in many respects
    it is a golden age of type design. I feel lucky to be part of it."

  body: "<blockquote>For a beginner, isn't it really saturated? What is really a new
    good and interesting design nowadays? Could you give some examples?</blockquote>\r\nHow
    do your own skills have any influence on whether or not the market is saturated?
    It's not a matter of opinions. The market simply isn't saturated. It may seem
    that way because there are a lot of typefaces in the same style being released,
    which may give the impression that there is no innovation taking place. But even
    within certain styles, I constantly see innovation. Not every typeface is original,
    but at least once a month a typeface is released that fills a small gap, and at
    least once a year a typeface is released which makes me think \"Damn, that's brilliant.
    If only I had thought of that\". The principle of multi-layered typefaces is also
    a new one, of which we've only just started to explore the possibilities. As technology
    improves, the possibilities will increase as well.\r\n\r\nOne could only speak
    of a saturated market if there is an end goal or if it's an isolated market which
    doesn't change over time. However, no one knows how typefaces and language will
    change over time, so it seems ludicrous to suggest not only that we have all the
    typefaces we need, but also that innovation isn't necessary. How do you reckon
    it will work if the world keeps changing but there are no more typefaces being
    made?\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems you suggested there are enough typefaces based on
    style. I think there aren't enough, and I feel several of my typefaces do fill
    small gaps in the market, and I have plenty more ideas. But also note that a lot
    of type innovations are more or less invisible \u2014 particularly so for the
    layman.\r\n\r\nOne great example of \"invisible\" innovation is the introduction
    of specific formats for use of typefaces on the web. I'm calling this invisible
    because on blogs you will see a lot of newly released typefaces and as such you
    will get insight into the styles, but you won't get insights into various other
    aspects of the market. As such, you may get the crazy idea that because you see
    the same styles over and over (which might have a lot to do with the selection
    process of the blogs as well, as not every blog owner will be equally knowledgeable
    about type) the market is saturated, while in fact behind the scenes there is
    A LOT going on. A few years ago typefaces became available for use online, and
    so now everyone is upgrading their fonts for use on the web. So even if there
    are no new styles coming out, it will take years to upgrade all the typefaces
    for use on the web. Also realize that a lot of typefaces lack extensive language
    support. There are so many languages and so few typefaces that support the majority
    of them. In upcoming years typefaces will likely become more elaborate, with a
    wider language support and more features. Lots of typefaces lack small-caps as
    well. Could the market be saturated when there is actually still so much missing
    from the typefaces currently available?\r\n\r\nAnd even if there is no truly original
    work coming out, currently a lot of major companies feel they should get a custom
    typeface which meets their exact requirements. So in that regard the market isn't
    saturated either. The world requires a lot of custom typefaces.\r\n\r\nAlso, type
    used to change over a time span of at least 50 years. It seems strange for a layman
    not to spot anything original in a few years and conclude the market is saturated.
    I know nowadays things change more rapidly, but it still takes some time for big
    innovations to occur. Besides, one could say we're consciously changing type slowly,
    because if you do it too fast it will have a very negative impact. People need
    time to get used to certain changes. I'm certainly seeing certain trends and changes
    in book typefaces in the last 20 years, so I suspect in another 20 years we will
    definitely have more insight into what characterizes our period. If after 20 years
    you look back and conclude type has stayed the same in 40 years, you might be
    able to say the market is saturated (or its designers have become stale). I can
    already see that this won't be the case. Besides, I have the feeling we're on
    the verge of dramatically changing the way we connect and communicate, the way
    we use the Internet, and the way typography is handled on the web. In time, typography
    on the web will be a lot closer to typography in print."
