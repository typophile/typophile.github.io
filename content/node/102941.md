  blueprint-like. Eric Olsen's Stratum is pretty close, but doesn't seem right for
  the job.\r\n\r\nI ran across this design from Pentagram and was wondering if anyone
  knew what they used:\r\n<img src=\"http://www.pentagram.com/en/ML%20029_ds-lo.jpg\">\r\n\r\nAny
  guesses? A link to purchase would be super helpful. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Pretty interesting. Politica looks pretty similar to Univers Condensed.
      What it's missing are those nice angled moments in the type (like in the 'A')
