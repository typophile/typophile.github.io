  capability) and I have a very particular font in mind. Since I couldn't find anything
  that looks like it, I took to the drawing board myself.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_5694.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
  is not suposed to be a typeface, which is why it looks so unbalanced. I am looking
  to find something similar, where the feel of the C is the most important to me...
  Can someone help me ID something similar (In terms of feel, not quality;-)\r\n\r\nAlternatively
  I might also finish these couple of letters only for this poster. If this is the
  case I will probably redraw them, so that they are no longer cursive. Also the width
  of the letters seems to get smaller gradually, which is obviously not what I want..."

    simply redraw my sketches so that they look a bit... well, acceptable.\r\n\r\nOne
    more question: If I were to actually make a font, how would I start. Is there
    some free software for the mac that allows you to draw and compile all the glyphs.
    (I heard Illustrator is too sensitive...)\r\n\r\n(I know that there must be tons
    of websites on this subject matter, but I would like to hear from some people
    who have already taken on the same challenge. Also, I am lazy;-)"
