  <BR> <BR>The closest What The Font comes up with is Solpera by Storm, but that certainly
  ain&#39;t it. It&#39;s not used anywhere else in the booklet, so it could be custom
  drawn.

  body: The font is from Handcrafted Fonts &#40;now called JM Fonts&#41; and is called
    <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=415551" target="_blank">Exposition</a>.
    It&#39;s by Jonathan Macagba, although Fonts.com doesn&#39;t mention the designer.
    I know this one because I use it in my Bowfin Printworks logo,and it was one of
    the earliest fonts in my collection. There are a Plain One &amp; Two and a Rounded
    version. This is one of the Plain versions. Also available at Veer.com in the
    Umbrella collection.

  body: Thanks Mike, it&#39;s fun to start getting back in the flow here. I am almost
    caught up on everything, except for getting back in the right sleep routine.
