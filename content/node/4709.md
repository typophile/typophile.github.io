body: Dear all, I look for informations on the designers &#40;contemporary or old&#41;
  which already have worked for watch companies. I know for example that Adrian Frutiger
  had drawn in 2002 a dial for Ventura Swiss. All information on this subject are
  welcome. I thank you by advance for your help.
