    body: I do not agree on that one....Blackletter was and is about more than just
      the handwriting of scribes, it is partly about decoration "for the sake of decoration",
      a concept that simply is not in the Bradly Hand typeface. There is some debate
      on the reasons behind the decoration of Blackleter, but even with that, the
      decoration for the sake of decoration is still there no matter what the reasons
      for it.

  body: "Come to think of it, one of the properties of blackletter was that it was
    used for printing texts in the vernacular, while Roman was used for texts in Latin.\r\n\r\nToday,
    if different languages still use the Roman alphabet, usually the same typeface
    is used for both. But occasionally sans-serif typefaces are used for foreign languages
    just slightly more often than for English... thus, Pinyin in some dictionaries
    is in a particular sans-serif face; Univers is associated with continental Europe.\r\n\r\nSo
    perhaps Roman is the new blackletter, if anything.\r\n\r\nIf not, there's always
    Optima or Lydian... or even Radiant. (Or should I try to defend the notion that
    its cousin, Peignot Bold, is the \"new blackletter\" for our time?)"

  body: "Ryan, I'm sorry but you really do not know what you are talking about, and
    you are using terms without understanding their conventional and specialist meanings,
    or the context of their origins. What characterises the various blackletter styles
    are their modes of letter construction, and since all originated as formal bookhands
    to suggest that blackletter is by nature 'partly about decoration \"for the sake
    of decoration\"' is simply not true. Decorative blackletter styles are mostly
    later developments, notably products of Victorian signpainting and engraving,
    ergo 'Old English'.\r\n\r\n<em>Should I change the name of the thread to 'Compacta
    is today's Textura'?</em>\r\n\r\nThis, at least, is a good question, because it
    enables one to see the basic problem with your whole approach. Ask yourself, what
    distinguishes textura from other forms of blackletter? It isn't particularly the
    weight or the horizontal compression, because those can be found in other blackletter
    styles too. Rather, what enables one to look at a sample of writing or type and
    classify it as textura is the <em>construction</em> of the letters, what a scribe
    (hi, Michael) will call the ductus. So you can only suggest that Compacta and
    similar styles are 'today's Textura' if by this you mean only 'Compacta is today's
    heavy and narrow style of type' and that as such it is a kind of parallel to earlier
    heavy and narrow styles of type, of which you have chosen textura as an example.
    To what degree is the second part of this true? Is there a parallel? I don't really
    think so, at least not in general typographic terms, because I don't see much
    of a similarity in the way types like Compacta are <em>used</em>. Remember, textura
    was, as the name suggests, a text face, whereas Compacta is a display face. I
    think Michael is closer with his jest that Compacta is the new Old English, since
    if there were a parallel it would be in display lettering, and we're back to those
    Victorian signpainters who wanted heavy for impact and narrow for fit."

  body: "@etachen:\r\n<cite>maybe this can be today's blackletter</cite>\r\n\r\nWhile
    Adso is an interesting <em>contemporary</em> blackletter, there is a world of
    difference between that and something that can be called \"today's blackletter\".\r\n\r\nThe
    latter may not be typographically related to blackletter at all; \"today's blackletter\"
    is something that fulfills the function today that blackletter fulfilled yesterday.\r\n\r\nWhich
    means that \"today's blackletter\" varies depending on the value of yesterday
    that you use.\r\n\r\nFor the most distant value of yesterday, when blackletter
    was the generally used style of type, <em>roman</em> is today's blackletter.\r\n\r\nFor
    a more recent value, when blackletter was the more archaic style of type, still
    often used, in nearly all the Latin alphabet area, I would tend to say that <em>Scotch
    Roman</em> is, if not today's blackletter, the blackletter of the early twentieth
    century - after Caslon and Baskerville had been revived.\r\n\r\nFor a still more
    recent value of yesterday, when blackletter in the form of Fraktur was the distinctive
    typeface of Germany, today's blackletter might be Univers or Helvetica or Aldus
    (Palatina Book, in effect).\r\n\r\nThese examples, two of which I had already
    mentioned in this thread, show why I reject the idea of Compacta getting the title...
    if one thinks of the use of blackletter as a display font used for its boldness,
    then one might go with Clarendon or Bodoni (not really a valid choice, as it was
    used together with blackletter, but for a different display function, in newspapers)...
    the use of Compacta for this function doesn't seem to me to have any parallels
    to the limited use of blackletter for that purpose.\r\n\r\nEDIT: But given the
    idea that Compacta is being used as an almost-unreadably narrow face, replacing
    blackletter for that purpose, only the lack of lowercase when it is also used
    for that purpose stands between <strong>French Clarendon</strong> and the designation
    of \"today's blackletter\"!\r\n\r\nAh: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/playbill/|Playbill]]
    is perhaps \"today's blackletter\" in <em>that</em> sense!"
