<p>Font Lab studio is more expensive but seems to be the buzz. what does it do that Fontographer doesnt?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you want to draw some glyphs but do not need every possible advanced feature, get TypeTool. It is is inexpensive and you will be able to draw a complete typeface. If you want the challenge of a more complex and sophisticated interface with every feature, get FontLab.</p>
<p>The problem with Fontographer is that while it seems like a nice middle ground, it is rarely updated. The last update was in 2006 so it&rsquo;s obsolete in software terms, and it will not import or export the Open Type file format unless you purchase FogLamp for an additional $79. In my opinion, the ability to work with OTF files in today&rsquo;s world is critical. TypeTool gives you this functionality for $99. Also worth mentioning is that if you use a PC, Fontographer has established problems with operating systems 2000 and on. Don&rsquo;t get Fontographer.</p>
<p>You asked what does FontLab Studio have that Fontographer does not. The short answer is: a lot of &ldquo;behind the scenes stuff&rdquo; that matters to professional typographers but does not matter much to casual hobbyists and beginners. It is truly too much to explain in one breath if you are first starting out. Run some Google searches (FontLab Studio 5 versus Fontographer) to find some specifics and read FontLab&rsquo;s website for more information on the differences.</p>
<p>From what you wrote above, I would purchase TypeTool if I were you. FontLab Studio will be too much software for you. Just because TypeTool is inexpensive does not mean it is a poor piece of software lacking in features you will need.</p>
<p>If you enjoy drawing letters on paper and wish to &ldquo;vectorize&rdquo; those drawings you may also wish to consider ScanFont ($99 also from FontLab). This means you would have two programs: TypeTool and ScanFont.</p>

<p>Yes, TypeTool will help you turn beziers drawn in Illustrator into fonts and it has a Metrics and Kerning window which is what you mean when you talk about seeing how the letters work together. Once you become comfortable with the interface, you will probably draw your glyphs directly in TypeTool.</p>

<p>All font editors do that. It&rsquo;s usually called a &ldquo;metrics&rdquo; window. Font Tool does all the basic stuff&ndash;drawing, spacing, kerning, generating fonts. FontLab Studio adds more advanced features that professional font developers need. It&rsquo;s like the difference between Photoshop Elements and Photoshop. Or between a scooter and a motorcycle.</p>

<p>Fontforge is less stable than Fontlab (at least on OS X) and has a similarly overcomplicated interface due to being one app with way too many functions. And it’s an old-school X app, so it looks pretty gross, which is pretty off putting for a design tool that needs to be used for hours at a time. I’ve tried switching a few times and always went back to Flab.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are many people for whom FontForge is not the right tool; it&rsquo;s not for the faint of heart or for those who require an aesthetically pleasing work environment (the same might be said for Linux in general&hellip;), and it does like to crash on occasion (although there&rsquo;s rarely any data loss, as it backs up your work regularly).  The author warns that it should be considered perpetual beta software which will probably never see a stable release.  But if you&rsquo;re already using Linux and are willing to put up with the somewhat steep learning curve and the ugly-as-sin, overcomplicated interface, it may be the right tool for you.</p>
<p>FontForge and Inkscape can be a particularly nice combination, since FontForge can import SVG images directly.  FontForge is also the only tool I know of with support for Raph Levien&rsquo;s Spiro (I generally find Bézier curves easier, but the point is that in FontForge both are available, assuming you&rsquo;ve installed Spiro).  Another area where FontForge outshines the competition is combining diacritical marks; after an initial setup, adding anchors to base glyphs and diacritics is as easy as adding any other point.</p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s not out of the question to begin your font development in, say, TypeTool, then use FontForge to add more advanced features.  This workflow won&rsquo;t appeal to most people, but it&rsquo;s available nonetheless.</p>
