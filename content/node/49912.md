body: "Hi,\r\nApologies if this has been answered before...I couldn't find anything
  with a quick Google here. \r\n\r\nI'm designing Thai characters for my font and
  wanted to know if there are any resources out there that deal specifically with
  Thai letters and type design.\r\n\r\nI have found the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/overview.aspx|Microsoft
  Character Design Standards]] pretty useful and wonder if there is any similar thing
  for Thai letters? \r\n\r\nI also need information about how to get the tone marks
  and vowels to position correctly around the consonants...I'm assuming it's to do
  with long opentype scripts? Is there a beginner's guide or is it inherently complex?!\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any suggestions :)"

    to be used for a Simth-Corona typewriter keyboard in Thailand, I researched Thai
    characters in non-computer related books about this interesting language.\r\n\r\nIn
    those days, Unicode did not exist. Today, much information about Thai is available
    in the official Unicode 5.0 book from Addison Wesley (is there Unicode 6.0? yet).
    See page 373-376 and page 657-639.\r\n\r\nThai is a fascinationing language as
    the forms of certain letters change depending upon its context in a word.\r\n\r\nThe
    OpenType font format addresses this requirement with its CSUB routine. Correctly
    applied, a 'smart' OpenType Thai font can produce Thai text in a way that was
    not possible in the computer-based typesetting until now."
