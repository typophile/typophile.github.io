  body: "Handlettered \u2013 look at the repeating letterforms (l in Dunlop versus
    in Charles; counters of the e's). I'd say it's a strange vernacular script taking
    up forms of Textura (r, c, e, o) and Roman skeletons (W, D, C, G, s). \r\nIf you
    need to reproduce something alike, you might be looking for old Bastarda and Fraktur
    type, but also at Art Nouveau lettering (around 1910-30). "

  body: "Seems to be a brass or bronze plate of unknown date in the Medieval Revival
    style popular in the late 19th century. The inscription is in an English vernacular
    lettering pattern that mixes a Gothic [Textura] lowercase with Roman capitals.
    \ \r\nThere would not have been a font as such. \r\nIf you want a font with something
    of the flavor of the lettering you could try David Quay's <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/blackmoor/\">Blackmoor</a>,
    which mixes a gothic lowercase with Lombardic capitals. \r\nFor an overview of
    digitized Textura fonts see <a href=\"http://www.fontscape.com/explore?755\">Textura</a>.\r\nSome
    of the lower cases are closer to your image than others. None of the upper cases
    match.\r\nA vast number of Textura fonts were made since Gutenberg. Only a small
    percentage are digitized.\r\nDon"
