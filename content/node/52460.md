    of God\",[1] Hebrew: \u05D1\u05B5\u05BC\u05D9\u05EA \u05D0\u05B5\u05DC\u200E,
    also transliterated Beth El or Beth-El) was a border city described in the Old
    Testament . . . A second biblical Bethel, in the southern Judah, is mentioned
    in Joshua (8:17 and 12:16), and seems to be the same as Bethul or Bethuel, a city
    of the tribe of Simeon.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Life photos for Bethel was Bethel,
    NY, and Woodstock, photographed by Bill Eppridge. So I went ahead for a hefty,
    landscape, coffeetable monograph.\r\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of psychedelia when
    it comes to design/art and purposely stayed away from all that as we're coming
    up on 2009, yet I didn't want it to be TOO modern. I also just wanted to keep
    it subtle and sophisticated in hoping to match the muted feel of the photographs.
    Poplar seemed to match the ever-so-slight softness of the film as well. But you
    don't care about all that, do ya?. I'll shut up.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bookmeme_4750.jpg]"

  body: "I'll be honest...the Wikipedia hit was for an album by Life of Agony (whom
    and of whom I've never heard) called \"Ugly,\" but I just put \"Ugly\" into the
    Life search...so yeah. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uglybook_4529.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    image just immediately leaped out at me from the search results for some reason.
    Apparently, there's a model agency in London called \"Ugly\" or something like
    that...\r\n\r\nIs it sad that I'm considering using this title, at least, if I
    ever release a book of my poetry? \r\n\r\nP.S. Please don't think that I consider
    any of the fonts here \"ugly.\" I actually like them all, and I love using two
    out of the three families represented. I just think they worked, sort of offsetting
    the deliberately \"silk-screened\" image. \r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT\r\n\r\nEDIT: Since
    it seems to be the hip, cool thing to name your typefaces: \r\nVirgin, Adobe Caslon

    very popular and the database is getting hit really hard with all the content,

    is not just typography, but also a good sense of composition and colour. \r\n\r\nLike
    Carnival Splendor by Bendy, Artificial Imagination by cdn, Observational Error
    by Glitch, Kirribilli by Dantho... I just don't know where to start. Do these
    people acually practise as designers? You can make old fashionied or conservative
    design but some things are just plain wrong. The type is just slapped on top of
    the images with absolutely no sensitivity. Something like this discredits you
    to actually say anything about typography. Unfortunately it's only a reflection
    of the visual cacophony that plagues any bookshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS I'm a long time

    of convenience. I haven't gone searching for the others yet. \r\n\r\nI happen
    to like EnergonCube's cover . I don't see it as \"slapping type over an image.\"
    While the overall design is clean, there's a lot of tension being created by the
    sinking, vertical type against the horizontal grain created by the wood planks.
    Add to that a good use of scale. Overall, EnergonCube has achieved a good sense
    of foreboding. \r\n\r\nWhile it's not the best here, it certainly isn't the worst.
    Just because some of these covers don't agree with your personal taste, doesn't
    mean you have to slam them. You're entitled to your opinion. But, if you're going
    to offer critism, provide some constructive feedback. \r\n\r\n...Or post something
