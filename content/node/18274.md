  body: "This is one of the fonts from the old ClickArt Handwritten Fonts CD (now
    sold as part of the Broderbund ClickArt  Fonts 3 Deluxe Collection). This particular
    one is called 'Roel'. You can see it in my <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg15.html\">Script
    Font ID Guide, Part 11, page 15.</a> These fonts have been around since the mid-90's.
    I am very familiar with them because my own printing is one of the fonts in the
    set (Bowfin).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
