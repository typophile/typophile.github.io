body: "Hi SF Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm at the end of the development process for Beorcana,
  my calligraphic sans text and display family (see www.beorcana.com). The fonts,
  in OpenType, PostScript and TrueType, should be available at www.fonts.com sometime
  near the end of October. Meanwhile I'm preparing to celebrate. Won't you join me?
  <!--break-->\r\n\r\nSunday October 8 I've got a beautiful space reserved for the
  afternoon/evening, and will have a keepsake type specimen poster available to guests,
  as well as refreshments and music. This event is co-hosted by Richard Schwarzenberger,
  who will be celebrating the publication of his first book of fiction, which is also
  typeset in Beorcana. Copies of the book will also be available.\r\n\r\nIf you're
  interested in joining us, or if you're just interested in a small showing of the
  typeface, please contact me through the typophile contact form, give me your mailing
  address, and I'll send you an invitation/announcement. \r\n\r\nI'm very excited
  to finish this project and present it to you; It's been 14 years in the making.
  I hope you can attend. \r\n\r\nCarl"

    see a lot of distinguished use. The caps for one are a refreshing surprise, and
    the lc holds its lustre all the way to the darkest weight - no mean feat. Warm
    congrats, which I would actually be tempted to deliver in person during your event,
    except I'll be in Yerevan that weekend. Oh, and I hope we won't have to wait until
    2020 for your next tour de force!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Looking good, Carl. I did some calculations and came to the conclusion that
    a cab ride from here would be a bit too expensive. Anyway, have a ball! It seems
    I have to add a friend to Mundo in the list of typefaces that need to be bought
    from Carl Crossgrove.

  body: "Highlights (no pun intended) were a flaming orange sunset we saw reflected
    like beacons off windows all over the East Bay, followed by a gigantic, near-full
    moonrise and the appearance of lights all over SF and East Bay hills. During the
    day, someone must have enjoyed watching Blue Angels scream around over the various
    boats in the bay; I don't care for the Blue Angels myself. \r\n\r\nTwo of my sisters,
    several co-workers from Monotype, and several Bay Area typophiles came (among
    others), and there was a nice mix of literary, garden, swimming, foodie and type
    people in attendance. Turns out there were 4 new babies there, and I realized
    they were all my friend's babies (Delve and Jennifer brought flame-haired Donovan).
    We're getting them started early. ;)\r\n\r\nI don't have a lot of my own photos
    as my camera is useless in any light but full daylight, but if I get some from
    others I'll post them. I think Zara took some good moonrise shots. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    there will be more Bay Area type events.... "
