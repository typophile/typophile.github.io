body: Writing a paper, and need some insight to these questions. Ive already covered
  how Jenson influenced a myriad of other typefaces, so I am looking for other reasons
  it is signifcant today, and also where Jenson is being used today (magazines?).  Thanks!

  body: We saw Jenson on tv last night. I forget how it was being used. Also I think
    it is still a great typeface for fine letterpress printing. But it is true that
    it isn't as popular as it once was. Certainly there are many more beautiful serifs
    out there.

    A great and very legible typeface for fine offset printing. (Surprisingly the
    shape of the q does not seem to disturb the legibility, although I think it is
    larksome and not needed to vary from the \"normal\" shape of the q.)"

  body: "\"Jenson\" will always be significant, because it is the definitive roman
    type.\r\nA great many type designers do their version (mine is Goodchild/Nicholas),
    presumably because engaging the <em>fons et origo</em> provides insight into why
    the typographic letter is shaped the way it is. \r\nDo art directors and graphic
    designers feel similarly inclined? What has prompted you to use it (or similar
    Venetian), Tiffany?"

  body: "Not only is Jenson the root of our Latin type, it\u2019s the typeface used
    in the roots of great printed book design. Jenson\u2019s books were exquisite;
    his paper, proportion, and typesetting are simply fabulous. So as long as there
    are books, there will be book designers who have sought out Jenson\u2019s work
    and let it influence theirs."
