  after its initial release DTL OTMaster (OTM) was hailed as very practical stand-alone
  application for reviewing and editing tables of fonts with a SFNT \uFB01le structure.
  OTM\u2019s big advantage is that it allows editing of tables in a graphical user
  interface. As Dr. Ken Lunde, Sr. Computer Scientist at Adobe Systems, stated in
  2009: \u2018<em>As someone who works with OpenType fonts on an every-day basis,
  and with the tools that are used to build and check them, I would like to state
  here that DTL OTMaster is a fabulous tool. The best way for me to characterize it
  is that it gives me the power of some existing command-line tools, wrapped up in
  nice GUI. It handles CJK fonts well, including those with a large number of glyphs.
  I especially appreciate that there is a Mac OS X version.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nThe
  new OTM edition has version number 3.7, while the previous one was numbered \u20182.4\u2019.
  In the past two and a half years the functionality of OTM was enhanced and extended,
  hence the ascending numbering. The new edition is for that reason a major upgrade,
  containing a lot of new functionality. From the import/export of Ideographic Variation
  Sequences (IVS) to the editing of Feature Parameters, and from an autohinter for
  edited or newly added glyphs to support for COLR+CPAL tables.\r\n\r\nSome use OTM
  for font-spelunking, other use it Open(Type)-heart surgery. Some use it for compiling
  OpenType Layout features, applying the elegant automatic subsetting, others use
  it for mark positioning. OTM is the Swiss knife for CFF- and TTF-based OpenType,
  TrueType, and TTC (TrueType Collection) fonts.\r\n\r\nA listing of the new functionality
  in OTM 3.7 can be found <a href=\"http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/RM/Read_Me_lb.txt\">here</a>.
