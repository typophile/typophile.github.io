body: "Need some help with this font - I tried identifont, what the font, and fontshop
  but couldn't really find a font close enough to it.\r\n\r\nThings I was looking
  at were:\r\nThe angle on the \"e\" crossbar\r\nThe vertical spacing and the ascender/descender
  on some of the numerals\r\nThe shape of the numerals\r\nThe \"dips\" in the serifs
  - Especially noticebale in the \"B\", \"D\", and \"n\", \"i\", \"r\"\r\n\r\nI tried
  to give best example and left the resolution fairly high so you can see the elements
  I was looking at.\r\n\r\nSo any help would be great.\r\nThanks in advance...\r\n\r\nJon"

    Forum Titling (caps only)</a>. The figures and caps look like a match. Doesn\u2019t
    have a lowercase tho."

  body: Could be <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-kennerley/">Kennerley</a>,
    which is the textface to be combined with Forum for titling. Both by Goudy.

  body: I agree that my title was fairly non-descript but I was not exactly sure how
    to describe it. In anycase all the suggestions were awesome and got me on a good
    path - especially the Lanston font that Mike sampled is almost perfect. Thanks
    everyone for the help.
