body: "I'm in the process of getting a business idea in motion. I work with a very
  talented calligrapher. Eventually, I'd like to create an online site that would
  sell his fonts.\r\n\r\nInitially, in getting started, I'd like to run through the
  process of converting a scanned image to completed font. I'd like to get a feel
  for how much time will be invested into each face.\r\n\r\nThe focus is going to
  be hand-drawn type - this brings with it the implication that these fonts might
  carry a lot of edge texture with them. With this in mind, what is the best route
  to take? \r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to vectorize each letter form, but I've heard
  their might be issues if letterforms get too detailed. I don't think I want to go
  the bitmap route. Is there any rule of them for determining if a typeface is too
  detailed to vectorize?\r\n\r\nWhat program would be best for accomplishing this?
  Fontlab? Not sure what options exist? I own photoshop and illustrator, but I'm going
  to have to put some money out there for obtaining a font program.\r\n\r\nTo give
  some context to this project. I'm a graphic/web designer, been in the industry for
  10 years. The guy I am working with has been at it for over 40 years. He published
  and known in his niche. "

    question - the simple answer is get a copy of Logo Font and Lettering Bible by
    Leslie Cabarga - study it and then come back with any questions. FontLab or Fontographer
    is probably what you are going to need, and also ScanFont - all from FontLab.

    you might experiment by acquiring some fonts that have complex glyph outlines
    and testing them on various devices.\r\nOr do your own tests, by seeing how much
    performance difference is made by variations with different numbers of BCPs."

    would one go about testing performance? Also, what are BCPs?"

    second that motion. It takes a lot less time to clean after Scanfont/Fontlab than
    it does to clean up after Illustrator. And of course the automatic letter separation
    trick saves oodles of time."

  body: It depends. You wrote <em>I work with a very talented calligrapher.</em> If
    your calligrapher writes alternate versions for various characters which later
    should be accessed through OpenType features (Stylistic Sets, Contextual Alternates,
    Ligatures ...), it can't be done in TypeTool alone, because TypeTool can not add
    OpenType features to a font.

    and twice as ugly. And the program itself seems to be twice as unstable. "

  body: "There is no clear way to evaluate the amount of time it will take to digitize
    these fonts if you're doing it yourself from the start. \r\n\r\nI agree that FontLab
    is your best bet. Like with anything though, it really depends on how much you're
    willing to invest in time and energy vs. what you want in outcome. Calligraphers
    typically write and connect letters in different ways depending on the context.
    To capture all the nuance and subtlety accurately would require going the longer
    route of learning the program well and doing the fonts in OpenType. Getting feedback
    from your calligrapher along the way would also be helpful. \r\n\r\nMaybe it would
    be worth your while to find someone in the Chicago area that does font development
    to work with on the project."

    the calligrapher. I might need to get some help as well.\r\n\r\nI know opentype
    provides some amazing possibilities, depending on the specific font, I might need
    to look into that. It seems like with alternates combined with kerning pairs,
    it could easily get crazy in the workload. I do want to make sure it's a quality
    product though."

    twice as unstable.</em>\r\n\r\nAlthough I don\u2019t really see it as my task
    to defend FontForge, I actually think that this statement is a bit unfair. Programs
    may have overlapping functionality, but this does not mean by definition that
    the applied (quality of) technology is always identical. For instance the auto-hinter
    for TrueType in FontForge is one of the best I have seen so far. As you know,
    the program is also used for making the conversion to the Cuf\xF3n format (locally
    or on the web). \r\n\r\nPerhaps it is not too simple to get FontForge running
    under X11 on the Mac or under Cygwin on the PC, but it installs very easy on,
    and runs solidly under Linux-distros, like for instance Ubuntu (I am actually
    impressed by version 11.x). Furthermore it is conveniently scriptable and it is
    for free (as are the Linux-distros). \r\n\r\nSo far the advertisement for a competing
    product.\r\n\r\nJosh: <em>Ideally, I'd like to vectorize each letter form [...]</em>\r\n\r\nThis
    requires a program that converts the scanned letters into single glyph databases
    in batch, I reckon. In DTL\u2019s TraceMaster one can select a (theoretically
    unlimited) number of tiff\u2019s and these will be converted into one font file,
    as shown in this small <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WNDdGu9Pqg&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL\">YouTube
    movie</a>.\r\n\r\nSo far the advertisement for one of our own products.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"
