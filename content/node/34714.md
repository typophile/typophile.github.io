  body: "i'm no expert in Cyrillic, but a few things i noticed:\r\n\r\nthe \u0414
    is completely wrong, it's missing the baseline and the descending strokes\r\nit
    is very good that you didn't just double the \u041A to make your \u0416, but these
    two should share a similar structure. I might try adding the horizontal connecting
    stroke to your \u041A.\r\nThe descending stroke on \u0426 and \u0429 is too short,
    IMO, as is the flag on \u042A.\r\nthe same comments apply to the lowercase and
    SC versions of these letters.\r\nthe vertical stroke of the \u0424 could benefit
    from overshooting the capline/baseline, esp in the heaviest weights."

  body: "hello Reetsde,\r\n\r\ni am native cyrillic reader, and generally i like your
    cyrillic. i disagree with Hrant about curved arms -- it is not any requirement
    at all. \r\n\r\nfirst of all, you need to draw a capital \u0414 -- now you have
    \u041B on this place ))\r\nyour black seems almost good, but i think you need
    to reduce blackness in small ovals in \u0432, \u044C, \u0437 and similar letters.
    \u043C also looks too dark, and \u043B looks too light for me.\r\ni think you
    need make similar forms for upper and small \u041B\u043B \u0414\u0434 and i like
    less rectangular form (like your lc). small descenders in \u0434, \u0426\u0446,
    \u0429\u0449 in light and normal is far away from letter body, and \u0448 and
    \u0449 is too wide themselves. i think you need to double left vertical stem of
    \u043B in \u0434 and make its conjunction with lower horizontal so curved. i'd
    like to see narrowed \u044E (like a \u042E), wider \u0416\u0436, higher \u0424,
    and better balanced \u0417\u0437. \r\ncan you try to add some upturn for acsender
    in \u0431?\r\n\r\nsorry for my english, and good luck!"

  body: "Who said anything about \"requirement\"?\r\n\r\nOften, making certain parts
    of Cyrillic forms straight and not curved is a symptom of the desire to be more
    Western and less Russian. Quite ironically -as John H once astutely noted- natives
    tend to suffer from this more than outsiders (speaking more broadly than only
    concerning Cyrillic).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "dear Hrant,\r\n\r\nmy english is so bad and i am sorry for inaccuracy words,
    that i use here.\r\ni think that all curved arms is gimmick of some russians (look
    ie. [[http://eldesign.ru/write/azbuka/letter_k|this article]] if you read russian)
    when they want to come far away from latin. curved arms has some historical roots
    in russian typographic tradition, but plain arms has historical roots too. and
    after all -- cyrillic is not means russian, you know ;))"
