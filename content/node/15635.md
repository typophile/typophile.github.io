  of the book? (Like a french type if it's a french writer or a french subject?

  body: "*gasp* *reaches for [[elements of typographic style|the bible]]*\r\n\r\nAccording
    to [[Robert Bringhurst|Bringhurst]], you should \"Choose a typeface...that will
    honor and elucidate the character of the text.\r\n\r\nHe also says \"Choose a
    face whose historical echoes and associations are in harmony with the text.\"\r\n\r\nIf
    you have a copy (or can get your hands on one) of <em>The Elements of Typographic
    Style</em>, I suggest reading the section \"The Grand Design\" from Chapter 1
    as well as Chapter 6: \"Choosing and Combining Type\"."

    becasue in the same book Mr. Hunt refers there is written\r\n\"seems normal that
    generation of men & women addressed themselves\r\nto writing and printing to keep
    and to share their most deep hopes,\r\nintuitions, dreams and fears\".\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"

  body: "You could always just make it your \"rule.\" It could be your gimmick as
    a book designer - the other designers in S\xE3o Paulo will proclaim \"hey there's
    Estacao, he always matches his typefaces to the national origin or subject matter
    of the book he's designing - now that's hard-core - what a guy!\" as you pass
    them in the street. \r\n"

  body: "As typographers and designers we should be looking for solutions. \r\n\r\nIf
    the solution happens to coincide with the \"rules\" then fine.\r\nIf the solution
    does not coincide with any \"rules\" then that's fine as well.\r\n\r\nI have personally
    always been a strong proponent of process and solution. I will not ask anyone
    to adhere to rules, but to apply them accordingly and wisely IF the solution warrants
    it.\r\n\r\nSo if am trying to design a <em>facsimile</em> of a period piece, then
    ask the right questions:\r\n\r\nIs this trying to look like a 1930s publication
    from France on French poetry?\r\n\r\nOr is it a nineteenth century American book
    press displaying a French poem?\r\n"

    are also good the one as the other one."

    in regards to the intent and target audience of the piece. As said before, \"Don't
    follow rules blindly.\""

  body: There was a big exhibit in Jackson, MS a few years ago titled "The Majesty
    of Spain". The banners and such were set in Italian Old Style. I'm sure no one
    else gave it a second thought, but it irritated the hell out of me.
