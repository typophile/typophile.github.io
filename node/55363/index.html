  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My favorite graphic designers of all time is Saul Bass. He is best know for his movie title sequences, but was also known for his graphic design, including movie posters and corporate identities. His work forms around solid colors, geometric layouts, montage, hand drawn type and dominant symbolism. At the time his work was extremely innovative and I find his design to be timeless and contemporary even today. His movie poster designs are simple and iconic, overwhelmingly powerful, eye catching and always evoke a feeling or mood captured to perfection.

Bass reinvented the movie title as an art form and created them to be an introductory to the feel of the film and worked with some of the most notable directors ever, such as Hitchcock, Scorcese and Kubrick. I was exposed to a lot of his work while in taking film courses in school. My all time favorite and first known exposure to his work is the vertical bar sequence from Psycho, which was so visually striking it has always stuck in my mind (it also stuck in my mind because we analyzed psycho scene by scene for half a semester). It's movement was also inspirational for my type poster design from last semester in Typography I based on the typeface Interstate by Tobias Frere-Jones.  

He also created very strong logos, including those for the Girls Scouts of America, United Airlines, United Way and AT&T.

		<div class="commentbody">Saul Bass was my favourite graphic designer too. His best main title design is for Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, with its erratic horizontal & vertical bars gliding in and out to Bernard Herrmann's jarring music score. I recently re-created & adapted his design for an imagined 2009 version of the movie, as if Hitchcock was alive now and making the movie with a brand new cast. If  anyone would care to see & evalute my effort there are 2 links to download it below. The AVI version is smaller (8-9mb). The DVD version is 150mb. here are the links, a screengrab from my version, and a poster too.

		<div class="commentbody">Your recreation looks great Steviebaby. I really like the poster and the font works perfectly, but I do find that the name Kate Winslet gets a bit mixed up with Christian Bale and Naomi Watts names, maybe play with the size a bit...Great casting choices. I would love to see a remake done with Tarantino and Tim Burton, that would be interesting to see how they would blend their styles to make a rather strange and gory film, if even possible. Anything would be better than Gus Van Sant's remake. </div>
