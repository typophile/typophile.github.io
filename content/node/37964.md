body: An acquaintance and I were recently discussing language reform (Pitman, Deseret,
  Shavian, Quickscript, etc.)  He told me that the lack of ascenders and descenders
  alone is enough to damn any writing system to failure.  But aren't there examples
  of existing (or once existing) writing systems that disprove this notion.  For example,
  Chinese seems to lack these features (ascenders and descenders).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chinese_5698.jpg]
  (I have no idea what this says by the way.) Are there other writing systems that
  anyone else can name?

    success of a writing system. The latin alphabet started out as all majuscules
    and lived through textura, seems to be doing OK.\r\n\r\nCarolingian miniscules
    may have given it a kick in the pants but mostly that was just to expedite handwriting."
