  plates for printing letterpress. I'm looking for more information on the digitizations
  of originally metal type. I'm concerned with the fact that most digital fonts don't
  have optical scaling, whereas most metal faces did (although does anyone know of
  any detailed information on optical scaling of metal types? There is some information
  in Richard Southall's Printer's type in the twentieth century). \r\n\r\nI'm also
  curious about whether types were digitized from actual impressions or the original
  drawings. When ink hits paper there is gain (i.e. ink spread) and ideally I'd like
  to know if that has been taken into account in digitizations. Any references would
  be greatly appreciated! \r\n\r\nI see from previous forum posts that people think
  Centaur was digitized from drawings and thus looks weak but this means it would
  look fine printed letterpress. And I know from taking proofs of 72 pt monotype centaur,
  that at this size there really is no comparison; the metal type is so much more
  refined."

    with polymer plates as anyone. I believe he is now at at Capital Offset in New
    Hampshire. If he'll talk to you, that would be a good source.\r\n\r\nWill Powers
    who frequents Typophile has done a lot of printing with metal. I don't know if
    he's worked with polymer plates, but he has a good eye & might be able to steer
    you toward some sources.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nI have done some work with revivals,
    but I should mention that my interest is entirely practical. I have no professors
    to satisfy, only my eye -- and of course, customers.  \r\n\r\nThat said, there
    are a lot of differences between printing letterpress and printing offset, particularly
    letterpress pre 1960 -- papers and inks as well as the type. Ink spread is not
    linear, so more than just the letterforms themselves matter. Moreover, even though
    \"letterpress,\" a polymer plate will not give the same final printed letter in
    all details as metal, and again, ink and paper are different.\r\n\r\nThe \"reviving\"
    of metal era fonts that I've done is for typesetting by our company only. The
    only successful way I've found to proceed is to adjust the letters, print them
    however you will be doing the final printing (offset in our case), then re-adjust
    your letters looking at the printed work. Eventually, you get it pretty much right.
    With experience, your initial work gets closer to what you want, but you always
    need to come back for final adjustments.\r\n\r\nNothing new here -- you might
    want to read <cite>Counterunch</cite> by Fred Smeijers. Adjusting the letterform
    after looking at how it prints is as old as type itself. It was just faster in
    the old days.\r\n\r\nYou cannot mirror metal letterpress with offset no matter
    how careful you work. I doubt you can mirror it with a polymer plate. The differences
    in the cast letters -- 5 different instances of, say, \"e\", will be significant
    with metal & letterpress. They will be virtually identical CTP-offset. I'd bet
    that with a polymer plate, they will be very close -- much closer than with metal.
    There are other differences, too. The \"baseline\" with metal is not constant,
    there are slight differences when you assemble individually cast letters, whether
    Linotype or Monotype. I doubt this happens much with polymer plates, and of course,
    is absent in CTP-offset.\r\n\r\nFor revivals, the most you can do is capture some
    of the feel of metal letterpress. Perhaps this can come closer with a polymer
    plate, but the little I've seen (I'm no expert with polymer plate letterpress),
    I prefer well done offset, when I can specify the paper, and control the ink by
    choosing the printing firm.  \r\n\r\nBTW, it would be a mistake to say that Centaur
    or Perpetua were fine in metal, bad in offset. There were particular *sizes* of
    Centaur & Perpetua that were wonderful in metal, but as I remember, it was about
    1 size. With Perpetua, it was 14-point italic, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "<cite> > I\u2019m also curious about whether types were digitized from actual
    impressions or the original drawings. </cite>\r\n\r\nFor the standard workhorse
    typefaces that have been in pretty much constant use and production, the answer
    is really \"neither.\" Keep in mind that for these faces, the transition from
    metal to digital was not direct. \r\n\r\nMany, many Linotype and Monotype faces
    went through some version of phototype. Some of these same faces might also have
    been produced in one of the earlier digital formats (pre-Postscript). Digital
    data may have been converted. Rounding errors may have been introduced. Etc.\r\n\r\nIn
    large production environments, each subsequent technological advance tends to
    evolve out of the previous. So in case of some familiar classics, there may be
    years of accretion, attrition, and general evolution in the letterforms (sometimes
    intentional, sometimes unintentional).\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: "Shrdlu:\r\n\r\nI promise not to mention Bembo, and on James\u2019 behalf
    I issue an injunction to all other posters on this thread to avoid that subject
    also.\r\n\r\nI do not really have much to add to what charles_e and Kent have
    said. I do know anecdotally of one conversion of Centaur from metal to photo that
    at least started out going the right way. This photo-ization of Centaur was done
    from printed impressions of Monotype-set Centaur. The impressions were not done
    on the hard, non-absorbent coated stock known as \u201Crepro paper,\u201D but
    were printed onto newsprint on a Vandercook proof press. Talk about \u201Cink
    spread\u201D! The idea was to incorporate that spread of ink into paper into the
    phototype source. So far so good. But then the publication that used the resulting
    type was itself printed on porous newsprint, so the type ended up being far too
    heavy, especially since it was set far too small.\r\n\r\nI am not so sure this
    is what Kent meant when he used the term \u201Cevolution,\u201D since that term
    is generally used to refer to an improvement. Often debatable, I know.\r\n\r\n***\r\nIf
    you cannot find \u201CMonotype Recorder\u201D articles about this, or Adobe specimen
    books, try this: search out recent books or magazines printed offset or gravure
    in faces designed for letterpress printing, then take a look at books printed
    during the heyday of letterpress in those same faces. Do your own analysis of
    differences in the typefaces, and inquire why you see them.\r\n\r\n***\r\nHave
    you read Gerald Lange\u2019s book \u201CPrinting digital type on the hand-operated
    flatbed cylinder press\u201D (gotta love that \u201Cdown\u201D style in the book
    title: way to go, Lange!)?\r\n\r\nIf you go here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bielerpressxi.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nand
    scroll down you\u2019ll find more about it and how to get it. I admit that I\u2019ve
    not looked at it, but because I know Lange\u2019s commitment to good work, and
    because it is one of a very few works you can read on this subject, I\u2019d say
    it should be available in the libraries of all schools that teach book arts. \r\n\r\netaoin\r\n"

  body: "Will, I guess I was actually being fairly Darwinistic in my use of the term
    \"evolution.\" I meant that there may have been adaptations to a given letterform
    -- perhaps due to technological constraints, perhaps due to some inadvertent error
    in copying, whatever. (You could even call them \"mutations.\") These adaptations
    may have been essential to survival in a new technological environment. Or a \"random
    mutation\" might just have gone unnoticed and so didn't have any immediately detrimental
    effect on sales, and thus the adaptation persisted. Either way, the results are
    what I call an \"evolution\" of the letterform(s). Not necessarily an improvement
    -- just part of survival through different environments, if you like.\r\n\r\nMy
    point is that for some faces, the question of whether they were digitized \"from
    actual impressions or the original drawings\" is overly simplistic. (Not meant
    as a criticism of the original poster.)\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    glance says that Gerald's, as Gerald's observations often are, worthy of deeper
    thought than one may wish.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Monotype, (England) as opposed
    to Lanston (Monotype America) P22 chose different paths, paths not neccesarily
    of their own making. However they merged to meet again with distant conclusions.
    Gerald, the other Gerald not myself, has pointed out correctly that there is variances
    from metal to polymer no matter how hard one tries. Gerald, the other knows I
    pioneered polymer, owned Lanston, digitized directly from patterns, preserving
    as closely as \"we at Lanston could, which was, very, very close\" (15 thousand
    per cent more so than is possible with \"Type One Fonts, not to mention source
    material) the original letter forms, noting that this has met with criticism from
    those suffering from mind altering drugs. Barring lugubrious opinions, my work
    is worthy of new-review, Important, not embarrassing, and unfortunately for you,
    not possible.\r\n\r\nClosely I have not followed P22, trustfully they have at
    least preserved original data. The data was taken from patterns, the final form
    for mechanical typesetting. Different, sometimes more often than not, the abundance
    of direct human creations by cutting punches with the human hand/eye produced
    products without mechanical direction produced masterpieces. Re-read what I just
    said, view as a clue. Almost all is lost. I was not won over by Stanley Morrison's
    letters to Jan Van Krimpen. There fore you ar not lost. Unless you so choose.\r\n\r\nMy
    conclusion, as is yours is obvious, metal type is far different than digital than
    we would wish. Imitation, at this point without resources as I was greatly honoured,
    by owning the Lanston Library, could we say is, now legendary. And legendary as
    it is, was not, should we say, completely possible, but, I must part with you,
    beautiful.\r\n\r\nFinal note: optical scaling was offered by Lantston and American
    Type Foundery in type three format. This is not a foundry problem it is a format
    problem. Maybe you could take this issue up with John Hudson, Hrant certainly
    seems to have retired on this subject.\r\n\r\nIn any event, talk to your local
    format dealer!\r\n\r\nFinal final note: revisit, Frederic Goudy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiampa"
