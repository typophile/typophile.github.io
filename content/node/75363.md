body: "I'm considering using Century Schoolbook for a book project and looking into
  the Century type family has left me a bit confused..\r\n\r\nWhilst going through
  samples of different 'Century Schoolbook's in use and what's available here at school,
  there seems to be stark differences between some of the different Century Schoolbooks
  I've found. I.e. Bitstrem Century Schoolbook compared to Monotype Century Schoolbook
  looks very different in continuous text.\r\n\r\nLooking around at the Typowiki and
  Wikpiedia page on Century didn't help either. Any information on the different 'Century
  Schoolbook's would be appreciated. (i.e. What was actually improved on in New Century
  Schoolbook if that was the cause behind the design?)\r\n\r\nLastly, what are opinions
  on a good Century Schoolbook for text? I'm leaning towards Bistream's version, feels
  heavier and sturdier. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Not to disrespect you in any way, but why is any of this important? Bitstream's
    version is a truer reproduction of original Morris Fuller Benton-designed foundry
    type; the Linotype and Monotype versions were probably originally developed for
    linecasting machines. However, if one version looks better than another to your
    eye, then all the rationale in the world shouldn't affect your judgment.

    several other recuttings by Linotype. The biggest difference that I can recall,
    compared to "old" Century Schoolbook, was that the family was expanded to four
    weights. Ironically, only the two weights it shares with the old version are available
    currently. '

    Shen's analysis of Century Schoolbook]]. She has scans of the originals there,
    so you can judge for yourself what is most like the original, if that is what
    you are looking for. \r\n\r\nCentury Schoolbook looks best large, where it looks
    very strong and rather attractive. For normally small adult text, Century Expanded
    I believe has been used more often. "

    often describe movements in typography borrowing terms and concepts from the history
    of art, but this circumscribes categorization, omitting that which is unique to
    typography. Juliet describes Century Schoolbook as ATF's original \"legibility\"
    face; Cheltenham was also informed by knowledge of reading research (the lesser
    role of descenders in character recognition), as was Clearface, of course and
    the Linotype news faces of the Legibility program (Ionic, Excelsior, &c.). The
    design movement such faces represent, Legibility, is an important characteristic
    of the early 20th century.\r\n\r\nDespite the dominance of historicism at that
    time, the Legibility movement was an expression of the progressive, socially-minded
    forces at work in North American society, and just as the simplicity of Arts and
    Crafts was germane to the emergence of Modernist minimalism, so the Legibility
    movement contributed to its functionalism.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Excelsior_5527.png]\r\n\r\nCentre
