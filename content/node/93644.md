body: "Does anyone have any idea what this font is? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_copy_6109.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  very similar to Garamond stencil: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/garamond/garamond-stencil-d-medium/
  but not as solid.. and there seems to be only two cuts of Garamond stencil that
  exist. \"What da Font\" is also no help as the forms are broken and the app, for
  example, confuses each side of the 'O' as separate letters.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be greatly appreciated, thanking you all in advance.\r\n\r\nM\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Just drag one image on top of the other to make WTF aware that it's a single glyph.
