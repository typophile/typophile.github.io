body: What is the best way to have a separate set of combining diacritics for capital
  letters?  I tried using the [[case]] feature, but it's support is quite limited,
  as is for contextual substitution in Latin for most programs. Is there another way
  other than using a myriad pre-combined ligatures of base+mark?

  body: I use the ccmp feature with contextual lookups to map from the lowercase (combining)
    accents to uppercase and smallcap variants. You can duplicate the lookups in calt
    for legacy support in CS2 if you like.
