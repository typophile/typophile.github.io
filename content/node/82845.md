body: "\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is not so much a design question, but I've already
  spent quite a bit of time trying to decide on the fonts and formatting of my engineering
  PhD thesis (I should really be writting it, not making it pretty, so I thought I'd
  ask for some advice).\r\n\r\nSome of my figures will be made using software that
  only allows for a choice between one serif or sans serif font. The thesis guidelines
  require me to use a serif font for figures and sans serif for main body text. I've
  been able to determine that the sans serif font included in the software for figures
  is Helvetica. However, I'm writting my thesis in word and don't have access to Helvetica
  (and I can't add fonts on my computer because it's managed externally).\r\n\r\nI
  can't resolve myself to use Arial for headings and captions throughout the thesis,
  but I want to limit the number of fonts and make everything look as consistant as
  possible. The amount of text in the Helvetica figures will be minimal (only labels
  and legends), so I was thinking of finding a nice font that might not be too obviously
  different and hope people don't notice... It's not ideal, but I have no better solution
  for the moment.\r\n\r\nWhat font would you suggest I use as a nice and clean (it's
  engineering, so it needs to look somewhat technical) sans serif font that has similarities
  with Helvetica (without being Arial, which is used to death and unappealing to me)?
  What serif font would you match it with? I'm also going to have a lot of math in
  my thesis, so I need to consider a font that includes an extensive range of symbols
  (math symbols and greek letters, mostly). Since I can't add fonts, it would be helpful
  if you can suggest fonts that are typically available on windows systems.\r\n\r\nMy
  thesis will be printed, but most of the versions will be read on screen, so I'd
  like fonts that are a good compromise between screen and print legibility.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated, as my sense of graphical design is twitching every time
  I look at my thesis in its current format.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAudrey"

    ClearType Font Collection]]. These fonts were designed for both screen and print,
    so I think they are a good choice; also there is a chance that you might have
    them already if you are running Windows Vista or if you have Office 2007 installed.
    I would go for Calibri(Sans-serif) and Cambria(Serif). They are available for
    purchase from [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/calibri-and-cambria-families.aspx|Ascender
    Fonts]]. For more info go [[http://www.ascendercorp.com/catalog/microsoft/clear-type-font-collection/|here]].\r\n\r\n\r\nSB\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screensplash_6011.png]"

    or Arial (the options are quite limited) & Times New Roman. These four fonts should
    meet your typographical requirements and you most certainly have them installed.\r\n\r\nFocus
    on the typography and not on the typefaces. Print samples. For example, try to
    see at what size/leading does Georgia (which is optimized for screen but should
    work in print also) invites you to read it, provided there are no more than twelve
    words per line. Check out Times too. It is neither ugly nor boring. Arial, having
    so many glyphs, is highly useful. You could do a nice piece of engineering of
    your thesis with some carefully planned typography using these fonts."

  body: "Thanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nI didn't realise how complex my problem
    might sound. Michel basically summed up what I'm working with. The software that
    I use produces some graphics that I will be pasting into my thesis as figures.
    I don't have a way of changing the font in the figures. The software isn't actually
    installed on my computer, it runs on a computer cluster. The cluster computers
    may or may not have Helvetica installed (not sure how that works), but my computer
    doesn't.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking for a new font to install, as I don't have administrator
    privileges on my computer (and thus can't do much setup-wise). So yes, I was hoping
    for some ideas of font combinations amongst some of the fonts I would already
    have installed.\r\n\r\nThanks Michel for your idea of editing the graphics. I'll
    look into it, but I'll probably run into a similar problem as the font issue:
    can't install any software unless it has been pre-approved. I'll look through
    the list of what we have to see if something might work... but I'm using .eps
    figures, so editing is likely to be tricky."

    Arial for figures.\r\nBut do you mean figures or figure captions? Surely your
    software does not input captions directly, does it? Or do you mean text inside
    the image?\r\n\r\nSans serif for whole body text is also a little bit unusual,
    though I've seen institutions forcing students to use Arial 12 points for sections,
    chapter titles, everything.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing only Word is also a problem, but
    I wouldn't suggest swithing to Latex/Xelatex either at this point (takes some
    time to get used to it), even though you could install it on a pendrive and in
    theory have it use any font in any directory with some commands.\r\nAnd if you're
    using Word 2003 it must be a pain to insert equations, too (without additional
    software)."
