  body: 'Futura(esqe), but seriously mistreated. I don''t have Futura, so I can''t
    replicate your sample. If you don''t have it either, you can use Twentieth Century
    (TW Cen MT on Windows machines) as a substitute. '

  body: I tried to put this together, and it does seem like West and Star are in Futura,
    but then Mortgage couldn't be Futura with the two story a - so I think maybe helvetica?

  body: "Nah, that isn't Helvetica. Look at the bowl of the \"a\". Or the top of the
    \"t\".\r\nUnivers (57 Condensed, and then additionally [[squooshed]]) seems closer,
    but isn't quite \"it\" either."
