<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
I was looking at both, they both seem pretty much the same design-wise (note that I haven't verified closely). I was wondering if any of you knew which one was best (not only design wise)? I'm not sure but it seems Bitstream's is a TTF in a OTF, whereas ITC's is a PS in OTF.
Also I was wondering what sans-serif you'd use with it, I was thinking maybe FF Scala Sans Pro since it has support for many languages, and a good range of features like Charter, and a design that would fit well I think. Only problem is that I cannot try it for real because the only font I have from both is Charis SIL (Charter clone) that lacks many of the features I want, but I thought some of you would know.
Thanks</div>

<div class=commentbody>Pierre-Luc Auclair> I have wanted to know this very same information. Unfortunately, I do not have the answer. But generally speaking I have noticed ITC/Monotype to be more expensive than other distributors for a similar, if not the same product.
In this particular instance, I would go with Bitsteam on the basis of price. Charter BT PRO is $199 and ITC Charter Pro is $239. But I and you might too, be worried about proper kerning table programing and other technical considerations... I just don't know about that :-(
{Compare Rotis from Linotype and Monotype} Letraset is another distributor that is about $20 more expensive for the same type.
Sorry I'm not very much help,
Mikey</div>

<div class=commentbody>There is yet another "Pro" version of Charter in OpenType format, made by ParaType. It's $125:

<div class=commentbody>Charter started out as a Bitstream face and then was picked up by ITC.
I did a detailed analysis of Charter years ago for a client and found that with the exception of the lowercase o, Charter shared a lot of the proportions of Joanna, or was well close.
Perhaps Gill Sans will go well with Charter.
