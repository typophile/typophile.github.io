  body: "Hi Graham,\r\n\r\nSeveral of our Font Diner faces were inspired by these
    styles often referred to as Brightwork but we call 'em streamlined scripts . .
    .\r\n\r\nEmblem Chief was actually inspired by an International Harvester refrigerator
    logo: http://www.fontdiner.com/menu_cfp.html\r\n\r\nContinental Railway also shares
    the same connecting look: http://www.fontdiner.com/menu_brown.html\r\n\r\nPermanent
