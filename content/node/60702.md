  body: Penn posted this in his personal blog. As long as he's not posting links to
    piracy or porn I don't see the harm in the original question. (Although I don't
    know if it would get any serious attention without a little more information.)

    They\u2019re a good temp agency to get by on, and when they have temp-to-perm
    work the jobs tend to be with very desirable employers who don\u2019t post jobs
    publicly.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, stay in DC. Don\u2019t make the mistake that
    so many people have and come to New York. New York is now giving free airfare
    home to people who came here for work and ended up homeless!"
