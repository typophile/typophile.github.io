  the basic structure is almost done, now it's time to make some subtle adjustments.\r\nThis

  body: Nice, I think they look rather polished. Hrant's trapping technique looks
    interesting. What kind of diameter circles are those? I'll wait for the PDF to
    look at it more closely.

  body: "I think the traps look promising, but to be honest, for me at least it's
    pretty futile to try and judge inktraps (of all things!) by staring at huge glyphs
    on a monitor. Hell, I can't even tell if you need traps. So, yup, looking forward
    to the PDF. :-)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd second Jelmar, I'd love some explanation on how
    exactly you applied Hrant's method!"

    It's somehow a \"voyeuristical\" task, ain't it? Even in hard copies, I tend to
    think of ink traps more as a shape-for-the-shape-itself (BTW, not necessarily
    arbitrary) than as a functional unavoidable requirement.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

  body: "I agree that it is rather futile to judge inktraps on screen, to judge if
    you even need them at all. Although I think it's safe to say that you always need
    some form of optical correction (in the form of inktraps or in other ways). And
    yes, I think aesthetics also plays a role (shape-for-the-shape-itself).\r\n\r\nLooking
    forward to the PDF about the trapping technique (it's Hrant's technique, so he
    must be okay with it)."
