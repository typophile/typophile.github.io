  body: "<em>Thanks to whoever worked on this!</em>\r\n\r\nYour welcome!\r\nThe rare
    book room was very excited that people who appreciate these things will get to
    see them. Having a Doves Bible in a Doves binding placed into my hands was a humbling
    experience. It is a lot smaller than you would imagine in person (like most celebrities
    I suppose). There may even be an Ashendene book in the exhibit, Eben!\r\n\r\nI
    checked, sheep are not allowed  in the library. Sorry."
