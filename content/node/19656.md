body: I'm wondering if there's a simple method for plotting equations into a drawing
  program (doesn't matter which), and then producing glyphs from that. For instance,
  I like the "<a href="http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/eggcurves.htm" target="_blank">egg
  curve</a>," but I can't see an easy way to move from the equations to the glyphs.
  I don't exactly want to learn Postscript.

    to output EPS graphics from nearly any well-behaved 2D or 3D function.  On newer
    versions of OS X, there's a \"Grapher\" application that can also export to EPS
    or PDF.  Most interactive Font editing programs should be able to somehow deal
    with those formats.\r\n\r\nBut be careful, mathematical functions seldom make
    for good glyphs, and in my opinion their overuse has given mathematical or parametric
    font creation tools such as METAFONT an undeserved bad reputation."

  body: "Thanks, Tim. I'm interested mainly in using the equations as a starting point
    for creating shapes. I've got nothing against free drawing, messing with Bezier
    curves, etc.\r\n\r\nI actually got interested in the idea of using equations when
    I started pencil-sketching some glyphs based on my own print handwriting-- the
    same egg-like shape kept occurring over and over, and I thought there oughta be
    a way to define it precisely and then reproduce as starting point."

    body: That's just what I had in mind.  I'm actually very much interested in using
      mathematical formulae for encoding design intentions instead of endless twiddling
      with control points.  If you're familiar with Knuth's Computer Modern fonts,
      you'll be aware that they are often criticized for - among other things - being
      to formulaic; and rightly so. My point is that this is more the fault of the
      authors attitude and the temptation of the tools than the idea itself, but the
      temptation seems very real!
