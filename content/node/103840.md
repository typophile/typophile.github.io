  body: "Easy to make but clumsy in appearance -- IMHO these letters are a product
    of too much DIY font making. Start with a nice Didone  and infest it with ball
    terminals, ball swashes and balls on crossbars--we see H, I suspect A was also
    hit.  For some reason the \"designer\" missed the beak on C and the crossbar on
    E. Perhaps it is available as a \"free\" font, and could be located by searching
    the ornamented categories. If nothing turns up, the lettering could be called
    \"Ballpox.\" Perhaps I am too harsh, I can see it as a descriptive title for a
    story about a closet -- all those balls resemble hooks for hanging clothes. \r\nDon"

  body: "I suspect someone's butchered this as a logo, but given any repeated character
    has precisely the same form, that led me to conclude it was an actual font 'out
    there' somewhere.\r\n\r\nSadly I've had to manually create a set of vector shapes
    to recreate the logo. I could not find the font on all the usual free font sites,
    admittedly it could fall under any number or categories - it's such (poor) font.\r\n\r\nEach
    to their own I suppose, but it's not my cup of tea either!"
