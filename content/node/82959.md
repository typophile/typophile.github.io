  I've been practicing my type drawing skills, but I'm ready to take it to the next
  level (digitizing). I've heard many bad things about Fontlab, but I understand it
  is the industry standard. How about Glyphs app in the mac app store? [[http://glyphsapp.com/]]
  Does anyone have experience with this yet? \r\n\r\nThanks for any input, I've learned
  a great deal from this forum so far. \r\n\r\n-Tim"

  body: "Tim, Look at Type Tool or Fontographer - and any bad things you have heard
    about Fontlab are usually someone who has not worked with it very long - it is
    not perfect but it is the industry standard. Until it came along Fontographer
    was and is still a good choice and one in which I had students up and running
    very quickly. Both Type Tool and Fontographer also have pathways to upgrade to
    Fontlab. Good luck with your choice,\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/"

    might be a couple of others on the subject as well.
