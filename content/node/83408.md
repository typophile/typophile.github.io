  | Myfonts]] and [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/gatf/tuscaloosa | Fontspring]].\r\n\r\nTuscaloosa
  is a classic American \u2018Wild West\u2018 Tuscan typeface-we thought it would
  make a suitable Independence Day tribute to our American clients.  It\u2019s ideal
  for wherever that \u2018Western\u2018 feel is wanted.  Posters, signage, the sides
  of stagecoaches etc\u2026 Three faces are offered, a pristine and sharp regular
  form, a somewhat distressed \u2018Rustic\u2018 face and the rather more distressed
  \u2018Extremely Rustic\u2019.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tuscaloosa_Sample_5172.png]"
