  over running a cat charity website here in Sweden and the owner does not know what
  font was used in making the gfx for the site but would like the existing typeface

    free font by Steven J. Lundeen (1997, Emerald City Fontwerks) but I have also
    seen this font under the names \"TR Augie\" and \"Crap pl\" with no explicit copyright
    message in it, so I suggest to be extra careful if you need to acquire a commercial
    license for your project.\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI

  body: '"TR Augie" is Lundeen''s font renamed and with a new (c) notice by ''Sherlock
    Fonts'' who dumped a couple of hundred pirated and renamed fonts on the world
    (with nothing else changed) about ten years ago. I hadn''t seen Crap PL, but found
    it and, as I guessed, it''s a third party addition of some characters to support
    the Polish language. One good fix there is that the polish version corrects the
    ''no embedding'' flag that the old version of Fontographer defaulted to in Steve
    Lundeen''s original.  - Herb'
