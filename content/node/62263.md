body: "According to the newly published [[http://www.apastyle.org/|sixth edition of
  APA publication manual]] (p 73), people who participate in an experiment are no
  longer referred to solely as  participants. They can now referred to as participants
  <em>and</em> subjects. Originally, people were referred to as subjects, and at some
  point the term participant was adopted and the term subject was reserved for animals
  (I'm not a historian).\r\n\r\nIt's nice that we are \"allowed\" to use the term
  subjects again as it is consistent with the long standing acronym Ss."

    psychology. I believe the term came from the applied field of user centered design,
    where the people brought in for lab studies are viewed as participants in the
    design process."
