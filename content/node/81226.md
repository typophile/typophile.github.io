body: "I get the interesting error below when I try to compile features in an OT script
  font. The notable things are that the claimed number of elements is absurdly large,
  and the error message is claiming that a number is not equal to itself. The only
  features in the font are calt and maybe kern.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that I have
  seen this error before, and it does mean something, but as the error message itslf
  is bogus, I can't recall for sure what that is. Is it related to overflow of the
  64K size limit on a subtable in OpenType? That rings a bell for me....\r\n\r\n[ERROR]
  <FontName> Target glyph class in sub-rule doesn't have the same number of elements
  as the replacement class; the target has 87747800, the replacement, 87747800 [//vmware-host/Shared
  Folders/My Documents/Shared Data/FontLab/Studio 5/fontlab.fea 133]\r\n"

    number of elements is bogus, there really is a mismatch. This is probably the
    most likely possibility....\r\n\r\nT"

    on line 133 that might provide a clue?

  body: I remember getting this error a few times.  I don't recall the REAL reason
    but I do recall that the error message had nothing logical to do with the solution.
    It may have something to do with kerning classes but I can't be sure. Try rebuilding
    the kern feature from the "Kerning Assistance" window and then save quit, and
    restart FontLab.
