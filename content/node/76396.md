  and I am a stone carver in the Eric Gill tradition. That's my passion and you can
  see some of my work and also stuff about other interests (ephemera etc) at my new
  blog which can be found here\r\nhttp://stoneletters.wordpress.com/\r\nIt's only
  been running a couple of weeks so it's pretty raw as I get to learn how to drive
  the machine. \r\nI'm based in Australia now, though I was born and lived in the
  UK until my late 40s when we emigrated to Oz. I learnt my craft from master carvers
  in and around London, including John Skelton, a brilliant and funny man, who was
  a nephew of Eric Gill. (And a spitting image of him too.)\r\nThough stone lettering
  has a long history, especially in Europe and the US, it's not very common down under.
  And though I keep mentioning Gill don't think I am set in the past - lettering adapts
  and evolves and that's what I am interested in, finding ways to continue the craft
  in the 21st century.\r\nAnyhow, hope you enjoy the historical perspective of my
  stuff and I look forward to meeting others who share the love for stone carving.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nel-mezzo_3504.jpg]"

    nephew David Cox. You'll be pleased to hear that it's the usual same grey, windy
    and rainy here in the UK."
