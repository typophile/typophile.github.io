  a design myself...  <BR>It&#39;s my first, so I&#39;m sure you can find an obscene

  body: ' I like this. My only criticism on first glance is that some of the character
    widths seem to be inconsistent, primarily in the lower case characters. Lc &#34;r&#34;
    and &#34;s&#34;, for example, seem a bit wide, while lc &#34;k&#34;, &#34;x&#34;
    and perhaps &#34;f&#34; seem a bit narrow. <BR> <BR>On the whole, the upper case
    seems a bit narrow compared to the lower case, also. I&#39;m not sure, however,
    if the upper case should be widened or if the lower case should be narrowed. I
    suppose it depends on the overall width you&#39;re going for. <BR> <BR>Aside from
    this, I like a lot of the design decisions you made. You&#39;ve managed to soften
    and humanize a very rigid geometric genre. <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' Hey, thanks for the reply. <BR>I was going for a condensed font, as in the
    UC, I can see that the Uc and Lc looks sort of different. thanks for that one.  <BR>I&#39;m
    going to condense the Lc &#34;r&#34;, as it is too wide...I&#39;ll have a closer
    look at the Lc &#34;s&#34; also.  <BR> <BR>Any more suggestions/comments? Should
    I make more weights? '

    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Anyway, what&#39;s comanion fonts? I&#39;m from Sweden,
    and I&#39;m having some difficulties understanding some words here... <BR> <BR>I
    started on a thinner version of the above, but I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s
    any smart way of doing the rough version automatic, and then clean it up? &#40;using
    Illustrator&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post a flash instead of a low res when I get
    it to work. '

  body: 'Hmmm... When I mentioned italics as being one of many companions to a font,
    I didn&#39;t necessarily mean that an italic would be necessary for THIS one.
    I meant that this font could benefit from other sorts of companions, specifically
    weights and widths. <BR> <BR>Still, should you choose to try, it would be an interesting
    challenge to come up with a newish italic design for a squared geometric sans-serif
    face such as this '
