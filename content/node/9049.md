    that&#39;s a super thread I&#39;d forgotten about &#40;with Olduvai a major star&#41;,
    but maybe I shouldn&#39;t have put unCourier &#40;as I call it&#41; and Ergo Sketch
    on equal footing... Fonts that look hand-lettered are relevant and interesting,
    but they&#39;re more like Faux Faux Type! They pretend to be handmade. I think
    we can agree that there&#39;s still a cachet to the &#34;real thing&#34;, and
    as rare as it is, I&#39;m hoping people can find nice examples of that. <BR> <BR>Like

    I think, it is a long time since I looked at it -- <i>An Atlas of Typeforms</i>.
    On first glance, the book looks typeset because the lettering is so neat and regular
    and decidedly typographic &#40;although not modelled on a particular typeface,
    I think&#41;. I&#39;ll try to track down the exact reference tomorrow.

    <BR> <BR>Much cleaner, and in a later style. It mimics either neo-classical or
    romantic types, I forget which: but with a vertical axis and high contrast, written
    with a split nib. In terms of the subject of this thread, it it more interesting
    than the <i>Paraphrasi</i> manuscript, which is remarkable for it neatness but
    still belongs to an age and style in which types were modelled on humanist roman
    and chancery italic hands, and in which writing masters were actively involved
    in the development of new types &#40;Mardersteig thinks, for example, that Marcolini&#39;s
    italic types were based directly on Pietro Alluno&#39;s italic hand&#41;. But
    the later example to which I referred -- which I will try to find, because now
    it is bothering me -- belongs to an age when the division between chirographic
    and typographic letters had widened&#42;  <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;Although I think
    the romantic type design of Bodoni represents a step closer to a chirography than
    the preceding century or so of type design; we tend to miss this, because Bodoni
    revivals tend to be over-rationalised and because most British and North American
    calligraphy of the past hundred years is of the broad-nib, renaissance variety,
    rather than the split-nib baroque and romantic. <BR>_____ <BR> <BR>Off topic,
    but speaking of Marcolini, can anyone interpret his allegorical printer&#39;s
    mark? The motto is &#39;Truth is the daughter of time&#39;, but I can&#39;t figure
    out who the third figure is, or what they&#39;re all doing. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/64680.jpg"

    It wouldn&#39;t be unusual for lithographic or engraved plates to be handlettered
    but made to look like type. [Indeed, the opposite is also true: neo-classical
    and romantic types were designed to look like engraved letters. Baskerville worked
    as an engraver before he took up printing and publishing.] <BR> <BR>But Hrant
    is right to point out that significant variation in letters can occur in letterpress
    printing. This <a href="http://www.tiro.com/John/Baskerville-a.jpg">photograph</a>
    shows the many forms of a lowercase <i>a</i> that occur on a single page &#40;p.183&#41;
    of Baskerville&#39;s 1758 edition of <i>Paraside Lost.</i> As you can see, the
    variance is remarkable, affecting weight, proportion and shape of different aspects
    of the letter.'
