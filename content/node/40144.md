  body: Very nice! I really need to go back and document some of my work better. Showing
    the progression like that is always nice.

  body: Thanks for the compliment! I see alot of "work in progress sketches" for new
    typefaces, but never for any logo designs. I'm going to make a habit of doing
    this from now on too.

  body: "I'll be honest, I was a bit skeptical after seeing the initial sketches,
    but as the flickr set ended, my impression grew and grew. Very well done indeed.\r\n\r\nI've
    shared this with some of my fellow designers for their reference as well. It's
    also intriguing to see someone's process spelled out like that."

  body: Cool!  I've been trying to piece together a similar documentation... but retroactively,
    and I keep missing pieces of paper (napkins?) I scrawled on and such.  Thanks
    for sharing.
