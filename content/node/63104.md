  body: "Thanks for the guess!  \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if might even be a custom font.
    \ Though similar to Eurostile the \"a\" on \"mpbata\" logo curves up more making
    the counter more pointed than it is in Eurostile, where it seems to curve downward.
    \ \r\n\r\nAny other thoughts/guesses?"

  body: "I see your point about the 'a'. [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/housegothic23/viewfonts|House
    Gothic Extended Light (1 or 2)]] is quite similar if you modify their 't'.\r\n\r\nI
    also thought [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_monoline/monoline_medium.html|Foundry
    Monoline]] was similar, but the t needs editing.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
