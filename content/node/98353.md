  the first time, using Fontlab, and, guess what - it's slightly confusing...\r\n\r\nwhat
  I'd like OpenType to do is:\r\nfor lots of specific character pairs, substitute
  pairs of alternate characters\r\n\r\nso, for example, if someone types 'AB' I'd
  like OpenType to substitute glyph A_2 followed by glyph B_2...\r\n\r\nI was kind
  of thinking I could do this with a contextual alternate feature like\r\n\r\n<code>sub
  A' B' by A_2 B_2;</code>\r\n\r\nbut that doesn't seem to compile\r\n\r\n<code>sub
  A B' by B_2;</code>\r\n\r\ncompiles OK, but doesn't really do what I want...\r\n\r\ndoes
  what I'm trying to do make any sense? is it possible?\r\n\r\nwould a better way
  be to make all my desired glyph combinations as ligature glyphs? (and also make
  all the individual alternate glyphs separately available)\r\n\r\nany help would
  be great"

    used to indicate ligatures between two characters, and periods to precede suffixes.
    Suffixes might also be more descriptive if you have different kinds of alternates\u2013
    i.e. <code>.alt[x]</code> for general alternates, <code>.swsh[x]</code> for swashes,
    (where <code>[x]</code> is a numeric index), <code>.smcp</code> for small caps,
    etc."

    it seems to me that OpenType *does* permit m2m substitutions (using GSUB type
    5 or 6 lookups) but none of the common tools (VOLT and AFDKO) provide a way to
    express these such rules.\r\n\r\nSo I've often wondered if rendering engines actually
    support m2m lookups or not?  \r\n "

      but I think InDesign does. I constructed a many-to-many translation with a TTX
      dump as intermediary."

  body: "<cite>For glyph names, underscores are customarily used to indicate ligatures
    between two characters</cite>\r\n\r\nMore than custom. IIRC, when generating a
    PDF, that's what the Adobe engine will assume & make happen. So, if you have a
    glyph named A_B in your font, that glyph will become the two characters A & B
    in a PDF text stream. (Or, I may not RC...)\r\n\r\nA period is what you want;
    everything after the period is dropped. So, \"A.(anything)\" remains \"A\"."

  body: Thanks for elaborating, Charles. That's my understanding as well, but was
    trying to stay succinct with the naming advice. No doubt the topic has been [[http://typophile.com/node/33330#comment-200526|discussed
    here before at some point]].

    B. They supply PDF files, without fonts, of course. Publisher B has to take the
    text stream & use it for the resetting. \r\n\r\nAnd you're trying to be succinct?
    I've been involved in a few projects where recovering the text was, shall we say
    (amongst other choice words), expensive. \r\n\r\nOr did you mean you wouldn't
    write the code that way, it was just for this example? Don't scare old people
    like me. Use a period, even in examples."

  body: Charles, perhaps I was not clear. I did use a period in my example code, then
    <em>succinctly</em> advised the original poster to use periods instead of underscores
    for suffixes, without fully elaborating on the matter. You explained the technical
    reasons behind this practice, so I thanked you for taking the time to do so (whereas,
    in my succinctness, I had not) and linked to a more detailed discussion on the
    topic. So I'm pretty sure we're in agreement.

  body: thanks everyone for your replies and the ensuing discussion... I've realised
    there was some illogic in what I was trying to do and, in figuring that out, and
    considering your contributions, I am now somewhat wiser!
