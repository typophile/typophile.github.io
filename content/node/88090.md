  body: That would be a pretty frightening EULA if it does exist. I don't recall anything
    like that either.

  body: "That doesn\u2019t make sense. A EULA is there to define what rights are reserved
    by the foundry, and what rights you will get by purchasing a license. The purchaser
    of the license is only liable for the rights that are transferred to him by the
    EULA and for all other rights the foundry is liable.\r\n\r\n-Paul"

    are probably giving you boilerplate from contracts that they use for commissioned
    work, where indemnities are a common topic to be negotiated. Look up indemnification
    in the Graphic Artists Guild handbook for more information. \r\n\r\nSome businesses
    have insane indemnification boilerplate in any contract with creatives because
    it\u2019s cheaper to do that than to keep getting advice from legal. This is the
    kind of thing you should have an attorney negotiate for you and buy insurance
    to cover\u2014and obviously don\u2019t indemnify anyone won\u2019t pay more than
    the cost of insurance!. Sure your licensees are not likely to be sued, but if
    some copyright crank goes after the wrong client and you signed a broadly worded
    contract you could end up in an ugly spot."
