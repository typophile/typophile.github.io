  body: 'Great fun, but not terribly convincing, since the single syllable words don''t
    present anything like the full extent of variation in English spelling. There''s
    no way that English spelling can be made phonetic without extending the number
    of letters in our alphabet: there are simply too many sounds to be represented
    by too few letters. Even if one made the representation of short vowels consistent
    -- sum dum bum --, one would quickly run out of letters and have no way to represent
    other vowels, diphthongs, slurs, etc.'

  body: "I recall that back in the Seventies, there was an article by Ed in U&lc.
    It explained the entire \"Sound Spel\" system. While I'm sure there were limits,
    as you point out, it did seem like it would be an improvement over the present
    system on some levels. And it would certainly be easier to learn. The thing that
    bothered me about it was that it would disconnect English from its roots. The
    thing about English is that it is a melange of other languages, which is also
    why its spelling is so inconsistent. Make the spelling consistent, and all that
    would be hidden. Or at least it would be harder to see. Also, how would you decide
    how to spell \"either\" and \"tomato\"?\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that, I still find
    Ed's critique entertaining and clever.\r\n"

  body: "Ironically, I got that wrong: It should be \"soundspel\" or \"SoundSpel,\"
    not \"Sound Spel.\" \r\n\r\nThe article appeared in the second issue of U&lc.
    (vol. 1, no. 2). In case anyone is interested, there is an article on Wikipedia
    about the system:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundSpel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundSpel</a>"
