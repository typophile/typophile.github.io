body: I considered putting this under &#34;Display&#34; but I hope to also show you
  guys a non-stencil Sans version in the near future. <BR> <BR>Why stencil? Because
  I figure everyone needs a stencil typeface in their library and I&#39;d rather make
  my own rather than use someone else&#39;s creation. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1079.jpg"

    Overall a pleasing structure &#40;if you would do something about the letters
    mentioned&#41; '

  body: ' I agree. The way those letters ended up is a result of having such a narrow
    width. When diagonals come together separated by the stencil support &#40;whatever
    they&#39;re called&#41; it looks like it&#39;s one big geometric shape with a
    line through it, rather than a couple of bars coming together. <BR> <BR>The way
    other stencils have solved this is to have the support diagonal rather than vertical.
    When I first created the typeface, however, I was hoping to avoid that because
    I wanted it to be more uniform... I may have to reconsider that. <BR> <BR>Any
    comments on the &#34;Q&#34;? It gave me some trouble and I&#39;m not sure I like
    how it turned out. '

  body: ' John, very likable face.  <BR> <BR>The new letters appear to change what
    made this different -- the stencil gaps were all vertical. However, the changes
    are more pleasing. <BR> <BR>If you are going to make this change througout, then
    the 7 and Z are also candidates. <BR> <BR>Also, the R might look better if it
    follows from the B form. <BR> <BR>The only other thing is the H. The small stubs
    almost disappear. <BR> <BR>good job <BR>bj '
