  start to display his work for critique? I've got very rudimentary outlines going
  and a usable, if not pretty, font started.\r\n\r\nHow much self-woodshedding should
  I undertake before allowing my precious creation into the realm of critique?\r\n\r\n(Or
  am I just overanalyzing this and should get over it already and post the blasted
  thing...)\r\n\r\n[Blather off]"

  body: metalfoot, I think that if you feel something is ready for a critique, then
    go for it. I tend to overthink things, too! :-)

    it helps to have thick skin.

  body: I'm just wondering if it's better to let fly with the incompetence early on
    and get it cleared up or wait till later and then suffer more, I suppose...!

  body: I've always been a 'let 'er rip' kind of person. Sometimes this works. Other
    times the results are not what I expected. Your mileage may vary.

  body: "Sometimes I'm hestitant to put my work up for genuine critique as well. I
    do it all the time of course , because critique is too valuable to ignore. (Although
    I haven't posted much on Typophile directly too often, my work is available on
    my website/flickr page and so on).\r\n\r\nBut I overthink it too, most of the
    times... "

  body: "Critiques are part of the design process. The best design (IMHO) is usually
    accomplished when you can get feedback from other fellow graphic designers.\r\n\r\nSo,
    as soon as you are ready to accept critiques, post'em!\r\n\r\n"
