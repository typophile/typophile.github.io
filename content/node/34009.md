body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : Paul Duensing</strong>\r\n\r\nPaul Hayden Duensing was
  a printer and typefounder who wrote extensively on his field. He sett up his press
  in Watkinsville, GA and was considered the dean of avocational typefounding in his
  time. He has so much knowledge of the status of the matrix holdings of the great
  foundries of Europe. He cut a 30 pt [[Civilite]] for [[Hermann Zapf]]. Without setting
  out to do so, he was one of the finest teachers in both the private press and avocational
  typefounding fields. In an act characteristic of his great generosity, he had in
  the last year of his life made gifts of his typefounding machines, matrices and
  effects to promising young people.\r\nDuensing passed the evening of November 9,
  2006 after a lengthy battle with ill health.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
