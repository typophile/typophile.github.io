body: "Any recommendations for books, websites, resources that teach Indesign, but
  offer more than simple a software manual (eg \"classroom in a book\")\r\n\r\nMany
  of the books I find seem to focus on the software itself rather than how to apply
  the software to solve design problems (not sure if that is clear exactly)...\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I am curious about peoples opinions on becoming Adobe certifed in PS/Illustrator/Indesign.
  \r\n\r\nA worthy investment in the sense of increasing ones hire-ability and/or
  increasing knowledge? (not necessarily the same thing)\r\n\r\nThanks, Malcolm\r\n"

    design problems is rather independent of software. \r\n\r\nI have [[http://www.amazon.com/InDesign-CS5-Macintosh-Windows-QuickStart/dp/0321705203/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1319414535&sr=8-1|This
    book]] which I use as a reference when I forget how to do something. The rest
    of it is something that you need to work at developing."

  body: "Becoming certified in any Adobe program or area is useful for one thing only:
    teaching that program. And even at that, most schools do not require certification.
    It may get you an interview, but like everything else in graphic design, it is
    your portfolio and experience that will get you a job. \r\n\r\nI wonder if being
    Adobe certified is even a requirement for working as a trainer at Adobe.\r\n\r\nDon"
