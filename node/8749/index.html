<div class=commentbody>Mark, asking us to guess which similar Mac fonts you might have is a bit difficult. Almost any commercial font is available in Mac & PC formats, it's 'freeware' that is often only available in one format. <br> <br>My suggestion is to search through the <a href=http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html target=_blank>Script Font ID Guide</a>, Parts 1, 2, 7 and 8, and see which fonts resemble Vladimir to your eye, and see if you have them in your collection.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You could also consider trying a different software for your font conversion. That is, I mean ::winking:: if you have the proper license. ;^}</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've had pretty good luck using FontAgent Pro on Mac OS X to use PC TTF fonts. This utility is produced by Insider Software. You just copy the font file over and use it directly; you don't need to convert it or anything. <br> <br>If you send me the font I can test it out for you. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/blush.gif border=0> Just kidding! Actually, I already have Vladimir. I don't need or want a pirated copy. <br> <br>Seriously, I recommend using FontAgent Pro since it avoids file conversion, and it seems to be able to use most PC TTF fonts directly.</div>

<div class=commentbody>As a die-hard OS 9 user, I was hoping there was someone who could eyeball the font and say, akin to Arial or Univers or Swiss, "Use Helvetica on the Mac." <br> <br>Once I have Quark OS X (on the way), these issues will go away--I assume I'll just use the PC font in its native .TTF file format. <br> <br>I always assumed this board was created so that designers wouldn't HAVE to use "the Script Font ID Guide, Parts 1, 2, 7 and 8, and see which fonts resemble Vladimir to your eye".</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well Mark, that suggestion was supposed to make it simpler for you use your OWN judgement about which fonts were similar enough to meet your needs, rather than have me guess. Those portions of the Guide are not big, and you only need to see related styles instead of looking at all scripts. <br> <br>Since you can't spare the time (unlike us, apparently), I would suggest Orion Script (on one of the Dover font CD's with Solotype fonts) or <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=206358" target=_blank>Saxony Script</a>, or else my original suggestion of buying the Mac version. <br> <br>Sorry to keep you waiting.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mark, I am quite disappointed by your stab at Mike. He has <br>proven time and again to go <i>way</i> beyond the call of duty in <br>order to identify a typeface. <br> <br>Sometimes it just isn't that easy or clear cut. You said yourself <br>that you wanted to use a font you already own. First problem - <br>we haven't got the faintest idea what you've got installed on <br>your machine. Second problem - a "similar looking font" is <br>open to interpretation when talking about scripts. There are <br>countless alternatives, and we don't know which specific <br>quality of Vladimir you want to see in that "similar looking <br>font". Third - if anyone would know that alternative, we'd <br>certainly tell you straight away instead of directing you to <br>the Script Font ID Guide. Fourth - if <i>you</i> don't want to invest <br>the time and effort in looking up something you fancy in a <br>nicely delimited selection, I don't see why would <i>we</i> need <br>to do that? <br> <br>I'll let it slide for once, but please remember next time that this <br>Board has helped you numerous times, and that everybody <br>here helps you on a voluntary basis. <i>No</i>body's getting paid <br>for all this, believe me. So please remain courteous.</div>
