    of checking with one Post Office saying my postcards were just fine then finding
    out at another one that the postcards were two small and I'd instead have to use
    envelopes for them all.\r\n\r\nAs for wedding standards, I don't think there really
    is one...they just adhere to standard greeting card/envelope sized.\r\n\r\n"

    is NOT mailable.\r\n\r\n2. Square invitations may look classy, but they'll cost
    you an extra 12\xA2 apiece to mail (non-standard surcharge).\r\n\r\nIf you have
    ANY questions. contact your local USPS BMEU (Business Mail Entry Unit) and request
    a FREE Notice 3A: Letter-size Mail DImensional Standards Template."
