    <BR>I think the TDC is the most prestigious annual competition, and having been
    a judge I can say that it tends to attract a generally high level of work, much
    of it from experienced and professional designers. Overall, the Morisawa prize
    was more presitigious for the winner -- and licrative --, but it wasn&#39;t annual
    and has now been cancelled. The most prestigious competition of recent years was
    probably ATypI&#39;s bukva:raz!, but that was a one-off.

  body: '{Hey, you knew it was coming...} <BR> <BR>Prestige? The number of entries
    to the TDC2 keeps falling year after year. So I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m
    being proven right: it has major flaws. In fact three of them: <BR>1&#41; The
    cost to enter is simply too high for too much of the world. As a result, proven
    hotbeds of type design talent &#40;like South America - just check out the Morisawa
    results&#41; get shut out, making the results of the competition less valid. The
    TDC needs to implement a variable fee based on country of origin, exactly like
    ATypI membership has now become. The way the TDC uses the word &#34;international&#34;
    is the way baseball uses &#34;world series&#34;... <BR>2&#41; The judging is too
    rushed &#40;one weekend!&#41;, and this results in the ever-present bad choices
    among the winners, discouraging entries. Every year there&#39;s at least one winner
    that the bulk of people agree was totally misguided. It&#39;s tempting to think
    that every competition has this problem, but really, in the case of the TDC it
    consistently seems to go too far. <BR>3&#41; The judging is too &#34;clubby&#34;.
    The TDC insists on flying the judges to and lodging the judges in friggin&#39;
    NYC. Total waste of money. <BR> <BR>The solution to #2 and #3 is exactly what
    Critique magazine did for their wonderful &#40;and free!&#41; competitions in
    the late 90s: screen the entries, weeding out the really bad stuff &#40;optional,
    actually&#41;; send the remaining entries to the judges, instead of the other
    way around; give the judges plenty of time, like a month. Since fonts are adequately
    shown in one color, on a flexible and flat surface, you would save a lot of money
    &#40;hence reduce fees&#41; by simply rolling up the 11x17 sheets and cascading
    them from one judge to the other. Or you could ask people to send five copies
    to speed things up. Or you could send groups of entries to each judge and get
    them rotating. And hey, do conference calls if you think interaction among judges
    is important. ANYTHING is better than donating money to the airlines and hotels.
    <BR> <BR>There are in fact other problems with the TDC competition, but they&#39;re
    not as bad as the three above. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Morisawa was super prestigious,
    and deservedly so - and it even allowed submission by emailed PDF! But yeah, it&#39;s
    over. Bukvaraz was wonderful, and another one would be even better &#40;it could
    allow itself to start looking forward rather than back&#41;. Then there&#39;s
    the Linotype contest, which is now giving out cash prizes &#40;although there
    are some strings attached&#41;. Note that all of them except the TDC are/were
    free. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>The ideal competition would have modest &#40;and country-sensitive&#41;
    entry fees, be held every 2-3 years, and give a choice to each winner of prize&#43;strings
    or just glory. <BR> <BR>&#62; what&#39;s up in France? <BR> <BR>Maybe there&#39;s
    a surcharge for entries from those damn anti-war frogs...  ;-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: The Linotype competition attracts -- and is designed to attract -- new designers.
    Having just judged the most recent one, I can say that there were very few entries
    from designers whose work I recognised, and there was a lot of work from students.
    In the TDC show, a lot of the work is already familiar, because major foundries
    enter the most recent additions to their libraries. <BR> <BR>I agree with Hrant
    that the TDC competition is expensive and that this discourages people from entering.
    It is even more expensive if you win, because you then have to pay a hanging fee
    and provide six copies of your work for the travelling exhibitions. One of the
    great things about the bukva:raz! competition is that it was free to enter and
    there were no hanging fees. But this was only possible with sponsorship from ATypI,
    underwritten to some extent by the advance from the <i>Language Culture Type</i>
    book from Graphis.

    <BR> <BR>Stubborn? Why because I don&#39;t agree with you. I have been listening
    to your suggestions on how to run a competition for 6 or 7 years now, and for
    the TDC, with our publishing deadline, the idea of sending work around the world
    to a set of judges so they can have as much time as they need, does not work.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve run your idea past judges of the competition, and all have had
    the same reaction... &#34;no way would I want all this stuff coming to my studio.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>You seem to think that a weekend is too short a time to judge. After
    every competition that I have been around, I have asked the judges if they felt
    they were rushed or needed more time. Every one that I have spoke to has answered
    the same way. They all felt they had plenty of time. <BR> <BR>Of the total number
    of entries, about half are dismissed by the judges in the first hour. So if you
    have 120 entries, 60 are gone. Of that next 60 half of those go in the next two
    hours. It doesn&#39;t take four people a month to decide on the remainder. <BR>
    <BR>All the judges have very clear ideas of what is good and what is not. The
    discussions are very lively, and I wish everyone could eavesdrop because it is
    a valuable experience. I remember Matthew Carter saying that if he was in town
    the year following his judging would it be alright if he came by to watch, because
    he felt it was such an enjoyable experience. <BR> <BR>Right there is another reason
    why it is important to have judges in the same place. They get something out of
    it as well. I think that bringing someone to NYC and putting up in a hotel for
    a couple of days is a small honorarium to pay in exchange for their expertise,
    and commitment. <BR> <BR>As to Kyle&#39;s question about Hanging Fees. No one
    has ever refused to pay them. Since the hanging fee requirement is spelled out
    in the competition rules, they come as no surprise. People whose work wins seem
    generally happy to abide by the rules they have accepted. Considering the cost
    of other avenues of advertising and marketing, I consider the hanging fee that
    covers the cost of being in the annual and the shows to be a bargain, considering
    the reach they give the work. <BR> <BR>If someone did refuse to pay I think it
    would be up to the circumstances. IF there were special circumstances involved
    then I think the club and the winner could come to some understanding. But if
    the person just refused to pay and offered no reason then I would take it in the
    same way as someone who tries to welch on a debt and they, most likely, would
    not be included at all. <BR> <BR>Every year when someone brings up the TDC Type
    Design Competition Hrant begins his litany of complaints. I have tried to explain
    the reason the competition is run the way it is. I have grown weary of doing this
    every year for the last 6 or 7 years. This is the last I will speak of it. If
    Hrant thinks he has the answers, I encourage him to start his own competition.
    It would lovely to see him actually act on his complaints. <BR> <BR> '

    of the competition <BR> <BR>That&#39;s good to hear. To me, trying is the most
    important thing. <BR> <BR>That said, I still think the TDC competition clearly
    has a good deal of room for improvement, and the declining participation -among
    a BOOM in the actual practice of designing type- seems to support that opinion.
    Another reason to think there&#39;s room for improvement is that other competitions
    have found better ways to do some aspects of the job. <BR> <BR>The idea about
    shipping the entries does have its drawbacks, I admit. But as for the fees, I
    think the least you can do is make it cheaper for people from non-affluent countries.
    Otherwise, &#34;For type designers around the world, the TDC2 is the premier annual
    event to honor the achievement of type designers everywhere&#34; is simply untrue.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; I consider the hanging fee that covers the cost of <BR>&#62; being
    in the annual and the shows to be a bargain <BR> <BR>That&#39;s fine, and I probably
    agree with you! But we shouldn&#39;t try to decide on behalf of other people.
    For one thing, somebody -possibly a talented designer- from South America for
    example &#40;it&#39;s clear they have many down there&#41; might already be overstretched
    with the entry fee. As I&#39;ve pointed out before, I&#39;m not complaining on
    my behalf: I can afford the entry pretty easily. What makes me complain is a desire
    to see the results of the competition become more relevant, and become more of
    a reward-system for everybody with talent and dedication, not just rich people.
    <BR> <BR>So if somebody only wants to have won, and doesn&#39;t want to pay extra
    for shows or being in the annual, I think you should try to accomodate that, instead
    of putting designers on the spot with an agreement they might find too commital.
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, these days I only complain about the TDC competition
    when somebody else brings it up. And I complain because it makes me sad to see
    wasted potential, that&#39;s all. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    body were coming to a decision <BR> <BR>Yes, this is admittedly valid - I for
    one am a big fan of communication. But: <BR>1&#41; It&#39;s just another factor
    that has to be balanced. If the cost of getting the judges together is preventing
    meaningful competition results, then maybe it should be tossed? Or here&#39;s
    an idea: don&#39;t use one of the world&#39;s most expensive cities to host the
    thing! And here&#39;s another: do the judging where type people are going to congregate
    anyway, like at TypeCon. <BR>2&#41; It doesn&#39;t preclude doing part of the
    judging remotely/individually. There might even be an advantage to having a hybrid
    method, so judges can think both individually and with the benefit of the others
    - different people think better in different circumstances. So you could send
    copies of the entries to the judges, give them a week or two to build some preferences
    and pro/con arguments, then get everybody together to nail down the winners. In
    this way you have the communication, the shmoozing, and the better results too,
    without spending more &#40;like you could make the final stage one day instead
    of two&#41;. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s so much room for some nimble, intelligent improvement,
    instead of this seemingly monolithic and exclusionary thing we have now, I&#39;m
    just surprised that the TDC competition doesn&#39;t seem to be adapting, even
    though the drop in participation is the strongest possible warning signal. <BR>

  body: Actually the entry fees are affordable and the hanging fees are not so expensive
    considering that the price of a family and superfamly only represent a small proportional
    rise. Anyway some designer could find himself in trouble to cover the fees so
    it would be fine to have a special clause; maybe the hanging fee could be covered
    by the first typeface sales.
