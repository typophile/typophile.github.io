  but haven't participated in discussions. I've learned much and have enjoyed all
  of it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, i've been tasked with creating a vector version of a logo
  and the company doesn't know what font was used. I'm sure it's a no brainer but
  I have looked without luck. \r\n\r\nApologies for the blurry photo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/identifont_5656.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions? Many thanks, LW."
