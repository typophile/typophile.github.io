body: "It's kinda like the Hobo g but the typeface is a cursive serif. Can anyone
  think of a font that has this kinda g?\r\nI'm not sure if my description is accurate
  someone else saw and described it to me!\r\nSo if you guys can think of anything
  that's even remotely similar to the description above please let me know!"

  body: "I can only think of a few serifs with a 'reversed tail' on the g. One is
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/jones/|Jones]] from T-26; another is [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=272992&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=19997&query=AITOS&SCOPE=Fonts|Aitos]],
    from Monotype; and the last I can think of is from Unifonts, and I would have
    to look for the name.\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Condensed]]. Oddly the normal width Every doesn't have that 'g'.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Oh thank you very very much. This is very much appreciated. It's an odd feature
    but it was a little harder than I thought to find.\r\nEvery Condensed has really
    nice letterforms and feel (regardless of the g). But the book version seems more
    like a titling and the regular like a book. Anyway I hope I'll find a way to use
    it for titles some day."
