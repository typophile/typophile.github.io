  have just taken over a workshop space here in East London, and I am now doing a
  bit of research on the building and its story.\r\n\r\nI especially find the building
  signage of high interest, but I have no idea when it is from or what font they have
  used (I am quite sure the signs are later than the building though).\r\n\r\nSo -
  does any of you have an idea of what this font could be?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/SunburyWorkshops.jpg\"
