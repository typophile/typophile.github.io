  body: I have tried out Mrs Eaves Petite &#43; small caps - both seem a bit lightweight
    - I am wondering if there is a &#39;medium&#39; baskerville with small caps...
    <BR> <BR>thnks

  body: If I stroke Mrs Eaves small caps slightly it looks spot on...

  body: Yes, Matthew. I know it&#39;s a little bit lighter, but the general proportions
    are so similar that I think it&#39;s a screen artifact, perhaps Photoshop rasterization...
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;d been trying some Baskervilles but they didn&#39;t match. <BR>

  body: I&#39;m with Jose. Looks like Mrs. Eaves. That C is a dead give away, none
    of the Baskervilles I can find have such pronounced serifs.
