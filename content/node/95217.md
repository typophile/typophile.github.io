  from the LEDish look of typefaces seen in late 70's scifi movies. I penned versions
  of this in my undergrad days and wanted to commit something to digital form.. and
  open type/webfont it. Unfortunately, I was working more or less in a vacuum before
  finding you. I'll do my best to adjust it based on your comments and criticism.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scifi78-full_5746.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scifi78_4224.png]\r\n\r\nThe

  in advance.\r\nCheers,\r\nTim"

  body: 'Sorry to be brutally honest, but I''ve rarely seen anything so bad. That
    doesn''t say 70''s scifi to me, it just looks incredibly poorly executed and extremely
    amateurish. Examine lots of typefaces, look at proportions, think about it for
    a long time then start again, but with smaller ascenders and descenders. There
    really is no point critiquing this version as there is so much wrong here. '

    it wouldn't be fruitful to critique details; however it's still possible to help
    by providing guidance in terms of overall technical issues, by pointing out good
    precedents in this genre, and by trying to figure out how this effort can stand
    out (where for example the long extenders might actually make sense).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
