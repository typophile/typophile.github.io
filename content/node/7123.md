  body: That typeface is Trooper Roman. <BR>There is a digitized version from Paratype
    called <a href="http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Troover.htm" target=_top>Troover
    Roman</a>. Watch out, the &#34;y&#34; and &#34;g&#34; of your sample are alternates
    characters, and Troover looks that has them &#40;228, 243&#41;. <BR>There is another
    Bitstream&#39;s font called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-toms-roman/"
    target=_top>Tom&#39;s Roman</a> &#34;sharing the style of Trooper&#34; but to
    me doesn&#39;t look as close as Troover.

  body: Thank you! Troover Roman is the exact match. <BR>There is also a font called
    Trooper Roman available from CastleType, <a href="http://www.castletype.com/browse_classic.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.castletype.com/browse_classic.html</a> - but it is
    not the condensed version which trades under the name Troover by ParaType. <BR>Very
    interesting indeed. I had a hunch that this font might be designed by Tom Carnase,
    who designed Tom&#39;s Roman. I have not found any information anywhere as to
    who designed it originally. Any clues?

  body: Also, <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm">Quick brown Fox</a> has this face
    in multiple weights as &#39;Toledo&#39; in their &#39;SERIALS Typecollection&#39;.
    I&#39;m not sure about the quality, or whether the fonts contain the alternate
    &#39;O&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, and &#39;y&#39;.

  body: Thanks for the information, - most interesting. - <BR>This foundry, <a href="http://www.qbf.de"
    target="_blank">www.qbf.de</a>, seems very dodgy. Full of cheap knock-off fonts,
    with ugly obliqued versions. Looks on the wrong side of the legal/illegal borderline
    to me?

  body: Dodgy, yes, but they&#39;re the only digital source I know of for lighter
    weights of Trooper Roman, as well as a few other oddball faces -- they have versions
    of Tabasco and Blippo Bold, for instance.

  body: Has anyone ordered anything recently from Quick Brown Fox? Their site looks
    ancient, and Safari seems to think the security certificate of their credit card
    processing service has expired.
