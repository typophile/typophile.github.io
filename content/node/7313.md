    many digital fonts using Bradbury Thompson&#39;s <a href="http://www.pbtweb.com/alpha26/alpha.htm"

    target="_blank"> Bodoni 26</a> stays true to the  <BR>original, while Zuzana Licko&#39;s

    target="_blank">&#39;Panoptica&#39;</a>, but the &#39;e&#39; &amp; &#39;R&#39;
    are not styled like this. <BR> <BR>I think I have seen more unicase fonts, but
    MyFonts isn&#39;t very helpful in this situation.

  body: 'I don&#39;t think it was designed by an especially competent type <BR>designer,
    but rather a graphic artist with an interesting idea. <BR>Among many problems:
    <BR>- the second peak of the &#39;m&#39; is shorter than the first <BR>- the &#39;R&#39;
    tail is too light <BR> <BR>If you like the ball terminals, have a look at <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&amp;c=4&amp;p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=ALT0000117"
