  that It's a typeface and not a custom script. I'm extremely interested in using
  this font. Any help is much appreciated."

    list them. Carpenter is good but it lacks the detail I think '

  body: "Definitely not a font. It's quite lovely, though.\r\n\r\nThere don't seem
    to be a great deal of script fonts around that approximate this \"texture\" of
    handwriting, if you like. Blambot's After Dark BB (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/blambot/after-dark-bb/)
    has big caps and a small, delicate lowercase, but is quite scrappy and not as
    elegant as your example. There's always something like Johann Sparkling (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/johann-sparkling/),
    which is quite open but more oblique and swooshy than After Dark.\r\n\r\nHere
    are a few more suggestions:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/petras-script/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/arabesque/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/sudestada-basic/\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    get a pen and start writing!\r\n\r\n-NJ"
