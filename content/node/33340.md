  to these ones:\r\nScreen Matrix, Knit map and Folk art.\r\nI would like it to be
  more neutral then folk art but more gentle and delicate then Screen Matrix.\r\nDo
  you have any suggestions that might help me?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_nelio/\">FF
    Nelio</a> might not be what you're looking for, but they are others in this elegant
    pixel genre.\r\n\r\nYou might also like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_screenstar/\">FF
    Screenstar</a> which is a simple pixel sans, but a tad more style than FF Screen
    Matrix.\r\n\r\nNick Shinn's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/shinntype/panoptica_pixel/\">Panoptica</a>
    is also very interesting and <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=unibody&id2=overview\">Unibody</a>
    is without doubt the finest free pixel family."

    out the pixels is the lowest form of pixelfont; it causes (at least) two  problems,
    plus it makes the font unnecessarily large in K. As for the Italic, the real problem
    I guess is simply pretending it is one. If they had called it Cursive then I would
    have no issue, since users would know what it's not.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    should I smell a rat? I first saw it merely as a design affectation but now I
    can see what you're saying about the ductus of the bold y, v and w. Would I be
    right in saying that the Ductal Logic hasn't been consistently applied to the
