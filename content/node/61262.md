  body: I find the I a little bit distracting when reading. Eye keeps jumping back
    to it. Not a criticism at all, just comment. Really do like the face.

  body: "I kinda like the rough-hewn feel of this. \r\nThe \"S\" might be a hint too
    strange and curly \u2013 it's leaning right, and looks bottom-heavy. \r\nFrankly
    I think the \"I\" is gimmicky. I'd see that in a logo or such \u2013 to make a
    mark \u2013 but <em>every</em> \"I\" being sheared like that is a bit much to
    my eye. Or is there a specific reason why you'd want to emphasize the \"I\"s?"

  body: "Not to mention that when I've seen that shape used in like typefaces it is
    used as a one, not an i.\r\nThat C terminal may be too weird, too - it's hard
    to work individualistic, quirky details into such an otherwise regular and familiar
    kind of font."

  body: "Thanks for your comments.  Here is an image of the logo with the typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cr_lockup_6726.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo,
    the letter i is, for the most part, a signification of the meaning behind the
    creation of the typeface.  I thought, to describe a community and to describe
    those communities as \"rising\" is somewhat of an obvious and vague name for the
    organization.  But a community is made up of a group of individuals.  When you
    refer to yourself as an individual you use 'I'.  Individuals in a circle make
    up that community and are unified, and also indicative of a sun, that rises.\r\n\r\nI
    think that this concept works well with the logo and the feeling of the typeface
    is right, and the letterforms are unique enough that an emphasis on the I's makes
    sense, but I really think that the metaphor holds up mostly in the lock-up. I
    also agree that maybe working too individualistically and trying to make some
    letters individuals is taking away from the face.  But then why not use DIN or
    Knockout or any other similar font that has been used for a wide variety of applications?
    Maybe less of an angle for the rest of the typeface?\r\n"
