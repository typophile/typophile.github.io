  weekend; does anyone know to which face it belongs? I think it's quite recent and
  it looks a bit like this[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_5228.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions appreciated"

    it: Monotype Script and Patria (although there must be others). So I'd also like
    to find out what font this is!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    but with the top open. This one is \"missing\" the projection from the  bowl coming
    out of the diagonal at the bottom-right.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Cheers Hrant. It's that missing projection that I found most intriguing, because
    structurally there is now no way to trace this form back to 'et'.  If I find the
    (rest of the) ad I'll post the ampersand in context of the rest of the setting.
