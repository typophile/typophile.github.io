    \u05D0\u05DE\u05E0\u05D5\u05EA\u05D9 \u05E2\u05D1\u05E8\u05D9\r\nand from copying
    Hebrew texts that I admired.\r\nI guess the book is out of print but there are
    many references to it on\r\nIsraeli web pages.\r\nThe book has alphabets with
    small arrows suggesting a stroke order.\r\n\r\nHowever no one can answer your
    question with any confidence without knowing\r\nthe purpose of the calligraphy!
    Do you want to learn \"Stam\", \"Yerusalmi\" etc\r\nThere are so many styles...\r\n\r\nMike"

    have classes on Hebrew script they will know who will. \r\n\r\nAnother route:
    google \"ketubah new york city\" or \"ketubot new york city\r\n\r\nI think the
    Ketubah (decorative marriage contract) is an important part of business for a
    lot of Hebrew calligraphers. So you can ask these people. \r\n\r\nAnother way:
    google  \"scribe sofer new york city\" that will get you the Torah scribes. "

  body: "I have an aunt in Jerusalem who maintains that Toby's book is the only one
    worth reading. I've actually found and ordered a used copy (even though it's online,
    it's awfully nice to have physical books). As to style\u2014the traditionalist
    in me is tempted by Stam, but my main goal is to have a good foundation in lettering
    and alphabet \"anatomy\" to aid in designing contemporary Hebrew type, so something
    closer to modern Hebrew scripts might be better. \r\n\r\nDespite growing up in
    Israel, I didn't get into typography until grad school in New York. My understanding
    of the Hebrew alphabet is scarcely better than a layman's, having read some essays
    (Raphael Frank's and others) and done some analysis of my own on readability and
    letterforms. Learning lettering in school was a great preparation for working
    with Latin type, and I'm sure it will be as effective for Hebrew. And as much
    as books are nice, I learn best from direct experience with another person.\r\n\r\nThank
    you all for the advice, in any case! I probably need to do some more research
    into the styles of Hebrew calligraphy before I seek out a teacher. "
