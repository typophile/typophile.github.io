  Logo"> <BR> <BR>So I saw this dilapidated graphic on top of an RV and was wondering
  what the font was? The company has since changed their logo, I guess this was only
  used during the late 80&#39;s very early 90&#39;s and finding another example was
  difficult, but I pinned it under the photo. Any clues for what it could be or what
  it is based off of?
