    or Richmond to me."

  body: "I'd have to go with Aaron on Richmond as the curvature on the inside of the
    S' match near perfectly. Also the point where the 'K' collides with the line to
    the left of it doesn't really look like the 'K' in the font family Futura,though
    it's just my opinion,you can try it out for yourself to compare. \r\n\r\nFutura

    asking.

  body: "Here's the original:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temp1_6324.gif]\r\n\r\nHere's
    Richmond Medium Italic, sheared and smushed into compliance:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temp2_6742.gif]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's a 50/50 opacity, with the original in red and Richmond in blue:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temp3_4265.gif]\r\n\r\nA
    few things: The top tails of the s's just aren't from the same letter. The bottom
    curves of the s's are very different weights. And while the verticals on the A's
    are the same weight, the diagonals on the A's and k's aren't. (All the letters
    were distorted equally.) I tried distorting just the Richmond k to get it to the
    right weight, but then the \"<\" was much too far to the right and too severely
    angled."
