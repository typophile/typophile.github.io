  Kodachome logo is? If not exactly (as it might be custom) something that is close?
  Knockout and Nobel are pretty similar, but looking for something closer still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think it's likely that it was custom hand-drawn lettering. \r\n\r\nNotice
    how the \"A\" tucks under the \"D\" and \"C\". It's possible to do this in metal
    type with kerns (elements that extend beyond the edges type body into the body
    of adjacent letters), but not practical to have them on these particular letters.
    They would crash too often with other common letter combinations, requiring extra
    spacing material to be added between the letters.\r\n\r\nWith lettering, tight
    spacing like this would not be an issue. \r\n\r\nAlso note that the two \"O\"s
    are not quite the same, another indication that it was hand-drawn."

  body: Great answer from Mark. There are elements of this lettering style in <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/modified-gothic/?refby=typographica">Modified
    Gothic</a> and Mark's own <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova/?refby=typographica">Mostra</a>.

  body: "Thanks guys! Mostra looks pretty close, and I think I can modify it for what
    I'm working on (as it's for a logo, and doesn't need to be typeable).\r\n\r\nI
    appreciate the help!"
