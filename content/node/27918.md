    for SC figures, but you can write the small caps features so that if the number
    default is lining fuigures, and you turn on a small caps feature, the numbers
    will switch to SC figures when the letters switch to small caps."

  body: i would agree with Dan and say with the lowercase as they are more correctly
    referred to as [[text figures]] with the assumption being that they are to be
    used in running text with the lower case. i also agree that if your smallcaps
    are taller, having a set of small cap figures would be useful. perhaps [[hybrid
    figures]] could be designed to work with the small caps?

  body: It depends on the design, e.g. how much lowercase and smallcaps height differ.
    Sometimes, lowercase height osf look a bit small, so smallcaps height is not too
    bad, at the same time they work with small caps. Making a special set of small
    caps numerals of course is nice too, but there are already so many numerals to
    do ...

    style numbers. If the typeface has a small x-height you'll probably want to go
    a bit highter and vice versa.

  body: "Another important question is the height (meaning vertical size, not position)
    of 3 5 7 9 and 6 8. Most designers simply shift cap-height numerals down to get
    the oldstyle 3 5 7 9. However, depending on the typeface they can be too tall
    and might descend even further than the descenders, which just looks wrong. This
    is a mistake seen quite frequently.\r\n\r\nAs a second step, I would always adjust
    (decrease) the size of 3 5 7 9. As a result, 6 and 8 also have to become smaller,
    making them smaller than the lining numbers. \r\n\r\nMyriad and Minion are two
    examples where this is done particularly well."

    propose that the logical disposition is to connect the \"Small Caps\" menu choice

    used in text with U&lc -- whereas \"All Small Caps\" would bring up lining, proportional,
    small-cap height figures.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps \"Small Caps\" should have no special
    provision for figures, but just leave the default or whatever other figure style
    is applied to the text.\r\n\r\nBut \"All Small Caps\" should definitely have lining,
    proportional figures, for use in places like a page folio, or in very small captions
    -- as a sort of optically scaled all-caps setting.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nBack to the
    thread: my preference, where small caps are significantly larger than x-height,
    is for OSF with an \"x-height\" that matches small cap height. Otherwise things
    like postal codes will look scrappy; the proviso is that the form of \"zero\"
    be different than lower case \"o\"."

    proliferating figures to match every situation, then the lining figs should be
    cap height. You wouldn't need any 3/4 height figs. \r\n\r\nIn general, my answer
    to your original question is \"x-height or lowercase\", for the reasons named
    above. They are meant for use with lc, and they have extenders, which increases
    their apparent size, so they don't need to be as big as small caps. But I agree,
    \ if the lc is very tiny compared to SC then the osfs should be somewhere in the
    middle where they would work with both, or else make a set for every single alphabet.
    Keep in mind, though, figures aren't read like words, and they only need to blend
    into text so much, whatever height. \r\n\r\nThis could become its own unhealthy
    obsession, however. Or at least delay your typeface release by months. \"I've

    other threads at Typophile pointed me in this direction, in particular one in
    which the need for tabular small-cap-height lining \uFB01gures was convincingly
    argued, with layouts shown. However, I do vary the \uFB01gure sets according to
    the typeface.\r\n\r\n<em>If the lining figures are not cap height, and you\u2019re

    301 samples show, three-quarter \uFB01gures (whether lining or ranging) are an
    alternative to old-style \uFB01gures in a mixed-case setting. IMO both are required,
    as they cater to two distinct preferences amongst typographers (and their clients).\r\n\r\nTwo
    sets of lining \uFB01gures are particularly necessary for grotesque faces, where
    the default \uFB01gure style is lining. For these faces, three-quarter \uFB01gures
    have always been a compromise: lining to sort-of match capitals and weighted to
    match lower case, but with height too short and stem width too thin for all-cap
    settings. \r\n\r\nHence this solution (Figgins Sans):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kp1928_3499.png]\r\nThere
    are three kinds of lining \uFB01gures:\r\n<ul> <li>Cap-height lining \uFB01gures,
    with upper-case stem thickness, for use in all-caps text</li> <li>Three-quarter
    lining \uFB01gures, with lower-case stem thickness, for use in U&lc text</li>
    </li><li>Small-cap-height lining \uFB01gures, with small-cap stem thickness, and
    wider proportions, for use in all-small-cap text (c2sc feature)</li>"
