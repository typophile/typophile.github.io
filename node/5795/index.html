		<div class="commentbody">Interesting to see Eclat mentioned. I had dinner with its designer, <BR>Doyald Young, at TypeCon a few days ago, during which I asked <BR>why more of his beautiful letters and scripts aren&#39;t digitized. His <BR>main frustration &#40;and this shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise to anyone here&#41;  <BR>is that he sees his fonts used all the time but he rarely sees any  <BR>royalties.

		<div class="commentbody">I have some familiarity with the work of the Eclat-lookalike font designer &#40;one more edit is needed to get rid of all the places it showed up, by the way&#41;. I&#39;d be a bit reluctant to accuse him of stealing Doyald&#39;s design, because I think they may both have used some old Art Deco -era books from the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s as their inspiration. Many of the other fonts that Mr. N. C. has done have been digitizations of other authentic typefaces from that era. In fact that time period, as we know, seems to be in vogue again, and many foundries have revivals of old typefaces.  <BR> <BR>Stephen, does Doyald say that the Eclat design is his original creation?</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><i>Doyald Young asked me to post the following:</i> <BR> <BR>Eclat references sports scripts, the kind commonly seen for baseball teams. <BR> <BR>I did not draw from a model, remember I&#39;ve taught scripts to students at Art Center for 27 years. The style has been around for a hundred years or more though not in the same exact shapes - look in the Encyclopaedia of Types for a review of metal scripts. I saw the style with commercial possibilities, not a free style as in many casual or brush scripts, but formal, simple, and robust shapes - as bold as I could draw the forms while still holding legibility. Many of the sports scripts were drawn with scant finesse, and for commercial use, I thought that more attention to detail was needed.  <BR> <BR>Bold scripts can&#39;t lean much and heavy connecting strokes pose a problem, because the bolder their shape, the lower the join must be near the baseline, and this lessens readability. In my book <a href="http://delphipress.com/">Logotypes and Letterforms</a> I devote a double spread to its history of Eclat in the Scripts chapter. I show a logo, Shu Uemura that borrows some of these features whose thins are what I strived for. <BR> <BR>Eclat&#39;s joins were modified slightly from my art when Letraset cut the Rubyliths in 1985, ITC digitized it in 1992. Fonts with tight fit always pose problems. More alternate letters are needed, though when Letraset agreed to include the font in their library, their finished art cut-off date was tight and I didn&#39;t have time to add them. Also, in my book <a href="http://delphipress.com/">Fonts &amp; Logos</a> I show a bold, narrow script that I called &#39;Bold Condensed Script&#39; and now have renamed it &#39;Home Run Script.&#39; <BR> <BR>Plagiarism is a threat in all fields of design. It takes time and money to combat it. A Chicago foundry ripped off my ITC Young Baroque font, calling it Yves. Plagiarism lessens our design impulse, since the courts wont license a design, only the code, a bizarre ruling. And so it goes. Plagiarism and &#39;designed in the manner of&#39; are two different issues and type foundries have a history of doing the later. A cursory look at Frank Merriman&#39;s wonderful A Type Comparison Book illustrates the point. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not fond of the name Eclat, which means a dazzling effect, brilliance. It also is synonymous with fame. I preferred Elan, but that name was taken and Letraset offered Eclat, I couldn&#39;t think of a better name so I said yes.  <BR> <BR>I see Eclat used for food products; French&#39;s mustard uses it for the word &#39;Classic&#39; on the label, though they&#39;ve modified the cap C. A local Latino TV station here in Los Angeles boldly uses the font on the Metro Bus signs, Adobe has used it for their print ad headlines, and an Israeli airline has chosen it for their logo.</div>
