<p>Hey Ryan! Our goal is to make high-quality commercial fonts more accessible to the average consumer. If that means including a free order of chicken wings with every font, then fire up the oven and break out the barbecue sauce! FontSlice will be the first digital type distributor to significantly lower the average transaction cost of a font without devaluing the font itself. We think FontSlice will allow a whole lot more people to enter the wide world of type — and that <em>would</em> be revolutionary.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Great questions Jackson. I hope the following helps.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Jackson: </strong>Does your iTunes model mean you only take 30% commission?</blockquote>
<p>Our commission <em>can</em> be as low as 30%, but the exact percentage will depend on a number of factors, such as the level of exclusivity (there will be three) and whether or not the font is being actively promoted. We also realize that there&rsquo;s probably not a one-size-fits-all distribution agreement, so we plan on working with each foundry individually to come to an agreement that works for both parties. We want to treat our foundries like royalty, even if that means hiring more employees to handle all of our accounts.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Jackson: </strong>How would this work with modern fonts (i.e.: OT Kerning and OpenType features)? What about version control, particularly with customers who need to share documents?</blockquote>
<p>It took months of careful programming to create the algorithm that produces abridged font files. In a nutshell, the algorithm analyzes each line of the original font file and determines what type of information it contains. The algorithm won&rsquo;t even consider altering the line unless it contains spline data, which is the only data within a font file that is absolutely necessary to reproduce the shape of a particular glyph. If a user has rights to a certain glyph, then the spline data is left untouched. If a user doesn&rsquo;t have rights to a certain glyph, then the spline data is removed. All other information (including kerning and OpenType data) is left untouched. As long as the user has rights to the necessary glyphs, all OpenType functionality will remain intact. The abridged font is identical in every way to the original file, save the missing spline data for unlicensed glyphs. This means that version control would be handled the same way it is now.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Jackson: </strong>Have you done any research that suggests there are enough customers setting only headlines for this model to make any money for a foundry partner?</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that FontSlice will be <em>most</em> useful to users that are typesetting display copy. However, assuming a user is able to predict which character ranges would be required for a particular application, there&rsquo;s no reason why FontSlice wouldn&rsquo;t be used for larger amounts of text. We also believe that users will prefer to consolidate their font property in one place, whether they&rsquo;re buying abridged or unabridged fonts.</p>

<p>Nick, you&rsquo;re absolutely right. The intent of FontSlice is not to <em>replace</em> the current model, but rather to <em>supplement</em> it with an additional revenue stream. FontSlice will be the gateway drug for people who might otherwise stick to free fonts.</div>

<p>Your right Brian. Its really only necessary to include hinting, metrics, and OpenType information for purchased glyphs. The upside of this technique is that it would result in smaller font files. The downside is that it would take a bit more processing power since the algorithm would need to make a few more decisions about what information to include or omit. It&rsquo;s not clear at this point which method is more advantageous on a large-scale platform, and we may choose to alter the algorithm after we gather server statistics for the first few months. In any case, the end result will be the same: a fully-functioning abridged font that is otherwise identical to the original file.</div>

<p>How would the average user go about dealing with multiple variations of the same font?</blockquote></p>
<p>Hey James. Great question. This was actually one of the tests we performed in our testing phase. We wanted to make sure users could easily upgrade an abridged font without too much hassle. To the operating system, two different abridged versions of the same font will appear to be identical. Thus, when you install the upgraded version, it will overwrite the older version. Some software applications will need to be restarted before they will recognize the upgraded font, but this is the case when installing any new font, abridged or not.</p>

<p>which would be true, if all the hinting information was stored in each glyph. But True Type hints (of any value) reference control values stored in the cvt table, meaning you need to parse the CVT to decide what parts you want to keep? And then adjust later if they buy more letters?</p>
<p>And what if I buy a font with no accented characters, are the vertical metrics set for that &ldquo;font&rdquo;&rsquo;s tallest glyphs? But then I come back later and buy a capital A+ring, does the font&rsquo;s vertical metrics change for the new taller glyph? That would respace my documents created using the font.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, as the skeptics already have spoken (consider me one too), I’ll play the devil’s advocate here and picture a scenario where this kind of service might be of benefit:</p>
<p>As a graphic design studio, we receive a number of logotype files from different institutions/companies, to include them in some brochure or poster. Dealing with graphic laymen, the problem is that these files aren’t fit for print: pixelated GIF, embedded DOC, you name it. Very often, this is about a few characters only, from an easily identifiable and common typeface, without any modifications. It would be a matter of minutes to download the font and re-set the damn line. We don’t do that, because we don’t want to spend money on lame ‘classic’ fonts that we don’t like, and won’t ever need again. I prefer spending money on good fonts.</p>
<p>So, what to do? Lose hours of time trying to reach someone who can send us a good file? No, that’s hopeless (“But I already sent you our logo twice!”, “Just grab it from our website! It’s on the top left.” “Speak to our IT guy. He’s back next week.”). Simply send the crappy files to the printer and not care? Hardly.</p>
<p>This may sound far-fetched, but it happens all the time. In these cases, I wish for a pay-by-the-letter service. As a workaround. The critical points raised (versions, kerning, OT features, hinting) all hardly apply.</p>
<p>I doubt that this is enough to build a business model on. But maybe the target group of FontSlice is not us professionals, anyway?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote><strong>Florian Hardwig: </strong>As a graphic design studio, we receive a number of logotype files from different institutions/companies, to include them in some brochure or poster. Dealing with graphic laymen, the problem is that these files aren’t fit for print: pixelated GIF, embedded DOC, you name it. Very often, this is about a few characters only, from an easily identifiable and common typeface, without any modifications. It would be a matter of minutes to download the font and re-set the damn line. We don’t do that, because we don’t want to spend money on lame ‘classic’ fonts that we don’t like, and won’t ever need again. I prefer spending money on good fonts.
<p>So, what to do? Lose hours of time trying to reach someone who can send us a good file? No, that’s hopeless (“But I already sent you our logo twice!”, “Just grab it from our website! It’s on the top left.” “Speak to our IT guy. He’s back next week.”). Simply send the crappy files to the printer and not care? Hardly.</p>
<p>This may sound far-fetched, but it happens all the time. In these cases, I wish for a pay-by-the-letter service. As a workaround. The critical points raised (versions, kerning, OT features, hinting) all hardly apply.</p>
<p>I doubt that this is enough to build a business model on. But maybe the target group of FontSlice is not us professionals, anyway?</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><strong>daverowland: </strong>Yes as part of my old day job I had to vectorise loads of crappy pixelated logos. If we didn't have the font, it was often way more cost effective to trace the characters needed (it's what got me into making fonts in the first place) than buy the font. In this situation a pay-by-glyph system would be useful.</blockquote>
<p>You both bring up a good point. The problem of vectorizing old logos is certainly one of the many applications of FontSlice. In this case, the underlying problem is that your limited usage of an asset doesn&rsquo;t justify the cost. This argument could be made whether you&rsquo;re designing logos or any variety of other media, such as advertisements, blog headers, brochures, covers, invitations, or posters; all of these applications may only require a small subset of glyphs. Of course, if you only purchase &lsquo;good&rsquo; fonts, then you can use them time and again, but fonts are often chosen for specific projects and designers may not want to commit to a font if they&rsquo;re unsure how useful it will be to them in the future. FontSlice lowers that initial barrier to consumption and allows the user to make this commitment over time. While professional designers are certainly a part of the target market, I believe FontSlice will attract people who previously may have never even considered paying for a font.</p>

<p>And what if I buy a font with no accented characters, are the vertical metrics set for that &ldquo;font&rdquo;&rsquo;s tallest glyphs? But then I come back later and buy a capital A+ring, does the font&rsquo;s vertical metrics change for the new taller glyph? That would respace my documents created using the font.</blockquote></p>
<p>Hey Jason. These are very valid concerns and things that we&rsquo;ve considered as well. In my response to Jackson&rsquo;s second question, I explained a bit about how the algorithm works. Basically, the information within the font file will remain perfectly intact, except that the spline data for unlicensed glyphs will be removed (metric information will be left untouched). This means that designers will not be required to re-adjust text positioning after upgrading an abridged font.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The “designer fonts” with which you intend to populate your site seem to have been left to the last minute, as if the product, in contradiction, is generic.</p>
<p>In my experience there are two models a new distributor can adopt: either a small, select, carefully curated group of typefaces—or a large enough volume of common styles in which keyword searching can come into play.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst option grows into the second over time.</p>
<p>For instance, when Apple launched DTP, part of its success was having Helvetica and Times bundled with the LaserWriter software: instant cred.</p>
<p>Recently, Google has launched its web fonts site, with the emphasis on the functionality of the site as a design tool, and the functionality of the font formats and licensing model, but has been <a href="http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/?page_id=3207">criticized</a> for the overall quality of the fonts available. Nonetheless, its fonts are being used; because Google is massive, a beneﬁt you don’t have.</p>
<p>I would suggest you either solicit particular foundries with product that you think will give you a distinct design proﬁle to match and complement your business model (curation option), or approach a foundry/publisher which can provide you with a large collection that spans the major type categories.</p>
<p>Actively seeking speciﬁc content would, in my opinion, be better than just saying “open for business” and taking what comes.</p>

<p>I definitely see where you&rsquo;re coming from, but I do believe the mass appeal is there. If you look through the top 100 most-downloaded fonts of all time on dafont.com (a free font website), you&rsquo;ll find that most of these fonts are downloaded hundreds or thousands of times <em>per day</em>. You&rsquo;ll also notice that nearly every font in that list is a display font (very few would actually work for body text). The font market is <em>massive</em>, but I don&rsquo;t believe its currently in equilibrium; consumers can either pay $25 or $0 with very little in-between. FontSlice offers a simple model for bringing the market into equilibrium. People who may have never paid for a font before might be able to justify paying a dollar or two for a font through FontSlice. This will acclimate consumers to the idea of paying for high-quality fonts in general, which may expand the market even further.</div>

For the people who usually use Dafont or Google Webfonts you need to offer something special, which these sites don&rsquo;t have in order to have people pay for your fonts. 
For the scenario of &ldquo;recreating logotypes&rdquo; you need to have all the classics from Monotype/Linotype first or it won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>From my foundry&rsquo;s point of view: If people can buy my fonts for a fraction of the regular price they pay at MyFonts, then your service would need to license a lot more of these subsetted fonts – otherwise I won&rsquo;t be too interested in participating.</p>

<p>there are 300,000 free, 80,000 commercial, 400,000 floating on the web and 5,000 or so people offering custom fonts, fonts &amp; fonts. I think, and there’s plenty of evidence to back it up, that $25-$40 for great commercial fonts is not a barrier for someone who wants to pay something; while 15¢-$1.00 is too much of a barrier for someone who doesn’t want to pay anything.</p>
<p>technically this model is not a big deal for those who serve subset fonts to speed their way along the web.

<p>Great question. The price for an unabridged font is established by the foundry. In most cases, it will be the same price as MyFonts and other distributors. When a user makes a purchase, the price is calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/formula_5691.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>PF = The price of the unabridged font (set by the foundry)
GO = The number of old glyphs (purchased by the user in the past)
GN = The number of new glyphs (not yet purchased by the user)
GT = The total number of glyphs in the font
b = The sharpness of the pricing curve (normally set to 2)</p>
<p>Note that if the user purchases all glyphs in the first purchase, then GO must equal zero and GN must equal GT. Thus, the formula reduces to PF (the price of the unabridged font set by the foundry).</p>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.</p>

<p>You make a fair point Riccardo. Our pricing model does assume that each glyph represents an equal amount of effort, which is certainly an oversimplification. We realize that some characters require a great deal more effort than others. For example, building an accented character takes far less time than designing the components that it references. When we were designing our pricing model, we considered adding terms that would account for these different levels of complexity. In the end, however, we decided that the addition of such complexity would breed further complexity. We didn&rsquo;t want to end up with something akin to the U.S. tax code, so we decided to stick with a simple formula. However, our ears are open. If this pricing model doesn&rsquo;t work for the type community, then let&rsquo;s start that discussion.</div>

<p>I was just asking, and surely not inferring that a comma is easier to create that an a.*
I was wondering if the price could be subject to market demand (either by charging more the most requested glyphs, or the more specialised ones).
For what is worth, I think the simpler the price plan is, the better.</p>
<ul>
<li>But probably it is more easily substituted with one from a different font (like the generic sorts of metal past).</li>

Well, for some indy foundries, the "freemium" model has worked.
So, maybe a foundry could offer a limited number of glyphs for free (indefinitely, or for a limited time, or upon a newsletter subscription...).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Being an old fart and remembering what it used to cost to get a few lines of text set for one-time use, I have a tough time seeing how $25 dollars could be a barrier to anyone for the purchase of a font.  I made a little experiment.  I started off the sale of a display font with 640 glyph character set at what to me was a very under-priced $20 ( I felt that $35 was the fair price I should have set to begin with).  Later, I put it on sale at half price [as in 50% off or only 10 bucks].  The funny thing is, I sold more fonts [units]  in less time at $20 dollars that I did at half price by a two to one margin! Here is an example:
20 units @ $20 sold in TEN days equals $400
10 units @ $10 sold in THIRTY days equals $100 [this also came with added advertising on MyFonts on Sale list].</p>
<p>Clearly, the scrapbookers are not interested enough in my $10 dollar font to get anywhere near close to matching either sales or profits from the real professional type users who were happy to pay only $20 and perhaps were wondering to themselves, &ldquo;There must be something wrong with this font if it only costs $20.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two ways to look at this.  I could drop the price to a ridiculous five dollars to entice the scrapbookers or decide they are not worth the effort.  For me to make five dollar fonts, they would need to be bare-bones minimum character set and not all that carefully done. There are plenty of folks happily making money doing this who are content with themselves and their work doing this.  Hats off to them.  For me, I just don&rsquo;t want to make shit and call it type just to make some money.  I would so hate that!  I might as well work at McDonalds and serve shit food at minimum wage.  I would rather just ignore the hobby market and try to appeal to the people who really care about type.  Maybe I will fail at that and misunderstand what the professional market wants, expects, and is willing to pay, but I can live with that kind of failure.  I could not live with the other kind of failure though, where I make shit type that sells for shit but makes a profit because that market does not give a shit.</p>

<p>There are certainly some similarities in our business models, but there are some <em>major</em> differences. At its core, FontSlice is just another font distributor. At any given time, FontSlice users could own any number of abridged <em>and</em> unabridged fonts, meaning that our platform could completely replace their previous distributor of choice. Our sights are set high: we want to be the MyFonts replacement. (I know, I know — that may take divine intervention — but why dream at all if you can&rsquo;t dream big?) We think we can get there by giving consumers more options.</p>
<p>Every font distributor has their niche — something that sets them apart from other distributors in hopes of encouraging consumers to shop there. Our niche will be incremental ownership; you can think of it as zero-interest financing for fonts. This concept doesn&rsquo;t come into play at Photo-Lettering. When a user purchases an abridged font on FontSlice, they are actually purchasing a font rather than a vector image. If they already own a portion of a font, they will have incentive to use it again for future projects, purchasing new glyphs as they go. Most importantly, users can still purchase entire fonts as they always have. Thus, FontSlice will be one-stop shopping for the font industry. Like I mentioned earlier, FontSlice will be the gateway drug into the font world. When users are ready to try the hard stuff, they&rsquo;ll already know a dealer. (Okay, maybe I should stop with the drug analogies&hellip;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you like the idea! You&rsquo;re absolutely right; buying an abridged font may not be practical for large projects involving a lot of type. That&rsquo;s why FontSlice will also function as a regular distributor, so designers can purchase both abridged <em>and</em> unabridged fonts. We hope to attract people away from other distributors by giving them more purchasing options and an overall better shopping experience.</div>

You make an excellent point. We realized early on that foundries would not be on board with a linear pricing model (i.e. if the price of each glyph was simply the total price divided by the number of glyphs). A linear pricing model would mean that some smaller transactions might only be a few pennies - which certainly doesn't sit well with the artists that put all the effort into designing the font. This is why we use a non-linear pricing model. In other words, a consumer who only purchases a few glyphs will pay significantly more per glyph than a consumer who purchases many glyphs. The per-glyph rate decreases as you buy more, which actually gives the consumer an incentive to come back and purchase the rest of the font.</div>

<p>Thanks Pablo! You&rsquo;re right - other distributors are already starting to offer subsets by packaging them as &lsquo;Basic&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pro&rsquo;. FontSlice essentially takes that idea to the next level. Customers who are typesetting more than just display copy will be able to choose a language from a drop-down menu, which will automatically insert all the characters required for that language.</p>

Likely scenario: I do a piece for a client in English. Ater some time, it turns out it will be translated into another language, so I buy that language specific “extension”.
Obviously the tricky part is that the font must have the characters available to begin with.
But perhaps, in the long run, a similar model would help designers better evaluate the ROI of covering different languages.</div>

<p>Riccardo, I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that scenario before so I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned it! Fonts will be searchable by language, so if someone could at least anticipate which languages they may potentially need in the future, they could limit their search to fonts which have those particular languages available (even if they aren&rsquo;t planning on purchasing those languages at first).</div>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think, FontSlice can come up with a universal system that creates fonts where kerning, OT features and all that stuff will be subsetted properly according to such languages for every given font. 
The niche would be to sell individual characters (e.g. for logotypes), not working fonts in the usual sense.</p>

<p>Hey Ralph! You&rsquo;re right - FontSlice will definitely be useful for logotypes etc., but it will also produce fully functioning fonts. Our algorithm only removes spline data for unlicensed glyphs, which doesn&rsquo;t affect kerning or OpenType features. This means that FontSlice is capable of solving some of the language problems mentioned above.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To my mind, the “discount-for-fewer-languages-supported” might make sense if the font contains, say, Greek and Cyrillic characters but, otherwise, it doesn&rsquo;t. Most of the time and effort put into creating a font are for design and rendering of characters, and kerning. Expanding the basic &ldquo;English&rdquo; characters set to include Latin 1252, Central European 1250, Turkish 1254 and Baltic 1257 is generally just a matter of automated, algorithmic character generation, with a bit of tweaking.</p>
<p>So, the idea may sound good on paper, but such an arrangement represents selling your overall efforts short.</p>
<p>IMHO.</p>

Any cheaper and I don&rsquo;t think it would be worth my while selling this way - I guess very few of my customers use many of the extended character set glyphs; many of them don&rsquo;t even use contextual alternates, ligatures etc. If my fonts were available in abridged versions at discounted prices, this would cut my earnings not increase them (I think! - obviously I have absolutely no evidence for this. I&rsquo;ll check back here and see how it seems to be going for foundries that do sign up with FontSlice, but for me, at this moment in time, I&rsquo;m not prepared to take the plunge)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To expand off of what Nick said, when the character set is expanded, at least in regards to most Latin-based languages, it&rsquo;s not too difficult of a task. The issue arises when the Typeface (for example, my Garvis typeface), includes much more than just European Latin Orthographies. A lot of those glyphs take a lot more time to create.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t really seem fair to charge more because the orthography is more time-intensive to draw (if the user wanted to buy the language support for Hausa or Dinka instead of Portuguese – support for those scripts is scarce enough already), as there would only be a few scripts that fall outside of the &ldquo;auto-generate and tweak&rdquo; language systems. It seems like this would punishing those users for being unlucky enough to need to write in that language. Then they would likely go back to using the same fonts they have always used and type designers will continue not covering those orthographies as nobody would buy them.</p>
<p>What I think will end up happening is this idea will continue to be re-examined until it ends up being the same &ldquo;basic&rdquo; and &ldquo;pro&rdquo; versions – essentially the same as every other distributor.</p>

There’s no need to pay more for Hausa than Portuguese, since you will pay per glyph anyway.

Not if you’re interested only in, let’s say, African languages but not South American ones.

I&rsquo;m actually happy with the OT versions, having saved a few bucks, and not finding the extra languages necessary.

<p>How true: a clever soul could pick and choose ligatures from a font like Ed Interlock and pay no more than half price for the letters selected!</p>
<p>Assuming, of course, this clever soul saw no correlation between time and money…</p>

<p>Thanks Jasper! As you know, many of the best minds in the type world are members of the Typophile community, so we knew that we would be facing our toughest critics. That&rsquo;s why we chose to announce FontSlice here first, figuring that whatever didn&rsquo;t kill us would make us stronger. Most importantly, this process has made us more aware of what is important to the type community. We want FontSlice to be fully vetted <em>before</em> we launch.</div>

<p>Hey Jackson. All the foundries that have contacted us directly have already been given access to the closed beta. If you&rsquo;re potentially interested in a distribution agreement and would like access to the beta, you can email us at <a href="mailto:foundries@fontslice.com">foundries@fontslice.com</a>.</div>
