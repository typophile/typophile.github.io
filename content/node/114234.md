  same letter. I've attached an image of it.. . Anybody?\r\n"

  body: "According to my [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]] there are at least 1,208 serif families with an R of this general
    style. You can narrow that down by a great deal if you know of any other letters
    from this font. Or.. you can try looking through the samples from all 1,208 families
    to see which R resembles the specific shape of this R. \r\n\r\nCan you tell us
    anything about this font, or your sample? Is this a hypothetical R that you drew,
    or a real sample from something?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It would help if you gave some information on the source and date of your
    image. At least you should provide any information you have as to whether it is
    digital or before the current digital era, i.e. circa 1990.\r\nIn any event, the
    R is some version of French Old Style. Can't say anything about the rest of the
    font from which the R was taken, or even if it forms part of a font and is not
    an individual design for an R. \r\nHere is French Old Style No. 2 as sold by ATF
    in 1900 -- and probably similar to versions sold by foundries in Europe and America
    for many years before then[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FrenchOSNo2pATF1900_5314_4068.jpg]\r\nFrench
    Old Style is the English name for a style of font designed by Th\xE9ophile Beaudoire
    in 1858. The upper case is derived from Louis Perrin's Lyon Capitals. The European
    name, sometimes also used in English, is Elzevir. \r\nThis type of leg with some
    rounding of the curve was found in fonts variously called Romana and Devinne.\r\nThe
    leg in a straighter version was fount in ATF fonts circa 1900 particularly some
    by Goudy.\r\nSome digging may produce an exact match to your image, but without
    more information from you I have some doubts as to the prospects for quick  success.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "this is indeed a version I redrew, its from a iron typeface that has been
    put on a facade about 20 years ago. The letters are in a classical style, probably
    a french one like you guys suggest. The A is also a bid odd, it has a very low
    horizontal bar...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6324.jpg]"

    would be a suitable model for the rest of your project.\r\nDon"
