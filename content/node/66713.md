    first thing to do is check your vertical metrics and upm. In my case I ended up
    having to rebuild the file and reinstall fontlab. "

  body: "It looks like you can fix this by going to Preferences, Glyph Window, Dimensions,
    and adjust <cite>Visual ascender and descender</cite>. If you give it something
    like 100% & \u201330% that should look okay in the Font Window and preview."

  body: Definitely something to do with with the vertical metrics. It also looks like
    this when you have 2000UPM characters on a 1000UPM grid.

  body: "Great, thanks for your responses. Tim your suggestion\r\nworked a treat \u2013
    do you know what the default setting is?\r\n\r\nIncidentally I just upped the
    UPM to 2000 on a font I am\r\ndrawing, why don't I always work like this? It's
    so much\r\neasier to get the shapes I want. I think I may start fonts\r\nat 1000
    and move to 2000 for the trickier characters.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody else work like
    this?"

  body: You can work at 2000 UPM, unless the fonts are to be generated as Type 1 (those
    need to be 1000 UPM). If you scale the UPM, you can also tick the 'scale all glyphs...'
    as well if you want to physically scale the characters themselves to fit the size.
    Although you have to remember that scaling up and down between UPM sizes <em>with
    'scale all glyphs...' turned on</em> can introduce rounding-off issues into your
    characters. I.e. some anchor-points might slightly move, especially when scaling
    a 2000 UPM character down to 1000, because the grid on which the points need to
    align is more coarse. The changes are tiny, but if you're working very precise
    you might want to keep it in mind.

  body: "> do you know what the default setting is?\r\n\r\nNot sure, you'd have to
    re-install FontLab to find out. In the user manual (p 77 in the Mac version) it
    says 100% & \u201340%, which is a good default value, I think.\r\n\r\nYou can
    lower the upper value to just above your ascender height, and probably raise the
    lower one as well. It depends on whether you prefer the glyph as large as possible
    or rather make sure nothing is ever cropped. It's a personal preference, that's
    why it's in the options. It also has an effect on the Preview/Metrics window,
    that's when I typically decide to change it."
