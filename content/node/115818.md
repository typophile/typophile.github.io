  body: "The sign might not be an exact match to a font.\r\nIf you want a substitute,
    I suggest Hess Old Style RR Bold, which is based on a design by Sol Hess for Lanston
    Monotype in the early 1920s http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/hess-old-style-rr/
    It could used as is or edited to make a match. The main things would be to compress
    the C, n and o, trim the spur from the S bottom terminal and perhaps clip a small
    slice off the tip of the terminal on r.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
