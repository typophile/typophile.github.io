  body: "I'd say \"STRATOCASTER\" is Futura, not Century Gothic. \"MADE IN MEXICO\"
    is too small for me to tell if it's Helvetica, Arial, or otherwise. Same with
    \"SERIAL NUMBER\".\r\n\r\n\"MZ6\" looks like Times New Roman.\r\n\r\n\"162748\"
    is very similar to PSY/OPS' Crash Numbering.\r\n\r\n\"Fender\" is obviously custom-drawn.\r\n\r\n
