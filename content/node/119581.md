  sans serif in this logo is helvetica. I don't know what script typeface is in the
  logo.\r\nCan anyone help? I'm creating a speculative redesign of a mobile website
  for a community college\r\nclass and for my portfolio. Thanks very much.\r\n\r\nRich"

    has a some variance in the stroke width and an O with parallel sides, so it's
    not Helvetica. It'll take me a minute to offer up some suggestions."
