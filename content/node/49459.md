  have just spent around 300 hours and 8 weeks working on my first type family. It\u2019s
  been absolutely pain staking work, but now it\u2019s complete I think it\u2019s
  worth it. Have and look and let me know if you like it, It\u2019s been accepted
  by T26, but again I am a beginner learning a new craft, so please go easy on me
  :D\r\n\r\nHad some problems uploading it, so I will have to link to it unfortunately,\r\n\r\nhttp://www.behance.net/Gallery/Hirukoa-Type-Family/125049\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex."
