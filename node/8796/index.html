		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m not a fan of D, but you&#39;ve got to experiement with these things haven&#39;t you? <BR> <BR>A&#39;s nice, but perhaps a bit too nice. It&#39;d be useful to know what kind of non-fiction this publication is looking to publish. I guess they&#39;ll say &#39;anything and everything&#39; but they must have a direction in mind -- is the direction scientific? religious? serious and formal? loose and humorous? <BR> <BR>I actually really like B: it looks like the title of a 70s naturist photography book. Not that I own any 70s naturist photography books, but you &#40;hopefully don&#39;t&#41; know what I mean. <BR> <BR>Seriously, it looks like with a bit of work it could, well, work. A little spacing &#40;between w and o, and r and d&#41; and a slight resizing and loosening of the 400, and I think it could work. I won&#39;t promise anything though <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>C is the most coherant concept, though I actually prefer your handwritten &#40;I presume&#41; in your first post. If you tidied the sript up a little on that one &#40;the R&#39;s and the tail on the f promarily&#41; I think it could be a really nice idea.  <BR> <BR>The regularity of the script in C is a little mundane compared to the example in your opening post. I&#39;ll add my name to the list of admirers of that engraved face though -- it&#39;s lovely. <BR> <BR>jordan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A: I&#39;m not a fan of this. I&#39;ve never like swash caps in one word without any sort of custom ligatures to unify them. It always struck me as a bunch of beauty contestants in a row, rather than an integrated team. <BR> <BR>B: I really like the type, but the visual cues draw cultural and historical associations that don&#39;t feel relevant or wanted for your purpose. <BR> <BR>C: I think this is the most appropriate, though I prefer the less formal feel of the original script. I think this one is worth further efforts and variations. I like the contrast of the informal against the formal, but with all hand-written forms &#40;Ermine doesn&#39;t strike me as an engraved face, or am I wrong?&#41;. <BR> <BR>D: This one doesn&#39;t feel bad to me, but it doesn&#39;t feel right to me either. It strikes me more as a title that&#39;s logo-ish, rather than a logo that speaks to writing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I join the chorus singing for the first concept:  the &#39;WORDS&#39; looks great. And I like the nearly matching stroke-thickness between the thin parts of the WORD-letters and the stroke-thickness in your handwriting. That&#39;s why I&#39;d vote for version nr. 1. <BR> <BR>But the main reason why I prefer the first example is that I think that the different sizes of the two words provide more energy than the two similar sized words in the examples presented in your pdf. So I would start by reworking the &#39;Fourhundred&#39; a bit. <BR> <BR>Another idea concerning the Fourhundred/400: have you already tried to draw something like that swinging f-bow with the 4? That could be nice because of their formal similarity.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I liked your original concept of combining a hand-drawn font with a more formal set font. And I believe you can continue that concept as you experiment with a more urban feel. Perhaps a grafiti style of hand-drawn lettering or a broken typewriter look might give the client the edgier/urban look she wants. Then again these could be obvious/trite suggestions. Surban girl from Connecticut might not be the best source for edgy/urban ideas. Keep posting I&#39;ve enjoyed seeing your process.</div>
