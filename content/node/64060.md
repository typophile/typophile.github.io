body: "Fans of the classic Doctor Who program will recognize the attached photograph
  as William Hartnell, the first Doctor from 1963, entering his time machine, a.k.a.
  the TARDIS.\r\n\r\nAssuming that plaque on the door wasn't simply a hand-lettered
  sign, I'm hoping to identify the font used on the original prop. The plaque changed
  many times over the years, but it always said (basically) the same thing:\r\n\r\nPOLICE
  TELEPHONE\r\n\r\nFREE\r\nFOR USE OF\r\nPUBLIC\r\n\r\nADVICE AND ASSISTANCE\r\nOBTAINABLE
  IMMEDIATELY\r\n\r\nOFFICERS AND CARS\r\nRESPOND TO\r\nURGENT CALLS\r\n\r\nPULL TO
  OPEN\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nThe sample photo is small, but the 'U' in 'PUBLIC' is distinctive.
  Also, it appears the center vertex of the 'M' floats above the baseline while the
  verticals of the 'M' are parallel. Closest I've come so far is a face called 'Apolline,'
  but it's not quite there.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated!"

    back and find the post deleted.\r\n\r\nI was very into Doctor Who back in the
    eighties and have a few books about the show, one of which has a large reproduction
    of your sample photo and one other that is similar. Both are a bit fuzzy, but
    I think it's quite likely that it was hand drawn for the prop. Nevertheless, I
    think <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/weiss/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D66%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DFREE%2520FOR%2520USE%2520OF%2520PUBLIC%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D19\">Weiss</a>
    is going to be very close, and may be what it was based on, if it was drawn by
    hand."

  body: "Thanks, Mark! I messed up the initial post and had to do it over again (newbie).
    And Weiss is a great suggestion.\r\n\r\nI probably have one of those same Doctor
    Who books at home. Will have to check it out over the holidays. Again, your advice
    is much appreciated."

    Peter Haining (1983), p. 129, and a different one appears in "Doctor Who--The
