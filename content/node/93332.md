body: "I'm trying to get a handle on new characters that have emerged in recent years,
  which are important enough to show up in standard Latin fonts (western + CE accented).
  Also secondarily curious about anything relevant to Greek and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nThe
  ones I know about are currency symbols, such as the new symbols for the Turkish
  lira (U+20BA, http://typophile.com/node/90604), and the Indian rupee (U+20B9). Older
  ones include the Ukrainian hryvna (U+20B4) and Ghanaian cedi. Are there others I
  should be concerned with?"

  body: Andreas, I think Tom is specifically asking for what might be called 'emerging
    characters', i.e. not just characters that have been added to Unicode but which
    are either recently invented or only now coming into more widespread use.

  body: "The Sarcmark!\r\n<blockquote>... important enough to show up in standard
    Latin fonts ...</blockquote>\r\nOh wait ...\r\n\r\nI don't think that there have
    been major additions in Latin/CE fonts lately. The last really major one, influencing
    <em>every</em> font, was indeed the Euro sign. Anything else has been quite font
    specific -- i.e., up to the designer's whims.\r\n\r\nIf your own font set goes
    back more than a decade or so, you could put a modern one and an old one side
    by side and compare them. A modern version of an old font might typically contain
    more ligatures, small caps, and different digit styles; perhaps some (or lots)
    of extra accented characters (because Opentype allows more code points to be defined
    in the font than, say, Type 1 fonts, it makes sense to include lots of them rather
    than relying on non-spacing accents and having the user combine them themselves).\r\nHowever,
    I can predict with some confidence the \"basic\" characters section will be unchanged."
