  about the 90.\r\n\r\nAnybody care to lend a helping hand?\r\n\r\nThanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thoni902_4341.jpg]"

  body: Thoni Oil Co. appears to be in an old ATF face called Poster Gothic; unfortunately,
    the font available by that name doesn't resemble the original in any way, shape
    or form. FWIW, I have a version in the works, but it's a few months off...

  body: "Mr. Curtis,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your response. I would be very
    much interested in your version. Could you please keep me in the loop when it
    becomes available? I found this while researching my last name. I've always wanted
    to make it into t-shirts for cousins.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "Mark, don't know about the original typeface, but Mr. Curtis usually knows
    his stuff. If you want a similar digital substitute now, try \r\n<a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?GZX\">Morris
    Sans Condensed</a>. Basically Bank Gothic with more variations and lowercases.
    The small cursive font looks like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/italic/\">Lydian
    Italic</a> to me. Have no time now to look for substitutes for the 90, maybe later. "

  body: "This sort of thing was always hand-lettered, not set in type, or based on
    specific typefaces. By hand-lettered, I don't mean each globe was painted by hand.
    It would have been silkscreened (or something similar), but based on hand-drawn
    original art. \r\n\r\nRefrigerator was inspired by things like this. I did it
    precisely because no existing typefaces looked quite like hand-drawn styles like
    this.\r\n\r\nThe small line does look like Lydian and is small enough that it
    probably was set from type on the original art."

  body: "Renko, I have purchased Mr. Curtis' fonts before and will continue to do
    so. Especially when his version of Poster Gothic is available. Thank you very
    much for your response.\r\n\r\nMr. Simonson, Thank you very much for your reply
    as well. Judging by the responses, my type id-ing skills aren't so bad.\r\n\r\nI
    sincerely appreciate all the hard work you all do. Your time is even more appreciated.
    The fact that you took the time to respond is very humbling.\r\n\r\nI wish you
    all the best and will continue to admire your work from afar.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nMark
