    is a master at designing idiosyncratic typefaces, and his interpretation of the

  body: Good to see you can back your point up today Yves! ;) I should have put a
    smiley after what was meant to be a lighthearted enough comment. Farao looks like
    a well designed face for what it is. I know I'd never use it in my own work, just
    not my cup of tea.

  body: Exactly. As I commented in that other thread, if everybody loved the same
    typeface 99% of the type designers would be out of a job. ;^)
