  Blake and some of the characters baffle me.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ParisianRonde-medium_3886.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
  was the purpose of the small slash with comma and small slash with period characters?
  And what about /o'c? I gather these had something to do with invitations and/or
  calling cards (looking at the /r. and /rs. sorts), but their use eludes me.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!"

  body: This is just a guess - but the /, and /. look to me like the slashes were
    meant to be the trailing stroke of the preceding letter. The r. and rs. are simply
    ligatures, since there would be no other way to have the period under the r's
    overhang, or to connect an 'r' with a 'standard' 's'.  The o'c is probably a similar
    ligature commonly used as in five o'clock.
