body: 'I''ve actually been trying to conceptualize, for several years, a typeface
  to convey a particular idea (that I don''t want to give away just yet) and it recently
  occurred to me that in order to achieve the desired connotation I''m shooting for,
  it would be desirable to do create a typeface combining several different aspects,
  one of which was the paradigm of the brush + a serif font. Once I realized this,
  I immediately thought of Underware''s work and Dolly in particular. To be honest,
  I can''t really think of another brushy serif that isn''t compared to Dolly (Dederon
  often being cited as a clone). Of course I want to avoid aping someone else''s work,
  but it almost seems that when it comes to designing a brush-informed serif typeface
  it is inevitable that it will be compared to the exemplar of the genre: Dolly. It
  doesn''t seem possible that in the hundreds of years of type that Dolly was the
  first example of a brushy serif, but I can''t think of one that pre-dates it or
  many other types that would fit into this category. Before I go any further, I''m
  curious if anyone out there is aware of other serif typefaces that that incorporate
  the brush-formed structure and still avoid the problem of looking too much like
  Dolly. Also, is it possible to create a brush serif that avoids Dolly comparisons?
  Will Dolly, in time, be seen as the father of the genre, much as Johnston''s Underground
  has spawned so many humanist sans typefaces? If you''re so inclined, please enlighten
  me! '

  body: hmmm, to me 'brushy' typically involves a bit of plumpness and roundness.
    maybe the combination of the 3 elements is what makes Dolly? brush + rounded +
    serif?

  body: hmmm, some of these bring up another aspect that makes Dolly itself, the element
    of 'structure', especially in the Roman. Some of these other brushy faces, like
    Rumba, distance themselves from Dolly by incorporating a more eccentric character.
    That's probably why I didn't think of them to begin with. Also some of this other
    'Dutch school' stuff is good to be reminded of. Actually, I should have investigated
    this area first, because my ideas started coming together when someone referred
    to Grandia as being 'Reading house style' and I was thinking of what would characterize
    the 'KABK house style' and thought that it would be this brushy stuff. Then I
    thought what would happen if I reconciled the two houses and incorporated elements
    of both in a typeface. Looking at the Kompilat thread actually scares me a bit.
    I know I looked at it before I started Reading, but I never referred to it when
    I was Designing Grandia, it must have become engrained in my unconciousness. Yet
    it's interesting that Ondrej and I made quite a lot of the same design decisions,
    espeically in the Roman. Thank goodness the italics are more divergent! His roman
    has a few brush elements (as Does Grandia), but is more calligraphic in general
    than brush-informed. Interesting, gives me a lot to think on. Thanks for your
    help, folks. Of course more comments are welcome, if you desire to make any...

  body: "I regard Peter Verheul\u2019s work as the main inspiration for a lot of brushy
    typefaces from The Hague. This can be seen in his typeface [[http://www.farhill.nl/01_typefaces/versa.html|Versa]]
    which is used throughout the book Dutch Type. An even better example is the precursor
    to Versa, called Nardy, which he designed in the mid-nineties. Peter Verheul might
    be relatively unknown to most but he makes innovative and sometimes highly experimental
    designs and has a good hand for teaching.\r\n\r\nThe origins of this brush style
    can be attributed to the calligraphic exercises with the flat brush that he teaches
    at the MA Type & Media. I teach this technique to a group of undergraduate students
    at the KABK as well. The flexible brush is more difficult to control than the
    stiff broad-nibbed pen but it also invites playfulness and experimentation.\r\n\r\nOn
    a different note: I wouldn\u2019t classify Lexicon (1992) as particularly brushy
    though (Trinit\xE9 (1979) would suit that title better) but both of Bram de Does\u2019
    typefaces have inspired numerous (ex-)KABK students indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Paul van
    der Laan\r\nwww.type-invaders.com\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW: Paul, calling Ondrej \u201Cfrom
    the house of KABK\u201D doesn\u2019t do him justice, does it? He only started
    at the MA Type & Media two months ago. All his work shown here on Typophile was
    made whilst he was still an undergraduate in Bratislava."

    Okay i'll take my previous comment back. Of course i find it silly to make stereotypical
    remarks myself, so all this talk of 'Reading style' and 'KABK style' is a bit
    tounge-in-cheek. I will have to buy some brushes and do some experiments of my
    own with them. Are there other implements that you experiment with in the courses
    you teach? I'm ready to start getting my hands dirty in this respect.
