body: I have two type-related domain names that expire on November 2nd. I&#39;ve decided
  not to renew them this time around and I&#39;m wondering if anyone may be interested
  in taking them over. I&#39;m not looking at selling them, just finding them new
  homes. There&#39;s currently next to no traffic hitting the domains, as they have
  been simply sitting as placeholders for a past several years. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typopolis.com/">typopolis.com</a>
  <BR><a href="http://www.fontopolis.com/">fontopolis.com</a> <BR> <BR>They are registered
  at <a href="http://www.dotster.com/">Dotster</a> and I can easily transfer them
  directly into another Dotster account. The new account holder can then renew them
  as they see fit. <BR> <BR>Send me a message if you&#39;re interested. <BR> <BR>Grant

  body: Grant, I love the word &#34;bullshitless&#34; &#40;from your blog, following
    the link from typopolis.com&#41;. That&#39;s what I was trying to say about Tim
    Cole in the AIGA thread. Now I&#39;ll have to steal that word. Thanks.
