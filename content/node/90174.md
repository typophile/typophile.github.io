  requirement in the state of Washington, we all have to complete a final culminating
  project of our choice.\r\n\r\nI have chosen to design a typeface for my senior project.\r\nk\r\nAs
  part of this requirement, I need a mentor, someone to show and teach me how to build
  a typeface.\r\nIf you'd like to volunteer your time to help me with this project
  it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nHere's my contact info:\r\nBjornharlson1@msn.com\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/bjorn.harlson\r\n\r\n"

    spitting contest. I wouldn't trade my work for yours\r\n(or even James's) and
    I'm sure you feel the same. And I would\r\nconfidently challenge you when it comes
    to cultural longevity,\r\nas opposed to number-of-fonts-sold.\r\n\r\nBut let's
    focus on the topic. Type design is indeed complex.\r\nI think it's even more complex
    than you think. Does that mean\r\na physical mentor is ideal? It sure saves you
    time. But such\r\nan education also has a dark side: it tends to make a person\r\ninto
    a diluted imitation of the master. The amount of time it\r\ncould take to overcome
    this limiting influence could instead\r\nbe spent finding one's own path from
    scratch, stumbling much\r\nmore often and taking much longer to get anywhere useful,
    but\r\nresulting in something Real. It's quite telling that most type\r\ndesigners
    are self-taught. Aren't you? And in your 5+ years\r\nof frequenting this place,
    what have you gotten out of it? Self-\r\ntaught in no way precludes asking for
    people's help and opinions.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/90036\r\n\r\nPay
    attention to Bj\xF8rn's situation. He's graduating high-school.\r\nDoes anybody
    expect him to produce a salable font? This can't be\r\nanything more than an -enviable-
    opportunity to merely start to\r\nunravel a fascinating craft. And Typophile would
    expose Bj\xF8rn to\r\nmuch more than one person ever could.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    mud-slinging (and don't see why mud-slinging would be appropriate especially since
    we're discussing something as constructive as feedback and learning), but it's
    a fact that my Ernestine wouldn't have become what it has not just without Hrant's

    feedback process on Typophile</a> that preceded that. I have stated that I personally
    have likely learned more on Typophile than in the little postgraduate class I
    took. James and James, you can choose to deny that, but that doesn't make it untrue."

    agree it can be a great forum for learning exactly what you need to, and I'd encourage
    Bj\xF8rn to seek critique here anyway, but if you're under pressure of deadlines
    it would be better to also have another source for learning, I think."

    most of the input is coming from fellow relative newbies. They are the ones with
    most interest in participating. So it is kind of like a teacherless classroom,
    but full of motivated students. The blind leading the blind, but at least we're
    getting somewhere!\r\n\r\nOne other point: I certainly have learned from putting
    my designs up for critique on Typophile (every one of the few substantial projects
    I've done so far), but I think I learned even more from participating in the threads
    on others' designs (Nina, Ben, Sindre esp.). So in addition to encouraging Bj\xF8rn
    to consider posting his stuff there, I'd tell him to go follow others' threads
    there, make observations and ask questions. \r\n\r\nJames (Dunwich), you gave
    me the very first substantial [[http://typophile.com/node/50618#comment-307869|feedback]]
    on my very first posted project four years ago. The content of your comments was
    useful, but even more, that encouraged me to keep going and kicked off the exchange
    with Typophile critics from which I learned so much. I'm grateful!"

    a typeface\u201D as part of a graphic design degree course at several colleges/universities,
    and in each case a term/semester of around 14 weeks, 6 hours a week with homework
    assignments, has been allocated to the task.\r\nNow, one-on-one software training,
    direction and feedback from a pro might speed things up a bit, but still\u2026\r\nBj\xF8rn,
    how much time have you set aside\u2014do you have 100 hrs?\r\n\r\nThe problem
    is that all these ostensibly technical aspects of type design and production take
    time to understand and implement:\r\n- BCP fundamentals\r\n- Sidebearings\r\n-
    Overshoot\r\n- Stem width variation: horizontal and vertical, straight and curved,
    upper and lower case\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would recommend working with a simplified
    application such as Font Constructor.\r\nTaking that route, the role of mentor
    would be more brief critique than lengthy instruction.\r\nSure, online feedback
    can play a role, but the stipulation is to have face-time with a mentor."

    people living in the 1990s, and confusing conversations that result from a lot
    of people using ill-defined technical language. Some posters write in riddes,
    and a few are just plain crazy. There is no list of people worth listening. I
    really would have been a lot better off finding a mentor to work with and ignoring
    a lot of what I read on Typophile.\r\n\r\nBjorn, you are lucky to be in a city
    where you have access to some great mentors. Hopefully Simon will get you in touch
    with some people who can guide you one-on-one. Take advantage of that resource.\r\n\r\n<cite>This

  body: Listening to comments in the Critique area does not mean abiding by every
    one or even any, if that is how it turns out.  What you get is a smorgasbord of
    variation on your theme.  Many comments oppose each other.  That is a good thing!  It
    helps you see that there is not any "one true way" and that you have to be willing
    to make your own contribution based on what you have learned--not how happy you
    have made all the posters by taking their advice literally. Designing type is
    a long, mostly solitary, journey.  If you are the kind of person who can not only
    persevere but look forward to the endeavor, charge ahead.  Keep an open mind and
    be willing to work countless hours just because you want to.

    taken the time to slowly wade\r\nthrough the good and the bad and decided for
