  ever existed, even before digital type? \r\nAs far as I've searched (very briefly
  I must say) the new opentype versions of the font do not include Greek letters apart
  from some symbols. I'd like to know if anything like that is in plan. I think I
  crossed an extended version once, years ago, but I did't know where they came from.
  They may exist with a different name...\r\n\r\nthanks"

    Aparently Berthold doesn't do much of anything anymore other than sell existing
    stuff. Have you talked to Klimis about it? He would probably know for sure.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
