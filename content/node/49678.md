body: For a newspaper, we are looking for a good condensed headline serif font. We
  have been using Garamond Condensed, but we are looking for other choices, ideas?

    x-height, that differs from the good Garamonds i know \u2026\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Swift+condensed&x=27&y=8\r\n"

  body: "&lt;self-promotion&gt;\r\n\r\nThe [[http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmDisOverview.html|Whitman
    Display]] fonts were developed originally for newspaper headlines. (Minneapolis
    Star Tribune commissioned the initial styles.) The x-ht/extender proportions are
    a little more classical than some other recent news headletter styles and might
    be an easier transition from Garamond (if that's important).\r\n\r\nThe fonts
    haven't yet been put up for Retail download on Font Bureau's website, but they
    are available for license by contacting FB directly. \r\n\r\nYou can see samples
    at my site: http://www.kentlew.com. \r\n\r\nAlso, there's a PDF showing available
    (not linked on the site) here: http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay_Sample.pdf\r\n\r\n&lt;/self-promotion&gt;\r\n\r\n--
