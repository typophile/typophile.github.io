  application (by Filemaker) in your business, they've just announced that it'll be
  discontinued. \r\n\r\nBento was far from perfect, but was great for someone who
  just needed a simple database. I've kept my business records on it for 5 years.
  \r\n\r\nFilemaker is offering a discount until Oct. 30 for registered Bento users
  who want to upgrade to Filemaker Pro.\r\nhttp://info.filemaker.com/FMP_overview.html\r\n\r\n"
