    effects (inline/outline, dimension) added possibly by his wife Louise Fili? It
    has her touch."

  body: They (Heller and Fili) are listed as co-authors of this one... The cover certainly
    has her touch, which may mean that the title letters were drawn especially for
    this project.

  body: I'm no closer to identifying the face used here, but I just saw the book at
    a store, and the cover and interiors were designed by <a href="http://www.tdc.org/about/roberts.html"
    target="_blank">Chad Roberts</a> of <a href="http://www.louisefili.com/flash.html"
    target="_blank">Louise Fili Ltd</a>. You were spot on, Patty!
