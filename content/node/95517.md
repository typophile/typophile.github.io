  is the title of Ramiro Espinoza\u2019s in-depth look at Spanish Baroque calligraphy\u2019s
  most extreme tendencies, and especially at some of those produced by the writing
  masters Pedro D\xEDaz Morante and Juan Claudio Aznar de Polanco. These 17th and
  18th centuries alphabets with their plentiful calligraphic flourishes represented
  a marked break with the harmonic and angular Renaissance Cancellaresca style.\r\nIt
  was Morante who first introduced and popularized the use of the pointed quill in
  Spain, and although his famous text entitled <em>\u201CArte Nueva de escribir\u201D</em>
  \u2013 first volume published in 1616 \u2013 contains alphabets that have much in
  common with traditional broad nib Cancellaresca calligraphy, most of the examples
  therein are outgrowths of the new models put forward by the Italian master Gianfrancesco
  Cresci.\r\nThe writing\u2019s swashes are complex and intricate, but at the same
  time they feature a profusion of defects. Many of them sometimes come close to ugliness.
  However, these pages contain an artistic essence that bears a relationship to the
  ironic and sometimes somber character of Spanish Baroque.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/morante_4712.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/credits-morante_6068.gif]\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
  why the name of the font pays homage to <em>\u201CDulcinea del Toboso\u201D</em>,
  the fictional beauty from Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote, a work that reveals
  many of the period\u2019s conflicts, such as the contrast between utopian ideals
  and reality, uncertainty and madness.\r\nBut Dulcinea is far from being just a revival.
  Its forms are not careful tracings of the outlines of Morante and Polanco\u2019s
  letters, nor are they attempts to reproduce them digitally. In fact, the author
  of the letters says that had the font been created that way it would have been too
  archaic to serve as acceptable contemporary typography. However, he believes that
  there are myriad interesting details that can be rescued and preserved, along with
  the playful spirit of the original.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/polanco_4739.vs.dulcinea.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/caption-polanco_6190.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  work of designing Dulcinea consisted of combining original historical elements with
  the creativity and calligraphy of the font\u2019s author in order to produce a modern
  typography that isn\u2019t based on the same traditional sources as many recently
  created scripts fonts.\r\nDulcinea offers attractive options for the setting of
  texts and headlines: abundant ligatures and swashes along with intricate alternate
  characters. It sophisticated forms make it an ideal option for women\u2019s magazines,
  recipe books, lingerie products or perfume packaging.\r\n\r\nDulcinea can be purchased

  body: "Hi Ramiro, Awesome font! Great work as usual.\r\n\r\nJust a little historic
    observation. When you say: \r\n\"It was Morante who first introduced and popularized
    the use of the pointed quill in Spain, and although his famous text entitled \u201CArte
    Nueva de escribir\u201D \u2013 first volume published in 1616 \u2013 \"\r\n\r\nYou
    may be overlooking the awesome work of Juan de Yciar (aka Joanes de Iciar), from
    Saragoza. He published \"Arte Subtilissima por la cual se ense\xF1a a escribir
    perfectamente\" in 1548 (8 editions from 1548 to 1566). It's a writing manual,
    similar to those of Arrighi, Tagliente and Palatino (In fact, Juan de Yciar analyze
    in depth all those three masters, quoting similarities and differences within
    each method, and stating his own preferences).\r\n\r\nA limited edition (200 copies)
    facsimile of the 1550 edition was produced, reprinted from the original books
    in possession of Philip Hofer and Stanley Morrison. (I own one, and there are
    still a few available on Amazon). I also believe that JvK have studied this book,
    as I see some traits of Juan de Yciar \"Letra Antigua spesVnica\" and \"Alphabetvm
    Latinorvm\" in the first unrevised Lutetia (like the full-square proportions of
    the /E /F /L, the high crossbar of the /G, the high and to-the-right dot on the
    /i, the wide /o and narrow /n, maybe the structure of the /g). But of course,
    this can be just my erroneous impression, or simply a coincidence.. don't take
    my word very seriously.\r\n\r\nIf you read Spanish, you will also enjoy reading
    Castellano Antiguo.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Pablo,\r\nThanks for the compliments. I know Yciar's work. In fact I have
    a facsimile of his book. But his work clearly follows the principles of Humanistic
    chancery and belong to the Renaissance. There are no traces of *pointed pen* in
    these pages but broad nib. What I said is Morante popularized Cresci's pointed
    pen style, a departure from the traditional chancery. I focused on Spanish Baroque
    calligraphy only."
