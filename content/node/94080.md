body: "I\u2019m in the process of conglomerating all of my pi character and border
  fonts into a popularly-priced package, and I want to explore a particular avenue
  of expanding the border fonts\u2019 ease of use by creating Illustrator brushes.\r\n\r\nGenerally,
  when you create a border in font mode, there's one character for the upper left-hand
  corner, one or more top elements, an upper right-hand corner element, one or more
  left and right side elements, then vertical mirrors of the corner and span elements.
  All of the fonts are built on a solid em\u2014in an OTF font, a 1,000\xD71,000 box
  with a 1,000 unit spacebar\u2014so creating a border involves reading a key, then
  typing in the appropriate characters and number of spaces. One the other hand, a
  single corner element and a single span element in an Illustrator brush will rotate
  into the proper positions as a rectangle is drawn.\r\n\r\nI understand that I need
  to create swatches from the various elements, and then use those swatches to build
  the brushes. The problem is, when I convert the individual glyphs into compound
  paths, the bbox info goes out the window, which causes problems like this...\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://www.nicksfonts.com/depot/bbox_blues.png\" />\r\n\r\nThe top elements
  are the font, the bottom elements are the brush.\r\n\r\nI freely admit that, when
  it comes to Illustrator, I am a purposeful dunce. So, I thought I would check online
  to see if there was a tutorial that would guide me through the process of setting
  the bounding box so that the elements fall where they are supposed to fall to make
  the border work. I\u2019m thinking that there has got to be a simple way to accomplish
  this, but I haven\u2019t found it so far\u2026"

  body: "Herb,\r\n\r\nA line with no stroke might work\u2014as long as Illustrator
    didn't exhibit its natural tendency to want to close open contours. But I am reasonably
    confident that a box would present a problem if the end user were to apply a color
    to the brush."

  body: Herb's got it right-- group each tile with an invisible rectangle (no fill
    or stroke) that defines the "bounding box." To clearly see how it works, drag
    one of Illustrator's preset border brushes out onto the canvas and examine the
    pieces. The corner tiles should be perfectly square, the side tiles should have
    the same "em" height but can be a different width.
