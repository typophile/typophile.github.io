  made this logo for an Artificial Intelligence symposium at the Radboud University
  in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. I'm pleased with it, it portrays the \"motion\" aspect
  well I think. Please tell me what you think."

  body: Exagerate the expanding spacing in motion so its obvious, otherwise nice work!

  body: "Try to balance the spacing between the flying squares so those on the top
    (they separate from the static ones quite abruptly) relate to those on the bottom
    (they get too close there, and may cause some visual noise). \r\nI like it a lot,
    it gets the motion feeling just right, not forgetting the \"tech\" aspect of ai.\r\nNice
    work!\r\n"

  body: "Nice idea. A bit too complex for my taste, though. Can you lose elements
    and squares without losing the overall feel?  \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nMy
    work is a game. A very serious game [M.C. Escher]"

  body: While I like the concept, I find that the use of different widths for the
    two grid structures is problematic. I also feel the lower grid is too tight on
    'BNAIS 2005'. Perhaps the lower grid is not necessary?
