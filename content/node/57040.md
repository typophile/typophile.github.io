  body: "I think this might be Font Bureau [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude/styles|Amplitude]],
    which seems to have the same sort of 'ink traps' that I think I see in your book
    samples, although it is hard to be sure about that detail. The Amplitude letterform
    proportions seem about right.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
