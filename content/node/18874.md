  body: I have a bad art collection of my own in my studio, including a faux Van Gogh
    portrait of a woman who looks like she's covered in QT lotion (the original self
    tanner that turned you orange) and has a neck like a bendy straw. We have a fake
    Picasso, a fake Morandi, a painting of some Teenage Ninja Turtles, and a portrait
    of Bob Marley in front of a rising sun. But I'm not donating it to anybody.
