  body: I miss the Parkway.  <BR> <BR>They had a great old diner. I spent many Friday
    nights there,  <BR>drinking too much coffee, smoking too many cigarettes and  <BR>talking
    about type with a good friend of mine.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s long gone now, demolished
    to make way for the last few  <BR>miles of the U.S. Interstate Highway System.  <BR>
    <BR>All that&#39;s left is Chank&#39;s font.

  body: Heh, I just realised that the Parkway that inspired Chank was  <BR><i>not</i>
    the Parkway Motel, but the Parkway <i>Theater</i>, which still exists.  <BR>The
    rest is true, though. :-&#41;
