body: "I don't know much about typography, and I certainly wouldn't begin to try and
  work out a font on my own.  But I do know that I really don't like the fonts that
  get pushed on me from corporate America.  At least not for my printed, personal
  correspondence.  \r\n\r\nI don't like Arial, I don't like its successor, Calibri;
  and I hate using both in my personal correspondence.  I understand they look good
  on a myriad of computer screens, and thus will be the standard for e-mail for years
  and years to come.  I can live with that. But I actually still have people that
  I post written letters to, and am wondering if there are any really great alternatives.
  \ \r\n\r\nMy handwriting is atrocious, which makes reading letters from me more
  of a chore than a pleasure.  The reason I send certain things via snail mail has
  mostly do with the audience.  Most are old enough to remember when choosing Courier,
  Elite, or Pica was a revolution in convenience.  These are also people that I like
  to make a connection with, and would actually take the time to sit down and hand-write
  a letter if the result ever turned out legible.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm looking for a
  font that somehow conveys a certain warmth, familiarity, and homeyness.  Something
  that feels friendly.  Is that possible?\r\n\r\nI've played around with some scripts
  and handwriting fonts, but these seem either faked, forced, or are just hard to
  read. I've looked at some fonts that remind me of newspaper and book type, and like
  these better - I guess because I am a reader and these feel comfortable - but they
  also don't seem very personal or personable.\r\n\r\nSo, for all of the people here
  who obviously embrace typography as either a vocation or avocation, what do you
  use in your everyday correspondence, assuming you haven't completely gone over to
  the dark side of electronic correspondence?  Do you just use Arial, or have you
  found something that feels a lot more personal?  What is in your word processor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

    I\u2019m going to end up blind. If I\u2019m feeling especially motivated I might
    change over to a serif at a smaller size before printing."

  body: "I don't have a word processor; I'm lucky being in the design business that
    I have Adobe InDesign on my computer, and that's what I use to compose personal
    correspondence. As to the typeface, I use, at various times, Elysium, Centaur,
    Bembo, Garamond, Goudy Old Style. The italic of some fonts (such as Goudy Old
    Style) is particularly readable and you may find these warmer and more informal
    than the roman. Also, if you set the text ragged right, it won't seem as cold
    and formal as fully justified.\r\n\r\nThe trick when using proportional typefaces
    for correspondence, if you're putting them on 8.5\" x 11\" paper, don't make the
    text column six and a half inches wide. Four inches is much easier to read. I
    push this narrower column to the right and use the wide space on the left for
    drawing cartoons, printing pictures, recipes, etc."

  body: I've got Helvetica (14 pt) as the default on TextEdit, but if I'm actually
    sending out something that doesn't specify a typeface (some only want Times or
    Arial, for example), I usually use Palatino or Adobe Garamond.

  body: "Interesting thread. When I first went out on my own, I purchased and used
    Filosofia for my correspondence and invoices and other official correspondence.
    It was fantastic, at first. Then I grew more fond of, yes, Georgia in Microsoft
    Word. I think I was the only designer in the entire world that actually liked
    using Georgia because of its legibility in print and on screen. It really is a
    perfect in so many ways and I still contend that, despite it's faults, it can
    look good in print.\r\n\r\nUnsurprsingly, for the past year or so I've been using
    Mercury because it has a nice range of textures and captures a sense, to me, of
    casual formality."

    formatting."

  body: "Interesting thread indeed, especially for a non-designer like myself.\r\n\r\nI
    use Apex New for all my office work: letters, project summaries, and the like.
    It is extremely cool and contemporary, with a great color for this purpose especially
    in the Book weight.\r\n\r\nI use Cycles for most of my more literary work, especially
    books and scholarly articles. I find it subtle, well balanced at its various optical
    sizes and, again, with a great color and rhythm on the page."

  body: For business correspondance I use Freight (more sans than text) and InDesign.
    I don't like Word, and in TextEdit the font seems to be Helvetica at the moment.
    Emails go out in Lucida Grande.

  body: "For email, I use 14 pt Helvetica. Maybe I\u2019m getting older\u2014well,
    no <i>maybe</i> there\u2014but my eyes find that larger-sounding size more comfortable.
    I guess I\u2019ve just grown used to it; 14 pt does not seem huge to me any longer.
    And it\u2019s true that sans serif is easier to read on-screen, at the same time
    that serif type is easier on the eyes on a printed page.\r\n\r\nFor paper correspondence,
    Palatino has been my choice since the day I got my first Macintosh in November
    of 1989. I have always liked it\u2019s contours."

  body: "The interesting part of this thread are the responses.  Thanks to all who
    have posted so far, and to those who still might.  \r\n\r\nI feel Don McCahill's
    pain.  I manage my wife's medical practice, and had to redesign all the patient
    information forms.  Had I left it up to anyone else in the office, everything
    would use Arial.  I was real proud of myself for finding an appropriate font for
    headings and Verdana for text.\r\n\r\nThanks to Gary Long for the additional suggestions.
    \ I'm thinking that Goudy Old Style italicized is a winner.  Narrowing the print
    column in my letters: genius!\r\n\r\nI'm still re-thinking some of the fonts that
    I'm familiar with (eg Helvetica, Georgia) and tracking down those new to me (Brosio,
    Freight, Apex New, eg).\r\n\r\nSpire: You don't know what you are missing, man.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again.  There are probably three people in town that I could talk typography to
    (what little I know) and I'm not even sure who they would be. Sites like this
    are what make the internet great.\r\n"
