body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pic_sagmeister-s1_6413.jpg]\r\nSo I just
  recently read Stefan Sagmeister's book <em>Things I Have Learned in My Life So Far</em>.
  I really fell in love with the the whole concept of the book. One of my favorite
  pieces in the book was the piece by Marian Bantjes. I love the subtlety of the work
  and the curvilinear lines she used. I know that it's legibility is questionable,
  but I don't think that it is necessary in this piece. I love how fragile it seems.
  With just a single blow or brush of the hand it could be gone. The lack of permanence
  creates a delicate tension with the viewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pic_sagmeister-s6_4519.jpg]\r\nHere
  is another version that can be found on her website.It is definitely easier to read,
  however lacks the delicate aspects of the previous one. However I love this one
  because I think the type created in the sugar is really interesting and has a retro
  quality to it."
