  fonts. \r\n\r\nI need the names of all of these fonts, even the numbers. They all
  look very basic, so it shouldn't be hard. My brains fried from everything today!
  \r\n\r\nI would really, really appreciate any help you can give me. Thank you so
  much in advance! I have a feeling I'm going to be a frequent poster here, lol. "
