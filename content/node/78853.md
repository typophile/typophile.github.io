body: "This set of two woodtype improvisations, is printed in silver ink on Plike,
  the new sheet from Gruppo Cordenons.\r\nThe two designs are printed on the same
  sheet (8\"x6.375\"), but can be cut apart to make two 4\" postcards.\r\n(If I can
  find that perforating rule, I may perf them, but I don't know how well they would
  separate.)\r\n\r\nThese designs are printed directly with type from our original
  19th century Wood Type collection, along with small icons and copperplate cuts.
  They are 'improvisations' made in the moment, and printed on stock off cut from
  other jobs.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe paper, Plike, has a solid matte color and a unique
  rubberlike quality. Hardly the typical letterpress sheet, but it takes the ink and
  impression beautifully.\r\n\r\nPrinted on our 1930 Miehle V36 Cylinder Press at
  Slow Print Letterpress. http://slowprint.com \r\n\r\nAvailable at exquisiteletterpress.etsy.com\r\n\r\n<img
