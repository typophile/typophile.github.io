  (8/16/05) features none other than a slanted Comic Sans! You'd think that with Frank
  Miller directing it and with its dark themes they could have at least used a real
  comic font. \r\n\r\nYou can see the packaging <a href=http://www.dvdanswers.com/index.php?r=0&s=1&c=6614&n=1&burl=

  body: It doesn't stick out quite so badly next to the "Frank Miller's Sin City"
    logotype, but yeah, you're right, that's less than impressive. I'd blame that
    on Buena Vista's design department, though -- I kind of doubt Miller and Robert
    Rodriguez have much oversight over the DVD packaging.

    of other inappropriate usages that Comic Sans is used for (ie: a custom motorcycle/chopper
    shop near my house with Comic Sans on the signage)'

    that was based on comics) features not only a stretched-out Comic Sans MS, but
    CC JimLee, CC JoeMad, and at least two forms of Graphite as well. And that's just
    the \"comic book\" fonts.\r\n\r\nI have no idea why. It's a disheartening mess.\r\n\r\nI
    couldn't find an official online source for the full cover art, but if anyone
    wants to see it, it's available <a href=http://www.cdcovers.cc/dvd_a.php>here</a>."

  body: I think they were probably trying to mimic the profusion of lettering styles
    found on the average comic book page. I've been doing some production work for
    a comic company recently, and really good contemporary digital letterers use a
    pretty dizzying array of typefaces, and then modify them heavily as needed (especially
    for sound effects). It's a totally different world than traditional typography
    or sign lettering. The problem with the American Splendor covers is that they
    get caught halfway between typography and comic lettering, and the results are
    pretty ungainly. They get a B for effort, though!

  body: " I dunno, as much as I wanna jump on the bandwagon, comic sans has its place.
    and if its place is on cover of a comic book movie DVD, given it's familiarity
    to the general public. this kind of strikes me as a 'new ups logo hate' because
    it isn't rand. Given a little while, from what I've gathered on typophile, the
    new UPS logo is appropriate and NEEDED. Comic Sans does look like comic lettering
    ...\r\n\r\nJust  a thought."

  body: "I don't mind [[Comic Sans]] so much, but I still cannot stand the new UPS
    logo, or their use of FF Dax on their trucks. I kinda think a shipping service
    makes more sense being all conservative and frumpy. Conservative and frumpy means
    they're getting me my latest Amazon or Powell's fix on time, and I don't know
    what the hell their new identity is supposed to mean.\r\n\r\nComic Sans has no
    real relationship to \"real\" comic lettering, which is almost never as childlike
    and irregular as Comic Sans. I really don't think it's a terrible typeface (read
    the Typowiki entry, which I wrote), but it is misnamed."
