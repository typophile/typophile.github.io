body: "I've read a few books of case studies that show the process of the development
  of the designs, but I've never found one so extremely detailed as I would like.
  Ideally, I want a stream-of-consciousness account of the designers thoughts through
  the entire design process. Of course, writing that down isn't at all practical,
  so I'm not expecting anything close.\r\n\r\nI want something that explains why every
  little decision was made: Why was the type not three picas to the left? Why the
  bold weight rather than the medium or heavy? Why are the words capitalized? Why
  Adobe Garamond rather than Stempel Garamond? How were these exact shades of green
  and orange chosen?"

  body: "a book like that would either contain boring rubbish like \"we felt it had
    the right tone\" or \"because it fits into the overall style\" or it would be
    full of retrospective analysis that has little to do with the actual design process.\r\nat
    best such a book would tell you how to sell design to a client."
