    fonts</strong> are a font family based on the <strong>Vera Fonts</strong>. Its
    purpose is to provide a wider range of characters while maintaining the original
    look and feel through the process of collaborative development (see <a href=\"http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Authors\">authors</a>),
