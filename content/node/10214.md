  is a draft of the lowercase &#43; the letter H to set the cap height: <BR><a href="http://www.hackum.com/fonts/test1.gif">
  sample1</a> <BR> <BR>As usual, the &#34;s&#34; is no good &#40;yet&#41; and there
  are &#34;rough&#34; looking characters, so any comments appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks,'

  body: This is nice.. I like it.. <BR><i>&#40; In particular your &#39;g&#39; is
    lovely.. &#41;</i> <BR> <BR>&#40; I think you are right about the &#39;s&#39;
    needing some more work.. It seems slightly leaning towards the left, and the middle
    part may seem a bit uneven.. <i>Oh, and there is something about the lower part
    of the &#39;a&#39; that &#39;bothers&#39; me, but I cant really describe what
    that may be.. Maybe thats just me..</i> &#41;

  body: Whoa! I Firmin Didot &#39;g&#39; in a Lubalin Graph. Very interesting. <BR>Did
    you mean to dip your &#39;t&#39; below the baseline?

  body: Stephen, I just noticed the &#34;t&#34; and fixed it, thanks. As for the Didot&#39;s
    &#34;g&#34; ... well, I thought it might work in a font like this one and give
    it some character. <BR> <BR>Dav, I am not quite happy with the &#34;a&#34; either,
    there are some variations with smaller counters, which I am still considering.
    And the &#34;s&#34; is always hard for me. I will probably get back to it afer
    the capitals. <BR> <BR>My idea was to draw one more weight apart from this one
    - &#40;25% thinner&#41; and another one with shorter serifs.

  body: Cool. <BR>For the &#34;g&#34;, try a join that&#39;s a straight vertical&#42;
    instead of that half-oval. <BR> <BR>&#42; Maybe with a rightward serif at the
    bottom connection though. <BR> <BR>hhp
