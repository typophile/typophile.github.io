    are sort of similar. But not very."

  body: Indeed hard to pinpoint, on first look it reminded me of T26 fonts, I suggest
    you look at their [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/style/Grunge|Grunge]] and [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/style/Organic|Organic]]
    sections.

  body: Is there a font closer to this than XBAND Rough? I'd link to a showing of
    that font, but I can only find downloads and I'm not sure if the font's commercial
    or not. XBAND seems too... straight, for lack of a better word. However, XBAND
    is what I thought of when I saw this. Perhaps that will help in identifying the
    true font in use here?

  body: "@ Arun\r\nInteresting, I also didn't think it would be such a challenge,
    I did find a fairly close match in [[http://www.typefetish.com/typefaces/parcel.html|Parcel]]
    from TYPEfetish, but again not exact.\r\n\r\n@ Luke\r\nIf you are really trying
    to match that XBand font, you should take a look at T26 as mentioned, or at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/typochondriac/regular/|Typochondriac]],
    or at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/phatphonts/demented-avenger/demented-avenger/|Demented
    Avenger]], or use myfonts fantastic feature [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/phatphonts/demented-avenger/morelikethis.html|more
    fonts like this]]. \r\n\r\nGood Luck."

  body: Not trying to match XBAND. Parcel's pretty close. Might have to purchase that
    one, still I'd prefer a closer/exact match. I tried the "more like this" option
    and did not find anything better than Parcel. Does anyone have any ideas?

    Confidential]], which is pretty much the same sort of look.

  body: "FF Confidential looks to be what XBAND is an imitation/copy of, I think.
    That's handy to know, but for what I'm doing I'll purchase Parcel. Shame it looks
    like there's only the one weight.\r\n\r\nJust quickly if any of you know. Is there
    any sort of plugin for Photoshop that lets you pivot/tilt individual characters
    so that I could achieve the above look? I'm finding it hard to describe that but
    hopefully you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nOf course, I want to say, thanks guys for
    the help so far. Merry Christmas as well. :)"
