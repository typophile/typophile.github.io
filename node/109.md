  <BR> <BR>This page, and image posted here after show a current group project of
  my type design students, Ensad, Paris &#40;3 hours by week course&#41;. As usual,
  the end of the year, the students have so much to finish, they don&#39;t seems serious
  as it need to finish it! Anyway, its where they are. And its seems interesting to
  see what the world &#40;Typophile IS the world!&#41; say about it? <BR> <BR>Its
  a revival of a late 19th century french typeface, from a foundry called Fonderie
  Bertrand, who probably be purchased by Peignot later. Some of the caps proportions
  are strange, like the B or M. <BR> <BR>My question is do we need to stick to this
  strange proportions, or need to correct them?  <BR> <BR>The serif structure came
  from a friendly confrontation between three groups of students &#40;after a close
  observation of some results of cutting technics&#41;. It seems to work for lc, less
  in some caps, I think about C, G, S, E at vertical position? What do you think?
  <BR> <BR>Any others comments welcome, despite, we don&#39;t know what can be done
  to correct after your comments. Only next friday of work and the typeface need to
  be achieved. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10688.gif"

    typefaces&#41;, but you might correct optical things: color issues &#40;like in
    the UC &#34;V&#34;&#41;, the lc &#34;k&#34; join, etc. <BR> <BR>One thing I wonder
    about is the descender depths: maybe it&#39;s nice to have them different? But
    if they&#39;re made the same, the &#34;y&#34; is the best one to match. <BR> <BR>The
    serif structure on the other hand seems to clash too much with the overall style.

    in a gif. The color in a -&#62; n looks alot more consistant thatn o -&#62; z
    . Also the numerals seem slightly dark compared to the a -&#62; n set.  <BR> <BR>Oh,
    maybe a slightly darker terminal on the a. <BR> <BR>Fun! <BR>Randy

    wide to me. <BR> <BR>The numerals are wonderful, except that &#34;5&#34; seems
    a bit narrow. Perhaps angling the top a bit could create an illusion of being
    wider without destroying the graceful curve below. <BR> <BR>Nice work! <BR> <BR>David

  body: So fast as usual! My answers go to various points made by all of you. Thanks
    a lot, the students will appreciate, that the job they done is appreciated elsewhere
    than in their classroom! <BR> <BR>Use this link for the pdf of the gif posted
    here. Don&#39;t look to close to the forms, they are done from various methods,
    softwares, various students! <BR> <BR><a href="http://perso.ensad.fr/~ensadtypo/imagesbertrand/Bertrandtest090503.pdf"

    <BR> <BR>Ok, lets kept the serifs. Not sure to understand what Hrant say in its
    last sentence? <BR> <BR>Yes, the proportions of the caps are odd, but they are
    like that in such late century typefaces, very large mono width caps, such we
    found on earliers Sans too. The S was not on our sample &#40;I think&#41;, and
    indeed, we&#39;ve done it too narrow! <BR> <BR>But, your comments convince me
    that the B, P, R are really to large for today eyes. We will make them more narrow
    a bit enough to kept this strange feature, without to be disturbing too much.
    <BR> <BR>Yes, Hrant, the k need to be corrected, i don&#39;t asked them to correct
    it yet!! Some others glyphs need to be corrected too. The ampersand is a pure
    invention from the student who have done the figures... <BR> <BR>Normally, the
    figures follow an intermediate weight between caps and lc &#40;its what i say
    during teaching&#41;. But, its possible that some are to heavy. <BR> <BR>Yes I
    like quite a lot the numerals! the five in particularly. You right David, we make
    it little more wider. <BR> <BR>thanks again!  <BR> <BR>

    feature vertical axis caps when the lc are quite oblique axis? <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    I agree with most of your comments: make less strange, but still strange. <BR>
    <BR>What do you think about the Question mark? Not too soft?'

  body: '&#62; proportions ... are like that in such late century <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    actually where I think the serifs don&#39;t fit in. On the other hand, it&#39;s
    what makes the face most original... <BR> <BR>Looking at the PDF: I think the
    color is slightly light for text. It seems to be asking for slightly looser spacing,
    but that would weaken the overall &#40;more&#41;, so darkening instead should
    help. <BR> <BR>BTW, The Asterisk is very nice. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Good point about Times, J-F. <BR>About the question mark, yes, a little less
    soft would be better. <BR>In the other hand, the paragraph mark could be softer.

    at the time, light page generally, at least in France -- despite, in this case,
    they pretend that is a OldStyle! The spacing is not done, it will help perhaps?
    <BR> <BR>Same feelings about question mark. Thanks too.'

  body: The irregularity of the serifs and the angles aren&#39;t so disparate that
    they need to be made the same. The only thing that catches my eye from my printout
    is the odd character widths. And really, they aren&#39;t so odd. For the question
    mark, I don&#39;t think it is too soft, but what if the front &#40;top&#41; end
    was trimmed flat and the back &#40;bottom&#41; end was left soft? Maybe this would
    make it match the somewhat irregular serifs?? I also like the color when it is
    printed. Maybe a little light for book work at the smallest point-size, I can
    see that, but maybe only just.  <BR> <BR>I printed this out on a 600dpi laserprinter.

  body: hmm. Sorry.  <BR> <BR>The &#39;v&#39; and the &#39;w&#39; seem to be sticking
    their chins out. That is, if the bottom apex were chins. Falling backwards, leaning
    backwards a bit. <BR> <BR>The more I look, the more I really enjoy the serifs.
    Don&#39;t change those.
