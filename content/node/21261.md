  body: "I love it too. Too bad the wood won't survive outdoors and the \"C\" doesn't
    stand on it's own. So the kerning between \"I\" and \"C\" is screwy.\r\n\r\nBut
    so yummy nonetheless. \r\n\r\nOh yes, my dog's in the picture for scale. "

    put it on his blog. \r\n\r\nhttp://houseind.com/showandtell/index.php?id=224\r\n\r\nYes,
    I thought of painting it, but I'm gonna enjoy it raw for a while. The whitewash
    it, then paint it bright red!\r\n\r\nTiff, they're on a book shelf in the office.
    With negative kerning cos the shelf's too narrow. \r\n\r\nPolyurethane stain?
    I'll research that. But the wood's really old and not really solid.\r\n"
