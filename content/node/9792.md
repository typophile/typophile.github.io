body: Hi,everybody. I&#39;m showing you a logo I created for a photostudio of a friend
  of mine in Brazil. The name is &#34;Olhodepeixe&#34;, which in English would be
  &#34;Fisheye&#34; &#40;olho=eye and peixe=fish&#41;.  <BR>The idea was to refer
  to the wide-angle lens that have the same name. However, the photographer didn&#39;t
  want any fish in the visual identity, we both agreed that it would be too literal
  and silly. <BR>Therefore I came up with a reference to the wide angle lens, which
  is also a &#40;not so&#41; subtle image of an eye. I wanted a strong and simple
  logo, to be applied in any color, so I&#39;m sending you the black version. <BR>Well,
  I would like to see your opinion and suggestions to improve or even change it radically.
  I&#39;m sure it will help me. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Daniel Cabral<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67482.gif"

  body: Daniel did you try just a fisheyed effect on the type. I have a plugin for
    Illustrator called FilterIt and I could create a fisheyed effect in about 1 minute.

  body: 'The typeface you choose seems too rigid in relation with the name and the
    photography sector. May be is the use of caps letters.  I agreed with Daniel,
    the D is hard to discover &#40;too much inside the '

  body: Yeah, I tried a fisheyed effect, but it seemed too silly &#40;children sutff&#41;,
    or too psychodelic for me. But I will try again with the plug-in.  <BR> <BR>And
    AndrZ, what do you mean by &#34;something with curve&#34;? Could you explain it
    to me? And thanks, I will try not to use only caps. <BR> <BR>Daniel

    to illustrate the idea.  <BR> <BR>Hoping those will help you to go in front. <BR>
