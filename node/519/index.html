		<div class="commentbody">I think there is more weight in Hudson's posting, but I can't be sure. Hudson's sample is scanned, and is what I believe what they call  aliased - it has half-tone pixels around it. I think he said it was 14 point, but to match it on screen I had to type 60 point Adobe Caslon. So with all this scaling, I don't have the technical know-how to say how the originals would compare. But in my test, yes, John Hudson's sample of the 1924 Caslon in general seemed to have more weight, but it wasn't consistent.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Hudson's 1924 sample is significantly different from my sample of Linotype Caslon Old Face, and from the printed sample I have of metal Caslon 337, which I am assuming your digital version matches. I am pretty sure it is more regularized than the Linotype or your version - or, I suspect, the work of old William himself.</div>

Using the macro lense, I can pretty much fill the frame with a couple of 14pt punches, which is pretty good for a relatively inexpensive and portable camera. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding Adobe Caslon, I believe you are correct in characterising it as a kind of amalgamation of details from many different sizes of the metal type. The was Adobe's approach at that time and is also seen in their Garamond.

		<div class="commentbody">Looking again at the relatively heavy impression in the 1924 specimen, I'm reminded that the revival of interest and usage of Caslon Old Face in Britain was initiated, in the late 19th century, by the Chiswick Press. I used to have a copy of a Chiswick Press edition of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Golden <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the printing was very heavy. They used a large size of Caslon, possibly 18pt but certainly no smaller than 14pt, and a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> black ink. This may have contributed to a fashion for over-inking Caslon in Britain to make it look heavier.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wonder if it was just in fashion to over-ink &quot;all types&quot; in England and not just Caslon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hired an Englishman, generally a good pressman but I was never happy at the quantity of ink. It's not that I am cheap, black does not cost much and it goes far. But many pressman overink. Scott Fruetel formerly of Spring Valley Press was a superb Monotype Keyboard operator and pressman.  Friend of Clifford Burke, had another characteristic which was &quot;almost&quot; as bad. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He would &quot;underink&quot;. His type was sharp but the printing looked like it was through a washer. So there are many opinions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My personal taste is well known. I leaned towards the qualities of Font le Roy. He was John Henry Nash's pressman. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But that point I am tired of labouring.

		<div class="commentbody">The fashion in 'fine' printing in Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was heavily influenced by Morris and St John Hornby, of course, who both favoured blackletter and what might be called the Italian black roman, derived from the Schweynheym &amp; Pannartz types. Heavy black type driven deeply into heavy rag paper was the style of the day, and probably made a lasting impression (sorry for the pun) on generations of British printers, even when they were using types not intended for this kind of treatment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry I missed you in Vancouver, Gerald.

		<div class="commentbody">david <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had completely forgotten about this, and did not at first understand that yours was the initiating post here. Last year I had published an article on &quot;digital type with an affinity for letterpress&quot; for <em>Parenthesis</em> that included a review of Founder's Caslon and dfTYPE's Rialto. In that I state that the Adobe Caslon was based on Caslon foundry specimens sheets from 1738 and 1786. This information would have come from an earlier review I did on the initial Adobe Originals releases. Carter's Big Caslon was based on titling sizes that appeared in the famous broadsheet specimen of 1734. The metal typeface, Lanston Monotype Caslon Oldstyle 337 is considered the &quot;closed rendition&quot; to the [American] Laurence J Johnson Caslon (1859), which was derived from &quot;borrowed Caslon foundry punches,&quot; and which marked the beginning of the American Caslon revival. This was inspired by the British revival of Caslon in 1844 through its use in Chiswick Press books. Caslon had fallen out of popularity by the nineteenth century. The Caslon specimen book of 1805 does not show the Old Style typeface. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald Lange</div>

This is because I design type myself, and appreciate the letterforms for their own sake in a way that the layman doesn't (and shouldn't have to). I also prefer darkish letterforms, but on the type design side, not the printing side: the latter is counter to my fidelity preference. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the point is that what I prefer is moot. When I create/print a piece, it is targeted at a certain demographic (and that's never me).

		<div class="commentbody">I've never understood why, economic considerations apart, the digital font makers have generally chosen to revive earlier adaptations rather than going back to source. Lanston's so-called authentic Caslon, for instance, is an authentic rendering *not* of the types cut by William Caslon I and his son, but of Lanston Monotype's twentieth-century rendering &ndash; of types probably supplied not by Caslon &amp; Co, but by an American foundry which had, in the mid-nineteenth century, acquired strikes of variable authenticity to the original designs. What's authentic about that? My recollection of the Caslon Challenge, incidentally, is that it involved comparison between (1) Lanston's digital cutting, and (2) Lanston's original cutting. It wasn't a comparison of Lanston's digital, and Caslon's original - perhaps Gerald Giampa could clarify? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why revive a twentieth-century interpretation, influenced by the aesthetic of the 1920s, rather than go back to the original and start over? Going back to the original you can either create an interpretation for our own time (as Twombly has done, using ) or else attempt a facsimile (as in my own Founder's Caslon. I don't, for instance, see that it's really legitimate to use a digital version of Centaur, when there's an opportunity to go back to Bruce Rogers' source material, and improve on his rendering. If we need type revivals (I'm not saying that we do) let's revive types that were true to their own time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe brought out a small publication in 1990, titled <em>Adobe Caslon</em> (California, Adobe Systems Incorporated, 1990), in which it's clear that Adobe Caslon, designed by Carol Twombly for use in sizes ranging from 6 to 14pt, was based on photographic enlargements of the 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 pt designs shown in Jones 1924. Twombly `found that the proportions of x-height to capital height and ascender and descender length varied only slightly from size to size within this text range. She made careful sketches of every letter at each size, and after this thorough examination of the types, made rough drawings for one master design that incorporated common elements from the five original text sizes. The letterforms were drawn at a weight between the extremes of the sharp metal impressions observed under the microscope, and the overweight, amorphous shapes of the enlarged letters.' The Caslon Ornaments were adapted for Adobe by Wesley Tanner. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The st ligature, which someone's asked about, was never offered by the Caslon foundry. In the eighteenth century, until at least the 1780s, use of the long s was all but mandatory in most English printing (there are a few interesting exceptions), which meant that the ligature offered by Caslon was longs-t. I'm not sure who first added one to a version of Caslon, however: I've a vague memory of seeing something in a book printed by Field and Tuer in the 1880s, but a more likely culprit would be ATF, who added some luxuriantly nasty swash characters to their fonts of Caslon - some of which were taken over by Lanston, Adobe, et al. I'm rather ashamed of the fact that I included short st in my Founder's Caslon, though it does come with a health warning in the documentation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm writing, I should say, without access to most of the books I'd usually refer to, and realise that I may have confused details of the American Caslons. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Justin Howes</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's quite OK for a Caslon to lack bold - Caslon didn't have one, but instead printers used 'black letter'. &gt;From what I remember of it, Bitstream Caslon is one of the worst around. The descenders have been absurdly shortened, and the lining figures are another horror. Avoid it! Caslon <em>needs</em> small caps, non-lining figures, ligatures, and sensitive handling. It's not worth spending time, as a typographer, with substandard fonts.</div>
