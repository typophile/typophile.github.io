  body: "Also rather close to <a href=\"http://dstype.com/privapro.html\">Priva</a>
    (note the slanted terminals), boldened/squooshed.\r\nWhile the \"a\" is off in
    the MyFonts sample below, the sample at DSType site \r\nlinked to above shows
    an \"a\" with a matching foot; I'd guess that's an alternate.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PrivaFour_5942.png]"

  body: "Hmm, yes it is close to Prelo. It seems to me that altaira is right, looks
    like its an altered Priva. It looks like it could have been stretched out or squished
    down.\r\n\r\nWell, thanks guys.\r\n\r\nJonE."

  body: "Well I'm not sure how closely you need to ID this; I think Priva is a decent
    approximation, but it isn't it.\r\nFor one thing, the tops of the stems above
    the join on the \"n\" and \"m\" are thinned in your sample, which Priva's aren't.
    Also, on a more visible level, the counters of \"n\" and \"m\" are much more curvy
    in your sample (i.e. less thinning of the curves). \r\n:-|\r\n"

  body: "No, you're right for sure. Its not Priva line for line, curve for curve but
    its close enough.\r\n\r\nI thank both of you.\r\n\r\nJonE."
