body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to get some feedback on this. It is an identity redesign
  for an Irish pub I work at called 'The Field'. The pub resembles an Irish farmhouse
  or cottage and is very rustic and homely - extremely unique and traditional. They
  have been in business for over 7 years and have quite a poor and hacked up Celtic
  blackletter logotype at the moment. They are renowned for great food and music.\r\n\r\nThe
  type is set in a modified version of Device's Sparrowhawk which was traced and scanned
  to give it a handlettered feel. The tagline is set in Steelplate Gothic Shaded.
  The parchment is quite likely to be the treatment so I thought it should be in there.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJay\r\n\r\nNEW
  LOGO:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/field_hndltr_3863.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD

    opinions I reckon both versions could do something with the \"The\" to make it
    a more interesting composition. Personally I prefer the different sized letters
    and upper and lower case on the old logo and think you might want to look at some
    other typefaces as the one you have isn't really saying \"very rustic and homely\"
    to me at the moment. Best wishes.\t"

  body: "The placement of \"the\" does look awkward poised on top of the F. So in
    terms of layout I like the bottom sample best. I like the type you used for Irish
    Pub and Eatery on the first one, but the type for \"Field\" doesn't work with
    it in my opinion. \r\n\r\nYou might consider staying away from the uncial types
    as they seem rather cliche for an Irish pub. I don't know what your decor there
    is like, but a lot of Irish pubs have the feel of early 20th century. It might
    be worth considering a type treatment along those lines if thats the case. Sort
    of what you might see on an old bottle of whiskey.\r\n\r\nStephen Rapp"

    But I do think that the layout on Sihep's version is stronger.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback guys. \r\n\r\nSihep: \r\nAgree with you about the
    'the'. As for the 'rustic and homely' - I guess I neglected to say that the pub
    is the most authentic and rustic Irish pub in the area. The key differentiator
    is the fact it is really Irish, so I wanted to maintain that in the type.\r\nSo
    Stephen - I know it is cliched to use uncial type BUT the pub is not early 20th
    century by any means - much more 18th century and Celtic country!\r\n\r\nI am
    working on some alternates but keep the comments coming.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    and traced it to soften it and make it less clinical. I will post a sample untraced
    and unmodified.

    right Jayy I don't think you can avoid it. Please just try stay away from using
    a typeface like Helvetica for the tag line. \r\n\r\nIf your going to keep it authentic

    logo. I do like Colmcille though. That's why I picked Sparrowhawk - it has Celtic
    accents but is not blackletter, it's gothic. Colmcille has roman accents which
    looks a bit 20th century.\r\n\r\nTomorrow I will post plenty of alternates."

    do you reckon makes it kinda disjointed? I like the combo of Sparrowhawk and Steelplate.

  body: "It's starting to get busy... too busy. It doesn't feel congruent. There seems
    to be 3-4 different elements/styles working, but not well, together. \r\n\r\nThe
    Field from your original post is much better than the current version, all it
    needed was a little more roughing. I would have ran it through the photocopier
    a few times to give it some \"antiquing\". \r\n\r\nThe Irish Pub & Eatery byline
    stands out way too much. While the style is sharp and unique it isn't very \"Irish\"
    feeling. I'd stay with a more organic, earthy approach. The Irish are Earthy people
    and the current style feels very rigid and well, stylish.\r\n\r\nAnd the Banyan
    Tree is just over the top... very heavy and throws the entire layout a little
    out of whack. It also seems very clean. It needs tossed in the mud and then backed
    over with the car a few times. \r\n\r\nJust giving my honest impressions, nothing
    against you Jay or your abilities. I'd take this as a true opportunity. It's not
    often one gets to create a logo for an Irish establishment. I'd really do some
    research, visit some other local Irish establishments, sample the delectable Irish
    fare and beverages. Have some Single Malt Scotch and Guinness or 2. Practice your
    brogue when talking to friends and relatives. Wear some plaid, or atleast some
    green and if it's not too cold, hit the links. All in the name of research! "

  body: "Asvetic,\r\n\r\nThank you for your frank critique. I do want to antique it
    for sure, but want to get the type and treatment correct first. I feel the tagline
    would loose legibility at smaller sizes were it any smaller. The tree, as fussy
    as it is, is stylistically subjective. I have seen many logos in recent years
    published and recognized for their brilliance that have much fussier graphical
    treatments that I hated. So I can see your argument.\r\n\r\nAnd not to sound conceited...BUT...I
    am Irish, from Dublin. Have been to more Irish pubs than I would like to admit,
    drank more Guinness, Irish Whiskey (Scotch is from Scotland btw as is plaid),
    have a natural Irish accent and have been immersed in so much Irish culture while
    in the US and at home that I think I would bleed green if cut.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    you not being Irish and the target market not being Irish but the sort that are
    of Irish ancestry and think Scotch is from Ireland, may also not get it.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing I hate is the total tackiness of any of the Irish/American crap I see. Despite
    a lot of research, I have not been able to find any Irish pub logos that I like
    - with the exception of [[ http://www.fadoirishpub.com/|Fado]] which I feel is
    contemporary and represents a modern and progressive Ireland and not the backward
    tack you see most places.\r\n\r\nMichael,\r\nWhat did you mean by 'imagine it
    without the serifs'?\r\nWe just got Belhaven this week :) Got to wait to finish
    our Czechvar before we can put it on line though. It is so good with the nitro

    I would use it in a logo, but for almost 30 years people have demanded that I
    hand letter their requests... so I have never had a chance. I bought the font
    when I bought my second computer... haven't ever even used it but I love to look

    had 4 quarts and 8 shots of Irish whiskey at my rehearsal dinner. Needless to

    Also, I didn't mean to offend by mixing my countries together. \r\n\r\nHaving
    that out of the way, I agree with you on the front that Americanized Irish Pubs
    don't have a clue when it comes to their signage. But, I do also like the Fado's
    logo. There's a Fado's in Philly I've been to on occasion.\r\n\r\nIf it's Fado's
    that you like, I'd suggest following their example. The logo is simple, but rustic
    without being overloaded. And there aren't mixed styles. If you create a solid
    identity, then the idea of The Field being an Irish Pub and Restuarant should
    be understood without having being said.\r\n\r\nYou might have approached this
    idea already, but what if you created a field, and have a simpler Banyan Tree
    as the center point. I'm picturing shafts of wheat on both sides. Then include
    a weathered version of The Field positioned next to this illustrated field.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    just a suggestion. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers. When I see a design posted

    It's kind of like people craving pizza for dinner. More often than not, they will
    go to the store with the green, white and red sign...why? because it's Italian!
    They have a rep for making the best pizza! ( and they do generally make really

    coming off too harsh, I don't mean to at all. I'm just a big believer that it's
    best to accent the strengths of a business in their logo if at all possible. An
