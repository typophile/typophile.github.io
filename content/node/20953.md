body: I 'd like to create an animation similar to the one shown on the right (the
  typeradio.org logo) for a lettering-looking logo (where there are almost no edges
  and thus no starting or ending point). I can guess it's made on Flash with several
  masks running over the logo, but I was wondering whether there is another way to
  do it ... (with another tool perhaps  - such as After Effects - and then exported
  to .swf)
