body: "Hello,\r\nI have been trying to id the font used by the US Army on their K
  ration boxes during WWII. This font also appears on other boxes, such as ammunition
  crates. While there is some slight variation to the fonts on original boxes I have
  seen, I have uploaded a typical box end. If it helps, the \"KS\" is 2\" tall while
  the other letters are 3/4\" tall. Although I classified this font as sans serif,
  the \"S\" and \"2\" do have serifs to distinguish them from \"5\" and \"Z\". \r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\r\n\r\nDon Eaton[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ration_Crate_-_K_Rations_001-551x440_3841.jpg]"

    \ Everything is in heavy straight lines; no curves. \r\nEasy to create in a font.
    \r\nBank Gothic is too light so I found something with a heavier weight to match
    the \"KS.\" \r\nI adapted Liberator \"a wartime inspired sans serif\" by Ryan
    Clark from the Lost Type Co-op; http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=liberator\r\nAll
    I did to it was to square up the angled corners and do some minor tinkering mainly
    to \"2\" and \"3.\"\r\nTo match the lighter weight of the other parts, I would
    use something intermediate in weight between Liberator and Bank Gothic.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KSRations_4136.jpg]\r\nDon"

    Use parallel lines to thin the letters. Set here at 20 points:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KSRationsReg_3939.jpg]"
