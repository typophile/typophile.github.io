  body: I think you should make bigger your post, I can&#39;t almost see it. But I
    don&#39;t think it is a DIN, look at the &#34;g&#34;

  body: I agree with Adriano&#39;s post. Apex Sans has the curved i and l, as well
    as the right a, e and g to match this sample. I checked through my Sans Serif
    ID Guide &#40;<a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html" target="_blank">http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html</a>&#41;
    and didn&#39;t find any others that met this set of characteristics. More letters
    would always help, of course.

    it is Apex Sans indeed!
