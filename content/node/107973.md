    body: "Very similar, but I don't think it can be a version of Laudatio as I don't
      think it was around in 1976 when this version was originally published. Could
      easily be wrong though.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to figure it out for a while
      now and I can't tell if it's an existing or custom typeface. There are some
      very small differences between some of the characters but that could be down
      to flaws in the photosetting process as they are very small... "

  body: " As far as I can determine the first use of this cover was in the Bodley
    Head first edition in 1976. This suggests lettering or  a photo lettering font,
    probably not digitized.\r\nFriedrich Poppl (1923-1982) had a background in calligraphy
    and designed a font for Bethold in 1982, sold as Laudatio, which is similar. It
    is plausible that the Bodley Head drew on some earlier work by Poppl, either directly
    or via a photo lettering company.\r\nI tried to duplicate the title by tinkering
    with Laudatio BQ Medium, but compression [70%] yields only:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PopplLaudatioCondMed70pct_4869.jpg]\r\nwhich
    is rather different, particularly the lowercase -- not square enough, x-height
    too low etc. For ease of reference I have included the lowercase y which has some
    similarity to the Y in the cover letters.\r\nDon"
