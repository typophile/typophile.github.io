  for a book cover. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/covertype-tp_3656.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  overall design (which has colors, and a photo, and stuff) has already been approved;*
  so this is just the type I'm now working on, which is all custom to varying degrees.\r\n\r\n*
  Actually, I'll have to submit a \"prefinal\" version of this tomorrow, for inclusion
  in the publisher's catalog. I'm expecting to be tweaking micro stuff between then
  and whenever I have to submit the final print files.\r\n\r\nThe headline was customized
  from Miso (Miso on top, my headline below):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/miso-neuro-tp_4899.gif]\r\n\r\nAnything
  that strikes you as odd/wrong?\r\n(I'm particularly wondering if the \"S\" is too
  wonky and/or wide, the \"K\" too wide, and the \"N\" too heavy?)\r\n\r\nThe font
  in the subline and author's name is my own work-in-progress, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/53395\">Ernestine</a>,
  in a special cut (slightly heavier, and more display-ish, than the base cut, and
  the \"ft\" lig is new). \r\nThis is going to be its first public appearance, so
  I'd be extra grateful for any opinions and comments!\r\n\r\n-Nina"

    I'm not sure of the context.\r\n\r\nKu looks a bit loose but the ball might be
    stopping them go closer. This K is somehow more convincing than the original cut.
    ft is lovely.\r\n\r\nI think you've done the right thing modifying the Miso. The
    A and H fit much better. I can't help with the spacing; I just can't see spacing
    so it always looks fine to me. Perhaps it looks tighter at the start of the word.\r\n"

  body: "Cheers Ben!\r\n\r\nThe thing reads: <em>Neuro-Aesthetics. Art, [the] brain,
    [and] science.</em> (Does that ever sound stupid in English; it works better in
    German.)\r\nFirst I had it with a comma and an ampersand, but the client said
    they want hyphens. Then I had middots, and they did look nice &ndash; but, the
    client said they want hyphens. But of course hyphens are grammatically wrong,
    so now they get dashes. I'm hoping they can't tell the difference, so at least
    I won't have to get into that argument.\r\n\r\n\"K\": There's less optical correction
    in this cut, so the arm isn't as thin. I admit it looks a lot nicer up close;
    it's just that at text sizes, the correction seems necessary to my printer. Dunno\u2026\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Perhaps
    it looks tighter at the start of the word.\"</cite>\r\nDang, you're right. \"NE\"
    is a lot tighter than \"IK\".\r\nSomehow I always get really hard headlines to
    space. But I guess spacing just *is* hard. Better get used to it :-)"

    not right :)\r\nTo me it seems the \"neuro\" part needs a micro space less, and
    also OA (it looks like you want to brake the 2 words apart) and AS (it seems the
    S is going to spin (or fall) clockwise)... the THETIK part looks good to me :P
    just some thoughts..."

    too.\r\nSounds like an interesting book!"

  body: ":-) Thanks for the pointers! (I'm not an expert either, especially not on
    spacing!)\r\n\r\n<cite>\"it looks like you want to brake the 2 words apart\"</cite>\r\nActually,
    that was probably on my mind, not to make that \"break\" too tight. On the other
    hand, the \"NEURO\" will be black, and the \"\xC4STHETIK\" knocked out of the
    background image, so they'll probably be pulled apart enough without any help
    from the spacing ;)\r\n\r\nI'll have a closer look at the pairs you mentioned
    \u2013 thanks!"

    K.\r\n\r\nTo my eye the \"e\"s in Ernestine have too much space before them (the
    \"Ge\" pair in Gehirn and \"se\" pair in Wissenschaft).\r\nSorry to hear you are
    working with another unenlightened client.\r\n\r\nGood luck with the project and
    with Ernestine."

    the spacing pointer Edward. (BTW, did you use to have some nice Miyazaki creature
    as an avatar, or am I mixing you up with somebody else?) \r\nErnestine isn't properly
    spaced yet, and I tried to even it out in this thing\u2026 \r\nbut I'm a bit worried
    about being somewhat space-blind. :-\\"
