  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Does anyone know of any studies done on [[legibility]] that show that
Body copy larger than 9, 10, 11 pt (like for instance 12 point Helvetica) 
are actually harder to read? (I prefer reading text that is between 8-10 pt),</p>
<p>If I am designing a layout to a book or magazine I would use 8 pt if
editors/clients would let me. Leaving more room for photos, captions, to
breath. I&rsquo;ve recently been forced to use 12 point type and it  looks so
horsey to me.</p>
<p>My theory is if its body copy is larger than 11pt its actually harder 
Read because as your eyes sweep over the lines of text you can’t see
As many words at one time. I also think it might be harder to read
Larger body copy because when its too big you start seeing individual
Letterforms instead of words.  (They say that speed readers see 5 or 6 
Words at a time).</p>
<p>(I am hoping there has been a test that confirms this
—aesthetically working with larger sizes 
of body copy always makes the over all layout look clunky— I want to 
be able to tell people that the idea that larger body copy is easy to read
is a fallacy.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You are absolutely right. When type becomes too large, the number of words on each line becomes too small. This  means that the eye has to spend a lot of time jumping from line-end to line-start instead of actually reading. Also, almost  all (i can&rsquo;t think of any who don&rsquo;t) typefaces have a limited range of size in which they work well. Typefaces for body text usually don&rsquo;t work well when set too large, they tend to become unelegant and too low-contrast (when using a serif typeface). The opposite is the case when setting titling typefaces too small – the small details become too small and may disappear in print.</p>
<p>But when it comes to determining the &ldquo;ultimate body copy&rdquo; size, that&rsquo;s just impossible. If you line up a variety of typefaces in the same size, say 11pt, they will all look different in size due to their different x-heights.</p>
<p>good luck on convincing your editors :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the most important point (!) is that point size alone means very little.</p>
<p>First of all x-height tells you more about legibility, as mentioned. But also length of line and leading makes a crucial difference. Also sans vs serif.</p>
<p>I know some people get in their heads that point size is everything. I think the only way to disabuse them of that idea is to show them several side-by-side versions of type actually set in a paragraph.</p>
<p>That being said I think that the most common mistake of those who don&rsquo;t work with type is that &ldquo;Make It Bigger&rdquo; (title of Paula Sher&rsquo;s book) solves all problems. On the other hand, I do think that graphic designers sometimes make the opposite mistake. Because they want the overall page to look nice, they make the type too small or low contrast (colors, reversed, etc.) for good readability. You can definitely sin in both directions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wish I could start this thread over and re-phrase my question.</p>
<p>Yes, point size is a meaningless number. Let&rsquo;s be specific&ndash; I&rsquo;m currently working with Adobe Garamond pro on a book about Napier New Zealand&ndash; I was told to use 12 point by editors&ndash; but it looked huge and awkward, no room for white space, everything looked cramped on the A4 size pages&ndash;</p>
<p>I also have to put in  photos and captions. When I reduce the point size down to 10 on 13 Garamond&ndash; the two page spread looks so much better. (9pt looks even better)</p>
<p>As for audience &ndash; it&rsquo;s not the visually impaired, or the elderly, or children&ndash; its meant for a very general audience ages 20-40.</p>
<p>So, if you want to do a test&mdash; a typical spread (two A4 size pages) in this book has 1100-1300 words, with 4 photos with captions 40-60 words. There is a title, subtitle. Try designing a good looking spread (two A4 pages)&ndash; with 12 point Garamond&ndash; then do it with 10 pt &ndash; see which one looks horsey. See which one is easier to read.
(What you are going to find is that on spreads with 1300 words with 12 pt type you will have to reduce the leading to get all the words on the page- it begins to look amateurish).</p>
<p>But aesthetics aside&hellip;.
&ndash; The whole point of my post&ndash; really, is to find out if there has been any study that body copy set to match the size of  12 pt garamond is not easier to read than type set to the size of  9 or 10 pt Adobe Garamond pro. (for people who are not vision impaired, over the age of 60 or under the age of 8.)</p>
<p>I would love to know if there is a 
test similar to the test on this site (which is on legibility of web fonts)
on type size.

People who only read cheap paperback novels don&rsquo;t have any trouble with eight-point type. Those with bad vision have no trouble with 14+ point type because its all they ever see. Many of my friends are lawyers, and they whinge about reading anything that isn&rsquo;t set in 12 point Times New Roman with with double-spaced lines and extra spaces after periods.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about studies or rules for type size. Worry about what your audience is expecting and how you can use their expectations to manipulate them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re not the first to ask for the results of &ldquo;readability&rdquo; tests to satisfy a client (or oneself). it must be one of the most-asked questions on Typophile.  Why do typographers and their clients need to be reassured by some banal tests made by scientists who have no feeling for typography that they know what they&rsquo;re doing? We all know the tests are meaningless (note Alessandro&rsquo;s sample). Whose eyes are we pulling the wool over? The more this goes on, the more we dig our own grave. If we let our clients (or ourselves) buy into this bullshit that the the quality of typography can be measured, they won&rsquo;t need typographers, but will get everything set in Arial or Comic Sans (whatever is &ldquo;proved&rdquo; most legible) in the &ldquo;optimum&rdquo; setting. Why do we need authorities to justify our decisions? Isn&rsquo;t the designer the authority? What is the point of developing a refined sensibility if no-one trusts it? If that&rsquo;s the case, the typographer is a low-grade technician who can soon be replaced by a piece of software.</p>
<p>However, why not prepare a few variants, and test them on a suitable focus group? That&rsquo;s much better than relying on vague generalization.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Jasper, I don&rsquo;t think that all tests are bad or that advancing our knowlege of type through science is a bad idea; but as far as I have seen ( which not far enough I will admit ) there is a massive massive gap between what has been done with testing so far &amp; what type designers ( or type users ) can actualy find broadly useful. My take on what Nick said is not &lsquo;screw science&rsquo; - it&rsquo;s that there is no point in waiting around with our hands in our pockets for science to catch up and guide us.  As he said <cite>' What is the point of developing a refined sensibility if no-one trusts it? &lsquo;</cite>. He is bang on there. Plenty of type designer do know what they are doing. And how do they do that great work? A: They use that sensibility that Nick mentioned. When you can point to a well desined and typographically sensible test or two, by all means let us know! But don&rsquo;t expect us to hold our breath in the meantime.</div>

One designer may choose to use 9/10 Garamond while another uses 10/12. If the goal is to make it as quick as possible for readers to read this information, can both designs be equally optimal?</p>
<p>Reading tests shouldn’t be banal or used to justify anyone’s decisions, but rather to learn more about how people read. This knowledge can be used to improve designs. Test do not replace the role of the designer in any way. Testing can only be used to study existing reading conditions, but improving the experience beyond what already exists takes creativity. All design involves creative problem solving which cannot be automated.</p>
<p>Miles Tinker ran many studies investigating optimal type sizes. For most typefaces he found that reading speed peaked at 11 point and was slower when you used smaller or larger text. For some fonts (I believe those with larger x-heights) reading speed peaked at 10 point. See Tinker’s book Legibility of Print for more details.</p>
<p>This assumes a reader with normal visual abilities. With some vision impairments, it is not possible to read 8-12 point text sizes and larger text is required. While reading is impossible without a much larger size, it does accompany a loss in reading speed. Optimal text size is a natural consequence of the density of photoreceptors in the fovea (part of the retina used for reading).</p>
<p>Cheers, Kevin</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kevin,
Tinkers studies are not very recent.  The nature of both printing, type design, have gone through several changes since then.  What readers today have gotten accustomed to reading has also changed.  There is a lot more smaller type being read than their used to be. I don&rsquo;t pretend to know if any of this changes Tinker&rsquo;s conclusions for today&rsquo;s reader but I sure would like someone to test it.
On another readability issue, much has been made of eye movements as a measure of good readability but I have a problem in the translation from percent of difference of eye movement to percent of enhanced or decreased readability. I have yet to see a comparative measure which gives me a usable comparison in reading speed and reading comprehension. An example might be using today&rsquo;s Garamond Premier Pro at 9 point vs. 10 point with the same characters per line and same proportion of leading, how much faster in pages per hour and how much more comprehension (however you can really measure that) am I gaining or losing by changing the point size one point?
This will tell me something to help make design decisions.  If the difference is so small that it is inconsequential in a given reading situation then why not opt for the more efficient use of space?  Readability is always paired with efficiency in the decision making process.  The readability that interests me is when it affects the exact situation it is being used in, not just a more generalized &ldquo;bigger is better&rdquo; or &ldquo;serif is better&rdquo; thinking which gets seized upon rather than what the actual studies conclusion intended.</p>

<p>That agrees with my intuitive feeling, if we take an average ascender to be 1.6 bigger than the x height, and the type to fill 95% + of the body size.</p>
<p>Kevin, I think that you could refine these numbers if you would use my suggested measure of reading comfort: rate of decrease in comprehension with time :).  You could also measure boldness (% of black to white), presence of serifs and amount of leading&ndash;all of which I think will have a measureable influence. And letter spacing and measure. Those are 6 variables, and though a lot would tell us most of what we need to know.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I do think that below 11 point Adobe Garamond Pro is less readable, as it has a small x-height. However, it will probably require less leading at 11 or 12 point, so it may end up being economical enough for you.</p>

Opinion of What? Study of what? In my opinion, if you have both pertaining to your problem, it&rsquo;s best, (especially if they agree:). But if you have to choose between typographic practice, and a study of something else, other than what you need a study of, well, I&rsquo;d go with the practice. And on the other hand, if I had a study of what I was looking for, and typographic practice of something else, well, then, I&rsquo;d go read the study carefully to make sure, because one bad move in a study can muddy the results beyond belief, so to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anyone know of any studies [of] legibility that show&hellip;Body copy larger than 9, 10, 11 pt [] are actually harder to read? (I prefer reading text that is between 8-10 pt)&rdquo;
We did a preference study at the Poynter Institute more than 10 years ago that showed readers preferred type set in newspapers that was designed for setting between 8.5 and 11 pt., and set at those sizes, not smaller or larger. Not all of the types we tested were designed for such use, and those did not win, but they did better than expected. All of the subjects were expecting &ldquo;newspaper text&rdquo;, (the paper being a dead giveaway), and they were all adults, so it wasn&rsquo;t a test of ALL LEGIBILITY, or even all fonts, or all users.</p>
<p>But the results allowed us to see how to draw some very readable faces, for print, that if sales are any indication, which I&rsquo;m sure they are not, are very readable, i.e. beyond legible perhaps. We are planning now to do the same thing for screen types, building a test-bed of fonts, and sending them home with users to try out. I&rsquo;m arguing for both obtrusive and non-obtrusive recording of the choices, but we&rsquo;ll see. It&rsquo;s all very expensive, and you need to get it right from initial input to the final adjustments of claims. Just like typeface design, if everything isn&rsquo;t right, it useless.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As one with a little experience in book design for the New Zealand market, I feel compelled to say that the designer&rsquo;s &lsquo;authority&rsquo; is (unfortunately) a moot point in this context.</p>
<p>Your editors, Jasper, are telling you to use the 12 pt Garamond because they&rsquo;ve previously had a good experience with that particular spec. and they&rsquo;re just going with what they know. If you try and railroad them into accepting your preference - with or without some other authority - it&rsquo;s likely to be counterproductive.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t mention the other attributes of the spec. but notice how everyone else does; without the associated values that make up the rest of the appearance of the text block, arguing about 12pt or not is a little abstract.</p>
<p>I can suggest three possible approaches;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Offer them options; do a truckload of comparison settings (whole pages) with variations of line length (set width), leading and tracking. Dig out the rule-of-thumb reminders about optimum line length and leading values. Be prepared to make minute variations and annotate everything so you know at a glance what the variables are. Don&rsquo;t forget to consider paragraph indentation and/or spacing and how many lines you&rsquo;ll achieve for each page. Sit down with the editors and discuss the results as openly as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do a word count and work out the average page yield. Calculate the overall extent of the book at 12pt. Do the same calculation based on your preference for the smaller type size; then try doing it again for an interim value between the two. Try and figure out if it makes a difference in terms of the print production costs associated with the book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research other titles on Napier, preferably by competitor publishing houses here in NZ. Are they using 12pt Garamond too? Try and find examples of whatever won last years NZ book awards. What will be this title&rsquo;s point of difference from all the other books?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck with it.</p>

<p>Tinker’s legibility research program was huge, carried out over 4 decades (1920s through the 1950s) on many thousands of readers. It would be great if someone would undertake the project to retest his most famous findings to see if anything has changed since Tinker’s time. My guess is that the text size finding hasn’t changed because it’s a result of photoreceptor density, not personal experience. In one of the Tinker &amp; Patterson books they reports on a survey of typographic variables like point size and leading used in different kinds of publications (novels, newspapers, textbooks, etc.). I was surprised at how common it was to see text sizes as small as 6 point.</p>

<p>Eye tracking measures are similar to reading speed measures, but provide additional detail such as the amount of time spent fixating on each word and the frequency of regressive saccades. Most studies look for a difference either in reading speed or comprehension. When measuring reading speed, the material used is simple enough that readers will understand it with full comprehension and comprehension questions are used to confirm this. Else more difficult material is used and the amount of time spent reading is controlled (e.g. you are given 5 minutes to read an article). This style of reading test is frequently used in U.S. college admission tests. Combinations of reading speed and comprehension are rarely used because they the scores need to be combined, and debated if it better to read an article in 4 minutes with 80% comprehension or 5 minutes with 90% accuracy?</p>

<p>I’m not necessarily surprised that people said they preferred smaller text sizes for newspapers. It wouldn’t be unreasonable at all for people to desire a smaller text size than the one that allows for fast reading. Many people read newspapers by only reading the front page of each section. By asking for smaller text sizes, the readers asking for more information on that first page. I don’t see this as being in conflict with the reading speed data.</p>

<p>Kevin, you&rsquo;re mistaking the user&rsquo;s degree of satisfaction with a professional service for actual professional expertise in providing satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>Optimal text size is a natural consequence of the density of photoreceptors in the fovea</em></p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t even make sense. There is no such thing as optimal text size, because there is no way to measure text size. It is quite simply not a scientific concept. The best that can be determined is that easy-reading text should be between 8 and 12 pt size, which is so vague and useless a statement as to be a self-evident platitude, like saying gloves should not be too tight or too loose.</p>
<p>It is not physiology which best determines the text size for a particular setting, but a typographic understanding of the many variables involved in reading it, such as the reader demographic, the paper stock, the publishing genre (which affects the reading environment), the document page size, language, author, paragraph length, and of course the many typographic variables other than size, such as typeface, leading, measure (line length), tracking, alignment style, gutter and margin width.</p>

<p>Nick, your analogy is not sound. Kevin reports that &ldquo;reading speed&rdquo; peaked at 11 point. This is not a subjective self-report of satisfaction, but an objective measure. In science, the results of objective tests are the authority. They trump scientists' opinions and your opinion and mine.</p>
<p>A closer analogy would be to Doctors' opinions of the effectiveness of a procedure and the results of objective and extensive double-blind tests of the actual impact on patients. The results are more authoritative than the opinions. Of course there can be bias, poor methodology, and cheating in the tests. But these can be checked  for by repeating experiments.</p>

<p>What scientific research actually shows and what is claimed in the name of science are often very far apart, particularly in the fields of medicine and health.</p>

<p>By all means, new tests. However, in order to justify new experiments, I am sure that Kevin or another researcher would want to have a strong reason to expect different results. What is different about modern and type and conditions that would lead us to expect a different result? Or what was defective in the methodology of the earlier research?</p>
<p>As I wrote, a new measure&ndash;comfort in reading, as measured by decrease in comprehension with time&ndash;might reveal a lot of information that reading speed alone doesn&rsquo;t tell us. So I would like the 6 variables I mentioned tested this way, as well as type size&ndash;or preferably, x height size.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree completely with William’s comments about objective measures. Repeatable objective measures are more interesting that individual opinion. As Chris points out, it was once people’s subjective opinion that that the world was flat. But it’s difficult to rectify this theory with objective data that the sun rises earlier and falls earlier in New York than Los Angeles. I don’t think there is any objective data that supports that flat world theory.</p>
<p>I think there are other possibilities for measuring the reading experience, including William’s proposal and a measure that I proposed at ATypI Helsinki (which will be published soon); but I would claim that reading speed is the primary measure of legibility. If I’m given the choice between reading an article with two typographic treatments and told that I’ll read one version 5% faster without a loss in comprehension, I’m going to choose that version.</p>

<p>Of course not now.  What was thought to be objective data centuries ago was that sometimes ships went out to sea and never returned.  The falacious but nevertheless agreed upon wisdom of that time was that they fell off the edge of the Earth. My point was that what we may now think of as objective data may at some point in the future be thought of as wrong.  This will never occur if we don&rsquo;t question past measurements or view things from &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo;.  I am just saying don&rsquo;t lock up our minds with absolutes so much that we never look for things we were unable to see before.  Is Pluto a planet now? Was it thought to be a planet last year? Did the astronomers quit doing science because they had &ldquo;objective data&rdquo; that pluto was a planet? No, they kept looking.  Let&rsquo;s keep looking too.</p>
<p>Kevin: Where does the &ldquo;5% faster&rdquo; figure come from or are you just pulling a number out of the air for sake of argument?</p>

<p>Well, if they want to discredit my expertise as &ldquo;personal opinion&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll have to do a more convincing job of it. Let&rsquo;s see those &ldquo;repeatable objective measures&rdquo; in action! However, I suspect that the description of the experiment would have to be so typographically precise, in order to get the same results, that generalization would be impossible. If Scientist A uses Adobe Garamond and Scientist B uses ITC Garamond&hellip;</p>
<p><em>As Chris points out, it was once people’s subjective opinion that that the world was flat.</em></p>
<p>And it is still people&rsquo;s subjective experience that the sun rises and sets. If you imagine the earth spinning, it makes for dizzyness.</p>

<p>“reading speed” peaked at 11 point. This is not a subjective self-report of satisfaction, but an objective measure.&quot;
But it is an objective measure only of 11 point plus, a long string of other defined variables from illumintation to type style.

I think, that it&rsquo;s only a truely objective measure when you know exactly what will make 10.5 win, or 11 lose.

<p>Bakers don&rsquo;t need scientist to tell them how to make bread. Of course Science can be used to find out lots of interesting things about bread. But before a scientist studies bread they should get to know bread from the Bakers point of view. As far as I understand it that &lsquo;getting to know&rsquo; the subject hasn&rsquo;t happened with type studies - yet. The tests have been too naive. MUCH too naive. That could change and I would like it to change. But until it does there is is no point in waiving &lsquo;science&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;tests&rsquo; around to impress us. A little more meekness would go a long way. Nick&rsquo;s examples of variables to think about are excellent. No doubt there are even more to consider.</p>
<p>In the end it never going to be a good idea to ask &lsquo;tests&rsquo; what bread you should eat or what type you should use. Rather, it&rsquo;s always going to be a good idea to feel your way into it, thinking about the situation as whole, and experiemening for yourself, and when you can; allowing your decision to be informed by whatever science can offer at the time. These choices are always going be partly a cultural excercise too. The pure consideration of efficiency and or effectiveness will never be a complete guide to practice.</p>
<p>I think that people who are beating down these proclimations of &lsquo;fact&rsquo; are not against science at all. I think they were interested and then disappointed by what they found. Maybe I am just gerealizing my own case.</p>
<p>Ceratinly there are always people who rather than working at looking &amp; seeing better ( for themselves ) would like to rely on someone else&rsquo;s rules to justify what their choices. Designers and Clients. But that&rsquo;s just hiding from reality. It&rsquo;s weak. No matter what science may get around to showing in time it&rsquo;s always going to be a good idea to keep your eyes open &amp; mind open. That&rsquo;s just good science.</p>
<p>I am not going to to go so far as to say I&rsquo;m right about any of this. But this how it looks to me today.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Agreed. But as you point out, science is being quite extensively by cooks. Many cooking magazines, led by Cook’s Illustrated, regularly use the scientific method to improve their recipes. They do not test if brioche the best bread, but rather attempt to optimize the preparation of a certain recipe. They regularly make 20 different versions of a recipe, manipulating one variable at a time, in their search for the best preparation. They ask several people to taste each version of the recipe and rate how good a recipe tastes. Testing is being used here as a useful tool to help the chef.</p>
<p>At a different level, Harold McGee has written several interesting books explaining how different cooking techniques impact foods at the molecular level. Our understanding of the effects of cooking preparations on food is better than our understanding of legibility (though certainly not perfect). This information is useful for understanding the health impact of different foods and preparations. If a chef is interested in making healthful food, it would be useful to pay attention to this kind of information. Similarly, if we understood the mental processes for recognizing words, this information could be used to make more legible typefaces. Of course if a type designers purpose had nothing to do with legibility, this information could be safely ignored.</p>
<p>There has been a misunderstanding about science in this thread. Science is not a topic, but a method for learning. Not all statements are scientific just because they are about topics closely associated with science like chemistry, physics, or the natural world. Science is defined by the scientific method, a process for making observations about the world and conducting experiments to test the accuracy of proposed theories. Claiming that ships could go missing because they fell off the edge of the world is not a scientific statement, but a post-hoc explanation of an event. A repeatable scientific experiment that could support the flat earth theory would be to demonstrate that the sun rises and falls at the same time in Seattle and Los Angeles. The best theory is the one that supports the most evidence.</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Methodology and Definitions</li>
<li>Legibility of Letters and Digits</li>
<li>Kinds of Type</li>
<li>Size of Type</li>
<li>Width of Line</li>

<li>Printing Surfaces</li>
<li>Cumulative Effect of Combining Nonoptimal Typographical Arrangements</li>
<li>Newspaper Typography</li>
<li>Formulas and Mathematical Tables</li>
<li>Special Printing Situations</li>
<li>Illumination for Reading</li>
<li>The Hygienic Reading Situation</li>
</ol>
<p>I am quite impressed by the breadth of topics that Tinker studied, and am surprised that many typographers are not familiar with his work. It has been mentioned in this thread that some researchers understand little about typography. This does not apply to Tinker. He spent his entire  career studying typography and working with printers.</p>
<p>In this book you can find studies of size effects on different type faces in Chapter 5, studies looking at the interaction of leading line length and size in Chapter 7, studies of size in the context of Newspapers in Chapter 12, and the interaction of size and illumination in Chapter 15.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is the popular perception of ease of reading and the plebeian monolinear logic that bigger is better; there are the confirmed realities of reading speed, eye movements, user satisfaction, sustainability of immersion&ndash;with comprehension and engagement&ndash;varying with font selection, type size, leading and line length, illumination, paper stock or type of screen; and there is the accumulated craft-wisdom of the typographical clerisy that optimization of readability is a multi-dimensional exercise, and the generation of an gestural atmospheric <em>plus value</em> a benefit.</p>
<p>Kevin, my impression is that in the end Tinker and Patterson&rsquo;s cumulative results confirm the typographical intuition that the optimization of readability is a multi-dimensional exercise and that their results are probably mis-applied when recruited to support a monoliniar logic (of bigger is better for instance) or binary choices (between serif and sans serif for instance) or an intrinsic antagonism between functionality and aesthetics.</p>
<p>Efficiency of eye movements and sustainability of immersion with comprehension might be better indicies of readability in typographic terms than reading speed. No one typographical factor controls this.</p>
<p>I suspect there is an optimal <em>range</em> of reading speed where sense following is robust. Too slow, and effective sense-following is jeopordized; too fast, and sense-following deteriorates. All good type has to do is work within this range. Higher reading speeds does not mean more legible or readable, all it means is more functional in circumstances where speed of recognition is of the essence, like in highway signage. Type faces aren&rsquo;t readable. Text is. <em>Writing</em> can be legible or illegible. It&rsquo;s not the brute or base-level legibility of a typeface that we should be talking about, because it is rarely in question in fonts designed for extended text use. We do need to talk about the discrimination affordance of words and letters in type X under conditions Y and Z (speed, size, illumination), or the ability of a font to stand up under degradation because of screen or printing conditions.</p>

<p>To be impertinent: I agree with Nick. Referring to uni-varient tests of reading speed as &lsquo;legibility research&rsquo; is an insidious misnomer.</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to know how typographical factors interact under variable conditions of use relative to other scales than reading speed. 2) We need to inform ourselves about what&rsquo;s important and why, rather than what to do and by how much. We need empirico-scientifically grounded frameworks for intelligent action rather than direct prescriptions for immobile specifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are tests of reading speed useless? no!!</p>

<p>Absolutely, Chapter 11 of Legibility of Print looks at some of the combinatorial effects of the factors they studied. It’s a bit of an oversimplification, but I think they found that reading speed is reduced if any of the typographical variables they studied were set very differently from what was found optimal in the single variable studies.</p>
<p>When you reference bigger is better, I don’t think you mean that someone said that larger text sizes are always better (though that might be somewhat true for visual impairment)? Instead I think you’re asking if it’s always better to have faster reading speeds? I would argue that as long as comprehension is kept constant, that faster reading speeds are always better. I would guess that more than half of the time spent reading is not spent on word recognition, but spent trying understand the meaning behind the string of words. I would also assume that improved legibility makes it easier to recognize words, but has little effect processing the meaning of a sentence. I see no reason to not try to improve the efficiency of word recognition as much as possible. If content is difficult, reading speed will slow to allow more time to process the meaning of the sentence and shouldn’t ever need slower word recognition speeds to help it out. (Peter, you may be interested in Fodor’s argument of modularity in Modularity of Mind)</p>

<p>I think reading speed is an approximation of efficient eye movements. Fast reading speed means some combination of reduced fixation time, reduced regressive saccades, and longer saccades. Reading speed does not get at sustainability of immersion. Understanding what immersion means and how to measure it is an interesting area of research. I would humbly point to my article in Typo for one idea on that topic.</p>
