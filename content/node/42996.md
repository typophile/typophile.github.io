  client with H&FJ's lovely new Archer. However, before committing her cash, she (and
  I for that matter) would like to see a printed sample. Do any of you know where
  in London I might be able to pick up a copy of \"Martha Stewart Living\", which
  uses Archer extensively? I will also see if H&FJ can do a brief mock-up PDF.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help,\r\n\r\nDominic"

    I'd say the best thing to do is contact H&FJ directly about this. Note that their
    fonts are non-transferrable so you'll need to license the fonts with your clients'
    name and address.

  body: Thank you Miss Tiffany. In fact, I tracked down a copy in Waterstone's Piccadilly,
    the largest book shop (so they claim) in Europe. I've sent a short file to H&FJ
    to ask if they'd PDF it but so far no response. Perhaps this is an atypical request?

    Not H&FJ I guess.

  body: 'H&FJ advertise in many major design magazines, including ID, Print, STEP,
    etc. Not sure what UK mags they would advertise in. Their advertisements tend
    to show the featured design in a lot of different settings (mostly low-contrast,
    soft colors), and fill a whole magazine page. Recently ads have appeared featuring
    Archer exclusively. This might be enough information for your client. '

  body: Thanks everyone for your suggestions. In the event, a look at "Martha Stewart
    Living" has given me and the client enough to go on, and I will be purchasing
    the basic package, which, at current rates of exchange, seems a very good buy.
