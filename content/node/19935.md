  engaged in human-type activities such as dancing, playing the piano, driving a car,
  etc. This was sold maybe 6 years ago or more. I thought it was sold through T-26
  but I contacted someone there who doesn't know anything about it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  remembers this or has some lead on where to find it I'd appreciate any help.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"
