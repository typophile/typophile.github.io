body: "In this week, I bought the two DVDs \"Bleisatzschriften\" (= \"Foundry Types\"),
  which contain innumerable old foundry type catalogs and several old typeface books,
  and also catalogs of hot-metal machine composition typefaces, all of them scanned
  and converted to PDF files.\r\n\r\nFor typeface historians, these two DVDs are a
  must.\r\nHere are some random samples drawn from both DVDs: \r\n\r\n- http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/Sample1.jpg\r\n-

    go away, I can't help but wonder after the lost sensation of holding the type
    specimen books, turning the pages, and experiencing light reflecting off of paper
    and ink.\r\n\r\nAllow me to encourage everyone to scour tag and estate sales for
    old books.  Keep them, look at them.  Maybe even read them (I assume typophiles
    do this but you never know.)\r\n\r\nLast week I had the great good fortune to
    chat with the director of library and archival studies at LSU.  Digitizing is
    super important but we need to remind everyone to also keep the books.  (Ah, the
    books.)\r\n\r\nRead:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/3562724/Hamlets-Blackberry-Why-Paper-Is-Eternal\r\n\r\nand
    thank you for the post."

  body: I sent for both of these, and they are wonderful! Not quite as nice as physical
    books, but they do take up a lot less space. I find it most convenient to peruse
    them with QuickView on my Mac.

  body: "You know the way that digital paper works?\r\nWell, what if the pixels were
    at the end of tiny pistons--so that a scan could record the depth of impression
    of metal type, and that could be displayed in the reading device? \r\nOther dimensional
    3D technologies yet to represent letterpress--lenticular, holographic, &c.\r\n\r\nThe
    original documents are priceless, because every copy is ultimately poor.\r\nRemember
    microfiche.\r\n\r\nSomething about the scent of old books too, and their fragility
    in one's hands."

  body: "Nick, you and Nancy are right about the original books. But finding specimen
    books is becoming increasingly hard as they\u2019ve become quite popular with
    book collectors. Prices for anything but the basic ATF/Linotype/Bauer books are
    shooting up, and they sell quickly, making them hard to find at all. Scans are
    a great place to start. They can also be a nice resource for finding out what
    was on the pages that were cut out for comping!"
