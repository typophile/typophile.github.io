    (Taschen, perhaps?) published a gorgeous two-volume set of specimen book samples
    from the mid-1800s through the 1960s, with much WOW! stuff in the set\u2026"

    of Victorian era Letterpress Specimens other than Jan Tholenaar?\" would you list
    some sources?\r\n\r\nI wonder if there isn't some library somewhere in Europe
    that has like every type specimen ever made or something...?"

    but the quality of reproductions is poor.\r\n\r\nNineteenth Century Ornamented
    Types and Title pages (Faber & Faber 1938, 1951, 1976), By Nicolette Gray:\r\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/19th-Nineteenth-Century-Ornamented-Types-Nicolette-Gray-Victorian-typefaces-font-/110972571664?pt=Antiquarian_Books_UK&hash=item19d67b1010\r\nSure
    it\u2019s expensive, but one thing you\u2019re paying for is the fact that the
    reproductions are made from line blocks, size as.\r\n\r\nGoogle book:\r\nhttp://www.galleyrack.com/images/artifice/letters/press/noncomptype/typography/fry/fry-1816-google-bodleian--specimen-of-printing-types.pdf\r\nThis
    really demonstrates the problem with reproductions, there is nowhere near enough
    resolution, never mind the \uFB02atness of the image.\r\n\r\nI think you would
    be better to go to a rare-book library, they are likely to have a type specimen
    section."

    of Maryland in College Park houses the Maurice Annenberg collection of type specimen
    catalogs, which is quite extensive. The New York Public Library is supposed to
    have a large collection of specimen books, also, but I haven\u2019t seen it."
