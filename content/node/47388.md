  same size.\r\nMiddle: lower case and small cap accents are the same size, cap accent
  slightly bigger.\r\nBottom: accents progressively sized.\r\n\r\nIn many faces (but
  not all), I vary the angle of the acute, grave and circumflex/caron accents between
  cap, small cap and lower case.\r\nHowever, I always make the tilde, ring, dieresis
  etc. the same size--through laziness as much as anything else, I guess.\r\nHowever
  it ocurred to me while making the \"N small cap with tilde\" accent here that perhaps
  these accents should be sized according to case. (Actually, I have had this thought
  before, concerning the \"attached accents\", ogonek and cedilla.)\r\nI wonder if
  there are any types where this has been done?\r\nIs it a good idea?"

  body: 'Nick, I agree with Chris on this one. It can be a good idea, but it depends
    on your design. In your case I would opt for version #2 but with the capital accent
    scaled but a little less heavy. Your post is good food for thought and set me
    to think about my own small caps accents also. In my case I guess I''ll have to
    try something that lies in between U&lc.'

  body: "\"Is it a good idea?\"\r\nThe bigger the gap between the heights and weights
    of the l.c. and u.c., the more likely the need for case sensitive accents. Text
    vs. display also plays a part, as does of course, design energy. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    to do accents on raised characters as well (I think someone mentioned in another
    thread that French at least needs a raised \xE9 for some ordinal numbers maybe?).\r\n\r\nAlthough
    this font in particular I don't see having a full set of superscript and subscript
    (though I could be wrong).\r\n\r\nMore randomly, I just found a unique new capital
    \xD1 that looks like an inverted breve, something I (seriously) hadn't seen before
    untiL I saw it yesterday, so you could just go with a totally new shape for the
    cap and a smaller version for the small cap and then the normal version for the
    lowercase ;-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oddtilde_5203.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    all seriousness, I'd go with whatever feels best.  In this example the second

    small caps, yes. I'm afraid I haven't tracked it carefully enough to know for
    sure which of our typefaces (if any) do this, besides my own Hypatia Sans. I believe
    it would mostly be more recent Slimbach designs.\r\n\r\nBTW, like Jos, we don't
    only do scaling. In many cases the cap accent is wider but flatter (proportionally
    speaking) than the lower case accent.\r\n\r\nI wasn't counting ordinals or superiors.
    We have recently started doing e with grave in that size. But that's pretty obviously
    going to get a different size accent!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "AGL: While I've definitely seen mistakes like that, this is consistent in
    the entire book (every capital \xD1 uses this mark), but I find it essentially
    impossible to believe that the typesetter didn't have tildes available, it's a
    wholly requisite character for Spanish printing and would be like not having a
    Z.  For reference, the book was printed in 1722 in Madrid, which, granted, is
    out of my general time period of study.  I'm going to try to look up some other
    examples to see if this was a particular quirk of either the printer or the period,
    but most of the time a mistake with the tilde is to accidentally print it in reverse
    like I've seen a few times from Iuan de la Cuesta's presses (which I've seen in
    New Mexico's highway signage too!)\r\n\r\nThat said, it doesn't look too odd to
    me since at that time, italic tildes actually were far more like breves (in almost
    all instances I've ever seen prior to about early 1800s).  In fact, on a Spanish
    passport, on the inside front cover, this traditional and almost extinct form
    is still used (unfortunately I didn't take a picture of it when I had the chance)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tilde_breve_5489.png]\r\n\r\nIt
    warrants investigation whenever I can get some free time to do it.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    typographer used that sign as a tilde.\r\nI suppose the typographer while examining
    the manuscript realized that he did not have enough tildes to compose four pages
    (a possible spread back then), and so he decided to use something else, even parenthesis,
    and keep the style over the whole book. Is possible, I am just speculating.\r\nA
    curiosity: I learned from a old time typographer in Seville that, due to the use
    of german, english or american mats on linotype or monotype composing machines
    without accents, it become sort of a 'rule' not accent capital letters (accute
    accents) except the \"N\" , which you know is not a accented character. Cheers.\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\n\r\n\"
