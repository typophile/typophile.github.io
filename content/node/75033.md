  How to change an existing corner point to a curve point. The manual says:\r\n\r\n<cite>Note:
  A quick way to change the connection type is to double-click on a\r\nnode.</cite>
  [page 345 in the PDF version]\r\n\r\nNot on my machine(s). Windows, both XP and
  Vista.\r\n\r\nExample: Suppose I add a point on what is now a straight line. It
  will be a corner point, w/o handles. How do I change it to a curve point, with handles?"

    PC I assume some similar procedure exists, though I don't know which modifier
    key is used when dragging.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: Alt/click on the line segment and the handles will appear. Do this to both
    segments and then double click on the node to change it from a corner to a smooth
    (curve) node.
