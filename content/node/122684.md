body: "Hello.\r\n \r\nI'm fairly experienced in Illustrator, but there's a technique
  that I can't seam to figure out.\r\n \r\nHere the designers used some circles as
  guides. Very sharp and snapping the guide.\r\n\r\n<img>https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/368240/screenshots/1784157/bravura-bratus_1x.jpg</img>\r\n
  \r\nMy Problem:\r\nI know how to make an object into a guide, but how do I get my
  objects curves to be as clean as the guides. I can do it by eye, but it's never
  exactly on point.\r\n \r\nDoes this technique have a name I can google or can somebody
  send me some tutorials.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThank you.\r\n1 Se Tags (rediger): logoIndhold

    to make smooth curves.

  body: I don't know if there is a "better" way to do this, but I would just make
    circles and use the pathfinder tools to subtract the intersects, etc.
