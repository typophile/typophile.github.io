  I came up with a concept that basically uses the letters of the comapny name to
  build the shape of a womans torso [unfortunately my non-disclosure doesn't allow
  me to post it here] The original rough nearly satisfied my creative and technical
  goals for the projects. The clients loved it, but after several revisions the clients
  still aren't quite satisfied and continue to ask for changes that I believe stray
  from good design.\r\nAny advice on steering them back to the side of sound design?\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much,\r\ncd"

    that you will encounter all too often. If your artistic integrity is more important
    than paying the rent, you can simply tell your clients that their ideas are total
    crap, thank them very much, and walk out the door. If, on the other hand, you've
    put a lot of effort into the project and feel that you ought to be compensated
    for it, you have to give the people who sign the checks what they want, even if
    you do, in fact, think it's total crap.\r\n\r\nIn the former instance, you write
    off your losses and preserve your self-respect; in the latter instance, you collect
    your fee and leave that particular project out of your portfolio. Bummer..."

    be proud of. I suppose other designers will be able to see the concept through

    the rejected design in your portfolio -- that is, the one YOU believe is well-done.

  body: "we stipulate in our contracts that the client gets 3 rounds of changes. After
    that, they are on the clock. Makes compromise a lot less painful when you know
    that for every time you lower your standard, you ring the cash register. Of course
    there's always a chance you'll end up with something you're happy with after all
    those rounds. In that case, the extra $$ is the icing on the cake. Not to sound
    crass, but we put the brakes on unlimited changes years ago - after rounds and
    rounds of seemingly endless revisions. The idea of 'what is finished' could be
    a dissertation in itself. \r\n\r\nIn terms of whether or not you can put it in
    your portfolio - we keep 2 portfolios like criminals keep 2 sets of books. You
    get the idea."

  body: "\"Ahhh! Leave it out of the portfolio. pretend it never happened.\"\r\n\r\nWhile
    one should always be proud of their work regardless of the profession, one also
    has to be a bit pragmatic at times. It is a service industry after all.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have the status and clout as a fine French Chef, you can kick out that customer
    that insists on asking for Ketchup to go with their steak. Most places, however,
    will gladly hand the ketchup to the customer and drop of the bill when they're
    finished.\r\n\r\nSo, if you hit the point where the client just has to have their
    way, finish it for them, get paid, and then put the version of the logo YOU liked
    in your portfolio. ;o)\r\n\r\nRemy also has sound advice...never leave the 'revision'
    stage open ended. "

  body: "I have certain \"rules\" too, like Remy I usually put up to 3 revisions in
    the contract, after that I bill hourly. But I can be flexible depending on the
    job - if it's something I'm proud of and want to be associated with  I'll be more
    generous with my time and effort. But I'll also be quite clear with the client
    if I feel it's not moving in a good direction. And I have walked away from jobs
    where I have felt that either it's being designed by committee (and the result
    is not good) or the client and I are not on the same page creatively and are not
    likely to agree on a solution. Or if the client just can't articulate what he/she
    wants and I feel like we're both spinning our wheels.\r\n\r\nNot everything I
    do ends up in my portfolio, but if it isn't going to be a portfolio piece I better
    have gotten well compensated.\r\n\r\nI also look at the big picture - the easy,
    high-paying jobs help subsidize the more laborious ones. I'm way underpaid on
    a job I'm doing right now but it's a real feather in my cap so I'm sucking up
    and putting in the extra hours (even cut my vacation short a day).\r\n\r\nI tend
    not to include work that wasn't used in my portfolio. I don't think unresolved
    jobs (which often require explanation) put your best foot forward. Ditto with
    spec work. But that's just my opinion. As an art director, I was always interested
    in the portfolio pieces that were successful both from a design and a client point
    of view. Unless you're a student of course."

  body: Well, my take on graphic design might be a little different. I happen to think
    that the logo you're working on can not be a success if the client isn't happy
    with it. Who are you working for? Yourself? Or are you trying to give a voice
    to the client's vision?

    solution, it's best when everybody is happy. I'm having a similar issue right
    now - I know I'm giving my client good design options but for them nothing really
    \"sings\" and besides that there are three people I need to please, who don't
    necessarily agree with each other. I have to find a solution this weekend that
    will \"sing\" for all three or else they have to move on and try someone else,
    which has rarely happened to me before. If that transpires, I will get paid for
    the work I put in, but I'm hoping to pull something out of my hat that will let
    me keep the job.\r\n\r\nI happen to agree with Chuck's comment \"the logo you\u2019re
    working on can not be a success if the client isn\u2019t happy with it.\" which
    is why I never include uncompleted jobs in my portfolio."
