body: Using FontLab, would it be better to build horizontal instructions inward from
  the left and right sidebearings towards the middle of the glyph, or starting from
  the left sidebearing, build all the instructions from left ot right? Or would starting
  with a double link on the main stems without touching the sidebearing be preferred?

  body: Depends somewhat on the usage of the font and what rasterizers you care about.
    But the big question is, do you need to preserve the spacing at low ppems, or
    are you willing to have the spacing get looser to maintain legibility? <BR> <BR>Most
    folks doing manual hinting are willing and able to distort the spacing at low
    ppems, which allows for the possibility of either using left-to-right hinting
    across the glyph, or using intermediate deltas that affect the right sidebearing
    to open up a glyph that is hinted outside-in. <BR> <BR>T

  body: I generally prefer to hint from left to right, as this makes it easier to
    preserve good lettershape. If you hint from the outside in, you have limited options
    for controlling the width of internal counters, which might get squished or extended
    at some sizes. You end up having to helta hint the whole character width at certain
    sizes, whereas if you hint from one side to the other you can specify a CVT white
    space value to control the counter as if it were a stem.

    with the sidebearings. <BR> <BR>T

  body: I have been using the left-to-right approach as well, but FontLabs default
    auto-hinting settings are for outside in and I was wondering if there is any advatage
    to this approach.  <BR> <BR>Thank you both for your comments.

    <BR>I&#39;m not sure I understand this comment, Thomas. It seems to me that you
    can control sidebearings in the same way, i.e. with a link, regardless of whether
    you hint inwards or right-to-left.
