    is a font released by Apple in 2003. It was released as part of Mac OS X v10.3[1]
    and the 10.2.8 update. It is regularly compared to Microsoft's Comic Sans font.
    Comic Sans has shipped with Mac OS since Mac OS 8.6 in 1999. Although much like
    the font Comic Sans, it is much less known and also less criticized.<blockquote>"
