  \r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-dynamoe/\r\n\r\nIt needs to be
  repeated on screen by an editor hundreds of times, so cant manualy draw the box
  behind it.\r\n\r\nBasically looking for a sans serif, similar to \r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hamburger/neutraliser-sans/\r\n\r\nI
  guess my other possibility would be to edit a font in Font Lab myself. Just wondering
  if anyone had undertaken something similar?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    setting reverse text.

  body: "Sometimes you will find fonts that have a \"cameo\" (reversed) weight...
    For example,\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aviation/fiendstar-cameo/\">Fiendstar
    Cameo</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/blitzplakat/\">Blitzplakat</a>\r\n\r\nHowever,
    be warned that searching for the term \"cameo\" on a font website will bring up
    fonts called Cameo as well as fonts with cameo (reversed) weights, and even some
    fonts with no reversed weight at all! So you will need a bit of patience...\r\n\r\nFor
    example, here is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=cameo&x=0&y=0\">a
    search for \"cameo\" on FontShop's site</a>.\r\n\r\nA <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=reversed&x=0&y=0\">search
    for the term \"reversed\" (on the same site)</a> also yielded some results.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this helps!\r\n"
