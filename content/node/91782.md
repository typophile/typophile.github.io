body: "Hi, all:\r\n\r\nI'm still looking for a typeface for this project. \r\n\r\nI
  love Palatino's readability in print when set at typical body-text sizes, and I
  find it beautiful and full of character set at display sizes. \r\n\r\nSimilarly,
  I really like Open Sans's screen readability for setting web body-text. Print and
  display, not so much.\r\n\r\nSo I'm looking for something Palatino-like that harmonizes
  well with Open Sans. Or, I'm looking for a superfamily with serif fonts that have
  some of the same DNA as Palatino and sans fonts that the layperson might not notice
  is any different than Open Sans.\r\n\r\nClosest I've come: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/orbi/
  \ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/orbi-sans/  I'm looking at some other typefaces
  by http://www.myfonts.com/person/Natalia_Vasilyeva/ to see if they look more Palatino-like
  to me. Orbi seems softer than Palatino; some aspect that I like about Palatino isn't
  there.\r\n\r\nI thought perhaps someone here would have some ideas without having
  to search too hard.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nAmado"

  body: "Thanks, hrant. I see what you mean. (I looked stuff up based on your post;
    learned stuff.)\r\n\r\nI'm not looking for \"a near-Palatino that's more suited
    to type.\" I'm more looking for a hybrid of sorts.\r\n\r\nI find no comments on
    this site about Open Sans (http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans).
    I find plenty about its designer, Steve Matteson. Be that as it may, Open Sans
    works really well at text sizes on the web, to my eye, for whatever reasons. I
    tried it in print at display sizes, and... just, \"no.\"\r\n\r\nSo I find myself
    asking, what if there was a sans face that works well in print for captions, headings,
    and at display sizes, one that Open Sans could somewhat \"pass for\" for the purposes
    of websites. What if that face were the sans part of a superfamily, and its serif
    counterparts were influenced by the same era that influenced Zapf's designs for
    Palatino/Aldus? (And if not a superfamily, at least a handsome pairing.)\r\n\r\nDoes
    such a creature exist?"

  body: "Thanks, Michael. I like Optima quite a bit.\r\n\r\nI don't think that's the
    direction I'm going, though. And someone just nudged me in this direction: they
    observed that Open Sans is Frutiger-esque. \r\n\r\n(There seem to be so many of
    them these days. I love the face! Except that I like a double-story /g/ (as well
    as /a/). Plus, many type designers are pushing the x-height quite large.)\r\n\r\nSo!
    Frutiger! Or: I also love Avenir! (Though Open Sans has more of a chance of being
    mistaken for Frutiger, I think.) Especially if I find out that they have the double-story
    /g/ available as an alternate glyph. Paired with... <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/breughel-lt/>Breughel</a>?

    would YOU do? (Monthly newsletter for local Jazz Society; various brochures and
    advertising; website.)"

  body: "No. Not the resolution. New resolution:\r\n\r\nLegacy (Serif and Sans).\r\n\r\nIt
    perhaps loses some of the Golden Type chunky charm, but it makes up for it --
    in spades -- in readability. And the sans, to my eye, does a lovely job of straddling
    Frutiger and Optima while harmonizing perfectly with the serif.\r\n\r\nPlus the
    wide variety of weights, plus I found Legacy Sans Condensed which looks awesome
    as a headline, and there's a \"square-serif\" in the family that looks like it
    has fun possibilities, perhaps for display use.\r\n\r\nThis feels like it has
    been a long time a-comin'. I hope it sticks this time!"
