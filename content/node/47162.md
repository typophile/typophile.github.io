body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nA while back I read an article in the New York Times Magazine about
  the design of a new typeface for highway signs (\u201CThe Road to Clarity,\u201D
  August 12, 2007). My area is engineering design, and the article inspired me to
  consider that typeface design might make a good educational example in \u201Ctransdisciplinary
  design.\u201D I\u2019m interested in your input about the designer\u2019s thought
  process in comparing several diverse concepts for a new typeface--either creating
  a new typeface or choosing from several alternatives. \r\n\r\nFrom reading this
  forum and investigating other educational resources, I can identify some major parameters
  that can be varied in the design of a typeface. For the sake of the discussion,
  let\u2019s consider serif typeface used for text in any of the various serif styles
  (inscriptional, Geralde, Transitional, Modern, etc.). \r\n\r\n1. Parameters \r\nThe
  parameters that can be changed would include x-height, color and stroke weight,
  spacing, stress angle, ascender and descender height, contrast, serif style, counter
  size, character width, etc. What else should this list include? \r\n\r\n2. Criteria\r\nIn
  designing a new typeface, what are the criteria or metrics that you use in evaluating
  different design concepts? \r\n\r\nThe criteria could be quantitative or qualitative.
  Quantitative criteria would include legibility, readability, efficiency, etc. Qualitative
  criteria would include balance, aesthetics, etc. What other criteria or metrics
  do you consider? And for the qualitative ones, how do you \u201Cmeasure\u201D or
  assess them? \r\n\r\n3. Conflict\r\nCan you think of aspects of type design in which
  there is potential \u201Cconflict\u201D between the design characteristics? For
  example, I saw in one post this statement: \u201CA good \u2018bad example\u2019
  is Mrs Eaves: x-height is ideal for large setting, color is ideal for midrange setting,
  and spacing is ideal for small setting: three-way mismatch.\u201D This is an example
  of the type of conflict that I\u2019m referring to in which the three parameters
  conflict with each other in fulfilling the three objectives for setting at different
  sizes. \r\n\r\n(In some theories of engineering design, a good design is defined
  as one in which a solution is found to such conflicts, or in others the \u201Clevel
  of inventiveness\u201D is characterized by the degree to which the conflict is resolved.)
  \r\n\r\n4. Theories\r\nWhat theories of legibility are you familiar with? Or what
  creative ideas have been put forth to adjust a typeface design to improve legibility?
  I\u2019ve seen descriptions of several approaches to improve legibility: large x-height,
  the M-formula of William Addison Dwiggins, Evert Bloemsma\u2019s emphasis of the
  tops of letterforms, the use of inktraps, and familiarity. What other novel theories
  have you seen to adjust letterforms to improve legibility? \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\ndt"

  body: "Linking to your 2 and 4, I would't say legibility or readability can be classed
    as quantitative criteria. I can perhaps see the possibility of user-testing or
    polling, returning some kind of quantitative data, but that'd be pseudo-scientific
    at best.\r\n\r\nI'd like to read more of those theories you mention. Do you have
    references to them? I'd love to hear other theories on quantifying legibility
    too."

  body: "Q2. Criteria for evaluation\r\n\r\nReading speed is the most obvious measure
    of reading performance. Miles Tinker is perhaps best associated with using this
    measure with a huge number of typographic variables over 40 years of research.
    http://www.amazon.com/Legibility-Print-Miles-Tinker/dp/0813824508\r\n\r\nThere
    are many other ways of measuring reading performance. Two that have been used
    in recent years for measuring typographic variables are time and distance threshold
    measures. A time threshold measure is measuring the minimal amount of time it
    takes to recognize text. Barbara Chaparro and her lab at Wichita State have done
    interesting work with this measure: http://www.surl.org/usabilitynews/92/legibility.asp\r\n\r\nThe
    distance threshold measure measures the smallest visual angle (farthest distance)
    needed to recognize text. The Clearview Highway work that you read about in the
    New York Times Magazine uses this, as does the work by James Sheedy\u2019s lab
    in discovering the letter superiority effect: http://hfes.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/hfes/hf/2005/00000047/00000004/art00009\r\n\r\nMeasuring
    the aesthetics of type is more challenging. Preference measures are the most typical
    measure (e.g. Rate how much you like this on a 1-7 scale; How much eye fatigue
    does this cause on a 1-7 scale, etc.). I\u2019ve been involved with work on trying
    to develop better measures. One idea was to measure cognitive performance after
    the reading experience since cognitive performance is known to be altered by the
    enjoyment of the experience. This work is described in Issue 22 of Typo Magazine
    http://www.magtypo.cz/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=105, but doesn\u2019t appear
    to be online. A short version appears in sidebar 1 of this article: http://spectrum.ieee.org/print/5049.
    \r\n\r\nA second strategy was to start to understand the physiological causes
    of eye fatigue. This work appeared in the most recent issue of Eye magazine: http://www.eyemagazine.com/opinion.php?id=157&oid=414\r\n\r\nCheers,
    Kevin\r\n"
