  probably businessmen, live in the city, maybe single. <BR>This is the first time
  I have ever hand lettered anything like this from sketch to screen.  I am going
  to post the basic black and white form first...it needs help.  still in the baby

  body: 'I think your sketch has lots of energy and the basic form is nicely balanced,
    particularly with the tagline below. <BR> <BR>My concern is that it look very
    <i>drawn on a computer</i>. Not a bad thing, just seeing some tortured beziers.
    I&#39;d suggest taking the basic form that you have &#40;which is nice&#41; and
    work it out on paper using a veriety of different writing instruments. Try pencil,
    try charcoal. try a thin and flexible watercolor brush. try fingerpainting, try
    a stick, use paint, use pastel, use ink. Draw it 100 times in less than an hour.
    Bang Bang Bang.  <BR> <BR>Then when you digitize it, it will have some vibrancy,
    but with consistency &#40;which I think is lacking now since you drew it with
    a digital tool, not a physical one&#41;. You don&#39;t have to be great with your
    hands to do expressive handcrafted work. Side note: The gi connection is distracting.  <BR>
    <BR>Good luck! <BR>Randy'

    could ever look aimed at the middle aged men market?  Or should I srap it and

  body: I think it would depend upon your middle-aged man. I&#39;m assuming this is
    for the &#34;metrosexual&#34; market &#40;those who genuinely do want to look
    model perfect&#41; and maybe those men like Jack Nicholson who we all perceive
    to be an absolute tiger and babe magnent.  <BR> <BR>Your lettering reminds me
    of P.Diddy for some reason. It is very urban. If someone wants to feel younger,
    or is perhaps going through midlife and wants to shake things up, your lettering
    could be very appealing. However, I think it needs more uniformity. Some of the
    shapes seem, too thin in spots. &#40;It&#39;s like bed linens, the higher the
    thread count, the higher the quality.&#41; Maybe you need to get some nice smooth
    vellum paper and a good new wedge marker and play with the sparking on some paper.
    Get the feel for what a graffiti artist can do.  <BR> <BR>Well, that&#39;s how
    I see it.

  body: ok - <BR> <BR>gild in my mind is the process of getting ready - - taking care
    of ones self.  Another gild definition could mean to encrust or coat something
    with gold.  I think it is a short strong word, that could be memorable in a good
    way. <BR> <BR>I thought maybe a gold foil for the logo on some crisp white stock
    might be nice for a label. Still working on that end... <BR> <BR>As I did my research
    it seems that most men&#39;s labels are very much like the example from Andrew
    Baker&#39;s above post...very minimalist.  I tend to work in that style, and it
    seems so obvious. So I was trying to get away from that...but maybe the best solution
    is a simple straightforward type solution like the gild in mrs. eaves.  I have
    another week to go so I am going to continue to explore the mark and also materials
    for the labeling and packaging. <BR> <BR>thanks a lot people  <BR> <BR>sx.

  body: I do not think you should have the phrase &#34;for men&#34;. The locations
    at which high quality and high end products are sold it is very clear if it is
    men or women. Thomas Pink in London ... the brand is called PINK ... but he specializes
    in men&#39;s &#40;and now women&#39;s&#41; fashion. Very high end.  <BR> <BR>I
    think using gold might be too obvious, are there other metals or textures that
    would be better? &#34;Yes, I can afford the Aston Martin Vanquish, but I&#39;m
    humble enough to stick to a nice Lamborghini Countach.&#34;  <BR> <BR>

    to gild means literally to coat in gold i&#39;m not sure if using another metal
    is approprate. maybe avoid the whole metalic vibe altogether and break the anticipated
    association? i had to chuckle as i was verifying the defintion, that a secondary
    definition is &#34;to make deceptively attractive&#34; very apropos for cosmetics

    you are right, maybe to close to the true intent of cosmetics.  To be honest though,
    the assignment is for shampoo, conditioner, and soap.  So, I was being a little
    broad with my cosmetics bit early on.  Although I don&#39;t think there would
    ever be a real brand that only did shampoo conditioner and bar soap... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Other name choices I have pondered:  Modello,
    robusto, modostile, luxe, modo, bloke, oakwood, churchill...thats most of them.
    <BR> <BR>So, I believe I will hold gild in reserve and back to the drawing board.  If
    you have any you all really like from the list above let me know... <BR> <BR>sx.'

  body: 'I like earlier idea using Mrs Eaves- simple , elegant, hits target audience..
    New concept does nothing for me. Considering the target audience I doubt it will
    be very functional. Shapes are clumsy and too playful, GI glyph is too abstract,
    varied line widths are too extreme, negative space is distractive. Looks like
    a cross between Cyrillic and Arabic, possibly illegible to someone who does not
    know what it is suppose to spell out. <BR>My suggestion- go back to original design

    perhaps made the base serifs on the i and l touch. Whether or not the subtitle
    says &#34;For Men&#34; is debatable, but I definitely think that a short caption
    completes the form of the marque since the lc binocular g ligature is such an
    optically large letter compared to the rest. Having &#34;For Men&#34; or &#34;Pour
    Hommes&#34; or similar floating under the text is a nice feature. <BR> <BR>But
    Vitus has a certain flair to it that I can&#39;t deny. More on that when we see
    a new version.
