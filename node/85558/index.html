  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody,

I am new to type designing and Fontlab Studio and for a while I have been working on my typeface, and now it is time to try to generate my font and make it work, I have set some kerning classes but I have problem generating my font which would include working kerning. I also get these messages when generating font:

<code>
[WARNING] <FONTnew-600> Glyph class @FONTnew-600 redefined [/Users/imac/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Features/fontlab.fea 24]
<code>
[NOTE] <FONTnew-600> Removing duplicate glyph <itilde> [/Users/imac/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Features/fontlab.fea 76]

These "warnings" and "notes" are actually pasted 15 more times but with different number at the end after "fontlab.fea", but didn't want to paste it here since it would be too large and awfull :) If it is important I can paste the whole text.

I assume that this happent to lot of people but I have tried searching through the internet and through this forum and haven't found a solution and I have a deadline about this since it is my bachelor work so if anyone could help I would really appreciate it very much!

Thanks in advance</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The numbers at the end of the error messages are line numbers, indicating which line of the feature code is causing the error. You can save the code to a text file from the dropdown menu in the OpenType panel, then open in a text editor and see if the referenced line numbers provide any clues to the errors. If your feature code is limited to kerning, you might also try Tools > Kerning Assistance to check for overlaps or other oddities, then update the kern feature.</div>

I have found that itilde was actually in two classes and delete it which resulted in removing the last error but still "glyph class.." and I'm dont have idea what does that mean.
As for the gargoyle's suggestion, it didn't give me much clue, thanks for the try :) It seems that "m" and "O" are overlapping, but "m" is defined in one class that I have only set to kern on the left side and the other to kern on the right side (im not sure how is this called, but in the classes panel I have checked left box for one class and right box for the second one) so I'm not sure how to set the class kerning right than?

Thanks again for your help</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You need to limit the kerning to something simple, make that work, and then build it up again. Save a copy of your font and delete all of the classes. Then start adding them and testing them, <em>one class at a time</em>, until you understand how to build working kerning classes. Then go back and fix the original font.</div>
