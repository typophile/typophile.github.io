body: "When doing some reading on book mold I read that the coated papers used for
  plates in old books are a favorite target of mold infestations. These papers seem
  pretty similar to the stocks used in late nineteenth and early to mid twentieth
  century type specimens, which seems to explain why every one I come across smells
  like my grandmother\u2019s basement. Is anyone aware of any measures that should
  be taken to keep these mold-magnets in better shape over time?"

    a good library; see whom they recommend. Good luck. I know that smell from the
    type specimen books of that era. Mine seem to be holding up well, though.\r\n\r\npowers "
