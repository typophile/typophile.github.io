  body: It would be better if you capture a frame of the credits and upload it here
    or at least (if the credits video is available somewhere online) post the video's
    URL and the exact time you are interested into.

    I strongly recommend you Mark Simonson's revival of it [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania|Bookmania]].
