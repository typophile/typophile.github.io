body: "London based FontSmith has released the new sans serif typeface Emeric. It
  is a strange animal, part humanist sans serif, but with very geometric shapes, and
  yet not a grotesk.\r\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about this typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fs-emeric-family_5524.gif]\r\n\r\nFor
  one I applaud the fresh approach and the absolutely distinctive and original <em>character</em>.
  Fontsmith has definitely created something new with its own, unique expression.
  On the other hand I feel that character has been taken too far in some ways, particularly
  with the lowercase letter <em>a</em>, which looks a bit like an accident, or the
  lowercase <em>g</em>, with its squashed lower bow ending, creating a blotched joining
  between the upper curve of the lower belly.\r\n\r\nMany glyphs have the feeling
  of metal being hammered and bent into shape.\r\n\r\nFeatures like these add to the
  overall distinction of the font, but they also make it look a bit amateurish. From
  the marketing and presentation of FontSmith (they asked great design studios to
  create posters with the new font), I take that <em>amateur</em> is not the impression
  they want to leave behind.\r\n\r\nI cannot say the font looks plain ugly. It does
  not. It has definitely a certain rugged charm to it, but it laso feels very unharmonic
  in some ways, and I have the feeling that I\u2019m noticing its imperfections too
  much to be forgiving, or getting used to read text written in this font. This may
  change after seeing it applied in various context. Emeric has some architectural
  touch to it I really like, especially in larger sizes. In smaller sizes I cannot
  help stumbling over the lowercase <em>g</em> with every line I read.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fsemeric.com/\r\nhttp://fontdeck.com/typeface/fsemeric\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/emeric_3982.gif]"

  body: "I like your review particularly the part with the metaphor for hammered metal,
    that\u2019s precisely describing my impression of the font. The lowercase \u201Cg\u201D
    is always a difficult letter, that offers a lot of room for personal opinion.
    Though i can\u2019t agree, that i stumble upon it, when i read it. But when i
    take a second look, i think the regular lowercase \u201Ca\u201D has a very rough
    round shape in the middle. And i instantly liked the concept of having a double
    story \u201Cg\u201D for the regular font-style and a single story for the italic.
    Same goes for the \u201Ca\u201D. The lowercase \u201Cc\u201D has a bit of a <em>big
    head</em> especially in Extra Bold font-style.\r\nAll in all i think that it\u2019s
    far from any <em>amateur-font</em>, but i think i see why you get an <em>amateurish</em>
    impression by taking a closer look. Anyway thanks for the review.\r\nbest regards"

  body: "Interesting design, and nice analysis.\r\n\r\nThere's a difference between
    not knowing how to make fonts versus <em>looking</em> like you don't... Quite
    often though it's pretty hard to tell the difference, and even though I'm not
    a fan of either I think the way one can incorporate \"undesign\" into a typeface
    does fascinate me. Even if the vast majority of \"undesign\" efforts are junk
    (what else is new?) I'm not sure this one is. And I might never be able to make
    up my mind...\r\n\r\nSee this too:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/dapifer/\r\nEverybody
    knows Darden can make polished fonts, so there's something else going on.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the link. I am not sure if Emeric is really <em>undesign</em>.
    I didn\u2019t mean to say it had an amateur approach. I don\u2019t know why exactly,
    but it reminds me of Liverpool in the fifties and steelworkers."
