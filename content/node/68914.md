body: "As websites have become more and more of cultural reference points, I'm curious
  how people approach the task of typesetting their names. When externally referring
  to a traditional piece of work \u2013 like a book \u2013 it is standard to typeset
  the title in italics (or in quotes, etc, depending on your style preference). For
  example\u2026\r\n\r\n\"I just finished reading <cite>Moby Dick</cite> last night.\"\r\n\r\nIn
  the past I've done something similar when referring to websites, but hesitantly
  so. It seems to make more sense for some websites than others, but I haven't figured
  out where to draw the line, or if a line should be drawn at all. Many of the standard
  style guides go in to detail about how to treat books, periodicals, poems, plays,
  articles, etc. However, the consideration of websites, blog posts, and other digitally
  published material still seems to be a gray area.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with any
  stylistic practice, it's flexible and subject to taste/cultural norms, but I'm curious
  about what thoughts other people have on the topic. I tried searching to see if
  this conversation has come up here before, but couldn't find anything of note; apologies
  if this might be a redundant thread."

  body: "As a technological side-note, I'm also curious how the topic of implementing
    such styles plays in to the picture with semantic web coding. For example, I used
    the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> HTML tag to italicize <cite>Moby Dick</cite> above,
    and have practiced a similar method in the past when mentioning book titles (as
    opposed to using <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>). However I'm
    not positive that's really what <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> was semantically intended
    for. From much of what I've read, it seems to have been introduced more for proper
    citation in the traditional sense \u2013 for attributing quotes and such \u2013
    than it is for simply mentioning a book's name in passing."

    blog entries), as are commonly used for albums/tracks or journals/articles. Thus:
    ''I just finished reading "GIF, H.264, and Patents" on <em>Daring Fireball</em>
    last night.'''

  body: "Using italics is, as you say, a stylistic convention, tied, among other things,
    to the language you are writing in.\r\nFor example, in Italian, titles of publications,
    be they books or magazines (and ships' names as well), would go in italics, but
    not articles, which would go between double quotes. Definitions too would go between
    double quotes, while the use of italics for emphasis was not common.\r\nSo, for
    websites, if they are in some way publications (as opposed to, say, brochures),
    I suppose you could use italics. The problem is that most often websites' names
    are hyperlinks too. That means they already have their styling distinct from the
    surrounding text. Adding italics to this styling can add visual clutter and reduce
    legibility.\r\nAs for what to use, the \"i\" tag is the only sensible one, maybe
    paired with an appropriate class. \r\nI say this exactly because it is semantically
    neutral."

  body: "That makes sense for relatively straightforward cases, like blogs with editorial
    content. But do you think it should apply to all sites? Like, would you italicize
    <cite>Typophile</cite>? I have a hard time answering that question decisively,
    and could go either way.\r\n\r\nAnd what about referring to the online publication
    of a news organization? The websites for newspapers often feature unique content
    and might be considered their own separate entities, but you rarely see something
    like \"Khoi Vinh is the design director for <cite>NYTimes.com</cite>.\""

    journal articles but I assume it would be proper to do so where that title appears

  body: "Nick, I would add that HTML is mark-up language primarily for the display
    of information, and not for its semantics. As such it is not a commendable storage
    format for content that needs to maintain the kinds of distinctions you have specified.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, you could achieve the desired effect by including a class attribute of your
    own devising in each cite tag, and controlling the output via a CSS rule. This
    would also allow a cleaner conversion of your HTML into a semantically richer
    mark-up at some point in the future, should the need arise."

    That is why &lt;strong> is used instead of &lt;b> and &lt;em> instead of &lt;i>.
    &lt;cite> is clearly to show a citation, not italicized text. CSS is the display
    element of the web, not HTML."

    on the web): stuctural and presentational semantics and not much more.\r\n\r\nStill,
    the examples of the &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; tags are in fact both presentational
    mark-up, rather than structural (much less lexical). They differ not in kind from
    &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; but only in degree of physical abstractness.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;
    and &lt;i&gt; are still valid tags, even in HTML5. "

  body: "Thanks all for the technical insight. What I'll probably end up adapting
    myself is a custom class. Unfortunately, that doesn't answer the question of what
    markup to use to refer to books on Typophile (I'll probably stick with <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>).\r\n\r\nIt
    also still leaves me a bit unsettled as to where I should even apply specialized
    typesetting or not \u2013 be it on my own site, Typophile, or any of the other
    places of varying code-flexibility that I might be writing. The recommendation
    Craig offers from Kate Turabian is a practical solution, but I can't help feeling
    that it implies an inferiority of any content that exists online\u2026 why should
    Huffington Post be treated any differently from <cite>New York Post</cite>?"
