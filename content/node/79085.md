  body: "The identical letters do look identical, but they could just be copies of
    each other. The R S, t and y seem designed to fit this logo. If any font is involved
    it was very highly customized.  \r\n\r\nThe net result is that I would just say
    'custom' and not a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
