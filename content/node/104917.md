  body: "Optical kerning is too unpredictable. Even if you do prefer its results for
    some text in some typefaces at some sizes, it would be unwise to state this as
    a general preference, because for other text in other typefaces at other sizes
    it might produce truly terrible results.\r\n\r\nWith the metrics setting, you
    get the kerning provided in the font. So how good those results are depend on
    how well made the font is. Again, it would be unwise to state this as a general
    preference, because some fonts are going to be better made than others.\r\n\r\nSo,
    you have to decide which option is best for the individual font and the text you
    are setting. I almost always use the metrics option, but then I only work with
    well-made fonts. I occasionally use the optical setting for larger size type --
    e.g. on title pages --, if the fonts have been kerned for text sizes, and then
    do manual editing. But in those cases my preference would be to use a display
    type that's been designed and kerned for those larger sizes.\r\n\r\n[BTW. The
    thread title is misleading. This is about kerning, not tracking.]"

    is also the question of taste.\r\nSome well-made fonts are strongly kerned, others
    not so much.\r\nI prefer less, these days.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is justi\uFB01cation
    style.\r\nWith ragged setting or a variable word space in justi\uFB01ed, strong
    kerning is \uFB01ne, but for a classic justi\uFB01ed setting with word space at
    100%, minimal kerning is more suited to the look.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting
    if one could adjust kerning globally, the same way one adjusts tracking.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe
    kerning of Richler is designed for text setting; I recommend people consider Optical
    for display settings.\r\n"

    our shop (& I'm talking about typesetting, not design), we just assume any display
    type will need manual kerning. Even if there is a \"Display\" font, what works
    at 24 or 36 point won't work at 72 point, and what is best depends on not just
    a pair of letters, but the entirety of the display text.\r\n\r\nUse this frame
    of reference. We charge between $3.75 and $4.00 a page for setting text, and $8.50
    a page for front mater display. (Let's leave out questions like is that for \"editorially
    correct on disk\" [yes] and  \"does that include proof sets\" [no], etc, etc.,
    it's that <strong>ratio</strong> that matters.) And BTW, the dedication page and
    copyright page don't usually take that long, the halftitle is only one line of
    type, and even the contents page is usually reasonably quick. All that money (usually
    $42.50 to $51.00) is really spent on the title page, you just can't submit a bill
    in that form. \r\n\r\nThat money -- time, really -- is spent on handwork, necessary
    even after the interior designer has specified all the typefaces, type sizes,
    linespacing,  and line breaks, etc. I plan on spending between 30 minutes to an
    hour setting the all the front matter -- over half of it on the title page --
    \ and we lose money on the setting of it.\r\n\r\nFor text, \"handwork\" should
    be limited to things that cannot be kerned in a font, such as kerning across fonts
    -- an italic d or l or i followed by a roman close parenthesis or roman close
    quotes. This is the only place we use optical kerning, and it is only a starting
    point  -- we have a script that fetches one instance of every pair that involves
    two fonts. (Actually, the script also notes the number of times that pair occurs
    in a text, but that's just to show how important the pair might be.) When the
    pair is presented, it is shown with optical kerning. If that's good, we leave
    it alone; if not, we enter a hard kern. Then a second script goes & puts all those
    kerns, either the instruction to use optical kerning with the pair, or a hard
    kern,  in the setting file.\r\n\r\nAs John said, the results of optical kerning
    are variable. I would say you cannot trust it in setting long runs of text. If
    the kerning within a font is not up to snuff, you either modify it in the font
    (best, if the EULA allows), or kern it external to the font with an auxiliary
    program. Otherwise, use a different font. For an interior designer to say \"Oh,
    the letterforms are so pretty\" or something like that, is just not professional. "
