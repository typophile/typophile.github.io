  drags on system time caused by use of web fonts on our mobile websites. One of our
  product leads is lobbying heavily for strict use of \"system fonts\" on mobile devices.
  By system fonts, he's referring to San Francisco (iOS) and Roboto (Android). Perhaps
  best way for me to ask my question is to state how this works and ask you kind people
  to savage me where I am incorrect. OK? Here's how I think this works.\r\n-- San
  Fran and Roboto are natively installed on iOS and Android devices.\r\n-- Although
  San Fran and Roboto are system fonts, they are not browser default fonts. Browser
  defaults are Arial, Helvetica, etc.\r\n-- If I use San Fran or Roboto in my mobile
  web design, I call it in my CSS, as I would with any web font. The difference is
  that the native font is preloaded. So I don't have any millisecond lag while I load
  a web font that is not native to the device.\r\n-- If I load a web font, a user
  experiences a slight lag (milliseconds) on first load. After that, the font is cached,
  so there is little or no difference in load time between the native font and web
  font on subsequent site visits.\r\n-- Because native fonts are not browser defaults,
  there is still a FOUT possibility, although a bit smaller chance perhaps.\r\n\r\nAm
  I close? Any help appreciated. Thank you."

    fonts are the first choice for browser defaults; hence the old selections of Times
    New Roman, Arial and Courier New on Windows systems and Times, Helvetica and Courier
    on Apple systems. Anyway, googling for, say, 'system fontfamily' should help you
    find some pointers from others that have been through these headaches."
