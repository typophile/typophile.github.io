  body: 'Depends on what you&#39;re looking for.  <BR>The Hendel book is more about
    how different book designers approach books. <BR>Marshall Lee&#39;s book was seen
    to be the definitive guide to basic book design. Its based on his first edition
    which was written in 1965 so not sure how it deals with present day production
    techniques. One similar to this is Adrian Wilson&#39;s book. <BR>The Hochuli book
    is a great one to own as its a lovely book in itself and a good introduction to
    various aspects of book design: different kinds of books, parts of a book... <BR>
    <BR>There&#39;s also: <BR>Five Hundred Years of Book Design: Alan Bartram <BR>
    <BR>Methods of Book Design: Hugh Williamson <BR> <BR>Notes on Book Design: Derek
    Birdsall'
