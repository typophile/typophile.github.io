body: "I was looking around at the websites of typographers earlier today, and came
  across the site of one independent designer (whom I shall not name) which looked
  so broken on my computer I had to email him and explain what was wrong with his
  HTML and CSS, and how standards-compliant coding practices would rectify them. I
  am a professional web developer and like to educate others about web standards and
  accessibility, to help improve the web in my own little way. The response I got
  back, however, shocked me:\r\n\r\n\"These are all visual problems caused by your
  settings. The site was meant to be viewed the way I designed it. I won't tailor
  the site to meet every possible variable of every combination of browser customizations.\"\r\n\r\nMy
  'settings and customisations' were choosing a preferred font other than Times, increasing
  the minimum font size, and increasing the line height in my browser's preferences.
  This is so that I do not encounter illegible text. I am short-sighted, and my sight
  gets worse later in the day when my eyes tire or I start to slouch.\r\nThese are
  standard preferences that every browser has available, and I know most people who
  care about type aesthetics (i.e. the design\u2010orientated folks likely to his
  web site) will set such preferences to their liking.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to
  specifically code to \"meet every possible variable\", by using a flexible layout,
  and realising that the web is not the printed page\u2014you do not have absolute
  control over how your site looks on your visitors machines\u2014you can produce
  a site that looks great on everyone's screen, regardless of their preferred font
  size.\r\n\r\nI reminded him that the only computer on which his site can \"be viewed
  the way he designed it\" was his own. I will no longer be recommending this designer
  to my clients. I hope the people coming to this forum are not as narrow minded.\r\n\r\n\u2212

  body: "\"The site was meant to be viewed the way I designed it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is
    why a lot of architects, photographers, etc sites have really crappy web sites.
    It's in the nature of a visual designer to want to have control and it's hard
    to let that go when putting yourself online."

  body: "I agree with everything that has been said. I'm not a web designer, but I
    do try to educate myself concerning best web practices and standards. I'm not
    even a real graphic designer. I'm more of an enthusiast. But when it comes to
    the internet, I applaud most attempts to make the web look more like print if
    they end up being accessible too. A good example would be [[http://www.jasonsantamaria.com|Jason
    Santa Maria]]. \r\n\r\nAll of this brings me to my point: I dislike the idea of
    overriding the font choices consciously (and hopefully wisely) made by the designer
    of the site with your preferred setting. While that might not be a problem in
    fluid layouts (which almost invariably look awful), it can be with a fixed layout.
    I myself \"care about type aesthetics\" and that is why I never change the browser's
    viewing preferences to my liking because I want to view the site the way the designer
    intended. He chose, per se, Georgia over Verdana, because that's what compliments
    his layout and design best. \r\n\r\nLet me add a disclaimer, Nick, in that your
    short-sightedness warrants tampering with these settings, but wouldn't Ctrl+scroll
    do enough while, at the same time, \"preserving\" the design? I'd find the web
    to be extremely bland were it set in just Verdana (or Arial!)... It's an interesting
    topic nonetheless, so if anyone cares to share their opinion, please do."
