  body: Thanks Hrant, how about the stem of "r" and "a"? I feel the "a" and "p" are
    falling a bit to the right. Could the connector between them be the cause? I noticed
    it just now.

  body: I like this! I'm wondering, though, whether the W and the rap are not too
    different from each other in style; the latter's round, regular, relatively low-contrast
    shapes may clash with the rather more dynamic style of the W.

    also adjusted \"W\" in the latter version . How do you think it fares now?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wrap_02_6732.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/wrap_04_5038.jpg]"
