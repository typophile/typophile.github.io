  Sounds like a great opportunity, but I'm no way capable or educated enough to design
  non-Roman glyphs.\r\n\r\nNot willing to dismiss a potential business opportunity,
  I'd like to get some advice on how to approach this. Should I commission the bigger,
  capable foundries to take my designs and expand it? Any other options?"

    experience in these areas.

    you're good at Latin type design, and you mind\r\ngiving away the work, you can
    probably handle\r\nCyrillic yourself, BUT with an advisor proficient\r\nin the
    script. In the relevant recent past I've had\r\ntwo Cyrillic commissions (one
    for a computer game\r\ndesign firm in the UK, the other a shipping-label-\r\nprinting
    company in Germany) and in both cases\r\nI did all the work, then ran it by somebody
    with\r\nnativity (who helped me refine it).\r\n\r\nArabic is a whole different
    story... Not only is it\r\nmuch further from Latin in structure, but there\r\nare
    serious technical hurdles to master. I myself\r\nenjoy nativity in Arabic, but
    cannot produce a\r\nworking font on my own. So for Arabic you might\r\nhave to
    subcontract it entirely, or have a couple\r\nof people on it: one for the forms,
    the other for all\r\nthe coding. If you do the latter please do consider\r\nme
    for the design (although there are many others\r\nwho can do better -for example
    John- but most of\r\nthem cost more :-).  hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nBTW,
    Merge seems well suited to Arabic! If it were\r\na more texty font you'd have
    more trouble making\r\nthe Arabic happy. Speaking of happy: many people\r\nwho
    make Cyrillic fonts would disagree, but to me it\r\nshould have a larger \"x-height\"
    than the Latin (even\r\nthough this refinement applies more to text fonts).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Maxim Zhukov be hired as an expert reviewer. There are lots of people with experience
    of Cyrillic typeface design... and there are also a lot of not very good or really
    quite bad Cyrillic typefaces out there, including many designed by native readers.
    Maxim is a true expert in Cyrillic typography: former typographic coordinator
    of the United Nations, and consultant to ParaType, Microsoft, Tiro Typeworks and
    many others. I like the look of your Merge family, and it deserves a refined Cyrillic
    companion, not something cobbled together from bits a pieces of the Latin, which
    is alas what often happens.\r\n\r\nFor the Arabic design, consider <a href=\"http://www.tntypography.com/\">Titus
    Nemeth</a> (if he has time; he is working on his PhD) or our friend <a href=\"http://www.hibastudio.com/\">Hasan

  body: "Nick,\r\n<blockquote>A world authority on Cyrillic is not necessary if one
    is sticking to basic encoding.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI presume you mean by this
    the basic Russian alphabet plus Slavic extensions, i.e. not Turkic, Mongolian
    etc.. Actually, I'd say that it is precisely in designing this core set of Slavic
    letterforms that expert advice is most important: the extensions for Central Asian
    languages are mostly quite easy and derived from this core set of shapes, so if
    you get the basic alphabet right then the rest comes easily.\r\n\r\nDespite having
    designed several Cyrillic types over the past fifteen years, and having won awards
    for Cyrillic type design in Russia, I still find Maxim's review of my work to
    be very valuable. Most importantly, he has an excellent grasp of stylistic idiom,
    recognising which forms of particular letters are most appropriate to a particular
    style of type, and vast historic knowledge that enables him to suggest appropriate
    design solutions that might not occur to less experienced and knowledgeable designers.
    And he has a very refined feel for relative proportion, especially with regard
    to the widths of letters, that is crucial to the texture of Cyrillic text. Over
    the years, my own feeling for this has improved dramatically under Maxim's guidance,
    but he still suggests improvements that I find it worthwhile to make, however
    small. These two areas -- stylistic idiom and relative proportions -- are typically
    the weakest parts of a lot of Cyrillic type design -- resulting in Frankenstein
    constructions and poor page texture --, even by native users of the script, and
    hence why I consider Maxim good value for money as a consultant.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>would
    a world authority on Latin be necessary</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf I were looking
    to commission a designer to extend one of my typefaces to any script with which
    I was not personally familiar, as is the case for Kosal with regard to Cyrillic,
    I would want an independent review of the quality by someone who is a knowledgeable
    and experienced expert in the typography of that script. Since such experts for
    many scripts are few and far between, they tend to be recognised as 'world authorities'."

    your design should conform to convention, but to explain the conventions, illustrate
    the variety within the conventions, the relationship between different idiomatic
    styles (and hence the potential for crossover and hybrid solutions), etc.. Again,
    I see evident lack of such knowledge in a lot of Cyrillic type design, including
    that done by native users of the script.\r\n\r\n<em>If you hire a designer on

    script, how is one to judge whether a designer knows his stuff? All too often,
    when it comes to non-Latin type design, being a native reader of the script is
    taken as sufficient qualification along with the designer's own claims. Or as
    a friend of mine, an Indian typographer, put it when approached by a foundry about
    designing typefaces -- something she has never done -- 'They think I'm the right
    colour for the job'."

  body: "On the general topic, if Unicode had been a glyph set instead of a character
    set, it would have been much simpler for people to design fonts that covered many
    languages, since the intelligence of choosing which alternative glyph to use based
    on linguistic rules would be in the operating system, not in the font.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, there's an obvious problem with that. That would mean, for example, that
    all Arabic fonts would have to be Naksh fonts - and never Nasta`liq fonts. Unless
    one had a separate set of code positions for that writing style, but, of course,
    that would mean that a certain, possibly imperfect, mechanization of that style
    would be, if not \"set in stone\", at least beset with delaying obstacles to change."
