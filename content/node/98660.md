  first, Miraculum, is a hoppy IPA with a viney & floral hand drawn mark.\r\nhttp://cl.ly/image/3k3f0b003501\r\n\r\nThe
  second, Cadre, is a smooth brown ale, displayed as a curvy black letter.\r\nhttp://cl.ly/image/1A423t2g0b08\r\n\r\nThe
  third, Villain, is a red IPA that's shown in a minimalistic comic book style, similar
  to sin city.\r\nhttp://cl.ly/image/1n160M0u142l\r\n\r\nThe final mark, Grand Pryes,
  is a cream ale shown here in a reflective, half dressed, robust serif font.\r\nhttp://cl.ly/image/3u0O2D2u2W2R\r\n\r\n\r\n-
  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBen"

    and professional, I guess :) I'm starting a brewery with two friends, a brewer
    and a businessman - Sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, hehehe."

  body: "Hard to evaluate a logo without knowing what qualities and feelings you're
    trying to communicate via the logo. \r\n\r\nBut in general I like them. I'd rotate
    Miraculum (which is my favorite) slightly so the verticals in the M are vertical,
    not leaning back. Villain I find a little hard to read."

    help us to better judge the suitability of the logos! ;-)"
