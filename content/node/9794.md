body: Looks familiar. Spiky R should be a giveaway... <BR> <BR>also, is the italic
  part of the same family? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67491.jpg"

  body: It seems to match Bitstream&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aldine-401/">Aldine
    401</a>, which is their Bembo ripoff. It&#39;s also possible that it&#39;s a real
    Bembo with an alt R with a shorter tail. <BR> <BR>And yes, the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bembo/italic/testdrive.html?s=by+Chuck+Byrne+and+Martha+Witte+1&amp;p=24">Italic</a>
    of the same family also seems to match.
