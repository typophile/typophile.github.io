body: The variation in thickness and symmetry of a type's [[stroke]] or outlines.
  Degree of modulation covers a very wide range, from zero modulation ([[monolinear]])
  to the subtle variation of a stressed linear type, and strokes so erratic they are
  classified as fractured. Modulation is related to the [[cursive]] property, or condition
  of being cursive.
