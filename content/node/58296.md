  My dream firm would be Pentagram if we can afford them, and I can''t think of any
  other firm that comes close to them in terms of quality and experience. Thanks for
  any suggestions. '

  body: "It's our quarterly alumni magazine. Usually around 64-72 pages; 75%-25% editorial/ad
    ratio; circulation about 180,000.\r\n\r\nThanks Michael :) We've considered doing
    it in house, although I don't think I would have the time necessary to spend on
    the redesign that it deserves. Plus, it's always beneficial to have the perspective
    of someone from the outside. Third... I'm definitely no Pentagram!\r\n\r\nThanks
    7; I'll look into them. Anybody know who designed Martha Stewart's Blueprint a
    couple years back?\r\n\r\nBlake"
