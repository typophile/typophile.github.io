  body: "Indeed it's Akzidenz-Grotesk, cheers. Is it a bold though? He did do this
    before digital, but it looks to me that the weight (both the heading and body
    copy) is in a weight between Medium and Bold? Or maybe the bleeding deceives me.\r\n\r\nGood
    duess on the tiny print, you have better eyes than me. Here is a slightly bigger
    version of anyone finds the last words in the print: http://www.blanka.co.uk/i/products/815.jpg"

  body: "I checked the book (Josef M\xFCller-Brockmann, Ein Pionier der Schweizer
    Grafik) and Florian's reading of the small text is correct. (Except they spelled
    \xABlithographie\xBB with \xABph\xBB back then, and I'm not sure if there's a
    period or comma in the middle, in case that matters.)\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, this is
    one of the many many examples from the heyday of the Swiss style that use Akzidenz
    Grotesk. I'm sure the weights differ at least slightly from the digital versions,
    but Linotype AG Bold doesn't seem very far away from this, no?"
