body: Hi.  Can anyone identify this font?  Also, if you have any suggestions for this
  style of type and font pairings for a chic theme party.  I want it to look sophisticated,
  but have to present some ideas with more of a Moroccan flare.  Ideas?  Thanks!

    or something along those lines might be good, there was a band graphic with a
    very similar script identified here about 4(?) months ago, maybe someone with
    a better memory than me will remember it.\r\nTim"

    font doesn't come up.\r\n\r\nI have a font called \"arabia\" which is similar
    but not a match. It's from fontographer so not available. Another one is called
    Aladdin, but I can't find it either."

    brother of <a href="http://www.dafont.com/aladdin.font">Aladdin</a>. But both
    are just similar ...

    from Canada Type (a revival of 'Privat' by Joachim Siercke) has alternate characters
    that have a similar flare, and could make a good substitute if the original can't
    be found. I have a feeling this might be a font from Scriptorium -- at least I
    think it looks familiar. Still checking Part 4 of the Script Guide...\r\n\r\n-

    'Caliph', which is a version of Legende/Aladdin.\r\n\r\nOther fonts are 'Pide

    fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
