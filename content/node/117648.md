body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/800px-Greek_Handwriting-aaa3_4794.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is a font created by Carl Faulmann. It's found in the book \"Das Buch der Schrift.
  Enthaltend die Schriftzeichen und Alphabete aller Zeiten und aller V\xF6lker des
  Erdkreises, Vienna 1880\" I was wondering if anyone can find a place to download
  this font."

  body: "Hi Clark,\r\nI think the market is very small considering Greek calligraphy
    fonts and most probably you can't find this one in digital form. \r\nThe closer
    I can see to your sample (not very close indeed) is the Greek version of Vivace,
    called <strong>CF Vivace</strong> and designed by Vladimir Radibratovic [1999]
    for Cannibal Fonts.\r\nSee the image bellow for a comparison:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CFVivace-grek_4525.jpg]"
