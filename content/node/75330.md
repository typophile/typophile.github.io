body: What is the correct way of emphasizing (with italics) a word followed by a punctuation
  mark like ,!?)" ? Do you emphasize it including the mark or only the word itself?

  body: I generally italicize/embolden punctuation as well. This is something you
    should discuss with the editor of the text because it can get weird with lots
    of quotations or complex citation system.

  body: "It depends on context and meaning. For example, there is difference between:\r\n<em>Should
    I emphasise everything?</em> \u2013 and \u2013 Should I emphasise <em>everything</em>?"

  body: 'I''ve learned to italicize the punctuation mark - not because it is a crucial
    part of the emphasis but because it shouldn''t draw attention to itself (like
    your second comma example does). I''ll obviously reconsider if italicizing draws
    more attention to it. '

    part of the expression getting emphasis, but rather a structural element of the
    entire sentence. However, in some instances an italic comma will fit better than
    a Roman one so, aesthetically, using the italic comma might look better. If the
    project is not academic in nature, I would go with what looks best, rules be damned..."
