  this weekend but have a background in FrameMaker.\r\n\r\nI'm tidying up some localized
  files and all's going quite smoothly except that on a few occasions the text from
  a text box (callout) is appearing on the page following the location of the actual
  text box. I can't seem to cut and paste the text into the existing text box but
  when I try to delete the text box and create a new one, that too won't allow me
  to place the text inside. I've tried to send back/backward the frame containing
  the graphic but to no avail.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that there could be a number of
  reasons for this and it's difficult to diagnose without seeing the file but any
  suggestions would be gratefully accepted!\r\n\r\n[InDesign CS2 on Windows]"
