  body: "I looked through the 22 pages of  Part 14 (the Strange, Distressed scripts)
    of the Script Font ID Guide. I did not find an exact match for this dry brush
    lettering, but I found a couple of very similar fonts. See <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg14.html
    target=\"new\">Young Itch</a>, from Astigmatic One Eye; and <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg16.html
    target=\"new\">Teebrush Paint (and Alt)</a> from Linotype.\r\n\r\nI believe your
    sample is unquestionably a font, but it may be a custom one, since it falls under
    the hand-printed font category of fonts that can be made easily and cheaply from
    lettering samples.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
