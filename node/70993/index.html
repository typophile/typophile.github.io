		<div class="commentbody"><p>You don&rsquo;t need to say &ldquo;Contact Information&rdquo; and keep your website with your other contact info.</p>
<p>The ital you are using looks smaller and somewhat condensed compared to the roman and thus of less importance. Perhaps switching your job and schools to be roman and the following info in the ital. Or try setting the italic a little larger.</p>
<p>Overall it looks unbalanced with a narrow margin on the left and a very wide margin on the right.</p>
<p>As Aluminum said HTML and CSS should be ALL CAPS not large and small caps.</p>
<p>Delete the duration of your internship and &ldquo;Hope to hear from you soon&rdquo; the later can be the sign off of your cover letter but it&rsquo;s not appropriate on a resume.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your name centered with the rest of the copy flush left there should be more space between the two. It&rsquo;s not a rule but often you will see resumes have the name and contact info centered and then the body of the resume is set flush left.</p>
<p>There should be more info about your job and colleges; where they are and the year you worked/graduated. List the few design classes you too at SDSU rather than say &ldquo;took several design classes, but mostly arts and crafts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Your interests don&rsquo;t tell us anything new. Either delete entirely or list your specific arts and crafts here.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I suggest dropping the Interests section. Also, I think the headings need a little more to set them off from the content; centered headings works, or you could place the headings to the left and the content to the right.</p>
<p>Education typically refers only to degrees that you have earned; if you want to discuss specific classes, I think a Coursework section would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>I would avoid sub-headings such as &ldquo;Experience,&rdquo; &ldquo;Duration,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Responsibilities.&rdquo; Instead, simply state what you did: &ldquo;Designed fliers for several Latino Film Festival events, as well as banners for the company&rsquo;s website, mediaartscenter.org.&rdquo; Always use &ldquo;strong action words&rdquo; in the past tense. Also, I&rsquo;m fairly certain URLs technically should be italicized.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;d advise dropping the &ldquo;Duration&rdquo; sub-heading, how long you&rsquo;ve done things should be included, in the form of start and end dates. Include the month and the year: &ldquo;August 2005 to May 2007.&rdquo; This applies to any jobs, internships, education, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good that you dropped the Personal Statement section; however, a similar Objective section may be in order. Remember that you should never submit a generic résumé! Each one should be custom-tailored for the specific job you want. In which case, stating a description of said job is easy, eg &ldquo;An entry-level document design position,&rdquo; &ldquo;An entry-level web design and development position,&rdquo; or something along those lines. If you&rsquo;re just writing a generic résumé, then omit the Objective section.</p>
<p>When you write your cover letter, be sure to refer to the résumé (eg &ldquo;As stated on the enclosed résumé&hellip;&quot;). As Kris10 points out, the &ldquo;I hope to hear from you soon!&rdquo; would be a good conclusion for your cover letter, but I&rsquo;d advise staying away from words like &ldquo;hope,&rdquo; &ldquo;want,&rdquo; &ldquo;if,&rdquo; etc, as these do not convey confidence. Its a good idea to give them your contact info to close the cover letter, and close confidently: &ldquo;I can be contacted by phone at 619-757-7310 or by email at <a href="mailto:etahchen@hotmail.com">etahchen@hotmail.com</a>. I look forward to meeting you soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Be sure to print both on résumé paper as well—the person reading this will be very busy, and likely has a bunch of other applicants to go through. Its likely that they will look at your résumé for 3 to 5 seconds, so you have to make an excellent impression!</p>
<p>As with all of my posts, take it with a grain of salt, but those are my suggestions&hellip;. and sorry to be so lengthy; I&rsquo;m just a bit of a stickler when it comes to résumés. Good luck!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eh, I think you&rsquo;re giving too much information.</p>
<p>Under work experience, nobody cares that you only worked 2 months because school etc. Just put the months you worked. When was it? It should read:</p>
<p>Work Experience</p>
<p>Media Arts Center - Design Internship
May - August 2010 (insert the correct months here)
Designed fliers for various Latino Film Festival events, designed web banners for the website, <a href="http://www.mediaartscenter.org">http://www.mediaartscenter.org</a>.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Southwestern College, (insert where/when it was)
Associates Degree in Graphic Design</p>
<p>San Diego State University, (insert where/when it was)
Bachelors Degree in Applied Design</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason for the other information you have given. It might help to actually read some other resumes&hellip; Here&rsquo;s mine, for example: <a href="http://www.studioimbrue.com/resume.pdf">http://www.studioimbrue.com/resume.pdf</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Looking much better! If you could include dates for your time at Southwestern and SDSU, that would be good. Also, for the schools, you don&rsquo;t need the whole address. Just the city and state will be fine. For dates, the exact day isn&rsquo;t necessary; just put the month and year.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to make it longer, you could include a Coursework section, describing specific courses you&rsquo;ve taken that are relevant for the job you are applying for. Write it in the same way you write the work experience section.</p>
<p>In the previous version, you had a lot of writing under each section. As Steven said, that is too much information—for a résumé. Don&rsquo;t trash those thoughts altogether, because they may well be appropriate for your cover letter.</p>
<p>On a side note, please make sure that the entries under each heading are sequenced <em>from most recent to most long ago.</em> It&rsquo;s a bit of a pesky detail, but I&rsquo;d advise paying attention to it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Just a thought, I recently did a resume for my current job and I did something that included graphics that went over pretty well. If you are planning to hand this to creative-types, it could go over well. I would say to line break at &ldquo;Festival events and &hellip; etc&rdquo; and use that half of your resume for an image that really showcases your work. Simple, clear, precise work. Maybe even an image similar to your website header, but black and white. Just some thoughts!</div>
