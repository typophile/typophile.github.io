  <BR> <BR>Apparently its a version of News Gothic used by IBM in the 60&#39;s and
  Im desperate to get hold of it. <BR> <BR>Any help would be great as I have already
  stumped all of my peers with this one. <BR> <BR>Best

    Gothic &#34;golf ball&#34; for the Selectric - for <BR>which the face was designed.
    There are <BR>examples of this face in the Karel Martens <BR>&#34;Printed Matter&#34;
    book. If my memory <BR>serves, the examples are naturally very <BR>small. Although,
    you would think there are <BR>some specimens somewhere.
