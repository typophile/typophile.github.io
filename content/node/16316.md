body: "I'm designing a suite of logos for a youth clearinghouse and some of the names
  are crazily long (one has 4 words: 10 letters, then 5, then 5, then 5) are there
  good guidelines for this kind of thing? For example, am I obligated to capitalise
  the initial letter of each word? Is it uncool to resize/kern all caps words out
  until they form a nice block? does it makes sense to keep the face light because
  of the sheer number of letters?\r\n\r\nI am interested to hear how others have addressed
  this problem"

    in that part of the process?\r\n\r\nI've worked on a couple of projects branding
    suites of software where we've first thought about the name heirarchy. Does your
    project have a name common to the whole suite? The various derivatives could then
    work like a descritpor or be an acronym (not ideal, I know)"

    body: "Yes, this was useful thanks. As far as naming goes, each name in the suite
      is already established as an entity (it's redesign) so renaming s'not really
      a goer. Perhaps it really is a time thing, the more exposure a particular logo
      gets, the more well-known it becomes and the more confident you can be to dispense
      with elongated versions \r\n"
