  the wealth of info. \r\n\r\nQuestion: I am making a promo card for \"Minute Taking
  Made Easy\" workshop and am looking for a really sloppy handwriting font, that at
  the same time is extremely legible (to use as a headline). Looking for ink blotches,
  crossed over letters, scrathes etc. The postcard will also have a picture of a frustrated
  secretary on it. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\nNatalia. "
