body: "\r\nThis probably has a very easy answer but I don't have a solution and would
  love one. I always fall into the trap of unpaid fonts for clients, as I need to
  present the font within my designed styleframe and I can't option this with paid
  fonts. Sometimes I've used the character generator, taken a screen grab, pulled
  a luma key... but it's clunky and doesn't look great and not always workable. I'd
  love to offer paid fonts to clients but I can't afford to pay for a bunch at risk
  of them not being accepted... Surely other designers face this problem, or am I
  missing an easy workaround??"

    in after effects but I can use photoshop as a clunky workaround.\r\n\r\ndidn't
    know about typekit either, their lists look good.\r\n\r\nare there any other font
