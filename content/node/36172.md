body: "Shortly after the death of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, presumably by the end of
  the year of 1930, the American publishing house Doubleday & Company brought out
  the 1122-page complete edition \"The Complete Sherlock Holmes\" with a preface by
  Christopher Morley. There have been innumerable stereotyped (or perhaps electrotyped)
  reprinted by Doubleday, and much later innumerable offset reprints based on the
  very same text which was typeset in the early 1930s.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sherlock Holmes
  works entered public domain fifty years later, the British publishing house Penguin
  Books started in 1981 to publish paperback offset reprints of the 1122-page Doubleday
  hardcover edition. I have both editions - hardcover by Doubleday and softcover by
  Penguin -, but both editions, due to the innumerable reprints, the text is so very
  much \"blurred\" (or \"mackled\", as printers say) that it turned out to be a difficult
  \"Holmes case\" to identify the typeface used in the early 1930s for typesetting
  this famous Sherlock Holmes edition.\r\n\r\n(Note: The entire text of this Doubleday
  edition, using the very same page numbers, is also available here for download in
  electronic form: http://camdenhouse.ignisart.com/canon/index.html)\r\n\r\nI uploaded
  two sample pages from the printed Doubleday edition\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/holmes1.gif
  (title page)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/holmes2.gif (preface)\r\n\r\nAlthough
  I scanned these sample pages with extremely high resolution, it was by no means
  easy to find out the name of the typeface used for typesetting this famous Sherlock
  Holmes edition.\r\n"

    one.\r\n\r\nYour sample is awfully large and the resolution is a mess, so it's
    hard to tell."

    subtle differences.

    of the reprint.\r\n\r\nHowever, I added a color scan, perhaps it is better:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/holmes3.jpg\r\n"

    is one of his fonts.

    in metal with the bigger x-height. Shame about the quality of the reprint."

  body: Dwiggins designed a Holmes in 1950-52. Are you sure that's not the version
    you have?

    The Cursive is a dead give-away.\r\n\r\nThis is very very excellent indeed.\r\n\r\nI
    uploaded a letterpress Electra specimen from 1950 as this scan:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/holmes4.jpg\r\n\r\nHowever,
    there is a big riddle to be solved by some sleuth such as Sherlock Holmes. As
    I said and as is proved, the 1122-page Doubleday edition, a copy of which is available
    in the Library of Congress, was published in 1930:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/holmes5.jpg\r\n\r\nAnd
    now the big riddle: The Electra typeface by Dwiggins is said to have been designed
    after 1930, namely 5 years later in 1935. How is is possible that Doubleday used
    a font in 1930, which did not exist in 1930? This is a big riddle which can only
    be solved, if a typographical sleuth can prove that Dwiggins designed Electra
    at least in 1930, i.e. at least 5 years earlier than the year given by most typeface
    historians in various typography books and also by Linotype in its most recent
    catalogs.\r\n\r\nI should add that designing (on paper) was not enough. For typesetting
    the huge 1122-page complete edition, the matrices or punches had to finished too
    in the year 1930.\r\n"

  body: I just checked the big colour scan and I can confirm this is Electra, which
    makes this whole identification an honest-to-God X-files case. What happened in
    those lost five years? :^/
