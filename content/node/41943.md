body: A few years back when film was still the main format submitted to magazines
  the company I art direct for had the magazine dimensions set at 8x10.5". Now with
  digital images being 98% of our magazine I am finding my self cropping near 1 inch
  off the images. Is creating a magazine at 8x12" too skinny or too expensive? What
  are your thoughts?

    a printer lined up I would talk to them about this new dimension and tell them
    your concerns. It could be that the parent sheet they are using would allow for
    8x12 and might even result in less waste.

  body: "Could have to do with film format vs digital image ratio(s). 8*10.5 inch
    almost corresponds with 4 by 5 film (there even is a film format 8 by 10 inches).
    Digital camera\u2019s (esp r SLR\u2019s) have sensors that correspond with 24*36
    mm film format, most of them also can deliver High Def like ratio\u2019s that
    are 'thinner'. As a lot of image content is used for the new media these modern
    image ratio\u2019s gain ground. \r\n\r\nRe format: I like the squarer format better.
    Also a consideration: spreads look better.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: 'The 8x10" format was chosen to reduce costs after publishers learned that
    they could sell magazines with a catchy photo and type than with a large format
    and illustrated covers. IIRC magazines started shrinking in the late 1960s, and
    by the early 1980s almost all magazines and comic books were printed in the smaller
    sizes. '

  body: Newspapers are also shrinking. It's mainly a money issue, though they also
    claim (and fair enough, I suppose) that it's 'greener' to use less paper.
