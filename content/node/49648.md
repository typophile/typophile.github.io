  be similar and at least serif font.  I realize this is a logo and has been tweaked
  some but I need to come as close as possible.  Thanks so much for any help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BRA_4669.jpg]"

  body: "It seems obvious to me that this lettering has been hand-drawn, since every
    'e' (for example) is slightly different from each other 'e'.  I think this look
    is most like the sort of revivals that Nick Curtis does. Search on his name at
    MyFonts, or have a look through his early freeware fonts at [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/index.htm|TypOasis]].\r\n\r\nHis
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/boxcar-willie-nf/|Boxcar Willie]] has
    initials somewhat like your sample, and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/packard-patrician-nf/|Packard
    Patrician]] (based on Cooper's Packard type) might work for the lower case. URW's
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/artcraft/|Artcraft Bold]] may be even closer
    for the lower case, and is from the same time period as Packard.\r\n\r\n - Mike

  body: "Oh, and as far as the counter shading, I think you will need to add that
    yourself as an after effect. One of the few fonts I know with similar 'toothed'
    highlighting was called \"Greco Adornado\", but it seems to have been renamed
    to something I can't recall. A similar shading style is used on fonts [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/vinyl/sawtooth/|ITC
    Vinyl Sawtooth]] and Letraset [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/zaragoza/|Zaragoza]],
    neither of which is much like your lettering. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
