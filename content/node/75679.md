body: Cap heights of serif fonts tend to be shorter than in sans. Is this done to
  provide more room in the em for tall accents and descenders? Or is there some technical
  reason for having a shorter cap height for text faces?

    But also, yes, text fonts need particularly tame caps.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Sorry, the term \u201Ccap height\u201D was a poor choice of words on my part.
    What I meant is that serif fonts tend to be drawn smaller within the em than sans
    fonts\u2014thus the shorter cap height. For example, many foundries that draw
    sans type with a cap height of around 700 units draw their serif type with a cap
    height of around 660 units. I can think of a variety of proportional and traditional
    reasons for this, but what I\u2019m really asking is if there\u2019s an important
    technical concern or if it\u2019s just a habit."

  body: "Probably because of the recommendation (from Microsoft, as far as I remember),
    that ascender + descender shall be less or equal to the UPM size on the one side
    and the want of the designer to make them as great as possible within the boundaries
    of the recommendation on the other side. But as far as I know, the specifications
    don\u2019t say, that it is a duty not to exceed the boundaries of the UPM. It
    is more a rumor, which is particulary caused by the (wrong) FontLab error message.\r\n\r\nEdited
    \u2013 from the <strong><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm#tad\">Recommendations
    for OpenType fonts:</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<cite>sTypoAscender, sTypoDescender and
    sTypoLineGap</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>sTypoAscender is used to determine the optimum
    offset from the top of a text frame to the first baseline. sTypoDescender is used
    to determine the optimum offset from the last baseline to the bottom of the text
    frame. The value of (sTypoAscender - sTypoDescender) is recommended to equal one
    em.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhile UPM means units per em.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think, that
    a sum of descender and ascender, that is greater than 1000 units, violates the
    specification. Especially because descender and ascender are not necessarily identically
    with the boundaries of the font boundaries box. But if you absolutely don\u2019t
    follow the recommendation, it is harder to combine different typefaces. But the
    advantage of greater sizes is, that you can control the outlines with more precision."

    then those of another face with cap ht ascenders."

  body: Another reason might be the intended use. Significantly smaller capitals than
    ascenders are more noticable at large sizes, where sans serifs still hold the
    biggest market share.

    with angled terminals is quite fuzzy.\r\nI checked my own output, and a greater
    percentage of the sans faces have taller ascenders.\r\nI don't have any standard
    practice for determining cap height in the em, or whether a face should have cap-height
    ascenders."
