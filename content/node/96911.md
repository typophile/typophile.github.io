  an easy one, but I can only find similar matches, like Chalet Comprime, Knockout,
  Akzidenz Grotesk etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_5991.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  picture is taken from [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/A-Grotesk-Love-Affair/1339317|this
  project]] on the Behance Network, you can find more samples there. I tried to message
  the creator but no reply so far.\r\nAny help really appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance,\r\nFederico"
