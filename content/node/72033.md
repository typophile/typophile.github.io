  AGaramond font for example.\r\nAfter that, exported to .otf Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nThe
  font it is ok in Freehand MX on 10.6 display correct, printing ok that special characters.\r\nIn
  Mac OS 10.4.11 same font, same file, same application, change the style, printing
  issues, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between 10.4 and 10.6 in this case?\r\nOr
  how should i export a font to work normal in Freehand MX, display and printing correct.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your patience,\r\n\r\nEdmond"
