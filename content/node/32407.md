  that the \"we deliver\" is Arial bold (shrunk vertically; tracking added), and \"more\"
  is Arial black (false italic; shrunk vertically; tracking added).\r\n\r\nBut I'm
  unsure of what \"GPS industries\" is. The extension of the \"G\" is really throwing
  me off. any suggestions?"

  body: "The type on the bottom looks more like Helvetica to me (also stretched),
    but I guess it could be Arial.\r\n\r\nThe type on the top looks like Trade Gothic
    Bold Condensed, extended a tiny bit."
