  very broken-looking site containing downloads of public domain traffic signage fonts.
  They all appear to be so, except one download that I'm not sure about, [[http://automatsvet.cz/traffic/de.zip|this
  German one]], which contains DIN 1451. Here's a [[http://imgur.com/Qfbs3.png|sample
  image]], metrically kerned. So, is this a commercial version of DIN 1451? Thanks!\r\n\r\n(I
  didn't know if I should plop this here, in Release, or in General. Sorry if this
  isn't the right one.)"

  body: Yup. Though the site says it's a public domain version, to me, it looks suspiciously
    professional, so I wanted to know if I'm using illegally uploaded commercial fonts.
    Do you suspect this to be the case?

  body: "Basically the design of DIN is public domain whereas specific digitizations
    may not be. Judging from the sample image this could be a custom digitization.
    The Engschrift doesn\u2019t look all that good.\r\nI don\u2019t think this is
    a commercial version. I could be wrong."

  body: Of note, four of the six fonts (all but Alte Din) offered in the above download
    are lacking the "name" table.
