  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am currently working on a new businesscard and envelope.  All criticism is much appreciated.</p>
<p>The businesscard was created by pattern cutting tools l purchased at a secondhand shop, using them as a cheap alternative to die cutting.  The front has a braile type texture created by piercing from behind[jpeg3]</p>
<p>My envelope is based on WW2 Dazzle patterns, with the inside incorporating a font l created.  The font was developed from patterns found inside envelopes and pay slips, designed to hide/distort content.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, if this is meant to be a set, I don&rsquo;t see much relationship between the envelope and the business card. So I will look at them separately, then.</p>
<p>That said, I LOVE the technique on the card! A tad bit time consuming to do by hand, though. Would be very cool to do a laser die-cit, but I understand cost restraints. (I&rsquo;m guessing this is a personal self-promotion item?) The kerning on the smaller white type seems awfully tight, but that might just be because I can&rsquo;t see it up close.</p>
<p>The envelope also is quite dynamic in a very different way than the card. While the card is subtle, the envelope is energetic. Nice added touch to have a message on the inside&hellip; BUT usually when you open a piece of mail, don&rsquo;t you run a blade through the edge? The recipient might never see your message, as they wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily open the flap that way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is meant to be a set, hopefully my letterhead and compliment slip will bring everything together, if not l may have to re-work the card or envelope.  I have a very tight budget, so die cutting is out of the question.</p>
<p>I was initially stuck on the concept for my card, and after experimenting with my new found tools l created the card.  What l liked about it was the subtlety, with my name being somewhat concealed/hidden.  I have attempted to carry the idea of &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; through to the envelope design, using a variant on a camoflage pattern[Royal Navy colour pantones].  But this has the opposite effect in the context of an envelope, making it standout.</p>
<p>The disruptive typeface may not be seen.  Most people l have asked tear open their envelopes, but l run the risk of my greeting meassage being missed.</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the concept of &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; (while it applies to the design of both objects) needs to be more obviously connected between the two.</p>
<p>I would be intrigued by a similar use of the hole-punching on the envelope. Perhaps just a small monogram of your initials in the return address area (matching the style of the card) that shows a hint of dark paper inside a light envelope (or vice versa&hellip; dark envelope &ndash; like the card &ndash; showing a light letterhead through).</p>
<p>Just a thought. I&rsquo;m all for matchy-matchy sets when it comes to stationery systems. Maybe that&rsquo;s a bit boring to you, but I find it strengthens the impact of the concept if everything is closely unified.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michael, I had thought of that advice also, but noticed that Alex (&lsquo;dole scum&rsquo;) is in the UK and the envelope was addressed for Italy. I have no knowledge of British or European mail standards, so I didn&rsquo;t comment on that aspect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always good advice to check with the local postal service when designing mail, especially for business use.</p>
<p>(Though, in reality, my experience with the USPS has been <strong>fabulous</strong> when it comes to delivering unique &lsquo;mail art&rsquo; that doesn&rsquo;t conform to standards, even internationally. This is <em>not</em> the same for bulk business mail though, where the rules are much stricter.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the link to the site.  The envelope guidelines seem very restrictive, but l have seen mail art in the LA based Arkitip magazine, so l assume they are leanient to some extent.  The envelope will be mainly used in the UK, so l cannot see any problems as any stamp marks are situated at the top of the envelope.</p>
<p>I also like coherent stationary, l will have to look at my work afresh tomorrow evening and see what l think.  Thanks for the advice,
l am now off down the pub for a pint of guiness, yumyum.</p>
