  I've learned here. Ergo...\r\n\r\nI'm working on a font that requires contextual
  alternates for certain characters (A, H, I, M, N, T, X and any accented characters
  associated with same) preceding EVERY instance of S, X, Z, s, x and z. I'm not sure
  what the easiest way to accomplish this is, and how to avoid recursive problems
  with X.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

  body: "Make three classes, for example\r\n\r\n@pre = [A H I M N T X]; # the glyphs
    you want to substitute out\r\n@post = [A.alt H.alt I.alt M.alt N.alt T.alt X.alt];
    # the glyphs you want to substitute in go here\r\n@context = [S X Z s x z]; #
    the glyphs that trigger your substitution go here\r\n\r\nThen in your Contextual
    Alternates (calt) feature use the following code\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\n   sub
    @pre' @context by @post;\r\n} calt;"

  body: you're quite welcome. This may not be all the code you need, but it provides
    the most basic functionality for what you were asking about.
