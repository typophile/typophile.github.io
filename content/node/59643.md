  I know so far:\r\n\r\n- The sample was printed before 1942;\r\nand probably after
  1929 (if typeface 1 is actually Memphis; see below)\r\n\r\n- typeface 1 looks like
  Memphis (Stempel, 1929), except the f is lacking the left side of the bar and the
  top of the t is cut off in an angle instead of horizontal.\r\n\r\n- typeface 2 has
  some features that can be found in typefaces mainly between 1900 and 1925 (style
  of the caps, small g-slope, top of t, oval dots on i, \xE4, \xFC etc.)\r\npretty
  close are Alt-Mediaeval (Berthold, 1914), Tiemann-Antiqua (Walter Tiemann, 1923,
  Gebr. Klingspor), or Bernhard-Antiqua (Lucian Bernhard, 1911, Flinsch).\r\n\r\n-
  typeface 3 (italic) has a remarkable g. couldn't find this anywhere...\r\n\r\n-
  typeface 4 is probably the most difficult one, the style of the caps (esp. E, M,
  R) might be helpful. For complete confusion there are two different W's!\r\n\r\nthanks
  for any advice...!\r\noliver\r\n"
