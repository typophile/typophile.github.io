  body: "I usually find that it's easier to distinguish URLs when they're <em>set
    in italic</em> (assuming you're using a typeface with a readable italic). When
    the URL is too long for one line, I try to break at a slash (virgule), and for
    absolute clarity I sometimes bring the slash down to the next line; that way it's
    absolutely clear that this is just a line break within a URL. No hyphens, since
    there may be hard hyphens in the address itself.\r\n\r\nAnd I never include the
    \"http://\" prefix, which is redundant in print. \r\n\r\nIt's probably better
    to pull long URLs out of running text altogether, if you can, and set them as
    separate elements on the page.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>p.s. and remember, there _are_ shortening services!</cite>\r\n\r\nBut
    one can't be sure how long the databases of those URL shorteners are maintained,
    nor of the stability of the companies that operate them. Besides, some of them
    have intrusive features or restrict the nature of the sites you link with them.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"http://\" prefix helps me to identify a URL in print when the domain is a relatively
    unfamiliar brand and isn't preceded by \"www.\" or followed by the usual \".com\",
    etc. However, it really annoys me to hear it read out loud on the radio, especially
    when the announcer says \"forward-slash\"."

    consider using footnotes. Put the full URL in the foot note. And, as bowerbird
    suggested, it'd be great if there were also a short-url option as well to facilitate
    typing. "
