  body: It seems like lettering to me. The repeated letters (A, T) are not exactly
    the same.

  body: I've seen this poster locally. What is it for? Some CD compilation I think.
    I'd love to know who did it and whether this bit is actually an old engraving
    or they managed to do a really good engraving effect.

  body: "Looks like a customized [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/archivetype/archive-steeler/|Archive
    Steeler]] to me.\r\n\r\nThis is the cover of a CD compilation. It looks to be
    designed by Funny Garbage and Ryan Feerer. It also says that the background art
    and illustrations were taken from Gustave Dore's illustrated version of Paradise
    Lost. Dore's illustrations are detailed engravings, so my guess is that all of
    the engraving textures are taken from that.\r\n\r\nVery lovely cover, in my opinion."
