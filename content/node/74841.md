body: Hi, wise people. Although I have many fonts, just now I am working hard to learn
  technical knowledge needed. Therefore, Python is one thing I would like to know,
  since two years ago. However, the last two times I tried to install it on my PC,
  I could not. So why is it important for the job? What are the first steps to work
  with it, including your installation?

    know about Python for it to be useful. The basics -- loops, conditional statements,
    simple string operations -- combined with FontLab- or RoboFab-specific functions
    and data objects, will go a long way. I highly recommend RoboFab since it makes
    using Python in FontLab easier. This page is a good place to start: http://www.robofab.org/talks09/index.html'

    but combined with FontForge's Python interface turned to be an integral part of
    my font development work flow, I can hardly do any font now without a bunch of
    Python scripts.

    to get! RoboFab seems have only Mac versions, and I work with Windows 7. But I
    did install (aparently) the 3.1.2 Python version (self-installer). \r\n\r\nAfter
    this I did add some python library files like NuggedMacros, accentTools, FeatureProof
    (this I did not try install), all downloaded from the pages which you indicates)
    to my macro folder at FontLab folder. But the 'Macro\" tool at FontLab never shows
    nothing. Is not activated.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, Richard, we need a lot of time to learn
    this stuff. My case is worst, because sometimes the language barrel is a problem,
    I speak portuguese, and my english is limited because I am a self-taugth english
    speaker."

  body: I am not sure I understand the value of Python in designing type fonts. Scripting
    is fine I suppose for some things, but people have designed fonts for years without
    Python so why use it? Can you show me an example of how it might make things simple
    or simpler? I have a new IMAC with OS 10.6.4 which apparently already has Python
    installed. What am I missing here?

  body: "When I say it makes things simpler, I mean things that would be tedious or
    time-consuming to do otherwise, like renaming hundreds of glyphs.\r\n\r\nHere
    are a few things that I've used Python and RoboFab for in FontLab:\r\n- Renaming
    glyphs (especially when there are many)\r\n- Automatically placing anchors in
    preparation for adding accents\r\n- Manipulating composites in various ways\r\n-
    Adding features and tools to FontLab (usually using scripts written by others)\r\n-
    Importing and exporting UFO files\r\n- Updating individual glyphs in external
    UFO files\r\n- Running the Adobe autohinter\r\n- Checking outlines and font integrity\r\n-
    Generating fonts quickly for testing\r\n- Manipulating masters in MM fonts\r\n-
    Clearing hundreds of random master guidelines that sometimes get added because
    of a certain FontLab bug (FontLab has no \"clear guidelines\" command)\r\n- Selecting
    a specific group of glyphs repeatedly (in different related fonts usually)\r\n-
    Doing simple interpolations between two glyphs\r\n- Manipulating outlines (adding
    bevels to corners, for example)\r\n\r\nSome of these I've done using scripts I've
    written myself, but most of the examples above I do with scripts written by others
    (some free, some paid for). \r\n\r\nFor doing single fonts with basic character
    sets, the advantages might not be apparent, but once you start doing multi-weight
    families with hundreds of glyphs, it can make a big difference.\r\n\r\nI remember
    a few years ago when I was working on some changes to Proxima Nova, a 42-font
    family. I don't remember exactly what I was doing to it (it was a few years ago),
    but I needed to do a long series of steps to each font. Working as fast as I could
    using just the built-in commands in FontLab, doing all these tedious steps, which
    affected dozens of glyphs in each font, and being careful not to make mistakes,
    I got it down to around half an hour for each font. Facing days of doing such
    a mind-numbing task, I was motivated to figure out a way to speed things up using
    Python scripting (which I had not done much before). I went through all the steps
    and identified where the bottlenecks were and which things could be accomplished
    using scripting. It took me less than a day to write the scripts I needed, reducing
    the time to make the changes to a few minutes for each font. I remember that one
    step went from about a 15 minutes down to a few seconds. It literally saved me
    days worth of work, and I'm sure I couldn't have done it as accurately manually.
    And I would have been bored out of my mind.\r\n\r\nSo, sure, it's possible to
    design fonts without using scripting, but when such a powerful lever is handed
    to you and the only cost is to take some time to learn how to use it, why not
    take advantage of it?"

  body: "Mark, first, thanks for the patience to help us with this accurate explanation
    (I think its stolen a time from your time). \r\n\r\nI will pick up the mostly
    important things which I think can help at my job, mainly:\r\n\r\n- Renaming glyphs
    (especially when there are many) - In future, when I begin to create text fonts,
    for while I make only display\r\n\r\n- Automatically placing anchors in preparation
    for adding accents, GOOD\r\n- Manipulating composites in various ways, GOOD\r\n-
    Adding features and tools to FontLab (usually using scripts written by others),
    GOOD\r\n- Running the Adobe autohinter, SEEMS GOOD, but what is \"Adobe autohinter\"
    ?\r\n- Checking outlines and font integrity, GOOD\r\n- Clearing hundreds of random
    master guidelines that sometimes get added because of a certain FontLab bug (FontLab
    has no \"clear guidelines\" command) - I dont remember to see this kind of bug
    into here\r\n- Doing simple interpolations between two glyphs, GOOD\r\n- Manipulating
    outlines (adding bevels to corners, for example), GOOD\r\n\r\n\"So, sure, it's
    possible to design fonts without using scripting, but when such a powerful lever
    is handed to you and the only cost is to take some time to learn how to use it,
    why not take advantage of it?\"\r\n\r\nI think which the main question here is,
    in fact, a philosophical question: since Gutenberg, the technics to make fonts
    never stop to up. New tools was added along the centurys. So, we need, to exist
    like typographers, learn ever, or die. \r\n\r\nBut, is not possible which, in
    some years, these complicated tools of Python programing be added like easy human
    interfaces at FontLab? Like single buttons and panels self-instructives for dummies
    (like me sometimes)?\r\n\r\nI will lear RoboFab and Python because my next natural
    step will be make accurate text fonts. But, I have fear which when I finish the
    lesson, someone has added single tools like all here listed in easy buttons at
    FontLab.\r\n\r\nA last question: many of these resources, principally those which
    helps with extensive font projects seems good to high legible text fonts. You
    think which is good to script fonts? I request this because my actual works runs
    around a lot of script fonts\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "In the links below are some examples of what others have done to extend the
    features of FontLab, showing that using Python need not be complicated. Each of
    these was designed so that it looks and works like other features in FontLab,
    much the way plug-ins work in some programs. (Note: These are both commercial
    projects, but have free demo versions.) These are videos from the RoboFab conference
    back in early 2009.\r\n\r\n\"Remix Tools\": http://letterror.blip.tv/file/1911354/\r\n(

    beginning of these that you can't skip, but they are short.)\r\n\r\nThe Adobe
    autohinter is superior to FontLab's built-in autohinting. It's the tool that Adobe
    uses for all their fonts, and they provide it free along with their AFDKO (Adobe
    Font Development Kit for OpenType). It can be run from the command line on your
    computer, or from within FontLab by running a special Python script. ( http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html

    more than others from the use of scripting, but all can benefit some."
