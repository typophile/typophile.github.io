body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nwe would like to introduce you Show, a multi-layered chromatic font
  family based on an old Victorian style wood type. http://show.juanjez.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow
  designers In\xE9s Atienza and Juanjo L\xF3pez are members of the Familia Pl\xF3mez
  association, a small printshop based in Madrid that devote their efforts to promote
  everything about letterpress printing, calligraphy, and lettering. One of our favorite
  typefaces from our collection of wood types has been the basis for creating a new
  digital typeface.\r\n\r\nChromatic type is printed from multiple pieces of type,
  each with a different ink; each color is the result of the sheet of paper making
  a separate pass through the press. These chromatic types were designed to register
  as much as possible, repeating only a part of the design and allowing the user to
  even create colors by mixing superimposed parts.\r\n\r\nShow has an extended character
  set to support Central & Eastern European as well as Western European languages.
  It includes monetary symbols and complete punctuation. As the original font lacked
  a lowercase, we have replaced them with small caps, which can be used either in
  conjunction with the caps or independently.\r\n\r\nShow has thirteen styles, and
  its price is 40 euros, but you can get a 50% discount in our website sharing on
  Twitter.\r\n\r\nAlso, we have done a letterpress run of 50 postcards for the first
  50 buyers using the original Concave combined with lead type.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your attention! \r\n\r\nhttp://show.juanjez.com/\r\nhttp://www.juanjez.com[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ampersand_3727.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Show_7_6358.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/show4_5266.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Show_8_4797.jpg]"
