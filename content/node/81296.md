body: "I've been translating/editing a lot of articles recently, mostly about art
  history (some Renaissance, some 19th century art). I'll also be working on a webjournal/academic
  journal for my art history department soon.\r\n\r\nFor articles I've been using
  Latex because I find it simpler to type along, but of course I'll consider using
  InDesign for the journal (or whatever they have available at the university, but
  I'm afraid I'll have work with opensource/free software, or else with my personal
  computer).\r\n\r\nAfter fiddling with fonts, I have decided to go with Kepler, perhaps
  with Sanvito for titles/sections/title pages.\r\n\r\nI'm no professional typesetter,
  but since I'm going to be working with publishing, I decidedly want something decent,
  not html/word formatting done by someone who lacks any awareness of type.\r\n\r\nSo,
  do the examples attached look \"decent\" enough? (In terms of type choice, margins,
  figure placement, etc.)\r\n\r\nAny comments would be much appreciated."

    could add some leading (space between the lines). This\u2019ll make it easier
    for the reader to find his place when he comes to the end of a line. Try reading
    a printout yourself!"

  body: "I agree that line lengths are too long. \r\nAlso, is there a reason for extending
    the image past the text margin on the inside? In addition to not aligning with
    the caption, that placement also makes me wonder if extending the image so near
    to the spine will make photocopying or scanning more difficult. (I'm an art historian
    and image placement that makes it impossible to sit that part of the page flat
    on a copier or scanner is a perennial frustration.)"

    the character number per line with Latex but it didn't work out as expected (some
    2-3 characters less, plus lots of empty upper and outer margin space).\r\n\r\nI
    decided to try out editing the whole thing in Word 2010 (took some time) to see
    how it would look like, and the result seemed very straightforward and acceptable
    -- althought I added space between paragraphs and used Myriad as a sans-serif.\r\n\r\n@eliason:
    I hadn't paid attention yet to how images would fit when printed or photocopied,
    but your observation makes sense. There must be an obvious difference between
    home-made printing and books/magazines I hadn't noticed -- I always see images
    extending beyond the text margin. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I made a new document just in
    case (I just hope I didn't screw it up and made it worse). You can find it [[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23970121/Da%20monera%20ao%20homem.pdf|here]]
    if you want to take a look.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot."

    you should also find a way to differentiate the captions \u2014 e.g. smaller size,

    to old style and captions to sans-serif -- should I apply sans-serif to old style
    figures, too?\r\n\r\nI also set paragraphs ragged right, without hyphenation,
    and with a space between paragaphs, single column, A4 paper (for class handout
    articles, for the journal I still have to find an appropriate size); margins 2,5
    cm top/bottom and 3,0cm left/right; sans-serif Myriad Pro Bold 14pt; serif Kepler
    11pt.\r\n\r\nAre there any other changes I should/could make (or perhaps reverse
    to the previous version)?"

    to have old style figures in your sans serif captions.\r\nBut it does make a difference
    to extended serif body copy.\r\n\r\n"

    English, the normal convention would be 1873\u201374 as an abbreviation for 1873\u20131874
    (en-dash, no spaces). I don't know what the standard practice is in Portuguese
    for numeric ranges. Both usage and spacing of punctuation vary a lot between countries."
