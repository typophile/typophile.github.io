  body: "Hi Serkan. Welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nYou will find you get better feedback
    if you provide a more detailed description of your context, and show a little
    of your own legwork first. For example, \r\n\r\nWhat school do you go to? What
    is the program? Can you provide a more detailed description other than than \u201C<em>typography
    relation with architecture</em>\u201D? What is your thesis statement? Where have
    you already looked? What have you found?\r\n\r\nAs it stands, it appears as though
    you are asking others to do your literature-review for you. Learning how to conduct
    a proper literature review is an important part of preparing a thesis."

    clear) which is one thing a place like this is clearly for.\r\n\r\nSerkan, this
    is one of the few books on the subject that makes sense:\r\nhttp://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=16501\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Many architects and designers associated to the \"Amsterdamse School\" movement
    had a keen interest in lettering and typography. The facades, bridges and objects
    designed by them were covered by interesting 'architect letters'. In \"Dutch Type\"
    by Jan Middendorp a couple of chapters explore this tradition.\r\nThere is also
    a book called \"Wendingen\" over the magazine this avant-garde published were
    you will find interesting examples of their letterings."
