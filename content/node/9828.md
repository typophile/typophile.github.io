  body: "Haha. How did I miss this thread?\r\n\r\nYes, it is [[DIN]] Mittelschrift,
    but I shortened the descent of the j since it was painfully awkward and lonely
    sticking out front. The client insisted on a lowercase j, which I didn't like
    at the time. But, since it's grown on me. The only reason I didn't use [[FF DIN]]
    was because we had the license to the [[Adobe]] version."
