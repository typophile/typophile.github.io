  Anyone have a better idea?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brighton_4670.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  help much appreciated, thank you."

    horizontal scale applied it throws 'WhatTheFont' way out of wack."

  body: "I did think it was Garamond, but it isn't - that's what's thrown me off.
    Note the terminal on the y, the shape of the ampersand, the whole shape of the
    capital c and the connections between the storeys on the g.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    it could be a tweaked version of Garamond, but they seem odd changes to make!
    Here's my comparison - apologies for huge image but to see the differences it
    helps:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/garamonds_6189.jpg]\r\n\r\n--\r\nAegir"

  body: Did you click on my link to 'ITC Garamond Bold' which matches the "y" terminal
    exactly?

    (which Jeff should have mentioned).\r\nThere are a lot of Garamonds that are quite
    different."

  body: "Sorry for forgetting to post 'ITC Garamond Bold' in my first post. That's
    what I get for copying the font name from MyFonts. :(\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks Aegir
    for posting that sample... you may have just helped solve another ID case involving
    Garamond that has really been bothering me."

  body: Interesting, it appears to be condensed to around 90%, which make it halfway
    between ITC Garamond and Apple Garamond (which was an ITC Garamond condensed to
    80%).
