body: So i&#39;ve gotten pretty good at setting type and modifying existing faces..
  i mean, i&#39;m at least confident in my skills up to where i&#39;m at, but i really
  feel like to push my skills i really need to explore hand lettering further.. can
  anyone recommend any books on hand lettering, sign painting, or calligraphy? i could
  use some jumping off points to do my own work, as well as some good reference material.
  <BR> <BR>ready to spend some money on amazon.com tonight! <BR> <BR>thanks in advance.
