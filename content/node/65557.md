  is in the midst of doing a thin magazine/booklet.\r\n\r\nI adore Australia's Frankie
  magazine and the body type they use,\r\nif I am not wrong it's EF DIN 1451 Mittel
  Alt?\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=403648  \r\n\r\nI'm hoping
  to get some advice on similar typeface,\r\nor something that is sans serif, rounded
  and looks friendly and not overly corporate.\r\n\r\nIt will be very helpful if it
  is... free type or doesn't burn too much from my measly allowance. Please advise!"

    more \"condensed\" though.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the help!\r\n"
