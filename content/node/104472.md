body: "Is there a name for the anatomical condition in a capital W, where the second
  and third diagonal intersect (crossover one another) rather than form a pointed
  apex?\r\n\r\n[[http://myfonts.us/td-xqRvmI|Garamond W]], for example.\r\n\r\nVs.
  [[http://myfonts.us/td-PKXnLg|Minion]], for example.\r\n\r\nAnd while I'm at it,
  what's [[http://myfonts.us/td-swl07E|this]] condition in Goudy catalogue called,
  where the second diagonal meets the third mid way up, creating a left-leaning terminal/apex?"

    is necessary for that category, because these are all the same idea, with varying
    amounts of overlap of the \u201CV\u201Ds:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ws_4066.png]\r\n"

  body: If, however, you wanted to define two categories on Nick's continuum, you
    could easily do so at the point when the upper counter between the Vs disappears.
    A different candidate for the distinction could be the place at which the two
    middle bilateral serifs conjoin and become one.
