body: "I love my sketchbook.\r\n\r\nHowever, it has taken shape to look like something
  natalie dee would create (see also: www.nataliedee.com).  I'm not sure if this is
  a good or a bad thing.  Of course, I think I am funny, but I think a good majority
  of my humor is lost on others.  I would love to collage, but the problem with collaging
  is actually finding things to put together.  I have these ideas of things I would
  like to see together, but of course, that is not the point of collaging.\r\n\r\nHow
  do I better my sketchbook and show concept development while still showing variety?
  What are your suggestions?"
