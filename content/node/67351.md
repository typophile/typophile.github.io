body: "After 26 hours I finally finished all the Latin capital letters. I still need
  to do some letters with diactrics, the Polish letters and several ligatures. After
  that I can finally start the undercast letters and then the rest...\r\n\r\nC\xE9lente
  is a narrow, modern yet elegant typeface particularly designed for the fashion industry,
  though it can be used for virtually anything including book text. I wanted to design
  a narrow serif typeface with very small serifs - almost like a humanist sans-serif.
  Eventually the serifs became a bit larger, but still smaller than usual. I would
  like your opinions and possibly suggestions.\r\n\r\nI will make the Z a bit more
  narrow, the S a bit more wide, and possibly the O and Q a tiny bit more narrow as
  well."

  body: It reminds me of a rough version of Trajan. Doesn't necessarily seem like
    something I've seen used in fashion. Fashion tends to be more in the realm of
    Didoni or Memoriam, a bit more contrasty I think.

  body: "It doesn't look like Trajan at all. I guess you're making that association
    because you're only seeing capital letters and they have a large x-height.\r\n\r\nI've
    never seen Memoriam in use, actually. I frequently buy fashion magazines and keep
    track of several major fashion labels, and Didot, Bodoni and Avant Garde Gothic
    are used extensively in fashion. So you're right; fashion does make use of typefaces
    with a high contrast. This regular C\xE9lente will be useful for book text and
    headings. C\xE9lente light will have a higher contrast.\r\n\r\nOn an other note,
    I made the presentation at work today on a Mac. Now I look at it at home on a
    PC. it looks horrible. I might replace it with a more appropriate presentation,
    though I guess the typeface is up so that's what counts."

  body: "It is quite a bit like a more rigid Trajan. The swash-like tail of the Q
    and similar strokes on the R, K, and J especially. It's interesting though, that
    while some of the aspects are more formal looking than Trajan (the straighter
    lines, the more consistent character width and serif size), others are more whimsical,
    like the S, C, and the alternate, rounded G. Meanwhile, Trajan breaks from rigidity
    on characters that Celente leaves formal, like the M, N, and P.\r\n\r\nI think
    the short, blunt serifs work well for it, especially as a body font. It still
    retains its elegance and class, too. The thing is, if it is going to be a body
    font, it might be best to tone down the swash-like strokes in favor of something
    more consistent and reserved. On the other hand, if it is something that is to
    be used in titling, maybe those whimsical aspects of the font should be played
    up, and you should make the widths more varied. (Leave the Z, O and Q wide and
    adjust some others to break the box as well).\r\n\r\nOn that note, for a whimsical
    title font, the S is great. It has a sense of dimensionality.\r\n\r\nAnyway, those
    are my thoughts about it. Good luck finishing it."

  body: Thanks a lot for your opinion. There will actually be a book version (as shown)
    and a regular version which will have a higher contrast. When I finally finish
    the whole family I will continue with a sans-serif version and a version with
    extended serifs. I took the serifs off and the result is a beautiful narrow humanist
    sans-serif.
