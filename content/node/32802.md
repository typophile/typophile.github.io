  germany, and was wondering \r\nif anyone could recommend any online visual references?
  The piece was \r\nentitled 'Football behind the Iron Curtain' so I immediately thought
  of having\r\na look at constructivism, but it turns out to be exclusively about
  germany \r\nso this seems a bit misguided.\r\n\r\nAny help and historical enlightenment
  would be greatly appreciated, \r\n\r\nG"

  body: "I would recommend against constructivism. That is more a style from the 1920s,
    and is aligned with 1920s art and design in Holland, Germany, and the Soviet Union.
    I don't see how it has much influence on post-war design or on football!\r\n\r\nActually,
    something \"bland\" like Helvetica or Univers might be the most appropriate here.\r\n\r\nOn
    <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu\xDFball-Weltmeisterschaft_1974\">this
    page</a>, you can see the logo from the 1974 World Cup. This was hosted (and won!)
    by West Germany, although the East German team beat them in the preliminary round."

    me. \r\nAm constrained to the mag body face which is DIN, but love the logo. I've
    also used this;[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DDR_4648.png]\r\nwhich I understand
    to be the emblem for the DDR. Is this correct or have I got confused? Was it used
    in conjunction with the football team?\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,\r\n\r\nG"

  body: "I'm sort of allergic to the DDR, but that looks like their emblem to me.
    I have no idea what their national team graphics or design looked like, but it
    probably changed several times over the decades, just like West Germany's did
    (just compare the three jerseys that the West German team wore during each of
    their three World Cup victories in 1954, 1974, and 1990).\r\n\r\nDIN isn't such
    a bad choice, it is German, and was used during the cold war on West German highway
    signs (it is still on all German highway signs today, of course). I believe that
    it was drawn during the 1930s, but I don't really know exactly. I also have no
    idea what sort of highway signage the East Germans had.\r\n\r\n\u2026and there
    is no need to call me Mr.!"
