  for a while now. \r\nI know it's another sans and that doesn't go down too well,
  but I've come this far and I wanted to try and get it finished, so any advise or
  crit would be greatly appreicated.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Regard to the Regular, the horizontal bar of 'A' looks too low to me, 'C'
    'G' little bit too wide, I`d drag the right points of the leg of 'R' some units
    to the right (nice 'k'). I would avoid 'T' 'W' oblique part, same for bottom right
    'Z', '7' and lc '2'. The descender od 'q' could be little bit longer if you cut
    it that way, or match 'p'/'q' - same for 'b'/'d'. The looping for '8' seems interrupted,
    '5' '7' too thin in the horizontal parts. '$' is wrong, '\u20AC' is wrong, vertical
    bar of '\xA2' too thin. 'C,R' in '\xAE,\xA9' need to be bolder and your design.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"

    in people opinions on the spacing, I keep changing my mind on it being to loose
    or too tight.\r\n\r\nS.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Overall I really like the way you've drawn your Depot. I'd have some crit
    for some glyph, but it's personal and you've the final answer.\r\nM and W: middle
    join seem too short to me)\r\nh, n m: the join between the stems and the curve
    seems to low compare to the p, b, d and q\r\nr: the join of the curve and the
    stem is not smooth.\r\n\r\nThe left sidebearing of some letters have to be review:
    u r b(see words \xABcurve\xBB or \xABbut\xBB for instance).\r\nGood work\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    especially in the light version. '
