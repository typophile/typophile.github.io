  It shares the grid structure of faces such as Trajan and I have been told it is
  a clean, modern take on faces such as optima. I have had some trouble finding information
  on faces like it. Could anyone point me to a source of information on others like
  it? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m producing a specimen book for a school project and need to
  explain my typeface. I think my problem here is that The only references I used
  were trajan and optima for informing me on proportions. <BR> <BR>Thankyou. <BR>
  <BR>My poster is attached. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: KS_poster-52985.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*34.7**KS_poster%2epdf

  body: Nice work, Christopher. <BR> <BR>Without a lower case it&#39;s difficult to
    be precise, but I&#39;d call it a <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=humanist+sans?refby=typographica"
    target="_blank">humanist sans</a> as it&#39;s certainly not a geometric or grotesque.

  body: If you were to have a lowercase, btw, I think <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=SG.102126.0.5&amp;charSize=14&amp;sampleText=ABCDEHKLRM&amp;sampleSize=48"
    target="_blank">Today Sans</a>  <BR>or Mario Feliciano&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/feliciano/stella/"
    target="_blank">Stella</a> would serve as good models.

  body: Christopher - That&#39;s VERY good for a novice. it just needs the odd tweak
    here and there. <BR> <BR>You say you are at SCHOOL? - incredible! - it&#39;s so
    professional. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say your future&#39;s in type design. <BR> <BR>Well
    done.
