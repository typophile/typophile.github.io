  body: When I was a child, my mother had a part-time job as accountant for a small
    printer. Sometimes she would bring me with her. I still remember the noise of
    the machines and the aroma of ink.

    is broad enough to span neuropsychology (I have colleagues who use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging\">fMRI</a>
    technology to monitor changes in brain activity as a result of various forms of
    typographic manipulation such as size and colour), to the art of calligraphy.\r\n"

    I'd be if a girl at a bar started to talk to me about discretionary ligature..\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    really started getting into typography during an intro design course. It was during
    this quiz on the \"anatomy\" of letterforms and it was through that lesson that
    I started to understand the system of forms and fell in love with the range of
    voices and emotions different letterforms and typefaces had. \r\n\r\nAnd I've
    been in love since"

  body: Yes I do remember. When I was working at an Ad Agency in Istanbul. I once
    even forgot to convert the fonts and sent a full page fashion advert without the
    fonts to a Turkish national newspaper. It was a broadsheet newspaper and printed
    "thousands" with good old Courier. The account manager and I had tough times then
    but I remember the client not noticing it. Otherwise it would have been the perfect
    reason to be "fired" :-)

  body: Never mind just getting Courier, I recall in the late '80s when it took 40
    minutes to print a page on my $4,000 300dpi LaserWriter (that's the second-hand
    price BTW), so if I had a 12-page job to present the next day, I'd leave it printing
    overnight and hope to hell I didn't get a PostScript error on page 2 which killed
    the whole process dead in its tracks.
