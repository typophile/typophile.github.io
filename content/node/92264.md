  other options out there that may be better.   The font I like for this particular
  project is Kristen ITC (http://www.azfonts.net/load_font/itckris0.html).  However
  for the \"k\" character I specifically need it to have a flat hump and then branch
  upwards.  The only font I found that is like this is Planet Estyle (http://www.dafont.com/planet-estyle.font)\r\n\r\nOther
  than just taking the \"k\" from the one font and joining it to the other, does anybody
  know of any other fonts that could potentially work for this?  This is my first
  post here so I'm not sure what other information is needed - just let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    at MyFonts/FontShop/whatever, and look at the full character showing."

    a similar construction. And unfortunately, if you need the lowercase k, Nick\u2019s
    clever suggestion wouldn\u2019t work (Cyrillic \u043A lacks an ascender).\r\nIf
    using a different style of font isn\u2019t a problem, there are more possibilities.
    What\u2019s the project about?"
