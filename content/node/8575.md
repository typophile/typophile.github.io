  body: This is an Alphabet Innovations font from the early &#39;70s by Phil Martin
    called Fat Chance. I don&#39;t know of any digital version. <BR> <BR>You could

  body: 'There&#39;s a typeface in the Solotype Catalog called Rolling Extra Bold,
    which Dieter Steffmann digitized as <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/r/rolling.htm"
    target="_blank"> Rolling No One ExtraBold</a>. As you can see, it&#39;s less rounded,
    but pretty close: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/62686.gif"
