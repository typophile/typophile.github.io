  through T1 hinting, when I generate an Open Type font the hinting goes together?

  body: Fernando,  <BR> <BR>you haven&#39;t mentioned any tools that you are using,
    or the operating system you use. This makes it a bit difficult to answer your
    question.  <BR> <BR>My guess is that you&#39;re working with FontLab 4.6.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, you haven&#39;t mentioned the format that you&#39;re generating your
    OpenType font in -- whether it&#39;s OpenType PS aka OpenType-CFF &#40;.otf&#41;
    or it&#39;s OpenType TT/TrueType &#40;.ttf&#41;.  <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re using
    FontLab to generate an OpenType PS font, the Type 1 hinting is automatically converted
    to CFF hinting. Both hinting systems are very similar, and the conversion is done
    by Adobe&#39;s high-quality FDK for OpenType code that is built into FontLab.  <BR>
    <BR>If you&#39;re using FontLab to generate an OpenType TT font, the Type 1 hinting
    is coverted into TrueType hinting instructions. This is a process done by a very
    advanced TrueType autohinting system developed by the FontLab team. You can control
    how this conversion is done using Preferences / TrueType / Autohinting Options.
    You can also do the conversion manually, by using the various actions from Tools
    / Transform Range.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.
