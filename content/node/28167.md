body: "today being the day that it is, much of my thoughts today revolve around those
  events. i was looking at wtc.com just earlier, at the future plans for the WTC site,
  and i'm just loving the sans typeface they're using in the logo and menus.. it looks
  kinda like Eagle, but not really either looking at it in bigger size. and now that
  i get here to Typophile, it strikes me that it looks very similar to the font used
  here on Typophile too, also in the logo and the top menu. can't say if it's the
  exact same one, but maybe? the identity to both (if different) would be very welcome.
  here's a bigger sample of it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtc_5706.png]"

    etc. It's used on the headstone - whatever you call it - of the Freedom Tower
    (if it ever gets built).
