  box in the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel and on a contemporary poster for a beer
  festival. Images attached.\r\n\r\n(This post is a bit duplicative, but the Typophile
  comment system gave me an error message every time I tried to include new images
  in a comment.)\r\n\r\n(In case anyone is curious, \u201CMendl\u2019s\u201D on the
  Mendl\u2019s box is almost certainly hand lettered, and \u201CBrucknerplatz No.
  12\u201D is either Modern 735 or Bodoni Campanile, which appear to be identical.)\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks."

    a bigger, clearer sample helps tremendously, but I am a bit disappointed that
    the \"hand-drawn\" claim I cited in an earlier post seems to have been a half-truth
    on the part of the movie's production designer (hand-drawn, just not by her or
    her staff).\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/118355"

    is there a plain version, perhaps with no shadow, that is not distressed?\r\nDon"
