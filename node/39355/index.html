<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>hey everyone,
Well, i took a shot at making a typeface. I am still working on it, specifically the numbers. I don't know if anyone on here skateboards, but the typeface is sort of inspired by a skateboard company called Krooked. Tell me what you think.
Also, this typeface so far has been made entirely in Illustrator, and i have no idea how to turn it into an actual font. Does anyone have any links or info i could read up on how to combine my characters in Illustrator into a font?
thanks!
josh

<div class=commentbody>Hi josh!
I like your design (even though this has been explored before):
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/potato-cut/potato-cut/
Some characters are thicker than others. C M N T U V A
So in addition to evening the typographic color continue to refine your numerals. Then you'll have something really groovy.
All my best you,
Mike Diaz :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>thanks for the critique Mike.
Man, i swear i didn't look at that potato-cut typeface. I originally created about a third of the letters for a skateboard deck graphic, and decided that i might as well finish out the rest and turn it into a typeface.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Josh I know you didn't copy. Typophilers can tell if a font has been derived from another font and for sure its not the case with you.
I just mentioned Potato Cut because if you plan on selling the font one day to the public or to a client you have to be aware of the possibility there maybe competing designs. That means you have to be extra special. Just looking out for you.

<div class=commentbody>The 'C' seems out of place to me. I'd either square it up, or add some more curves to other letters.
Is the 'W' just a flipped 'M'? Maybe modify it so it doesn't look like it is.

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, i see what you mean Mikey.
I was feeling the same way about the 'C' Lex, i am gonna square it up more to fit with the other letters, and also modify the W and M so they aren't so similar.
I was wondering if anyone has any comment on the numbers. Do you think they look better a little bit more rounded like the 1-6 or blocky like the 8 and 9?

<div class=commentbody>Hi again:
If the alphabetics are rough and square then the numerals should be that way too.
Or if you want to be smoother in the numerals you should bring that to the letters because it create harmony.
Users will mix letters and numbers together in the same world so all these characters have to jive together.
Mikey :-)

Hi. You need to get a font creation program (<a href=http://www.fontlab.com/>Fontographer and FontLab</a> are two, but there are others) and bring your Illustrator drawings into it. Check out the <a href=http://typophile.com/node/12369?>How-To</a> section of the TypoWiki for more info on the practical aspects. Check out the <a href=http://typophile.com/node/12157?>Books</a> section to find literature on the subject of designing or creating a typeface. Also, a Google search will probably get you some online tutorials on the basics.</div>

<div class=commentbody>okay cool. I have fontlab, but i wassn't sure if it was possible to import characters from illustrator into Fontlab. I will try to search google some, and check out the links you gave. Thanks!
Any other comments on my typeface?</div>

The J and the L also have a bit of that problem. They are clearly not flipped but yet appear rather too similar. Maybe the J could be re-thought.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Crap, this is hard. I am having trouble getting my illustrator characters to copy and paste or import into Fontlab. Does anyone else have any other methods, maybe outside of Fontlab to turn my characters into a typeface this time?
thanks!
