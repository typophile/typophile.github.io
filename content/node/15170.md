  body: "Font management in OS X has been a real sore spot for me and mt small creative
    studio. I have tried every solution out there, with limited success. I discovered
    and installed FontExplorer X yesterday morning. What a find! It is feature-packed,
    stable --and WORKS!\r\n\r\nI have noticed one problem, and I have emailed Linotype
    regarding this. I'm wondering if there is a cap on the number of fonts that can
    reside in the FontExplorer X library? My Library indicates 7742 font files and
    I'm seeing some Suitcase-like behavior (gasp!) from some of my imported sets.
    In the Preview pane I'm seeing a lot of \"Not Available\" messages being displayed.
    Interestingly enough, the frequency of these messages INCREASES as I view sets
    that have been added most recently. All of my fonts are organized by foundry,
    alphabetically, and were added to FontExplorer in order (Adobe, Bitstream, Emigre,
    FontFont, Linotype, etc). The LAST set, named Various, shows ALL of the fonts
    as \"Not Avaialble.\" The next set up, URW, shows MOST of them as being unavailable.
    This continues up the sets list until about midway. This leads me to believe that
    FontExplorer, at some point, has become unable to store any more font previews.\r\n\r\nI
    am assuming that it does indeed STORE previews rather than generating them on
    the fly; I can't think of any other reason why it would be unable to show previews
    with such a pattern. Removing the last several sets, then re-importing one of
    the problem sets results in most of the previously \"Not Available\" previews
    in the set previewing just fine, which seems to support this assumption. From
    what I can determine, this behavior begins to become prevelant at around the 4500
    to 5000 font file mark.\r\n\r\nCan anyone else with a large Library confirm this
    behavior?"

  body: The font thing really sucks compared to FEX. However, FEX isn't currently
    available for Windows. One big disadvantage of TheFontThing is that you can't
    preview anything other that TTF fonts. I suspect FEX will do much better in this
    regard.
