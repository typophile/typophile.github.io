  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am not a type designer but I work with fonts almost every day. I help several type designers to build accented characters, class kerning and OT features. During the last four years I&rsquo;ve came up with dozens of font families from different designers. Every type foundry has its own glyph naming scheme and different suffices.</p>
<p>There are many type designers from many type foundries here on Typophile. I think we should together make a well prepared <strong>glyph naming scheme</strong> and then force all the important players in the font industry to accept it as a standard. I am sure we all would benefit from such initiative.</p>
<p>If the glyph names would have standardized suffices, FontLab (or third party developers) could offer tools to build OT features based on glyph suffices and glyph names. It would be easier to work with encoding files etc. It could also help programmers, their scripts and testing routines would be accessible to a broader group of users without the need to modify the code; also the scripts designed to build OT features based on glyph suffices would be easier to write and use. The font production would benefit as well: it would be easier to copy features from one font to another etc. etc.</p>
<p>This new standard could be used in two different ways. I can imagine FontLab would allow users to switch between production glyph names and standardized glyph names. During font export, the glyphs could be automatically converted to proper glyph names (uniXXXX, afiiXXXX).</p>
<p>What should we do?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standardize glyph suffices.</strong> We could either follow Adam Twardoch recommendation to use suffices based on standardized code for OT features, either we could use more user-friendly suffixes (sups v. superior). We should discuss this.</li>
<li><strong>Standardize glyph names with two or more suffices.</strong> For example alternative form of small cap A (a.small_alt, a.alt_smcp&hellip;).</li>
<li><strong>Standardize glyph names for ligatures.</strong> Should we use ffi, f_f_i or both? Should we assign Unicode indices to ligatures? How to name ligatures composed of alternative forms of glyphs? This should be discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Create user-friendly names</strong> for Cyrillic and other glyphs. I understand that to name Cyrillic glyphs could be a difficult task as not all the users pronounce the letters the same way, but I am sure type designers would benefit from this standard (even if the standard would only be for production). Also many other glyphs should have names: arrows, letter-like symbols, math symbols, dingbats&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>Create a &ldquo;Typophile Glyph List for New Fonts&rdquo;</strong> and offer type designers tools to covert old glyph names to this new standard and tools to convert this proprietary encoding back the current standards. This should be accompanied with a document explaining problematic glyphs, their names and Unicode indices (scommaaccent v. scedilla, fi v. f_i etc.), language specific problems (ligatures and small caps in Turkish etc) and other exceptions and irregularities.</li>
</ol>
<p>I look forward to your feedback.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Much of the f lig naming thing seems to be from what glyphs are part of the standard. The problem comes with re-seperating the lig into its native characters when making a text file for PDF files. f_f_l will work but ffl won&rsquo;t. The ligs fi and fl are part a standard encoding but require some shoehornimng to extract to readable text in ascii&ndash;hence the underscore versions. I hope their is some way to fix this. In OpenType, the liga feature can be written to make the f_f_l lig instead of the ffl lig out of f f l but I don&rsquo;t know about non-opentype fonts. I hope John Hudson, Si Daniels, Thomas Phinney, and Adam will come by and correct my interpretation as well as chime in on your ideaa.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Chris, for you reply. Actually, I understand the glyph naming problems quite well, but not all the type designers do. My proposal is not only build a list of glyph names, but also tools to use it, and explanation why to use it. The knowledge is hidden in many threads here at Typophile and other forums but it should be collected and offered to everyone. In the end, we all would benefit from it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This topic surfaces from time to time. It seems to usually be directed to us here at Adobe. There is usually some internal debate about it, so I don&rsquo;t want to imply that we (Adobe people) are all of one mind on the subject&hellip; but we&rsquo;ve collectively considered and rejected such proposals before.</p>
<p>For quite a while I was the person who was most directly confronted with glyph name issues, having to produce many of the fonts and create tools to handle them. (And we just revised the entire library, which gave me even more cause to agonize over glyph names.) Now that Miguel has joined us, he might be using and managing glyph names just as much &ndash; and of course everyone else in the group also has some exposure and opinion.</p>
<p>I dare say that for most of the OpenType era, but at least for the past five years or so, we have had fairly stable name standards at Adobe. But it&rsquo;s true that some names have changed. The thing is, we are usually pretty thoughtful about choosing names, and so the fact that we have changed them is the exact reason why I am reluctant to endorse some universal standard. No matter how thoughtful we are, something happens later to provoke a change to something. The more canonized a list becomes, the more trouble it becomes when a name changes &ndash; and believe me, with a library of fonts as huge as Adobe&rsquo;s, that kind of trouble can be pretty unpleasant.</p>
<p>We do have our own [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html|glyph name conventions]], but I sense that this proposal is more about name suffixes, which are of no particular consequence in Adobe&rsquo;s recommendations. Some favor the feature-code-as-suffix approach (e.g. &ldquo;seven.dnom&rdquo;), while Adobe and others favor the descriptive approach (e.g. &ldquo;seven.denominator&rdquo;). For base names, Adobe name conventions have worked fairly well for us, as they rely on a manageable list of the most common names, falling back on reliable uni names for the rest.</p>
<p>For suffixes, I am personally worried about &ldquo;attaching&rdquo; a layout feature to a glyph, when our association of features to glyphs is subject to change. There are already plenty of examples of Adobe fonts where we have moved a glyph from one feature to another. Of course now &ndash; after the growing pains of OpenType in the early years &ndash; we think we have it figured out pretty well, but there will be new issues and new features. It&rsquo;s already painful enough to consider moving a glyph from one feature to another because of compatibility issues, but things would get much scarier if I wanted to move, say, &ldquo;A.salt&rdquo; to the &ldquo;ss01&rdquo; feature. There could be cases of a glyph being accessed via two different features, or (as you illustrated) multiple alternates from one character in the same feature. All that can be handled one way or another with a name standard, but in can get complicated and increase the chances of mistakes (i.e. non-standard or conflicting names). A little freedom in this territory can be be nice to have.</p>
<p>If you get the sense that I am fearful of change, you would be partially correct&hellip; but it&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;ve been trying for ten years to weed out all the peculiarities of our glyph names, and things are starting to finally settle down a bit. I like the names we use at Adobe, and don&rsquo;t mind that others use their own conventions. It seems like the current balance gives enough necessary structure and predictibility without boxing us in.</p>
<p>By the way, regarding ligature names: They are pretty much settled in Adobe&rsquo;s name conventions. A name &lsquo;&ldquo;fi&rdquo; refers to the single Unicode (ligature) character, whereas &ldquo;f_i&rdquo; refers to a ligature of two characters. It is indeed tricky to figure out suffixes for ligatures of alternates (e.g. &ldquo;f_i.alt&rdquo;), and even at Adobe I don&rsquo;t think we have much of a system other than semi-arbitrary &ldquo;alt1&rdquo;, &ldquo;alt2&rdquo;, and so on. So even if this thread doesn&rsquo;t result in some massive name overhaul, I think there&rsquo;s still a lot to discuss and improve in some areas.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Christopher,
Adobe is a large corporation that has a staff to work together on their work process. I am glad you are all willing to share your experiences with the rest of the community. On the other hand, those of us who do not have Adobe&rsquo;s resources need to work with each-other to minimize wasted time and reinvention of the wheel. While I am sure there is much we can borrow from the Adobe method, there may also be things small foundries and individual designers can gain from going a slightly different path. I am not talking about breaking unicode standards, I am talking about developing working conventions which we can share easily that may not end up on the release files. I am not sure if this is what Filip alludes to but I certainly support his effort.
As an example: If I develop a font with suffixes smcp and someone else uses sc, it is harder to share and teach each-other. If someone like Filip does work for small foundries and every file he gets to work on has a different {yet opentype compliant) scheme, it requires more work for him and he has to charge his clients (us) more for it. If we all agree on a system, things move faster, cheaper, and with fewer chances for errors. Adobe does all of their work inhouse so this is not an issue for them unless individuals within Adobe don&rsquo;t follow corporate standards.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Filip &ndash; <cite>1. / 2. / 3.</cite></p>
<p>Adobe&rsquo;s glyph naming and unicoding document says what&rsquo;s relevant, and &ndash; obviously &ndash; for good reasons avoids being too specific about suffixes since, in the end they are of little relevance. Except for production which you have in mind.</p>
<p>I would read Christopher Slye&rsquo;s comment this way:</p>
<p>What is important is that suffixes are descriptive, in a meaningful way. Then it does not matter whether you use &lsquo;sc&rsquo; or &lsquo;smcp&rsquo;,* or how you arrange multiple suffixes &ndash; they can be &lsquo;translated&rsquo; into whatever a script needs. As to combining multiple suffixes, even this can be done in many ways. For example, I combine them like &lsquo;A.sc.alt.swash&rsquo; (not that I ever did such a glyph). For a script a period and an underscore are equally fine, as is the suffix order &ndash; unless this has some special meaning for a <cite>particular</cite> script.
Old fonts with completely arbitrary glyph names (or worse: glyph names that do not even represent the letterform, like a ligature named &lsquo;less&rsquo;) need a human being anyway to &lsquo;translate&rsquo; glyph names.</p>
<p>Same goes, by the way, for class names. Make a name as descriptive as possible, with information on case, script, whether the class is 1st or 2nd of kerning pair if it&rsquo;s a kerning class, etc. This may be helpful for <cite>possible</cite> scripts. (Class names won&rsquo;t go into the compiled font anyway.)</p>
<p>Filip &ndash; <cite>This new standard could be used in two different ways. I can imagine FontLab would allow users to switch between production glyph names and standardized glyph names. During font export, the glyphs could be automatically converted to proper glyph names (uniXXXX, afiiXXXX).</cite></p>
<p>An option to converting production to final names upon font generation is on my wishlist too. AFDKO&rsquo;s GOADB is a nice model for this. Another option could replace suffixes upon generation, to help abbreviate glyph names.
Another option: Some tag (glyph name suffix? another &lsquo;negative&rsquo; .enc file?) could indicate which glyph are to be deleted upon font generation.</p>
<ul>
<li>For educational purposes, one can easily say that what is &lsquo;sc&rsquo; to me, is &lsquo;smcp&rsquo; to you. Same for scripts. Personally I think that every font is different, and it isn&rsquo;t possible to transfer features from one font to the other, or generate them.
Indeed a lot can be learned from Adobe&rsquo;s experiences. Christopher Slye&rsquo;s description suggests that they do internally what independent designers/foundries try to do externally: coordinate the work of different people.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think a standardised glyph naming scheme is necessary, beyond what Adobe define for glyph-to-character parsing, which is obviously a different need than that of font developers, hence the distinction between final glyph names in shipping fonts and what I call development or production glyph names. I&rsquo;m also not convinced that there is a need for a standardised set of development glyph names, because as soon as you have two sets of names &ndash; final and development &ndash; that need to be convertible, you need a robust means of mapping from one set of glyphs to another and performing reversible conversions. And as soon as you have that, you have the means to switch between any other set of glyph naming conventions.</p>
<p>Similarly, I don&rsquo;t think something like FontLab auto-generation of OTL lookups based on glyph names requires a standardised set of glyph names. What it does need is a means for developers to associate whatever suffixes they like with particular layout features. I don&rsquo;t want a tool like FontLab to force me into using particular glyph names: I want to be able to tell the tool what glyph names I was to use.</p>
<p>Some things that we now do may be a bit simpler if there were a standard set of glyph names, but I&rsquo;m not sure this justifies the effort to produce and agree on such a set. And what if, sometime after the set is agreed, I come up with a better method for, say, naming Devanagari glyphs or Arabic ligatures? Should I refrain from making use of that better method, for the sake of conformity? I know from looking back at the evolution of my own glyph naming systems that they have gradually improved as I work on different and different kinds of projects.</p>
<p>So what I value is having powerful and flexible tools to allow me to convert between naming systems.</p>

Better to mirror the open-source method: write your standard, release it, get feedback, tweak it, and provide it as a good starting point.
