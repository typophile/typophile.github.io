  body: "I'm not exactly sure what you mean by poetry typography. Do you mean general
    typography of, say, a book of poems? Or like concrete poetry? Here are some cool
    links I've found, googling around (readability really varies):\r\n\r\nhttp://cvhsdesign.edublogs.org/files/2011/02/Day_and_Night_Typography_by_TarynAbime-2aptqti.jpg\r\nhttp://eckovision.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/starlight-in-a-bottle-photo.jpg\r\nhttp://books.sorodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/poems-layout1.gif\r\nhttp://books.sorodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/poems-layout2.gif\r\nhttp://eckovision.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/breach-photo.jpg\r\nhttp://themarvelouslife.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/fear-typography.jpg
    (This one, I really, really like)\r\n\r\nI decided to just do links, because they're
    weird sizes, and I didn't want to break typophile. Plus I'm a bit lazy."

  body: "Thanks for that TylerEldredge, I did a search but nothing came up like your
    search results.\r\n\r\nI was given a poem to type up because the writing was so
    bad you could hardly read it, plus the grammar was off and so on. It was a good
    opportunity for me to try to make it a showcase on typography. It turned out well
    (IMO) but he asked me not to post it on the internet. Not for publication.\r\n\r\nStill
    not entirely sure where to draw the line editing his poem, should I have left
    it intact with all the 'errors'? Gabriola with stylistic set 5 was used, 'fancy'
    corners from Indesign, he was impressed. :)\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Interesting!\r\nPersonally, I'm wondering if anyone has seen some outstanding
    examples of more traditional typesetting of a book of poems (By traditional I
    just mean \"regular\" as opposed to concrete poetry, where the design does not
    alter the meaning of the poems.). One would think that books of poetry by the
    top contemporary poets would all be designed especially well, but alas this is
    not the case.  There is a frequent lack of attention to the most basic principles,
    as well as plenty of \"over-designing\" with zillions of typefaces, random doodads,
    recurring clips of the same badly pixelated photo, etc. \r\nTo me one especially
    difficult element to design in a poetry book is the margins. Many collections
    have poems that are all flush left but with widely varying line lengths from poem
    to poem. Many designers seem to ignore this, as though they believe that the right
    margin setting they typed in the computer will appear as a design element even
    though no text or other printed element ever aligns with it. Books designed with
    mirror margins this way look like they have a completely random layout page to
    page.\r\nSo I would love to hear some nominations for the best poetry book designs
    out there-- doesn't need to be online examples."

    generally have excellent design and layouts, in my opinion.

  body: "Not exactly on topic, but \u2014\r\n\r\nThe original edition of \"How Does
    a Poem Mean\" by John Ciardi (don't know if there's been another edition since)
    has a very utilitarian, textbooky design that isn't beautiful but works surprisingly
    well. The edition I have was clearly set in Linotype or Monotype and printed letterpress
    (you can feel the impression). It's interesting to see how the typographer contends
    with the scansion markings, which sometimes appear to be drawn in. I wonder if
    the type was set and printed, the arrows added by hand, and then the sheet photographed
    and printed as a plate. Although there's nothing particularly nice about the plain
    and rather quirky design, I have a fondness for it. It does, to address silvers's
    comment, center each poem on its longest line."
