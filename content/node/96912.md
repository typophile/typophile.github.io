body: "Hey fellow typophiles,\r\n\r\nI just wrote an article on the premise that typography
  and hand-lettering are, in fact, very different disciplines (*gasp*), in order to
  clarify the definition because of the rampant misuse of terminology (we've all seen
  plenty of \"35 Samples of Great Hand-Lettered Typography\" articles). However, one
  of the reviewers was disturbed by this claim and demanded sources from \"prominent
  typographers both contemporary and historical.\"\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of sources
  that may satisfy this reviewer? I have a few quotes from books that I own that I
  can use, as well as Jessica Hische's talk at the Frontend 2011 conference (http://www.frontend2011.com/video/jessica-hische.html),
  but she is in fact a lettering artist and not a typographer, and I'd love to see
  if there are any serious typographers who'd have quotes on this. Thanks so much!"

    body: "Either typographers or type designers. Sadly, the job of the \"typographer\"
      means very little in our modern digital landscape, but there are still people
      who set type manually (letterpressers, etc.) or specialize in typography even
      if they use digital means. \r\n\r\nIn fact, even quotes from letterers would
      do, since I think the reviewer is persisting in using \"typographer\" to mean
      anyone having anything to do with letters."

    if you go to Noordzij you're opening a can of worms - remember he's the guy who

    about this on Typophile :-) all that's going to happen is he's going to use any
    such ambiguity against Joseph's stance (which hopefully we all know is watertight).\r\n\r\nBTW
    in my view pretty much anything Noordzij has said is valid in proportion to its
    <em>distance</em> from type.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to or cited from a publication.\r\n\r\nHaha, that is a good point about Noordzij!
    I looked up his site and it seems that what he is saying is simply that they're
    both a graphic representation of a spoken language, but there are major practical
    differences.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the article is that with the resurgence of
    mainstream popularity of type and lettering there has been a lot of confusion
    of terms among those who haven't put much study into it. It explains the basic
    definitions of typography and lettering, highlighting why we shouldn't use \"typography\"
    to mean lettering as is so commonly done, and gives a historical background of
    the development of each. Not much to argue with. The other reviewers were very
    positive."
