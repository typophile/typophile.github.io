  body: I got it, but didn't understand why it is upside down.  Is the kerning supposed
    to get looser to the right?  I guess I would need some more info to critique this
    as a brand identity.  Right now, I am just confused as to what it is all about,
    but slightly intrigued too.

    inside their heads for this kind of thing!\r\n\r\nSpacing is much tighter on the
    left than on the right. It's hard to judge kerning until the spacing is even throughout."

  body: "A little context:  This is for a new record label focused around ambient
    recordings, so it can be a little bit out there, assuming (by nature of the project)
    that the audience is more design literate than the average bear.  My goal is not
    instantly recognizable, but hopefully decipherable within 10 seconds. I have it
    treated on the label a bit differently to where it can only be read while the
    record is playing.  Quiet transmissions.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to be progressively
    spaced out (like the music), and want to make sure that it looks like an even
    progression.  I also don't want to start too tight on the l-o-v nor get too loose
    on the d-a-y, which makes the job a bit more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe reason for
    the upside-downness: I want the viewer to look up at it.  Like hot metal from
    heaven."

  body: 'I like the idea. Coming back to the question of legible though: either because
    of, or in spite of the fact that I''m a designer, at first I saw the shapes as
    alien (there''s something Arabic about it at first) and so I''d be very wary of
    alienating people...if there''s too much figuring out to do, people give up and
    feel bad.'

  body: "I definitely see an alien, arabic form to it, and to me that's its strength!
    \ It's very much like the music, in which familiar sounds become alien, but the
    harmony of all the elements keep it from alienating the listener (or registering
    as just plain noise).  I certainly don't want people to feel bad!  I want it to
    be more of an a-ha! experience that ends positively and leaves the viewer feeling
    a bit more clued-in.  I'm assuming from the viewer a heightened state of visual
    receptiveness in the same way they need to be open to new sounds as a listener.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also considering how people will be accessing this logo, which will, for the most
    part be from a spelled-out URL.  So it will be less about <em>what</em> it says
    and more about <em>how</em> it says what you know it is. \r\n\r\n...and I think
    we DO have mirrors inside our heads!  We can watch TV sideways and read AMBULANCE
    when it's flipped..."

  body: In the context you are working, I do think that the initial confusion works
    OK.  I think you actually have too many concepts here.  The tracking increasing
    from left to right is too subtle, and in my opinion not a very compelling concept.  I
    do like the idea of meditating to find the text among what initially seems like
    an unknown script, and I think it could work as if we are looking up at the letters,
    but I think that could be accomplished without it oriented as if we are looking
    at the back of the letters.  Hopefully that helps!

    doing one too many things, and spacing the letters evenly is the right move."

  body: 'i would try to incorporate some ideas that make up ambient music. To me,
    the music is more about the textures and the synergy that is created when those
    textures overlay. Though bare in mind, that when I say that, i''m thinking of
    artists such as Jefre Cantu-Ledesma,  Rafael Anton Irrisarri, Deaf Center, Tim
    Hecker etc. '
