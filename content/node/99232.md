    ID Board\", which is where people hang out who like identifying fonts, rather
    than this 'general discussion' group.\r\n\r\nHowever, before you move it there
    (or someone moves it for you) I have a couple of questions:\r\n\r\nWhat do you
    mean \"actually located on 'this' site\"? What website are you talking about?
    Or, where did you find these images? Offhand, they look like they're from an alphabet
    of raster graphics (like jpg images) without the clean outlines that a font will
    usually have. Either that or they're a font created from a very low resolution
    scan.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "Those are almost certainly Initial Caps rather than a complete UC and LC
    font and probably are ca. 1870's.\r\n\r\nI too could not find the font either
    in current fonts, specimen books on hand or the net, but I have a big shortage
    of European specimens so it may have originated there. When you do your search,
    I suggest keywords: ornate, initials, ornamented, etc. in various combinations
    and see what you may turn up."
