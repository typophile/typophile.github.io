  supremacy. Can we keep it up?\r\n\r\nI think it deserves a time-wasting yet difficult
  challange: \r\nWho can design their own avatar to perfectly mimic that of another
  person's? You gotta do it from scratch or if you do swipe parts, do it cleverly.
  (Which is the motto of design, no?) No cheating!\r\n\r\nCategories are:\r\n1) Most
  Difficult \u2013 Repeat the impossible\r\n2) Quantity \u2013 How many can you do?\r\n\r\nThe
  winner gets to claim the title of \"AVATAR MASTER\"."

    of comments that his avatar is too big (the stipulation is 60 pixels square).\r\nNo
    battle.\r\nIt's cool that he's inverted mine.\r\nI tried his out for me, but decided
    I'd stick with mine for several reasons, mostly the animation. I like the way
    when we're both posting that the colour cycling isn't sync'ed."
