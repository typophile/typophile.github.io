What I posted is a Logo for a new design company.
It is more illustrative than typographic.
Any comments?
Quicky Logo 02 because for the first time i posted it for the wrong forum...

<div class=commentbody>Don't know about Hungary but Quicky carries connotations in English.
I have to wonder about the figure, it doesn't seem to be leaping anything in particular, I mean he is not going to clear the whole word left to right and the movement doesn't seem background to foreground. As Grot has mentioned smaller sizes might require a simplified drawing to avoid filling in.

<div class=commentbody>Even at that size, your logo (inc. Quicky) wordmark will still be large. Post it back, along with your wordmark, and you'll see that it's still big. Even in print at a smaller size, this will fill in because it's fiddly and you also have to take into consideration what it looks like when photocopied/faxed and signage/t-shirts/whatever else that is printed but not necessarily high quality. Also Tim's picked up on a big point - here in the UK, the word Quicky would carry the connotation of a quick shag - maybe the guy's bed-hopping? ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK Guys!
I understand the name problem. Let's leave it because we can change that. We are not in the phase where we can't.
The fill in problem. I don't think it would happen because,
1. Printing on a T-shirt - (as you know for sure) - It is a different technique. So that is another topic.
2. 300 dpi - fairly enough for even more detailed graphics-if you use black-it is a SPOT color. There are no dots-That's why we can print out 3 pt letters. :)
3. Fax/Photocopy - Let's use bigger logo and letters! :)
I use 9 pt letters even for the address...ect.
But the "size" connection between the wordmark and the illustration= The word mark is too big - I agree. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Ear, nose, temple, hands, t-shirt sleeve, forearms, creases on both thighs are all losing detail in your smaller image, print it on newsprint or in a phone book and it will have trouble, it's not just the dpi but the absorbency of the paper, the pressure used to pass on the ink for both gravure and litho, coarse screen for screen printing etc. but if you can live with that then that is your choice. Equally important to my mind is that the figure seems to be jumping for no particular reason (unless he has just had a quicky:)

<div class=commentbody>It wasn't the best try maybe, but my goal is to create a logo wich is not talking about the design but talking about my feelings about design.
What I think of graphic design: it's freedom but without control U R not jumping but falling...
I'm bored with minimalism and useless simplification. Most of the cases -in logodesign for xmpl- simplification comes from the lack of drawing ability.
So in my case the base -wich is drawing- very important.
So i think this way of thinkink is also OK:
"Wich firm? Ah! The jumpig guy!"
Is it really important to underline the Graphic design?
For xmpl "xy interactive"-with a jumpig guy , it is up to you what u r thinking about the illustration wich articulates freedom...</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>I don’t understand the illustration. What relationship does it have with your business. I would guess, nothing. Its Illustration for illustration sake.</em>
I tend to agree with that.
I immediately associated Quickie with a quick shag ... maybe that's just me.

Lets forget Quickie or Quicky or whatever!
It was a wrong idea!
Maybe with a name like this "GiantLeap Interactive"... (just for the xmpl - I know it is a stupid name! :)
There are many logos out there wich are not talking about the exact business but express something else - The vision of the firm - this separates the firm from the others.

<div class=commentbody>But with an expressive name like "quickie" the message gets confusing.
For example ...
With XY Networks, a jumping person could imply freedom (of stress)
I think I get waht you mean. Maybe not.

<div class=commentbody>I get the feeling that this is totally up in the air - you seem now to be trying to tailor a potential name to the illustration - which is a problem. Identify exactly what it is that you want to communicate and start over. It's not that I dislike the jumping guy (I don't), I just don't think it's suitable for purpose, as discussed previously. If you don't pin anything solid down, like your company name, you have no foundations on which to develop your identity</div>

Leap could work, I don't know whether this has connotations in Hungary or anywhere else though and it would have to compete against 2 billion other hits on google. Jump only has 1 billion hits. Spring on the other hand is positively rare. All good active positive names though.

<div class=commentbody>I re-read all the comments and i realized that the core of the ciritics is this: -
Problems with the first version:
1. Quicky - connotations
2. Make clear connection between the illustration and the wordmark otherwise it will be confusing
My conclusion is that: If i can find a word wich says-jump, leap or spring or breakthrough but one can understand it also as a mental process i can keep the guy.
The other thing is that - i will try the logo with some scripts also. Maybe it will be more united with the handmade illustration!
If it will be ready i will post it to this topic! (Few days)
Thanx for the critics!!!! Don't forget to tell me what is "legover" :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>A legover is another term for sex, as in "get your legover". I was just lowering the tone of your thread, sorry.
I quite like the combination of illustration and typeface, my concern was more the relationship of the two and the narrative (where/what the guy was leaping).
