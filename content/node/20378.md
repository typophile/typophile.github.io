  are using. Seems kinda familiar, but I can't really point it down.\r\n\r\nI'm mostly
  wondering about the thin font on the Mischa Barton cover, but the others would be
  nice to know too. \r\n\r\nAny ideas? \r\n\r\nIt's impossible to get this magazine
  in Denmark, so if anyone knows if it's worth a subscription please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,
  as always!\r\n\r\n"

    Condensed</a> from Hoefler & Frere-Jones, some of which is squooshed a little.
    I'd guess they manipulated Whitney or Whitney Condensed to get the words Mischa
    Barton, or, it could be some wacky custom font from Hoefler & Frere-Jones.

  body: Giant's actually a pretty amusing magazine. They simultaneously skewer and
    celebrate our obsession with pop culture.
