  enjoyed the thread examining the choice of Papyrus, and thought...hey\u2014I wonder
  how cool it could have been if Cameron had called on some pros...\r\n\r\nHere are
  a few pics of treatments I found advertising Avatar in various stages of the (long
  long) project, etc:\r\n\r\n"

    a fat check. And then charge the client an outrageous fee for a recycled composition
    and laugh all the way to the bank.

    \r\n\r\nFirst I'd get half the money up front, and then I'd subcontract the rebranding
    work to Armin Vit and the caption job to Joe Clark. "

  body: "I wonder how often things like a film's logotype end up decided in a committee
    board room stuffed chock-full of studio representatives and stakeholders and marketing
    and advertising departments and film supervisors all goup-art-directing everything
    into mush. In such a minefield it'd probably be tempting to just open the door,
    pull the pin and toss in a comp with glowy blue papyrus. \r\n\r\nOf course, when
    you've made as much cash as James Cameron (who's probably a far safer and more
    profitable investment bet than the stock market come to think of it)\u2014I bet
    you'd have the pull to keep control over your film's logoform...\r\n\r\nI like
    Armin Vit, and I'd like to see him put his own work up more often for the legions
    of snarky logo-sharks always commenting over at Brand New...love the sub-contracting
    idea, but I'd probably be too excited and greedy to subcontract. I mean, unless
    I was too busy doing title sequences for David Fischer or something...although
    hiring a great, raw, ink-loving calligrapher might get things to an interesting
    place visually..."

    an extremely dangerous mission - minimal chance of returning alive. They hire
    an agent to recruit the best candidate for the money. The guy finds a French woman,
    she asks for 2 million dollars. Too much money. Then he finds a German man, he
    asks for 1 million dollars. Still too much. So he goes to Vartanik, an Armenian
    guy, and tells him to please give him a good price. Vartanik says 5 million dollars.
    The recruiter says: \"Are you crazy, the others wanted much less! How could you
    ask for 5 million?!\" Vartanik replies: \"1 million for me, 2 million for the
    French babe to move in with me, 1 million for you to pick me for the mission,
    and we send the German.\"\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    were I a competent professional type designer with such a responsibility, I would
    design a quality custom font for the movie, so that value would be received for
    money.\r\n\r\nBut what kind of a font? To say what it would look like, one would
    need to give examples.\r\n\r\nAdobe Present might be a good substitute for Papyrus
    if you're opening a sushi restaurant, but it's the wrong kind of font for this
    kind of movie. Ondine and Lydian are clearly wrong.\r\n\r\nEreshkigal, and Papyrus
    itself, might be good sources of inspiration. So might Codex or Oxalis.\r\n\r\nFor
    that matter, Outpost might be a goud source of inspiration... but that font doesn't
    seem to be in MyFonts.\r\n\r\nAh... [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/rhino/|Rhino]]
    might be a good source of inspiration."

  body: "From what I can tell, it wasn't a default version of Papyrus. Looks less
    frail, and a few elongated / follow-through strokes. I rarely like Papyrus. It
    seems to litter photographer logos, just like Curls MT pollutes illustrators portfolios.
    But I like what the roughness of the strokes accomplished that all the other examples
    lacked. The provided linked logotypes seemed to miss the point, and unfortunately
    focused more on the corporate army side of the movie, compared to the Fern Gully/Pocahontas/Avatar
    side of the movie.\r\nA congratulations is in order that Papyrus was used in what
    will be a certain box office record holder, while the reigning champion, Trajan,
    was dethroned.\r\n\r\n* I have never used Papyrus on anything serious. :)"
