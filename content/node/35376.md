  to reinstall!\r\n\r\nAny clues?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nR"

  body: "Do you have a sample that shows what this typeface look like? As you may
    know, there are often many mis-named fonts circulating, and we may recognize this
    font by another name. The only search that came up with a font showed something
    called 'Verdict SF' used for making do-it-yourself labels, and that was a rip-off
    of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/windsor/\">Windsor</a>.\r\n\r\n-
