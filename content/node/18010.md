  it was used in 1914 and, of course, NY didn\u2019t exist. Any ideas? It had bold
  and italics as well, which NY doesn\u2019t have. Seems like it should be really
  easy for some of you\u2026\r\nBest\r\nRobert"

    edit (again) - I don't know why I said ITC (founded in  1969, I think.....)\r\n"

  body: It's probably one of the various faces called Antique. Most foundries had
    such faces, not identical, but similar. ATF's Bookman was a consolidation of several
    of these.

  body: The "Antiques" I'm talking about have not been around for almost a century.
    There are similar faces still around, such as Bookman. It's not likely you'll
    find a perfect match in a current font.

  body: "There were only 6 letters in the sample that I could use in the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\"
    target=\"new\">Serif Font ID Guide</a>:  (a, b, e, g, y and W) . With those I
    came up with 39 fonts, including Bruce Old Style, several Century versions, some
    Caslons, several Bookmans, including Phemister's original from 1860, Old Style
    No. 7 and a scattering of other faces too modern to be considered. If you could
    show a sample with a few more of the Guide's Key letters (such as E, J, K, M,
    R and U) the results could be narrowed down much more. As Mark suggested this
    could be something that has no perfect current match, but you might see something
    that would be hard to tell from it without precise comparison.\r\n\r\n(Unfortunately,
    the Guide is still in work, and we are still making sample images, but the names
    of fonts meeting the key characteristics are shown with the design, foundry and
    date information.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    ATF''s Oldstyle No. 583, from their 1912 specimen book, rather heavily inked.'

  body: 'Last night while doing a little research in an old Linotype specimen book,
    I found a better match: Linotype Antique No. 1. It''s also a more likely candidate,
    since the text in a book of any length would probably be set my machine, rather
    than by hand.'

  body: "For what it's worth, if you want another vote, I just looked at an old Linotype
    book to see if that looks right, and I agree that Antique No. 1 is very close.
    The weight and letterforms look just about right. The clincher would be to see
    the R, because Antique No. 1 has an odd leg on the R that thickens toward the
    baseline, without much of a serif, unlike the Antique Old Style in Jaspert..\r\n\r\n

  body: Could be, but my 1920 Linotype specimen book doesn't show old style figures
    for Antique No. 1 whereas Antique Old Style (the one shown in Jaspert) has them.
    It would be helpful to see the italic--Antique Old Style has a cursive italic,
    similar to Century Old Style, while Linotype's Antique No. 1 has a slanted italic,
    like Bookman.

    Actually, it shows both. Looks like maybe we are interested but the poster no

  body: "HI...thanks for all the great comments! \r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration
    I found Century Old Style to be the closest I could purchase commercially and
    indeed I had it on my machine as it comes with CS2. I tried that fancy-dancy super-duper
    online font id'er using my loupe on the characters but it wasn't very helpful
    as it turned out some bizarre results. Perhaps it just can't deal with such old
    fonts.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think that COS is pretty darn close and will have to do
    for this project. \r\n\r\nThanks again for all your help. Great suggestions and
    I learn lots everytime I come here!!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRobert"
