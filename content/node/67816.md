  which one would you go for: ITC Bodoni (12) or Walbaum Buch? I have a book set in
  Walbaum Buch, which is quite nice, but dark. I can't compare it to ITC Bodoni, but
  I heard it's good in text settings as well (better than any other Bodoni). What
  do you think? Or do you have other alternatives? Walbaum Text by Storm also seems
  pretty nice, but has a smaller x-height than the Buch, how would you rate it?\r\n\r\nThank
  you\r\n\r\nJeffrey "
