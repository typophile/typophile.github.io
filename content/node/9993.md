body: Hello,  <BR> <BR>I know I&#39;ve read this sometime ago on typophile, I need
  the volumetric symbol &#34;e&#34; that you can find in every bottle/packaging after
  the quantity &#40;ex. 75cl e&#41;. I know a font includes this but I don&#39;t remember
  the name... Thanks <BR>adriano

  body: Almost all Adobe OpenType fonts have this symbol. It should be treated as
    a logotype, not designed to match the typeface &#40;except to be scaled in height&#41;.
