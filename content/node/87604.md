  cardgame called [[http://cogentesque.wordpress.com|AtomPunk]] based in a nuclear
  fallout world. Similar to the Fallout game series, mad max, book of eli, tank girl
  etc.\r\n\r\nHumanity has taken shelter from the radiation fallout and have final
  clambered out after a few hundered years sometime after WW2 and during the early
  stages of the cold war. Retro-Future, pin-up glam, art deco, raygun gothic, post-apoc
  wasteland.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Edit: The \"file attachment\" and the html IMG tags both
  seem to be broken on the site, so to see the front cover that I reference above
  it is here:\r\nhttp://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1121728_lg.jpg )\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  have two questions to ask you sage and whistful typophiles;\r\n\r\n1. The front
  cover has some lovely ipsum-esque filler \"TEXT TEXT TEXT\" spattered all over it.
  It looks a little ... um ... \"Rush Hour\"y at the moment and I think is a little
  to action film. Are there some more ... fitting fonts around?\r\n\r\n2. I am in
  the process of creating both the game manual and a selection of short stories that
  are to be coupled together with the indy release of the game. I think it would be
  prudent if I kept the typygraphy consistant. That withstanding, is it better to
  keep to very functional readability and straight forwardness, or is there something
  that I can add to the reams of text to give them a bit of a more atmospheric feel
  without being cringe worthy? Perhaps just the headers? I would love to hear your
  thoughts\r\n\r\nThanks All,\r\n"

    text?\r\nI think you should revise the composition, giving the pin-up and the
    wordmark the front spot (now they look a bit overhelmed), and leaving the rest
    in the background as much as possible."
