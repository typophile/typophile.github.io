  body: Bickham Script, perhaps. I don't consider myself a "professional" at recommending
    fonts, but I used that font for the company's (where I work) 50th anniversary
    holiday party last year. The invite was designed like a wedding invitation --
    mostly white, a touch of "gold" and black type. It worked really well for that
    in combo with Copperplate Gothic (33bc, I think it was) that I used for most of
    the copy "meant to be read." (It's not an ambitious combo for fonts -- I don't
    get much free rein with fonts here.) That font above seems to be a little on the
    casual and froofy side, for lack of better term. But maybe that's what she wants.
    It could work in the right proportions. Good luck.

  body: i actually kind of like the idea of scriptina, but the spacing is terrible,
    the letters are poorly drawn, and i hate the colliding loops in double character
    such as dd, &c. i think scriptina would be okay with (quite) a bit of attention.
    Does anyone know where to find more info about scriptina? Who is it designed by?
    is it really legit? is there a EULA for it anywhere. Dennis, maybe you can help
    me out?

  body: "I was just looking at Bickley as an option as I already have it and I agree
    with PD Hunt about Scriptina but I've seen it too many times before like Zapfino
    and was looking for something that gave me an edge? I'm hoping to use the script
    oversized as a clear spot varnish on a white card so it's not to in ya face with
    a mocca shade type over the top of that?\r\n\r\nScripts are soooo difficult to
    get right in my opinion, with other types you can usually say yep I love it or
    noooooo that font is making my eyes bleed, but script....???\r\n\r\nDeano."

    used <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/34004\">here</a> which made me lose
    the thread. Maybe someone else wants to read it again and tell who's the founder
    of Scriptina. "

  body: "<cite>Dennis, maybe you can help me out?</cite>\r\n\r\nIn another thread
    someone offered to fix it up a bit, but didn't want to do it without the author's
    (Apostrophe, A.K.A. Fred Nader) permission. After some digging I found out he
    is off saving the world in a remote place (without internet), with a big non-profit
    organization. Conjecture is that he will be in touch maybe in November. I imagine
    he will give the go-ahead to any improvements.\r\n\r\nI will let people know when
    I hear from him."
