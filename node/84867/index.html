  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I started a new job recently and I have the opportunity to re-brand my company&rsquo;s corporate identity. We are a large construction company in the United States.</p>
<p>The typefaces we currently use are Garamond and Helvetica. They are both beautiful and I love them but <strong>everyone</strong> else loves them too. I was originally debating whether or not we should even change them but I eventually came to the conclusion that I would like to go with something not quite as common. Do you agree? I heard a good quote that helped me make this decision “Different is always better but better is always different.”</p>
<p>I realize that whatever I go with will not be completely unique to my company. I am fine with that. I don&rsquo;t want to be original at the expense of being good but I would like to at least find something that isn&rsquo;t on practically every truck, sign, brochure, and ad that I look at.</p>
<p>Ideally I would like to find a hidden gem that is well done and not overused (if such a thing exists). Something that will have credibility with the most experienced typographers, but also looks good to everyone else.</p>
<p>If anyone has suggestions I would greatly appreciate it. The department is small enough and the company is large enough where budget isn&rsquo;t really an issue. I have a few ideas in mind that it would be nice to have some feedback on as well. I am coming up with options for three concepts.</p>
<p>• <strong>Bold and proven.</strong> So far I am leaning towards [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100034&amp;path=head|Sentinel]], [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013&amp;path=head|Knockout]], [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100019&amp;path=head|The Proteus Project]], and [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100031&amp;path=head|Chronicle]]. Chronicle will be used sparingly, it will be reserved for occasions where we would like to be fancy such as formal invitations. Think of it as business formal. I realize that Hoefler and Frere-Jones fonts are well known but I have not seen them nearly as much as Helvetica and Garamond.</p>
<p>• <strong>Family owned, traditional, values.</strong> I haven&rsquo;t really come up with anything for this one yet.</p>
<p>• <strong>Gritty and tough.</strong> For this one I was thinking [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/amplitude.shtml|Amplitude]] and [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/farnham.shtml|Farnham]]. The etchings on Amplitude give it characters that I think fits and the strong serifs on Farnham convey a tough, sturdy feeling.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Proteus Project would provide a nice toolkit of strong and varied type. I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ll find a fair number of bold slab serifs in the construction industry once you start looking, though.</p>
<p>As for hidden gems, the rapid pace of type development/release these days means there are dozens of offerings from small foundries that haven&rsquo;t gotten their due. Look at releases from TypeTrust, Suitcase, Process Type Foundry, Village, A2 Type, You Work For Them, Lineto, among (many) others.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sentinel (and also Chronicle, but less fitting here in my opinion) are great, versatile typefaces and, as marcox said already, Proteus will probably lend itself for logos and display applications for a construction company. Personally I have seen too much Knockout lately.</p>
<p>Maybe it is because I worked with it for the last weeks, but I think Amplitude would be a really good fit and comes in many different styles. And then you can add Sentinel or something similar for a bit more grace.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you Kupfers. I have seen a lot of Knockout lately too. Anything by Hoefler and Frere-Jones probably runs the risks off falling into the overexposed category. If not now then some day. I don&rsquo;t think I have ever seen Amplitude used anywhere else. Of course once I start using it everyday without a doubt I&rsquo;m sure I will start seeing it pop up more.</p>
<p>I agree that Chronicle seems less fitting. Sometimes we need to create formal pieces so this is where I see Chronicle coming into play. I don&rsquo;t know though, I suppose a slab such as Sentinel could work for that though. Maybe just use it in light or use the italic. Plus four typefaces might be getting to be a bit much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Christian Schwartz is a fabulous designer. Farnham is designed to sparkle, and Williams Caslon to be serene. So it depends on the look you want, but they are going to be very different, I think. Amplitude has sparkle at large sizes because of the deep ink traps. There&rsquo;s also a [[http://christianschwartz.com/amphead.shtml|Headline version]] of Amplitude without ink traps.

<p>William explained it well — it depends on what you’re aiming at. That both typefaces are from the same designer might help (or feel safe) in other instances, but those two are very different in proportions and form. Or do you mean because of the “sparkling” inktraps?</p>
<p>I think Amplitude would work with a lot of seriffed typefaces. Maybe even your good old Garamond can come to new shine next to it. If you don’t need the serif this often, why not start with Amplitude and see how far you get? I’m doing a book about dance with it at the moment and find it quite elegant all by itself already.</p>
