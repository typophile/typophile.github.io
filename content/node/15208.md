  my eye.\r\n\r\nHave any of you used DTL Romulus? What are some of your \"expert\"
  opinions of this font? It seems like it would be a nice addition to my collection.\r\n\r\nI've
  heard good things about DTL Documenta, however. This one looks very usable."

  body: "Romulus is one of the most beautiful types ever designed. Its slanted Roman,
    in place of italic, is not a success though. DTL doesn't seem to have plans to
    do van Krimpen's Chanceleresca Bastarda, the great script companion to Romulus.
    \ \r\n\r\nIn spite of their great beauty, van Krimpen's faces always seem to have
    suffered from some flaw that prevented their wide use. \r\n\r\nPerhaps DTL will
    make a usable version. I hope so. But I don't believe it has been released. It
    has been promised for many years; now it looks like they do have a lot of it completed,
    but I have no idea when they will release it. \r\n\r\nFor a type that breathes
    Van Krimpen's spirit, but does it with it seems more usefulness than Van Krimpen
    himself, it seems, see the magnificant (and unbelievably expensive) <a href=\"http://www.teff.nl/fonts/trinite/trinite.html\">Trinite</a>.\r\n\r\n"

    to 3000 Euros for the whole family. This thing better sing on the page. I'm dying

    certainly, it looks good in the sample provided, but I wonder how it performs
    day-to-day. A good sign is that it was designed with today's laser printers in
    mind.\r\n\r\nI can tell that it'll probably need a bit more leading than normal."

    suspect that you could adjust these also, if you had the whole thing. \r\n\r\n\r\n>I

    It blows me away how good it looks though. I don't know if it has problems in
    practice, but I suspect it is pretty robust, at least the medium extender versions.

  body: "Jan Middendorp's book \"dutch type\" discusses and shows Trinite.\r\nMathieu
    Lommen/John Lane's biography of Bram de Does shows extensive text set in Trinite,
    as I recall. And discusses it at length. Both books should be available through
    the Dutch book seller Nijhof & Lee, which has a web site, and elsewhere that I
    forget.\r\nI worked at Autologic in the early '80s when it's Swiss subsidiary
    Bobst Graphic released Trinite for photosetting. The promotional booklet is a
    treasure. The cover is shown on pg 160 of Middendorp's book. I'm so happy I have
    these books and the booklet!\r\nBased on what I've read in the above books, I
    think Trinite had significant use in the Netherlands in the '80s.\r\nI'd buy and
    use it in a minute if it was affordable!\r\nBrian"

    in the Trinite section, simply click on \"sample sheet\" near the bottom.\r\n\r\nA
    true 1200dpi sheet is also available by mail order. It seems worth the wait for

  body: "I did get samples from TEFF. They look very good, but the extensive text
    sample uses the tallest ascenders and widest counter version, in a rather large
    size. It would be more informative to see the middle extenders and width--which
    Bringhurst recommends as practically useful--set more at text sizes. \r\n\r\nI
    would like to get the book on de Does, but not sight unseen...\r\n\r\n>I'd buy

    makes a fine text face for conventional use." I liked the ordinary roman (middle
    length extenders) and wide version best. But I would think that the best version
    would depend on the demands of a particular design. As I said, I don''t have it
    and haven''t used it, so I am guessing to a great extent. '
