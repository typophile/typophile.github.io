body: Are there simple tools to turn them off, or have them revert to fonts I'd like
  to read? Ideally, browsers should have a toggle switch that lets you substitute
  the served fonts with installed fonts via a personalized CSS, no? In many cases,
  I'd rather just see Georgia for text. Thanks for wanting to have me read something
  more interesting, but no thanks. :^D

    old font you want and ignore the generic font families though.

    has no user prefs for fonts without monkeying around. Safari requires a style
    sheet. IE and FF are simple and straight forward in the prefs, and what Kent said.

  body: I expect browsers will start adding a preference toggle specifically for downloadable
    fonts (as distinct from the toggles for remote CSS spec'd local fonts), in the
    same way as they have a toggle for e.g. Java. This will likely show up in the
    security options panel.

  body: For Chrome, Stylebot does exactly what I would like it to in terms of fonts.
    Now if only I could use it to make the Typophile forum divs a bit wider to give
    for a bit longer measure (or a shorter one on Wikipedia).

  body: What really annoys me is how so many web pages specify fonts unnecessarily.
    Lots of simple web-creation apps just automatically insert generic font stacks
    (usually beginning with Arial). CSS offers nice options for people to style their
    content, but I sure wish there were more authors and authoring tools that would
    just leave the choice to the user. I really like the primitive notion of the web
    providing pure information and leaving it to the user to select the environment
    that works best for them.

    maybe if the environment were a tad more adjustable maybe this would not be such
    an issue. But if a lot of people turn off custom fonts, like they do pop-ups,
    then a lot of publishers are compelled towards graphics, or go-ikea, where their
    type id is important. It's a viscous circle without the right stuff to go with
    @ff."

  body: Well ideally the designers of a site choose the font for a reason...right?
    Things like a typeface are integral to overall theme, feel, message, and layout
    of a website. Fonts are supposed to be specified for a reason, and any other font
    shouldn't be able to do the job quite as well, or the same.  Companies are interested
    in a cohesive image... Further more, I would imagine always specifying fonts cold
    lead to various, unexpected problems with formatting, etc...

    you're implying. Think of all the web pages out there... honestly, a small percentage
    of them (I think) need that level of design -- and that's assuming there's a typographically
    sensitive designer making it better, not worse."
