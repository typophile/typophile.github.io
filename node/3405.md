  body: IMO -- Because of the angles of the D and C there is a bit of a visual wave
    going on. Do you mean for this? I wonder if the angle of the D is a bit too much?
    Also, does the D seem too wide? I suppose the width of the D helps balance out
    the width of the M, but the visual wave seems too much even still.

  body: Tiffany -- <BR>Well, in thought, the &#39;wave&#39; was part of my original
    concept. More of action, or movement than a wave perse. Its really hitting a younger
    18-24 aged market. The &#39;D&#39; I had worries of being percieved as an &#39;O&#39;,
    maybe I have over compensated though? Hrant had proposed possibly straightening
    out the bottom arms of the &#39;C&#39;s&#39; maybe this would give it a little
    more of an anchored feeling. How do you feel about that? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

    &#40;Scottsdale Dream Center Master&#39;s Commission&#41; <BR> <BR>Im considering
    PMS 416 as one of the colors.. trying to settle on a secondary color right now.
    <BR>I may visualy seperate the SDC from the MC by using two different colors,
    or possible a lighter tint of one solid color.

    well 18-24 aged program. Realy a multi faceted, media type school. Drama, dance,
    multimedia... and such. very diverse group of students. It is a Christian based
    organization too.

  body: When you add the _words_ below the _acronym_ it might be that they are enough
    of a _flattening agent_ ... hmm .... I don&#39;t know. I do like the color separation
    though, it gives the teensiest visual rest from the up and down motion.

  body: Kyle, I was just reacting to the letterforms. If you drew parallel lines at
    the angles of your type above and below the type it would have a folded effect.
    Maybe its just me. Did you create a mark to go along with it? If I had to ask
    what the name meant, maybe alot of people will have to ask. Something along the
    lines of shilohettes of dancers on a christian symbol stage. Just a thought.
