  a revised, final draft of a new PDF specimen display for the Font Aid \"Coming Together\"
  Haitian earthquake benefit font. It's a 46 page PDF booklet created by Alison Eickhoff
  to show off all the great ampersands and give credit where credit is due to all
  the designers who helped make this font happen. Hundreds of links included.\r\n\r\nLet
  me know if you see any typos or broken links or other bugs and I will try to get
  it fixed. THis is just a preliminary draft that probably needs a little editing
  before it goes out to the distributors. \r\n\r\nSo here it is, have a gander, and
  let me know what you think. I think it's awesome and I'm so proud to have been able
  to help with this project. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n-chank\r\n"

    of the font is going well. At last count we had raised about $6500. I expect this
    number will continue to climb.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!\r\n\r\nMichelle"

    suggest changing 'England' to 'United Kingdom' on the last spread. I consider
    myself a Brit not an Englishman."

    spread thanks to Bendy's comment. I wonder why Korea isn't on the list; I consider
    myself foremost a Korean."

    We didn't ask people to provide their nationality, but many offered it and we
    attempted to compile the information as best we could. With almost 400 participants,
    it was a lot of data to collate.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else notices anything that needs
    to be corrected, please let us know and we'll make the correction.\r\n\r\nMichelle"
