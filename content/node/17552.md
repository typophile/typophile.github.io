  body: Thanks, Tim. This file came in as an .eps with outlines, so it's possible
    they manipulated the type as well.

    target=\"new\">Serif Font ID Guide</a> and, based mainly on the R, I agree with
    the Van Dijck pick, and another font that looks possible is Fred Smeijers' \"Custodia\"
    from <a href=\"http://www.ourtype.be/\" target=\"new\">OurType</a>. \r\n\r\n-
