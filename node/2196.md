  body: Was also thinking about a serif version of it font but maybe these are a bit
    too simple?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21181.gif" alt="">

  body: Sans is very nice. I am not crazy about the &#34;k&#34; It seems to break
    the continuity too much.  <BR> <BR>The &#40;slab&#41; Serif version does not please
    the eye &#40;at least my eye&#41;. The concept is not bad it just doesn&#39;t
    work. <BR> <BR>Additional weights?

  body: I think the serif one can work if you make the terminals flare, like in Copperplate,
    or maybe Adobe&#39;s Penumbra. <BR> <BR>hhp
