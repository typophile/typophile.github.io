  cover. I've got everything figured out except for the typeface used on the cover
  in the magazine topics: \"Fall Comfort!\" \"Steak Chili...\" etc. (shown in attachment).
  \r\n\r\nI used What the Font and the closest I could come up with is one of the
  fonts within FF Transit, although there are differences:\r\n\r\n-the letter \"k\"
  looks different on the magazine cover, the diagonal strokes meet in a \"t\"\r\n-the
  weight is heavier and letters more condensed than what I'm seeing in Transit \r\n-the
  ends of the C are angled on the cover \r\n\r\nI may be wrong on the typeface. What
  do you guys think? Is it an altered version of Transit? Hopefully I am wrong and
  it's a typeface within my library because I'm not paying for Transit! :)\r\n\r\nI've
  also included a screenshot of FF Transit Print Normal from Fontshop.com\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!"

    have that on my computer! Silly What the Font leading me astray...
