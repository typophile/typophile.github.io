<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>When making outlines of fonts in illustrator, they seem to get bolder on the screen. <br>Is this just on the screen, or on the print as well? <br> <br></div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Nope, that's because you lose the font rasterizing once they're <br>converted to outlines, and in some older versions of Illustrator <br>the anti-aliasing too. <br> <br>As long as your characters are "text", ATM - or any other font <br>rasterizer for that matter - smoothes out the edges of the <br>characters to improve their appearance on your computer <br>monitor. This is called anti-aliasing, a process where pixels at <br>the edges of the character shapes are filled with a percentage of <br>the original colour of the text. Once you convert the characters <br>to outlines, they stop being "font" and become plain graphic <br>objects, just like any other shape you'd draw in Illustrator. As a <br>result the font rasterizer loses its influence on the character <br>shapes, which makes the pixels at the edges turn 100% colour. <br>This is why suddenly your text looks a bit bloated. As the <br>character shape doesn't change at all, it's only a visual effect on <br>screen and it doesn't affect the end result in print at all.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>As the character shape doesn't change at all, it's only a visual effect on screen and it doesn't affect the end result in print at all.</i> <br> <br>To that I would add, and I don't pretend to be an expert on this end of things, mind you. If you are printing offset, you won't see much difference if any. But, it will look different coming out of most laser printers, the outlined version being darker. So I guess what I'm saying is that the difference is a function of the resolution of your output device. I think. <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>> <br> <br>When you convert to outlines, you lose the hinting/instructions of the font. So long as you output the outlines in a high enough resolution, there should be no problem, but if the resolution is low (screen or a sub 600dpi output) you may/will experience a difference.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Truetype fonts might suffer from the same problem, I don't know, but from what I understand, postscript fonts do this because of the way the postscript is handled in a font. <br> <br>As an actual font, only the pixels inside the outline are activated, but when converted to outlines, pixels touching or even sticking outside the outline will be activated; making them appear a little larger.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ever wondered why the "classical" PostScript fonts <br>are called "Type 1" fonts? Because there was a <br>time when you could order fonts in "Type 3" format <br>as well. The difference between these two types is <br>exactly why your text might "bloat" a tiny bit when <br>printed at less than 600dpi after being converted <br>to outlines, as Randy, Eduardo and James <br>correctly pointed out. <br> <br>Type 1 fonts were originally meant for these low <br>to mid-resolution output devices. Taking into <br>account not only this lower resolution but also <br>the ink gain - or should I say "toner spread" - the <br>hinting in these fonts made them slightly thinner <br>in order to compensate for this. Thus when you <br>output Type 1 fonts on film, the characters come <br>out skinnier than the designer intended them to <br>be. That's where Type 3 fonts came in: perfect <br>for high resolution output, but slightly bloated <br>when printed at around 300dpi. For example <br>FF Scala, one of the original FontFonts shipped in <br>both formats at the explicit request of Martin Majoor. <br> <br>So, when you convert your Type 1 font to outlines: <br>no more hinting, so slightly fatter type when output <br>to low to mid resolution.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves, both here and above you say some things that aren't quite right. <br> <br>"Rasterizing" is the process of taking outlines and making a bitmap. All text displayed on screen or in almost any printing process has been rasterized. It's a necessary part of the process of output. <br> <br>Converting text to outlines in Illustrator may or may not affect anti-aliasing on screen, but whether or not the vector display is anti-aliased on screen is completely unrelated to how it turns out in print. <br> <br>The main reason type gets heavier when it is turned into non-font outlinesis that the imaging model is changed. Most font formats (including Type 1, TrueType and OpenType) are normally imaged using a model where pixels or dots are turned on when the center of the pixel/dot is within the outline. The PostScript graphics model turns on pixels/dots when *any part* of the pixel is touched. When you convert a font to graphical outlines, you have made this change in imaging. <br> <br>I believe Yves is right that Type 3 used the graphics imaging model instead of the font imaging model. But this was not an advantage, and meant that the output of Type 3 fonts was less representative of the shape of the outlines at any resolution. It was only obvious and problematic at low resolutions. <br> <br>The loss of hinting in converting Type 1 fonts to outlines will yield inconsistencies in stem thicknesses and other key elements, making them sometimes heavier or lighter than they ought to be, due to rounding errors. Losing hinting does not in fact make the rasterized text any heavier on average, just more inconsistent. It's the change in the imaging model that makes the text heavier. <br> <br>Type 1 fonts were never meant only for low to mid-resolution devices, but were meant to work at any resolution. The problem was that Type 3 fonts, due to their inferior imaging model and lack of hinting, performed poorly at small sizes. <br> <br>It is not true to say that hinting in Type 1 fonts made them image thinner to compensate for toner spread or other device characteristics. Regardless of the effects at low resolution, hinting on Type 1 fonts is essentially irrelevant at very high resolutions (also true for TrueType, btw). <br> <br>The reasons for the existence of Type 3 were twofold: <br> <br>1) Type 3 used the regular PostScript graphics imaging model, and in fact could do anything possible in the PostScript language. So you could have fonts with built-in color, or gradient fills, or random operators (Beowulf). <br> <br>2) Initially Adobe wanted to keep the superior quality of Type 1 to itself, so the Type 1 format is encrypted and was kept secret for a few years. Only the threat of TrueType changed this. <br> <br>BTW, there are a whole bunch of other "Type X" PostScript font formats. I have run into Types 1, 2, 3, 14 and 42, but there are plenty of others. <br> <br>I hope this clarifies things a bit. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Right. Remember how I was mentioning the flexibility that meant that you could do *anything* in Type 3? That same flexibility means that you pretty much need full-fledged PostScript to render Type 3. ATM does not render Type 3 on screen. <br> <br>On Classic Mac OS, you can throw a Type 3 font into the system fonts folder, and it's just like using Type 1 fonts without ATM -- the bitmap screen font is used on screen, and the font only prints at full rez if you have a PostScript output device. <br> <br>Windows doesn't have any reasonable way of working with Type 3 fonts. I don't know about OS X, although I rather suspect they don't work there, either. <br> <br>Under some circumstances, you'll find that fonts get embedded in PDFs as Type 3. PDF only uses Type 3 as a way of handling bitmap fonts, in situations where it can't do an outline font format. AFAIK PDF does not handle the *general* case of Type 3. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>I could be wrong on that score -- perhaps Type 3 ends up in PDF whenever you have Type 3 in the input stream. Maybe somebody who has a copy of Beowulf or something on a classic Mac can do an experiment? <br> <br>I just know that the main causes of having Type 3 in a PDF today seem to be (1) PDFs created on Unix where the input font was a Type 3 bitmap, or (2) PDFs created from Asian-language fonts whose makers do not want outlines to be embedded in PDF, but do allow bitmaps to be created from those outlines. <br> <br>Leastways, that's my impression. I have to say that this is skating on the edge of my knowledge in this area, and I should go off and ask people who would really know about Type 3 in PDF. I'll do that next week, time permitting. <br> <br>T</div>
