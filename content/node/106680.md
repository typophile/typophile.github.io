body: "At any rate, Efficiency Maine has just announced a wide range of incentives
  designed to reduce both energy demand and heating costs. Pellet stove purchasers
  will receive a $250 rebate provided the stove is EPA-approved and makeup air is
  ducted into the unit. Homeowners installing heat pumps or efficient new gas, propane,
  or oil furnaces will receive $500 rebates. The first 50 homeowners to install pellet
  boilers meeting HUD Energy Saver standards\u2014or geothermal heat\u2014will receive
  a $5,000 rebate, which is approximately the incentive amount that has proved most
  effective in selling pellet boilers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur industry up here obviously hopes
  that this incentive, sales force enthusiasm, the media advertising being done by
  one boiler firm\u2014Maine Energy Systems\u2014promoting pellet heat in general,
  and word-of-mouth recognition of our product quality will get us into a sharply
  upward flight path.\r\n"
