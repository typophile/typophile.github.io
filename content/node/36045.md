  body: 'I like it, it''s a nice synthesis of uncial and roman styles.  I would, however,
    re-do the ''a'' as it looks more like a lowercase lambda than an ''a.''  The current
    shape would make a great lambda,  btw. '

  body: "Thank you guys! The \"a\" is really close to \"lambda\" and I did not realize
    that before. But I'm not sure about the real size of this problem. Maybe it can
    make an interesting relation to greek culture also that I was not expecting for.
    I'm sending an image with some calligraphic styles that I was based when I designed
    letter \"a\".\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/references-for-a_4560.gif]"

  body: "In the first two examples, the left-hand diagonal joins the right-hand one
    near the top.  In the third example, the left diagonal is two strokes, almost
    like in a 'k', and in the fourth, it's a very reduced bowl. To my eye, these details
    distinguish these four 'a' styles from a lambda.  \r\n\r\nThe fundamental characteristic
    of lambda is the two diagonal strokes, the left one meeting the right at about
    its halfway point.  This is what makes your 'a' look like lambda, and it doesn't
    have any other details that make it look less like lambda.\r\n\r\nOf course, do
    what you like.  I still think the font looks great. :)"

  body: "Thank you very much, Matt.\r\n\r\nI just made a small research for greek
    types and what I saw is that minuscule 'lambda' always have an accender. Something
    like a rotated 'y'. So, in the situation when we isolate my latter 'a' I agree
    with you that it looks like a lambda, but when we see it in a text (context),
    I think it is difficult not to read it as an 'a'. I was really thinking about
    that, so I made what could be a minuscule lambda in this typographic style. Please,
    tell me what you think about it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roman-greek_4781.gif]"

  body: "I would still move the join a bit more to the top of the letter. And have
    no confusion afterwards.\r\n\r\nAnd btw: you've made very nice design so far."
