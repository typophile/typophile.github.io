body: I just spend the afternoon looking at two 'books of Hours' for 15th Century
  Flanders/Belgium. The illumination was so interesting it was really hard to keep
  my focus on m primary goal of noticing contextual letter alterations. Photos from
  the visit will go up on Flickr at some point including the Lombardic Caps, strawberries
  & snails.
