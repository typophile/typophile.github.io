  occasionally there appears a long y or Y. But although AEIOU macrons are found in
  most faces, Y seems not to have made the standard list.\r\n\r\nI only know of 3
  faces (all Adobe) that contain Ymacron and ymacron: Arno, Garamond Premier, and
  Minion. Can anyone suggest others?"

    contain Ymacron/ymacron (and the five other vowel macrons) - but they are mostly
    display types... ;)

    macrons...\r\n\r\nThat said, typefaces known for extensive language support include
    Andron and SIL fonts."

  body: You must search specimens from Pro fonts. Newzald, Greta Text, Vesper and
    Minion are examples of good Pro fonts with Ymacron and ymacron.
