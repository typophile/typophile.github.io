  body: Yes, you should go on. But i think you&#39;d have to have an roman to go with
    it.  <BR> <BR>I like the fatness of the type. And the way you digitized it. Although
    you&#39;ll hve to do a little about spacing and kerning. &#40;you could try to
    base those on leadtype, no kerning?&#41; If you want to claen the forms up, beware
    of not loosing of loosing the vitality it has now. <BR> <BR>For modern use, you
    might want to have a small &#39;s&#39; &#40;or not!&#41; <BR> <BR>--Jacques <BR>

  body: 'The small s is also traditional, and should be part of the font. It was used
    as a final s, and perhaps also as initial s - I don&#39;t remember. The long s
    was dropped after the French revolution, I believe. '

  body: 'Thanks for the comments! <BR> <BR>to jacques: if i wanna make like Aldus
    the Caps has to be roman. So he dont italiced the caps rigt? maby hav to try with
    the AdobeAldus... <BR>Spacing and Kerning... hmmm view my other typedesign and
    you will see this is one think that I really have to learn. But i will try also
    to overtoke it from the original. <BR> <BR>To William and jacques: Of course a
    &#34;short s&#34; comes... Are there chances to embed it with a Opentype feature?
    <BR> <BR>BTW: I must made many more ligatures for this. But what will happan if
    make somesthink like this: &#34;fi&#34; and &#34;ie&#34;  What if both ligaturs
    are after another in one word?? <BR> <BR>Okay thanks for the comments... mabye
    some more? <BR> <BR>Greets Jens'

    look exaggeratedly heavier than the other characters, to me. And &#34;a&#34; is
    too small? <BR> <BR>About your ligature question &#40;&#34;fi&#34; and &#34;ie&#34;&#41;:
    maybe you should just design a &#34;fie&#34; ligature? ;-&#41;'

  body: This is a beautiful design, and it has <BR>quite a bit of potential. <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t think it needs a companion roman, <BR>necessarily. Aldine italics
    were meant <BR>to function independently. It&#39;s only relatively <BR>recently
    that we have begun to pair them <BR>with roman fonts. <BR> <BR>I also think that
    a bold version would go <BR>against the spirit of the face. This design <BR>could
    easily stand alone as either a text <BR>or a display face. <BR> <BR>I agree with
    you that the caps should probably <BR>take either a roman or sloped roman form.
    I&#39;d <BR>encourage you to try an upright roman first <BR>for the caps to see
    how it works. <BR> <BR>I also agree that you should design a short &#34;s&#34;
    <BR>for beginning and ending letters of words. <BR> <BR>As for ligatures, I say
    design as many as seem <BR>to suggest themselves. You should definitely <BR>include
    a full range of &#34;f&#34; ligatures &#40;&#34;fb&#34;, &#34;ff&#34;, <BR>&#34;ffi&#34;,
    &#34;ffj&#34;, &#34;ffl&#34;, &#34;fft&#34;, &#34;fh&#34;, &#34;fi&#34;, &#34;fj&#34;,
    &#34;fk&#34;, &#34;fl&#34;, and &#34;ft&#34;&#41;, <BR>as well as &#34;c&#34;
    ligatures &#40;&#34;ch&#34;, &#34;ck&#34;, &#34;ct&#34;, etc.&#41; <BR>and &#34;s&#34;
    ligatures with long and short &#34;s&#34;. <BR>You might also consider a &#34;Th&#34;
    ligature, <BR>as well as ligatures for the article adjectives, <BR>common prepositions
    and conjunctions <BR>&#40;The, &#34;the&#34;, &#34;An&#34;, &#34;an&#34;, &#34;Le&#34;,
    &#34;le&#34;, &#34;La&#34;, &#34;la&#34;, <BR>&#34;El&#34;, &#34;el&#34;, &#34;From&#34;,
    &#34;from&#34;, &#34;And&#34;, &#34;and&#34;, <BR>&#34;&amp;c&#34;, &#34;etc.&#34;,
    etc.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0>  &#41; <BR> <BR>I also wouldn&#39;t change the &#34;a&#34; very much,
    <BR>as it looks nice to my eye, and seems to fit <BR>the spirit of the Aldine
    italic. <BR> <BR>Best of luck. This could be a great font. <BR> <BR>David

  body: I love that outsized S... sweet! I agree with David that a Roman isn&#39;t
    necessary. Just have fun and don&#39;t worry about what other people think you
    HAVE to have in it. Worry about what you want to have. If you want to have a bitmap
    of a rodeo clown as part of your font, do it up!

  body: 'The way you have gotten the soft, antique look without lumpy outlines is
    great. Spacing seems to be a particular challenge with this style. Did the original
    have a lot of ligatures with the long &#39;s&#39;? These may be necessary for
    good spacing. '
