    Pretty convinced it's hand-done. Take the quarter top part of /O and you could
    rebuilt all letters quite easily.\r\nAlternative: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/faddish|Faddish]]"

    you this link first. My fault ;)"

  body: "On their website, L\u2019Exception use a webfont called \u2018LException-Normal\u2019.
    I don\u2019t know who created it, but I think you can safely assume that it was
    custom-made, just like the (taller, but similar) typeface in your sample."

  body: "No problem and thanks for linking to L'Exception. They actually use a bespoke
    typeface called 'Exception' (see image below) which shares the same design backbone
    with your sample though not matching. Your sample is narrower and some adjustments
    (mainly on /B) have been done to make it more contrasted and more symmetric, essentially
    to emphase resemblance between 'LOOK' and 'BOOK', being the mirror of each other.
    Still believing it has been created from scratch, too many type design errors:
    inconsistent x-height over glyph set (/C looks too large comparing to the other
    letters), poor kerning, no optical correction...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_5068.png]"

  body: Another "way" to reproduce it would be to start with some narrow ultra contrasted
    sans/serif and reconstruct some letters to match your sample. A good candidate
    would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/niagara|Niagara]], chopping
    off the serifs and recreating /K from /B.
