  body: "My guess is that it's custom, as most logos are. Marc's suggestion of Magnesium
    is good, and I also found <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeassociates/fremantle/\">Fremantle
    Black</a> as another possible alternative. The G is not as rounded and closed
    as the GIANT EAGLE logo, but the strokes are uneven and at least the G is the
    right style of 'jaw'.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
