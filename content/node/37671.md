body: "I would like to announce the release of CR8type version 2.1\r\nThis is a minor
  update. The following features have been added in this version (2.1):\r\n\r\n- OpenType
  tables can now be retained to allow editing of OpenType TT fonts.\r\n- all name
  ID\u2019s be accessed, including those belonging to OpenType specs.\r\n- edit all
  OpenType metrics and description entries in required tables.\r\n- now faster opening
  very large (over 10,000 glyph) TrueType fonts (2 to 15 times faster than FontLab
  & AsiaFont Studio).\r\n- effectivly no limit on the number of points per glyph,
  so complex images (eg signatures) can be traced using CR8tracer.\r\n- and some minor
  bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAllan Murray\r\nCR8 Software Solutions\r\n[[http://www.cr8software.net/type.html]]\r\n"
