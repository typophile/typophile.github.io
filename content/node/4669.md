body: I&#39;m currently designing a typeface using an EM square of 2048 points &#40;the
  standard used in TT-fonts&#41;. Will my typeface suffer any problems if I were to
  change this to an EM square of 2000 points, as this fits better with my requirements.

  body: An sfnt font &#40;TTF, OTF&#41; can have an em square of any size. There is
    a gain in performance speed if the em square is a power of 2, hence 2048 being
    the most common standard, but this is not a requirement of the specification.
    Note, however, that some customers, e.g. Microsoft, make a power of 2 a procurement
    requirement because of the performance gain. From what I understand, this performance
    gain is pretty small, but MS consider it significant enough to be desirable.

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;This is one of those cases
    where an ancient issue has become almost religious belief. <BR> <BR>Adobe&#39;s
    testing has never shown any performance difference based on an em square being
    a power of 2. I&#39;ve never seen Microsoft point to any testing that demonstrated
    it such a performance difference, despite being asked. <BR> <BR>The original expectation
    &#40;and likely reality&#41; of a performance difference for TrueType outlines
    was specific to the 68K Motorola series of processors, and byte-shifting operation
    optimization within those processors. This rationale does not transfer to PowerPC
    or Intel processors. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;ve never seen a claimed performance
    difference for PostScript outlines, though it would seem to be just as probable
    &#40;or improbable today&#41;. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T&#60;/font&#62;'
