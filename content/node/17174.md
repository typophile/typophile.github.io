  body: The shapes are very simple and the negative space in pol is much larger than
    krono. Since there aren't any other words I could believe its either a modified
    typeface or hand drawn. I doubt a type designer would make the disparity between
    the outline pol and the regular krono.

  body: "mde, I got my hands on other logos of this Krono group. It seems that it
    really is a modified face after all, as the letters in other logos look +/- the
    same, but small differences (presence/absence of round corners and such) give
    away that they've been made by different people at various times to match the
    logo of the mother company more or less. So I decided to modify the funny Futura
    to match the letters. \r\n\r\nAs for Dan's comment on the stroking of the Pol
    part of the logo - this is what usually happens when you just hit \"stroke\" in
    the Illustrator without other tinkerings with the result. The person who did it
    probably was on a hurry or didn't give it any thought at all.. I wonder how Czechs
    have managed to have their beautiful Storm foundry, when Eastern Europe overall
    is a huge territory of typographical ignorance... (usual rant, but I'm not very
    educated myself, so I'm really not the one to throw the first stone)\r\n\r\nI
    am \"designing\" a logo for a company this Krono group has acquired recently (ie.
    my task is to make just another one based on the sample) and have some questions
    about it too, but I will upload it to the Design section."

  body: "I found what might be the \"mother\" typeface for this variant in the 1972
    directory of VGC Typositor headline fonts. There's a small group of condensed
    block letters with rounded corners which look very similar and they are simply
    called \"Glyphic Series\".\r\n\r\nOf course this is all pre-digital and of no
    hope to you at the moment. Sorry. :-("

  body: "Hopefully you still check on this thread. I've come across a monospace, condensed
    typeface similar to Glyphic Neue, but it looks more like the original sample.
    Its called Garland Monospace. Look for it at www.industrial-organic.net.\r\n\r\nAlso
    check out some of the other typographic treatments, and the Herb Lubalin tributes,
    definitely a new take on the retro type.\r\n\r\n-meta"

    take a closer look on works of Herb Lubalin. I need time, more time! :)
