  the places I usually would, including the Sans Guide, MyFonts, FontShop and Veer.
  I have had no luck finding an exact match. The colored lettering is what I am trying
  to find.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, \r\n\r\n- Mike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/squarishMystery6_2010_6101.gif]"

    asking about the same font, but these samples are a bit clearer and show a few
    more letters. \r\n\r\nOne idea I had in looking at this is that it's sort of like
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/amplitude/\">Amplitude</a> without
    the ink traps.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think the spacing is not up to Christian Schwartz's standards. The W especially
    seems overkerned with the O. Looking at the sample of Amplitude Headline, the
    G here with its vertically sheared terminal looks quite different. Also the leg
    of R here seems to join the bowl further away from the stem than in Amplitude.\r\n\r\nMike,
    did your search include free fonts? The G suggests to me the designer didn't quite
    know about stroke thinning at the spur."

    thought this looked too 'professional' for a search of the free fonts, but I will
    look now that you raised the issue.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    every freebie I saw.  Maybe someone tweaked a commercial font? Still think Amplitude
    is at least a good substitute -- it would have fooled me, for what that's worth.\r\n\r\n-

    other freebie sites that could be suggested as mostly legit freebies that are
    similarly searchable?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    goose chase. Hmm, a tricky one. Where did the sample come from?

    using 'Castleman' as his user name from the other thread. He seemed happy enough
    with the Amplitude Headline answer, even though it seems not to be exact. I presume
    he wanted an ID because his client wanted something using this same font.\r\n\r\n-
