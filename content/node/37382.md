body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI recently posted a sample of a font that I said I'd been
  seeing around everywhere. Someone (correctly) identified that font as Dear Sarah.
  I realized today that Dear Sarah wasn't the one I've been seeing all over the place,
  it's the one on the sample here, the script font on the word Communications. Got
  any ideas?"

    and enlarged it. I think that might have been what was tripping me up. Thanks
    for the link. '
