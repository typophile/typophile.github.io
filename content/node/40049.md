body: "Hi,\r\nI have a file in inDesign that I need to send to a publisher in pdf
  format. But when I output it (using print to pdf), the 100% black gets spread over
  all the cmy plates as well. I have color management turned off, but can't seem to
  find what I need to change to stop this.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: It is just the default black in the swatches, I think. But it shows as c0
    m0 y0 k100, and when I look at the "Seperations Preview" in inDesign, all the
    art shows up only on the black plate-which is what I want. But when I print to
    pdf and then look at Output Preview the art shows up on all four plates.

    CMYK, or CMYK to RGB and back again or something. Are you generating your PDF
    through the "Print..." dialog, or "Save as...", or "Export..."? '

  body: "Firstly turn on colour management in Bridge (so that the settings are synchronised
    across CS applications). Choose the Prepress setting for your territory. Now don't
    print and distil to make the PDF, but use the export menu in InDesign. Choose
    the PDF X-1a setting and you are golden.\r\n\r\nDoing it this way ensures that
    untagged CMYK or grey colour values defined in InDesign goes unchanged to the
    PDF. Make sure your document is converted to the new colour settings you are using,
    and check to see that all elements are now tagged with the correct colour: K=100\r\n\r\nChanging
    the appearance of black in the preferences has no effect on the values in the
    PDF, it only changes how black is show on your screen."
