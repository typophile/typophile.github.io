body: "I've been working with a font family (that I love) for some time now, but it's
  limited to the traditional book typography variations: roman, SC, italic, bold (all
  with lining and old style figures). It would be immensely helpful if there were,
  say, a bold italic...and perhaps even a bold SC. It would probably also make the
  family more enticing to other designers, to be honest.* How realistic is it to approach
  the designer of the original directly and try to commission them to expand the family?
  Would current distributors of the family need to approve? I realize that it depends
  heavily on the specific designer's willingness, and how much one is willing to spend,
  but I'm very curious. I also have little to no idea what the typical cost of a project
  like this is. Licensing exclusivity is not an issue.\r\n\r\nI had the idea recently,
  and it may be too pie-in-the-sky to be realistic, but I'd like to get a sense as
  to whether there's any precedent and if there would be thorny legal issues. I'd
  appreciate any informed thoughts on the subject. I'd like to make it a reality,
  but for now it's purely a hypothetical.\r\n\r\n\r\n*I have no idea how well the
  family is selling."

  body: "If the designer is still alive I'd agree that this is your best first step.
    Your best second step is to approach the foundry and read the EULA. If the EULA
    allows modifications and/or derivatives you shouldn't have any problems. However,
    even then most foundries who do allow mods and derivs allow it only for in house
    use, ergo not for resale. So, that takes you back to the first two steps. \r\n\r\nSo,
    you aren't going to tell us the font?"

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nDo contact the designer and plead for your case. If the distributer
    isn't interested to expand the family, The designer can sell you a customized
    version himself. Should be no legal problem as long as you, the designer and the
    distributor have a dialogue. Allthough the typface is licenced to some distributor,
    the designer owns the design itself.\r\n\r\nGood luck."

    helpful by mentioning to the guy at Letterhead (Chuck, I think) that none of the
    fonts I was looking at had full character sets, and some people might be turned
    off by that (not sure if he's corrected this since then) and he offered to fill
    out the characters sets of any fonts I bought.\r\n\r\nIt's probably a lot like
    life, some people will try and be helpful, and some people will rain on your parade. "

    Extra Bold for even more extra bold impact in my designs!\r\n\r\nBut seriously,
    I'm hesitant to say which family, as I know the designer has been/is on Typophile,
    and I don't want to start a thing in public before approaching them directly.
    But I'd say it's a safe bet that you could figure it out pretty easily with a
    little effort."
