    body: The group will run a college radio station, hold live music events, have
      student websites etc. basically anything 'media' related, so the logo would
      be used on videos, web, print and possibly t-shirts. We don't want horrible
      logos or fonts you usually get with things like this. The look should be a professional/corporate
      style.

  body: Maybe restrict yourself some of the fonts that come freely bundled with a
    PC or Mac? They'll give you a reasonable range of letterforms to base a logo on,
    especially on the Mac. If you're using a package like Creative Suite that comes
    bundled with a fairly decent collection of additional fonts.

    free fonts? Most of the people here are professionals, and know that some (not
    all or even most) free fonts can be defective and cause software to malfunction.\r\n\r\nI
    have heard dozens of stories of people downloading hundreds or thousands of free
    fonts and discovering that Photoshop or other programs no longer will load. All
    it takes is one badly built font. And finding the bad one in 100 is a chore. Finding
    it in 1000 or more is a ridiculous amount of work, and would make you sorry that
    you didn't spend $22 or more to buy a quality font."

    body: We would love to be able to buy a good font and there are a lot we have
      looked at, some fairly cheap and others a little more expensive, like FF Cocon,
      Info Display and FS Sophie, but we just can't afford to buy any we like, so
      we have no choice but to try and find a good free font until we can afford to
      buy one. I have tried designing a font before and got no-where, as well as taking
      an existing font and trying to customize it, but that turned out awful.

    fonts are fine. There are some very good ones, actually (see the link to the WIKI
    above). Of course, there are infinitely more good commercial fonts...many quite
    affordable. \r\n\r\nHowever, we need to know more about what you are looking for
    before we could even begni suggesting anything specific. You said 'corporate'.
    That, alone, isn't a whole lot to go off of. Lot's of corporations use Helvetica
    and Times which came with your machine. If you're looking for something else,
    try to give us a bit more info if you can as to what you are specifically looking
    for."

  body: "Hello:\r\n\r\nActually your drawing is not that bad... keep going- keep perfecting.
    Push comes to shove: the 'rough/irregular' look is highly desirable these days.
    But if its not working for you, try it once or twice more, then you need to move
    on to modifying exsisting type so you don't fail the assignment or run out of
    time. If you simply don't have the money that's okay. There are good free fonts
    out there but you have to look. FontShop being no. 1 on the list. And I would
    definately check out Maniakers. Look at the (mentionaed) Free faq on typophile.
    Also you need to have the concept down first. That will help. So when you go font
    hunting you know what to look for.\r\n\r\nBTW...Don McCahill your comments are
    so false. There are many excellent free fonts out there. You just have to look
    (sometimes really hard). FontBook (or other 3rd party utility) checks for errors
    and stops you from installing bad fonts so that argument is out... you are using
    Mac OS X right? If your 'friends' are unwise enough to install hundreds or thousands
    of fonts (free or otherwise), have them all activated, and not even validate them
    they must NOT be a professional.\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Diaz\r\n\r\nPS... Also I think
    Stefan H (MacRhino) is awesome for offering a discount- I think thats very nice
    of you guy!"

  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI got a question that sort of relates to what is being discussed
    here.\r\nI'm working on a logo for a fashion designer that makes anything from
    wedding dresses to very modern ladies shirts, skirts, etc.\r\nI want to use custom
    fonts for her logo, but like Chronix I'm not that comfortable creating my own
    font. What my question is whether it it's ok to create a new font from exsisting
    fonts and then to tweak it that it looks as I want...or is that kinda like stealing?
    I would have to change it a bit in illustrator to make it all fit and to make
    it look natural..but still the main parts would be stolen from 2 other fonts.\r\n\r\nnext
    question...what can I use better: Illustrator or fontlab? I know Illustrator very
    well (worked on it for about 5 years now) and don't know much about fontlab (I
    have played around with it but seemed a bit complicated, or is that just because
    I don't have a lot of practice yet?).\r\n\r\nOfcourse if you all say to create
    one myself without any other fonts as base I will do that...but I was just wondering.\r\n\r\n\\tnx

    something new on something old is considered stealing, but from what I've seen
    it actually happens a lot.\r\nI started working on a font & I'm using Illustrator
    (since I'm also very familiar with it) & Fontographer, but this combinaton leaves
    a lot to be desired. I haven't used Fontlab, but I do think it's most commonly
    used in designing typefaces. You'll probably be able to import Illustrator drawn
    letters in Fontlab as well.\r\nGood luck!"

    a typeface to your design to improve on spacing and letterforms and is probably
    the most effective way of achieving it as somebody else (the type designer) will,
    with their knowledge and experience, have worked out a lot of the problems of
    stroke modulation etc. If your intention is just to create a logo rather than
    take a font change it and then use it as a font you are on safe moral ground is
    my perspective. And to that end I would just work in Illustrator.\r\nTry it and
    if you want to get some opinions post it in the Critique section.\r\nTim\r\n\r\nps
