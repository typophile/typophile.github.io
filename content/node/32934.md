    if I were you. \r\n\r\nBut, from a communications standpoint, an icon is a signifier
    that resembles what is signified. For example, the icon of a telephone on a phonebooth
    obviously resembles what can be found inside. \r\n\r\nA symbol is an arbitrary
    signifier for something. For example, $ is a random mark that obviously doesn't
    look like a dollar. \r\n\r\nA logotype, well, duh.\r\n\r\nSo in my opinion, a
    logotype is most approriate when the name of the company/product/etc. says what
    the company/product/etc. does.\r\n\r\nAn icon works the same way: if you can look
    at an icon and know what it represents, it could work as a stand alone. For example,
    Expedia's suitcase icon obviously represents travel.\r\n\r\nA symbol is arbitrary
    and, in my opinion, not be used alone as a logo unless the company/product/etc.
    is well established. If you see a red \"+\" then you can assume it stands for
    the Red Cross, but reverse it and it is the Swiss symbol, make it blue and it's
    an insurance company, etc...\r\n\r\nSo to answer in short - it all depends what
    the logo is for and how it will be used. Are you asking for a specific reason
    or just curious?"

  body: "Scott that was an excellent response. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I could add
    is If you're deciding WHEN to use an icon with a logo. Has the logo/company been
    established to the audience prior to seeing any symbols/icons? Is the icon an
    established symbol that's recognizable by anyone (i.e. to steal Scott's example:
    a telephone) or is it an uncommon icon developed exclusively for the company/logo
    (like a concept)? If it's the former, you probably don't need to present the company/logo
    prior to showing the icon, but if it's the latter; you might need to present the
    company/logo to create the necessary connections/concept for the icon to become
    apparent.\r\n\r\nUltimately it's not a cut and dry, do this or do that, solution. "
