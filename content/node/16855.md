  FontMaster Light. Are there any of you with experience using both of these tools?
  Is there anything in, especially, BezierMaster that is particularly useful in comparison?
  I have some experience with FontLab 3.0 (and FontForge) but I am basically new to
  both of these high-end tools.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nIdris\r\n\r\n"
