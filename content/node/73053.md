body: "I'm having issues with the kearning between the 'K' and 'O' in this logo project
  and I'm hoping a fresh set of eyes can help me out. Does it need to be tightened
  up a hair more?  Also, any other feedback regarding the kearning would be great.
  \r\n\r\nThe logo is just about final after a LONG process, so I only need help with
  the letterspacing.\r\n\r\n'KOURY' is set in DIN Black. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: To be perfectly honest I think the kerning (tracking) is fine :) I think if
    you tightened it it would look more even at the top but would then make it awkwardly
    close at the bottom so I would leave it as it is.

  body: "I am not a professional, but I would say that the \xBBO\xAB looks smaller
    than the other characters; the upper and lower arcs should shoot over the upper
    and base line \u2013 same problem with the \xBBU\xAB, the lower arc should end
    below the base line. Else it looks like those two characters are floating \u2026\r\nThose
    are the things that irritate me, but the kerning should be just fine.\r\n\r\nHope
    you understand what I wrote, I am from Germany hence not a native English speaker."

  body: Upon a second look I think Alexej may be right, especially with the O. It
    almost looks like it is being eaten by the K. A minor change can fix this :) as
    Alexej said previously.

  body: "Alexej + tdabner:\r\n\r\nThanks for the discerning eyes.  I've attached a
    grid shot of 'KOURY' set in DIN Black. The 'O' and 'U' do extend below the baseline,
    but only a by a hair.  \r\n\r\nSuggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/koury_grid_5254.png]"

  body: Maybe increase this by a hair still? I'm not sure, after seeing the grid and
    looking back at the original I can see that it extends slightly, but I couldn't
    see this before you pointed it out so it's maybe still something to consider.

  body: "Now that you both mention it, I can see how the 'O' and 'U' look smaller
    than the rest of the letters. I am going to try tweeking the letterforms so it
    looks optically correct. Let me know what you think of the 2 new options.\r\n\r\n1.
    Original\r\n2. O & U extended vertically\r\n3. O & U extended vertically more\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Agreed.  \r\n\r\nSomething was driving me a little crazy with this logo,
    and I thought it was just the kearning... but I guess it was optically off because
    of the O & U. \r\n\r\nThank you both again for all your help! I truly appreciate
    it."
