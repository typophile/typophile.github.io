body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nThis is my first post, I'm a designer and for several years
  I am interested in typedesign, I'm not a typedesigner but I try.\r\n\r\nGr\xF6\xDFe
  is my first real project, and is a project that I'm working on for some years.\r\n<strong>Gr\xF6\xDFe</strong>
  <cite>(Grosse)</cite> in german  means \"big-large\". The design of the font is
  inspired by the northern european architecture, with its clean lines, modula, simple
  and squared.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/grossefont?a=1622516\"\r\nTitle=\"Link
  to Grosse\"><img\r\nsrc=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/024/755/c63577b88d278f765d02987a7fac880a_large.jpg?1339414055\"\r\nalt=\"Link
  to Grosse\"></a>\r\n\r\nWhene I started designing it I thought of something that
  could be used on posters and at wide boy, the geometric shapes and the solid structure
  makes it a very good choice to make posters.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to to make it compatible
  with many languages \u200B\u200Bas possible, also cyrillic and if it's possibile
  chinese, the Chinese could be useful?\r\n\r\nThank you all.\r\nCritics are welcome!\r\n\r\n<cite>If
  you want to help my project</cite>\r\nhttp://www.indiegogo.com/grossefont?a=1622516"

    your ONLY project ever - It will take your whole lifetime. I'd stick to European
    if I were you.

    make {\u03A3} a bit more distinct from {E}, they currently look very much alike.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    <em>Gr\xF6\xDFe</em> is a noun meaning \"size; greatness\", not an adjective."

  body: "Thank you Catharsis,\r\n\r\nThere are three versions, I still prefer the
    second.\r\nBecause the type has less oblique lines as possible.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schermata-2013-04-24-alle-09_6278.51.jpg]\r\nHave
    you more suggestions?\r\n\r\nAbout the name you're right, I used the term in an
    evocative way.\r\n\r\nLeo"
