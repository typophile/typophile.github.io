  font used in the masthead a custom font or is it available? \r\nI know Shepard Fairey
  uses it on his agency Studio number one site, and he is part founder of Swindle
  Magazine. \r\n\r\n\r\nthanks for your help. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Swindle_5104.jpg]"

  body: "Well, if this is custom, and it seems likely that it is, it would not be
    too hard to put this together from pieces of letters, and/or letters with lines
    drawn through them. Do they use this 'font' for more than the masthead and 'STUDIO
    NUMBER ONE'? If not, these may be the only letters that exist. (Notice there are
    two different N's, between the two logos).\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: Given that there is so much hand-drawn type in every issue and the fact that
    Fairey's background is street art, I am guessing that this is custom and he had
    a major hand in it himself.
