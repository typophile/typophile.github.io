  body: 'Here&#39;s my take. The law is clear that typefaces themselves cannot be
    copyrighted in the US. I have heard suggestions that some European countries differ.
    Bitmap images of fonts are absolutely not copyrightable, and representing a font
    as a data structure containing bezier control points is almost certainly not copyrightable.
    This state of affairs seems to be the desire of the typesetter industry. If one
    were cynical, one might suggest that they simply want to avoid having to pay any
    sorts of royalties to font designers. <BR> <BR>The trick that font distributors
    have used to get around this quirk of copyright law is to treat the digital representation
    of fonts not as pure data, but as a <i>computer program</i> which, when executed,
    draws the actual glyphs. <BR> <BR>For most popular font formats today, this legal
    fiction has some basis in reality. Metafont fonts and TrueType instructions unarguably
    have many of the characteristics of computer programs. I consider PostScript Type1
    to be a bit cloudier. Originally, this font format was mostly treated as a &#40;somewhat
    trivial&#41; PostScript program and typically rendered by executing it in a PostScript
    interpreter. However, in practice the programming features are so restricted that
    it is arguably a data structure rather than a true programming language, and many
    Type1 renderers simply extract the charstrings and skip over any real PostScript
    code that happens to be embedded. <BR> <BR>But, for legal purposes, good enough.
    Type1 fonts are programs, sure. And, fast-forwarding to today, the &#34;features&#34;
    in OpenType &#40;even the PS outline variants&#41; are arguably complex and sophisticated
    enough to be software rather than just data. <BR> <BR>So how did Adobe and Emigre
    win? First, keep in mind that they settled, so there&#39;s still no real judicial
    decision. Second, from what I can see the &#34;infringing&#34; fonts were not
    new outlines of the same basic shapes, but were generated by extracting the Bezier
    outlines. This gets you into the murky waters of what constitutes a &#34;derivative
    work&#34;. <BR> <BR>Quick summary, then: typefaces are not copyrightable, but
    for all practical purposes large corporations with teams of highly-paid lawyers
    can pretend they are.'

  body: '<i>...representing a font as a data structure containing bezier control points

    hold forth on such matters, at least do your homework. Some of us have spent many
    long hours studying the decisions of the US Copyright Office and specific cases.
    <BR> <BR>There was indeed a judicial decision in the Adobe, Emigre etc. vs. SSi
    case: a summary judgement on the basis of which SSi decided to settle since it
    was clear that Judge White had determined that the plaintiffs&#39; arguments had
    merit. In the summary judgement, Judge White specifically determined that the
    placing of outline points was non-arbitrary and constituted an authorial act that
    was properly subject to copyright. He made this decision within the framework
    of the 1992 Copyright Office decision on the protectability of font software,
    noting that the interaction of outline definition and hinting to produce a specific
    result met the requirements of software copyright.'

    little about the primary discoursive mode of this board? If not, maybe I&#39;ve
    misunderstood. <BR> <BR>Seriously, thanks for the clarification on the Adobe,
    Emigre vs. SSi case. Most of my info comes from this <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pfs/essay2.html">excellent
    review</a> by Paul Schaffner. Now that I look more closely, that review is almost
    10 years old, and while I don&#39;t believe the law has changed much since then,
    I can certainly see how more recent decisions such as SSi can change its interpretation.
