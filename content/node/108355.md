    and [[http://www.ffonts.net/Oak-Wood.font|Oak Wood]] which digits look to match...
    But can''t state about their legitimacy... '

  body: "Oak Wood has an earlier internal font date and its numbers are in same style
    as its alphabet. Pompeii Caps has a different style alphabet and, when adjusted
    to same scale as Oak Wood [i.e. reduced 91.892%], its numbers and other non alphabet
    characters are a point for point match with Oak Wood. I suggest Oak Wood is probably
    an original work -- I have not seen it elsewhere -- and Pompeii Caps is a copy,
    except for the uppercase letters A to Z.\r\nDon"

  body: "Info on the author of Oak Wood as of 2008 from http://www.fontage.com/foundry/jpearson.html\r\n\"I
    am the original author and creator of these fonts. From 1991 to around 1994, I
    made these typefaces as a labor of love... a little money here and there from
    the (then, before the internet made a big splash on the world) shareware world.\"\r\n\"Today,
    I've updated these typefaces to show my web and email addresses. I've not changed
    anything about the designs - errors and foibles still present :-). My typefaces
    are interesting, unique, and original... perhaps not Foundry material (doesn't
    bother me)... just good clean font fun for the family!\"\r\nLink to his website
