  but I've been unable to find out\u2026\r\nDoes anybody have any information about
  the renaming of Cheltenham Old Style, which became Gloucester (series 99) in 1911
  for British Monotype ? Thank you very much."

    had several imitators, as follows: The Monotype version was _Gloucester_. It had
    an italic _p_ with the normal closed bowl. Stephenson Blake had _Winchester_,
    which may be distinguished by the curl of the ear in _g_ and the serifs of the
    _s_. Intertype had _Cheltonian_. Berthold originally called their version _Sorbonne_
    [1905].\r\nDon"

    an <cite>imitation</cite> of Cheltenham, since Lanston Monotype (British Monotype\u2019s
    US parent company) had bought the rights of the face from ATF in order to make
    it available on its composing machines. I just wonder why it was thus renamed
    for the British (and European) market, and how the \u2018Gloucester\u2019 name
    came about."

  body: "Since it was the British Monotype company that gave the world Times Roman,
    along with revivals of Baskerville, Plantin, Garamond, and such faces as Bembo
    and Poliphilus, even though it was descended from the original American Lanston
    Monotype company, it seems to have become independent of it. Thus, Lanston Monotype
    faded to such obscurity that it ended up being owned by a participant in this
    forum (one Gerald Giampa), while the British Monotype firm is a very major player
    in the digital type era.\r\n\r\nWhile Lanston Monotype opened its British branch
    in 1897, the British operations issued stock in Britain in 1936, so they became
    independent then or earlier."
