  body: The font is Jukebox &#34;Opulence&#34;, a reincarnation of  a Photolettering
    Script called Zoom Script in the Solotype Catalog. See sample at <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg5.html"

  body: 'Actually, <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=JBT0000035">the
    Jukebox face</a> has more slope to it, and the connecting strokes between the
    characters are quite a bit different. Here&#39;s a sample of the same text set
    in 85pt Opulence: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13747.gif"

  body: I guess I can see what you mean, but it&#39;s obvious Jason used the same
    font as the model for Opulence. That suggests this sample comes from the photolettering
    original, unless you know of another digitization of Zoom Script, which is what
    he said was used to derive Opulence.

  body: Hi Mike - <BR> <BR>I think I should have clarified something in my previous
    post. I wasn&#39;t debating whether or not Jason based Opulence on the older version
    - I think it&#39;s pretty clear that it was used as inspiration somewhere along
    the line. I was just trying to show that there is enough difference between the
    original sample posted by Misa and Opulence to perhaps keep looking for a closer
    match. Opluence certainly displays the right flavour and style. I guess it depends
    on how close to identical the type needs to be.

    the thing with these ID&#39;s: sometimes you  <BR>find something that you might
    consider only  <BR>remotely similar but in the same vein/atmosphere  <BR>and it&#39;s
    OK for the person who requested the ID,  <BR>and sometimes they can keep on bitching
    forever  <BR>about the tapering of one specific serif. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Any which
    way, it&#39;s always helpful to provide near- <BR>matches or even similar choices
    if the exact face  <BR>is not found, but it never hurts to point out any  <BR>dissimilarities
    in case of... <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got the impression this board is getting  <BR>crowded

    and I was pleasantly surprised to find you here,  <BR>helping us out where needed.'

  body: Thanks Yves for the welcome, I was hoping I hadn&#39;t walked into a closed
    little club where I would be ignored until I went away. I&#39;ve been impressed
    by the expertise I&#39;ve read so far, and hope I can make a contribution too.  The
    atmosphere here is a bit different than the newsgroups where I usually participate,
    and it&#39;s nice not having to sift through all the posts to find an ID request
    that has been unanswered. I&#39;m looking forward to participating here.

    still green with envy  <BR>over your legendary 1-minute ID.
