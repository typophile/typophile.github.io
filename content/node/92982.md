  fine with the basic characters, but how do I get this to work with alternates?\r\nI
  got y.ss01, for example. How should the accented character be named?\r\ny.ss01acute,
  y.ss01_acute don\u2019t work.\r\nIs it possible at all? Thanks for your help :)"

  body: "Linus, \r\n\r\nthe alias.dat file that ships with FontLab Studio does not
    include all possible alternate glyph + accent combinations. You can add your own
    composition recipes to alias.dat or you can use the following syntax in FontLab
    Studio's Generate Glyphs dialog: \r\n\r\ny.ss01+acute=yacute.ss01\r\n\r\nBefore
    the equation sign is the recipe, and after the equation sign the desired glyph
    name. \r\n\r\nMore information about the recipe syntax is given in the Generate
    Glyphs dialog and in the manual. "

  body: I save glyph recipes in text files, including ones that use my usual naming
    system. When I need to make some accented characters, I find the ones (or the
    set) I want, and then copy and paste into the Generate Glyphs window in FontLab.

    s.smcp+s.smcp\r\n\tgermandbls f+s ?\r\n\r\n(As for myself, I would expect germandbls.smcp

  body: "Yes, the principal difference is that with +, all components will be placed
    on the advance width of the first component, and with _, the advance width of
    the final glyph will be the sum of the widths of all components. \r\n\r\n\"W_I\"
    will produce a glyph where I is next to W on a width which is a sum of the widths
    of W and I. \"W+I\" will produce a glyph on the width of W with I centered on
    W. \"W+&lt;I\" will produce a glyph on the width of W with I left-aligned with
    W, and \"W+&gt;I\" will produce a glyph on the width of W with I right-aligned
    with W. "

    you might want to be more specific: do you want to create a new font from scratch,
    or make modifications to an existing font? Either way you will need software tools,
    but more importantly training/education not only in how to use the software, but
    in type design."
