  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Okay, so along with the redesign for the magazines I work on, I'm going to rebuild our typefaces (Scala Sans and Scala) as OpenType fonts, to access all the small caps, etc. since we're switching to InDesign. <BR> <BR>I have no idea where to start.. I have been looking through the documentation in FontLab&hellip; it's abyssmal to say the least. I've opened a couple OpenType fonts, only to find a near indecipherable list of code terms for OpenType. <BR> <BR>I had to rebuild this font earlier in the year to unite all the family styles (the original Scala and Scala Sans were all pulled apart so that you don't jump to bold by clicking bold. Because most of the magazine text is written in Word prior to being laid out, it's imperative that the family function works correctly.) So I've got all my metrics, bitmaps, outlines already saved in FontLab, and united as families, but I don't know where to go from there. <BR> <BR>This is the list of functions I want to include: <BR> <BR>Standard ligatures (ff, fi, fl, ffl, ffi) <BR> <BR>Lining numerals <BR> <BR>Non-lining numerals <BR> <BR>Small Caps <BR> <BR>Multiplication Symbol (this is used constantly in my texts, and needs to be present&hellip; can I define a discretionary alternate that says &quot;if number x number&quot; then &quot;number [multiply] number&quot;? There's probably about five or six discretionary rules I'd need to incorporate. <BR> <BR>There's also a set of expert symbols that I'd like to incorporate as alternate/additional characters. <BR> <BR>The range of weights will be regular, regular italic, bold, bold italic, black, black italic. Scala doesn't have a black italic caps, so I'll have to leave that out. <BR> <BR>Basically, I need some guidance. I've not done a lot of coding, and this seems pretty crazy, but if the House Industries guys can learn to do it, so can I!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Urm. I'd love to advise, but FontShop's end user license doesn't permit you to modify their fonts. It reads: <BR> <BR>&quot;You agree not to modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, alter, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software.&quot; <BR> <BR>So you should contact FontShop and let them know you want OpenType versions of the fonts. <BR> <BR>That aside, it would not be at all difficult to add a handful of OpenType features like those you're contemplating. You could indeed do a contextual alternate that substituted a multiplication symbol for an x in the manner you describe. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Anyhow, back to the main question: <BR> <BR>Open the &quot;OpenType&quot; panel in FontLab. The left side lists the OT features, the right side lists the code for the currently selected feature. <BR> <BR>Click on the &quot;+&quot; sign at the bottom left of the OT panel. This adds a feature. The feature will initially be called &quot;xxxx&quot;. <BR> <BR>In the right pane of the panel, you'll see the initial template of the feature code appear. Change the two occurrences of &quot;xxxx&quot; in the right pane &quot; to the feature you want. Let's say lowercase to small caps ('smcp'). <BR> <BR>The remaining line to change and expand on is this one: <BR> <BR>&gt;  sub by ; <BR> <BR>You need to fill that out and duplicate it. Remember you're using glyph names to refer to the glyphs, so you'll need to use the same glyph names you're actually using in your font. A completed smcp feature might look like this: <BR> <BR>feature smcp { <BR>sub a by a.smcp ; <BR>sub b by b.smcp ; <BR>sub c by c.smcp ; <BR>sub d by d.smcp ; <BR>sub e by e.smcp ; <BR>sub f by f.smcp ; <BR>sub g by g.smcp ; <BR>sub h by h.smcp ; <BR>sub i by i.smcp ; <BR>sub j by j.smcp ; <BR>sub k by k.smcp ; <BR>sub l by l.smcp ; <BR>sub m by m.smcp ; <BR>sub n by n.smcp ; <BR>sub o by o.smcp ; <BR>sub p by p.smcp ; <BR>sub q by q.smcp ; <BR>sub r by r.smcp ; <BR>sub s by s.smcp ; <BR>sub t by t.smcp ; <BR>sub u by u.smcp ; <BR>sub v by v.smcp ; <BR>sub w by w.smcp ; <BR>sub x by x.smcp ; <BR>sub y by y.smcp ; <BR>sub z by z.smcp ; <BR>sub b.sans by b.smcp ; <BR>sub d.sans by d.smcp ; <BR>sub h.sans by h.smcp ; <BR>sub i.sans by i.smcp ; <BR>sub j.sans by j.smcp ; <BR>sub k.sans by k.smcp ; <BR>sub l.sans by l.smcp ; <BR>sub m.sans by m.smcp ; <BR>sub n.sans by n.smcp ; <BR>sub p.sans by p.smcp ; <BR>sub r.sans by r.smcp ; <BR>sub u.sans by u.smcp ; <BR>} smcp; <BR> <BR>A completed liga feature might be something like this: <BR> <BR>feature liga { # ligatures on by detault <BR>  sub f f i by ffi ; <BR>  sub f f l by ffl ; <BR>  sub f f by ff ; <BR>  sub f i by fi ; <BR>  sub f l by fl ; <BR>  sub f j by f_j ; <BR>  sub t f by t_f ; <BR>  sub f t by f_t ; <BR>  sub T h by T_h ; <BR>  sub T h.sans by T_h ; <BR>  sub Tcommaaccent h by Tcommaaccent_h ; <BR>  sub Tcommaaccent h.sans by Tcommaaccent_h ; <BR>  sub Tcaron h by Tcaron_h ; <BR>  sub Tcaron h.sans by Tcaron_h ; <BR>  sub t t by t_t ; <BR>} liga; <BR> <BR>Please note that ffi and ffl should precede the two-letter ligatures. Otherwise the two letter ones will get processed, and you'd need to make them input into the three-letter ones. Simpler just to order them differently. <BR> <BR>You'll also be noting that initial white space in a line doesn't matter, that anything after a # sign is ignored as just a comment, and that every line after the first MUST end in a semicolon. Failure to include a semicolon is the most common reason for a feature to fail to compile. Referring to a glyph name that doesn't exist (or got changed) is the next most common reason. <BR> <BR>So hit the compile button regularly to check that you haven't messed anything up. It's the little stack of sheets with the down arrow on it. <BR> <BR>The numbers work pretty much the same as the other stuff. The one remaining feature that is complicated is your multiplication substitution. <BR> <BR>This code ought to work, though I haven't tested it. Luckily you don't have more than one glyph of backwards context, so you won't be affected by the clarification/change in the definition of how that's processed: <BR> <BR>feature calt { # contextual alternates <BR>    sub [zero one two three four five six seven eight nine] x' [zero one two three four five six seven eight nine] by multiply <BR>} calt; <BR> <BR>Now, you could clean up that code by defining a class for the digits. Also, you might need to extend it to cover the other number forms (oldstyle and any others you have). <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Tom, for answering the original question&hellip;finally! But your answer seems to begin with the assumption we're working on an existing OT font. Please give us a procedure for taking, say, a TT or Type 1 font  (that's our own&ndash;legal!)and turning it into OT and adding those very first OT features.  I'm not even sure yet how to add the extra glyph slots to accomodate the extra characters being added, or how to properly  identify the new slots in a way that InDesign will recognize  each one as the one I'm calling for (as you can see, I haven't entered this particular arena at all yet). <BR>Thanks, <BR>Leslie</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not assuming that it's already an OT font. I am however assuming that all the glyphs are in one font and are named correctly. <BR> <BR>S'funny, I was just about to say, I wish Leslie's book was out, since it probably covers this! <BR> <BR>There are probably faster ways of doing this, but one way of merging glyphs is: <BR> <BR>1) Open all the relevant fonts. <BR> <BR>2) For the fonts that have supplemental glyphs, rename them in that font. You can rename a currently selected glyph in the glyph window by digging through the menu commands or just hitting Cmd/Ctrl-\ <BR>   Note the handy &quot;next glyph&quot; button in the glyph renaming dialog. This allows you to cycle through renaming a bunch without having to keep on hitting the rename command again. <BR>   Note also that one could script this sort of thing. I think Adam Twardoch at his steroids.fontlab.com site has a handy script that does stuff like sticking a given suffix onto a bunch of glyph names. Could be great for this kind of thing. <BR> <BR>3) After you have all the glyphs renamed, select them all, and hit copy. Switch to the other font, and do a contextual click in the main window, and choose &quot;append.&quot; Whammo, they're all there. <BR> <BR>Now you can do the OT programming. <BR> <BR>As for how to name glyphs, that's a whole 'nother story&hellip;. But one that has been addressed here at length in other threads. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm. One problem with the above workflow is that it doesn't address getting the kerning from the supplemental fonts into the main font. Probably AFTER you rename the glyphs, you would need to export kerning in the form of an AFM or something, and then after appending the glyphs into the master font, import the AFM kerning. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sean &ndash; <BR> <BR>Despite the confusion and/or contradictions in the FF EULA, I would suggest contacting FontFont first and asking permission to make an OT version for the use of your company. It would just be good form. <BR> <BR>You might find that they have already done so for another client or that they are currently working on it and would be able to get you copies easily. Or you may find that they'd be happy to do the work for you at a reasonable rate. On the other hand, they might say Hey, better you than us, Fine, Go for it, and Good luck. <BR> <BR>Despite the fact that Thomas was actually able to make it sound relatively easy in theory (good job Thomas, as always), it will still be a fair amount of work in practice &ndash; especially troubleshooting and making sure that all the fonts work reliably before you stake your entire production cycle on them (!). <BR> <BR>If your publisher is investing all the time and effort in a redesign, it might be worth having the OT fonts developed professionally. Any cost is likely to be negligible within the context of the whole. Redesigning a magazine and totally revamping editorial/design workflows is complicated enough without adding detailed technical font production to the process. I would suggest exploring getting FontFont to do this for you. <BR> <BR>Unless of course, you don't have anything better to do and your employer doesn't mind paying for your learning curve ;-)  (But do ask first.) <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This EULA is, incidentally, a classic example of everything that is wrong with legal drafting in the software industry. Whatever it is supposed to mean, as an attempt at producing a clear statement of rights and responsibilities, it is a disgrace. <BR> <BR>When you buy a font, you are buying the right to use it, in certain defined ways. It ought not to be necessary to go back later and ask &quot;What can I do?&quot; It ought to be as clear as it can be. As it stands, it is not. Instead it looks as if boilerplate language from some other software licence, or probably a number of them has been pressed into service. <BR> <BR>It really ought not to be difficult to provide a simple list: things you may do; things you must not do. These should be clearly set out in a file that accompanies the font files so that it is always accessible. <BR> <BR>If type-designers and digital foundries wish to maintain their rights and earn a fair return on their investment &ndash; which seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable ambition &ndash; they really ought to give more thought to the fact that a transaction whereby they licence the use of their product has two sides.

		<div class="commentbody">Kent <BR> <BR>I'm sure that &quot;when in doubt, ask&quot; is an excellent motto, and that professional courtesy is a good thing too. I also think there are areas where good manners (especially good professional manners) may cause one to do things that the law does not require. <BR> <BR>But contracts are not for nice people. Nice people usually don't need legal intervention. They are for nasty people, for selfish people, and for cases of dispute: for OW Holmes's &quot;bad man&quot; &ndash; the &quot;bad man&quot; who might misuse a typeface, and the &quot;bad foundry&quot; which might behave unreasonably. Contracts matter most precisely where &quot;good manners&quot; are breaking down. From that point of view, they really ought to be clear about what is and is not permissible. In other words, there really ought not to be much doubt, either way. The boundaries of what the selfish user can do and the selfish producer demand ought to be clear. <BR> <BR>The decent user may appreciate that some things, while legal, are not quite acceptable. The decent foundry may understand that some things, while not expressly permitted, are reasonable. Each may accommodate the other. But it is wrong in principal that this should happen because the EULA is unclear, or inaccessible, or self-contradictory, or confused if that can be avoided.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think asking for permission is generally good practice, but it's also dangerous: there are people out there who are unreasonable, unwilling to compromise, and getting a permission rejected would put you in an unfair bind. So one good tactic might be to ask around about the general behavior of the party in question, and only ask permission if you find no reason to believe that they're nasties. It might sound Machiavellian (although he was a softie compared to today's politicians), but there's a reason for a reputation preceding somebody, and society needs reasonable individuals. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting&hellip; isn't the standard glyph naming for those supposed to be f_i, f_l, f_f_i, f_f_l etc? <BR> <BR>Cool to know though! <BR> <BR>Does anyone know how to export kerning metric info for a selected range of characters in FontLab? Obviously I'll need to do that (and import it as well) for the small caps, etc. The manual is horribly dense, and I can't find that info. It seems as though I could delete all the glyphs I am not using, then export the metrics from that file (although I'm not sure if the metrics are tied to the glyph, or the glyph name&hellip; that could be confusing), then import them into my file that contains both the standard glyphs, and the small caps glyphs, it seems like FontLab will match them up. Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Tiffany, I don't know if I agree that it's necessary to contact the foundry when the EULA specifically states that you are allowed to modify your own files. Why waste everyone's time?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&hellip;just the way the fi and fl ligatures work in both InDesign and Quark.</i> <BR> <BR>Well, Quark on the Mac, anyway. QuarkXPress on Windows doesn't do ligatures &ndash; not even fi and fl &ndash; in normal fonts. InDesign on Windows does the basic ligatures even in Type 1 fonts, as long as they are present and named correctly (which they generally are, they're just unencoded). <BR> <BR>Of course, &quot;expert set&quot; fonts work fine in QXP, even on Windows. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&gt;Tiffany, I don't know if I agree that it's necessary to contact the foundry when the EULA specifically states that you are allowed to modify your own files. Why waste everyone's time?</i> <BR> <BR>Sean, this is only my opinion: It is a matter of the degree or nature of the modification. If a EULA allows modification for personal use and you wish to adjust the leg of the R to fit a particular dept head style you're creating throughout a pub&ndash; fine. Or perhaps you want to rearrange the OS figures out of an expert set into the regular font as a matter of convenience &ndash; okay. <BR> <BR>But (again, my opinion), to convert an entire complex font family to a different format and add features is a different degree of modification. Many EULAs (even those that allow for personal mods, I believe) do prohibit recompiling or converting into different formats &ndash; i.e., creating an entirely different software program &ndash; without permission.  <BR> <BR>I'm not saying don't go ahead with your plan. That's your choice. I'm just explaining why I personally might choose to spend the time communicating with the foundry.  <BR> <BR>As a personal example: Recently a project at my publisher required (at the last minute) an instance of italic for a title citation in text that was spec'ed in a face that did not have an italic version. I was asked to quickly create an oblique for them. I contacted Bitstream to get permission first. Jim Lyles informed me that in fact they had already done this for another client, but had not planned on releasing the oblique version for commercial release. He offered to send me the data if I wanted or I could go ahead and make my own if I preferred (for exclusive use by this one client, obviously). The exchange took but a few e-mails and it was not a waste of everyone's time. No deadlines missed; good relations all around. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR> <BR></div>
