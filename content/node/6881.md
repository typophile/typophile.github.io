body: Hi Everyone! <BR>This logo is for Elite Plastic Surgery. I know some of you
  have opinions about glaring typographic errors, etc., and I would love to hear them!
  Thanks for your help.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49918.jpg"

  body: i think this logo is pretty funny. i always have trouble liking logos where
    a picture is incorporated into the letters, because you have to try to see a picture
    and a letter, and you can&#39;t see them at the same time. <BR> <BR>the first
    E has a weird ending, and could be better... i would suggest having the line drawing
    separate from the type.  also, why isn&#39;t the other E attached? <BR> <BR>are
    the words &#34;Plastic Surgery&#34; going to be incorporated?

  body: looks a little op art to me.  like something you&#39;d see in the New Yorker
    a decade ago. <BR> <BR>However, the idea of the letters &#39;drawing&#39; the
    face is a good idea.  I just think here your E is getting wonky, try looking at
    the E without the face, as just a letter. <BR> <BR>perhaps the face is more idiographic/abstract.  the
    face profile could be circular and tie in better with the E.  your letters could
    be a geometric sans serif.  something contemporary and sleek.  I think this would
    be more fitting for a plastic surgery clinic named Elite. <BR> <BR>also, for another
    concept the E could be an eye.

  body: Do they still call it &#39;plastic&#39; surgery? I thought they prefer &#39;cosmetic&#39;
    these days... <BR> <BR>I like the whole concept/style. I agree that perhaps you&#39;re
    forcing the &#39;e&#39; a bit too much.

  body: The face seems as if it is being forced into the shape of the &#34;e&#34;.
    At first glance, I just kept staring at the face wondering what was going on there
    instead of reading &#34;elite&#34;. That might bring up some issues because if
    the name gets lost when people look at this, it will defeat the purpose of conveying
    the brand. <BR> <BR>The face looks like a football player from the 1920s, where
    a facemask wasn&#39;t a part of the helmet. Also, I thought of Amelia Eahart with
    the old pilot style cap which is confusing. <BR> <BR>I see what you&#39;re trying
    to do here by making the swash of the &#34;l&#34; cross the eye of the graphic.
    But it almost looks painful, almost poking into the eye which is probably not
    what the surgeon wants to convey.  <BR> <BR>Also, the face seems as if it is worried
    or concerned, as opposed to being happy and excited about surgery which might
    convey the wrong message.  <BR> <BR>Try to do some more research into the plastic
    surgery market in general, and ask the client some more specific questions to
    come up with more solutions.

  body: Unless the Plastic Surgery is about correcting an accident or birth defect,
    then its about self esteem. The illustration could use refinement but its a great
    start. What era was more self assorbed then pre-depression America. The Illustration
    alludes to what you might want to achieve, captured youth, beauty? I&#39;m not
    ready to say this isn&#39;t a way to go. Why look like every other Plastic Surgent.
    Dam the research

  body: 'I would suggest ditching graphic representations <BR>and focus solely on
    a wordmark for Elite. <BR>Does the client want upscale and classy?  <BR>A custom
    script or a delicate serif might <BR>do the job. <BR> <BR>Scriptwise, there are
    wonderful opportunities with the: <BR>&#42; Capital E <BR>&#42; the i-t combo
    &#40;dot on the &#39;i&#39;, crossbar on the &#39;t&#39; <BR>&#41; <BR>&#42; and
    the lowercase finishing &#39;e&#39; <BR> <BR>You might find success sketching
    softly  <BR>with a light pencil and trying as many <BR>variations as you can.
    <BR> <BR>just suggestions.  <BR> <BR>Also, the &#39;lite&#39; that you have <BR>could
    be revised into something pretty nice. <BR> <BR>bj'

  body: Thanks again, everyone! <BR>The client specified that he wanted a female profile
    and I wanted to stray from any predictability. This was the only thing he was
    specific about.  Now, against any of Daniel&#39;s endearing support for Deco surgery,
    I must say that I&#39;ll re-open this logo when we get a fashion cosmetic client.
    Well, it was fun to work on while the moment lasted. Your comments are much appreciated!

  body: if the clients needs to have the profile, try looking at some profiles of
    women. try to determine which one represents the perfect profile.  This profile
    looks awkward and doesnt tell me that this is a credible plastic surgen.  otherwise
    its a beautiful mark but not sure if it fits. <BR> <BR>I would try talking the
    client into making a logotype, like bj said.

    illustration work from the 1950s.

  body: If he wants a profile, what about a much more abstract representation? By
    drawing the entire head I think it comes off as a bit almost cartoony, if you
    were to just use something like a single line for the face in a side profile I
    think you could lend a much more upscale look to it.
