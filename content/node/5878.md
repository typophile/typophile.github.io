  body: Food is one of the few areas of my life that I insist on keeping at a distance
    from type. I&#39;ve even trained myself to ignore the typography of menus.

  body: Ignoring menu typography is a discipline in itself. I used fake mustard &#40;pva
    glue, spray painted&#41; for a leaving card a few years ago. A simple script is
    all I could manage certainly not a sans. <BR>Tim

    on the type to run it through the dishwasher after a meal. <BR>B
