body: I picked up a copy of Esquire Magazine &#40;which I don&#39;t normally read&#41;
  this month and am smitten with the san they use throughout. Can anyone tell me what
  it is &#40;or if it&#39;s even available&#41;? Here&#39;s the cover -- it&#39;s
  all over it &#40;the one used in &#34;The Naked Truth About Women&#34;, for example&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/32703.jpg"

    this one away! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Fabio was asking me about this font the other day... we got nowhere. He was
    smitten by the font and the woman, too.

  body: I&#39;m sorry, did someone say there was type on this cover? Where is it?
    All I see is Rachel Weisz and a snake.

  body: Crank 8. I bought a book about Henk Elenga a year ago which was it&#39;s first
    use. I believe is is about $100 from instersection studios. At the time there
    was of course no mention of typeface <BR>designer nor source. When Greg Lindy
    first surfaced &#40;in my serach&#41; it was with his font releases with Thirstype.
    I bought Section which is also quite nice.  <BR> <BR>Sample from book  <BR> <BR><img
