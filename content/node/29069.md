  Hugo. \r\nAmazing stuff! I have seen a few typefaces with the multiple lines from
  the 60's & 70's \r\nbut I am after some names, and ones that have been digitized.
  Or even more modern \r\none that have been made similar. Any help would be greatly
  appreciated. Thanks! \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/loveworn_3916.gif]"

    Design-Lines</a> is just one of many variations. ITC AKI Lines is another, popular
    as a phototype film font but I haven't seen digitized."

    (and have old catalog samples) PLINC (Photo-Lettering Inc.) and Solotype offering
    customized \"prisma/prismatic\" versions of faces. Apparently much was done with
    lenses, soft-lenses and oil... in other words, smoke & mirrors."

    version of the typeface Aki Lines would, I think, find no other font - the ICG
    Letterpress CDs having not been offered for years.\r\n\r\nI didn't do a Web search
    for it earlier, but try <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=akka&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=TIFFONT&nb_ppp=10&classt=alpha\"
