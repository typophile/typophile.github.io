  body: Which program are you using?? You could always use the old-fashioned way.
    Superscript the &#39;1&#39; and subscript the &#39;2&#39;.

  body: Best guess, 50% ... however, I would say the i&#123;most} important thing
    is that it visually fits in the space.

  body: Don&#39;t forget, also, that most fonts have a fraction bar  <BR>&#40;shift-option-1&#41;.
    It sits on the baseline and at a <BR>greater angle than the slash.

  body: 'Aw, you beat me to it, Mr. Coles.  <BR>  <BR>Here&#39;s the quickie tutorial:  <BR>  <BR>1.
    Type the fraction. ie. 1/2 - Be sure to use the fraction bar, Shift-Option-1.  <BR>  <BR>2.
    Select the numerator and either a&#41; make it superscript or b&#41; change the
    font size to 50% size and shift the baseline. If working with a 12pt font, you
    can change the numerator to 6pt and then give it a 6pt baseline shift. &#40;These
    functions are easily found in the Text tool palette&#41;  <BR>  <BR>3. Select
    the denominator and change its font size to 50% size  <BR>  <BR>4. Finally, check
    your kerning - you might need to nudge the characters to get it just right.  <BR> '
