  are used in somewhat older printed matter, I've attached a .pdf. Does anybody know
  where these fonts have their origins? I do know that in old versions of AutoCad
  there were strokefonts, but maybe anybody knows if there is a program that used
  this specific font?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nThijs."
