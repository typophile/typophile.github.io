<p>I have found Linux Libertine and been running it through some laser prints. I&rsquo;m thinking in terms of a font for long academic texts (humanities). I would also pay for a font, but there is something modern yet Caslonesque about this font that I like. At the same time, there is a lightness that I&rsquo;m worried won&rsquo;t hold up.</p>
<p>Just curious, what is your reaction to the font?</p>

Now &ldquo;boring&rdquo; can be taken as an emotional response; all I can add is that there is a difference between &ldquo;boring&rdquo; and &ldquo;unobtrusive.&rdquo; Unobtrusive is good for long academics texts, boring is not.</p>
<p>As to the weight (lightness) &ndash; it is hard to tell on the screen, at the size shown. Here is a trick: Gentium is also a free font, and because of the extended character set, quite useful for texts where only the word processor is used (laser printout). In my experience, Gentium prints well enough on a laser printer, but is too thin to print well on an offset press, where the plates are made from the computer files (direct to plate offset printing). If that is your intended use, download Gentium &amp; compare it. If they have generally the same weight, it is too light for offset.</p>

<p>Could you elaborate more on the mistakes that you see?  Also, have you looked at the PDF sample on LinLibertine&rsquo;s webpage?
<a href="http://linuxlibertine.sourceforge.net/"><a href="http://linuxlibertine.sourceforge.net/">http://linuxlibertine.sourceforge.net/</a></a>
That will give you a better sense than the gif posted above.  I&rsquo;m not sure how tuned LinLibertine&rsquo;s hinting is.</p>

At your request, I did go to the website, but the downloaded PDF shows only boxes, not characters here at home, on my wife&rsquo;s Mac. I&rsquo;ll have to wait until I get into the office to see what&rsquo;s what.</p>
<p>But based on the small sample above, the bowl of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t fit other letters, the top &amp; terminal of the &ldquo;f&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t know where it is going, the descender of the &ldquo;y&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t balance quite right, and the serif on the upper arm of the &ldquo;z&rdquo; (which probably reminded the original poster of Caslon) seems out of place. I get the impression, again from the small sample, that the font doesn&rsquo;t quite know whether it is suppose to be slightly condensed or slightly expanded.</p>
<p>I fully grant that the sample is small, &amp; if I saw the full character set it might seem to have better balance. My guess is no, but I guess wrong every day.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, thank you for the input so far. I had originally hoped that Linux Libertine would be viable because the creator has obviously put a lot of work into it with the small caps and full complement of diacritics. Out of fairness I include another image generated by adobe rather than ms of the font.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/linlib2_4181.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Coincidentally I have recently discovered minion lurking in my acrobat folder. To me its feeling of genericness is too intentional. I am currently debating between a baskerville and the new century schoolbook with sanskrit diacritics on 
<a href="http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/index.html">http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/index.html</a>
Which baskerville? I like Lange&rsquo;s and Storm&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m rambling, I notice that there&rsquo;s a cd with four Bitstream Aldine 401 fonts (and a bunch of other stuff) for $29 at myfonts.com, cheap indeed, and seems like it might be have better contrast than Bembo but not as nice as Bembo book.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last 25 years setting long academic texts (usually in the humanities), and have a couple of observations that may apply.</p>
<p>The first is, if you are setting material that will be printed offset, you need to see how the font prints that way, not on a laser printer. Generally, the font will appear rather lighter when printed offset.</p>
<p>The second is to avoid any fonts with a EULA that prohibits modifying them for your own use, as do all the NEW Monotype &amp; Linotype OT fonts.  The reason is you will inevitably come across a diacritic or character not in the font. Now from 1980 to 1995 (when we started using PostScript fonts), we also couldn&rsquo;t get inside the font to make up special sorts (glyphs). For diacriticals, you can work around this, but it helps greatly to use what is now called a &ldquo;layout engine&rdquo; that lets you program things, like TeX. Imagine setting 400 &ldquo;emacrons&rdquo; with a font that didn&rsquo;t have this character, where you couldn&rsquo;t program it.</p>
<p>Then there are special characters, which you sometimes just can&rsquo;t properly render from existing characters. The &ldquo;eng&rdquo; comes to mind. So you either borrow one from another font, or pay the foundry to make one up. The foundry&rsquo;s special sorts will be both expensive &amp; slow to come.</p>
<p>I, for one, rejoiced at PostScript Type 1 fonts. Yes, they printed too thin, esp. with direct-to-plate offset lithography, but you could fix them. That was the beauty of them, with a weeks worth of work, you could make something that printed well, and you could add characters as you needed them. Nothing much has changed with OT, except those licenses (EULAs) which with one stroke take away the advantage of truly &ldquo;Open&rdquo; type.</p>
<p>There are enough foundries out there who permit modifying a font for your own use, that permit embedding, etc. that you should pick one of those. After 25 years, I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; font, I like 10-12 for text, but part of that appreciation is how they work for the text, and part of &ldquo;working for the text&rdquo; is the ability to make up special sorts.</p>
<p>FWIW</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, Miss Tiffany, I at least sort of do. But I&rsquo;ll confess it helps a lot when the foundry offers something other than legalese &ndash; Like Adobe&rsquo;s FAQ&rsquo;s on licenses.</p>
<p>There was a Harvard (Yale?) law professor who was, shall we say, down on Credit Cards. In one of her senior law classes, a student came in &amp; showed her an offering where you got money back. As an exercise, she had the class try to determine under just what conditions they&rsquo;d get money back. At the end, after hours of work, they could not reach common agreement.</p>
<p>Now, not all Harvard (Yale?) law students are dumb. And these were seniors, about to head out into the world. So what chance do you think  you or I would have?</p>
<p>In a way, I prefer the EULA&rsquo;s which say, right in the font on the copyright page in FontLab &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do a damn thing with this font.&rdquo; At least I&rsquo;m sure about what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things about Adobe&rsquo;s license is it seems to forbid modifying the font, but when you read the FAQ, it&rsquo;s clear that modifying under certain conditions is permitted. The interesting thing is, according to Thomas Phinney, that the same lawyers wrote both the EULA and the FAQ. Go figure; what kind of a contract is that?</p>
<p>. . . or is this a case of the choir preaching to the minister?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Charles_e, thanks for your comments. I find that there is an underlying issue here which I have not expressed.</p>
<p>In a production environment where there are several layers of service, everything has to be kosher, no modification means no modification (one could be sued, or worse, moralized at). Eulas allowing for modification make for much more efficient workflow, bringing us closer to typographical nirvāṇa. Also with digital texts increasingly being associated with the printed text, it is important to have proper unicode encoding rather than manually combining diacritical marks with letters in TeX/InDesign.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it is the free fonts which are working hardest to provide full diacritical complements: Gentium, Linux Libertine, Junicode, Cardo, DejaVu Sans, and others. These fonts are appearing because there is genuine frustration among scholars, which includes graduate students, who need to use diacritical characters not found in the standard fonts. For example, I know of a Buddhist Studies mailing list for scholars only, with several hundred members, and I guarantee that each one of them has some sort of non-commercial solution for writing the &ldquo;n-dot-under&rdquo; (in the word nirvana, above) and the other Sanskrit and Pali diacritics. This is because there are no commercial fonts available that include a full complement of diacritics. (Gentium would be a good reference point for what to include.) Scholars are not software pirates; they are generally willing to purchase things that meet their research needs. Scholars are also vain, and so there is a certain pride when the laser-printed manuscript or conference paper is printed in a nice font with all of the proper diacritics. Publishers with are increasingly asking for manuscripts in unicode. There is a definite market for reasonably priced fonts with extended diacritics.</p>
<p>Many software companies have academic licenses. Why not for fonts? The stipulation for educational and not commercial use would justify the necessarily low price while preventing its use by publishers and presses. A commercially licensed version could include small caps, figures, superior numbers (for footnotes, of course), etc. and be sold for a normal price.</p>
<p>A single good quality serif font, with the diacritics of gentium, in the standard 4 faces would be enough. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the latest Sabon, but it should be a serious text font. A matched sans would be a nice option too. A tt/ot font is preferable because ms word 97, 2000, and xp have problems accessing extended character ranges in ps/ot fonts.</p>

Stating that someone isn&rsquo;t aware of why they&rsquo;re doing something is hurtful.
What gives you the right to comment on people&rsquo;s motivations and (in your opinion) lack of self-awareness?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally considered rude, and the guidelines at Typophile are:
&ldquo;please conduct yourself with restraint and treat others who use these discussion boards with respect&hellip; please refrain from any personal attacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You have been repeatedly asked to refrain from ad hominem arguments and yet you are unable to restrain yourself.</p>
<p>If you disagree with what Tiffany is saying, deal with what she says, but don&rsquo;t put her down for being (in your opinion) unaware of what she&rsquo;s doing.</p>

To you I&rsquo;m offensive, to me you&rsquo;re offensive. Now what?</p>
<p>And do not try to rally support for you nefarious cause by comparing your case with Tiffany&rsquo;s. She has many redeeming qualities, critically here including the ability to see her own faults, and the (related) ability to absorb criticism. She is not a hyper-sensitive primadonna who has hissy-fits and replaces her posts with periods as soon as I say something that violates her personal social rules. She knows that whatever those rules happen to be they cannot extend very far in a place such as this. She knows what compromise and tolerance really mean. And she has never called anybody a &ldquo;clueless idiot&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The thing is, your historic issue with me is not about expressive style, it is in fact about content, and this &ldquo;show restraint with personal attacks&rdquo; business is pure Western formalistic scapegoating, which of course fits in predictably with your background. If you want to promulgate bad typography with impunity, do it somewhere I&rsquo;m not. What I suggest instead is for you to promulgate whatever the hell junk you want wherever you want, but don&rsquo;t try to stifle the fallout. Your persistent whining indicates an inability to come to terms with all this, and it tells me that I am not in fact more lacking in restraint than you.</p>

<p>The difference is that I don&rsquo;t psychoanalyze people I disagree with, or diss their background. You don&rsquo;t have a clue what goes on inside other people&rsquo;s heads, yet in your previous post you have presumptuously treated us all to an in-depth look at Tiffany&rsquo;s thoughts and emotions, and mine.
That&rsquo;s plain rudeness in the culture Typophile is part of.
&ldquo;Show restraint from personal attacks&rdquo; is a Typophile guideline which you have decided doesn&rsquo;t apply to you, as you say &ldquo;whatever those rules happen to be they cannot extend very far in a place such as this.&rdquo; 
Sure, I once called you a clueless idiot, but I have frequently been at my wit&rsquo;s end to know how to deal with your offensive comments. Most people just avoid tangling with you, because if they deny their faults, as pointed out by you, they know they will get even more of the same. Talk type, dude, stay out of people&rsquo;s heads.</p>

That&rsquo;s what you can&rsquo;t handle. If I were to psychonalyse you and conclude that you&rsquo;re fit to make the best fonts in history, you&rsquo;d LOVE me!</p>

<p>There are more differences, some of which are in my favor
and against you. You don&rsquo;t get it. You only see your side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have frequently been at my wit’s end</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Show some restraint.
At the very least don&rsquo;t hijack threads out of the blue simply to pursure your own personal agenda - it&rsquo;s disrespectful of Typophile, which is more than a tool for you to use any which way you like - it&rsquo;s a society. It is greater than you. But sadly you&rsquo;re too individualistic to ever grasp anything like that.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another crazy idea: when you lose your wits, apologize afterwards. The fact that you pretty much never do reflects quite poorly on you. To me it means you&rsquo;re unfit to communicate effectively. Which is not to say I think you shouldn&rsquo;t try. Just stop whining already, PLEASE! It&rsquo;s so offensive. And you already have this on your side: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/16005">http://typophile.com/node/16005</a></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Convenient fabrication - the proof being that you&rsquo;re the only person to ever have taken up my &ldquo;fruitful avoidance&rdquo; offer above. Other people either don&rsquo;t have enough of a problem with me, or they have a problem but they don&rsquo;t want to lose the potential benefits of my contributions and/or they feel that it would be a dishonorable, weak-kneed cop-out. But really, most people simply don&rsquo;t say things I disagree with at almost every turn! You have to understand, your &ldquo;design philosophy&rdquo; is so whacked in my book that anything that comes out of it is likely to be offensive to me. And I owe you no favors, so I feel no need to allow you to confuse people for your own ends.</p>

<p>The scenario is this: a client I&rsquo;ve worked with before wants some modifications to a font, not mine. So, do they contact the foundry to do the changes? Possibly, but there are three issues: delivery, price and quality. The original designer may not be available right now, the price may be too much, and the quality is in some respects unknown, as they haven&rsquo;t worked with that designer before &ndash; quality being a result of process. Of course, none of that may be problematic, but the tendency is to contact someone you have a working relationship with.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>wizz &ndash; just to get a bit back on topic, (for Typical), The situation with free fonts and academics can still be confusing. I&rsquo;m at home &amp; away from everything but a computer hooked to the net &amp; almost no other software. But as I remember, Gentium&rsquo;s EULA forbids modification. Less sure about Junicode.</p>
<p>And the problem, at least in the states, is deeper than finding one good font. Academicians, if they teach in the States, want tenure. To get tenure, you usually need a couple journal publications and a book. Now a journal, if it is printed, will have a set of fonts which are always used. And a book will be designed by either an in-house or freelance designer at a university press. Will they have time (a cynic would say have the interest) to see if the font they choose for the text has the needed diacriticals or special characters? Perhaps, but don&rsquo;t place a heavy bet. The number of fonts suitable for a book interior containing the characters needed for transliterated Arabic or IAST is real small. I can&rsquo;t think of any offhand. Some of the work we get is due to this very situation.</p>
<p>My point is, how a manuscript appears is is valuable only for the manuscript, not for typesetting. But you are quite right &ndash; for the author&rsquo;s files to be useful, Unicode should be used.</p>
<p>I wonder if Adobe would be interested in making up, say Minion, with the needed glyphs. Now Minion may be viewed by the designers-whose-primary-aim-is-to-impress-other-designers as &ldquo;boring,&rdquo; but it is more than serviceable for book interiors. I have over 1,000 fonts at work, but when I design, I specify Minion reasonably often, because it fits the author&rsquo;s work and my understanding of the intended audience.</p>
<p>Things may be different along the Pacific Rim, but in much of the world, there is usually a difference between a <cite>manuscript</cite> and a finished product &ndash; not that this is necessarily a good thing.</p>
<p>FWIW</p>

<p>As an occasional designer &ndash; and somebody who knows many graphic designers &ndash; I&rsquo;d say that doesn&rsquo;t fit. The customer/art director/senior editor etc. will make some changes. I don&rsquo;t know how to say it in German, but the English word &ldquo;Art&rdquo; has several uses. It is sort of like art for it&rsquo;s own sake is art, and can be accepted or rejected (bought or not). On the other hand, something that has an aesthetic element, but where the intended purpose is something other than art, doesn&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t change it&rdquo; aspect of fine art.</p>
<p>It is that &ldquo;other purpose&rdquo; at issue here. So, if you don&rsquo;t like a typeface, don&rsquo;t buy it &ndash; unless a customer insists on its use,  in which case you can decline the commission, or accept it &amp; hold your nose. But if a typeface is generally what is wanted by all, but in some small detail fails to perform its intended purpose (it is incomplete, had one really bad character, etc.), I would view that as different.</p>
<p>Gentium, proposed above as a solution for certain kinds of academic texts, has no ligatures, no old-style numbers, no small caps, and no kerning. That it lack a bold doesn&rsquo;t bother me, but would bother some. Now these aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;small details,&rdquo; they move the font from once category to another. Additionally, the overall aesthetic of Gentium is less than ideal for some texts, good for others, as with any single typeface. So, Gentium solves one kind of problem for academic authors, generating a manuscript which anyone can follow. That was its purpose. It does not solve another problem, namely publishing. Having the freedom to &ldquo;modify&rdquo; other fonts solves this problem.</p>
<p>This is just one example,there are many, since it would be absurd to insist the font designer anticipates all the uses of his/her product. It doesn&rsquo;t even make sense to say the painter &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t foresee the uses of their painting&rdquo; &ndash; unless you get political, where nothing make sense.</p>

I am still looking for a font that will fulfill my research needs with Sanskrit diacritical letters and satisfy me aesthetically. (It looks like I will purchase one and then add the diacritics.)</p>

<p>I once got into a heated long drawn out email debate with CSA after purchasing a CD of their stock art. After opening 8 layers of superb packaging, we pop the CD in only to realize the stock art is nothing but scanned in BMP files, which we found useless, so asked for our money back if we returned it. I then got to see the absurd wrath of Chuck explaining that as a powerful graphic design firm, us opening the packaging forever bound us to their EULA which prohibits returns.</p>
<p>In otherwords, by purchasing said product, we waived all rights to customer service in their mind&hellip;and how DARE we question it.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure Chuck isn&rsquo;t as insane as he was in those emails, but for some reason, folks go into insane mode when it comes to issues of their own IP and EULAs. And consumers soon just ignore them all together just as we ignore things like &lsquo;NO TURN ON RED&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s 2am and you are the only vehicle in a 2 mile radius on the road.</p>

<p>I was keen to get some further opinions on &lsquo;classic-round&rsquo;. I like it, and I&rsquo;m considering using it black (on white stock) offset. It&rsquo;s a contender, although as it&rsquo;s only available in 1 weight I fear I might regret it in future. It could be really limiting in future applications.</p>
<p>Am I missing any other obvious issues? Or is it widely considered a &lsquo;good&rsquo; font?</p>

<p>I decided I wanted something a little more &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; in the end and I&rsquo;m going to use [[http://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?SMrsXLR.html | Mrs Eaves XL]] for print paired with Georgia online.</p>
