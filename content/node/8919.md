  body: similarity as in the font style and how it has a sort of background that looks
    kind of like taped letters &#40;if you look hard enough, its like each letter
    has its own blocked background and that&#39;s what i was looking for&#41;

    14 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> &#40;Strange, Distressed Scripts&#41; and see
    if you find anything. There is no exact match for this, but there are a few that
    might be what you are looking for. There are about 450 fonts I have collected
    in this category.
