  body: James, you&#39;re description is dead-on. The name of the font is DecoTech,
    a freeware font I created several years ago. Feeling it was too derivative of
    ITC Anna &#40;not to mention poorly done&#41;, I&#39;ve since removed it from
    sites under my control, though it&#39;s still available from other sources &#40;it&#39;s
    impossible to kill these things once you&#39;ve set them loose&#41;.
