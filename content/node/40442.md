  isolation of their home while renovating and thought they'd keep it for me. I posted
  the pictures below to my flickr account and hope the links will work.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/memostothefuture/2147312308/\">anyone recognize
  the headline font?</a> \r\nI find the \"\xDF\" and \"f\" in here quite beatiful.
  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/memostothefuture/2147312276/\"> here is a
  closeup</a>.\r\n\r\nand just for fun - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/memostothefuture/2147312316/\">check
  out this W</a>. is that an infinity symbol in there?\r\n\r\n\r\n(couple more shots
  in my flickr stream, if you like)"

  body: "The \xDF looks like Bodoni Antiqua from Berthold (see attached sample from
    the Guide). However the 'f' doesn't match. Most Bodonis have a flat-topped 't',
    but your newspaper doesn't -- also like Bodoni Antiqua. It's hard to see if the
    same type was used for the text, as well as the headlines, but you might be able
    to use the Serif Font ID Guide if you have a good look at the letters. \r\n\r\n-

    attach. This is my first time logged on with my <em>new Mac</em>, and I still
    am learning how things work. Any suggestions for what my problem might be? I clicked
    on 'Insert image' and selected my image, but it wasn't uploaded.\r\n\r\n- Mike
