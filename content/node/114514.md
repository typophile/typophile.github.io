  name for some OT fonts and TTX 2.4 seems the ideal candidate for this job.\r\n\r\nI've
  just downloaded the sources file of TTX 2.4 from sourceforge, but installing from
  source is not so easy...\r\n\r\nLuckily, according to the install.txt file in the
  Doc folder, \"for Windows and MacOS there are easy-to-use TTX installers\". So where
  can I download these installers?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nManosk"
