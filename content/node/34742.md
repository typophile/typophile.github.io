body: "Ricardo has been a Typophile user since 2005. He's in the \"Prolific Poster\"
  as one of the top contributors in the past 10 days... yet his icon is the generic,
  blank T. Design Ricardo an icon and post it in this thread for him.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you say Ricardo? If someone posts a good one would you use it?\r\n\r\nSame goes
  for Robert Koritnik, aka <em>litera</em>. He's listed as a top contributor, but
  he's only been a member for almost 4 weeks.\r\n\r\nBest designs win bragging rights

  body: "<strong>ROTFLMAO!</strong>\r\n\r\nToo F'ing Funny You Guys!!! Thanks for
    giving me a lot of laughs this morning...  :-D\r\n\r\nJoe, while we're on the
    subject of how long I've been here on Typophile and have your attention, I've
    actually been here for 3 years and 50 weeks, according to <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/2022\">my
    earlier profile: ric</a>... Is there any way to reunite the two under my current
    user name? I know a lot of other Typophilers had this problem... Thanks in advance.
    \ :-)\r\n\r\nFontplayer and Pearlstreet get my top votes. So does Nick Shinn for
    sheer humour (that's right, I spelled it the British way). And Eben's second one,
    with the blue background and input from Patty and Hrant -- I like that one, too.
    Typographic Collaboration indeed!  :-)\r\n\r\nFontplayer, I think I still have
    a heavily doodled high school notebook cover onto which I had stuck the RC Cola
    initials...\r\n\r\nLast but not least is Litera... I have thought of using those
    very two symbols as well, although not exactly like that -- now I should make
    you one! (I've also thought of using the <strong>R</strong> and <strong>C</strong>
    from the New York City subway system)... I am going to try and post some recent
    sketches for my avatar later in the day, folks... Just so you know that I <em>have</em>
    been working on an avatar!  ;-D\r\n\r\n<em>But hey, don\u2019t kill yourself.</em>\r\n\r\nHrant
    is right, Eben -- I should be the one working on my icon! :-)\r\n\r\nThanks again
    everybody!\r\n\r\n"
