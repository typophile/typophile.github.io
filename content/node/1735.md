  body: I hope you don&#39;t mean their fonts. They were one of  <BR>the first third-party
    PostScript font vendors. Their early  <BR>success at selling fonts had more to
    do with the lack of  <BR>choice than quality. They were pretty bad. Although they  <BR>continued
    to sell them to the end, they stopped developing  <BR>them long ago and went on
    to develop and market some  <BR>very useful software--including what eventually
    became  <BR>iTunes.

  body: Mark, I checked out their bundled package and they do have <BR>quite a few
    specialty fonts that could prove useful for  <BR>specific applications. I&#39;ll
    try to post a few that might be <BR>unique digitizations. <BR> <BR>Granted, viewed
    in its entirety, their type library is poor. <BR>And Conflict Catcher and several
    other apps <BR>never made the jump to OSX...

  body: Gazelle was one of those C&amp;G unique fonts. I had an SSI <BR>knockoff that
    I adored and Mike Y. ID&#39;d the  original as <BR>Gazelle. Sort of an Arthur
    Bakerishly calligraphic script. <BR> <BR>I bought it just in the nick of time,
    as it turned out. Some <BR>of the letter spacing could be better, but the character
    <BR>set is fairly complete. <BR> <BR>It seems like when I surveyed the font offerings
    on the <BR>website, a few of the scripts were the only faces that <BR>stood out
    as unique. <BR> <BR>&#40;What was with that Fluent Laser Fonts moniker?&#41; <BR><br>

  body: Oops. My mistake. I was looking at faces such as <BR>Sedona Script and Aurora
    Grotesk thinking they were <BR>bundled C &amp; G fonts when in fact they are bundled
    <BR>OPTI fonts. <BR> <BR>C &amp; G has a very small library it now appears, with
    Jott, <BR>Dry Gulch and various other crud. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
