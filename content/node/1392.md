body: Hi, <BR>there&#39;s this big german medical company called Boehringer Ingelheim.
  They even have their own corporate font. The problem is, I have no idea, what kind
  of font this EXACTLY is... I need it for use on a PC, hopefully in EastEuropean
  &#40;EE&#41; or CentralEuropean &#40;CE&#41; version...  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16816.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>Any idea, what this thing could be? Looks familiar, doesn&#39;t
  it... <BR> <BR>Gentlemen, start your engines. <BR> <BR>Peter

    there&#39;s quite a bit of Times in there. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking into it.

  body: Yes, the dimensions remind me of Times, yet this one is much-much better done
    &#40;meaning more &#34;modern&#34;&#41;. I thought of some FontShop release, but
    it looks not like that... No idea so far. Here is the logotype of the company
    - it uses a more condensed version of their corporate font. Maybe that could help
    a bit out... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16838.gif"

  body: This font looks like Berthold &#34;Concorde&#34; that has had the Q modified.
    The W is missing from the sample, but all the other letters and numbers, I think,
    look identical to Concorde. See the sample <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AB80084001P1"
    target="_blank"> at Phils Fonts</a> and see if you don&#39;t agree that is the
    base font here. Really it seems that little was changed.

    <BR> <BR>Of course &#40;stupid me&#41;: Concorde was specifically  <BR>designed
