body: This typeface is based on woodcuts. It will have &#34;snap-on serifs&#34; to
  make it have imperfections as keystrokes. Any input is appreciated!

  body: What&#39;s with all this snap-on action all of a sudden? Is there like a Walker
    School of Type Design that just opened up or something?  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway.
    Although this design isn&#39;t my cup of tea, I do very much like the idea of
    having add-ons &#40;not really serifs&#41; to change the aspect of a font - a
    lot of potential there. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
