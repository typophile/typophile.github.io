  the most hackneyed thing ever):\r\n\r\nThe first one on top is tracked at -50 in
  Ai using optical spacing. The \"t\" and \"y\" overlap. \r\n\r\nThe second one separates
  the \"t\" and the \"y\" but then the spacing is less even throughout.\r\n\r\nWhich
  one is correct and why? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6279.jpg]"

  body: Oof for the first one my eyes went straight to that awkward triangle between
    the t and the y where they don't entirely overlap. I'd say the bottom looks more
    "correct" but you should clean up the kerning around the "ate" area.

  body: "Thanks for the comment. \r\n\r\nWould you say that for this sort of logotype,
    as a general rule, the letters should nearly touch (without touching as in the
    \"a\" and \"t\" below) even though the letters are not evenly optically spaced?\r\n "

    make this a distinctive brand mark.  Just a little touch would be enough.  '

  body: From a few of my internships, I've always been told that letters should be
    as readable as possible, especially when it comes to a company's name (which is
    practically its essence). Touching letters on different mediums, such as packaging,
    can be hard to read, which is something to keep in mind.

    in this logo, even if a 'ty' ligature was taken on.\r\n\r\nI think Luma's thoughts
    are spot on."
