    \"They seem\" means, that I am not sure, if I can trust the info from the blog.
    So, if the info from the blog is untrue, please explain in detaily why. Then I
    send a message to the blogger. It is one of the private German top ten blogs."

    been using an illegal logo. I don't have much time now, but the article says the
    typeface used is [[http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/Bienvenue|Bienvenue]],
    designed by Jean-Fran\xE7ois Porchez for exclusive use by France T\xE9l\xE9com."
