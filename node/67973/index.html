  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear typophiles,</p>
<p>I am doing background research for the TypeCon Education Forum this summer where we will discuss what might comprise a post-graduate degree program in typography here in the U.S. 
Please look over the list below and respond by identifying any areas which you have been educated in, have had training in, or have investigated on your own in order to further your typographic work.</p>
<p>This survey is meant for anyone who considers that typography is central to their main line of work. You do not have to be a type designer. Also, feel free to add any areas you think have been overlooked. My objective is to learn what kind of backgrounds those who are currently working in the field have.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to respond. This information will have a direct effect on the panel discussion planned for TypeCon in Los Angeles, and the more responses, the more meaningful the data.</p>

<p>Much of it was both. I did all the research related studying in grad school at Ohio State and we had a very firm education at Carnegie Mellon University where we studied calligraphy and typesetting. We had great guest lecturers like Herman Zapf and Wolfgang Weingart; Semiotics from Gui Bonnsieppe and Martin Krampen; Typography from Jack Staufagher and Ken Hiebert.</p>
<p>Digital Font Production, Latin Script Font Design, Hinting and Programming was all self taught. I did take a weekend class from Maxim Zukov on Cyrillic though (which was fabulous!). I am self-taught in Greek, however but I spoke Greek as a child so it is not so foreign to me.</p>

<p>Since you&rsquo;re researching a post-graduate course, I&rsquo;m guessing it would be useful to know that my degree is a BFA in graphic design.</p>
<p>Latin font design - I took a class that introduced me to this
 
History of aesthetics of type design - Not certain about this one, I had a class in the history of type and I had a type design class. Don&rsquo;t know if that counts. </p>
<p>Digital font production (e.g. fontlab) - Had a semester long class in this, but only many years after graduation did I realize that I was woefully unprepared. Learned more from the manual and trial &amp; error, than from the class.</p>
<p>Font hinting/programming - I&rsquo;ve been taught what I know of this from knowledgeable friends.</p>
<p>Calligraphy - This was covered for half of the semester of type design , I am horrific at it.</p>
<p>Typesetting (stylistic principles) - My internship required typesetting .</p>
<p>Hand printing (letterpress, printmaking) - I was taught letterpress over two weekends so I could teach a high school level community outreach program. I learned as much as the students did from that program.</p>
<p>Graphic Design - My school covered this in great detail, but more was learned from the first 4 years of actual work. School got me in the right mind and taught me how to think, but I didn&rsquo;t learn until I was on my own.</p>
<p> Information Design - I had a semester long course in this , which isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>Web Design - I had a semester long course in this, and then a couple jobs in this field.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The details of my life are quite inconsequential.</p>
<p>Therapist : Oh no, please, please, let&rsquo;s hear about your childhood.</p>
<p>Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we&rsquo;d make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it&rsquo;s breathtaking, I suggest you try it.</p>
<p>Therapist: You know, we have to stop.</p>

I do random freelance work that includes a fair amount of typesetting and occasional creation of odd glyphs of type (generally a few sorts of one or another ancient script needed for a particular job), but I am probably more an editor/writer than a typesetter. I have never studied art or design.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a calligrapher from an early age, but my academic background is as a historian.  In college I wasn&rsquo;t even aware that there was such a thing as a college course in typography.  So I went to college and then graduate school in medieval history and English/linguistics.  Along the way I took courses in typesetting (compugraphic) outside of college and interned at Applewood Press where I learned to set wood and metal type and do basic book design.  In graduate school I also took courses in Paleography and Codicology and my fist typeface designs came from work I did in my Paleography classes.  I&rsquo;ve also worked as an editor and art director, which gave me more experience working with type.  Through the 80s I found myself doing a lot of hand lettering for book and magazine titles, and that naturally transitioned into designing type once the digital tools became available.  The rest is history&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick,
I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself, and in danger of tripping up, just yet. The aim is to get enough information to inform a discussion among interested parties on what might be offered as advanced training in typography. For example, I think there could be a linguistics course tailored to typographers interested in designing for languages they don&rsquo;t speak, without their becoming linguists (which certainly would bring the whole question of pre-reqs into play). What I&rsquo;m hearing is that almost everyone involved in typography today has taught themselves what they needed to know in many fields that their formal education did not cover. Typography is like the center of a web that touches many academic fields.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Craig, James, I don&rsquo;t believe there is enough typography taught in any bachelor program (with the possible exception of Reading&rsquo;s &ldquo;BA in Graphic Communication&rdquo; to go straight to PostGrad. This is not to disrespect the amount of typography that IS taught in design programs, but it is a small part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>And then, when one considers how broad the rubric of &ldquo;typography&rdquo; is, and that postgrad students may be coming from disciplines other than graphic design, such as behavioral science, linguistics, programming, computer engineering, business studies, art history, &amp;c., &amp;c., might it not be a good idea to have a taught undergraduate course in typography which covers those bases? And then indeed a student could progress from the general to the particular.</p>
<p>Juleit, can you have advanced training without basic training? You will end up with scientists who have no facility as typographers doing readability research with Arial and Mistral.</p>

I am assuming there would be admission guidelines to such a program which would ensure an adequate level of training to for the masters program. I hope you will be in LA to join in this discussion. I should also make clear that I am not affiliated with a university and am not setting up a program. This is purely research for a hypothetical program that hopefully wouldn&rsquo;t just replicate something that already exists elsewhere. We can dream, right?

<p>This would be an extremely specialized course, and one which probably has nothing to do with linguistic courses that are actually taught. Linguistics programmes cover a broad range of topics, but it is rare enough to find courses that merely deal with writing systems at all. Mainstream linguistics is mostly about identifying language universals these days (generative grammar and such); old-school linguistics was heavy on philology.</p>
<p>Why would anyone need to become a linguist to design for languages they don&rsquo;t speak? Do you mean for users of different languages but the same alphabet, like English speakers designing for Czech or Finnish? Or do you mean designing different scripts than one&rsquo;s own, like Devanagari or Chinese characters? In either case, one could learn the different design rules, and one could actually learn the languages themselves, but that is different from becoming a linguist. People might say &ldquo;linguist&rdquo; when they mean &ldquo;polyglot&rdquo;, but that is careless usage.</p>
<p>I have a feeling you might simply be referring to language courses. One could imagine a course for just teaching the Arabic script, not the spoken language. Is that what you are referring to?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At least a portion of my days as a recent college grad were spent re-running paragraph rags, identifying typefaces/&ldquo;cuts&rdquo;, and specifying display type spacing adjustments; skills that are now frequently automated at mediocre levels, the expertise of type historians, or often impossible to achieve online. Were these now obsolete trade skills like journeyman wood engraving, or stages on the way to higher level thinking and design? Do they even belong in undergraduate education at all, or are they better suited to on-the-job training where they may have value to someone seeking subtle detailing and the authority they project?</p>
<p>A hypothetical graduate program might embrace writing (whether stone cut, analog ink or digitally fleeting pixels) as communication design through letterforms, rather than just typography. I realize I&rsquo;m describing a program in architecture committed to teaching forestry, or at least wood joinery. The wider end of the funnel.</p>
<p>some answers:</p>
<p>Latin font design
Doesn&rsquo;t this begin with handwriting, and reading 3rd Grade handouts that were typed in Courier? Schooled at all levels, workshops, professional critique, self-taught.</p>
<p>Non-latin font design
Encountered cyrillic at the end of the Cold War, and non-latin since then at irregular intervals, critique from experts, and self-taught.</p>
<p>History of aesthetics of type design
See previous, formally in design study from undergraduate to graduate investigation, workshops, and self-taught.</p>
<p>History of technology of printing/type; Printing technology (offset, screen-to-laser), Hand printing (letterpress, printmaking)
Undergraduate, workshops, employment and participation in evolution of technology, self-taught. Letterpress is not hand printing in print history.</p>
<p>Calligraphy/Handlettering/Typesetting
Undergraduate, graduate investigation, workshops, professional training, self-taught</p>
<p>Quantitative reading research/Empirical research methods
Undergraduate, exposed to applications on-the-job, self-taught</p>

Yep, but I&rsquo;ve forgotten it.</p>
<p>Linguistics/Writing Systems
Small bits of exposure, self-taught</p>
<p>Graphic Design/Information Design/Book Design/Web Design
Undergraduate, graduate, self-teaching, workshops.
(Why are these last? Without them typography would not exist today. Not to mention Advertising, the incessant trumpet of trade.)</p>
<p>May I humbly suggest &ldquo;fine art&rdquo; as an overlooked category?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for your response, Peter. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of fine art, if only because it is so well covered in MFA programs, but I bet a fair number of typography people started out in fine art. I did myself. I think cross pollination could be a very healthy thing if, say, a university offered programs in both areas.</p>
<p>To your other comment: there is no implied importance to the order of topics. It was just a matter of getting down the more unusual things first so I wouldn&rsquo;t leave one out. The design disciplines came last because I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t forget them.</p>

<p>When I worked as a magazine art director, I became a very good editor since there was always an instance where a paragraph needed to be edited to improve the rag or lose a widow. I learned very quickly that if you brought the problem to the editor and asked them to re-write it, they would either refuse or have you wait. So I would re-write the problem passage and then show it to the editor for an ok. I alway got the ok.</p>

<p>Discovered drums at age 10, forgot about sketching; maintained a passive interest in letters.</p>
<p>In high school, I realized I could do &ldquo;cool things with fonts&rdquo; in Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>Majored in music in college, where I got to play Carnegie Hall, study music in India, and won a jazz award in Chicago and two DownBeat awards as a participant in the best recorded orchestral music category. Spent the majority of my non-academic time experimenting with Photoshop.</p>
<p>Brief career in music, growing interest and knowledge about type. Taught myself InDesign and Illy.</p>
<p>Started spending so much time with Adobe products (and getting good at them) I decided to try to make money using them.</p>
<p>Discovered that &ldquo;typography&rdquo; as a craft exists as a focus in the field of graphic design. Slowly honed/honing skills in type and design.</p>
<p>Full-time career in design (print and web), no longer playing music (actively).</p>
<p>My family doesn&rsquo;t understand me anymore.</p>
<p>In addition to the background survey, perhaps a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->psychological<!-- raw HTML omitted --> study of typographers and typophiles may be appropriate.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Christopher, my day job is as an in-house graphic designer for a national non-profit. Every academic semester we get lots of applicants for undergraduate intern positions. I have the fortune of being able to select the best one or two applicants for each semester. Yet, with a couple shining-star exceptions, many of these design students don&rsquo;t know a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about setting type (and almost <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nothing at all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about printing; I have had to thoroughly explain and demonstrate the concept of &ldquo;bleed&rdquo; to every intern I&rsquo;ve ever had here. Oh, right—type! I think I let my undergraduate program frustrations get the better of me&hellip;)</p>
<p>So, yes, I echo your thoughts about undergrad pedagogy and hope that, if any such survey exists, professors take heed!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you to everyone who responded. My experience has also been that typography is neglected in undergraduate design programs. However, when I have succeeded in getting a student to really get into type, there was no masters level program for them to go into in the U.S., and not all students can afford to go abroad. Since this node is now buried in the site, if anyone wants to respond to the survey later, please contact me directly at <a href="mailto:juliet@shendesign.com">juliet@shendesign.com</a></p>
