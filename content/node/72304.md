  and I was thinking about a work around with a particular issue regarding the font.
  I came up with a solution that in theory, I know works. It has to do with manipulating
  the font manually within a particular program (like InDesign or Corel). \r\n\r\nIt
  then occurred to me that it might be possible to create an OPENTYPE feature that
  performs the task automatically. I realize that for a new feature to come to fruition,
  it may take months if not years, but I think this is a very doable thing and it
  would solve some issues for a lot of type designers.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is,
  how does one go about having an OpenType Feature developed? Who should be contacted\u2014
  Adobe, Microsoft?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam Twardock\u2014 do you have an idea? I wanted
  to email you directly, since I thought you'd probably know the answer, but I couldn't
  find your email address.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nRL"

  body: "I do encourage you to discuss the idea openly. There's no IP attached to
    OpenType Layout features, and if you were to claim IP, e.g. a patent, you'd probably
    guarantee that the feature would never be supported anywhere. At most, I think
    you risk someone telling you that the idea is stupid, and I think that unlikely.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're simply shy, how about if I go first? These are a couple of OTL features
    that have been kicking around in my head recently:\r\n\r\n1. 'dcap' -- Drop Cap
    Forms\r\nGSUB feature. Accesses variant glyphs for use as drop caps. In some fonts
    these might be identical to 'titl' glyphs. In some fonts they might even be floriated
    or otherwise decorated initials. Enumerated variants (type 3 lookups) could be
    linked to drop caps of different sizes, e.g. two-line caps, three-line caps, etc.
    Feature would interact with application drop cap functions.\r\n\r\n2. 'rcxt' --
    Required Contextual Alternates\r\nGSUB feature. While may fonts include contextual
    alternate glyphs that are discretionary (typically on by default using the 'calt'
    feature but possible to turn off), there are some designs in which text is malformed
    if contextual alternates are not used. This feature would house contextual lookups
    that would be on by default and could not be turned off by the user. Obviously
    a font might contain a combination of 'rcxt' and 'calt' features. [I would have
    used this in the Gabriola font for MS if it has been available, and am working
    on another project for which it would be relevant.]"

  body: "Yes, I was a bit concerned that my idea was either already available, or
    impossible to do, thus, a stupid suggestion. But I have since spoken to a couple
    of people and it sounds like the feature isn't something that's possible.\r\n\r\n
    I hate getting warnings when I'm trying to do something that is somewhat unorthodox.
    And since I'm not a technical person, I don't know what my unorthodox steps would
    lead to with regard to problems. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, here is what I wanted
    to do. The issue is with ascenders and descenders extending past their parameters.
    If you want to make a font that has very long swashes that extend past the ascender
    and descender lines, when you generate the font, at least in FLAB, you get a warning.\r\n\r\nMy
    idea was to create an OPENTYPE feature that would allow you to create a glyph
    at half the size of the rest of the font, and then the feature would double whatever
    point size the user had assigned the font from within a program.\r\n\r\nOver 20
    years ago, when I first started making fonts with Fontographer, I discovered my
    own little trick for having characters extend past the boundaries without having
    them chopped off in PageMaker view. For example, if I wanted a swash letter y
    to extend far below the descender line, I would design it that way (ignoring the
    boundaries). I would then select the glyph cell from the main font window, and
    reduce it's size 50% (making sure that the metrics also reduced by half).\r\n\r\nI'd
    then generate the font, and begin using that \"y\" in my work. Of course it was
    only half size, so whenever it appeared, I would simply double the point size.
    For example, I would have a formal script and the text would be set at 36 point.
    If the bottom line of text had a \"y\" that I wanted to be a bit swashy and extend
    past the descender line, I would simply type in that alternate \"y\", and then
    make it 72 point. VIOLA! It appeared as it should, perfectly\u2014 and EVEN if
    the font was a script with connectors, it  lined up perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe feature
    would be called dubl (double character size). Or I suppose it could be called
    prct (for glyph at a percentage of size).\r\n\r\nLet's say the lower case characters
    will have extended ascenders/descender. I thought that to program it,  I would
    make two classes:\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[class]
    \r\ndubl01: b d h j k l p q y\r\n\r\n[class] \r\ndubl02: b.001 d.001 h.001  j
    .001  k .001 l .001  p .001  q .001  y .001\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen
    for the OpenType Feature, it would look something like this:\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature
    dubl { # Double Size Forms\r\n# Latin;\r\n\r\n    sub @dubl01 by @dubl02;\r\n}
    dubl;\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nThat
    was my idea... and all because I hate those silly warnings.\r\n\r\nRL\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Robert, I'm afraid your OTL 'dubl' idea won't work for a whole bunch of reasons.
    The notion of having half-scale glyph variants and them doubling the point size
    of the text setting is appears to make sense -- as you discovered when you implemented
    it manually in older fonts in PageMaker --, but it won't work in terms of OTL
    GSUB.\r\n\r\nOne problem is that OTL is applied to discrete glyph runs, and changes
    in point size are one of the criteria by which glyph runs are split. So as soon
    as you double the point size to scale up one of your half-scale variants you have
    lost all possibility of OTL interaction between this glyph and adjacent glyphs
    at the smaller point size. Basically, you'll be splitting individual words into
    multiple glyph runs.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that while this may appear to work
    in page layout applications with absolute leading values, any application applying
    linespacing as a multiple of either text point size or OS/2 or hhea table vertical
    metrics will produce different linespacing for any line involving the double-size
    glyphs. MS Word documents, for example, are going to look a terrible mess with
    different size glyphs interspersed amid the text. Sure, you might not use such
    applications, but a millions of people do and you're not going to get an OTL feature
    approved and supported that causes that kind of problem and potential support
    costs for application makers.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that if you set your OS/2
    vertical metrics values correctly, you don't actually need this proposed OTL feature.
    Clipping in TTF/OTF fonts is governed by the OS/2 table WinAscent and WinDescent
    values. So long as these are not smaller than your tallest glyphs, you should
    not experience any clipping. Most Windows applications also use these values to
    determine automatic line height, which means that fonts with very tall extenders
    will tend to have very wide linespacing in such applications, but at least they
    won't be clipping.\r\n\r\n[In theory, you can control automatic linespacing independently
    of no-clipping zones, using the OS/2 Typo metrics and the fsSelection bit 7 setting
    that tells an application to use these metrics instead of the Win metrics for
    linespacing calculation, but in practice there isn't a lot of support for this.
    It is still worth doing, however, if you have a font with very large Win metrics,
    because the latter will otherwise also be used to scale the font sample in the
    Word font menu, resulting in visually very small menu entry.]"
