  signs as a key element of the text. The feedback's come back that the neutral and
  and minus sign aren't sufficiently distinct and I'm trying to find a typographically
  sensitive way to differentiate them more without committing a heinous crime against
  the font. Could I use a little vertical scaling on the neutral sign and still sleep
  at night? If so, how much might I get away with at small sizes (10.5pt Plantin)?\r\n\r\nNormally
  I'd be loathed to meddle in this way (especially as the characters seem sufficiently
  distinct already to me eye), but I fear it might be a lesser evil in the long run!
  I have looked at different fonts for all three signs but that could be a can of
  worms scenario, and in any case I suspect the neutral and minus signs would still
  be considered too similar in other fonts. I've also tried drawing my own neutral
  sign, but that's not been very convincing so far!\r\n\r\nAny thoughts much appreciated\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: 'I wouldn''t try something like scaling. I would substitute the sign(s) with
    ones from a specialized math/scientific font or, in any case, with one that offer
    a non-contrast monoline version of the non-diacritical tilde (a "generic sorts"
    version, so to speak). See, just for example, Garamond Premier: http://myfonts.us/td-QpS08i'

    think I've found something that will satisfy in a maths font. Hope they go for
    it!"
