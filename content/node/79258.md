  Ali haiki, for accounting and finance services (financial controlling, accounting,
  audit, business plans and strategies). IT has to be, clean, simple,young, shows
  professionalism and seriousness, but still firendly not aggressive.\r\n\r\nHere's
  what I've reached. \r\n\r\nMy experience in design is still little, but this is
  to enrich my experience and enhance my portfolio, so every comment is appreciated.
  Thanks!\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n"

  body: "- Why the period?\r\n\r\nThe company does all accounting services from A-Z.
    So it can help you to reach final results to aid you future plans. So the dots
    have moved to the end ( Final results) smoothly and flawlessly. \r\n\r\n- The
    tight spacing makes the A_l gap more evident.\r\n\r\nYeah. the A is causing problems,
    obviously. I like the typeface though. I tried to make the spacing bigger, but
    it looks totally different then.\r\nDo you suggest anything else?\r\n\r\n- Not
    sure about the dotless i.\r\nNot readable?"

  body: "Trying to loosen spacing a bit could improve the flow.\r\nRegarding A, you
    could try a slanted one, with a vertical right stem.\r\nIf the period is part
    of the logo, the byline should be centered accordingly.\r\nMy gripe with dotless
    i is that it draws attention on something missing, which I\u2019m not sure is
    desirable for accounting ;-) "

    huge. when using it in a smaller scale it is fine. In the end it will probably
    never be used in that size :)\r\n\r\n@ riccardo & T\xE9 Rowan - This company will
    be working with companies who don't want to hire an accountant. A company who
    want to outsource one. About the dotless i,  think if Ali Haiki is readable without
    it, then that's exactly what I meant. The dot in the end draws attention to the
    missing dots and only then, it makes sense. :) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Sorry if I wasn't clear (and perhaps a bit too snarky), but I meant that it
    appears that the dot of the /i/ fell off the top and landed to it's right as a
    period.  I find that to lack the reassurance that I expect from an accountant.

  body: "I think in the beginning, you were saying \"clean and simple\" and so with
    that in mind...\r\n\r\nI think you've decided to put the dots back on the \"i's\"
    which is a wise move. I think because the name of the company is not a normal
    english word, it's important to dot your \"i's\" so to speak. Perhaps try it in
    the same color, you know, for cleanliness.\r\n\r\nI'm not thrilled about the biline
    font. perhaps try a sans serif font for the biline. Perhaps make it all caps so
    it's nice and blocky. Specifically, it's the two \"A's in ALI and Accounting that
    aren't working together. Also, the ampersand is sort of jutting up and creating
    weird tension between the two lines of the logo.\r\n\r\nHowever, I DO like the
    two blues together. Perhaps once you choose the font for the biline, make it one
    of your lighter blues. Where you have the two blues and the gray isn't working
    for simplicity.\r\n"
