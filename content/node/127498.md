  with the slight slant changed to be vertical?  That's how it appears when you zoom
  in.  I'm curious, because I can imagine some situations where one might wish to
  use a font like Syntax, but the slant is not desired.  Yet Syntax is rather popular,
  while I never see Symphony mentioned anywhere.\r\n"

    with the slant removed. I wonder if this was a renamed version (although I suspect
    it's earlier)."
