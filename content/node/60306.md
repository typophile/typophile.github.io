    http://new.myfonts.com/search/gothic+13/fonts/ \r\nthe circular full stop is a
    mystery, everything similar ive found has square full stops....also check out
    the tailless G here (sorry for the bad quality scan)....\r\n\r\nany other ideas
    anyone?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dh3_5462.jpg]"

  body: "Red Rooster's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/gothic-rr/medium-condensed/|Gothic
    Medium Condensed]] seems to match pretty well, including the G, although the leg
    of the R is not quite the same. If the square period bothers you, you can replace
    it.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
