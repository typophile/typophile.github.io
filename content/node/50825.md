body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI' ve been working in a typeface for some time now and
  came up with a question that I dont know how to awnser it!\r\nThe [[ogonek]] that
  appears in the default enconding in fontlab is just one drawing. \r\nI found several
  articles here where this subject is discussed and lots of fonts here all letters
  are draw. \r\nMy question is this: \r\nDoes the ogonek itself, that appears in the
  default enconding in fontlab, is enough?\r\nOr should I draw all letters that use
  it? By the way, where can I find this list?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nAnt\xF3nio

    a list you can do a search for ogonek on http://www.decodeunicode.org/ (The results
    are clickable).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ogonek_3676.png]"

  body: "It also depends on which languages your font should support. E.g. Polish
    uses only Aa and Ee with ogonek. But then you also need to draw the other special
    characters for Polish.\r\n\r\nLithuanian uses Aa, Ee, Ii and Uu with ogonek, but
    likewise to support Lithuanian, you also would need c with acute, c with caron,
    e with dot, s with caron, u with macron and z with caron.\r\n\r\nI don't know
    which language uses the o with ogonek and the o with ogonek and macron."

  body: There are a few American Indian languages that use the O with ogonek and some
    other rare diacritics. I can't recall which ones off-hand.
