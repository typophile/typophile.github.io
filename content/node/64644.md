body: "Hi typeophiles\r\n\r\nI am looking for a san serif display font that works
  well with scotch modern bold italic ... to use with a magazine masthead. I've attached
  our fashion & lifestyle magazine cover, Scoop Magazine, so you can see the Scotch
  font mast. One of our other titles is Scoop Traveller. We need to use the Scoop
  mast the same way but to incorporate Traveller below that and I am having trouble
  finding a good san serif display font that works well with it. Hence I am visiting
  you lot as you've always had great suggestions for me in the past. Any suggestions
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: If that's Nick Shinn's Scotch Modern, you got lucky &ndash; Figgins Sans (which
    Riccardo linked to) was specifically designed as a "team partner" to it!

  body: Yes it is Scotch Modern, and I've used the bold italic for the mast, with
    a little shortening of the p descender and kerned quite tight. Thanks for the
    suggestion, I would never have known that!
