  driver. (For all those who haven't seen it, yes, my description is drab, but I wouldn't
  want to give much away to what I think was a great film and definitely worth the
  watch.)\r\n\r\nEven if you haven't seen it, you may have noticed the promo material:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pyromag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Drive-Poster.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  hot pink type just jumps out really. Any guesses as to what the typeface is? Well,
  during the title sequence screening, this type was used consistently for all the
  actor's names etc; and I could've sworn it was Mistral by Excoffon, which I did
  found a bit strange having recently read the great article by Matt Soar about Mistral
  being quite prolific in Montreal of all places. So I came back to do a bit of google-rooting
  to see if it's been mentioned at all. Then on further comparing this: \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Drive2011Poster.jpg
  \r\n\r\nwith Mistral, it \"r\" definitely doesn't look the same, but regardless
  the rest (including first image link) are pretty much identical to the French face.
  I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else shared by surprise in seeing this old
  gem still appear in a current film. "
