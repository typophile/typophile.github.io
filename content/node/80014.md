body: "Consider a scenario wherein a financial services business wants a postcard
  to send to their clients, their clients being other businesses and organizations
  in the financial and legal fields; the postcard announces their new level of certification
  which qualifies them for handling specialized financial services. As a marketing
  piece it should communicate an attitude of: \"We aren't a big business, but we are
  absolutely professional, have decades of experience, and the service you'll get
  with us will be top quality, creative, and personal.\" \r\n\r\nObviously there are
  many types one could employ here, but consider this one artificial constraint: it
  is to be either FF Scala Sans or Atlanta. One or the other. Without poisoning the
  well, I can say that I'm not so much seeking guidance \u2014 I already know what
  I think \u2014 as I am curious for anecdata of a consensus of expert opinion. So,
  if you had to choose between the two, which one would it be?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_01_4922.jpg]"

  body: "Who makes Atlanta? It looks to be just a knock-off of Avant Garde with a
    few minor changes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, aside from Atlanta looking really dated, I don\u2019t
    think it looks all that professional. The upper and lowercase S in Avant Garde
    have always bugged me. They're so narrow that they look like a mistake. To me,
    those characters alone make the whole font look cheap.\r\n\r\nTo me, Scala Sans
    looks much more professional, much more clean, and much more modern, without being
    trendy or gimmicky.\r\n\r\nI guess Atlanta/Avant Garde only implies \"decades
    of experience\" in that it might look like the postcard was designed decades ago,
    in the 1970s, when Avant Garde was first popular.\r\n\r\n"

    original S's are much wider.\r\nWhy would that company produce what is obviously
    a knock-off, yet cock up several characters? (R, S, s, y)\r\nAs noted in a recent
    thread, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, than a bad imitation is
    no flattery at all."

  body: "I don't know. I felt that Scala Sans looked too much like other popular typefaces
    (Lucida, Stone) of the present day that people wouldn't notice it, whereas Atlanta
    would look more comfortable to the intended audience of people who are not typographic
    experts.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd expect bankers to use would be, say, Caslon, or Helvetica
    Extra Light (but <strong>not</strong> Futura) if the two faces shown were being
    considered. The shape of h, m, n, and q in Scala Sans looks uncomfortably unconventional.\r\n\r\nSo,
    basically, the reason for my dissenting opinion is the fact that the question
    asked was, \"which typeface is more suitable for this specific application\",
    and not \"which typeface has more typographical props\"."

    is at least against Atlanta. \r\nBut you're right, design decisions should be

  body: "@ricard0:\r\nBut I'm not so much rooting for Atlanta as noting that the reasons
    for choosing FF Scala Sans over Atlanta seem to be related to an extrinsic factor
    not really related to fitness for the specific purpose. Now, a \"good quality\"
    typeface is always better than a \"poor quality\" typeface, and so typographic
    cred does matter... but since that seemed to be almost the only factor discussed...\r\n\r\nit
    seemed to me that most of the people rooting for FF Scala Sans would have, as
    far as one could tell by their responses in this thread...\r\n\r\nopted for a
    genuine authentic version of Cooper Black over a cheap imitation knock-off of
    Times Roman...\r\n\r\nif someone asked for a suggestion for a text typeface.\r\n\r\nThat
    isn't actually fair, since the current application is a text typeface, and one
    of the reasons given for rejecting Atlanta is because it resembles Avant Garde,
    a <em>display</em> typeface. So suitability to purpose was, in fact, considered
    by some. What surprised me, though, is how little it figured in the comments compared
    to the issue of typographic authenticity."

  body: "Just to reiterate, I was wondering over the possibility of a general consensus
    among informed, knowledgeable, experienced designers and typophiles in an admittedly
    constrained example. This is not the same as asking Google and the subjectivity
    of taste does not preclude the importance of earned and informed judgment. As
    I originally said, I already know what I think \u2014 I'm interested to know what
    you think.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a fair point that quadbloc raises about the situational
    criteria. It is possible to conceive of an appropriate use for even the most hideous
    font (perhaps a postcard advertising hideous fonts!); the question here is which
    font would you proceed with based on this imperfect information?"
