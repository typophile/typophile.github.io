  cyrillic glyphs to a font I made called [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/anivers.html|Anivers]].
  Because cyrillic is not familiar to me I would very much appreciate some input on
  this. Spacing and kerning still need to be done...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I don't think this set complements your original style of Anivers. It has
    some poetic strokes in it. Basically only letters that are the same in both alphabest
    hold that. All the others are rather much more geometric. A tweak here an there
    and I think it could be a nice complement to your Roman set.

    commenting. I think you're right, but because many lc glyphs are based on uppercase
    shapes I find it difficult to let cyrillic complement the Roman set. Above the
    glyphs I've adapted. (The 2nd pdf is in the openings post... I don't know how
    to attach a pdf to this comment...)"

  body: "Well that's much better. I find them more part of the family now. Regarding
    the breaking the box rule. I guess you should stay just as much in the box as
    you did with your Roman set which is quite geometric bust still a little bit humanist.\r\n\r\nI
    like your latest change. Especially the changes on the upper case."

  body: "very nice, voobshche!\r\na couple concerns:\r\nthe body of the \u0424 is
    nice and large, but the main stroke endings (top and bottom) are likely to get
    lost at smaller sizes. this stroke can actually overshoot the cap height line
    and the baseline and will generally improve the appearance of this glyph.\r\nthe
    arms on \u0416\u041A\u0436\u043A seem splayed a bit too much to me. if the diagonals
    could be a bit more upright, i think these glyphs would look better. the \u0436
    looks a bit extra wide in the lower case, but i seem to always make mine too narrow,
    so it might be just right.\r\nthe upper bowl on the \u044F could be a bit larger.\r\n\r\n"

    your input. I've adapted \u0424\u0416\u041A and \u044F. \u0436\u043A just a fraction.
    \r\nI guess when I made the screen of the PDF the \u0451 was not ready yet :)\r\nThere's

  body: "oh, i like it, Jos!\r\n\r\ni prefer your previous rectangular lc forms, because
    they have some \"wave\" a bit corresponding to latin lc. please give more play
    over them, and more play with center-crossed lowercases like -\u0432-\u044F-\u0437-
    maybe something like your -a- or -e- forms? \r\n\r\nyou can make left leg in -\u043B-
    (and -\u0434-) more flowing, and make diagonal in -\u0438-\u0439- (and even horizontal
    in -\u043D-) less geometric. \r\n\r\n-\u043C- looks unclear for me, -\u041F-\u043F-
    looks too wide, -\u0423- and -\u042F- looks too narrow, -\u0431- looks old-timed,
    -\u0419-\u0439- be better with a bit bigger breve. \r\n\r\nmaybe right oval in
    -\u0444- will be better if you mirror them? maybe top of oval in -\u044C- can
    follow -b-? and you can animate tails in -\u0446-\u0449-\r\n\r\nsorry for my english
    and good luck with this beauty!"

    be a bit longer, the whitespace above the bowl larger, the bowl shorter. The \u0418

  body: "I like first \u0431 better. I don't particularly like your \u0436 (I guess
    \u044F and \u043A are still also the problem), it is very weak at the bottom and
    bold at the top. I think you should entirely redesign the relation between the
    lower legs and the top parts in \u0436, \u044F and \u043A (both UC and lc). \r\n\r\nI
    think \u043B and \u0434 are not a bit better, though still not balanced enough.
    The \"shelf\" in \u0434 is still too short \u2014 it realy needs to be visible
    in small sizes. The LEFT edge of the right tooth in \u0434 should be located slightly
    to the RIGHT of the RIGHT edge of the right stem of \u0434. In other words, the
    right tooth of \u0434 should be clearly off limits of the right stem of that letter.
    \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"
