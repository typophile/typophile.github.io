  body: "Seems to be along the Trajan lines, bot more hand-lettered like. The serifs
    definitely show signs of hand-lettering, but the R's seem identical. The O has
    a very pronounced left slanting bias (more so than the G)  and is uneven in weight.\r\n\r\nIf
    you just need to get close look up \"Trajan\" in MyFonts and browse around.\r\nGood
    Luck,\r\nStephen"
