  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am being specific to the typeface / font design sector on this forum though this concerns all nonprofit organisations.  I am not happy with nonprofit organisations giving out salaries and wages to any staff.  The donors monies should not be used to pay for salaries or de facto salaries.  Thus the word nonprofit is a bit too broad and a distinction should be included for educating that a particular nonprofit is also nonsalary, e.g. &lsquo;A Nonsalary-Nonprofit organisation&rsquo;.  This should educate and help to understand that the nonprofit is serious in it&rsquo;s objectives.  I find it objectionable and corrupt that nonprofit organisations are paying salaries, de facto salaries to staff and there are even salaried nonprofit careers.  The nonprofit activity is about doing things without any personal financial gain.  When you have nonprofit organisations, employment agencies putting salaries on nonprofit jobs, websites listing nonprofit jobs with salaries, it is all quite revolting.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You are confusing &lsquo;non-profit&rsquo; and &lsquo;volunteer&rsquo;. Profit is a particular accumulation of income above expenses, including the expenses of paying wages to people who do work and who, unless they are volunteers, are entitled to a fair wage for the work that they do. As James explains, non-profit organisations are those that do not seek to make or retain such surplus income; there is nothing to say that a non-profit organisation should not gainfully employ people in the pursuit of its non-profit goals. It is the organisation that is non-profit, not the workers. Most often, the decision whether to use volunteers or paid workers comes down to effectiveness: is an organisation more or less effective in pursuit of its non-profit goals if it relies on volunteers or pays people to work? Or, as Nick points out, an organisation that becomes effective through volunteer labour may find that it needs to employ wage earners in order to remain effective or to become more effective. For obvious reasons, the attrition or &lsquo;burn-out&rsquo; rate among volunteers is generally higher than among paid workers.</p>
<p>Of course, there are possibilities for true corruption in this system, but there is nothing inherently corrupt about non-profit organisations paying workers. There are also possibilities for corruption in volunteer organisations, which may turn out to be generating income and hence profit from the labour of unpaid workers.</p>

<p>@ James Michaels / John Hudson:  What it should mean and what it is speculated to mean is a problem.  Nonprofit should also mean Nonsalary.  There is an ingrained problem with meanings / interpretations in value and moral spheres, e.g. &lsquo;Thou Shall Not Kill&rsquo; is often considered to mean only humans and does not include animals.  This is wrong.  It should also include land, see and air animals.  Similarly &lsquo;Nonprofit&rsquo; should mean &lsquo;Nonsalary.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I understand your point. I know several instances where non-profit businesses were established that never made a declared profit, but have been enormously profitable to those who started the business through salaries. However I disagree that non-profits shouldn’t be able to help hire people to help fulfill the mission. Too many good deeds are done by charitable non-profits with hired hands.</p>
<p>These are non-typographic related, but the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the RedCross and others come to mind quickly. Locally here in Memphis we have St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. They pay some pretty hefty salaries to research physicians, administrators, as well as marketers, housekeepers and thousands of others, yet it is a non-profit organization. All income is put back into the mission of eliminating catastrophic childhood diseases. The progress they have made over the last several decades is stunning. You’re saying that all of those thousands of people working on that mission should live in poverty or the work they do just not be done? Or do you think St. Jude should be considered a profitable organization just like Exxon-Mobil?</p>
<p>I get your point, but the totalitarian statement that non-profit should therefore mean non-salary would do more harm than good. It’s up to donors to provide the due diligence and review the legitimacy of the entity and check the organizational efficiency, review the operating and administrative costs. There is and will always be abuse, but the fix isn’t to force the elimination of the work the good organizations are doing.</p>
<p>And like DA, I&rsquo;m still missing what this has to do with the typography business.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Nonprofit should also mean Nonsalary.</em></p>
<p>So you assert. Assertion does not make it so. Where is your analysis? Here is mine:</p>
<p>There are for-profit organisations that seek to generate surplus income that constitutes accumulated capital, which may be disposed of according to the will of owners or shareholders.</p>
<p>There are non-profit organisations that do not seek to generate surplus income or that direct such surplus income back into supporting the non-profit goals of the organisation.</p>
<p>There is for-wage labour, which is a commodity sold by workers in order to provide for their livelihood and to support their families. [There is a long and important discussion possible on the terms under which labour is bought and sold, but it isn&rsquo;t necessary to this analysis.]</p>
<p>There is non-wage labour that is freely offered by the workers, i.e. volunteer labour, expecting no payment. [There is also non-wage labour that is not freely offered, i.e. slave labour.]</p>
<p>Now, it should be clear from this that we&rsquo;re talking about two different things: the business model under which the organisation pursues its goals &ndash; whether those goals involve profit or not &ndash;, and the business model under which the worker makes his or her labour available to the organisation &ndash; whether for a wage or not. The organisation is not the worker, and the worker is not the organisation. The worker is a man or woman who is providing his or her labour to the organisation, whether selling that labour or offering it freely. Labour is a commodity, and if you want to really grasp the implications of this for your assertion, consider whether a non-profit organisation might reasonably pay rent for the property it occupies, or whether it might pay for the electricity it uses, or whether it might pay for the computers that it uses? All these things could be donated for free by supporters of the organisation&rsquo;s goals &ndash; and often they are &ndash; just as labour may be donated by volunteers, but equally they must often be paid for by the organisation, just as labour must often be paid for.</p>
<p>That is my conclusion: there is no fixed correlation between the business model of an organisation and the business model of labour provided to that organisation. A non-profit organisation may employ paid workers or volunteers or, as James points out, some combination of the two. Likewise, a for-profit organisation does not automatically imply paid labour; that is the norm in our societies, but there are plenty of places in the world in which non-volunteer unpaid labour (slavery) is still found, and cases of indentured (compelled) labour, especially involving immigrant workers, are regularly uncovered in our own societies despite laws against such practices.</p>
<p>The only time when there is a direct correlation between the business model of an organisation and the business model of labour is when the worker owns the means of production, and earns his livelihood not from selling his labour but directly from the fruits of that labour. That&rsquo;s how I run my own business, but that&rsquo;s another topic&hellip;</p>

<p>@ Darrel Austin / David Kimball / Paul Phillips (and others) :  Regarding certain typography (or similar)  organisation examples or what this internet forum posting thread has to do with typography (or similar).  There are typography (or similar) Nonprofit-calling organisations, thus it is relevant.  I am sure that some typographers (or graphic designers) also are / have done projects for Nonprofit-calling organisations.  Perhaps some even have done courses etc run by Nonprofit-calling organisations.  Typographers (graphic designers) also donate funds to Nonprofit-calling organisations.  There is also Nonprofit-calling organisation font license used by typographers and those who commission typography projects.  Thus this thread is relevant.</p>
<p>@ Dan Hall / James Michaels :  Nonprofit the word (and similar) has a certain meaning and it should not be exploited in it&rsquo;s meaning.  Sadly it has been.  Materialistic governments have given their own meaning to this word.  Donors have also been exploited as a result. There has been a covering put by misusing, leaching and licensing the word Nonprofit and similar.  Those Nonprofit-calling organisations that are paying salaries to have things done, should state it explicitly that they are paying salaries to staff.  Why hide this information from their letterhead or footer statement?  Should not governments put a law for this to happen etc?</p>
<p>@ John Hudson :  We first need to understand that the word Nonprofit (and similar) has been exploited (see above)  and if an organisation is using this word then it must be honest.  It needs to state that it is for-salary or pays them and it is not 100 percent Nonprofit. The so-called Nonprofit or the Nonprofit-calling organisation is deciding whether it pays salaries or not.  It should state it explicitly as it does when it says that it is a Nonprofit.  In the USA, the words 501(c), see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)]] &ndash; are used quite often to describe a Nonprofit-calling organisation and they use it often for donations.  They should state it there that they pay salaries and thus they are not 100 percent Nonprofit or that they are Semi-Nonprofit.</p>

<p>Of course any non-profit organisation should be transparently open in disclosing whether or not it pays either salaries to its officers or wages to its workers, and most countries require that by law of non-profit organisations. But whether they pay or do not pay officers or workers does not affect their status as non-profit organisations. They are not rendered ‘not 100% non-profit’ or ‘semi-non-profit’ because they pay salaries or wages. Once again: the organisation and the people who work for it are not the same thing; it is the organisation that is non-profit, the people who work for it may be volunteers or wage earners without affecting the status of the organisation.</p>
<p>Consider several different non-profit organisations:</p>
<p>Organisation A discloses that it does not pay any salaries to its officers and uses only volunteer labour.</p>
<p>Organisation B discloses that it pays a salary to its executive director, a full-time position, but not to other officers who are part-time volunteers; it pays a wage to the secretary/receptionist, but not to various other volunteer workers who come in a couple of days each week to help out.</p>
<p>Organisation C discloses that it does not pay any salaries to its officers, pays wages to some workers, e.g. secretary and the IT staff, but does not pay wages to the volunteers who come in once a month to stuff envelopes.</p>
<p>Organisation D pays a salary to its full-time executive director, a stipend to its other officers, and an hourly wage to employees.</p>
<p>But despite these very different disclosed models of paying or not paying individuals for their time and labour, <em>these are all non-profit organisations,</em> because as organisations they do not seek to generate surplus income to be disposed of beyond expenses at the will of owners or shareholders. That is the criterion of a non-profit organisation, not whether the people who work for it are paid.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Corporate-ising&rsquo; a word or claiming special ownership of it does not change it from it&rsquo;s ordinary usage and meaning.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, but you are the one who is trying to assert a special, un-ordinary and uncommon usage and meaning of the term ‘non-profit’, a term that I have demonstrated &ndash; <em>demonstrated,</em> mind you, by analysis, not merely asserted &ndash; is independent of the renumeration of labour. The common meaning and usage of non-profit refers to the activities and financial model of organisations that do not seek to create profit and which, if they create a working profit inadvertently, must recycle that profit into the operation of the organisation. This in contrast to a for-profit enterprise, which exists in order to create profit that may be withdrawn from the organisation by owners or shareholders. You are trying to assert a contrast between non-profit and salary-paying; this is a false contrast because salaries are not profit, they are expenses. The valid contrast is between non-profit and for-profit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ Theunis de Jong :  We are discussing seriously on a topic that is serious.  The k/K alteration to another shape is another topic that has been discussed on this forum.</p>
<p>@ John Hudson :  With due respect to your postings, your latest is basically a repeat.  I am requesting that you go beyond the corporate-ist meaning and it&rsquo;s ownership by certain groups and individuals.  When so-called Nonprofit organisation according to 501(c) (in the USA) is saying that they are a Nonprofit and requesting donations, they should state in toto whether they are paying salaries.  Nonprofit should mean Nonsalary.  If the so-called Nonprofit organisation is paying salaries to anyone then it is not 100 percent Nonprofit.  It is a &lsquo;mixture&rsquo; that could be expressed as Semi-Nonprofit.</p>
<p>It is not just a USA issue.  Even in Britain the same thing is happening where Charities are claiming they are charitable even when they are giving salaries.  The Nonprofit word has been manipulated to include salaries, this is a form of money laundering.  It has occurred more as governments have become materialistic, corporate-ist and secular based.  I detect some barriers in our discussion where the actual common meaning and symbolism of the Nonprofit word is being ignored.  I requested the Charity Commission in England (who govern registered charities) under the Freedom of  Information Act to provide me figures for salaries that charities are paying.  By the way the Charity Commission also publicises their accounts on it&rsquo;s website, [[http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk]].  They told me that they could not provide the figures and I would have to get figures myself individually for each charity.  Here is a government funded agency who cannot provide this basic information.  What this suggests is that they want to ignore the salaries issue and want to manipulate the true meaning of the word Nonprofit that is also Nonsalary.</p>
<p>A progressive move for a real Nonprofit organisation would be to put on it&rsquo;s header or footer for e.g. &lsquo;A Nonsalary-Nonprofit organisation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>@ Dave Crossland :  Please research so-called Nonprofit organisations in your sector via perhaps the internet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>‘Javascript’, you are the one who is repeating himself and not offering anything new to the discussion other than asserting, again, that ‘Nonprofit should mean Nonsalary’. I have demonstrated by analysis why these are two concepts that can and do exist independently of each other. How else could we meaningfully describe a for-profit organisation that was also non-salary? Indeed, if non-profit meant non-salary, why would we bother having two terms at all? We have these two different terms because they refer to two different things.</p>
<p>If you are claiming that there exists corruption in some organisations and that paying of salaries by non-profit organisations is being used as a means of money laundering, that is surely true. These things happen, and it is to combat these things that laws require non-profit organisations to disclose their budgets, and why some organisations become the subject of investigation for fraud. So, given that this is the case, that laws are deemed needful to enable to monitoring and investigation of non-profit organisations to ensure that they are <em>not</em> laundering money or defrauding donors, you might ask why it is that the law also permits non-profit organisations to pay salaries to their officers and wages to their workers? <em>It is because this has been proven over time to increase the effectiveness of many organisations in the pursuit of their</em> non-profit <em>goals.</em> In this as in other areas, the law permits the risk of abuse in order to also permit a greater good.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ Nick Shinn / Beau W / John Hudson / Dan Hall :  I have in the past volunteered part time for Nonprofit organisations that I realise now were so-called Nonprofit organisations only.  I was not paid a salary by them I am glad to say.  I have had to really put my ears to the ground and understand the Nonprofit word should mean Nonsalary as there is so much rubbish propaganda by so-called Nonprofit organisations who are paying salaries to their staff.  Thus I understand their influencing you on this forum as sadly this rubbish propaganda influenced me in my decisions in the past.  You might have created some fonts or logos etc for them also so as to influence others with their communication.</p>
<p>In a way those so-called Nonprofit organisations who are paying salaries are funding private lifestyles and thwarting their Nonprofit objects, vision and mission.  Thus for them to have salaries they need bad things happening in societies to put their case for giving salaries.  This formula sustains them it can argued.  So they are &lsquo;under-the-scene&rsquo; [insider shipping] subtly friendly with &lsquo;baddies&rsquo; that they claim &lsquo;on-the-scene&rsquo; to society at-large are &lsquo;enemies&rsquo;.  This is because &lsquo;baddies&rsquo; are in a way giving opportunity to them to get a salary.</p>
<p>Another issue for so-called Nonprofits is outsourcing their particular duties to other companies, individuals and organisations.  This could be said to be de facto salaries.  In Britain the word &lsquo;Chuggers&rsquo; is being mentioned by public and also the media to criticise so-called Nonprofit organisations.  What this particular word means etc can be read from for e.g.:</p>
<p>[[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12525580]] &ndash; 
22 February 2011  &lsquo;Chuggers&rsquo; or face-to-face street fundraisers?</p>
<p>[[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7966571/Chugger-premiums-can-swallow-donations.html]]
27 Aug 2010  &lsquo;Chugger&rsquo; premiums can swallow donations</p>
<p>[[http://www.i-volunteer.org.uk/newshound/how-much-do-chuggers-cost/]]
27th August 2010 How much do chuggers cost?</p>
<p>Thus those so-called Nonprofit organisations who internally pay salaries to staff are also Chuggers albeit &lsquo;internal&rsquo; Chuggers and if they outsource their fundraising or other duties to others for which money or commission is paid by them then they are both &lsquo;internal and external&rsquo; Chuggers or &lsquo;Double Chuggers.&rsquo;</p>

So you have volunteered, but have you ever tried to organize?
I&rsquo;ve been involved with a number of clubs and organizations, and it is sooo difficult to make the bridge from an impassioned start-up, fuelled by volunteers, to a durable institution. The founders get burned out, and then what? Without putting someone on the payroll, the organization will wither.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have a society where reformers and critics are consigned to the role of pesky, short-lived gadflies.
How to you propose to maintain an organization capable of serious and sustained contributions, such as Amnesty, WWF, Medecins Sans Frontiers or Greenpeace, without salaried workers? How do you propose to raise funds for a website or printed materials to spread the word, or distribute contributions? These organizations have to compete with corporate marketing of consumer products and services, and companies that use cause marketing, hiring professionals to create campaigns which hit you up for cash at the supermarket check-out.</p>
<p>Like it or not, this is the 21st century, not the 19th, when wealthy wives not admitted into the workforce were the do-gooders. 
It will be interesting to see how David Cameron&rsquo;s great leap backwards from the welfare state works out, as well as similar events in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Yep, I&rsquo;ve seen many instances of highly devoted people burning out. In fact I&rsquo;m sometimes wary of volunteers who seem overeager, as I figure they&rsquo;re more likely to burn out and move on.  Folks who devote smaller amounts of time are often better at staying in it for the long haul.</p>
<p>In some cases I suspect it&rsquo;s an adrenaline-rush kind of thing. People get involved in a new cause and it&rsquo;s exciting at first, but when things start settling down into a dull routine they move on.</p>

For example, there&rsquo;s a women&rsquo;s club in my town that used to have hundreds of members, mostly homemakers, and they were constantly doing volunteer work. These days their membership has dwindled down to mostly just retirees. Most of the younger women have full-time careers.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s come at this from the opposite tack. Does — or should — non-salary mean non-profit? Well, clearly it doesn&rsquo;t because there are all too many examples of for-profit enterprises, throughout history and still today, not paying salaries or wages to the people who do the work. And if non-salary were to mean non-profit then we would need to come up with new words to describe such enterprises. Again we see the essential independence of the profit orientation of an enterprise (for profit vs non-profit) from the remuneration of its workers (salaried or waged vs volunteer or slave). Again, the organisation is not the worker and the worker is not the organisation.</p>
<p>I do not disagree with you at all the non-profit organisations should transparently disclose a) that they pay salaries to their officers and wages to their workers and b) what percentage of their revenues are disposed in this way. This is, in fact, pretty standard practice under law in many jurisdictions that formally recognise non-profit organisations for legal and tax purposes. What I disagree with is your idiosyncratic insistence that these non-profit organisations are in some sense not really non-profit or only semi-non-profit. They are non-profit organisations that pay their workers, and that does not make them non-profit, since paying salaries and wages is an <em>expense.</em></p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m donating money to an organisation, one of the first things I want to know about the organisation, apart from its goals, is what percentage of its revenues are disposed in administrative costs, including salaries, wages, rents, etc. As a rule of thumb, I avoid giving to organisations that expend more than 10% of revenues on administrative costs. These are costs, not profits, and my concern is not that they impinge in any way on the non-profit orientation of the organisation &ndash; they do not &ndash;, but that this percentage represents a measure of how efficient and effective the organisation is in pursuing its goals.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Note also that administrative costs, which includes salaries and wages paid to officers of the organisation and its workers, do not include expenditures in direct pursuit of the goals of the organisation. So, for example, if a non-profit organisation exists in order to enable production of some thing, e.g. a collection of fonts, that will be made freely available, on a non-profit basis, to the public, it is quite within the mandate of that organisation to pay someone to create those fonts, or to pay to purchase the rights to fonts, because that is the goal of the organisation. Yes, this means that the person who creates the fonts is profiting, but he is profiting from the products of his labour, just as if he were creating the fonts for any other client, and his labour is &ndash; or should be &ndash; entirely independent of the non-profit organisation. He is profiting, not the non-profit organisation.</div>

<p>I understand that you want retainers and steady timely regular payments though it is different  doing this with an organisation claiming they are Nonprofit, Philanthropic-funded or Charitable etc and at the same time they are giving salaries to staff and de facto salaries to others or yourselves.  They are diluting the meaning of the Nonprofit word, they are cheating the system and you could be enabling them  by doing projects for them.</p>
<p>Are the Police the &lsquo;zig&rsquo; or the &lsquo;zag&rsquo; in this &lsquo;zig-zag&rsquo; society  called a Nonprofit organisation?  Not here in Britain based on my experience.  Then why should another &lsquo;alt.-Police&rsquo;, another &lsquo;zig&rsquo; or &lsquo;zag&rsquo; in this &lsquo;zig-zag&rsquo; society be de facto calling itself 100 percent Nonprofit when they are paying salaries?  The Police are paid salaries and these are funded by governments or are generally and they carry out necessary things for society and they are not called Nonprofit organisation.  These &lsquo;alt-Police&rsquo; organisations they do their necessary things for which they are not always funded by governments or fully by governments. Some are referred as NGO or Non-Governmental Organisations, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization]].  Why should they call themselves de facto 100 percent Nonprofit when they are similar to the Police paying salaries for doing the &lsquo;zig&rsquo; or the &lsquo;zag&rsquo;?</p>

That the money goes to the corporation&rsquo;s staff is irrelevant. This, incidentally, answers why corporations do all these tricks so they can pay lower salaries. Paying salaries cuts into their profits.</div>

<p>&lsquo;Corporate-ising&rsquo; a word or claiming special ownership of it does not change it from it&rsquo;s ordinary usage and meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Javascript, it is you who are quite mistaken about the ordinary usage and meaning of the term &ldquo;non-profit organization.&rdquo; As director of a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, The Jewish Institute for Youth and Family, I am well aware of what being a non-profit means. It is defined very clearly in the beginning of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization|Wikipedia article]]:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nonprofit organization (abbreviated as NPO, also known as a not-for-profit organization[1]) is an organization  that does not distribute its surplus funds to owners or shareholders, but instead uses them to help pursue its goals.[2]  Examples of NPOs include charities (i.e., charitable organizations), trade unions, trade associations and public arts organizations. Most governments and government agencies meet this definition, but in most countries they are considered a separate type of organization and not counted as NPOs. In most countries, NPOs are exempt from income and property taxation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ownership is the quantitative difference between for- and not-for-profit organizations. For-profit organizations can be privately owned and may re-distribute taxable wealth to employees and shareholders. By contrast, not-for-profit organizations do not have private owners. They have controlling members or boards, but these people cannot sell their shares to others or personally benefit in any taxable way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you see in the Wikipedia article, this definition basically holds around the world. Around the world non-profit does not mean non-income or non-salaried, but relates to the purposes of the organization, and restrictions on how the income may be used—the key thing being that it cannot issue stock and give dividends.</p>
<p>You are entitled to your views, but you don&rsquo;t control the meaning of words, which in this case are carefully defined legally, as well as in common practice.</p>
<p>I would also join the chorus in agreeing that requiring that non-profit organizations be also all-volunteer would kill most of them. And the existing very large non-profit sector in the US, in particular, has had the admiration of many countries.</p>
<p>And by the way, we at the Jewish Institute for Youth and Family gratefully receive your tax-free contributions and put them to good use helping children and families :)</p>

<p>On the opposite and at higher behaviours is the Nonprofit organisation.  The employees salaries and de facto salaries e.g. outsourced project payments are not compatible with the Nonprofit word. If specifically the scientific and technical qualification resources are not there in the Nonprofit organisation for mechanisation / automation  of a spiritual ceremony objective for an eternal guru, that I would say as being topmost important,  then outsourced project payments could be possible for ‘main’ mission if Nonsalary cannot be negotiated with  the outsourcing concerns.

<p>de facto Salaries meaning is ‘abstract’ -
(a)  it could internal e.g. another word rather than salaries is used.  Here Nonprofit should mean Nonsalary is certain.
(b)  it could be external / outsourced e.g. retainers or timely payments to third parties.   Ideally third / outsourced parties either (i) offering non-main service or (ii)  core objective/s of a Nonprofit service should not be requesting their de facto Salaries this way from a Nonprofit organisation and/or through sub-contractors based on the principle Nonprofit should mean Nonsalary.

<p>Opportunity cost of not fulfilling the meaning of the word ‘Nonprofit’ and similar words is less than the hiring salaried staff chosen opportunity, is not viable.</p>
<p>On April 13 2011, Google search engine put Richard Trevithick/Google logo theme to honour 240 years of his birth and credit his high pressure steam engine and first ever railway journey.  Richard Trevithick died at the Bull Inn in Dartford England almost as a martyr without his living close life/time ‘recognisers’.  Richard Trevithick called one of his designs, Puffing Devil, from a religious view an immoral name if you will.  This is what materialism is - the devil and Richard Trevithick conveyed it by calling one of his designs, Puffing Devil.  The material learning curve was and still is without spirituality and Richard Trevithick should be credited with his realisation.  It could be said it was a cry for help, what was he doing all this for?  Some people at that time might not have preferred Puffing Devil name and realisation and perhaps indirectly it contributed his  living close life/time ‘recognisers’ not being with him during his last days.  Has Google or it’s founders learnt from this?</p>
<p>Have those critics of Nonprofit should mean Nonsalary learnt this?</p>

He called a later engine &lsquo;Catch Me Who Can&rsquo;, so clearly had a penchant for whimsical names, or maybe you want to belabour an interpretation of that name to fit your purposes too?</p>
<p>Note also that Trevithick was British and that there is a very long tradition in Britain of naming things or places with reference to the devil or hell, in part to undermine their fearfulness with humour. So, for instance, some of my ancestors lived in a small hamlet in Wiltshire called Hell&rsquo;s Bottom. Various plants are referred to in this way, e.g. Devil&rsquo;s Apron, a kind of seaweed; Devil&rsquo;s Bite, a kind of helebore; Devil&rsquo;s Paintbrush, orange hawkweed; and of course Devil Tree, a species of dogbane. Devil&rsquo;s Darning Needle was a colloquial term for a dragonfly. And dragging this discussion painfully back to typography at last, the pot of molten metal into which used hot metal type was thrown to be melted down was called a Hellbox.</p>

<p>I have left the reader to choose about the previous posting.  Life&rsquo;s meanings are not always immediate as there could be a deeper level.  The Charity Commission in England has not a separate account&rsquo;s header for salaries in the registered charities account returns.  This is 2011 and a government organisation has not any regulation to show salaries mentioned on the registered charities account returns.  This alone suggests that something is wrong.  Tim Berners-Lee said, Internet Access Is A Human Right, [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/13/berners-lee-internet-access-human-right_n_848833.html]].  If the Internet does not integrate mechanisation / automation of Prabhupada Guru  spiritual ceremony then the Internet is only materialism, a puffing devil.  Should not Tim Berners-Lee or others say this also?  Why remain silent on this?  Then it is nepotism.</p>

<p>So there was a religious angle behind this all the time. I wonder if you are responsible for the Teen Pregnancy thread as well. Well, serves you right for writin' books like that Kama Sootra of yers! (*)</p>
<p>(*) A pretty desperate lurch back to Typophile&rsquo;s main &ndash; and only &ndash; interest. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;pretty desperate&rdquo; because, ho hum, let&rsquo;s be honest: we weren&rsquo;t reading that for the in-depth interviews, were we?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s call it quits: you don&rsquo;t respond on this thread and I won&rsquo;t respond to your postings, deal?  I guess our views are totally different.</p>
<p>BTW:  The caste system in India has brought problems because the person&rsquo;s occupation based on quality concept got manipulated by materialism to mean birthright rather than qualification.  What has happened in the West is &lsquo;Corporate Caste&rsquo; where ordinary meaning words get manipulated, for example rather than Nonprofit meaning Nonsalary it has been corporate-ised to include salaries.</p>

<p>Nice try though your bias is obvious.</p>
<p>The so-called model constitutions promoted by materialistic institutions for forming Charities in England are rewarded with easy registration at Charity Commission for England.  Even the Nonprofit organisation model constitutions auto-generated for internet instant formation in England could have salaries mentioned.  Thus if a ‘reformer’ says Nonprofit should mean Nonsalary, then these model constitutions mesh / motivate others into opposing this, either immediately or gradually by dulling them into accepting the so-called model constitutions.</p>

Is there a virtue in doing less good less effectively if this means relying exclusively on volunteer labour?</p>
<p>I am fully in favour of non-profit organisations being required by law to publicly disclose that they pay salaries and wages and how much they pay, but requiring them to rely on volunteer labour, because of a strict dualist separation of the spiritual and material &ndash; which is not, by the way, part of the religious heritage of the country you are discussing &ndash;, is neither necessary nor beneficial. I want non-profit organisations to demonstrate that they achieve the most good that they can in the most effective way possible, and if for some organisations that involves paying people so that they can devote themselves full time to the work of the organisation, that is to the greater good.</p>

You can continue your vendetta against non-profits as you wish but if you were truly person wanting to do good, you would use your energy volunteering your time to a positive endeavor rather than pointing out what you  may perceive to be the shortcomings of others.</div>

<p>If hypothetically internet  domain name suffix system for e.g. .com/.net/.org : the original ones, were a true indicator for the organisation’s stance towards profit or nonprofit.  The .com primarily would be for-profit.  The .org for the real Nonprofit or the Nonsalary-Nonprofit only.  The .net for the Semi-Nonprofit only or the so-called Nonprofit that prefers paying salaries to staff - borrowing some philosophy from .com and some from .org (see above).  Thus based on this hypothesis, actually .net is where most so-called Nonprofit organisations are at this time because they pay salaries.</p>
<p>There should not be any misrepresentation by the so-called Nonprofit organisations.  They should not have their internet domain names on the dot org suffix as they pay salaries.  They should not be on the dot net suffix even (see below health case) if they agree to being called Semi-Nonprofit organisations due to their paying salaries.  Thus to have the domain suffixes being a true indicator for an organisation’s stance towards profit or nonprofit would require effort from hypothesis only to reality.</p>
<p>If .com/.net/.org were to represent the human then it could be said that:</p>
<p>.com could represent the body
.net could represent the mind
.org could represent the soul</p>
<p>These days various health problems are do with mind (.net).  Thus even health has an impact by the personal and society views held.  In the above hypothesis the so-called Nonprofit organisation want to be represented by the  .net (as paying salaries to staff) is importing ideas from (1) the true Nonsalary-Nonprofit organisation represented by the  .org and  (2) the Forsalary-Forprofit business represented by the  .com.</p>
<p>Semi-Nonprofit organisation is thus a mixture (.net = .com + .org) and it uses this energy to do it’s things.  It is not a Nonsalary-Nonprofit organisation (.org) and it is not a Forsalary-Forprofit organisation (.com).</p>
<p>Is there really a need for Semi-Nonprofit organisations, whereby there could be a connection with health problems?  .net is a part of the human and it should be represented by transparent via media guru Prabhupada channels, the Tele (from .com) and Vision (from .org) thus Television or (i.e. .net is TV in a symbolic way) and this will reduce mind health problems.  Clean the ‘.net’ (see above)  and you bring purity.</p>

<p>I think when a NPO gets massive to the point it&rsquo;s impossible for it to remain a part time job, then I believe that wages should be paid to the people who run the show that they can pay their bills.  In response to Baker&rsquo;s salary, I think that is a little absurd&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fallingwhistles.com">www.fallingwhistles.com</a> is a good example of a NPO that isn&rsquo;t corrupt, the people who do run this company as a full time job, take a modest $500 a month to survive on, which is $6000 a year..  In this case I think that is reasonable.</p>

<p>Baker&rsquo;s salary needs to be considered in comparison to the typical salaries for a CEO in the same industry sector. This again demonstrates the essential distinction between the business model of an organisation and the wages of the people who work within and for that organisation. People are paid wages commensurate with the work that they do, not on the basis of whether the organisation is for-profit or non-profit. So, how does Baker&rsquo;s salary &ndash; bearing in mind also that it relates to work that she does for Mozilla in a number of different capacities &ndash; compare with that of people doing the same job in for-profit organisations in the same industry sector? Last week, Google filed SEC papers reporting that Eric Schmidt, Google&rsquo;s executive chairman would receive an annual salary of $1,250,000; this to a man whose stock holdings are already worth $7,000,000,000.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Success in Alternative Meaning&rdquo; (SAM) should not be the focus.  Even if a &lsquo;successful&rsquo; so-called Nonprofit organisation is paying salaries, it is misrepresenting the meaning of the Nonprofit word.  Nonprofit should mean Nonsalary. The materialist governments are cheating by having laws that allow salaries to be paid by so-called Nonprofit organisations.  This is corruption and it deviates the common usage meaning and also character changes people.</p>

<p>@javascript
By your definition, all NPO companies, some which have millions of dollars being donated to them, should be ran by volunteers?  If this is the case, that company would be horribly inefficient for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You would have to work around the volunteers schedule, so if they have other jobs, they might only be able to volunteer for a few hours every week.  And from personal experiences with working for NPO&rsquo;s, there is a massive amount of organization and coordination that requires countless hours to manage.</li>
<li>You would need people who have a working knowledge in financing/administration to run the show.  This isn&rsquo;t the type of thing an average Joe can do right off the bat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Frankly, a large NPO should be ran by a few administrators (that earn just enough to pay the bills) that make sure everything runs smoothly, as well as an army of volunteers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Successfully Altering Meaning&rdquo; (SAM) by materialist governments and so-called Nonprofit organisations who pay salaries is a devious implementation to circumvent the principle that Nonprofit should mean Nonsalary.  This principle is commonsense.  I am finding it surprising if especially educated people question this principle.  Perhaps some material education has made some materially educated people  more ‘bold’ (sic)  to reject certain principles.  Why should the commonsense Nonprofit=Nonsalary principle be twisted and compromised to fit the so-called Nonprofit organisations who are interested in paying salaries? These so-called Nonprofit organisations need to obey the principle, not the principle having to be altered to fit their requirements.  The principle requires a movement, it is not everything as before with salaries being paid.  It requires a serious effort to change the so-called Nonprofit organisation into a real Nonprofit organisation.  Being  in the real Nonprofit organisation and not receiving salaries might not suit those who were in the so-called Nonprofit organisation receiving salaries previously, especially if they have other character traits.  The Nonprofit=Nonsalary principle has implications for the centralised run so-called Nonprofit organisations that are paying salaries.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The principle, as you call it, is neither common sense nor generally accepted. It is an principle that you insist on contrary to all demonstrations that profits and salaries are different things, that income and expenses are different things, that organisational structures and organisational goals are different things. Profit is a particular class of revenue, surplus to the operating expenses of the organisation, that may be disbursed outside of an organisation. That&rsquo;s what profit is, and you are the one who is trying to alter the meaning of words to suggest that profits and salaries are somehow the same thing. They&rsquo;re not, and you won&rsquo;t find a single economist who agrees with you. You may relish disagreeing with all economists, I suppose, and consider them tools of materialist governments &ndash; is there any other kind? &ndash;, but the fact is that we are talking about economics.</p>
<p>You mention corruption. Corruption has many forms, but central to it is the abuse of power for personal enrichment. So, is it abuse of power for someone to receive a reasonable wage for work that they do? Is it? I don&rsquo;t doubt that corruption exists in the non-profit sector, but then it also exists in the for-profit sector. From this we can conclude that corruption, like salaries and wages, is something distinct from the organisational goal and operating model of organisations. There are many, many charitable organisations that pay reasonable and in no way excessive salaries and wages to officers and workers, in order to enable the effective and efficient operation of those organisations to do the most good that they are able to do. That is not corruption.</p>

<p>Before this corporate development when there were individuals only in trade and cash only without credit flexibility to cover any debts/losses, prepayments, big purchases etc, the individuals could only afford ‘salary’ after they were able to profit from their activities and this ‘salary’ might not have been consistent and fixed.  It depended on ‘real time’.  This is the case even with some  start ups now.</p>
<p>With corporate development, big ambitions, mass industrialisation, deals, bourse, hot money, international trade, globalisation, accounting/financial instruments, intense research in exploitation resources,  monopolisation, periodical billing and what not, has the salaries concept  switched from ‘real time’ to ‘chartered accounting time’ with ‘chartered accounting salaries’ becoming fixed and it being deducted before ‘chartered accounting profit.’</p>
<p>The so-called Nonprofit organisations paying salaries have based their foundations on ‘chartered accounting time’, ‘chartered accounting   salaries’ and ‘chartered accounting profit’ not the original ‘real time’.  Thus so-called Nonprofit paying salaries are not as a result of the ‘real time’ and thus are benefiting from hard materialism and also protecting hard materialism.</p>
<p>This results in so-called Nonprofit organisations who pay salaries doing things ‘after the (bad) events’ not much ’before the (bad) events’.  There is so much proof regarding this.  The individual has a free choice in this society to use their human resources whether in a Nonprofit or in a Forprofit or both.  There is not any physical force, it is illegal  and thus this argument from you about slavery is baseless.  It depends on an individual where to put their efforts and time.  Actually the slavery nowadays in this context is this ‘chartered accounting time’, ‘chartered accounting   salaries’ and ‘chartered accounting profit’ which means the real Nonprofit word meaning is ignored with “Successfully Altering Meaning” (SAM) implementation.</p>
<p>Let us not wait till it is too late and understand the Nonprofit word from a ‘real time’ view or it’s original commonsense meaning and in this way we may perhaps reach some understanding that Nonprofit word should mean Nonsalary.</p>
