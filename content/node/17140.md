    the problem when there's a significant difference of age between partners -- I
    was 28, but Sabine was only 21 when we had our first daughter. And then of course
    we thought we'd stop at two but decided to have a third one 6 years after our
    son. :^)\r\n\r\n<em>> Oooh. Can\u2019t resist a limerick.</em>\r\n\r\nDamn straight:\r\n\r\n<em>There
    once was a drummer from Belgium\r\nWho had way too much type in his cranium.\r\nWhenever
    that nutter saw fonts\r\nHe simply <strong>had</strong> to I.D. 'em.\r\n\r\nJust
    when he thought he'd go senile\r\nHe found this site called Typophile.\r\nEveryone
    talked the same language.\r\nHe knew resistance was futile.</em>\r\n\r\nThird
    verse to come -- limericks in English are hard for me. ;^)"
