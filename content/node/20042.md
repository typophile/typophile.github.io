  few years, and a lovely jovial fellow to boot.\r\n\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\r\n\r\n<strong>Los

  body: So? How was it? Was the conversation stimulating? Were ligatures discussed
    and appreciated all around? Did everyone behave? Do tell, do tell.

  body: "ahhh, well, dinally I m back. SF days were very nice. Beautiful city.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the dinner, I m very happy to meet some type folks there. They were very friendly
    and they choose a really nice (neo-mexican?) restaurant. The guacamole was terrific.
    \r\n\r\nAbout the ligatures I showed them some projects and it was nice to see
    what they liked more so I ll work with more energy on that. The guys there received
    a few nice newspapers published during the Letras Latinas exhibition featuring
    the 70 works selected. So, if you were outisde SF that day, then you missed that
    :P\r\n\r\nAnd they were trying to convince me to go to Typecon, hmmm...who knows"
