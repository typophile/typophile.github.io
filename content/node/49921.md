  similar to the awesome Newzald font (http://vllg.com/KLIM/Newzald/mudTyper+Weights/)?
  I'm specifically looking for the bold italic or black italic version.\r\n\r\n"

  body: You won't find many free text fonts that are anywhere near Newzald's quality.
    Best bet would be to go with one of the fonts that comes with Adobe CS like Warnock
    or Minion.
