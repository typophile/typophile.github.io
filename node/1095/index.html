<div class=commentbody>well so far I'm liking #1, purely for aesthetic reasons. its toothpasty, yum. <br> <br>however, I hope the blue and pink isin't meant for boys and girls - cause that's going a bit too cute. the design could be cleaned up some - the detail of it shows alot of areas where line work could be touched up - as well as perhaps spelling it correctly. <br> <br>personally though I'm looking forward to seeing the more witty ones that have some kind of original concept to them. (nudge nudge, and not the "rip off concepts" we argued about last time)</div>

<div class=commentbody>i just want to ask what the purpose of linking each design to a country is...

<div class=commentbody>I think discussing the tees in a separate thread is <br>not very practical.

<div class=commentbody><b>1</b> For what it's worth, I think we should dump the country bit <br>too. Sounds like there's a concensus on that.

So even though the design can't go all the way to the seem, if you take the max print area it will be halfway to someone's armpit! <br> <br>You're welcome to post an great shirt that flies in the face of what I just said! <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>i don't think i posted this, maybe i did. <br> <br>not to be rude but these submissions are not that engaging. Most of them don't speak about type, let alone convey the essence of typophile. We've got guns and knifes which definately do not speak about typography. <br> <br>no, i haven't submitted my design yet, but i just thought i'd voice my opinion. it's just frustrating to see so many lackluster submissions. i figured this year would be more intense than last year. however, not all designs have been submitted yet and i realize that. just wanted to rant a little bit. <br> <br>t1mmy <br> <br></div>

I'm not gonna get nasty on them, at least they are submitting theses things... perhaps they are really spending some time on them so whatever...they have until the 30th if that's what they want to do. its not my deal - simply commenting on what perhaps is going on with regard to the quality and quantity so far. <br> <br>if you wanted for the public to view them all ahead of time for the sake of collaboration and have a revision period - then push back your judging date and mention there's a 2 week period where ALL submissions are up for review, critique and revision. <br> <br>issue solved. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Tanya, I'm just trying to encourage great entries early as it <br>will hopefully raise the bar for everybody else. I'm <br>sufficiently chilled though... Nobody's going to complain if <br>we get a huge pile of entries on the last day - we'd be ecstatic. <br> <br>Re: the revision period. People who revise their entries are <br>welcome to do it during the 30 day window.

<div class=commentbody>Except the "popular winner" last time had the "california job case" text removed... Kind of bummed me out, since I thought it was a great joke about the economy. I mean, subtlety is good if it amplifies the value of what's not said, but not for just its own sake. In that case for example, leaving the text in wouldn't have made it "valuably" less subtle (because anybody who's heard what a California job case is also knows what a type case <i>looks</i> like), and it would have preserved the joke. Without that text, the shirt was just cool, instead of being cool <i>and</i> funny. To be fair though, the shirt was still good without the text. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>But Yves seems to be talking about size "mistakes" due to lack of familiarity with designing for a t-shirt, something you can't really learn without doing once - but we don't need to require such particular expertise. <br> <br>The rules say that a winning shirt might be modified, and I think somebody who realizes his experience with designing for a t-shirt is lacking would probably take the advice. <br> <br>Yes, if a shirt is totally covered with graphics for example, that's bad news. But something like a 75% resize for a "stand-alone" image should be seen as an open possibility. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Exactly what I meant, Hrant. I'm not talking about wall-to-wall <br>graphics here, just about "a tad too close to the armpits" <br>mistakes. I agree with you Christopher.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd like to see more concepts that are <a href=http://www.typophile.com target=_blank>www.typophile.com</a> - centric. I don't mean style, or that it should say dot com. More, that I want a shirt that has a concept firmly planted on what goes on here at typophile. What makes it unique? Why do people post here? Why do people lurk here? <br> <br>Type in general is fine. Typophililia is fine. Letterpress is fine. Letraset is fine. Fleurons are fine. Give me typophile. This funky place we visit. And give it with a little attention to typography? Please. <br> <br>Cheers, <br>Randy <br> <br>BTW, there are a few out there doing this already. More. More. More. Oh, and keep it out of the armpits :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>If a shirt is totally covered with graphics that shirt should be sent back to the designer with a mentiont that they didn't follow rules of printability before it gets displayed. <br> <br>the template does clearly show the "printable area" If they are sizing it to fill that you cannot make any judgement to say the design is too big...it may be their intent. <br> <br>And if it is their intent - and they are following the critiques offered by the public and take the chance to revise - then that's it. <br> <br>Just as it would be for say a colour change, or spelling mistake. <br> <br>The judges selections can't incorporate the idea to change up the organization, location and size of elements - that's mukking with the actual design. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Typo Tee Two ends when the happy servers who deliver my email timestamp incoming entries as October 1. So you have the full day of Sept 30 to get your entry in. <br> <br>Revisions: You can revise any design and resubmit it before the deadline. Please reference your design by # so that we replace the proper image/entry. <br> <br>Once your design is chosen, there may be additional time for you to refine your design in preparation for printing. We, together with the judges, look at feedback posted during the competition to suggest where the designer might revise his/her design. <br> <br>Judge voting will begin Monday, October 6th and will close Monday, Oct 13. We'll notify the winner immediately and announce the winner publicly on October 15th. <br> <br>We'll also post a public vote which will run concurrently Oct 6-13, which will include a selection of shirts that get the best public reviews in the forums. We would love to have two shirts to choose from in 2004; however, this will ultimately be decided by our financial situation and the public's voting response. So vote! <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Stephen, I agree. I made a similar observation in another thread: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/18725.gif alt=graph> <br> <br>If I had the time (or inclination) to overlay a graph of last year's contest I think the difference would be clear, though perhaps not dramatic. <br> <br>I love the "I like type" message for it's directness and simplicity -- that's it's strength. I also think it is a courageous choice on the part of the judges, by which I mean it is almost "underdesigned" (in a very good way). To be honest, though, I'm not sure how likely I am to wear it. The color and scale are just not "me" but I'll wait till I see the final. <br> <br>Of course, I'm just one guy. There are 1,931 registered Typophiles. <br> <br>"Registered Typophiles," that sounds creepy...</div>

<div class=commentbody>I enjoy the irony, and I also look forward to wearing this shirt. <br> <br>You've reminded me of the Alanis Morissette song "Isn't it Ironic". An entire song dedicated to irony that contains no irony at all. <br> <br>;D</div>

<div class=commentbody>Despite the <i>drop in quality</i> this year, there seem to be no shortage of opinions about which shirt should have been picked. I picked none of the ones on the judges list (well, maybe one). I think the only solution is to print the top 20 and give every entrant crazy abounts of swag. Now all we need is a really rich benefactor... see, the old guys had it right. </div>

<div class=commentbody>To address Ms Sprowl's comments, (and in so doing, a lot of others',) let me say that my fellow judges and I liked the concept of the "I like type." T-shirt more than the actual design. We would rather see it in another classic typeface - my choice would be A.G. Old Face - with nice tight word spacing and perhaps a little smaller on the shirt, (as though it was slightly shameful to be walking around announcing - hell, advertising - one's predilection.) <br> <br>Also, I'm not sure that I'd wear another silk-screened red t-shirt. (I already have a Dolly shirt, which is plenty.) <br> <br>Personally, I find the concept and content of the shirt to be the most Typophile-ic. Other designs may be said to be more beautiful. Some Ts looked as though they had been plucked from the Priced To Sell rack at Urban Outfitters, their only tie to Typophile being the word "Typophile" added somewhere. To me personally, those U.O. shirts weren't even worth considering for the contest, as much as I may have liked them visually. <br> <br>If there is anything anyone would like to know, I'd be happy to post further. <br> <br>With best regards, <br>c</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stephen - All I was trying to express was that its a surprise. Its not to do with picking out others that I might like more. Something so simple, soooooo simple, like ultra-super-duper simple. Its a smack upside the head. Now that its won, it would almost be awkward to hold another contest. <br> <br>I agree with Christopher's comments about it, and nodded while reading Chester's. (would never have thought that the winning tee would highlight Helvetica) - Its great to hear the ideas behind the decision, and I'm not knocking the choice at all. <br> <br>Personally I have my own little hate thing going on with helvetica, I'll get over it in a year or two, I'll buy a shirt regardless, I could wear it, but have to save face, stand by and definately not wear it to work - sucks to be me for now. <br> <br>could we get it in B/W purdy please?</div>
