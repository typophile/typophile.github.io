  a wide letter stacked on top of each other. (see small image below)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cc_4393.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  interested in specifically this style as well as general type work from this era,
  if you guys know of anything off the top of your head that is related, I'd really
  like to see it! or a link to a previous thread, specific style names, etc..\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    but I have a feeling [[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL6346630M/How_to_design_monograms_symbols|this
    book]] would be exactly what you need. There's a spread from the book reproduced
    at [[http://ruffledblog.com/2009/05/how-to-design-vintage-monograms/|this blog]].

    creation of a few big groups, it was a style pretty common for bank logos (presumably

    \ Edited to wide and narrow, thank you! Those are some great links (though the

    \r\n\r\nThe mark above with the 'wide and narrow' combination is better described

    the time period you were aiming at.

    nice if you happen to live in a rural area without reasonable access to any sort
    of nice library (I don't anymore, but used to). \r\n\r\nThe \"read online\" versions
    tend to be zoomable to much higher resolutions than the .pdf versions, by the
    way, but they're annoying to read unless you have pretty decent and consistent
    bandwidth.\r\n\r\nI don't remember what that broken link was supposed to go to,
    but I'm sure it's amongst those listed in the second link anyway."
