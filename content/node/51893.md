    vertical terminals create tiny counters that don\u2019t hold up in dark places
    and the tight letterspacing makes things even worse. There\u2019s a reason nobody
    uses it for road signs!"

  body: "I don't think one should apply the same criteria to pedestrian signage as
    to vehicular.\r\n\r\nBut one thing I have always wondered is why the names of
    train/subway stations aren't in super-extended faces, so that you can read them
    as your train pulls into the station (or whizzes thru) at speed. Is there anywhere
    in the world where that's been done?\r\n\r\n(Ooops, bit off topic. Sorry Paul.)"

    dark I mean.  Madrid uses Helvetica and I've never found it to be a problem except
    in the few cases where the printers accidentally used Arial, but it tends to be
    well-lit, extremely well-lit in the new stations. In fact, with the new designs
    for the stations, Helvetica looks extremely sharp.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es
