body: I don't have any experience with graffiti. I googled some photos, and used some
  elements from a few to create a logo for my brother in-law. He lives in Phoenix,
  so there are quite a few graffiti artists in the area. He sells car audio equipment
  and accessories(rims, graphics, etc.) so his clients will know graffiti. Is there
  anything wrong with this logo, are there rules to graffiti?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pounded_4079.gif]

    with a few comments;  First off, I'm not a grafitti artist either, but from what
    I have seen the letters you've used are a little too legible compared to proper
    'NYC Subway grafitti' text.  You definitely seem to be going in the right direction,
    but you've got to take a bit more of a chance with the design I'd say.  To be
    honest, there are some great grafitti type fonts out there that you may be better
    off using as a starting point, then adapting it as you go along.\r\nAlso, in case
    you haven't done so already, just google for some ideas on grafitti.  It always
    helps to see what is missing that's not immediately obvious, even when you know
    it's not quite right.\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "I created the type, based on some googled images. I've tried to find a balance
    of something edgy but readable. Does it have to be legible? as it is a logo for
    a new company. I'm trying to balance between people who \"are\" and \"know\" with
    people who \"want\" and \"try\" to be. I don't want to turn any of his clients
    off/away.\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply.\r\n\r\nDC"

  body: "First off, I'm not quite sure if it says \"rounded\" or \"pounded\".\r\n\r\nThe
    big graffiti you're trying to emulate here usually has an area-filling sort of
    uncial quality that would seldom even start to resemble a proper lowercase. Ascenders
    and descenders, when they exist, would bend into an arrow or something that fills
    the space created over and under the other letters.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, graffiti
    style is extremely gestural. It is born of waving a spray can around unguided.
    The \"by 3sixty\" part looks authentic, but the main mark is simply too rigid.
    Even the angular styles are a lot looser; wherever you have a perfectly vertical
    line, try to think of ways it could deliberately slouch one way or another."

  body: "Let me start by saying: There <cite>ARE</cite> rules to write by. For more
    on this watch \"INFAMY\" a good graff doc.\r\n\r\nLex is right, I myself am a
    graff artist turned designer and there is nothing we [writers] hate more than
    someone trying to hi-jack our culture. Furthermore, most of the writers you find
    out there will say \"it belongs in the streets not in a magazine.\" But it's inevitable,
    plus graphic design will save us all after we get arrested too many times.\r\n\r\nSo
    with that being said, Your letters look ok but you're kind of straddling two tradional
    handstyles which is why it probly doesn't <cite>FEEL</cite> authentic . Contrary
    to what <cite>Cerulean</cite> has to say it doesn't have to be super flowy and
    smooth, some of the illest styles are just simple block letters; rigid as hell!\r\n
    \r\nRight now your caught between fat block and butter letters. It either needs
    to be more squared-off or be more fluid; your choice. I'd also say that you need
    to add some 3d perspective (see above photo), nothing too complex but it will
    go a long way toward making it look authentic and more polished. If you use indesign
    put on a drop shadow (color of your choice) make the shadow size pretty large
    and then crank the spread and opacity all the way up then mess with the angle.
    Without a 3d drop its just a burner! Thats how it gets down. Even if your demo
    is not strictly Graff writers you should try and do our culture justice, otherwise
    you're client will get no respect from the people they are trying to emulate.
    Keep it right not wrong.  \r\n\r\nP.S. excuse the essay but this is my wheelhouse

  body: "Lex is right. \r\n\r\nMake  your target audience wish they got the commission,
    or wonder who the artist is, instead of calling you out as a faker.\r\n\r\nConsider
    creating a reference to grafitti that is not a logo. Consider painting the entire
    facade of the building in graffiti, but having a logotype that contrasts it, and
    is readable.\r\n\r\nThe best example is Ape Do Good, a printer in SF. No I'm not
    saying this is graffiti, but it has the same street-cred without the clich\xE9.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "I also agree with Lee, Lex & Joe about hiring a real graf artist to do the
    logo. You either can or you can't. There's no faking it. \r\n\r\nHowever - if
    you are going to do the logo yourself, I absolutely agree with Joe, that you have
    to reference graffiti in a way that doesn't try to simply copy it. If you look
    beyond graffiti style, it can be looked at as a certain approach to typography.
    A more honest approach. Have your brother-in-law just write his company name in
    his own handwriting. \r\n\r\nIf you simply must have the graffiti style look,
    the one thing your logo is missing is connectivity. There's no continuation or
    flow between letters or any of it, really. None of the letters relate to each
    other, visually. Until you get that part of it right - it'll never look real. "

  body: "This post is super late but just in case you still haven't sorted this out...\r\n\r\nYou
    could also throw an ad up on craigslist for just the sketch. You'd be surprised
    how many writers are trying to start getting paid for it even if it's next to
    nothing. This could get you half or more of the way there.\r\n\r\nAs far as doing
    it yourself, i agree with gfs and lee. My only suggestion would be to simplify
    it first. The foundation is the hand style which is simply writing the word. If
    you don't have any hand style then it doesn't matter how many bells and whistles
    (arrows, 3D etc.) you lace on top to try and make it \"graffiti\", it still wont
    hold up. \r\n\r\nForget color, arrows, 3d and just practise tagging the word,
    this is where the flow and overall composition will come. Once your happy with
    that, then start adding some weight to the letters and turn it into a throw up
    and then a burner if need be.  If your dealing with a logo that has to be easily
    read, i would definitely keep it on the simple side.  \r\nTry image googling \"Graffiti
    hand style, Graffiti throw ups and Graffiti burners\"\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n"

    just wanted to add a few words to the subject.\r\nIt's not about sketching it's
    about writing.\r\nThe tag or Hand style is important as it helps to work on the
    letter structure.\r\nAlso it's important to work on the empty spaces in between
    the letters.\r\n\r\nFor more info please check the graffiti workshop tutorial
