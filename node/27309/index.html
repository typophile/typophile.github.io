After all, other types made ubiquitous by [[bundling]], such as [[Comic Sans]], [[Papyrus]], [[Trajan]] and [[Arialvetica]] have been roundly dissed for overexposure.
Only trouble is, it could prove difficult to find an alternative with suitable, er, impact, especially considering Impact's barely-protruding [[descender|descenders]].

Not at all. Geoffrey Lee, the designer himself, <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/7921">joined a Typophile discussion</a> a couple of years ago to talk about its origins. I gained some more respect for the face and was reminded that its over- and misuse is mostly due to bundling.</div>

On the subject of Impact, I got pretty sick of it years ago. It does serve its purpose well but if I need to use a face like that I normally select a weight of Compacta or one of the compressed weights of Helvetica instead.</div>

Here, here, I agree. Impact is like so totally lame.

What's needed is an easy scapegoat to blame for all the crap typography in the world. We should form a lynch mob and pay <strong> www.ascendercorp.com </strong> a visit.

Its gotta be a step in the right diretion. Well, it'll make me feel better anyway.

Bundling fonts with software is to be expected, and Windows et al have an adequate range for most peoples needs. 

I think Impact is an OK font, just not my choice for anything. So is Comic Sans come to that, as long as it's used in the right context, ie a cartoon speech bubble and not a business letter or funeral service.

Arial is only commonplace because someone didn't want to pay for the rights to Helvetica and the unrefined masses can't tell the difference anyway.

But hey, we shouldn't get snobby, it's the price to be paid for typographic liberation.

		<div class="commentbody">Cool, Chris. I'll check out that thread.

On font bundling, sure the mere availability of computer-based fonts allows for misuse. But that's true for every creative application ever sold for a computer -at least one that was priced at any somewhat affordable level. What do we do about it? Price fonts and any application that can handle them well out of reach of most people?

I'll offer what I think is the root of the problem: our education system.

There were penmanship courses in the past. Sometimes the garden variety art course in high school would delve into calligraphy. High schools have taught typing. But what are they doing that is appropriate for today? I think schools need to offer some basic page layout courses that include some basic coverage of typography.

Just from the simple standpoint of putting together a résumé regular people aren't given much of a clue on what is appropriate for business communication. They are left on their own to guess.

Even if operating systems and office productivity suites had their font bundles removed, we would still see lots of bad type happening.

A lady I know who makes banners and other "fast sign" stuff in my town has really horrid taste in type. But she has fun doing what she's doing and other people are stupid enough to pay her for it. The awful nature of her work comes from a lack of design sense (or talent for that matter) in knowing what kind of fonts can work well with each other. She downloads lots of freeware fonts at various free font sites and comes up with some really strange combinations.

I think most people know good typography when they see it. They know the page looks better, but don't know how to break down the mechanics on why the page looks better.

In the end good designers have to look at the situation as being more of an opportunity rather than a problem, work harder and use the imbalance to get more work for themselves. The most loyal customers tend to be the ones who are educated enough to understand the difference.</div>

Those last few look OK until you see how big on the body Impact is, and how truly stunted its extenders are. I don't have any of those three on hand, but here's Impact vs. Helvetica Black Condensed at the same point size, to illustrate the two features I mentioned.

		<div class="commentbody">> should bundled fonts come in the four basic styles?

Many people here will say fonts should not be bundled.

I like it when fonts come in all four weights. The most overly used bundled font is probably Zapf Chancery, which most people think is a script, since it was bundled without the romans and the italics in other weights. It's a fine font, if you can avoid overuse of the italic weight everyone is so familiar with.

But I got one of the Shelley fonts bundled in an Adobe product once. There just isn't a roman version, and it would be silly to think of one. 

Display fonts, traditionally, come solely or in incomplete families.</div>

Right, not a very useful idea--but that kind of thing has been done.
The roman of Frank Heine's Dalliance was reverse-engineered from an italic script.</div>

<strong>Nick Shinn</strong> said:

I wonder why Block Berthold wasn't mentioned. Also, I'm very enamored of [[http://www.typonine.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=147&Itemid=79|TeslaDynamo]] at the moment. Don't have it yet, alas, but hope to soon.
