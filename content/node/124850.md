  body: "Today the _E_ that looks like a _C_ with a crossbar reminds us of the Euro
    sign, but in the 1940s there were a few fonts with this feature, such as Lucian
    Bernhard\u2019s Fashion and Gothic, which had it as an alternate character. It
    is revived in a font by Nick Curtis, Samosata NF http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/samosata-nf/\r\nDon"

    but with better samples. \r\nIt feels very mashed up to me, mixing bauhaus style,
    unicase treatment and a geometric (grotesk) sans.\r\nAs digital alternative I
    like: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/victory/bayer-sans|Bayer Sans]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/aldrans|Aldrans]],

    useful resource, Mike Bowfin's [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html|'Bauhaus-Style'

    of the comments on the WTF forum said there were \"... serifs on the \u201CM\u201D

    is short extenders. I see no serifs on this lettering, which looks almost monoline
    to me.\r\nDon\r\n"
