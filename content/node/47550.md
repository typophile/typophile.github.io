  body: "I really can't think of a script with this sort of contrast. It's not calligraphic,
    especially the 'n', although it seems to give that impression. It looks like Art
    Deco style. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/bernhard-brushscript-sg/|Bernhard
    Brush Script]] is from that era (1928), and has the looping l, but not the thin
    right-side strokes. The M is quite distinctive, and odd. It reminds me of the
    Miller Beer logo, which was the inspiration for [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/draft-beer-classic/|Draft
    Beer]] from Font Mesa. Certainly not the same, except in a structural way.\r\n\r\nI
    thought it might also be worth a look at the [[http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=Bluemlein&producttype=TYP&pricemodel=RM%2cRF|Bluemlein
    collection]] of scripts revived by Alejandro Paul, since they too are (roughly)
    from this era of design, but I didn't see anything particularly similar, since
    they are really taken from handwriting samples.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: When it comes to identifying script(-like) faces, Mike Yanega rules this board.
    And don't worry about the size of that image; it's just that it's impossible to
    see the whole picture -- literally! :^D

    failed miserably - fact is it is a pretty odd looking typeface. Anyway, your suggestions
    have been very helpful.\r\nCheers,\r\nSian"

  body: I'm guessing it was done with a couple of different widths of pen. A broad
    flat nib for the thicker strokes & a thinner, round nib for the finer ones. Also
    it was quite likely lots of different versions of each letter were worked out
    on different sheets & the best ones collaged together for this final layout.
