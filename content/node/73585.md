body: The font I'm looking for is the one that is usually on those old red and yellow
  propaganda posters that say things like "Rise up!" and have pictures at fists and
  hammers at the bottom. I feel like maybe they were old Soviet posters but I can't
  get a picture of one so I hope someone can help.
