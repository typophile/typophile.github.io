  she design any typefaces? \r\nIf she did, what is it called? And where can I find/buy/find
  something similar to it?\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance! :)"

      Adobe video that features her... \r\nshe mentioned about her typography learning
      days and about how she used to paint her own type onto acetate for the album
      covers.. but that's about it, really."

    older pre-computer designers worked this way.  Very few took the lettering of
    a single job further and started to design typefaces (see Lubalin).  The process
    was longer and more involved then. I have just recently begun typeface design
    after 40 years of just graphic design.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
