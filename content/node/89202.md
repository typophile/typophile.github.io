  recently dead computer, and of course I don't remember it's name.\r\n\r\nI have
  only few letters but the lower case 'k' is really special. here is also upper case
  O A and C to help.\r\nsorry for the low quality.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/1883/koac.jpg\"></img>\r\n\r\nthanks
  to you, and have a good day !;)"
