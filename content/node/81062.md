  decided to start working towards actually completing a font. These are two projects
  I'm working on right now. They are both unicase (I really like unicase fonts) -
  other than that, I think they pretty much speak for themselves. The first one may
  be a bit ambitious, but hey, let me know what you think! Even if you think it isn't
  very good. I just want some perspective.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BEAST-01-01_6411.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CANDY-01_6106.png]"

    more?\r\n:)\r\n\r\nthe first one looks kind of strange, i suppose those \"outgrowts\"
    should be some kind of \"ink traps\"?\r\ni doubt that will look good in small
    sizes. maybe some optimazing would do it."

  body: "Interesting you're working on two so much contrasting fonts. Well both are
    rather bold.\r\n\r\nVery nice. The black letter based unicase looks very very
    nice display font. /S/ is unbalanced thought. And lots is still missing. But is
    a great start. The way you've designed /a/ is rather unique and beautiful.\r\n\r\nCandy
    on the other hand is not so unique. Don't get me wrong. It's just as well nice,
    but not as special as the unicase Beast."

  body: "I must say I really like them both, but I love Beast. I'm super interested
    to see it finished. The little \"outgrowths,\" as you're calling them, are great.
    Adds a lot of flavor to the face. The /a/ in particular is a beautiful little
    nugget. \r\nCandy is also really nice. It seems to flow well, but of course I'd
    have to see a lot more of it to gauge that accurately. I've always been a fan
    of the heavier style of font, and these are right up my alley. Really nice work."

  body: "Here are some sketches of the first one. It's still in very early stages,
    and I am just sort of having fun with it. and those \"outgrowths\" you are talking
    about are really more like serifs - it's really experimental and it's sort my
    attempt to bring together the humanist aspects of blackletter and oldstyle.\r\n\r\n(image
