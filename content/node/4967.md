  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d buy Ambient &#40;it&#39;s pretty cool&#41;, but I only need to
  use it once.  Same for Mirage.'

    to use them for another project. If you want free, I suggest hand lettering.

  body: Meh.  I will buy Ambient. <BR> <BR>I won&#39;t do that for Mirage, though.
    <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t believe there aren&#39;t any free similar fonts.

  body: There&#39;s a free rip-off of Mirage, but pointing you to it  <BR>would be
    in contradiction with current policy on Typophile. <BR>We don&#39;t mind free
    fonts, but we do mind when they&#39;re  <BR>stolen designs. Sorry, you&#39;ll
    have to look a bit harder.
