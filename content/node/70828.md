  through Google, but I didn't find this (well, not immediately, anyway\u2026). I
  did find out that they like using proprietary typefaces (other than Times and Minion,
  from what I found). Is [[http://www.edkashi.com/blog/uploaded_images/Christ_NatGeo_0609_cover-779339.jpg|this]]
  another case of a proprietary typeface at use? Here's [[http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/palemale-store/natgeodec2008cover|another
  sample]] and [[http://www.mandmglobal.com/cmsimages/Company-Profiles/National_Geographic_Cover_1.jpg|yet
  another one]].\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NATGEO_3629.png]\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!"

    should sell their fonts through MyFonts or FontShop too. Or at least put samples
    up on Identifont\u2026 :P I guess it's all in the name of business.\r\nMaybe I
    should just memorize all their typefaces to cover that. :P\r\n\r\nThank you kindly,
