  body: 'Well, I wouldn&#39;t say it looks so legible. <BR>There is a lot of odd stuff,
    for instance: <BR> <BR>-t is too high, and its crossbar too; <BR>-it&#39;s too
    tight for this size. try 2 pixels spacing, &#34;stem-to-stem&#34;; <BR>-vwyz are
    wide &#40;or are the other letters too narrow?&#41;; <BR>-VW are really wide;
    <BR>-bdpq looks strange: the bowls should be similar to o; <BR>-x is narrow; <BR>-A&#39;s
    counter is too closed; <BR>-the numbers seems to differ in style from other characters...
    <BR> <BR>I think you still have a lot of work to do here. <BR>Good luck.'

  body: Made some changes &#40;thanx Eduardo&#41; and think that is better now. Maybe
    need to make &#39;h&#39; 1 pixel narrow. <BR> <BR>Here is the new version with
    some kerning work too. Thanks. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11123.gif"

  body: Well maybe the face looks more regular now, but too standarized. The first
    example was more inviting for the reader, and i think that the &#34;strange&#34;
    shapes helped on ditinguishing the word shapes, wich is not so easy in pixel grid.
