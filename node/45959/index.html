  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I was wondering about Emigre&rsquo;s types. A few years ago they were top of the hype, so much overused that they are now paying the price of success; I can&rsquo;t go through Emigre&rsquo;s catalog without seeing &ldquo;1990&rdquo; written everywhere. I mean, apart from a few types (Malaga, Vista, Mrs Eaves, Tribute), who can actually still use today types such as Triplex, Matrix Script, Keedy, Dogma, Democratica, Dead History or Citizen?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some of their faces look dated, but they don&rsquo;t even have all the ones they originally started with (i think one was Berkley). They&rsquo;re constantly reinventing their typefaces (Matrix II) because I think they realize this. Licko, Keedy, etc. were some of the first good type designers on the digital platform, and thusly did a lot of experimentation. So I think their type shows a sort of progression through the late 80s to now. I guess my answer is yes, some do look dated, but I would count on them constantly updating and adding new, more contemporary faces. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to look back at any foundry&rsquo;s work ten years from now and think the same thing. I still personally enjoy the italics for triplex as well as the caps. Those curves on the stems of the lowercase really bug me though.</p>
<p>I remember seeing Citizen on the cover for the movie <a href="http://www.impawards.com/2001/posters/black_hawk_down_ver1.jpg">Black Hawk Down</a>.</p>

I’ll probably end up using it at some point, but very carefully, because any time I see it lately it’s on some low-budget ad or sign and looks dreadfully awful.</p>
<p>As for the 1990s fonts, I wouldn’t go anywhere near them. Sometimes I use the Brody stuff from that era, but the wacky Emigre types are just horrid. Like the magazine they did a great job of inspiring importan discourse about typography, but like the magazine, no sane person wants to try reading them today.</p>

The Emigre fonts have more of a dirty anarchic feeling that reminds me of all those awful bands from the 1990s who couldn’t stop whining about how much it sucked to be white, male, and middle-class. I wasn’t a design then, and don’t really want to revisit the era.</div>

Brody typefaces is maybe good, but emigre fonts i think is much better - distinctive style, content, meaning, phylosophy those are things because of which these faces is so good, and using these fonts is another thing. And feeling is just a feeling its a thing superficial, warm futuristic feeling today, will be weak outdated feeling tomorow its all influence of context. dont agree?</div>

<p>Au Bon Pain uses Dalliance effectively, I&rsquo;ve seen missionary used quite well in fashion magazines, and I think I&rsquo;d have to outright disagree on Matrix II, Los Feliz, Eidetic, Council, and especially Priori (although <a href="http://virusfonts.com/">Barnbrook&rsquo;s work</a> can be equally hit or miss). I also don&rsquo;t mind the caps for Ottomat, but that&rsquo;s pushing it. I don&rsquo;t think Poppi even qualifies,  I think it looks rather modern myself.</p>
<p>There is a case to be made for a lot of the others; remedy looks like the paying man&rsquo;s Party LET. Most of the ones that you and I agree on were made more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>Once again though, Filosofia, Mrs Eaves, Tarzana, Vista, &amp;c seem to be their recent breadwinners, so I&rsquo;d count on Emigre producing those more-so than something like lunatix. I feel as if Emigre has done well recently distancing themselves from trendy/fad-y themes.</p>

Cholla, Filosofia, Malaga, and Vendetta (tho it looks so small) all work well, stylish and just timeless enough. And, I should add, they&rsquo;re still gently priced. Storm Foundry&rsquo;s historical revivals also have eccentricities that require discrimination and care. And the point above about all those high-x-height ITC faces from the 70s, originally intended for advertising instead of regular editorial use&ndash;that&rsquo;s true too.

<p>I am actually writing a book about typography, and in this book I wrote a full article about Zuzana Licko&rsquo;s Mrs Eaves, and another one about Xavier Dupre&rsquo;s Vista, in which I say a lot of nice things. I am actually in regular contact with Ms Licko herself, and everything is fine. I have been one of the biggest fans of Emigre since years, I have countless printed specimens, Emigre magazines, I receive their catalog and I actually have some of the typefaces licensed. I also wrote, and think, that it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly hard to use most of these types today mostly because of their success in the nineties, which is not rude or bad or whatever, but simply true. Read again, mate, because that is really what I said, asking the fellow typophiles around their point of view, which is sometimes the same, sometimes very different. I, for example, agree totally with Tiffany when she says that Emigre proudly stands by their old designs, and I didn&rsquo;t think of it that way before; I came to this different point of view through discussing with the clever people around.</p>
<p>Now, this being said, you subscribed here 8 weeks ago, and you posted only one messsage - this one. Do <em>you</em> actually have any interesting critic to formulate?</p>

A few years ago they were top of the hype, so much overused that they are now paying the price of success; I can’t go through Emigre’s catalog without seeing “1990” written everywhere. I mean, apart from a few types (Malaga, Vista, Mrs Eaves, Tribute), who can actually still use today types such as Triplex, Matrix Script, Keedy, Dogma, Democratica, Dead History or Citizen?</p>
<p>&ldquo;top of the hype&rdquo; &hellip;.what exactly do you mean here? Hype has a negative connotation.
&ldquo;so much overused that they are now paying the price of success&rdquo;. Really? So if you do excellent creative work, and it becomes popular, you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;pay a price&rdquo; later?</p>

<p>I think someone hit a nerve, but I don&rsquo;t think David intended to be disdainful to Rudy, Zuzana &amp;c. I&rsquo;m a huge Emigre fanboy (proud owner of an Emigre tshirt-in Dogma no less), but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t offer some criticism. I prefer to think of Emigre&rsquo;s types as fashionable. Imagine what the clothes from high-fashion designers from Paris, Milan and New York were making in the late 80s and early 90s. Emigre was kind of the place where typefaces were rethought, and the result was a lot of experimental type designs. Some were successful in the short run, some not at all, and some that I don&rsquo;t think that I could work without. I&rsquo;m actually starting to lean towards Mrs Eaves being sort of fad-y.</p>
<p><em>Hype has a negative connotation.</em>
Sometimes, yes. Emigre was hyped and criticized. What David is saying is nothing new. I believe Massimo Vignelli and Paul Rand would truly have gotten a reaction out of you.</p>

<p>When something is overused, it pays the price of success: well, yes, it&rsquo;s sad but true. when a talented artist makes something which totally fits its era and is overused, it gets so much associated with it that on the day the fashion changes, the work (in this case, a typeface) follows the path to oblivion and shame. You think i&rsquo;m wrong? well, cooper black was &ldquo;top of the hype&rdquo; in 1968, and it was the synonym of cheap in 2000. brody was &ldquo;top of the hype&rdquo; in 1987, and you can hardly find one of his types in use today. 90% of aldo novarese&rsquo;s types are unavailable on a digital format today, because nobody wants them; even though he was a great artist, his types were so much used in the sixties and seventies that they are now &ldquo;paying the price&rdquo;. it&rsquo;s very sad, yes; it is as sad as admitting that it&rsquo;s hard for me today to use typefaces i really, really loved, such as dogma or triplex, but it&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who can actually use these types today: that was a question, you know. I know i can not use these types anymore myself, not because they are not top of the hype, but because they have been once. so i was wondering if anyone else can, with success. and then I had interesting answers. and then, I had yours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>hope you understood me this time, if no i&rsquo;ll explain again, no problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It does seem like type has a cycle of excitement over novelty and distinctive voice and then a return to core values and around again as the core values start to feel too staid. But the cycle may be disrupted now. Or the cycles may be getting closer &amp; closer so that you just have near simultaneous activity in several directions. This whole &ldquo;decorative&rdquo; cycle has lasted a remarkably long time! Simultanaity may have the effect of extending the life of all trends by ensuring that the point of over-exposure takes longer to get to. And yes, this is all just theoretical waffle just barely related to the topic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but IMHO Emigre fonts look a bit undecided, they don&rsquo;t know if they want to be revolutionary or conservative, particulary, Mrs. Eaves. What was the aim of this project? a traditional font? a revolutionary font? it&rsquo;s certainly not a font we needed, and it doesn&rsquo;t have any special background like Baskerville did, an special and strong motivation that lead to the font that couldn&rsquo;t have been done in any other way. Emigre is certainly special in the experimental field, although it&rsquo;s weak for a functional type, as we see in the Black Hawk Down cover.
For a eighties based project it&rsquo;s cool, but Emigre fonts are more like art, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be using them for something functional.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ha! Journal is hands down the best thing Emigre ever delivered. Emigre started out in the PostScript Type 3 years (the only free font format licensing around) and learned the lessons of optimizing for low-resolution output devices quite well. There are very few typefaces that actually look better at smaller size. Journal is one of them. If it looks slightly Czech, well, it is, can&rsquo;t do any better than that. As Goudy said, those old guys stole all our best ideas (I paraphrase).</p>

<p>There are typefaces by Emigre which are milestones, what you consider &ldquo;dated&rdquo; largely depends on how much and how you have seen it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hmm..this IS an interesting thread. Yes I do agree that some of their faces are EXTREMELY dated..but there are others that I use regularly.</p>
<p>A rundown:</p>
<p>Mrs Eaves - still good for some things, just not setting lots of type in!
Tribute - Used it recently for an Order of service, turned out quite nice.
Missionary - technically useless but appeared here and there as fillers in the now(sadly) defunct Blueprint (Martha Stewart magazines)
Brothers - still see it on and off&hellip;definitely one I keep
Base Nine - seriously, it&rsquo;s not that bad..but must be used sparingly
Solex - somehow reminds of Heinze Ketchup. Decent condensed sans.
Malaga - don&rsquo;t have it but lust after it anyways!
Vista - Not bad either&hellip; but many sans look like this too:(
Dalliance - IDEA mag used it for the first few pages of their issue on Book Design in China. Very well used/put together.
Cholla - I bet it still has uses out there..don&rsquo;t have it so I can&rsquo;t say.
Filosofia - seen books set in this, might be a bit too much in novels but I used it for setting a coffee table book.
Priori - dare I say this? I&rsquo;m using it now for headers in a cookbook(on CHINESE food mind you) but it works. Gill would have been too boring, the quirky-ness helps that little bit!</p>
<p>The rest.. sorry. I doubt it..but you never know?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t write them off completely. They&rsquo;ve definitely produced a bunch of gems, and some duds of course, but which foundry hasn&rsquo;t? When I was in design school I thought the world of Emigre and it&rsquo;s catalogues!</p>

<p>Great, Tiffany. Yes, it&rsquo;s that, for most of them: they were not used appropriately. You need to be very conscious to appropriately use typefaces born in the research which permeated those years, if you don&rsquo;t… it&rsquo;s extremely worse than misusing a Brush Script or a digital Helvetica.</p>
<p>Of course, my typeface (Ottomat) is &ldquo;dated&rdquo; to me on a personal level, but just in the sense that it belongs to a precise initial phase of my work (I started around 1993), and maybe it makes no sense to improve it (funny someone mentioned Ottomat used in all-caps, since capitals were always &ldquo;out of place&rdquo; in Ottomat, which started as a lowercase alphabet, many reflections on this…)</p>
