  on the packaging of Stay Puft Marshmallows from the movie Ghostbusters. Any ideas?  Reminds
  me of an old filmtype typeface I see alot from work from that era. '

  body: "I don't think this is a Filmotype face that has been revived yet, but searching
    for \"funny retro\" at MyFonts turned up a few similar styles: Marvin, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/animated-gothic/|Animated
    Gothic]], Super Delicious and Sock Hop. I linked the Bob Alonso font, because
    I thought it was most similar to your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
