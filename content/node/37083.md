    your t-shirt says or means? I have that one too, and I''ve had at least two people
    ask me on the subway! :-D'

  body: Ricardo, I have that shirt also, and people regularly ask about it when I
    wear it. To me it's the best Typophile shirt (and not a winner!) because it's
    a design that relates to the body well, as apparel, and sparks conversation. Unless
    you don't want that, because people will ask!

  body: Thanks, William. I guess the reason is that it's slightly more cryptic (to
    an outsider) than "California Job Case" or "Anatomy of an A"! Although one guy
    thought the California Job Case design had to do with architecture.  :-)
