body: I got a request from a tourist who visited this park in the Canary Islands to
  ID the typeface. So far I can&#39;t spot it. <BR>Any ideas? &#40;the small type
  looks different &#40;N has a serif on apex&#41;, so I am afraid it isn&#39;t much

  body: Oh come on guys/gals!  The M and F seem quite distinctive. Would they custom
    design a font just for the signage in a park? <BR> <BR>No one has any ideas at
    all? <BR> <BR>

  body: Sorry Mike but I couldn&#39;t find anything yet. The &#34;A&#34;s that  <BR>are
    paired with that typical &#34;M&#34; shape are very different  <BR>in the faces
    I&#39;ve found up till now. I&#39;m still looking tho.

  body: Yes definitely, there&#39;s a whole bunch of antique looking  <BR>serif faces
    with peculiar proportions that almost fit the bill.  <BR>We had a thread once
    which listed <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/9063.html" target="_blank">
    quite a few</a> of those.

  body: Thanks Mark &amp; Yves, the Cochin suggestion is good, although the Berthold
    Le Cochin &#40;in FontBook&#41; looks closer than the Nicholas Cochin, although
    I can&#39;t find it on the web, even at Berthold. The A &amp; N are less &#39;eccentric&#39;
    looking, for lack of a better term. The F is a good match. <BR> <BR>Yves, you
    said it had &#39; a typical M&#39;, but for some reason it looked really deformed
    and exaggerated by the serif &#39;wings&#39; at the apexes &#40;apices?&#41; and
    the stroke contrasts. Perhaps the shadows made it look more distorted to me than
    it was. <BR> <BR>The fonts mentioned in the other thread were &#39;classic&#39;
    looks, but not very close to this.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll call of the hunt with that
    idea from Mark. <BR> <BR>Thanks
