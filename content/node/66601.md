  Chinese foundries. I'm looking specifically for simplified Chinese fonts, and I
  would be doubly satisfied to find people who design fonts that have both traditional
  and simplified character sets.\r\n\r\nI'm not so much interested in individual fonts
  as the designers themselves, because I'm interested in the development and evolution
  of what's been brought out.\r\n\r\nI know that mainland China is quickly emerging
  out of the cultural dark ages that ran from the 50s-80s, but I've still had trouble
  located quality stuff. Most of what I've found online is sites that have poorly
  formatted files that look to have come from the design divisions inside of major
  companies. China is a huge place however, so I reckon there has to be some excellent
  foundries out there.\r\n\r\nSingapore also officially uses simplified Chinese, so
  I can't help but wonder if there's any designers there doing interesting things.
  I've found a few decent companies in Hong Kong and Taiwan that have more of a focus
  on traditional character sets, so I haven't really paid much attention to them.\r\n\r\nI've
  searched these forums and I've been unable to find much on this topic, so I apologize
  if this subject has already been brought up."

  body: The major type foundries in China, meaning Mainland China, include Changzhou
    SinoType Technology, Founder Group, and Hanyi Keyin. There are Taiwan-based type
    foundries that also design and market Simplified Chinese fonts, such as Arphic
    Technology and DynaComware. I hope this helps.
