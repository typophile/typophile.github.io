  and I would like to know where to start. I tend to learn well from books but I know
  there are a lot of books with a lot of type theory/history in them and not a lot
  of practical direction. It's the latter that I want at this stage having ingested
  already enough former for the moment. \r\n\r\nI have two titles in mind: 'designing
  type' and 'Letter letter' from typophile's forum history, these seem to be the most
  discussed, I am curious to know which you think would be better, or if you have
  any better options. I realize the best-case scenario is for me to become an expert
  in hand-drawing all of the typefaces from typographic history in pen and ink and
  completing a four-year apprentiship in sign-writing, but surely there must be a
  middle-way.\r\n\r\nthanks for your time and I understand if you might baulk at the
  prospect of answering an oft-asked question\r\n\r\nNick"

    Bible</a> by Leslie Cabarga has great practical stuff on how to design fonts and
    also on hand lettering. I highly recommend it. The <a href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/Triumvirate\">Triumvirate</a>
    is frequently recommended on these forums. Of those, I've read The Elements of
    Typographic Style. It is a good reference guide, with much practical information
    on font design and typography.\r\nI have not read Designing Type nor Letter letter.
    The forum threads and <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/articles/designing_type_/\">this
    review</a> have led me to believe that Designing Type doesn't have much on actual
    <em>type design</em> though.\r\n\r\nEron\r\n"

  body: "I have a copy of Letterletter. It's big on theory, abstract argument and
    formation of letterform via handwritten strokes, but if you want practical advice
    on making digital fonts, then Leslie Carbarga's work is pretty much it. He put
    out a companion book to the LFLB called Learn Fontlab Fast. They're both at www.flashfonts.com,
    but IMHO the LFLB is the better book and probably exactly what you're asking for.\r\n\r\nCarbarga
    favours Illustrator as a drawing program, but all of the material he covers is
    equally applicable to FreeHand, if that's what you prefer.\r\n\r\nHaving got the
    Karen Cheng book out of the library, I have to agree with what Eron says above,
    and the conclusion that Peter Bilak makes in his review. It's a book about comparisons
    rather than any particular process.\r\n\r\nIn my own stumbling attempts to find
    out more I would say the advice Lucas de Groot has about interpolation of weights
    at http://www.lucasfonts.com/index_neu.html is good value, as is the process documented
    at www.typeworkshop.com by the lovely people at underware."

  body: "This is a difficult question. I don't think there really is a book about
    designing type, despite a number that make that claim. There are lots of books
    about looking at type, of which Karen Cheng's is a good example, and some very
    good books about the history of type (which were my references when I started
    out), but I don't think there are any books that really describe a process. I
    rather hope Gerry Leonidas and his colleagues teaching in the MA programme at
    Reading will write one eventually, based on the experience of running that programme,
    having been able to test theory and praxis over a number of years and with a good
    number of graduates working on varied projects.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I think
    Michael Harvey's <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Creative-Lettering-Today-Michael-Harvey/dp/1558214534/sr=8-1/qid=1157342999\">Creative
    Lettering Today</a></em> is one of the better introductory books, and a good companions
    to Leslie Cabarga's <em>Logo Font and Lettering Bible.</em>\r\n\r\nAlthough Hrant
    will probably come and beat me up again, I'm going to recommend Gerritt Noordzij's
    <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stroke-Theory-Writing-Gerrit-Noordzij/dp/0907259308\">The
    Stroke</a>.</em> But let me be very clear that I don't think one should take Noordzij's
    work as a prescription for creating typefaces based on calligraphic or other written
    forms. What I like about <em>The Stroke</em> and parts of <em>Letterletter</em>
    is that they encourage one to think about the elemental construction of letterforms,
    from the inside-out. This is not sufficient in itself to designing a good typeface,
    because one also needs to understand letterforms from the outside-in, i.e. from
    reading, but I simply don't know any other works that are as thought-provoking.
    These are not manuals on how to design a typeface: they are jumper cables to get
    you thinking about letterform construction. Even if you even up disagreeing with
    everything Noordzij writes, the books will have done their job."

  body: "Wow, thanks so much everyone for your generous advice. The consensus seems
    to be the slightly unhinged logo/font/lettering bible with glowing reviews on
    typophile and everywhere I looked on the web.\r\n\r\nIf there is anyone in Australia
    who would like to sell me a copy, it would sure be cheaper then shipping it from

  body: "Wow, something else Hrant and I agree on.\r\n\r\nThe Hess book is wonderfully
    useful in helping you understand how letterforms work with different weights and
    widths (and secondarily with different styles). I haven't looked at it in many
    years, but if I had ever tried to do a big family early on in my typographic education,
    it would have been invaluable.\r\n\r\nThat being said, if you're going to start
    with just one book, Cabarga's may be more broadly useful, though it doesn't instill
    the same discipline of thinking about things.\r\n\r\nT"
