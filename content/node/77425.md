  Christmas and a really lovely New Year to you all, with the attached little card,
  printed on an Adana HS2 letterpress (sorry for the not-so-perfect image). No prizes
  for IDing the typeface used.\r\n\r\nwith warm regards,\r\n\r\nTamas[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MerryXmasTypohile_4751.jpg]"
