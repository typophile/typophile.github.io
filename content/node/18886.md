body: "I am freelancing at an agency that does a lot of supermarket ads. They are
  in a process of changing from Quark to InDesing CS, and came accross a small problem.\r\n\r\nWhen
  typing prices without cents they use ,- (50,-) kerned so, that the hyphen is flush
  left with the full stop. Font used is Helvetica Neue Heavy Condensed. When there
  are cents, they use superscript. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to define the .- pair so,
  that it would behave the same way every time, regardess the size of the font, while
  the kerning of numbers would stay normal? And if it's possible, how do I do it?"

    body: "Sebilar: \"Without trying it: isn\u2019t this possible with nested styles?\"\r\n\r\nIt's
      a bit tricky with nested styles, because there isn't a gap between numbers and
      .- and the amount of numbers vary between 1 and 4. Or at least I haven't figured
      it out, yet.\r\n\r\nApparently it is possible to define a single kerning pair
      for just one font in Quark, which is what they have been using until now."

  body: The easy way to kern is place your curser between the characters and option
    left arrow key to tighten the kerning pair. Option right arrow key to loosen the
    kerning pairs. It also works if you highlight the whole word and option left arrow
    key to tighten the word and you get the rest

  body: Note, in the method Dan explains above, that Adobe InDesign adusts kerning
    in 20/1000em increments by default which I find excessive, especially at display
    sizes. Thankfully, this can be adjusted to your liking in "Units & Icrements"
    preferences under "Keyboard Increments", I use 5/1000em.

  body: "Dan,\r\n\r\nThank you, but I'm still looking for a way to do this automatically.
    There are usually tens of prices per page, and only some of them don't have cents.
    The people who work on the job 8 hours a day don't want to kern them one by one.\r\nObviously,
    if the function can't be automated, they have to create a character style sheet
    or use your method. That would be ok, but not as fast.\r\n\r\nBert, thank you
    for the link, it looks interesting. They seem to be having problems at the moment
    (page not found), will try again later."

    body: Thank you, Pica. I tried that, but did not get far enough. I had a problem
      with the word gap, which there shouldn't be. But of course that can be solved
      with word spacing. I think the problem is solved!
