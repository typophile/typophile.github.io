  of it was designed by the company's CEO's six year-old daughter. (I'm guessing she
  did the computer).\r\n\r\nIt was submitted as the worst logo ever and featured on
  the front page of Digg (http://www.digg.com/design/The_Worst_Logo_EVER) today. \r\n\r\nI
  actually don't mind it; it's nice to see a more artistic approach to the static
  and cold designs of computer based logos. (I might have used a yellow background
  instead of a pink one though.) At least it's not a web 2.0 style!"

    a font.

  body: "and how about \"no\" background --\r\n\r\nand in full agreement with Patty
    - change that type please - the computer is kind of refreshing - way different
    than the average clip art computer companies have been getting away with for years....\r\n\r\nP.S.
    How could the owner turn down their 6-year old? Also -- it may be considered the
    worst logo by some - but look at all the attention it is getting!"

    not familiar with the company itself, but have heard good things about their products.\r\n\r\nI
    think the logo's better than most, and it does symbolize the company (they're
    a software solutions company.) well. "

  body: "Heh. What a story. This logo is not the worst ever. Not by a long shot. \r\n\r\nThe
    image is too complex and the colors are questionable at best, particularly in
    the screen, but the computer is not bad; very distinct. I agree with Patty 100%
    about the font and Jackie about the background.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of a documentary
    coming out that I'm eager to see. It's called <em><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/mykidcouldpaintthat/\">My
    Kid Could Paint That</a></em>."

    began messing with it.
