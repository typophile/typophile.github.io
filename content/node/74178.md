  have these features:\r\n\r\n1.  Toggle other \u0915eyboard mapped layouts for example,
  languages and diacritics.\r\n2.  Access other fonts through toggling without needing
  going every time to the particular application's micro layer.\r\n3.  Design more
  styles per letter and/or partner with other fonts and thus more styles on a font
  and accessing them  through toggling without needing to go to application's micro
  layer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be interested in also turning the Caps Loc\u0915 into
  a Fonts \u0915ey because there have been comments on the internet that it's purpose
  is not used often by most users.  Thus it is given too much priority and space on
  \u0915eyboards and it could be thus converted to a more useful purpose for example,
  Fonts \u0915ey.\r\n\r\nWould any typography designers and \u0915eyboard coders want
  to start a non-profit organisation for this?\r\n\r\n"

    aims to simplify keyboard layout editing by providing a graphical interface to
    .keylayout files, where the desired characters can simply be dragged onto keys
    as needed. (The Character Palette or Character Viewer, available in the Input
    menu if it has been enabled in System Preferences, is a great place to find the
    characters.)</cite>\r\n\r\nIts major advantage is the custom mapping you create
    only affects your own personal keyboard, so there is no need to press onto others
    to diskard characters you just don't like."
