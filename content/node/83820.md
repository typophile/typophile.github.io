  is how to get the \"save as\" behavior: keep the current VFB & its windows open,

  body: Yep, I already tried that. What happens is that FL saves a duplicate of my
    open font at "your new path." But the filename on the open font doesn't change
    (and thus if I hit "save" again, any changes go into the old file.)

  body: "That works. Thanks.\r\n\r\nDoes a fontindex of -1 have a predictable result
    in other functions that ask for a fontindex, or is this a special behavior of
    UpdateFont()?"

  body: 'fl.UpdateFont(-1) is synonymous with fl.UpdateFont(fl.ifont) in this case,
    but it''s not universal behavior, I think. Actually, using fl.UpdateFont(fl.ifont)
    is more elegant to use than fl.UpdateFont(-1). '

  body: Geez. Amusingly, what I *need* is the behavior Matthew B was trying to avoid.
    Here I was going through some extra contortions to get this behavior. Re-reading
    this just enabled me to drop a bunch of lines of code as unnecessary.  :)
