  body: My HP Laserjet P2015 is great. It's a real workhorse and the output is excellent.

  body: I have an HP Laserjet P2015 as well for proofing type designs. Works great,
    really fast. Slow with bitmap images though, especially in 1200 dpi mode. The
    duplex model has more RAM (faster) and comes rather cheaply, but with a smaller
    toner cart, so the first cart (comes in the box) runs out fast (it's smaller than
    the normal ones), but then you can replace with to the regular size cart.

  body: I really love my Ricoh Aficio SP 3300. It was cheap, has real Postscript 3
    support, does great 1200 DPI prints and Ricoh sells a wonderful velvety black
    toner that produces more consistent prints than the uneven greyish mess I get
    from HP or even Xante.

  body: "James, that sounds incredibly good! Unfortunately, your printer doesn't seem
    to be available over here :-(.\r\nI saw that PS support on yours also appears
    to be an emulation. Is there any decisive importance/advantage to having \"real\"
    PS support? I'm in the market for a printer too, and it seems that everything
    that's halfway in my price range only does PS \"emulation\". I wonder how badly
    that matters."

  body: "Ricoh printers have real postscript. HP uses the emulation. I'm not sure
    it matters as much as it used to, but at one time the emulation software limited
    your printing options. It's probably improved.\r\n\r\nI love my Ricoh too FWIW.
    I have the Aficio AP610N - it does up to tabloid size which I need but you may
    not."

  body: "Are you sure? I'm confused. The Swiss Ricoh website lists \"PostScript\xAE
    3 emulation\" in the <a href=\"http://www.ricoh.ch/products/printers/smalloffice/sp3300dn.xhtml\">specs</a>
    of the printer James mentioned \u2013 whatever that means \u2026 the whole PS
    business seems quite convoluted. \r\n\r\nFWIW, I use a HP printer currently, and
    Dan Reynolds told me over on the German Forum not to use any hinting during the
    design process because the HP emulation tends to misinterpret hints & ends up
    ignoring overshoots. :-|  \r\nConcerns like that would certainly be nice to avoid."

    listed as emulation because that\u2019s the term retailers use for almost any
    Postscript support. "
