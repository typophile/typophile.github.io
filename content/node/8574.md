  body: I could be wrong but I believe the text is Poynter Oldstyle Text, the display
    is Poynter Oldstyle Display and the sans is Poynter Gothic. All are part of the
    readability series from the Font Bureau, which is used by several newspapers and
    magazines. I hope this helps.

    Price uses Dispatch to complement Font Bureau&#39;s Poynter types, OldStyle Narrow
    &#40;display&#41; and OldStyle and Gothic &#40;text&#41;. Allied to a sensitive
    use of colour and lots of white space Courtney has succeeded in designing one
    of our best looking newspapers.&#34;
