  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>What if Cloister &#40;Jenson&#41; and Plantin had

  alt="erwintextroman.gif"> <BR> <BR>Erwin is a news text face designed for use in
  <BR>the Erwin Record, a small, weekly newspaper <BR>in the town of Erwin in northeastern
  Tennessee. <BR>The paper currently uses ITC Bookman as its <BR>body text typeface,
  but the editor is considering <BR>a re-design. <BR> <BR>I based Erwin on two of
  my favorite text faces: <BR>Plantin, the grand-daddy of all news faces, for <BR>sturdiness
  and practicality; and Cloister, my <BR>favorite Jenson-inspired design, for elegance
  <BR>and beauty. The x-height was increased, extenders <BR>decreased, and overall
  width condensed to aid <BR>readability and space economy. <BR> <BR>The chief concerns
  are, of course, readability, <BR>coupled with the rigors of printing on newsprint.
  <BR>In addition, we want a font with a warm, homey, <BR>inviting feel. Plantin and
  Jenson seemed to fit <BR>the bill as models from which to begin. <BR> <BR>Old-style
  numerals will be posted soon. <BR>Small caps, italics, bold and ornaments are also
  <BR>among the planned extensions of this family. <BR> <BR>Any and all comments will
  be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR> <BR>David'

  body: 'I think it&#39;s pretty cool. The problems I see: <BR>1&#41; It&#39;s highly
    expressive, which is sort of anti-news. On the other hand, the smaller the town
    the more &#34;personal&#34; news can be. <BR>2&#41; The x-height isn&#39;t just
    big, it&#39;s massive. The target for these proportions is more around the footnote
    scale. Especially since provincial newspapers tend to set their type a bit large
    &#40;for various reasons&#41;. <BR>3&#41; I would shift more of the vertical space
    from the descenders to the ascenders, for optimal use of line height. <BR>Or combining
    #2 and #3: just make the descenders taller. <BR> <BR>BTW, FYI, AFAIK :-&#41; Christian
    Schwartz&#39;s recent face for the Houston Chronicle was the first Venetian news
    face. Let&#39;s hope for a trend! <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: '&#62; David. It enchants your typography to me, <BR>I believe that it has
    something of classic very <BR>very old. I do not know if it needs a digital <BR>type,
    but I like the respect that you have to him <BR>to your ancestros. Perhaps you
    would have <BR>preocuparte a little in messing up hair it, and <BR>&#34;ungerizarla&#34;
    more;, in order to obtain better <BR>results. Seeing in detail the curve of above
    of <BR>the letters tipo&#34;n&#34;creo that are too round, this <BR>makes a little
    less functional, it drains <BR>contraforma, and the direction clears a little
    to <BR>him that they try to look for the types of fast <BR>reading. As far as
    the subject of contrafotma it <BR>commits I believe that he is a little small,
    since <BR>a type of text &#34;en estructura&#34; it must always look <BR>for the
    square proportion, and not condense it as <BR>much. I believe that Hrant is right
    that needs to <BR>grow x-height, to have better results. In short, I <BR>believe
    that you go by an excellent way, these <BR>making a source very beautiful... ...
    and i hope <BR>you understand i wrotte in spanish, i have to <BR>little of Time,
    and i need eats back to my work... <BR>good luck JP <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; to grow
    x-height <BR>No, I say that there is to lower it. <BR>hhp <BR> <BR> <BR>[Alta
    Vista Babel Fish translation] <BR> <BR> <BR>Part of the problem of exhibiting
    a news text font <BR>at huge display sizes is that it shows it out of <BR>its
    intended context. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve enclosed a comparison of Erwin with three
    <BR>other popular news text fonts: Nimrod MT, <BR>Imperial BT and Olympian. Is
    the x-height/ascender <BR>proportion really that far off? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51277.gif"
    alt="erwinbodycomp.gif"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll take a look at the ascenders again.
    <BR> <BR>The chief complaints that the editor has been <BR>getting about ITC Bookman,
    believe it or not, <BR>are from older readers saying it&#39;s hard to read. <BR>It
    is currently printed at 9.5/10.5, and the <BR>editor doesn&#39;t want to go much
    larger because <BR>Bookman is a relatively wide font already. He&#39;s <BR>looking
    for a narrower font with an inviting look. <BR> <BR> <BR>As far as Hrant&#39;s
    comments about the expressive <BR>nature of the font, I agree that it&#39;s perceived
    <BR>to be sort of anti-news, but that is sort of <BR>the idea. Most news fonts
    are relatively cold <BR>and sterile &#40;not necessarily a bad thing&#41;, but
    <BR>we&#39;re attempting to bring some warmth back into <BR>the design while still
    meeting the concerns of <BR>space, printing demands and transparency. <BR> <BR>Hrant:
    Yes! I saw Christian Schwartz&#39;s Houston <BR>font. It&#39;s beautiful. And
    I agree '

  body: I think your graphic comparing Erwin to other newspaper types demonstrates
    well how soft your outlines are compared to what&#39;s out there. The main change
    between Christian Schwartz&#39;s Houston[1] and other venetian interpretations
    &#40;Adobe Jenson, Goudy&#39;s Californian&#41; is that &#40;aside from x-height,
    proportions&#41; they have subtly modulated strokes and soft curves while Houston
    adopts the simple modulation and sharp lines of conventional newspaper type. Erwin
    would look to me more like a newspaper type, albeit a unique and inviting one,
    if it had more of sharpeness of other newspaper types. <BR> <BR>Btw, I would like
    to see this set in columns. It&#39;s hard to imagine exactly how it&#39;ll set
    from the specimen but your copyright notice in the sample looks very promising.

    And if we could see a paragraph set in this &#39;face, it would be easier for
    us to comment about it too. <BR> <BR>Two minor observations: <BR>- Why are the
    square brackets thinner than the curly brackets and the parenthesis? I&#39;d give

  body: '&#62; Erwin can be set 1/2 a point larger and <BR>&#62; still have better
    word economy than Bookman.  <BR> <BR>But any comparison is incomplete without
    factoring in: <BR>1&#41; The apparent size &#40;where Erwin will probably win&#41;.
    <BR>2&#41; The apparent leading &#40;where Erwin will probably lose&#41;. <BR>and
    <BR>3&#41; The readability, which is extremely hard to measure, but can be gauged
    through an observation of the vertical proportions, the ideal depending on point
    size. At your ~9.5 point, I think Erwin is a bit large on the body. <BR> <BR>The
    &#34;Z&#34;/&#34;z&#34;: I&#39;m no longer sure about what I said before. Although
    in the UC I think it&#39;s tangibly distracting. <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;m not convinced
    that sharp corners and <BR>&#62; straight lines are much of an advantage <BR>&#62;
    in newspaper type.  <BR> <BR>I think they do work better, because they&#39;re
    more neutral/newsy. <BR> <BR>Some micro stuff: <BR>- I think the &#34;g&#34; is
    still off. <BR>- The &#34;r&#34;, &#34;v&#34; and &#34;y&#34; are too wide. <BR>-

    a weekly, small-town local newspaper. No hard-hitting news, just local stuff \u2013
    so the purpose is to create a warm, friendly text face that will be legible and
    readable at small sizes, and will withstand the rigors of newspress printing.\r\n\r\nThe
    roman was designed using elements of Plantin and Cloister, with an increased body
    height, so it has a very Arts & Crafts feel to it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErwinTextRomanSpec8x6_6596.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    italic draws from both of these sources, but also contains many Baroque features:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErwinTextItalicSpec8x6_6176.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see, there are several alternate glyphs available, as well as small caps

    earlier, but I'd like to say that I like that you took Cloister as an inspiration,
    and made a large x-height typeface with it. I like the \"arts & crafts\" feel
    and that it's \"designed for readability and economy.\" And the open /P/ is very
    nice -- something I like and that you don't typically find in a Jenson or a Golden
    Type.\r\n\r\nI'd love to get a close look at the tops of your /b/d/h/k/l/. It;s
    a quirk, but I like the top serif on those letters in Golden Type and Phinney
    Jenson. URW's cut of Cloister may have my favorite rendering of these serifs,
    from what I've seen so far, but its x-height is unfashionable.\r\n\r\nI would
