  and still haven't quite found Ira's voice yet. I've spent quite a while looking
  and am ready for some outside suggestions. \r\n\r\nFor those who've never heard
  the show, check it out at http://www.thisamericanlife.org. \r\n\r\nThanks so much
  for any insights you can provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: apparently em dashes
  aren't kosher in subject lines? I'll keep that in mind for the future."

    monotony.

    but likes the low, quirky side\u2014in a detached way.\r\n\r\nMaybe [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/bree/light/|Bree

    very distinct typographic voice. Check out the magazine if you're not familiar
    with it.

  body: "<cite>I love Bree but I think it is a little too feminine for Ira.<cite/>\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    had that same thought. I went to see him speak a few years ago.  It may be generational,
    but he doesn\u2019t project with a typical male bravado. He\u2019s not androgynous\u2014that\u2019s
    not it\u2014but is balanced maybe in a way that a generation that hasn\u2019t
    been raised on macho can be.\r\n\r\nThis is a fun one."

    To me it looks literary and quirky.

  body: I'd say the face is less important than the typesetting. I'd want it to be
    very loose, open, floating. That with a face that leans towards the lighter side
    would work for me.

  body: There seems to be a disjunct between his voice, which is contemporary, and
    his visual style and the present graphics, which are retro-modern. So it's probably
    best to stick with the nostalgic look, and go for a face that was popular in mid
    20th century America. Handwritten script is also a good way to suggest a voice.
