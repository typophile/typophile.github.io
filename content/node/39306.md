  some of the international Typophile contingent, as well as take a look at some design
  firms. \r\n\r\nSo two questions:\r\n1. any London typophile members?\r\n2. any London
  design companies that are worth looking at, maybe stopping by for a tour of the
  office?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "In Reading is this year's MA Typeface Design class at the University of Reading
    (the class of 2008, I mean). No public list of the students is posted anywhere
    online yet, but Paul Hunt\u2014another Typophile moderator and regular\u2014is
    in the group, too. One of last year's (2007) graduates is still in town, and several
    more are scattered across the country. We don't have an awful lot of contact with
    the local British typographic scene, though (at least I don't\u2026 this is what
    happens when you are only going to live in a place for a year, I guess :-(  ).\r\n\r\nThe
    Department of Typography and Graphic Communication here *is* worth a day trip
    if you'll be in London for awhile. I'm sure we could round up a good group to
    go for a pint. Feel free to contact me over my Typophile profile anytme."
