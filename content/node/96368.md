body: "I'm trying to identify a font that looks very close to Univers on the EPA website.
  I have to create a banner that matches the dark blue headings you see on these two
  links:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.epa.gov/smm/ - \"Sustainable Materials Management\"\r\nhttp://www.epa.gov/fgc/
  - \"Federal Green Challenge\"\r\n\r\nthe letters that are particularly hard to match
  are the lowercase a, t and g. It looks close to Univers, but I'm not 100% sure.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help"

  body: Yeah, you might be right. I kept thinking it was something not so common,
    and the font identifying sites never said Arial, but it looks like a match. Thanks!

  body: Maybe they didn't catch it because, especially in the second sample, it looks
    a bit either vertically compressed or horizontally stretched.
