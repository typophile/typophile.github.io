body: This font usually appears in pre-1990s Hungarian scientific (especially linguistics)
  publications. Its f-ligatures are very interesting. Can you help me identify the
  font? Also, is it possibly  available in digitized format?

  body: While not an exact match, I think you could get close with an italic of a
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-century/">Century.</a> I'll keep
    looking for that exact match. Where is your sample from? Pre-digital? (pre-1990s?)

      book is from 1982, and so most probably pre-digital.\r\n\r\nhttp://budling.nytud.hu/~cash/H_sample/H_sample01.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://budling.nytud.hu/~cash/H_sample/H_sample02.jpg\r\n\r\nI
      kind of suspect it is some variant of Modern, but I do not know which version."

  body: Nah, I looked at De Vinne and the structure of the bowl on the lc 'a' is quite
    different, which makes me wonder if we can attribute the inconsistencies to interpretation
    during the digitisation. Of course, it all depends how close you want to get.
