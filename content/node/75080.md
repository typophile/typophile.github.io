body: "Hi, all, has anyone seen this behaviour before?\r\n\r\nI am working with a
  TrueType font that has an empty GPOS table in it. (not sure why, but I recall something
  about this being needed for kerning to work in certain apps? Maybe?)\r\nAnyway,
  when I run CacheTT to generate VDMX, LTSH and hdmx tables, the GPOS table is apparently
  removed. \r\n\r\nI haven't run anything except CacheTT, and the only difference
  aside from the 3 tables it should generate appears to be the removal of this 0 length
  table. I don't know why CacheTT would do this?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nJason C\r\n\r\n"
