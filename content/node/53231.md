  body: "I'm not sure if it was ever a commercially available font since it was a
    promotional ad for Suddler & Hennessey (Lubalin was once their VP/Creative Director)
    and may have been one of their unique headline film fonts.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/herb_lubalin_116_4154.JPG]\r\nThe
    closest re-appearance of the face I found was Lubalin's \"oh! ah!\" letterhead
    design (featured in U&lc) which was actually handlettered by [[Tony Di Spigna]]."

    notes</a> that this ad uses lettering by John Pistilli, which makes sense. So,
    not a font, but similar to the same artist\u2019s Pistilli Roman. "
