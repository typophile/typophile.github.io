  body: "Some of the letters look just like [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces4.html|Joric]]
    (in the upper left), mixed with some more conventional sans letterforms that could
    come from almost anywhere. The fact that this was Joric Ultra suggests other weights
    also existed, and perhaps one of those was used for a digital partial revival
    of an old film type (the image is from the Phil's Photo book from 1985).\r\n\r\n-

    actually is an expanded version of Mass. You can find <a href=\"http://www.typetype.net/cat/fontomas.html\">Mass</a>
    in the Fontomas CD, scroll down and you have a PDF of it.\r\n\r\n"
