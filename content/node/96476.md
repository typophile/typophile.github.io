  are filled with their uppercase counterpart. That is, typing in lowercase in Trajan
  still produces uppercase type.\r\n\r\nHaving completed an uppercase font in Robofont,
  is there a quick  way to copy the glyphs, their spacing, and their kerning pairs
  to the lowercase characters?\r\n\r\nI really have no skill in Python, which is why
  I'm coming to Typophile for help instead of the Robofont forums, which only provide
  answers way over my head."

    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant

    but maybe that's me. \r\n\r\nIn any case, if you want the \"lower case\" glyphs
    to be composites of the Upper case, you can just click the \"A\", hold shift,
    click the \"Z\", to select all caps, then  choose Edit>copy as components. Then
    use the shift method to select all the lower case glyphs and then paste. \r\n\r\nJason

  body: "@jasonc @ T\xE9 Rowan Thanks guys. Those both work for the glyph itself and
    its sidebearings. Is there a good way to copy the kerning pairs and values of
    a letter? \r\n\r\nI could put the UC and LC characters in groups together, but
    then I'd still have to re-enter all the old kerning pairs with the new group names."
