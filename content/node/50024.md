body: "Hi, My first post. This is a new idea and personal project I\u2019m working
  on for a designers creative resource. I\u2019m really not good at designing for
  myself and get in a rut after a while trying. This web site will include podcast,
  articles, tutorials or anything to inspire other designers. Also what do you think
  of this idea, do we really need another website out there? Is this different enough?
  Honest feedback wanted here on the brand, colors and look please. Feel free to tear
  into this one if you see issues. Thank you in advance for your constructive criticism.\r\n\r\nKind
  Regards\r\n\r\nDA\r\n\r\nhttp://geocities.com/lyletrush2001/creative-revelation-logo.jpg\r\n\r\nP.S.
  I was trying to embed the image inside the source of the HTML here but I could not.
  I'm not much of html or coder person."

    Creativity has only one e.\r\n\r\nNot sure about the colours \u2013 they're fairly
    low-contrast on white.\r\n\r\nI don't think it says 'revelation'. In fact it looks
    more like revolution.\r\n\r\nA revelation is an unveiling, an exceptional disclosure
    even. I don't think your mark reflects this.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoss"

    I highly recommend looking at what else is already out there. Your website will
    need to fill a need that isn't already available (or at least percieved as not
    already available). To simply offer similar things that another website successfully
    provides will fail to generate sustained interest in your website. \r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\nMichael

  body: I agree with your comments, thank you. :) Everyone seems to have similar feedback.
    I'm really not good at doing design for my own stuff. I don't know why that is...
    I'll keep this post up to date, thanks again.

  body: Thank you PenANDink, Finlay it's been over 40 hours or more! many late nights
    and all this while holding a full time design job. So I think I got it this time.
    Now I have to move on the website and actual production of the vodcast. Thank
    you very much, feedback is still welcome, I will still be tweaking but moving
    on. Like I said it's very hard to be a designer and the client at the sometime
    but your feedback has really helped me out with that block. This has evolved from
    something that was way off track into something I can be kind of happy with. Peace
    to you! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/creative-revelation-logo_4126.jpg]

  body: "Maybe it is the colours or the names but this has a religious feel. I cannot
    see the point of the little flick on the v \u2013 it affects the kerning of iv,
    perhaps you will need to kern out the other characters, which might work with
    the tracking on Revelation, the split-C really reminds me of something I cannot
    bring to mind at the moment, but, especially with the gradient, it renders the
    C less legible.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that the second iteration is a step back from
    the first. Personally in this situation (designing for designers) I default to
    as simple as possible \u2013 no icon, simple type, simple alignment, single colour
    \u2013 as basic as basic gets, but getting the choice of typeface and the kerning
    spot on.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Maybe the religious touch is created by the round gradient - "beginning to
    see the light" - in combination with the purple.
