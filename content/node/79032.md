  say the artist name, song title, album title and record label and "CD", "Video Director",
  "Video Producer", "Songwriter" and "Record Producer."[img:sites/default/files/old-images/(Unknown)%20-%20Still%20009_5667_5341.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/cmt_1993ss_a_5006.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/cmt_1993ss_a_5006.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/cmt_1993ss_b_5910.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/cmt_1993ss_c_3519.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/(Unknown)%20-%20Still%20023_4843_6026.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/(Unknown)%20-%20Still%20024_5532_3901.jpg]

  body: "An urgent request, apparently! :) I see this popping up quite often these
    days.\r\n\r\nJan (and all your other replies) are right, it really must be a version
    of Futura.\r\nHave you looked at how many versions MyFonts lists alone? \r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/futura/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/futura-nd/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/futura-bq/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/futura/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/\r\n(there
    are more, don\u2019t forget about Futura clones.)\r\n\r\nAt the time Futura was
    released, other foundries came up with similar fonts, to ride on the \u201CFutura
    Wave\u201D; one of them being Neuzeit Grotesk:\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/search/(neuzeit+grotesk)/fonts/]]\r\nMaybe
    that is a good direction for you?\r\n\r\nA general problem with your request is
    that your sample images are really low-res, so it is difficult to make up any
    conspicuous features of the typeface. Also the all-caps / small-caps settings
    doesn\u2019t help \u2026 :)"
