body: This is the first typeface i have ever designed. I currently attend SCAD and
  took Intro to Typeface Design which is a 10 week course. I went the experimental
  route and really wanted to create something new. Its nowhere near refined but my
  teacher told me to upload it to this to see what kind of feedback i get :) let me
  know!
