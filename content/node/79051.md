  body: "I don't think that's a font, partly because the letters are so awkward. The
    'm' in 'from' looks more like an 'n'. Similar might be <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/brio/\">Brio</a>,
    which doesn't have the right 'e', however, or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/romany/\">Romany</a>,
    which has a similar 'e', but would need to be slanted.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
