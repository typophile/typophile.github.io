  help me please.\r\n\r\n1. How do I insert an icon for my ID in Typophile?\r\n\r\n2.
  Which is the ideal size in mm and resolution for inserting / posting images?\r\n\r\n3.
  How do I post a PDF file in a thread (instead of an image - which is the default
  type)?\r\n\r\n4. I have sent a typeface for critiqe under a preliminary name (Thetis)
  and now I want to alter to another one (Semele) which is the final name, do I start
  a new thread under the final name? Do I contact the Typophile webmaster for that?
  What would you advise that I should do?\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
