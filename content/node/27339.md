body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm a recent design graduate and new to the board.\r\n\r\nI've
  been unsuccessful in trying to ID the main typeface on this tee. I know it's likely
  from an old source... a Dover clip art book, an old type specimen book, or Western
  signage reference, etc. I've looked both online and offline everywhere and still
  cannot find its origin. I suppose I can contact Aeropostale, but am confident after
  much perusing here at this wonderful forum that someone is sure to know. Any help
  is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nVenecia"
