    on the <strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/typeid\">Type ID board</a></strong>.
    Members tend not look here for type ID requests. In addition, you will find you
    get more and better feedback if you use your real name as your screen name.\r\n"

  body: "And a bit of friendly advice regarding type IDs. Probably want to do a little
    searching first, and tell people what you think it might be, and/or where you
    have looked. All three of those ID\u2019s can be found in the top three Google
    hits on a simple \u201CApple font, Wonderbra font, Marlboro font\u201D search.
    Two of which are even links to Typophile. Good luck out there!"
