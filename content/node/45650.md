  body: "Look out for fonts imitating old cyrillic calligraphic/manuscript traditions.
    There are plenty of them out there, mostly for cyrillic, some have latin characters
    \"old-cyrillicised\" bundled with them as well.\r\n\r\nMost of the fonts you'll
    find though will be of poor quality, having been made by enthusiasts in the 90
    (not to say all, I'm sure you can find nice ones as well)."

  body: "This identity was designed by Works (Leeds, UK). I expect its a bespoke font.
    I like it also and was curious to find out the agency behind it. They do a lot
    of work for UEFA.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.worksltd.co.uk]]\r\n\r\nHope this helps
    :)"
