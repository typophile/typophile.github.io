body: Is there a common method of referring to type specimens in copy? In other words,
  should I italicize all of them, or should I only italicize the books and set the
  names of shorter booklet/brochure style specimens in quotes?

  body: Wouldn't you italicize the specimen if you are referring it to as a whole,
    and put in quotes if you are referring to a section within?
