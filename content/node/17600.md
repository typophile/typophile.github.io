  i drag my otf onto the icon and i just get a back \"not\" symbol and no resulting
  xml file. i know it's worked for me in the past... is there a setting somewhere
  i need to toggle? please help.\r\nactually... it looks like none of my drag and
  drop behaviors are working. i just tried doing the same thing with a .jpg to my
  photoshop icon and got the same \"not\" symbol. what to do?"

  body: Try opening a command console using 'cmd' from the Start/Run menu. Then try
    running TTX from the command prompt. If this works, the problem is definitely
    related to drag and drop. Have you tried rebooting?

    just substituted \"bat\" by \"exe\" and now it's all good. thanx for the help,

  body: i'm pretty sure it's the one you maintain, adam, but not totally sure. the
    problem was a windows problem though, and not with the tools. everything is working
    properly now that i restored drag/drop functioning to windows.
