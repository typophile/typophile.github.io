  body: "The Gothic one has been identified thanks...please help identify this new
    one\r\nI have an error posting a new message \"Internal server error\"...I'm trying
    with my old message... :) thx\r\n\r\nplease help\r\n\r\nI only have 4 letters...I've
    tried whatthefont identifier with no luck\r\n\r\nThe letter \"i\"  has its right
    arm missing, I think it was done on purpose as a design thing. You can see there
    are twirls added for design. The straight line in the letter \"e\"  is not as
    straight, it kind of narrows from right to left. The tree is obviously there for
    design.\r\n\r\npreview: \r\n<img src=\"http://www.vamonosamigos.com/s-gie.jpg\">
    \r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"
