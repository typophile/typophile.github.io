  turned out a lot like my Suomi Sans family, even though I drew this one without
  any copying and pasting from Suomi Sans.\r\n\r\nI'm not too thrilled with the work
  of the ad agency of the logo (they connected the F and t with the contour of the
  nex letter), but in all I'm pretty happy with the overall result.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fonecta_6374.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is an add for the iPhone app I found from iTunes:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fone_6484.png]\r\n\r\nHere's

    sorry to hear you didn't like the agency's modifications for the logo. Why didn't
    they ask you to do that, too?\r\n\r\nOnnittelut n\xE4in suomeksikin, terveisi\xE4

    properly slanted and corrected 'a', and made a logo with that."
