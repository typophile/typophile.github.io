  body: Look at Minion Ornaments, Linotype Decoration Pi One, Type Embellishments
    One for starters. You can probably find them all at fontshop.com or myfonts.com.
    I don't feel like searching for the links.

  body: "Calligraphic ornaments can be found in font form, digitized clip-art, etc.\r\n\r\nIt
    also depends on what period or style of calligraphic flourish or ornament you
    are looking for.\r\n\r\nTry looking at <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/ornaments/index.htm\"
    target=\"new\"><strong>Ornament fonts</strong></a> available at Typoasis.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I can still flourish!"
