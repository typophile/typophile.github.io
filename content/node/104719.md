  body: i would guess by the rest of the character grouping that they are also e's,

  body: Well 2.png is the Greek letter eta. As for 1.png, it corresponds to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_central_rounded_vowel">the
    open-mid central rounded vowel</a> (in IPA, the international phonetic alphabet)
    and the tilde on top of it should mean that it is nasalized.
