  guys about the iphone app we've finished that's called Helvetication.\r\n\r\nMy
  friend Andrew as an graphic/typopgraphy designer himself, always wants to challenge
  his designer friends about helvetica, but really can't find a good looking one or
  one that is appealing to him.\r\n\r\nWe came up with a simple and elegant app that
  lets you compete with your friends, and also see how well you actually know helvetica
  (vs arial).\r\n\r\nIt's only 99 cents, but it's really a lot of fun! and I hope
  you guys can just try it out\r\n\r\nAlso please tell us anything we can improve
  on, as we are going to do upgrades soon and I really hope you all are happy. Thanks!\r\n\r\napp.itize.us/wp/2010/helvetication/"
