		<div class="commentbody"><p>Also, I would say that if you are a truely good designer with a correct connexion between your eyes and your brain, you should be able to use these ligatures well enough without reading any &ldquo;instructions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This being said, I noticed something wrong in the text you mentioned above:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avant Garde &ndash; the typeface &ndash; was born as a logo for a new magazine of the same name in the mid-60s. Ralph Ginzburg collaborated with Herb Lubalin (pronounced &ldquo;Loo-ba-lin&rdquo;) on four magazines, of which Avant Garde was their second&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not true, Avant-Garde (1968-1971, so a little bit more end of sixties than mid-sixties) was the third of 3, coming after Eros (1962-1963) and Fact (1964-1967).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I am quite surprised to see this text being proposed as an answer to a question that is &ldquo;how to correctly use Avant-Garde&rsquo;s ligatures&rdquo;, because in this essay the author very clearly explains that Avant-garde is ugly and too much linked with the sixties to be used today in another goal than nostalgia. At the end he actually proposes to use Franklin Gothic instead&hellip; Apart from the historical background which proves interesting when true, this text is, imho, a crappy one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, you&rsquo;re right &ndash; the text I linked to does not directly answer the original question! However, it does have a telling remark from Ed Benguiat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only place Avant Garde looks good is in the words Avant Garde. Everybody ruins it. They lean the letters the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that statement <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> partially answer the question, because it gives a clue as to what the wrong use is.</p>

Also, referring to someone else&rsquo;s reading suggestion as &ldquo;crappy&rdquo; is too juvenile for any kind of professional discourse.</div>

Lubalin used the ligatures to achieve super-tightfitted, squared-off layouts, not just for the frisson of their strange letter forms&ndash;he would have considered that to be misuse.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Brooklyn Rob,</p>
<p>Let me make a few things clear: I, like anyone else on this forum, including you, am quite free to say what I want, and that&rsquo;s nice. I agree with you on the fact that I sometimes tend to use ways of saying stuff which might look rude, for I speak this way in my mothertongue (french) and I don&rsquo;t use smileys everywhere, but what can I do. I guess only extremely susceptible people take these comments out of any irony or with a sweet distance. I of course didn&rsquo;t mean to be disrespectful, but I guess I was making a little fun in order to state (seriously this time) that in my opinion, if you need a booklet in order to use correctly a typeface, then it&rsquo;s far much better not to use this typeface.</p>
<p>Regarding this text, I knew it before, because I did a lot of research for my upcoming book, including research about Avant-Garde Gothic. I think this text is crappy, because it clearly tells people &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use this font&rdquo; (at least for modern, up to date design). And, again in my opinion, that&rsquo;s a shame, because this font is really beautiful when correctly used (I&rsquo;m talking only about the capitals here). Ed Benguiat was, in my opinion, very stupid when he said that this typeface looked only nice in the Avant-Garde logo. Herb Lubalin made wonderful covers (including the beautiful example posted by Nick), he also sent a congratulations note to an agency in the seventies who made a real nice use of the ligatures in an Audi advertisement, and if you just look around a little right now, you&rsquo;ll see plenty of great works set in Avant-Garde and full of ligatures. I&rsquo;m sorry if the use of &ldquo;crappy&rdquo; offended you enough to post a comment regarding my youth-speaking.</p>
<p>Nuff said,
dr</p>
