  means 'on'\r\n- a circle sometimes means 'off'\r\n- a vertical line contained in
  a circle sometimes means 'on/off'\r\n- a circle intersected by a vertical line sometimes
  means 'stand-by', sometimes 'on/off'\r\n\r\n1\r\nIs this a system you can recognize?\r\n\r\n2\r\nWhat
  do you think when you see the symbol [circle intersected by a vertical line]?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nsorenolsen\r\n"

    length, you may want to show an example of your intersection.

  body: "Yes I definitely recognise the system, and also have the confusion on the
    4th symbol you mention. Below is the Windows XP shutdown screen which features
    the 3rd and 4th symbols:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ShutdownXP.gif]\r\n\r\nI've
    always assumed that's a binary 1 for \"on\" and \"0\" [zero] for off and the standby
    and shutdown icons combine the two symbols in different ways."

  body: "I think \"I/O switch\" is the technical name for the on/off switch, which
    I believe predaties computers, going back to the early days of electronics. Either
    the switch is on or off, directing or stopping the flow of current. (This doesn't
    address the fact that if the thing is unplugged, its state is actually <i>mu</i>,
    being neither.) \r\n\r\nThis is indeed related to the binary concept. I think
    elliot100  is right about the 'binary 1 for \u201Con\u201D and \u201C0\u201D [zero]
    for off'\r\n\r\nPretty much all the Macs I've used have the circle halfway intersected
    by the vertical bar on the on/off button."
