  out. Somehow, and I have yet to figure it out, I am creating handles that can only
  be extended directly out from their node. This is very useful, except that I have
  no clue how I am creating these nodes/handles and sometimes have to take the handles
  off of the node to change it. What\u2019s going on?"

    I hate them, whatever they are.
