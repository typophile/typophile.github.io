body: "Conventional font categories are practically useless to me. Almost every font
  I make falls under decorative, sans-serif or both. That's not much of a category
  range. Pretty much anything before Morrison I throw into the Ancient category. I
  don't have any need to subdivide that category. For my purposes, those fonts have
  a common thread: not particularly interested. Most if not all font categories deal
  with pre-Morrison archetypes.\r\n\r\nOld sans (Franklin Gothic and other sans with
  ancient flav)\r\nGeo-classical (Futura, Gill, Bernhard Gothic)\r\nHelveticas (Arial,
  and hundreds of other mid-century neutrals)\r\nFrutigers (Museo Sans, Verdana)\r\nHumanist
  sans (Easy. If the baseline is straight, it ain't humanist. Most of what I see categorized
  as humanist are just Franklins.)\r\nGeo-gothic (Avant Garde)\r\nSquare Sans (EF
  Digital, Bank Gothic, Chimes)\r\nSuperelliptical (Microgramma, Eurostile)\r\nBrush
  Sans (Flash, Balloon)\r\nTechincal (DIN, Highway Gothic, stencils, elevator buttons,
  template lettering, labels & other \"ugly\" lettering)\r\nPixel (early computing
  retro, including segmented LED)\r\nMICR (Data 70)\r\nRounded Sans (V.A.G., Arial
  Rounded)\r\nCompacta (Impact, Helv Inserat)\r\nIndustrial slabs (Memphis, Museo)\r\nStops
  (Stop and similar minimalist variants produced in the 70's & 80's. I didn't think
  it was a category until I moved to Japan. Bored font historians looking for a subject
  should try tracking Stop's influence on car emblems, videogames, graffiti and the
  circa 1990 4k demo scene.)\r\nGeo slabs (Lubalin Graph)\r\nStructured scripts (Magneto,
  Deftone Stylus)\r\nScripts (boo)\r\nDecorative (Actually decorative. Fonts that
  look like fire or chrome etc. It's often used as a catch-all category by the ancient
  ones)\r\nMisc (a better name for a catch-all category)\r\n\r\nThese are the categories
  I use in my work. Unfortunately, other people don't see these as categories. A famous
  font grump called my Pirulen font a Bank Gothic knock-off or something but he probably
  wouldn't call every transitional font a Times knock-off. Categories are important.
  Exploring a category sounds better than knocking off.\r\n\r\nIn the future, people
  and machines will make more Geoslabs. They will all resemble Avant Garde Gothic
  a bit. Geometry, baby. People will make Compactas that look somewhat like Compacta.
  They'll make hundreds more MICR and Stop inspired fonts and there will always be
  those who will place them in the Decorative category and call them knock-offs while
  they toil away on the next great, slightly-different Garamond."

    AGES behind.\r\nExample: Myfonts. \r\n\r\nTo simply tag the fonts is not the solution.
    \r\n\r\nI guess, nothing will happen until a case can be made for better categorization
    increases finding and sales.\r\n\r\nA sensible categorization for the future would
    have to be, in my opinion, two- or three-dimensional. That means, one can combine
    a feature 1-\u201CVenetian\u201D with a feature 2-\u201Cflorated\u201D or 3-\u201Cshaddowed\u201D
    and so on. Perhaps it would only work (for searching = finding = sales) when fonts
    get tagged systematically and not arbitrarily. *Inside* the font info data, possibly.\r\n\r\nIf
    one looks for, e.g.: \u201Ca blackletter connected script Greek\u201D \u2013 you\u2019re

  body: "I don't know if categorization is important to everyone else. What I've always
    found frustrating is since they stopped making new font categories the 20th century
    happened and hundreds of new categories blossomed. I don't know what makes a font
    category. Some fonts are so special, that nothing comes close to them. It doesn't
    happen much these days but in the 20th century new font categories happened a
    lot.\r\n\r\nIf I treat a font as a category it means nothing to anyone else. As
    far as most people are concerned it's a tribute, knock-off, \"inspired by\" or
    whatever you want to call it. You think I'm making a tribute to Stop, in my ad
    copy I tip my hat to it. But in my mind, I'm just making a Stop. In my mind Stop
    is a category like a clarendon. When I think about Stops, I not only consider
    the original Stop but all the other Stops I've seen in my life. The way graffiti
    artists interpreted it. The way it was incorporated into the square sans (Roland).
    Amiga intros: lots of Stop influenced fonts there. And, as I mentioned, in Japan,
    Stop wormed its way into the visual culture and it fed back into western techno
    culture.\r\n\r\nNick: damn, I just lost 10 font geek point because I have no idea.

  body: "In some ways, categories are too limiting. Several of my own typefaces are
    difficult to categorize because they are hybrids of traditional categories. I
    find the areas outside of established categories are the most interesting to explore.\r\n\r\nAs
    a type designer, sticking to established categories is actually a quite difficult
    way to make a living. If a category is established, then there probably already
    exists a face that exemplifies that category and will be the default choice for
    designers looking for something in that category. Overthrowing the king of a type
    category isn't impossible--it happens--but the odds are against it. "

    as though classifications have noting to do with what the designer had in mind
    and more to do with whatever the person doing the categorization seems to feel
    is important.  I think I will just make stuff and not bother giving it a category.
    \ If someone else later puts it in a category, I am fine with that as long as
    I don't have to be involved in the nit picking arguments that come with such a
    chore.\r\n\r\nIn his day and age, their is technology that can figure out much
    of the \"what is this thing\" problems.  My only problem is assigning search terms
    or meta-data that will help a person find my type if it fits their needs.  I can't
    be sure I have covered the correct bases to make a reasonably intelligent search.
    When I have gone to a vendor like MyFonts and typed in search criteria, I am often
    amazed at what shows up!  I look at faces out there which I think are capable
    of doing the same kind of job as faces I am working on and see what search terms
    they have used.  It is not unusual for me to see terms that don't seem to fit
    my intention.  That is not to say that \"My Way\" is the right way, it just indicates
    how hard it is to get enough of the search terms that any given font buyer would
    use to find what they want.  I hate the guys who put every search term on earth
    in all their type just to be included in everyones searches, no matter what."

    Most type classification efforts, PANOSE included, define fonts in terms of morphological
    and historical characteristics that make sense to hardcore typographers, but don't
    have much utility to someone who wants to know \"what's a good font for this project?\"
    or \"what font would go with this one I already have?\" \r\n\r\nIn other words,
    putting fonts in  a \"humanist sans\" category is great if you already know what
    a humanist sans is and what it's good for. If you don't, then the category might
    as well be \"florble-glorks.\""
