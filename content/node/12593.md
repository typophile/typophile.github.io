    it points to a type vendor that <em>doesn't</em> support the Typophile Type Identification
    Board? :-D"

  body: 'In my own defense: I linked to Myfonts instead of Fontshop because, quite
    frankly, Fontshop doesn''t have the keyword search. I recognized the font but
    it wasn''t on the tip of my tongue. Doing a search for "Calligraphic" at myfonts
    turned it right up. And then I''m just not going to take the time to go to a whole
    other site for the link. So.... if Fontshop could remedy this discrepancy, we''d
    be in business.'

    the keyword search is being looked into at FontShop."
