  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am in the process of gathering a little information which relates to my graduate studies. If you could take a few minutes to answer the following questions it would make a significant contribution to my research.


1. Name the 10 most common typefaces the average living person has seen through out the course of their life. If you can't name 10, just name as many as you can. Place them in order of frequency.

2. Who sells number one on your list? If more than one person, company, foundry &c sells it, say so. Three references should do.

3. About how much does it cost?

4. If you designed a font that was as common as Times New Roman and sold it as part of a business, what do you suppose would be your annual revenues from this font?

5. For some industries it is not so hard to find out how large they are (sales; profits). Does anyone have any idea how large the typeface industry is on these dimensions?


Thank you for your participation and I look forward to your responses.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1. the "average" results would probably be skewed by China and India. I would narrow the definition of average. Also what people "see" doesn't mean they are the best selling. Graphic designers buy fonts, so those bundled with vinyl sign cutters, those used by books and newspapers, bundled with computers are probably not the best sellers.  

5. Both Monotype Imaging and Bitstream are publically traded companies so you can probably get a good picture based on their annual reports.

This is confusing; why is your thread title "How big is the font industry?" and why are you asking about annual revenues? If sales is of no interest, and visibility is the crucial point, then you are talking about exposure, perception, popularity, which, in western cultures, does not necessarily reflect anything about the "font industry". 

I say this because your questions seem unfocused, and my answers would have to be lengthy and include many caveats and questions in return. For example, what do you mean by "as common as Times"? Since Times is about 90 years old, and has been made available in every type format since its release, and has been included in all major personal computing platforms as a default since the early 80's, it's impossible to consider designing a typeface as widely used, or as easily available, or as thoroughly exposed as Times. This completely ignores the issue of what Times has historically proven to be worth in financial terms, or what you might pay as the total cost of a new design. 

This is the tip of quite an iceberg. </div>

2. Who sells number one on your list? If more than one person, company, foundry &c sells it, say so. Three references should do.

Microsoft/Monotype


3. About how much does it cost?

n/a. It's bundled with Windows and Mac OS.


4. If you designed a font that was as common as Times New Roman and sold it as part of a business, what do you suppose would be your annual revenues from this font?

n/a. The very most ubiquitous fonts are bundled. I don't think "Arial" is a best-seller. Additionally, all the typefaces in question are at least 25 years old.


5. For some industries it is not so hard to find out how large they are (sales; profits). Does anyone have any idea how large the typeface industry is on these dimensions?

Do you only include sales in English-speaking countries? Do you include commissioned work, or only retail sales?

Phil Martin’s Grad from Mark Simonson Font Studios does look a lot by Century Schoolbook, just narrower. I always thought Schoolbook was way too wide. Those publishers just wanted the cost of textbooks to be higher!

People likely want to forget their textbook's, so maybe it's a bad choice.
