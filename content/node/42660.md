  it anywhere. I'm not even sure that is a typeface, and not some hand drawn special
  sort of thing. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ex_4927.gif]

    I can remake it for you in 48 hours, as a custom font. Caps and figures only.\r\n\r\n-Andre"

  body: Is that from a plotter? Interesting mix of extreme x-height and crazy kerning.
    But nice!

    Croquis. Although it is quite quirky it actually works very well in these sort
    of drawings. Thanks Andre, I'll have to get back to you on your offer. \r\n\r\nThord"

  body: "Like minds.  I thought of a rotring when I saw this.  There was one in a
    weekly newspaper I worked for and I wish I had asked for it.  It had a raft of
    adjustments and could even do italics.  You used a relief template with the pointer
    and an engineering pen traced the letter with india ink.  Does the fact that so
    many suspected that was the source mean we\u2019re all grey beards?"
