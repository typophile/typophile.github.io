  Gridnik]], something that has facettes instead of curves. Any suggestions? \r\n\r\nI'm
  also looking for a font that would go well with Foundry Gridnik - I've tried several
  different things but haven't found the right typeface yet. Any suggestions? This
  is for a logo."

    looks right for what we are doing, but now I'm having a hard time finding the
    right typeface for accompanying body text. We'll be using Foundry Gridnik for
    titles, and we've decided that we need to stick with a sans serif for the body
    text. I'd appreciate any help you guys could give me..."
