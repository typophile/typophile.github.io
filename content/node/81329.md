  this seems like some insanely simple kind of default system non-serif font.  To
  make it even more infuriating, it's a font actually used in the identifont.com quiz
  as part of the visual buttons themselves, but I can't tell the quiz to identify
  itself.\r\n\r\nHope someone knows, thanks.  "

    for the response antofa, unfortunately I tried MS sans serif and I don't think
    it's the one.  Comparing the first top image which is 'Microsoft Sans Serif' to
    the lower original one shows differences. The font I'm looking for visually seems
    almost more like a pixel font, but simple."

  body: "Thanks frode frank, here's the strange thing I think, I'm using the exact
    same application in each case.  The app is called ABIX (which is a personal information
    management program) and it has a 'Note' section, which behaves similar to notepad.
    \ \r\n\r\nSo, after writing up a 'Note', I was looking at some text that I had
    written on the screen using this 'Note' feature, when I noticed that the active
    font I could type in (and still can as long as I keep it open) was coincidentally
    the same font that I have been searching for many times before over the years
    (which I first saw on a website for a project called Rustboy).  \r\n\r\nI tried
    to figure out which font on my system was producing this text, by opening a new
    'Note' file within the same application and trying every font on my system using
    the same sentence. But I cannot find any font available within this app that can
    replicate the same result as the original.  How could the same computer (exact
    same hardware), using the same application (exact same software) render the font
    differently?"

    even use shades of grey. I don\u2019t think you would get that kind of difference
    just because of different fonts. I mean, the rendering stays the same throughout
    your system unless the software overrides it. Under Standard greyscale rendering,
    the only thing a font might add is shades of grey. Under Cleartype rendering,
    you\u2019d never get that binary pixel look, not even with a pixel font."
