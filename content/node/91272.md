body: I am just still so much more at home with my illustration program than I am
  with Fontlab or Fontographer.  I pretty much design the whole set of glyphs in Coreldraw
  (shocking, I know) and then bring it into Fontographer.  However, there seems to
  be no easy way to do this in bulk.  That is to say I have to export every single
  glyph as a separate eps file and then import them one at a time.  Tremendously time
  consuming, and not to mention that Fontographer seems to auto-adjust the size of
  the glyphs to whatever it thinks is right, ruining things like x-height and etc.  There
  must be some easier way to do this in this day and age?

  body: "I've been using CorelDraw since version 1, so I'm not shocked in the least.\r\n\r\nFrom
    long (that is, fifteen years' experience), I would recommend using Fontographer
    for EPS import, since it imports EPS at 100% of size all the time, whereas FontLab
    imports at 100% or 99% or 98%, depending on the EPS file. To speed up the export/import
    operation, I generally export five to eight characters at a time. In the A slot,
    I import A B C D E, then I cut B C D E, move onto the next slot, paste, cut, etc.\r\n\r\nIn
    order to ensure that all glyphs import at the same size relative to each other,
    you need to place reference marks above and below the exported groups. IN CorelDraw,
    select each string of characters as you have created them and note the overall
    height of the group. I usually create all uppercase characters on one line, all
    lowercase on another; exclam through at on another; dagger through questiondown
    on another; then incidental characters on a fifth. Taking the largest of these
    measurements, I created a rectangle slightly larger than that measurement, then
    center it on the group of characters which is the tallest. I then break the rectangle
    apart, delete the uprights, then add a third horizontal line at my baseline guideline.
    Combine the three horizontals, copy and snap to the baseline guideline of the
    other groups.  On any given line, copy this object, center it on an export group,
    delete the baseline reference, then duplicate the altered marker for each subsequent
    group.\r\n\r\nSelect the group of letter and the reference marks and Export Selected
    Only. In Fontographer, every character will then import in precise proportion.
    Delete the reference marks just after importing, and you're home free."

  body: "Thanks Old Nick.  This is basically what I do, except for the idea of importing
    a reference shape along with the glyphs, which is BRILLIANT!  However I still
    find this very time consuming.  I wonder if anything could be done with pages?
    \ putting a different glyph on each page in Coreldraw, in some certain preset
    order, and Fontographer will automatically know where the A is and where the L
    is, etc... But I'm probably just dreaming.  Some sort of built in OCR would be
    great too.  Just import your complete glyph set and Fontographer will use OCR
    to decide which glyph to put where.\r\n\r\nI also know that it's possible to create
    a font with Coreldraw only, and since Coreldraw has scripting support, there might
    be some kind of way to automate that, even if only to get a \"transitional\" font
    that will simply be used to ease the loading into Fontographer.\r\n\r\nalso, I
    have to say Fontographer definitely does NOT keep the glyphs at the same size
    for me.  IDK, maybe there is a preference setting somewhere I need to turn off,
    though I did look for one."

  body: "Interesting discussion.\r\n\r\nWhat I would suggest is to export all glyphs
    individually from CorelDRAW (may be thru VBA scripting) then, with the help of
    FontLab scripting (in Python) import each glyph in its slot. This approach also
    calls for some consistent naming convention of glyphs.\r\n\r\nI have got my hands
    dirty in VBA scripting.\r\n\r\nAll scripting gurus in Python are welcome."

  body: "Ryan,\r\n\r\nAll i can say that the process I described has been working
    for me for about fifteen years now. It generally takes me twenty minutes or less
    to import all my glyphs into Fontographer, which also includes setting \u201Cworking\u201D
    sidebearings. After checking off \u201CSelected only\u201D in the CorelDraw Export
    dialogue the first time, the process goes: select items, select Export, hit Enter
    twice, ALT+TAB, ALT+F+M+E in Fontographer, select EPS file and done. It takes
    less time to perform these actions that it does to read them."

  body: Scan Font sounds like a good investment. I don't usually work with Illustrator
    files for fonts, but I was sent one recently to digitize and it was tedious work
    importing characters. I'm getting them in at what appears to be the correct size,
    though they don't necessarily land on the baseline.

  body: "ScanFont will try to figure out what's a character in your Illustrator file,
    partly by OCR, partly by surrounding white space. You can manually override its
    \"decisions\" if you need to. I don't know if there are any limits to the number
    of characters you can have. It doesn't always guess right what letter (or number)
    is what, but it's easy enough to rearrange things once it's in FontLab.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, if you are using Mac OS 10.7 (Lion), it won't run. You'll need to run
    the Windows version in Wine or a virtual machine. (More info here: http://www.fontlab.com/front-page/welcome/mac-os-x-10-7-lion-compatibility/
