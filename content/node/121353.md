  detective fiction, and a typewriter font just feels right. But ITC American Typewriter
  doesn't\u2014too big, not quite low-tech or yesterday enough. \r\n\r\nProblem is,
  as I try and run down other typewriter fonts that might work better, most (for obvious
  technological/historical reasons) don't have an italics variation. I have reluctantly
  concluded I do need to use italics at certain points, and therefore am having an
  even harder time finding the perfect font.\r\n\r\nPlease, can you knowledgeable
  folks throw me some recommendations for fonts that can pass as reasonably reminiscent
  of old-school typewriters, yet depart from that enough to have a proper italics
  variation included? \r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nirrenmann"

    version, I suggest Remington Typewriter, which includes an  Italic designed by
    Frederic Goudy in 1927. \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-remington-typewriter/\r\nThis
    is monospace, just like an old time typewriter.\r\nIf you want a similar old time,
    well made typewriter font, with an italic, that is proportionately spaced we will
    have to look further.\r\nDon"

    with part of the text in Italic it would have been necessary to take the page
    out of the machine and put it in a different typewriter that used an Italic typeface,
    manually align the page and type the Italic portion of the text. Then take the
    page out and return it to the original typewriter to resume typing with the Roman
    typeface.  A painstaking process, to say the least. \r\nThe usual practice for
    making Italic letters was to continue typing the Italic portion with the regular
    Roman typeface, then go back and type over the Italic portion with the underscore
    key.\r\nDon"

    could become tiresome to read quite fast.\r\nIf the typewriter setting is just
    for selected portions of text, I would go for full authenticity and follow Don\u2019s
    advice about underscores instead of italics.\r\nIf all the text is to be equally
    set in the same typeface, I would go for something proportional in width that
    just hints at typewriter style or, maybe better yet, something that reprise the
    style of typefaces used in the old pulp paperbacks (perhaps keeping the monospaced
    typewriter treatment for headings)."

  body: "I read a book once, \"File Under Architecture\" by Herbert Muschamp, that
    was entirely set in typewriter fonts. I don't recall having any trouble or fatigue
    from reading it. In fact it was printed on brown craft paper, sometimes using
    purple ink. Yet I remember it as being very enjoyable to read. I'm not saying
    it's necessarily a good idea to design a book this way (if the book had been dull,
    I might have had a different opinion about its design), but I think it can work.\r\n\r\nTypewriter
    fonts are generally not as beautiful or refined as book typefaces, but most were
    at least designed to be legible, given their limitations. Their main drawback
    is that they are not very space efficient. A book face set poorly (too tight or
    too loose or too small or with too little leading) would probably be worse than
    a typewriter font in terms of reading fatigue.\r\n\r\n(Anecdotal, I know.)"

  body: "I had forgotten about Triplicate Poly [proportional spacing]. Of the suggestions
    so far it is the only one that gives you something of an old typewriter look,
    with Italics, that looks finished rather than distressed. It's seems to have comfortable
    spacing for extended text -- neither too tightly set or too loose -- and might
    work OK for a book length. \r\n\r\nThe mention of old pulps reminds me that many
    of them were set in Plantin. I posted a sample at the end of the following thread:
    http://typophile.com/node/117180\r\n\r\nPlantin would work well in a book that
    used a Roman for much of the text and the typewriter look for some purposes.\r\n\r\nIf
    the typewritten stuff is relatively short, the underscore technique would give
    a real flavor of period authenticity.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"

    isn't a good idea, wasn't used in old detective fiction, and it might make a self-published
    book look amateurish. \r\n\r\nBut it might work well on the cover.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a sample from my father's 1930 edition of The Scarab Murder Case by S.S. Van Dine:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/500_6137.jpg]"

  body: "Typewriter manufacturers did make italic faces for typewriters, even though
    they were not popular - emphasis was done by underlining, or by switching to the
    red side of the ribbon. When the IBM Selectric came along, at least you could
    change typestyles by changing the element.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, before the Selectric,
    there was the Blickensderfer and the Hammond.\r\n\r\nSo a little research will
    turn up quite a few examples. There were even italic faces for the IBM Executive.\r\n\r\nBut
    I presume you're looking not just for the typeface, but for ready-to-use fonts
    in TTF or OTF format, of which I can't recall an example offhand."
