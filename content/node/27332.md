    <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=GTT0000004\">Digitalis</a>
    and noticed it has a certain similar quality to it. Maybe it could also appeal
    to you? If you try the word 'Singapore' in the Flont test drive, you can see (perhaps)
    what I mean.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
