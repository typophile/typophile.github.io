  <BR> <BR>This is a logo for a clothing company targeting African American males
  in thier mid 20s to mid 30s. The concept behind it deals with how society views
  African American males two different ways &#40;a criminal or a professional&#41;
  yet it is still the same person. <BR> <BR>The style is supposed to be a business
  casual &amp; more sophisticated look - moving away from the street styles of Phat
  Farm, Sean John &amp; Rocawear. <BR> <BR>Please give me feedback on the legibility
  &amp; aesthetics of the logo. Thanks <BR> <BR>MTStanford

  body: I will concur with Hrant and Mitchell regarding the joining of the &#34;G&#34;s
    &#40;and I don&#39;t mean &#34;G&#34; in the street slang sense&#41;. Right now
    it looks divided, which kind of contributes to your statement, but I think the
    joining of the &#34;G&#34;s is a stronger statement in relation to your &#34;still
    the same person&#34;, as Mitchell identified. Also, I wonder what small cap &#34;E&#34;s
    would look like &#40;about 70% of the vertical height of the &#34;G&#34;s&#41;.
    It might create a nice implied frame for the word, not to mention an interestingly
    strong shape. <BR> <BR>Aloha, or shall I say &#34;shaka&#34; in this critique

    <BR>If the duality of the mark is going to be part of the  <BR>marketing, then
    Andrew makes a good point. <BR>But if it&#39;s just an unspoken thing, then the
    mirrored approach will work very well, imo. <BR> <BR>What if you tried it with
    some other widths, or even a <BR>monoline, for comparison sake? <BR> <BR>The forms
    seem relatively frail, especially the crossbars of your &#39;e&#39;. <BR> <BR>Also,
    you might be able to get away with lowering the vertical <BR>stems on the G and
    D, just a bit, giving the G more legibility. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>

    one. I&#39;d either go for a full overlap, or leave a space.  <BR> <BR>BTW today
    I&#39;m working on a project that requires I be drawing with a pencil, hence the
    sketching. These may be less edgy and more classy, but do with them what you will.
    &#40;Also note your D and G shouldn&#39;t be actual mirrors of each other. It
    will be more like the modulation of a rotated D with the structure of a mirrored
    D. Make sense?&#41; <BR> <BR>R <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25836.gif"

    <BR> <BR>Anyway - someone on another forum suggested this:  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25853.gif"
    alt="both"> <BR> <BR>I think you all may be missing the point of why the D &amp;
    the G are reflected. The &#34;EDGE&#34; is supposed to be in the middle of those
    two letters. When you combine those two letters first of all, it looks too much
    like the gucci logo - but more importantly, it looses the whole concept behind
    it. But I think this one addresses the issue of it being very similar but still
    different to the point where its not just a mirrored image.'

    <BR> <BR>Oh, then I think you need to mark it somehow, like maybe shear the curves
