  been lurking for quite some time and seek advice. Hopefully I will get more involved
  in the community as time passes.\r\n\r\nPardon my lack of technical terms, but I
  will do my best to explain a font that I am looking for. Small caps, not too prominent
  serifs, narrow, tall, and powerful. I realize this is as vague as can be, but I
  am designing the logo for an Investment Banking club and seek any feedback. Something
  that commands reverence and respect, perhaps even a little elitist.\r\n\r\nI've
  dabbled in type a little bit, but really don't have the eye for nor the arsenal
  of fonts that I once (if ever) had. Paid fonts, free fonts are great. I have some
  discretionary funds.\r\n\r\nOnce again, any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    small caps, perhaps Filosofia's Grand Caps:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/filosofia/grand-scaps/\r\n\r\nAnd
    by 'not too prominent serifs,' do you possibly mean without serifs?"

    could imagine something with short but sturdy serifs... high-class but \xABreliable\xBB.\r\nDunno,

  body: "Thank you for the replies. I browsed through some of the other posts and
    came across some fonts that give off a luxury feel. Serlio has a nice feel to
    it, so I might go with that.. although a lot of the recommendations here are great.\r\n\r\nBy
    \"not too prominent serifs\" I meant that yes, serifs are great, but not over-exaggerated.
    I know that my wording is off, but I feel you get the point.\r\n\r\nI'll browse
    through some of these and see what i come up with. Thank you so much."

  body: "<cite>\"Serlio has a nice feel to it\"</cite>\r\n\r\nThat feels very classic,
    exclusive and \xABrich\xBB to me.\r\nIt's an interesting question if financial
    institutions these days should still be clothing themselves in such gold and brocade,
    if you know what I mean. \r\nI personally might be looking for elegant but robust
    trustworthiness rather than golden faucets. \r\nI'm not saying I'm right, and
    after all I don't know your client; what I'm trying to get at is that there's
    a whole lot of psychology going on under the surface here, and the selection of
    a typeface really ends up bearing a lot more meaning beyond \xABfeeling nice\xBB."
