    is something I don't know anything about. How/where is it marked copyright? And
    can't it be free to use when it is copyright? How do you change a license?"

    purpose. I don't need credit either, but don't want them as public domain, and
    I don't want other websites to distribute them.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I get out
    of it is Google Adsense traffic at *my* site which pays for some equipment.\r\n\r\nOne
    site I found had pasted my table code (complete to links of the hi-res files on
    my host's server) and thumnails into their pages, as if they had taken the photos,
    and I was being dinged for the bandwidth.  Thankfully, they did desist when asked.

    Creative Commons license as options. Also Flickr doesn't offer an option to give
    an image completely into the public domain.
