  line up. They want an approachable, modern look but to keep in mind that they are
  still connected to the federal government (see gartner, input etc...). I couldn't
  find a typeface I was 100% happy with or could afford so I've tried to create my
  own. I'm looking for feedback on two things 1) how to improve the type, make it
  more distinct and weight you think works better and 2) Should I go with a wordmark
  or use the logo. The idea behind the logo is the have a win, manage, market philosophy
  that when used brings you back to winning a new contract and starting the cycle
  again, hence three parts that make up the circle.\r\n\r\nHave at it.. Thanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CustomType_6350.gif]"

    similar to Grant Thornton's, let's just stay with the wordmark instead. :-)"

  body: Yeah, that (grant thornton) looks pretty close. damn. Any ideas on making
    the wordmark seem more like a logo and less like text?

  body: Don't worry, forget the logo similarities. It's hard to be authentic and original
    except you're living in the era where Da Vinci still alive. Don't get stuck. Good
    luck. :)
