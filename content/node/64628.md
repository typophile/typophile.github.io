  would be the right sort of place to come and ask for some help.\r\n\r\nI remember
  reading a very interesting piece on some new ligatures that someone had designed,
  including a very clever 'ing' ligature consisting of a lowercase n with a dot over
  the stem and a loop attached to the right of the character.\r\n\r\nAs this was a
  year or so ago, it may well be a long shot, but if anyone knows where I can find
  this article again it would be a massive help!"

    but that made for a very interesting and amusing read!\r\nI'll definitely be having
    a look at these, they are going to be very good inspiration for the project that
    I am working on."
