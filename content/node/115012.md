  body: At first I thought this might be one of the several Bodoni italics without
    a serif on the bottom of the C. But then the upper part of that C makes me think
    that this is just a manually slanted roman - which could put this into the hundreds
    of Century-style fonts. Add to that the very different lower part of the two low-res
    G's. Yikes ... I'm afraid I give up, Tom.

  body: This looks a lot like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/linotype-didot/italic/">Didot
    Italic</a> to me. Or at least something quite similar.

  body: "I agree Tylor that a Didot Italic is probable, particularly since Didot is
    almost a French national champion in typefaces. No maudit anglais fonts like Times
    Roman for \"get to France.\" \r\nDon"
