  body: "Similar to Propane is Infinity by Thirstype, but I think Apex Sans would
    be a much better choice, especially for what is probably a long proposal. It's
    more \"professional\" than Infinity, but still has the contemporary feel I think
    you want. It is possible that I see Apex Sans as architecty due to it's use by
    thirst in a series of posters for IIT's series of lectures on architecture. I
    stole (uh, aquisitioned?) one of them and hung it over my desk so I could gaze
    at it. So my vote is for Apex Sans.\r\n\r\n<a href= \"http://www.idonline.com/adr01/iit.asp\">small
    examples</a>\r\n<a href= \"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/interviews/images/iit_poster.gif\">another
    one</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsn't it funny how we use ambiguous words like professional
    and contemporary and expect that we know what the other means? Because I don't
    even know what I mean by them."

    is in the same sort of space as Section, and very stylish. The display versions
    are a bit weird, but the text versions might work for you.\r\n\r\nMore self-conscious
    but very well done is <a href=\"http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=84\">Cholla</a>,
    which I saw used here in Washington DC at the Hirschhorn Gallery. Also a bit along
    the self-conscious line, but which I like better is <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude\">Amplitude</a>,
    which, like Simian is by Christian Schwartz.    \r\n\r\nJeremy Tankard's <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/aspect.htm\">Aspect</a>
    is both both architectural and avant-garde.\r\n\r\nIf you like stuff that is somehow

    It is part of a very comprehensive family, including two serifs, condensed, alternates
    and even a monospaced face, making it great for a rich identity.

    about the intricacies of type, tell him to: see/use this thread; and to seriously
    consider what I think will work really well for you: AF-Generation by Dirk Wachowiak.
    It goes from round to sharp and light to dark and IIRC narrow to wide - so you
    can choose exactly what you need, and maybe even mix them depending on things
    like size, background etc. It's really a uniquely versatile design.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontfactory.com/search.php?search=1&mode=0&search_text=generation&x=0&y=0\r\n\r\nhttp://www.acmefonts.net/\r\n\r\nBTW,
