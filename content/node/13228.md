  am having a very hard time trying to identify the font type used on my company website.
  We are making some changes/updates and the original web design company, in a display
  of sour grapes, is not telling us what font this is, because they want to do all
  the updating work.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.energyottawa.com/_images/english/inside/green/t_green_generation.gif\">Click
  here for a sample</a> or <a href=\"http://www.energyottawa.com/green_power/index.cfm?dsp=template&act=view3&template_id=46&lang=e\">
  Click here for the full website</a>\r\n\r\nAny help anybody can provide in identifying
  this font would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Very close... the numbers (specifically 4) is different and the M is a bit
    more condensed... other then that though its very accurate... I don't think you'd
    be able to tell much difference.

      have the accents/special characters used in languages like french.\r\n\r\nI
      kinda need those, any idea where/if I can get those for a similar font?"
