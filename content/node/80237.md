body: "This logo was developed recently and it has been unusually difficult trying
  to get an answer out of the brand agency as to what font(s) make up the logo they
  have developed. I have tried to match up a font but so far unsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nIt
  would be great if anyone could help me id the font in this logo so we can build
  some new creative inline with the logo design.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLuke\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ssnt-alt-logo-highres-jpeg_3854.jpg]"
