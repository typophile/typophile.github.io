<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
I'm setting a four-language text in InDesign that runs in English, French, German and Japanese columns across the page.
This thread http://typophile.com/node/12477 that Chris started last year was very helpful and I now have all the Japanese copy inserted correctly into the InDesign document, nicely set in Hiragino Mincho Pro.
My question is this (and it may be more a question about Japanese than about Japanese type): I get the feeling that line breaks occur both in the middle of some compound kanji and also in the middle of some strings of kana (especially verb endings); is this acceptable for Japanese readers? Or are kanji compounds never supposed to break across lines? (And, if so, is there a helpful setting somewhere in InDesign to say "don't break compound kanji across lines"?)
I've attached a pic from the InDesign file as an example. The example is from the instructions to a modern music score, and comprises two paragraphs. The break from the third to the fourth lines (in the first paragraph) breaks the verb ending "teiru" into "te-iru". Likewise, I think that the break between the second and third lines (in the second paragraph) may split a two-character kanji compound onto separate lines.
Are line breaks like this problemmatic for native Japanese readers?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I may have answered the questions above with some more googling. The FAQ http://www.opticentre.net/FAQ/Languages/Japanese-line-breaks/ makes it look like line-breaking is, in fact, a concern, as I was guessing above.
Fortunately, however, the PDF www.techart.com/downloads/ID&WL-Part2.pdf here written by Diane Burns points to a magic InDesign template available here http://www.techart.com/downloads/, which downloaded and loaded into InDesign quite easily.
Applying Diane's j-bodytext paragraph style to my Japanese text produces the output given in the attachment. This new output looks great to my eyes because I don't see much (or any) split strings of kana or split strings of kanji.
But I'm not a native speaker. I would love it if somebody could confirm that the new text flow with Diane's paragraph style will satisfy a native speaker.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fixed-flow_3772.png]</div>
