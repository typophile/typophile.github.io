    Garamond Premier]] seems very close, at least for the caps. \r\n\r\nThe italic
    is another story. That doesn't look like any Garamond, so I think they mixed fonts.\r\n\r\n-

    version of Garamond that wasn't close as that one. Cheers!\r\n\r\nThe italic is
    a tricky one, it's stumped me."

  body: "I have often complained about italics as being especially hard to ID because
    most sites show the Roman face until you burrow down into each family. I think
    FontShop is one exception that shows all faces that meet the search condition.\r\n\r\nThis
    is one time when a book is better than most web sites. I thought about having
    a Serif  & Sans Italics Guide, but I don't think I can handle another Guide right
    now.\r\n\r\n- Mike"
