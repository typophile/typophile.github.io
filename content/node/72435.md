  made?

  body: Thanks! I'm still not sure what the connection is, if any, with what we associate
    with that time period...the closest I saw was the "Karako", but when I searched
    it, nothing doing. I'll try google, some more...

  body: "I don't see the connection myself.  The Basque lettering is instantly recognizable
    as such.  A bold but solemn celtic/roman style mishmash.   The 60s were all about
    flash and pizzazz right?  (Okay, okay, I'm not old enough to have lived through
    that era).  More seriously: maybe it's just a subconscious relating of the fight
    the system hippie movements with the independent nature of the Basque Country.\r\n\r\nSidenote:
    Euskadi means Basque Country, euskara is just the language \u2014 the picture
    on the link geraintf posted is decidedly Spanish (language)"
