  book designed in Quark\u2026 everything looks fine, but when saved as a PDF something
  strange happens: the space between some characters (specially all uppercase words)
  goes crazy, stretching its self\u2026\r\nThe typography that my friend is using
  is fairly new\u2026 so I don\u2019t know if the problem might come from the font
  itself, or maybe is a PDF thing.\r\n\r\nAny one has an answer?\r\n\r\n(The typeface
  is Enrico) \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: "It's been an age since I've used QuarkXPress, but... I don't imagine things
    have changed very much with QXP, but the application never really seemed to be
    happy making PDFs. I dimly remember having to generate PostScript (PS) files of
    documents, then RIPping those through Acrobat Distiller, all because the PDFs
    XPress made directly were totally crazy.\r\n\r\nIf you are working in OS X, can
    you choose \"Print\" and then select the OS-level \"PDF/Save as PDF...\" command?
    Any improvement?"

  body: "My experience with Quark is similar to Chester's. One question. Was your
    all caps wording done using the Caps style or is it typed as all caps? Quarks
    \"Styles\" can be, well, quirky. This can be magnified to awful if you adjust
    tracking.  It can look fine in Quark but somehow in the transition to PDF, things
    don't marry up well. This is one of my reasons for dumping Quark but that won't
    help your friend.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
