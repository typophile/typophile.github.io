		<div class="commentbody">It's an interesting exhibit, but unfortunately the web site photos are not pictures of signage used. Maybe the home page was supposed to be, and that looked like Franklin Gothic to me. No doubt materials in the museum would show the sort of signs you are asking about, but that web site wasn't much help, from the portions I saw. <BR> <BR>As Tim noted, there was probably no unified typography associated with Apartheid, although I also guess that like most governments, there was a government printing office that was responsible for official signs. But this is a guess. It could just as easily have been left to the towns and cities to provide their own signs, for all I know. <BR> <BR>Natalie, if you can provide samples, we could see if we could ID them. Remember that many of the signs would probably have been made without the use of computers, if they were made before the mid-80's.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike - you are right. I only checked it for images after I posted. Sorry &hellip; <BR> <BR>I lived there for a while - before and after the regime died. I cannot remember seeing a 'corporate style' face for apartheid related communication. <BR> <BR>It was so much a part of the culture that signs were not all issued by the government - you could buy them. <BR> <BR>I can talk to some South African friends and see if I can learn more about this for you. In fact, my father-in-law was in the building trades back in the day - he would know about signage and way finding systems. I will ask him next time we call. <BR> <BR>Mike</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all so much. I'm afraid I don't have any examples but was encouraged by my tutor to find if there was a corporate face. All I came accross was the government website style guide which allowed for Helvetica, Arial and Verdana. But this is only for the website unfortunately&hellip; I'll see if I can find samples.</div>
