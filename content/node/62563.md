  is on the future of type design and it's lucrative value in today's economy (and
  technology). Now with the advent of torrents and being able to steal entire packages
  of fonts, where do you see this taking type designers?\r\n\r\nI personally can't
  decide if it is a good or bad thing. Much like the music industry it seems good
  in that it only keeps those who have a real passion for it in the field, yet my
  other side thinks that if anyone is to design real top quality faces, compensation
  would be required.\r\n\r\nI realize this may have been posted before and I'm sorry
  if it has. I'm still just a student so I do not know much about this matter right
  now.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n-patrick"

    have been getting ripped off since the fifteenth century. The only difference
    now is that the users steal the fonts instead of buying stolen designs from type
    vendors.\r\n\r\n<cite>Much like the music industry it seems good in that it only

    your hands, because you pulled that nonsense out of your ass. The notion that
    piracy is doing the music industry any good is rubbish. Most truly independent
    musicians are still waiting tables to pay rent, the independent labels still aren\u2019t,
    and corporate crap still dominates even if it sells far less than it used too.
    The only people making money off piracy are mainstream acts that use it to decrease
    their marketing costs."

    has increased the volume in the market. Alas the producers output likely outpaces
    the consumers ability to consume it so there's an overall lessening of the value
    of individual units. Granted, it's also cheaper to produce the units.\r\n\r\nCopying
    of IP law protected material has always been around, always will be. "

    fond of thinking about single fonts sales as chumming for the big fish. Like the
    one we landed recently. Some of our fonts will be on some company's cell phones
    soon, if not sooner. I can't say more."

  body: "There are many ways to make money from making fonts, and the internet, for
    all its faults and the downside of piracy etc., is still responsible for creating
    a font industry where independent type designers can make a living, which is quite
    remarkable, historically.\r\n\r\nBTW, I don't see much similarity with the music
    business, and digital piracy existed before the internet."
