  working on a font that contains Oldstyle tabular, proportinal figures and Lining
  tabular, proportinal figures, what numbers should be included with the SmallCaps
  glyphs. \r\n\r\nShould there be SmallCap Oldstyle tabular, proportinal and SmallCap
  Lining tabular, proportinal figures ?"

  body: "IMO, \"smcp\" should not change figures from the U&lc text default, because
    small caps will most often be used in concert with U&lc.\r\n\r\nHowever, for \"c2sc\",
    which is activated as part of \"all small caps\", then small-cap-height lining
    figures are appropriate. It's extremely unlikely that such a style would be used
    in a tabular-figure setting, so only one set of figures, proprotional and kerned
    (really only between 7 and 4) is necessary."
