  body: The roman font appears to be Carolus, an older phototype display face. There
    doesn&#39;t appear to be a commercial version of it available in digital format,
    but if you Google &#34;carolus font&#34; you will find links to various free versions.

  body: Carolus Roman &#40;credited to Oldstyle&#41; was one of the fonts on the old
    Image Club Letterpress CD&#39;s up through version 6.0 &#40;before Adobe acquired
    them&#41;. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the &#39;free&#39; versions around originated
    there. Agfa, who now owns Image Club&#39;s collection, no longer includes Carolus
    Roman in the Image Club fonts.
