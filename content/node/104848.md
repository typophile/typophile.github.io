  body: Can't recognize this one (and don't know Travian either). As alternative,
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/jupiter-pro|Jupiter Pro]] using some
    stylistic alternates (/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/jupiter-pro/pro/glyphs.html#glyphs/434144/153|N]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/jupiter-pro/pro/glyphs.html#glyphs/434144/280|V]]
    and /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/jupiter-pro/pro/glyphs.html#glyphs/434144/207|R]])
    would do the job quite nicely.
