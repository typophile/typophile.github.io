  a typed piece of paper (see pic attached) that from my initial research seems to
  have been a font used on an old Corona manual typewriter.\r\n\r\nI've been trying
  to confirm this, but more importantly, also determine approximately in what year
  (or range of years) could this piece of paper been typed.\r\n\r\nWould you be able
  to help me with this, or perhaps re-direct me to someone who could?\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your consideration.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDoug\r\nToronto, Canada\r\nbadger@milsurps.com\r\n"

  body: "There is a group of folks called Forensic Document Examiners, and they use
    a software program that helps them identify almost any typewriter font ever made.
    I can't recall the name of the program, but if you contact their Society (Google
    should find it), they ought to be able to tell you who can help.\r\n\r\n- Mike
