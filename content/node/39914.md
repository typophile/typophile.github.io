  body: "A few points I'd raise are:\r\n\r\n- You seem to be lacking a lot of ligatures,
    if not all of them. I especially see a lack of fi-ligatures.\r\n\r\n- Try to use
    text figures, especially in the main body.\r\n\r\n- I think you mean \u2018Foreword\u2019
    not \u2018Foreward\u2019\r\n\r\n- To me the typeface looks like it could really
    use the good, old slanted hyphen, instead of the straight one it\u2019s maker
    has provided it. Try replacing the hyphens with some nicer ones. I'd suggest something
    like Adobe Jenson Pro.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit pressed for time right now, so I may come
    back with more once I get a chance to look more closely at it..."

    that came with Coreldraw, so I\u2019ll have to add them manually. Opentype has
    really spoiled me.\r\n\r\nGood catch on \u201Cforeward.\u201D My professor supplied
    the contents text, so I never really noticed the error.\r\n\r\nAs for the hyphens,
    they are slanted. Maybe it\u2019s just not so noticeable onscreen."

  body: "A few thoughts:\r\n\r\n- I wonder if the grid is dramatic enough. \r\n- The
    artwork is beautiful but in so many instance so tiny.\r\n- The opening title and
    half-title pages seem to lack something. (A more dramatic grid could help.) The
    location of the image for instance on the opening spread seems mechanical.\r\n-
    In the opening you use a condensed sans and then when the text starts you aren't.\r\n-
    Could there be more scale in the text? \r\n- The use of a drop cap mid-body seems
    out of place. If you use a drop cap I'd think one would appear at the beginning
    as well. Or, if it does signal a different kind of text, then the text at the
    beginning should be treated differently.\r\n\r\nGreat material to use. But I think
    you need more spice.\r\n\r\nI hope I haven't been too harsh. I mean everything
    only as crit."

  body: "The grid (and the whole piece) is intentionally dull. I wanted to do a big
    publication project that felt more conservative and didn\u2019t have gigantic
    headlines, pull-quotes, and images bursting out all over the place (as I usually
    tend to do). I also felt that understated typography might allow the intense images
    to pop out more, but I probably need to up the scale to make that work better.\r\n\r\nI
    did fix the sans type on the intro page. As for the drop caps, I left it out of
    the chapter opener because I felt like there was already a lot happening on that
    page.  "

    dull. It doesn't have to be dull to be conservative. \r\n\r\nI wasn't suggesting
    massive headlines, and maybe you don't need to play with size contrast, but the
    spreads need something. \r\n\r\nIt is ok not to use the drop cap on the opening
    paragraph if each chapter were to have an opening paragraph that sort of set up
    what followed. It just needs to be treated differently. I think so anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    much of the above, I must say that the overall aesthetic (grid included) is very
    attractive. I hope you will post the final draft with whatever revisions you include.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck on your final. I remember the days...\r\n\r\nRay\r\n\r\nP.S. I say \"I remember
    the days,\" but I was a music major, not a design major. I did not discover typography
    as an art for myself until well after I graduated (which wasn't that long ago).
    To you it might be another drag of a class, but you're lucky to get training like
    this in school!"

  body: "Does the body typeface you are using have non-aligning numbers and small
    caps? Check for old style figures, its just those dates look so big in body text,
    as do the abbreviations.\r\n\r\nAbreviations and dates like 1967 often appear
    to big when set in body text. Thats why we use small caps for abbreviation like
    : JFK plus. \r\nNumbers like 1967 also look big. Good typefaces take care of this
    by using non-aligning numbers, much like our good friend Georgia here."

  body: "Oh and I understand where you are coming from on the books aesthetic. I think
    you have worded it wrong though \u2013 try explaining to a client that you made
    it deliberately dull (not a good move). What you might want to say is that the
    typography has been pushed more into the background thus to make the artwork the
    hero. The book honors the artist and not the designer and thus is designed for
    legibility. Contrary to Miss Tiffany I think this is perfectly fine, most of the
    time books are designed very conservatively because the focus is more on the content.
    However I do think that you could be using your grid better, and could be using
    your hierarchy better if this is indeed your goal. Keep working at it  : fall
    down seven times stand up eight. "

    there, but if I don\u2019t do <em>something</em> over the top I\u2019ll get marked

    of the professors cannot even begin to comprehend the idea that student might
    want to make something look good and functional as opposed to going balls-to-the-wall
    on every project. For example, I guarantee you that no matter how good this looks
    in the end, it will not get above a B because there aren\u2019t any pull quotes,
    which my professors always want to see tacked all over everything, appropriate
    or not. It\u2019s very frustrating."

  body: "James, if it were me I would go to a decent art bookstore and hang around
    for as long as the staff will let you, flipping thru art books and taking note
    of layouts and design. You'll encounter more usable ideas there in the same amount
    of time as posting at typophile. Don't be afraid to borrow as long as borrowing
    is not the only thing you do.\r\n\r\nI would use a bit more leading in the main
    body; replace the dropped cap with a decorative cap (any decorative font that
    goes with the material and Iowan Old Style); do the TOC and picture captions in
    Iowan smallcaps; half-title and title pages in Iowan smallcaps; use hanging figures
    where appropriate (main body copy for example); use italics for inline quotes.\r\n\r\nHow
    about some rubrication? It needn't be red. Try other colors, blue, cyan, orange.
    Rubrication makes a good alternative to pull quotes if you're averse to those.\r\n\r\nIowan
    titling font has some nice ornaments you could use as embellishments to spice
    things up.\r\n\r\nYes the manuscript has some serious problems which need to be
    rectified before your typography can make it \"sing\". The whole thing is overwrought,
    and the author can't handle an apostrophe, eg: <strong>Louis's oeuvre</strong>
    should be <strong>Louis' oeuvre</strong>. <strong>Joan Mira</strong> probably
    should be <strong>Joan Miro</strong>. Quite a few of the hyphens should be emdashes.
    Convoluted run-on sentences make it a cumbersome read. \"Infused with a diaphanous
    jubilation,\" no, sorry, that's pure wankshaft, too desperate to be effective.\r\n\r\n<em>non-aligning

  body: "I second much of what Tiffany said (and sorry not to chime in sooner, I only
    just noticed this thread).\r\n\r\nType aside, I think you are short-changing the
    art by having it adhere so rigidly to the grid. Those pictures need to sing. There's
    nothing wrong with having one grid for the text and then letting your margins
    out for the images. His work is massive in scale, and in your book you get no
    sense of that, except for the chapter opener. I don't see the purpose of all that
    dead white space on the outer margin. Don't think the two pix work side by side
    on the last spread.\r\n\r\nNow the design/typography. I haven't given it the sort
    of close read the others have, here are a few comments in no particular order.\r\n\r\nHalf
    title and title: The type looks very cramped, especially the title page. Also,
    \ you never really would use the same image for both.\r\n\r\nContents page: you
    don't need to list \"contents\" on the contents page. Also it's Foreword (I see
    someone else pointed that out) and Acknowledgments (no e after the g). I'm also
    not sure why you guttered the art here. Remember that you're dealing with an actual
    book here, not spreads on a computer. While it's quite common to run art across
    the gutter, I can't see why you did it here.\r\n\r\nChapter opener: I don't think
    the various elements hang together all that well. I'd also make the chapter title
    consistent with the type on the title page. I'm not wild about the condensed type
    on the title page but if you're set on it, I think you should use it here too.\r\n\r\nDrop
    caps: I agree with Tiffany that they are distracting. Consider another device
    for the text breaks like a leadin, that you can also use for the opening paragraph.\r\n\r\nPage
    14: not sure what the image is lining up with here. Either align the image or
    the caption with the text in the opposite column.\r\n\r\nAnd I just realized I
    am way too late on this - you have probably already gotten your crit. Oh well,
    I already wrote it so here you go."
