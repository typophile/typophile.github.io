    I'm new here. \r\n\r\nAlthout in the other post they are discussing another typeface.
    I was asking for the typeface that he used on the body text. Thank you anyway."

    but from them I can only tell that the display type in the book is the same as
    the one on the website.\r\n\r\nScanning or taking a picture of the body text would
    help."
