    you get out of a maltreated Geometric Slabserif 703 Bold Condensed (a Bitstream
    clone of <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1224/memphis-family.html\">Memphis</a>\u2014the
    original has no condensed weights afaik), skewed (as there is no <em>condensed</em>
    italic with the clone either) and squooshed. The dot has yet to be rounded \u2026\r\n;^)"

  body: "Florian -\r\n\r\nStaggeringly close.  Thank you.  I'm amazed you identified
    this so quickly.  Feel like I've just witnessed some Kreskin-like feat.\r\n\r\nThe
    sample version does, however, have enough distinctions to warrant your \"maltreated\"
    observation.  Specifically:\r\n\r\noverall thickness,\r\nskew,\r\nround versus
    square dot over the \"i,\" and \r\nthe comma - in the sample, the comma is notched,
    where in the Geometric Slabserif, it's a simple parallelogram.\r\n\r\nEven more
    picky, I notice now the serif on the bottom of the \"s\" rises just a bit higher
    than in the sample.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMy question, then, which is more likely: there's
    a standard font that fits the sample more closely or someone at the mag would
    have gone to the trouble to customise the font for a particular layout? \r\n\r\nAgain,
    thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scomma_6564.jpg]"

  body: "Hi LEPhont,\r\nit wasn\u2019t my intention to claim that your sample really
    was a maltreated Geometric Slabserif\u2014I only tried to make a joke, as I found
    no better match for it. Sorry for the confusion."

  body: "Thank you both.  They're both very close and a launching point for me to
    move forward.\r\nGiven the age of the original, it may be unlikely I'll find the
    exact one -- do fonts ever just drop off the \"grid?\"\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks."
