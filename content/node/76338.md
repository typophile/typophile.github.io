body: I am a high school teacher and adviser for our yearbook.  The students really
  want to use Neutraface this year, but we really can't afford to buy it!  I will
  not pirate fonts as that presents a bad example to my students.  Can anyone recommend
  a font that is similar that would be cheap (or even free?)  Thank you for your help!

    1930.\r\nBut probably not \"clean\" enough in comparison to Neutraface or Lionel."
