  legibility. Its basically type placed in different situations. The book has a wide
  dimension and I believe the cover is in black. (very old book...60s maybe)\r\n\r\nHere
  is one page from the book.\r\nhttp://prakashnair.com/secret/1.jpg\r\n"

  body: "It's called 'Compendium for Literates A System of Writing by Karl Gerstner'
    published in 1972. English edition 74. I have the paperback version in fair condition,
    the cover is however falling off. Last week I recieved from a bookshop in the
    states the hardback edition which they stated was in good order. I don't know
    the name for the style of binding but Compendium for Literates features pages
    that are folded in half to create the two sides of each page, so the book is twice
    the thickness with as many sides blank as are printed. Anyhow in the hardback
    they sent a previous owner had seporated each fold, so turn a page and you get
    two empty pages. I wasn't happy and have request to send it back but as yet no
    response. If they don't offer a refund I'll be putting it on ebay with this clearly
    mentioned plus pictures. Perhaps hard to believe but I am a little obsesed with
    Karl Gerstner and truely did recieve it only last week. German edition was reprinted
    in 2000 or 2002 I can't recall but is for sale new on ebay and I believe amazon.\r\n\r\nThe
    cover is black, it's near square at roughly 6\"x6\" by 1\" thick and is read by
    turning the pages up with the spine away from you. Published by MIT\r\n\r\nA very
    good book, five chapters; Language and Writing, Craft, Picture, Function, Expression.
    Gerstner has tried to exhaustivly illustrate the ways in which words can be presented
    on a page. Hugely conservative by todays standards but still relevant.\r\n\r\nhttp://cgi.ebay.co.uk/KARL-GERSTNER-typography-swiss-graphic-design-import_W0QQitemZ4570687296QQcategoryZ378QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem\r\n\r\nHope
    this has helped."
