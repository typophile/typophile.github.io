  body: Before I talk about the sources &#40;they come from different ones&#41; I
    like to hear some opinions. <BR> <BR>They are drawn as a initials for a script
    face. But I have some reason to reject it from this project.  <BR> <BR>The concept
    was not to add historical true &#34;14th&#34; initals, but initials look a like.
    I dropped away all the floral, pictural &amp; oranmental stuff.

  body: In some of the characters, if they are in fact authentic, they seem derivative
    from the Art Nouveau, and in some instances William Morris. I suppose what comes
    around goes around and perhaps that might be my eyes seeing them in that way.
    However...

  body: Thank you Tiffany, <BR> <BR>but I`m more interested in getting feed back about
    the current design. <BR> <BR>It`s cash or trash? ;-&#41;

  body: In general, Andreas, I think they do have the correct flavor. I think they
    need some spacing work. I&#39;d say that all of the &#34;boxes&#34; need to be
    the same dimension. They feel hand-drawn, which is nice, not overly type-ified.
    No. I wouldn&#39;t call them trash. I think they have potential. <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: 1 point for cash, thanx Tiffany. <BR> <BR>To the spacing issue, him, I only
    had a single glyph usage in mind, like initials truly designed for. You can set
    words too, but then you get the &#34;Art Nouveau&#34; feeling.  <BR> <BR>Someone
    said to me, &#34;It`s worse enough for a t-shirt.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Hope some other
    readers have opinions too, so please punish me! ;-&#41;

    date&#34; <BR> <BR>The V and W dosent really fit in the style, I would say. <BR>
    <BR>But all together - go on <BR>But i guess there not many who want to use it
    because of the reason I typed above <BR> <BR>greets

  body: Yep, like some others glyphs too. The problem is, you don`t find a V / U other
    than the roman capital in this time. <BR> <BR>So the project is now canceled.

    for initials or for ornamental initials? <BR> <BR>Greets

  body: 'Yes, Schade. But why develop/release a dead thing? The font is ready like
    on the sample.  <BR> <BR>Sources, J.J.G.Alexander have written some nice books
    about medieval typo &amp; art. His work is available in german and english too.
    <BR> <BR>For ornamental stuff have a look for old specimen books around 1900,
    and earlier. For true native stuff you have to study old handwirtten scripts. '
