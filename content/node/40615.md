body: "Pitching this little sucker to a homeless shelter manager next week. \r\n\r\nThe
  building is new and very modern. Opening in March and causing a lot of controversy
  in the city. The person briefing us is very open to a different outlook on shelter
  branding. The shelter is more of a schooling/get back on your feet/change your life
  centre. I've stayed well away from the roofs/doorways/hearts used in pretty much
  all other shelter branding. The logo is aimed more at council members, business'
  and press than the actual homeless. \r\n\r\nThe building is split into 5 coloured
  sections which have been used in the kada font. The idea behind the actual logo
  is the spark and energy of inspiration and change that the people can make for themselves.
  Also changing the fabric of our lives could be used (Afterthought?!). The 'LIGHT\"
  in variable worked better un-aligned due to the round edge of kada.\r\n\r\nThis
  is the first time I have posted any work on here so all comments/abuse would be
  great...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ARC_4846.jpg]"

  body: "OMG TOO MUCH COLOR AND DETAIL THAT WILL NEVER WORK IN BLACK AND WHITE AND
    SMALL SIZES AND...oh...wait...hey, it looks pretty good small and black and white!
    Nice.\r\n\r\nAt first it seems a bit too trendy, but after considering it, it's
    fresh and I'd say unique...especially given the context of both the entity that
    will be using it an the architecture.\r\n\r\nWhen you're given the benefit of
    having great architecture, that, itself, really becomes the predominant brand
    element, so I think your approach makes perfect sense...embrace the architecture.\r\n\r\nI
    like the type and that it's a mask. Perhaps this colored lines are the primary
    imagery, but the logo seems well suited for some flexibility by being able to
    swap out different images to mask as the need arises.\r\n\r\nThe type is solid
    too...you might get away with not having to use the lined background in the small
    sizes. "

  body: "Thanks for the comments aluminum.\r\n\r\nThe building is very modern and
    the guy we're pitching to used to be in the music industry and is therefore deemed
    pretty 'out there' so hopefully he will be open to this. I produced the lines
    using a spirograph effect and think I could get some really nice funky crops for
    certain parts of the building interior.\r\n\r\nThanks again!!"

  body: "I like the placement of \"LIGHT\" very much.\r\nCheck out the lines in the
    pattern, especially visible in the white on black version, see how the \"A\" get
    a lot more lines on the right compared to the amount of lines to the left in the
    \"C\". Maybe move the pattern a bit to the right? I'm shure you allready tried
    that ...\r\nUnusual logo in a very positive way, nice work!"

  body: "I like it.\r\n\r\nThe colours seem to be arbitrarily applied to the various
    lines inside the logo. This is fine if you're going for a noisy random look, but
    I'd try one with a little more order to the colours to see what it looks like.\r\n\r\nGood
    job :-)\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Looks like something for a modern art museum. The crazy wavy lines don't really
    give an impression of "change your life"; more "everything's a bit nuts and random".
    But I still kinda like it, just not for the use you need it for!
