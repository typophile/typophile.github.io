  as part of one of the panels) that had been created to promo a font release. it
  featured an old couple, and made little sense. i can't remember for the life of
  me who showed it, can anyone help me out? i'll even buy you a brew at typecon 09
  :)\r\n\r\n-jonno\r\n"

  body: I've got a run-down of the videos shown at <a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/atypi%E2%80%9908-the-old-and-the-new/">ATypI08</a>
    on <a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/atypi08-typophile-film-fest-4/">The FontFeed</a>,
    but I don't know if the program was the same. Check the list, maybe you'll recognise
    it?

  body: Typophile Film Fest didn't run at TypeCon last year. So the video in question
    would not necessarily have been part of the Fest at ATypI.
