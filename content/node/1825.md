  body: 'A few things to consider: <BR> <BR>First of all, was there a contract? Doesn&#39;t
    sound like it. Does the invoice state a late-fee policy? I hope so. Late fees
    are important for two reasons: 1&#41; It motivates the client to pay on time,
    and 2&#41; it helps you keep the matter professional and allays some of the resentment
    you naturally feel &#40;since the later they are, the more money you ultimately
    get&#41;. <BR> <BR>I would <i>not</i> post a snarky message on their website;
    that reflects poorly on you as a professional. As pissed off as you &#40;understandably&#41;
    are, you won&#39;t regret behaving professionally -- and you might well regret
    throwing the tantrum you&#39;d like to throw.  <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t have
    a contract or a late fee to enforce, you might start by sending them a letter
    &#40;does the UK post have some option for confirming receipt of the letter?&#41;
    stating how many days overdue the payment is, and perhaps telling them that if
    they don&#39;t pony up within <i>x</i> more days, <i>y</i> action will take place.
    <BR> <BR>Action could be: bringing in the lawyers, stopping their email, etc.
    Whatever it is, make sure it&#39;s practical and professionally appropriate. And
    then, as with an unruly child, whatever consequence you promise, you <i>must</i>
    follow through with it. <BR> <BR>A final note: try, if you can, to separate their
    annoying-ness as a client with the nonpayment issue. The work is done, and it
    probably won&#39;t help get you your money if you actively hold that part against
    them. It does sound like a nightmare job -- but in the future, some firm customer
    education up front as to your role can go a long way. <BR> <BR>Good luck! This
    kind of thing happens to most designers at some point, and it is a royal pain
    in the &#149;&#149;&#149;. Be persistent and professional, and bring in the big
    dogs if you have to.'

  body: Eight weeks is 60 days. Receivables have gone from 30 to 45 to 60 and onwards
    to 90 and 120 days. These days in NYC 60 days is not considered an unreasonable
    amount of time to wait for the bill to be paid. <BR> <BR>Not great but it is becoming
    the custom. <BR> <BR>Ive heard a few stories that the traditional wait for receivables
    in the department store business is excess of 360 days. <BR> <BR>I remember not
    too long ago when most invoices were paid in 10 to 30 days.

    but when I do, the terms are in the contract and signed by the client before work

    <BR>There was a contract, including a late payment charge, but the amount involved

    up before then. I&#39;m just pissed off that doing someone a favour ends up like
    this. &#40;I even avoided telling them exactly what I normally charge because

    do clients a favor without telling them, that&#39;s when you most wish they knew.

  body: 'It&#39;s helpful to make it clear on the invoice that there&#39;s interest
    levied on overdue invoices &#40;1.5% to 2% per month is typical&#41;. That way,
    the money owed you by late payers is growing at a rate of 15-20% annually. Not
    a bad investment, assuming you get the money eventually. <BR> <BR>Various books
    on running your own design business suggest strategies for collecting late invoices.
    These include sending monthly invoices with updated figures &#40;due to interest&#41;
    and stages in which polite, hand-written reminders are followed by &#34;Urgent:
    overdue!&#34; envelopes and so forth. <BR> <BR>You want to avoid court and pissing
    off your client, if possible. Many clients buy services they can&#39;t afford
    to pay for - at least not immediately, and often a payment plan &#40;with interest&#41;
    can be worked out if you contact them directly. <BR> <BR>Lastly, make sure you
    have the documentation &#40;a contract helps&#41; available if you need to visit

    href="http://aiga.org/content.cfm?CategoryID=111">AIGA&#39;s Standard Form of
    Agreement for Graphic Design Services</a>&#41; you have nothing in the way of
    legal recourse. I cannot overemphasize the importance of  this. A contract protects
    you and your client and lets them know your a professional. <BR> <BR>Also, I use
    a Project Planner/Client Survey/RFP type document upfront. After initial contact
    has been made and a potential client has expressed an interest in your services,
    have them fill out such a survey which forces them to really think about their
    goals, customers and competition. If they are unable to do this, that&#39;s a
    red flag. It indicates that they really don&#39;t know why they&#39;re doing what
    they&#39;re doing. Without a proof of concept, it&#39;s nearly impossible to create
    anything of value. At this point, you may want to meet with them in person to
    &#34;go through&#34; the survey. Some clients are better at talking about what
    they need than writing it down. Either way, the information &#40;or lack thereof&#41;
    provided in such a document/meeting goes a long way torward indicating weather
    the project is feasible. <BR> <BR>Lastly, if there charging 70quid for haircuts,
    they can afford your full rate. Don&#39;t EVER undersell yourself. <BR> <BR>At
    least you have control over the domain, so you can always just switch it off.

    &#34;forgetta about it.&#34;  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Steve, does your jurisdiction have a small claims court? Filing a claim for
    small claims court is typically fairly simple and lawyer-free. You go and get
    the forms and you officially notify the client that they have X number of days
    in which to pay before you file the papers. This is usually enough to prompt someone
    into writing a cheque.

    fear that it is something one includes to make one feel empowered, but when push
    comes to shove... <BR> <BR>Are you really going to jepordize your business relationship
    for a few fracational percentage points of short term interest, if your client
    decides to pay on 60 instead of 30 days? Or 90 instead of 45? <BR> <BR>One may

  body: I collect on my late fees when the client is markedly late. It doesn&#39;t
    jeopardize my business relationship -- I keep it friendly, and I&#39;ll generally
    waive the fee the first time or if the client asks me to because of a special
    circumstance. <BR> <BR>I only have one client who regularly pays late; since I
    do ongoing work for them, I invoice them every month and just add the late fee
    to the next month&#39;s invoice. They always pay eventually, with no complaints.
    I don&#39;t see any problem with this practice. I&#39;m not so rigid that I would
    let it interfere with the relationship -- but as I mentioned to Steve, the late
    fee lets me continue working for them without resentment.
