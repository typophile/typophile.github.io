body: "I recently began working with the Computer zhisotry Museum and will be developing
  various websites and signage for new and upcoming exhibits. I have found it a challenge
  to develop  clearly legible signs that are readable from a distance using Victorian
  era fonts. Our Charles Babbage exhibit and website open in September 2007 and I
  would appreciate any input others may have on the font usage located here; \r\n\r\nhttp://www.computerhistory.org/babbage\r\n\r\nThis
  is a splash page for the site/exhibit that is coming. "
