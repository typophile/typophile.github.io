body: Hi everyone, I'm new to the site and very impressed. Hope you can help me! A
  Nursery School which advertises with us has had several changes of personnel and
  as a result their font name has been lost in the mists of time. They would love
  to use the font for new stationery, adverts etc and we hope you can help us to identify
  it. A small sample is attached. Thanks in anticipation.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/st_john_font_6239.jpg]

    type ID masters.

    of trying to ID every bit of type I see. Maybe there's still hope for future generations....

    body: Many thanks everyone! I am trying hard not to spend too long on this fabulous
      site in case I too get hooked. I am already guilty of such misdemeanors as ID-ing
      fonts on billboards as I drive around town... I'll contact the nursery now and
      give them the good news!
