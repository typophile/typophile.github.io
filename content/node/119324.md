    close.\r\nOr, even better, Bazhanov (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/bazhanov/),
    which is the original display cut.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Don, your posts have more edits
    than a controversial Wikipedia entry! ;-)"

    first was Bazhanov. Not that it makes any difference in the real world beyond
