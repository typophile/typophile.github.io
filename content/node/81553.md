body: "Looking for blackletters on food packaging for the thread over in General Discussions,
  I saw this coffee brand over in the immigrant-item grocery store here in Kista,
  which appears to be from the Balkans somewhere, possibly Croatian as far as I can
  tell:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/artikel_9003_9004_9005_9006_4219.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  really like the script at the bottom, that says \"mljevena\" and \"pc\u017Eena u
  zcnu\". It seems to nicely synthesise Baseball-style scripts with contemporary blackletters
  like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/fakir/|Fakir]] and [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/blaktur|Blaktur]],
  or possibly something in the Grecian vein, like the italic of [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100000|Acropolis]].\r\n\r\nAny
  idea what it could be? Custom? Or a typeface?"
