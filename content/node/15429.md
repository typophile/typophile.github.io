body: "this isn't really a strictly type related topic, but i'm a designer and i love
  the typography and i recently stepped up as organizer for the chicago graphic design
  group meetup.\r\n\r\nif you don't know what meetup is, it's pretty self explanatory.
  you meet with a bunch of people who are interested in the same thing you are. the
  chicago graphic design group has been without an organizer for quite some time and
  we're just getting it back on it's feet so the more turn out the better, of course.
  we've had one meeting since i've been organizer and the second is coming up fast\r\n\r\noctober
  6th at the digital bootcamp, for all you chicagoans out here. i'd love to see some
  typophiles in the ranks!\r\n\r\nthis is the link to our meetup page. it has all
  the info on where to go and when to go.\r\nagain, hope to see some of you there.
  we could use some good authorities on type and graphic design\r\n\r\nhttp://graphicdesign.meetup.com/71/\r\n\r\nw|m"
