  script looks a bit like Young Gallant, Tangier, or Aphrodite, and the condensed
  gothic type could be any number of things (Knockout, Trade Gothic, Titling Gothic,

  body: The script is <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-aaVKgX">Bickham Script</a> (with
    some alternate characters on the b and r--Bickham is lousy with alternates). The
    sans is <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-NU4POy">Univers Ultra Condensed Light</a>.
