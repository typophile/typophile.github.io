  body: "Vignelli Associates has numerous beautifully-done design systems created
    with their own version of Bodoni. There are some examples on their site (http://www.vignelli.com),
    and even more in their book Design Is One.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Massimo-Vignelli-International-Graphic-Design/dp/1920744525/sr=1-1/qid=1169942589/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4340979-3379149?ie=UTF8&s=books

  body: "I know this is a small-minded comment, but somehow I hold a design office
    like Vignelli's to a higher standard than I do most people. They took the trouble
    to control their typography so much that they are supplying it in gif form rather
    than html text, but look at the fifth line down (Fodor) in this list and tell
    me if Signor Bodoni made that apostrophe:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.vignelli.com/vignelli/clients/pubdes.html\r\n\r\nBruce

    six of the piano concerti with Sasha Schneider and the English Chamber Orchestra
    -- on LPs of course! And I'm even remembering to supply a closing tag.)</em> "
