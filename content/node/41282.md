  body: "There was a PhotoLettering font called Benguiat Charisma Shaded that was
    identical to this. There was an Expresiv PhotoLettering font set from 1994 (which
    I have) that includes this font, and an unshaded Script version as well. This
    suggests that Candice may have been another digitization of Charisma.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Candice and Candice Inline were released by Letraset in 1976. At first glance,
    Candice and Benguiat Charisma seem very similar, but put them side by side and
    they are about as different (or similar, if you will) as Cooper Black and Goudy
    Heavyface.
