  on google.\r\n\r\nI'm planning a project about \"phonetic spelling\". So I need
  a font that has all those diacritics and whatever glyphs a phonetic-spelling font
  has to have. The question that came up is if it is actually \"allowed\" to just
  buy a font family and build (alter) my own custom version of it for the phonetic
  alphabet?\r\n\r\nIs this legally ok? Thinking about the process I'm just thinking
  of buying a suited font for the project and alter it in Fontlab or Glyhps (or whatever
  comes in handy) and create my own custom version of it. \r\n\r\nI guess a consequent
  question is where do I use this font, right?\r\nThe project is going to be a book
  later. And if it is possible the the font should also be available as a download.
  \r\nThe reason the font should also be downloaded is that this book project is part
  of a greater regional project that is about phonetic spelling and it would of course
  be good if the custom-made font (which is probably a lot of work) is also available
  later for other uses.\r\n\r\nCan you please fill me in with some details about that
  matter. What is possible and what not?\r\nWould it for instance be possible to sell
  this custom font afterwards that is based on top of an already existing font? I
  guess not.\r\n\r\nThank you for your tips and answers."

  body: "It's complicated.  :-)\r\n\r\nYou have to read the EULA. Especially these
    days few commercial fonts allow modification - official permission must be obtained.
    The biggest exception is Adobe, bless them. Personally I'm actually OK with violating
    a \"no-mod\" EULA clause* but you might not be. In no case however may the modified
    font be redistributed; the only usual exception is that a third-party (who however
    must also have a license to the font) may be commissioned to modify a font (something
    I myself have had the fortune of doing).\r\n\r\n* Because I believe it's -generally-
    unreasonable, sometimes even disrespectful. However, the resultant font must stay
    firmly confined to the modifier; if it <em>does</em> leak out the modifier must
    accept full responsibility and face the consequences.\r\n\r\nThe good news is
    that these days there are a number of decent \"open-source\" fonts that are freely
    modifiable and re-distributable (although very few of those allow you to sell
    the results, at least not without packaging them in a broader product). I say
    \"decent\" however because -as one might expect with free products- such fonts
    often don't perform adequately when push comes to shove; the amount of time fixing
    things one shouldn't have to fix can offset the cost of modifying a commercial
    font... There are exceptions, but it's hard to identify them without serious research.
    We actually have an active forum member by the name of Charles who has a good
    deal of experience using open-source fonts in professional projects - hopefully
    he'll help you find a suitable one.\r\n\r\nBTW, I assume you have some experience
    using a font editor? It's no cakewalk, although very basic modifications can proceed
    pretty smoothly.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    quite exhaustive...\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/97575\r\n\r\nReynir went
    to considerable lengths to compile an overview of what is available from different
    sources.\r\n\r\nThe [[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?event=displayFontPackage&code=1959|Adobe
    Source Sans Pro fonts]], released last year come with the level of polish and
    professional development that you would expect from Adobe's type team (specifically,
    Paul Hunt) and as such there are few better recommendations. It made [[http://typographica.org/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2012/|Typographica's
    Favorite Typefaces of 2012 list]] along with another typeface, Alegraya variations
    of which are available under an open source license.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Would

    able to do this with Adobe's original fonts (those for which the IP resides with
    them) subject to the license agreement terms and conditions (which include stipulations
    around how and where the modified fonts can be used). Contacting the copyright
    holder in such matters is always advisable as they will be able to give you a
    definitive answer on what you can and cannot do with the fonts.\r\n"

  body: "The only restriction on most open-source (AKA \"libre\") fonts is that you
    can't sell them (or modified versions) by themselves (although you <em>can</em>
    sell a broader packaged product).\r\n\r\nIt depends on your standards, but there
    aren't many really good ones, as attested by the fact that out of Typographica's
    55 \"favorite\" fonts of 2012 (that Karl linked to) only at most 1.5 are free.\r\n\r\nIf
    you ask the designer of a non-libre (AKA \"proprietary\") font for permission
    to modify it, he will probably demand a fee (or just say no). And the only way
    to redistribute such a font is to buy the rights, which typically costs thousands
    of dollars.\r\n\r\nI think your best bet is to see if there's a free (not necessarily
    libre) font that suits your needs and is of sufficient quality. Failing that you
    should be able to find a libre font that comes close, and pay somebody* to extend
    -and often correct- things for you, or do it yourself. Depending on how much work
    that libre font would need, it might be cheaper to go with an Adobe font instead.\r\n\r\n*
    Like yours truly.  :-)\r\nhpapazian at gmail dot com\r\nThere are however many
    others reading this that can do the job for you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
