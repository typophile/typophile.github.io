  to post here too:\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/48260]]\r\n\r\nI'm looking for
  further advice about where I can find further resources on, most likely, IBM fonts.
  \ Probably late Executive series or Selectric series fonts?  I'm trying to match
  the type in the samples I've posted.  Any IBM font experts out there?\r\n\r\nI'm
  confused but trying to learn.  Thanks for any of your input."
