    years. My grandfather was in the SeaBees at the end of WWII.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing
    you did a tour or two in Vietnam. Is that correct? I was part of the Army Corps
    of Engineers and I know they were very active in operation Cedar Falls. However,
    how involved were the SeaBees in Vietnam?"

  body: "Mark,\r\nYes, I was in Nam in 1967-68. I was in MCB6. Our home base was in
    Chu Lai in the I core. We worked on highway 1 from Quang Nai to Quang Tri but
    I spent most of my time in Quang Tin. The SeaBees were very involved in Viet Nam,
    mostly supporting the Marines. During my last few months in Nam, including the
    Tet offensive of 1968, the Marines 3rd MAF moved further north to Que San and
    were replaced by the Army's Americal Division. The Mi Lai massacre happened nearby
    during my tour.\r\n\r\nHere is a picure of me there in 1968:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NamChris_2_4732.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Nope I print Unit markings for Military vehicles and a client is looking
    for the SeaBee Logo, I was able to reproduce the logo but can not reproduce the
    type.  Scanned looks awful.  It is a Vietnam era Seabee Logo.  The image below
    was taken from a Brass Stencil we are trying to match\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SeaBee_6607.JPG]\r\n\r\nBecause

    image.\r\nI am sure you won't find a typeface that matches. It was probably drawn
    in the 1940s by a CB draftsman using old fashioned hand tools like pen and brush
    in the true \"Can Do\" spirit :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "My dad was there roughly during the same time period. I remember him telling
    me that he was in the areas described in Full Metal Jacket, when the reporter
    asks the John Wayne-esque platoon leader for some directions. He was with the
    5th Marines. He was also aboard ship during the Cuban missile blockade.\r\n\r\nThat's
    a great photo, man! I bet it brings back a flood of memories. You build. You fight.
    Thank you very much for your service.\r\n\r\nErik,\r\n\r\nWhen I was at MacWorld
    San Francisco, there was a vendor there that sold military clip art. Some of them
    were only available to those in the corresponding departments. I seem to recall
    seeing a few versions of the SEABEES logo. However, I was just doing a search
    and can not for the life of me, remember who it was."
