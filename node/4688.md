  body: illustration is excellent, although I am not sure right side saucer reflection/edge  is
    necessary. I think without right side saucer edge/reflection it may be more usable
    in various applications.  <BR> <BR>If this retailer ever decided to haveor sponsor
    movie nights a variation on this logo could be really nice as it already has a
    bit of a camera shutter efffect going. <BR> <BR>Type is nice but not as special
    as illustration. What typeface-it looks familiar but I am not sure? <BR> <BR>Since
    name has &#34;centre&#34; in it, have you tried placing logo between the words
    &#34;espresso&#34; and &#34;centre&#34;

  body: Thank you very much indeed for your fresh and professional eye. I used font
    Tahoma here but not sure about it and I am not sure about red colors as well.
    If I place a cup between words I will looks good But I am affraid a cup will get
    lost a little bit in this case... <BR> <BR>And at the end, could you to critic
    please my logo for company, which interests are in education and real estate fields.

  body: hi, <BR>nice idea but -- rid the red immediately!! red its nice but not this
    red go for the deep red if u must, this one is not for hot coffee with aroma smell,
    dont take the brown its too obvious &amp; so simple. i say -- go for the red purple
    like the aubergine.  <BR>the font is fine but if u can look for something round
    but more bold. <BR>good luck.

    The lines might be too narrow for, for example, printing napkins '
