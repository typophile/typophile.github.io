  body: "All of that lettering is probably hand-painted. Seems that the two A's in
    BROADWAY are a bit different (look at the counters). However, you can find similar
    styles at [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/|Letterhead Fonts]], as those guys
    are lettering artists too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
