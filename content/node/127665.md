    are 1150 matched fonts in total, and the most similar font is Fenix BlackletterCaps
    Regular. \r\nThis is my identification result page for your image: http://en.likefont.com/community/5263108/"

    body: That definitely looks like the Fenix family and I imagine the grunge effect
      was probably done in Photoshop so unlikely to get a 100% match. Thanks for the
