  body: "I'm glad to see you took my advice to post this here. I have still been looking,
    but so far only finding 'close' ideas, like <a href=\"http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=289&dw=1727\"
    target=\"new\">Rally</a> from Identikal. I think some simple editing of this font
    could produce a similar look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
