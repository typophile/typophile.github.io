  by The Entente.\r\nIt's used a lot for digital platforms, but was there a specific
  project it was originally created for?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nTom"

  body: "From the [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/apercu/about-font|Colophon-Foundry
    web site]]...\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Aper\xE7u was started in December 2009, and has
    been trialled and tested through a number of design comissions taken on by The
    Entente through 2010. The conceit behind Aper\xE7u was to create a synopsis or
    amalgamation of classic realist typefaces: Johnston, Gill Sans, Neuzeit & Franklin
    Gothic.\r\n\r\nSince its release in August 2010, Aper\xE7u quickly found its position
    in the market, being used across a variety of different media and sectors around
    the world in both print and web. It has been utilized by institutions such as
    MOMA, De Wiels, Zeit Magazine and the Walker Art Center.</blockquote>"
