  in this field. \r\nI have attempted a letter integration of my initials R and S.
  With the capital letters I found it too disconnected in the form to integrate but
  the moment I shifted to small letters, I found a couple of directions to try it
  in.\r\nI would really appreciate if you could take some time out and give me feedback
  on how to improve this further.\r\n\r\nThank You\r\n\r\nReshma Shaik[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rs

  body: "I like it (more so, R and S being my initials too ;-)\r\n\r\nI think you
    could lower a little the left part of r.\r\nAlso, I would remove the serifs (or
    make them more prominent)."

  body: You need to lower the top of the stem of r. Right now it's the same level
    as the top of the s and so optically it looks even higher.

  body: "It might do well to decrease the size of the smaller circle by a very small
    percent.\r\n\r\nThe obvious problem with the swash to me is that its lower terminating
    point is much sharper than the upper. And the negative space/outline on the top
    does not actually match the curve of the filled portion. Make sense?"

  body: Sorry for taking long to fix it. But I made some changes based on the suggestions.
    Please take a look at them and let me know if the form seems more refined. Thank
    You for your time.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_4598.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_6552.jpg]

  body: Could you maybe connect the bottom ball with the part of the 's'? It would
    make sense for the 'r' to have a ball and then the 's' to have one of his own
    as well.

  body: "Those serifs could easily follow the shape of the ball terminal. The r arm
    is a bit heavy, and it\u2019s curves needs some more attention."
