body: Hi,  <BR>I would like to have some suggestions for a typeface for photographer
  that is going to start a business  in children&#39;s portraits. Her style is relaxed
  and spontaneus and is all done outdoor on location using only available light &#40;no
  flash&#41;. I&#39;ve looked around on the web and most photographers that do this
  kind of natural light portrait photography use scripts. <BR>Any ideas for a font?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Barbara P.

    target="_blank"> Sauna</a>?

  body: Thanks for the suggestion. I think Sauna it&#39;s quite expensive though,
    it looks like  I would have to buy the whole family at $295.00 &#40;they don&#39;t
    sell individual fonts&#41;.

  body: I agree with the font choice of Sauna..it&#39;s a nice clean font unlike many
    children&#39;s fonts which look rugged and unprofessional.
