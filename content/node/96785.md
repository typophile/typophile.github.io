  many typefaces does not work with it. Only several typefaces work with this program
  such as Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana and other typefaces do not work on it.\r\n\r\nWhat
  could be the problem and how could I use free typefaces on this program???"

    from major foundries, others can be crap. You'll have to be more specific on which
    ones you intend to use.\r\n\r\nAs for why some fonts work with PowerPoint and
    others don't, somebody else will have to explain that."

    with those typefaces. It just doesn\u2019t \u201Cembed\u201D them. So, if you
    create a document using them and pass it to someone else which doesn\u2019t have
    them on their computer, they cannot see them.\r\nMaybe there is a way to embed
    fonts in PP documents, but I don\u2019t know it."

    but unfortunately you can't with the Mac version.\r\n\r\nPersonally I prefer to
    prepare slides using Photoshop or InDesign and then import them into PowerPoint
    as JPEGs. More work but much greater control, you can use any fonts you want,
    and there's no risk of PowerPoint changing fonts or resizing / reflowing text.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    each slide a JPEG isn't the way to go.  \r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure how a PDF would
    be better for making content editable. Editing text in a PDF can be done in Adobe
    Acrobat but isn't very practical (text doesn't reflow, for example). Or are you
    talking about keeping the doc in an editable format like Word and then making
    a PDF when done?"

    content, then using directly a PDF would be give a better quality than JPGs pasted
    into PowerPoint (plus, one can also extract the text)."

  body: OK, I understand.  Most of the PPTs I work on are intended to be projected
    on a large screen for a big group to view as a slide show, so PDFs wouldn't be
    the way to go, but in other situations certainly PDFs can be a great solution.

  body: "@JamesM: Acrobat has a presentation mode (Command + L on the Mac) which expands
    the document to fill the screen. You can set transitions between pages, and it
    responds to USB \"clickers\" to advance the pages. As mentioned, it's not a great
    solution when you're trading slides with the sales team. But for self-produced,
    self-contained presentations, I greatly prefer the typographic/image control of
    an \"InDesign to PDF to Acrobat presentation mode\" workflow.\r\n\r\nAs for the
    OP's original question: do those free fonts work in other applications? Have you
    restarted PPT after installing them? Unlike the Creative Suite apps, Powerpoint
    (at least on the Mac) isn't smart enough to recognize newly activated fonts on
    the fly."

    software for that matter, but it's an awful program that should be avoided like
    the plague.

  body: I would like to second marcox's full-screen PDF presentation scheme. This
    is how I have done many "PowerPoint" presentations. PDFs even support sound and
    video files. If I need more sophisticated animations than I can do in PDF, I will
    use Apple's Kenote, which has some very decent typography controls. Even then,
    though, I will usually set all my text in InDesign, output to PDF, and then place
    into Keynote. Because of the non-ubiquitousness of Keynote, though, this only
    works if you are providing your own computer (and projector dongle) for the presentation.
    I have also been known to use QLab for presentations, and various other programs.
    PowerPoint is never one of them.

  body: "PowerPoint offers one main thing that PDF lacks in presentation mode, and
    that is the ability to have my laptop screen displaying mostly my notes (along
    with a mini slide, and preview of the next one), while projecting just the slide
    on the other screen, and keeping the two in sync.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I use
    PDF more often than PowerPoint for presentations. Especially when I might need
    to present on somebody else's hardware."
