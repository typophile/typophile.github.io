body: What pieces of work should all enthusiasts in editorial know about? Would you
  be able to recommend any I should look at? Any particular design agencies? I've

  body: Please refrain from commenting in threads to which you don't have anything
    to add. It makes complete sense that not every thread will appeal to every participant
    on Typophile. It is common courtesy.
