  body: 1&#41; It would be good to make this font in a way that it can be combined
    with a specific existing Latin font&#42;, for projects that might use both scripts.
    This is because you need to worry about comparable color, apparent size, etc.
    This doesn&#39;t mean you have to mimic all the letterform structures though &#40;in
    fact I think the opposite&#41;. <BR>2&#41; If this is a text face, I think your
    caps/lc proportion is way too big. In fact I believe the Cyrillic &#34;x-height&#34;
    needs to be bigger &#40;relative to the Latin font you&#39;re matching&#41;. Predictably,
    the &#34;establishment&#34; disagrees with this &#40;but I feel that&#39;s just
    Modernism&#39;s spell&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; Unless you make you&#39;re own Latin
    too! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Hrant: <BR> <BR>At this point I am not too concerned about complementary
    Latin font; Ninfe is intended for predominantly cyrillic texts &#40;although Adobe
    Jenson works fine except for capital height&#41;. <BR> <BR>This definitely is
    supposed to be a text face. Capitals are higher than usual for cyrillic fonts;
    I plan to include a second lower-than-usual set to be used as &#34;small caps&#34;,
    upright capitals for italic, and in Eric Gill&#39;s manner &#40;high caps start
    paragraphs, low caps used in all other places&#41;. This should give enough flexibility
    for both pro- and contra-establishment uses. <BR>  '

  body: Thanks for good words. Lowercase el is on my list, as well as lowercase ae
    reverse &#40;central ~ is too light&#41; and uppercase U &#40;tail needs more
    work&#41;. I also plan to make uppercase Zhe assymetrical &#40;light upward/dark
    downward strokes&#41; to enforce calligraphic axis of the font.
