body: "Hello, I am a longtime reader, a recently registered user, and now, a first
  time poster.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a font design that will enable users
  to designate separate colors for two separate stripes within the strokes. Theoretically,
  there will be two font files for each weight; metrics and kerning pairs will correspond
  between the two font files so that, when a user typesets text in the first color/font
  file, they can then paste-in-place the text box, select the text and switch it to
  the second color/font file. I'm not familiar with the precedents for this, so if
  anyone can enlighten me, I'd greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThe two stripes within
  the strokes intertwine or weave over and under each other (see first image below),
  making for what I presume could be quite a headache ahead of me in getting the font
  functional in FontLab (I've been using Illustrator to build the paths as I'm more
  comfortable with it). I'm very new to type design and have tried to get a grasp
  on the 1000 vs 2048 UPM concept by reading past Typophile threads but admit I'm
  helplessly lost. I first tried 1000 UPM and found that it distorted some of my curves.
  I've seen better fidelity results using 2048 now, but am having much trouble in
  getting the areas where the stripes intersect to perfectly align (see second image
  below). If anyone has <em>any</em> suggestions whatsoever, please let me know!\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nAndy"

  body: "You need to read the section of the Fontlab manual that explains how to configure
    Illustrator so that you can bring your outlines into Fontlab with no distortion.
    Because you did not do this before you started you must tweak your existing drawings
    to work as a font no matter what you do. \r\n\r\nDo not create your work as a
    2048 UPM TrueType font, stick to a 1000 UPM Postcript. If you use TT the curves
    will get distorted if users convert the fonts to outlines and it will screw up
    your careful attempts to avoid overlapping.\r\n\r\nRosewood is a great chromatic
    font that comes with Adobe Creative Suite. There\u2019s a manual for using it
    either on the CDs or available somewhere at Adobe.com"

  body: 'I would strongly suggest that you build the font directly in Fontlab. I cannot
    stress enough how much trouble it will save you. Also, independently of if you
    do this or not I would suggest that you make a 3rd reference font in which all
    the parts you need are present and that you use the use the remove overlap tool
    located in "actions" to make the cuts you need then they will be completely precise.
    Note that to have the change be subtractive you will need to have the direction
    of the outlines be opposite each other. Also having made the subtraction happen
    you need to check your outline direction is correct. I have just tested this and
    it works. I am not at all convinced that with the category of shapes you are showing
    above that you need more than a UPM of 1000. '

  body: "Jackson, James, and Eben: your responses are invaluable. Thanks very much.
    I will look into how Adobe configured the specs for Rosewood. I'm glad I realized
    this problem now, at a point when I've only designed a dozen or so of the characters,
    rather than make all of the characters in Illustrator for this and the other weights
    of the family I hope to create and be pulling my hair out months from now. Eben:
    I assume the 3rd reference font file you are suggesting I create would be one
    I make simply for completing the two separate color font files? Which is to say,
    you're not suggesting that this 3rd file be included in a package should I ever
    make the font commercially available?\r\n\r\nMany thanks again to all three of
    you!"
