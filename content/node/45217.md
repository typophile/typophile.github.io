  which I really like. Today I received a brief where this typeface would fit perfectly
  but wasn't able to find it anywhere.\r\nAnyone knows anything about it?\r\nPlease
  let me know.\r\nThanks\r\nFrederico"

  body: Both of those look fantastic! I assume not, but does anyone have bigger samples
    or PDFs of either? If you never ask, you never know ...

  body: Thanks, Gerben, but I was actually referring to FF Ratio and Carter's typeface.
    I've already devoured the specimens for last year's Reading designs :-)

  body: Ah, I saw that FF Ratio flyer on Flickr quite some time ago (you can [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/katanan/1073050314/sizes/o/|find
    a larger image here]]). I also thought it's excellent. More news would definitely
    be appreciated, Stephen! :)

    but that was a much better peek.

  body: I have a lot of respect for Mark Caneso and his work, but it was decided at
    this week's FontFont Type Board that Ratio is not right for the foundry. I wish
    him all the best with the typeface and I'm sure he'll do other great things soon.

    see what you mean in that pdf you posted.\r\nBut I agree it's a nice take nevertheless.
