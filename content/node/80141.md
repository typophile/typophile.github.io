body: "Hello everyone, I'm new here, My name is Adam and I'm from Poland.\r\n\r\nI
  really enjoy watching and working with type while doing internship \r\nin one of
  fast growing branding studio in Gda\u0144sk.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I'm still working
  on my personal portfolio and trying to \r\nmake logotype for my web alias (not best
  naming but I like it). \r\nImage of second version is attached, first was based
  on avant garde, \r\nnew one (attached one) is based on gotham.\r\n\r\nMy main concerns
  are about light between glyphs and proportions of \r\n\"D\" merged with \"1\". I
  got some concerns also about \"E\" but my main \r\nproblem is \"1D\" and overall
  kerning, focus on that.\r\n\r\nIf there is any typophile so kind to help me with
  his knowledge and \r\ngood eye I would be very thankful for help.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think you could keep the 1/D mashup as logo and spell the name simply as
    wordmark.\r\nAlso, you could make the 1 a little bit taller, so that its spur
    (?) will be visually centered."
