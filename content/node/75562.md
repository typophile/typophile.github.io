body: "Hello type community,\r\n\r\nI'm here to anounce a new release from my independent
  foundry. That's <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/alegria/|Alegria]]</strong>,
  a display type family designed for joyful communication. It is composed by Alegria
  Roman (with upper/lowercase and oldstyle figures), Alegria Caps (with uppercase,
  small caps and lining figures), Alegria Bright (am open face small caps version)
  and Alegria Fill (that can be used as a second layer with Bright or Caps faces to
  create multiple colors on the text).\r\n\r\n<strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/alegria/|Alegria
  family]]</strong>is already available to purchase at <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/alegria/|MyFonts]]</strong>.
  I hope you enjoy it! :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alegria-poster1a_3805.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alegria-poster2_5206.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alegria-poster4_4156.png]"

  body: "Parab\xE9ns pelo lan\xE7amento, Ricardo!\r\n\r\nIt's always interesting to
    see Brazilian type designers releasing quality fonts. Alegria has a nice, freshy
    feel. And the name is as insightful as the fill compostion.\r\n\r\nThere is any
    reason to your glyphs be shown in an unusual order at MyFonts? Not a problem,
    of course, but I became curious. Little suggestion: you may explain what the word
    Alegria means to non-Portuguese speakers."

  body: "Thanks Dan, Mike and Igor!\r\n\r\nIgor, I'll try to figure out why the glyph
    map appers in that unusual way. Anyway, it does not affect any function of the
    fonts themselves. They have a complete set of Western, Central European, Baltic,
    Turkish and Romanian encodings.\r\n\r\nBTW folks, Alegria means Joy. :-D"
