  different names, and he wants THAT font. Help! If I have to hand draw all this lettering
  it will be the death of me, but nothing close is making him happy, he wants this,
  exactly. Does it exist; this lettering is so uniform, I don't believe it was hand
  drawn; perhaps it's a modern replica done with type> I'm crossing my fingers someone
  has seen these two fonts somewhere. He even want the type above Benny's Name, as
  well: \"The Kind Of Swing...\"  that, also, is a mystery to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Benny_5912.jpg]"
