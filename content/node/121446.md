body: "At the second qualification game, it was quiet different when Germany had to
  face the Finn team. The game took place in front of a quintuplicate number of spectators
  at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki. The Finn national team took the lead with one
  goal within the first half hour but Germany\u2019s skipper Miroslav Klose managed
  the tie in just five minutes. After another few minutes Germany fell again behind
  but as well as the first time Germany\u2019s skipper was at the spot and scored
  for the tie. Then came the half time. Just a few minutes of the second half Finland
  managed the 3:2 goal and it seemed like this would become the final score. But short
  time before the final whistle, Klose scored and tied the game. This is how he kept
  his team from the first defeat.<a href=\"http://www.alimmogold.com/Aura-Kingdom-Gold_A959/\">http://www.alimmogold.com/Aura-Kingdom-Gold_A959/</a>\r\n\r\nThe
  next opponent of the German team will be the Russian team coached by Guus Hiddink.
  Russia grinded out a 2:1 victory against Wales last Wednesday. This coming up game
  will take place in almost one month next October 11th, in Dortmund.\r\n\r\nNot as
  much luck, on the other hand, had the Swiss national team who is headed by former
  Bundesliga-coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. The team lost after a balanced first half at the
  end by 1:2 against Luxemburg. Along with the tie from the previous game against
  Israel, Switzerland is now in the fifth place of their group. There are still eight
  games to go for Hitzfeld\u2019s team so we will see if they will be able to ensure
  themselves a ticket to Africa.\r\n\r\nDefending champion Italy can breathe again.
  After the elimination in the quarter finals of the European Cup, the team leads
  now their group chart.  With two victories against Cyprus and Georgia they accumulated
  six points.<a href=\"http://www.alimmogold.com/FIFA-14-Coins_A953/\">Purchase Cheap

  \"the president has opened up a new channel of popular involvement in Nigerian politics,
  encouraging young people to feel like they have a voice. This can only be a good
  thing.\"<a href=\"http://www.alimmogold.com\">Wow Gold, Guild Wars 2 Gold, Runescape
