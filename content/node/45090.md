  body: "My 2 cents:\r\n\r\n- Overall it's a bit dense and clunky. Try reducing the
    font sizes and increasing your margins.\r\n- To open some whitespace you could
    easily move your dates inline with either your job title or company\r\n- month
    abbreviations should be consistent (Sep Jun Mar) and use an en dash between dates
    instead of a hyphen\r\n- Don't think the one instance of Frutiger Extra Black
    works. I think Futura Medium at that size would work or you could pick a more
    complimentary typeface.\r\n- I  think your email and phone number should be the
    same size and weight. Could also go on the same line with some sort of separator
    (bar or bullet).\r\n- Not a fan of the oblique style of Futura."

  body: "Byron,\r\nGeneral advice before the typographic composition critique:\r\nDepending
    on your choice of career, I would thin out this resume to the three or four jobs
    that will mean anything at all to your next employer (or maybe just two jobs and
    really emphasize your education). Your employer needs to see that you are capable
    of choosing only the elements that are most pertinent before beginning a composition.
    Keep in mind also that intelligent use of negative space is important and will
    really set your resume apart from the rest.\r\nThe typography:\r\nfirst impressions\u2014you
    need more margins. The difference between the bold and the regular is too much;
    find and use a middle weight. Use leading more generously between lines.\r\nIf
    you're wanting to make a statement with Futura then make it loud and clear\u2014including
    your name at the top. Otherwise, choose something else that fits you better.\r\nSuggestions:\r\nTry
    making the type a little smaller. Instead of explicitly using dark black rules
    all the way across the page, consider something implicit that fulfills the same
    task. As I write this I get the feeling that you should be spending the majority
    of your resume telling the story of your education. I would also suggest creating
    a book PDF or website and linking your resume to it.\r\nBest Regards\r\nDavid"
