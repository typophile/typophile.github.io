    (except for PNGs, of course).\r\nThat said, I don\u2019t see much typography going
    on on the home page.\r\nYou could start looking at this:\r\nhttp://webtypography.net/"

  body: "To riccard0 thank you for your sensible reply, i am looking at webtypography.net
    and i will continue to make it better. \r\n\r\nIt renders fine on any browser
    just my navigation is not appearing as it should on Internet Explorer otherwise
    everything is fine there. \r\n\r\nTO ANGRY PEOPLE \"ITS NOT LIKE I HATE IE\" i
    didn't want to put extra effort to make it look good on IE."
