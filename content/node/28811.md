  ( see attachment ) \r\n\r\nWhich made me wonder. Does this kind of letter style
  have a formal name? I have seen it infrequestly but it does seem to have some consistancy
  to it. It isn't like an italic or a small cap - it's more dynamic & wacky than that.
  But it isn't quite full blown lettering. You could probably develop scripts to make
  a font do it if you were so inclined. But my main question is Does it have a name?
  Extra points if anyone knows how & where it started & why. "

  body: That is certainly descriptive. Since it is spanish/portuguese in origin (
    i think) I was thinking they might have a name for it. Maybe I will ask some brazilian
    spanish & portguese folks. If I get a formal name I'll post it here.
