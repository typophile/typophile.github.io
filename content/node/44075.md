body: "\r\nHello.\r\n\r\nI have two questions..\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anyone has
  tips on how to control paragraph rules? I've applied paragraph rules to headers
  on a book but whenever these headers end up on top of the column, the rule either
  sits above or below the column margin, depending on the text's baseline and/or space
  applied by the paragraph style.\r\n\r\nThe other question is about keep options
  settings. I've fudged with both the keep options and H&J settings on my paragraph
  styles to no success. The awkward paragraph breaks are brutal. :(\r\n\r\nBelow is
  a PDF.. Be gentle, pls note I haven't finessed the layout/typesetting yet. I'm still
  figuring out how to control the paragraph rules and paragraph breaks.\r\n\r\nAnything
  helps, thank you!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thisissoft.com/breastfeeding2_full_12pt.pdf"

  body: "I think I'm not completely clear on what you're asking, but my understanding
    is that your headers are not aligning to the leading you have set for it.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing that I immediately noticed is that there is no baseline grid being used.
    In two-column text (page 8), it looks odd having the baselines not match up. I
    strongly suggest you set this up. By fixing your paragraph styles to the baseline
    grid, I think your headers will fit as you're wishing them to. (in paragraph styles:
    INDENTS AND SPACING, choose the drop-down menu ALIGN TO GRID>ALL LINES).\r\n\r\nApologies
    if i'm answering the wrong question"

  body: "Thanks so much.. The baselines are now lining up quite nicely, much improved.\r\n\r\nMy
    question is regarding the main headers \u2013 or rather the rules of the main
    headers \u2013 not lining up properly with the column margins. The leading/spacing
    style applied to the main headers are affecting the way its rules sit in relation
    to the top of the column. You can see this happening on the left side of spreads
    2-4 on the PDF below. Specifically these headers: \"All You Need Is A Baby, A
    Breast And A Brain\" \"Milk Release\" \"Maintaining Milk Supply\"\r\n\r\nIf anyone
    has any valuable tips, much appreciated. Thanks again.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thisissoft.com/7x8_12pt.pdf\r\n\r\nNote:
    It's been suggested that I treat the headers as objects, that way they always
    end up on the margins. I'm afraid that may lead to a nightmare situation once
    copy editing is involved."

  body: "Did you know that you can make a dotted-stroke line, cut it, and then paste
    it in to your actual text block? It will then treat the line as if it is a character
    in the text. With the white arrow, you can adjust it within the paragraph (you
    could also adjust the baseline shift in the style sheet or text palate. This may
    come in handy...\r\n"

  body: We added a feature to InDesign (CS3?) that will shift the first line of text
    down in the frame in order to keep the rule inside the text frame.  It's a checkbox
    in the paragraph rule above dialog labeled "keep in frame".  It isn't available
    for rules that may stick out below the bottom of a frame (but it would be nice).
