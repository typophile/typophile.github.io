  body: "It looks like an italic version of New Caslon Black Swash, maybe graphically
    slanted? It shows up in one of the Dover books by Dan Solo, which means it was
    a pre-digital design.\r\n\r\nI also think Jason Walcott of Jukebox Type has done
    a version of that Caslon (find it at Veer).\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
