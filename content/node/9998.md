body: ' I was wondering if I could get some input on a couple distribution models.
  <BR> <BR>Myself and two friends spend way too much time designing type, for fun,
  for our various projects, for camaraderie and for the journey, not necessarily the
  destination. <BR> <BR>We would like to distribute our work &#40;mostly display stuff&#41;
  ourselves. The problem is the current state of type protection and the mentality
  of most people who think that type &#40;even the best quality of type&#41; should
  be free or next to free. <BR> <BR>We surely don&#39;t want to charge $40 a font.
  But we don&#39;t want to give our stuff away either. <BR> <BR>So we were toying
  with some different ideas. Here&#39;s one approach: <BR> <BR>&#41; We charge a nominal
  fee $2.00 or $3.00 for users to obtain a password to enter our download area. The
  password would change every day.  Once the fee was paid, a person could download
  every font in the download area up to that point. Every time a new font was made
  available for download, then previous &#39;customers&#39; would have to pay the
  nominal fee to get all the new fonts up to that point. <BR> <BR>&#41; The trick
  is to get the tens of thousands of people who expect everything for free to pay
  something. You&#39;d have to entice them with original fonts made available on a
  regular basis. Do pirates and freeware users have $3.00 to spare? We don&#39;t know.
  If we proceed with some form of this model, we would find out. <BR> <BR>&#41; We
  would also offer special stuff &#40;packages that we put way more time into&#41;
  off to the side for &#39;normal retail&#39; prices. <BR> <BR>&#41; We are not as
  much concerned with the brand as we are with these facts: 1&#41; we are making type
  2&#41; we are using our type 3&#41; we&#39;d like others to have the opportunity
  to use it 4&#41; we don&#39;t want to give it away, on general principle and because
  we&#39;d like to at least pay for the bandwith. <BR> <BR>A couple problems: <BR>
  <BR>&#41; Sharing of passwords. Maybe dynamic passwords are possible? <BR> <BR>&#41;
  Charging so little conveys a lack of worth to &#39;regular font buyers&#39;. <BR>
  <BR>&#41; If a customer entered the download section at the end of a &#39;time period&#39;,
  they would get EVERY font for the nominal fee. If a customer entered at the beginning
  of the period, they would only get a couple fonts for their nominal fee. <BR> <BR>&#41;
  E-commerce backbone. Can we devise a system &#40;similar to Amazon&#39;s Honor System&#41;
  that let&#39;s people get in and get out without a lot of buttons to push. <BR>
  <BR>&#41; How hardcore is this backlash against type being overpriced. If people
  in this forum think type at $40 is too much, what are we to think of the general
  public or Joe Graphic Designer? <BR>What SHOULD a font be priced at? <BR> <BR>Any
  feedback would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>bj '

    <BR> <BR>&#62; We charge a nominal fee $2.00 or $3.00 for users to obtain a password
    .... <BR> <BR>Sounds like an interesting basic idea, but does that mean you&#39;re
    charging $2-3 dollars for a cartload of fonts? I don&#39;t get it. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    The trick is to get the tens of thousands of people who expect everything for
    free to pay something. <BR> <BR>Yes! <BR>And don&#39;t forget poor-but-honest
    people who would pay good money for fonts, but simply can&#39;t afford/justify
    it: they should be able to pay &#42;something&#42; and get it. Not just to be
    nice, but because if you say &#34;gimme $100 or get lost&#34;, you&#39;ve just
    created a pirate, and an enemy. <BR> <BR>&#62; You&#39;d have to entice them with
    original fonts made available on a regular basis. <BR> <BR>Note Chank&#39;s &#34;Font-of-the-month
    Club&#34;: $100/year, right? And who was saying that he has ~200 members? Not
    bad. <BR> <BR>&#62; we&#39;d like others to have the opportunity to use it <BR>
    <BR>Yes, not least because exposure is a huge marketing advantage. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    Sharing of passwords. Maybe dynamic passwords are possible?  <BR> <BR>Maybe. But
    don&#39;t fret over that too much anyway. <BR> <BR>&#62; Charging so little conveys
    a lack of worth to &#39;regular font buyers&#39;. <BR> <BR>Yes. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    Amazon&#39;s Honor System <BR> <BR>What&#39;s that? <BR> <BR>&#62; How hardcore
    is this backlash against type being overpriced. <BR> <BR>Not really &#34;backlash&#34;,
    but if you try to sell people something for too much money, they&#39;ll just sacrifice
    another little grain of ethics &#40;that&#39;s all font piracy really takes away
    from a person, a grain of ethics&#41; to get the font. So the price of a font
    should be a grain or a boulder, depending on many things that are usually accounted
    for &#40;like the quality of the font&#41;, but also many things that are not,
    like the wealth of individual customers. <BR> <BR>Example: <BR>Traffic fines in
    Finland are based partly on income, and the record fine &#40;which was recently
    levied on an Internet millionaire&#41; was over $100,000... for going &#91;the
    equivalent of&#93; 45 mph in a 30 mph zone... on a motorcycle!! <BR> <BR>&#62;
    What SHOULD a font be priced at? <BR> <BR>A combination of three things: <BR>1.
    What the designer wants to charge for it. <BR>2. What the market wants the price
    to be. <BR>3. What the customer can justify to himself. <BR> <BR>In the current
    commercialware world, it&#39;s too much of #1, not enough of #3, and -most significantly-
    &#42;nothing&#42; from #3, the most important one &#40;considering piracy is so
    easy and widespread/accepted&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: BJ, <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t see any good reasons for selling all  <BR>your fonts
    for a flat fee of $2. <BR> <BR>However, in general terms, what you&#39;re talking  <BR>about
    sounds similar to the yearly &#39;pass&#39; that <BR>Miniml offers, <A HREF="http://www.miniml.com"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.miniml.com</A>. Except it <BR>sounds like they will offer
    at least 12 fonts  <BR>during the one year &#39;membership.&#39; <BR> <BR>Because
    your faces are one-offs of the display  <BR>sort, perhaps you should consider
    bundling  <BR>them. If a buyer can&#39;t justify $10 or $12 for a  <BR>one-off,
    display face, perhaps they&#39;d be more  <BR>eager to buy a pack of fonts for
    $25 or $30.  <BR>&#40;Those prices are just for illustration.&#41; It&#39;s the  <BR>old
    &#39;bang for your buck&#39; equation. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be curious to hear about
    other successful  <BR>methods. <BR> <BR>//joe

  body: ' Joe and Hrant, thanks for the feeback. <BR> <BR>Yes, packages are the old
    standby I suppose, used by Fonthead and FontDiner, among others. It seems evident
    that Ethan and Stu have been successful with that method. <BR> <BR>I am a customer
    at both places, and I was enticed by 1 or 2 fonts in a package and I bought a
    set. <BR> <BR>I would guess that that method would be the safest, and maybe we&#39;ll
    go that way. <BR> <BR>Still, we are curious about enticing the middle of the bell
    curve -- the users who have never paid a penny for a font yet have thousands on
    their hard drive. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s like honorware: You&#39;d hope people could
    chip in a little bit, at least enough to make themselves feel good. <BR> <BR>But
    maybe I&#39;m expecting too much from people who get their fonts handed to them
    on a silver platter. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
