  body: "It's too hard to classify (for me).\r\n\r\nJust to give an information:\r\n\r\nIn
    Germany and, I guess, all over the world, some artists use lead letters for their
    ceramic artwork. Just in Germany I got around half a dozend of them as customers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The process those letters came through make it near impossible to trace the
    original typeface (unless maybe there\u2019s some ceramist around here).\r\nFor
    a similar look, your best bet is a distressed typewriter font."
