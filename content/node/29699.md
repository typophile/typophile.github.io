body: "A client wants to make a website and use one of my fonts.\r\n\r\nHe wants that
  his clients can make changes in certain documents on his website in the right fonts
  and print out the document they've corrected in the right fonts.\r\n\r\nThe client
  himself will put the fonts on one webserver. Further, his clients won't be able
  to use the fonts, other than to print out the document.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis situation
  falls into a grey area.\r\nPresently, my EULA does not allow editing and printing
  of documents from an unlicensed remote location, the idea being that this constitutes
  typesetting, and that as such it requires a font installed at that location, and
  a licence for that.\r\nHowever, it's arguably not really typesetting, as the document
  (de facto, a form) is already formatted.\r\nSo I am inclined to believe that this
  situation should be permissable, although it will require a separate licence, or
  an amendment to my basic EULA.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think -- is it a good idea to
  allow this kind of use, and if so, should there be a special fee for it?\r\nIf so,
  it would be a one time fee, rather than a per end end user fee (too much bureaucracy
  there). For how much?"

    font embedding permissions, as one might use in a PDF document with editable form
    fields. \r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the legal intricacies to say much more than
    that, though."

  body: "This is actually something I have been in discussion with one of my clients.
    I can't go into specifics right now, since nothing is for certain. It is slightly
    different because it is granting a much larger online use of fonts for printing
    purposes.\r\n\r\nIt will be (if I get my way) an online design service that has
    a good selection of real fonts from reputable foundries. Any user can use the
    fonts and then print to the service. From the foundries I have been in discussion
    with there will definitely need to be a special license for such use. It is much
    more broad then what you are talking about Nick, but the premise is the same.\r\n\r\nThis
    is an especially pertinent topic due to the larger amount of online applications
    being developed. When Google and Microsoft start releasing online office apps,
    it may get real interesting. I think there is a lot of opportunity right now.\r\n\r\nShu"

  body: "Thanks for your comments. \r\n\r\nJason, good point about the editable PDF
    form. That actually creates a conflict in my present EULA, which allows embedding
    in PDFs, but disallows document editing without a font licence. So I will have
    to address that.\r\n\r\nShu. If micro-payments can be implemented on a pay-per-print
    (pay-per-document x font(s) fee) basis, what you describe should be feasible.
    Or even a pay-per-time-spent-using-the-font(s) online basis."

    specified client and have additional fees, right?\r\n\r\nNick, do share the outcome
    with all of us."

    time, if not ask them to estimate the maximum concurrent users, and then base
    your license fee on that number of "users". '

  body: 'Nick, I don''t know if the following is at all applicable, but it might be
    relevant. Video game publishers were not making money in Asia because of rampant
    piracy. Then they figured out that they could give the game as a free download,
    but the players would have to pay on line a little bit to get the special key
    to open the door to the next level, the sword to slay the tiger, etc., etc. This
    strategy I heard is very successful. I don''t know how it is set up. '

  body: "Interesting idea.\r\nThe problem with micropayment, from a business perspective,
    is that it entails collecting, reporting, and paying of royalties, which is a
    hassle and an expense.\r\nAlready I am negotiating this though a distributor,
    rather than directly.\r\nPerhaps I should talk to the company.\r\n "
