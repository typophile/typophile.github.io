  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was meaning to post this in late May / early June, but it's been a crazy summer. I graduated from the University of the Arts in May, and since then I've adjusted to my first full-time design job while taking some time to enjoy the little things in life. 

Anyhow, I was fortunate enough to take Font Design Lab under the brilliant Mike Abbink last semester. I developed a Humanist sans serif titled Agio, and I'd be interested in any feedback or criticism that you wise Typophiles are able to impart. I'm not sure where to go from here...keep tweaking? Develop a bold weight? Discover the maddening thrill of kerning tables? I'd like to start on a new weight, but I'm sure there's room for improvement before I go ahead.

Attached is what I presented at my final critique. If anyone needs to see more to make a fair judgment, let me know!</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I'll cut right to the chase: exactly who will go out of his way to use this design? Formally it's a nice balance between grot and humanist sans styles (two highly ubiquitous genres) but even that's not exactly rare these days. So making this could be a great learning experience -and maybe that was your plan- but how much further could it really go?

It might be telling that you've been Abbink's student - I'm seeing the sort of genericity that Kievit exhibits. I for one admire a good deal of Abbink's work (not least NBC Universal) but even somebody who admires Kievit has to realize it came out over a decade ago (and in fact was started almost two decades ago).

I'm not sure what to recommend - certainly slapping on a gimmick to differentiate it is a bad idea. I would suggest thinking deeply about how to make this more you. Formal education is a two-edged sword, and the better your teacher the harder it is to make your own mark... Good luck!

What he said. It is good work what you've done on Agio, but take the chance to express yourself through this design before moving on.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is not nearly humanist. Modernsit sans with a few humanist qualities at best. I like it, but it reminds me of something (don't know what) which is usually not a very good sign... The above two comments could be right. Cheers! jasper</div>
