  body: Thank you Stephen, but I'm after a more modern/didone italic looking script.
    Monoline Script has the flavour, but not the contrast in the stroke (it's a monoline:).

  body: I'll probably go with Mike's suggestion, Giambattista, it has the finnish
    and stroke contrast I'm looking for. Thanks everyone!
