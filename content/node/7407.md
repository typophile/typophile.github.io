    Sans</a>. I think they actually shrink the full caps instead of using the true
    small caps font.

    of for doing that. Ugly typography, this. Look at that lc c in relation to the
    cap one... What did the designer of this THINK when he &#34;crafted&#34; it? It
    boggles my mind...'

  body: I&#39;d bet they only licensed one weight thinking they could perform all
    needed variations without. Or ... and I honestly don&#39;t remember, they might
    have licensed it before the smallcaps were finished. Maybe?
