body: "good evening.\r\nI am currently developing the corporate design programme for
  a small industrial design company. As for the typography part, I have decided for
  \ a serif typface for body text and a sans for headings etc.\r\n\r\nI think I'll
  go for Georgia for corresponency (is there such a word in english? letters, invoices
  etc.), powerpoint presentation etc. There are two reasons for this. 1) i doubt they'll
  invest in a typeface family and 2) they give a LOT of lectures on different locations,
  and use powerpoint, so i need a typeface that's available on most computers.\r\n\r\nNow
  comes the point where I need some help. I'm looking for a serif that looks good
  with georgia, and contains OSF, LF, small caps etc. This is for the business cards,
  envelopes etc.\r\n\r\nAny sugestions would help:-)\r\n\r\nthank you and good night\r\n\r\nvennlig
  hilsen\r\n\r\nalex"

    But what garamond is shipped with windows? or does anybody have  a screen shot
    of it?\r\n\r\nthanks again,\r\n\r\nalex\r\n\r\n.........................................................\r\n<a

  body: "I'd recommend ditching Georgia for identity work. As you've already pointed
    out it lacks some features that you'll need, and pairing it with a second serif
    is likely to confuse people. \r\n\r\nAs for Garamond, no, Windows does not ship
    with a Garamond."

  body: How small are they? It might be wise to invest in a proper typeface family.

  body: "Word chooses as default whichever figure style the foundry designates by
    the basic names \"zero, one two, etc.\" Traditionally that was tabular lining,
    but some fonts now are published with proportional oldstyle figures as default.\r\n\r\nIn
    a Typophile survey, around 60% of respondents favored proportional oldstyle as
    the default."
