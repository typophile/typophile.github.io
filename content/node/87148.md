  in anxiously anticipating a whiff of Ashton Kutcher's latest brain-fart on Twitter.
  I just don't get it. I do the crossword puzzle in <em>The Washington Post</em> every
  day. With a pencil. And no Google. Thank God, the Post finally realized that its
  crossword puzzlers were presbyopic geezers like me, and increased the size of the
  puzzles and the clues. Hey, you kids! Get off that roof!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the world
  isn't going to respect my wishes not to be sucked into the milieu of up-to-the-minute.
  Social Media are here to stay, so I guess I have to get with the program or eventually
  disappear. How many other foundry/people are using Social Media as part of their
  overall marketing effort? How important is it to the overall effort? How much time
  to have to devote to it on a daily basis? And what in the world do you say on a
  regular basis in 140 characters or less that either has any relevance to what you
  do, or interests anyone who chooses to follow your tweets?\r\n\r\nInquiring minds
  want to know. Well, okay: one cranky old fart is curious\u2026"

  body: If you're curious about Twitter just try it. It doesn't usually bite, and
    if you end up hating it more than you find it useful you can just leave again.
    The thing is, it is its own form of communication, which is hard to describe outside
    of experiencing it oneself. It takes some time to figure out good signal-to-noise
    strategies, dos and don'ts, as well as whom to follow, but I for one find it very
    useful for quickly getting ideas of who's up to what, etc. And yes, many type
    people are on Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gabrowitsch/type-designers/members">Here
    for instance is Ivo Gabrowitsch's list of type designers on Twitter (231 and counting).</a>

    to Kutcher.\r\n\r\nAre you familiar with RSS feeds? I think of twitter as a short-form
    RSS feed. \r\nIt's a convenient tool to receive short interesting updates and
    news all in one place, instead of visiting a whole bunch of blogs and sites. \r\n\r\nWhat
    to tweet about? As a designer, I'd say most type/design-related stuff (even brain-farts)
    can be interesting to me.\r\n\r\nFor example: One of your posts in another thread
    would have been a tweet I found interesting/useful:\r\n\r\n\"One of the most comprehensive
    collections of information on PDF-related software\u2026\u2014 http://www.planetpdf.com/\""

  body: "From a business marketing to consumers perspective, Twitter (or Facebook)
    is simply a way to allow your customers to interact with you more directly. It
    also allows you to market directly to people that have explicitly decided to follow
    you...so you already know they are an interested consumer.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I held off getting into Twitter for a long time. In the end, I begrudgingly
    joined only to find that I actually kind of enjoy it. It's a relatively easy way
    to keep up to date on a lot of different subjects and interact with people in
    a manner that is less intrusive (or time consuming), than an e-mail.

    Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin.  So far, it has not cost me a cent so there is
    nothing to lose but your anonymity.  As far as \"which is better\"?  it does not
    matter, they are a tangled web that encompasses a huge and growing segment of
    society.  There are probably fewer of us geezers out there in Social Media Land
    than the younger portion of society but even grandparents who like to see messages
    and images from younger family members are joining the club. \r\n\r\nCome on in,

    follow me don't really want to know that I was out for lunch or back from CVS.
    I have also un-followed some folks who either over tweet their marketing message
    enough to be \xFCber annoying or post things every 3 seconds as in:  \"I have
    opened my twitter account.\"..I have just tweeted\"...I have just read the tweet

    enough, the factory was spared destruction until the very end of the war. During
    an Allied daylight air raid, as late as April 1945, it was wiped out by over a
    thousand heavy bombs, whose explosive power was based on Alfred Nobel's own inventions.
    A bronze bust of Alfred Nobel which was found among the ruins, damaged by bullets
    but nonetheless upright, was set up in the administration building. During the
    1950s, the site was cleared of ruins and used for building the nuclear power plant
    of Kr\xFCmmel.\"\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Twitter is, in general, even less private than facebook, as unless you restrict,
    anyone can \"follow\" you. You can take steps to wall yourself off in either,
    but that kind of defeats the concept. I think most adults, at any rate, are pretty
    circumspect about what they share publicly. But there is a trade-off in less privacy
    for more contacts. But yes, some people have a distaste for less privacy and others\u2014apparently
    a lot of others\u2014don't mind.  "
