  once heard that Ed Benguiat, when questioned what prompted ITC Benguiat, said, 'I
  was shooting for Times Roman'.\" \r\n\r\nIs there any other source for this, or
  is it strictly apocryphal?"

    you have to be dead to be on a postage stamp. I think they should put Jean Harlow
    on a postage stamp."  I will not repeat why he thought that was a good idea!'

    architect of Hitler's V-2 rocket, but after the war he became high-profile NASA
    scientist. When he was lionized in the 1960 biographical film <em>I Aim at the
    Stars</em>, satirist Mort Sahl suggested the subtitle <em>But Sometimes I Hit
    London</em>.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/I_Aim_at_the_Stars_poster_3666.jpg]"

    they come down? That's not my department, says Wernher von Braun."</em>
