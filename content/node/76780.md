  [[http://marketplace.veer.com/fonts/CTT0000496|now available from Veer]]. It's a
  classically-inspired stressed sans, with a calligraphic feel. It was a really fun
  font to make, and I hope you all like it as well. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/allpurposetemp_4952.PNG]"

    for the good words!"
