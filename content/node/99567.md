  two passions into one. Gametica is a simple board game for two to four players,
  in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to die
  rolls. Like other cross and circle games, it is similar to the Indian Pachisi. In
  my version on board I added icons on the board symbolize additional tasks.The 140
  cards has been added to the game with questions about Helvetica, typography and
  design. The whole project is based on the world's most popular font Helvetica.\r\n[[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Gametica-Typography-Game/6584875]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ninja-3d-box-web_3822.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dom13_4836.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_5039.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_Style
