    32 or 28 text faces been submitted? And out of them, only one single contribution
    proved worthy? Does that mean: bad times for Cyrillic body text typography?\r\n\r\nWhy
    do the private favourites of Alexander Konoplev, Maxim Zhukov et al. appear under
    \u201Cthe Jury selction\u201D?"

  body: "To Andreas\r\nThe contest had no admission fee and we expected too many amateur
    entries. That is why we did judging in 2 stages. On the first stage Selection
    Committee did filtering evidently weak designs and entries that did not fit formal
    rules (date of release and etc.) \r\nPersonal favorites were selected from the
    works that were already selected by the jury collectively. It's just a way to
    indicate the personal taste of the jury members. \r\n\r\nEmil \r\nParaType"

  body: What? He who makes the contest makes the rules for that contest. I don't see
    the problem in the contest organizers divulging whatever information they want
    to afterwards. I don't see the problem in their keeping anything secret, either.
    I am not sure that contest organizers owe contest participants anything, especially
    if the contest has no fees.

  body: "To Andreas\r\nI agree with you in both. That is why we publicized rules together
    with call for entries where we wrote about Selection committee and even listed
    the names of it members. We have not wrote details of the procedure because we
    thought is was evident that if beside jury there is a Selection Committee it will
    do some kind of selection.\r\nAnd to the second question. We sent input confirmations
    by e-mail to all participants. The last week before deadline on the home page
    of our site we placed an announcement to all participants \u2014 if you have not
    got confirmation it means that we have not got you entry. Try to send it once
    more or contact us with other means. \r\n"
