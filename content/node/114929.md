  body: "The letters /d f o v w/ look weird because they violate pen logic, i.e.,
    the placement of thick and thin diagonals is inverted. Likewise, the orientation
    of the semi-serifs seems haphazard; I imagine making them consistent (to the left
    on top, to the right on the bottom) would help the font find its rhythm.\r\n\r\nThe
    small ball terminals in /c e g s y/ and, to a lesser degree, in /a f j/, look
    like they'd benefit from a bit more weight.\r\n\r\nThe /t looks like it's about
    to fall over. The /z feels out of place."
