  \ if you guys could help me out with this logo. I whipped it up, the guy loves it,
  but it needs some touching up. Any suggestions?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moodog_media_6430.jpg]"

  body: "I'm not sure what the relavance of the bull shape as shadow is, but I like
    that part. I assume thats indicatig a balance between subtle and aggressive solutions.
    The very first thing that caught my eye, however,  was the lack of eyes on the
    dog. I just kept seeing it as a symbol of blindness. Maybe its supposed to be
    a silhouette but being outlined gives a different effect. The type placement in
    relation to the image seems a bit tricky, but probably not far off.\r\n\r\nStephen

  body: I love the idea. One thing that the dog shape is becoming is the mtv2 logo
    almost. I might try getting rid of the stroke on the dog and spacing out the legs
    to make the shape stronger. I might also change the dog so that it is panting
    or something, just so that it isn't faceless like Stephen said. ;D good coprorate
    colors.

  body: "the line weight on the dog is weak and makes it feel like clip art. I would
    get rid of the outline altogether and keep it a silhouette like the shadow. Also
    maybe give it a short tail.\r\n\r\nStephen...I assume the bull = cow = 'moo'.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    can't resist pointing out [[http://www.community-newspapers.com/archives/cupertinocourier/02.09.00/gifs/apple-0006.jpg|the
    original cowdog]].\r\n\r\n"

  body: ' i agrre agout the tail and eyes, i think the bull has a lot more shape than
    the dog so simplifying wouldnt go a miss, and can you get the dogs ears up to
    contrast the out the bulls horns. '

  body: "can I suggest you use the silhouette of the dog that is simply coloured like
    a cow (rather than relying on the shadow to provide the \"story\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nhow
    about a barking dog ... but instead of WOOF! it's says MOO! Or indeed flip that
    idea on its head ... a cow saying woof.\r\n\r\na person walking a cow\r\n\r\na
    cow with a bone.\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nit's a great fun name ... you should
    have a heap of fun with the logo too!\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br
