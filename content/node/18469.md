  potential demand for it is easy to see. Pokeresque is a typeface constructed from
  card suits.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how I'm going to do the numerals: make them in a
  similar style, or emulate the numerals on standard playing cards? Currency symbols
  are a related dilemma."

    to make 4 fonts? - each based on a single suite. Although i imagine this would
    be extremely difficult, it would make the whole thing a bit more consistant which
    was one problem i felt it had.\r\n\r\napologies for the terrible grammer of the
    above, it is late and i haven't the brain power to work out how to phrase it all.\r\n\r\ngood
    luck.\r\n\r\nGraham"

  body: "Thanks, Graham.\r\n\r\nWell, there's not much of any way to differentiate
    spades from hearts, as some letters require the stem, and other letters require
    its absence. And most letters just really blow when made from clubs. So I'd say
    it's unlikely. But I realize it wouldn't hurt to supply as many alternates as
    I can."

  body: "Well, make a typeface from card suits is a big type challenge. The structures
    that you take as a reference restrict some shapes and make some characters difficult
    to recognize. \r\n\r\nOne first hint is trying to use the card suits only as a
    real reference and keep the basic forms of the letters instead of force the shapes
    to fit in spades or hearts structure. It\u2019s will help you to solve some legibility\u2019s
    problems like in the \"U\", \"f\", \"g\", \"r\" and \"t\". The second hint is
    finding a way to improve the similarities between the characters. The \"E\",\"F\",
    \"N\" and \"X\" doesn't look familiar with the \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"M\",
    \"V\", \"Q\", \"R\", \"V\" and \"W\".\r\n\r\nKeep working, you will find the way.
    ;-)\r\n\r\ngood lucky\r\n\r\ne.\r\n"
