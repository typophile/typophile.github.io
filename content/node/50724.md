  body: "Hi Rskate2\r\nThe Posters come along nicely, just a few things\r\n\r\nThe
    Baskerville Poster\r\nThe letterspacing of the title seems to be a bit odd.\r\nCheck
    the last three lines on the lefthand column.\r\nThe bottom two's letterspacing
    is pretty tide\r\nwhere as the third one is loose. \r\n(same with the word Baskerville's,
    third line down)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Helvetica Poster\r\nThe space between the H and
    the elvetica\r\nseems to be a bit big.\r\nThe text needs some more tracking, all
    a bit tide.\r\nCheck Erik Spiekermann' s name, the last n.\r\n\r\nJ\xF6rg"

  body: "At the risk of being rude, what's going on with your copy on the Baskerville
    poster? It reads like text auto-translated from another language.\r\n\r\n\"The
    Baskerville typeface is the result of John Baskerville's intent to improve upon
    the types of is William Caslon. He increased the contrast between thick and thin
    strokes, making the each serifs sharper because more tapered, and shifted the
    axis of rounded letters to a more vertical position. The curved strokes are more
    circular shape, and the characters.\"\r\n\r\nThe right hand side fares better
    because it's just a quote from the typowiki, but there's the random phrase \"a
    larger series\" in the middle of the italicized text, in roman face.\r\n\r\nAesthetically,
    it looks like a reasonable homage to the period, but I agree that the letterspacing
    could use attention.\r\n\r\nBefore you fix anything visually, though, figure out
    what happened to your text and fix that. A nice-looking poster that presents no
    useful information isn't a design, it's just a piece of art.\r\n\r\nI was about
    to point out problems with the copy on the helvetica one too, but then I realized
    they were both just lifted from wikipedia (although something went weird in your
    copy/paste for Baskerville). You need to either pick a source with an actual editor
    or write something yourself that makes sense."

  body: "no, uppercaseH:\r\n\r\nyou make good points. First thing I thought when I
    saw Baskerville was that there was something up with the title. Then I thought,
    for a second, \"maybe it's just because it's not meant as a header text...maybe
    it's because I've possibly never seen it so big\" but then I snapped out of it.
    It looks odd, even the stroke weight looks a little off, but that could be me,
    who knows.\r\n\r\nAs for using a quote, even in a poster there should be some
    reference as to where it came from. I mean this could be a quote from anywhere,
    you will get more merit if you cite your source when using a quote. (Doesn't have
    to be full citation of course, but something) I doubt wiki address will get your
    much merit.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Baskerville is coming along, good color.
    I do like the \"Q\" in the background, just because it adds some texture, but
    why is it there? Does it serve a purpose to the poster?\r\n\r\nAnd a very small
    thing that is bugging me, near the bottom...the \"Jj\" looks a lot bigger than
    the \"Aa\". I think it might be partially because the J is sticking out. It might
    help to bring it inland, just a little. I mean 1 or 2 picas. (depending on how
    big this poster actually is)\r\n\r\nSorry if this sounds nit picky, but if you
    have a good start, why not make it a solid piece you can be proud of? :)\r\n\r\ncourtney"

  body: "No its fine uppercaseH I agree that I should of wrote something original
    for the copy on both pieces. Its just my teacher didn't ask for personal written
    copy, and I was feeling a little lazy I guess lol. But I will defiantly change
    it so something original.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really likes the Q in the background, I
    think it gave it some character. It is there because Baskerville was one of the
    first to Extend The Q-Tail, so I was trying to emphasize his motives.\r\n\r\nThe
    Jj does seem to look bigger, but its the same point size. It could be looking
    bigger because the flush left with the Aa and also its thinner and longer that
    the Aa also. What could I do to fix this issue?\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments
    guys,\r\n    Rskate2"

  body: "Yea, I figured they were the same point size. Try just moving it in a bit
    (to the right) Keep moving it in until it's visually balanced, I think you have
    enough of an eye to tell when that is. It will probably only be a few picas...very
    minimal.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree about the Q in the background, like I said, I like
    it there...it adds some depth. Maybe the new original type that you write, you
    can add the fact that Baskerville was one of the first fonts to extend the tail
    of the Q?\r\n\r\ncourtney"
