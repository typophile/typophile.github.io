body: I was surprised to see Process Type Foundry's [[http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locatordisplay/index.html|Locator
  Display]] on this box of Lucky Charms. I'm not sure whether it works or not, but
  I am sure I never would have thought of using it in this situation. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/luckycharms_3708.jpg]

  body: "EEK! it looks so weird!  In canada every package is bilingual english/french.\r\n\r\nY'know,
    our packages are cleaner than that too...\r\n\r\nSomething I noticed walking through
    American grocery stores is that, even thought they only had 1 language to deal
    with, they english-only packaging was WAY more crowded and busy than our Canadian
    bilingual packagine (and I'm also not a fan of american typography, much more
    'novelty' than 'style' for my taste.\r\n\r\nThe <em>only</em> clean and legible
    packages in the US were multi-national copmanies, whose designers would have had
    to design multi-lingual packaging in other countries (canada, europe) like Kraft,
    Knorr and others like that.\r\n\r\nI wonder, is our bilingual packaging in Canada
    busier and more loaded down than European Multi-lingual packaging?  I know one
    of the impediments here are the 'equal representation laws' that require english
    and french to have (often times) equal point sizes, even though the french runs
    20% longer on average.\r\n\r\nIt might be nice to have predominantly english or
    predominantly french packaging, with some bilingual elements.\r\n\r\nSorry about
    this whole thing, it's just so foreign *not* to see <em>le french</em>"
