  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey everybody,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a sans-serif with optical grades and I found that instances generated with mathematically evenly distributed values don&rsquo;t appear to be distributed evenly. I expected that something like that was going to happen, but I just wanted to see for myself. I&rsquo;ve never used (or even studied/understood) Lucas de Groot&rsquo;s interpolation theory, but I understand the basic concept. Is there any way of using his theory with optical grades instead of weights?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m OK with maths, but I&rsquo;m no pro, so please explain as plainly as you can :-)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Jasper de Waard</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>De Groot works quite nicely, I think (but fails when the thin weight is very thin*).</p>
<p>Suppose one grade has a horizontal thickness of 20 units and the other grade has a horizontal thickness of 40 units, then your interpolation must have thickness √(20 x 40) = 28.284&hellip; (significantly less than 30 which is the mean).</p>
<p>That means if you are interpolating between 0 and 1000 your instance is at (28.284 - 20)/(40 - 20) = 414</p>
<p>This will start to get more complicated if you have an even number of grades (e.g. 4) and just thinking about how to calculate that makes my head hurt.</p>
<p>Most will tell you to trust your eye, the final arbiter on the matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose your stem at the thin extreme is 1 unit thin (unlikely and not very practical I admit) and that your thick end is 100 units thick. De Groot will say that the optical halfway is √(1 x 100) = 10 which is still very thin so we may be looking for new maths in this instance.</li>

<p>As I understand it, De Groot&rsquo;s &ldquo;theory&rdquo; just describes the general idea that our eyes can distinguish lighter color values better than darker values. Interesting to those who haven&rsquo;t figured it out on their own; obvious to those who have.</p>
<p>As applied to optical grades, I&rsquo;d expect that you&rsquo;d need to make bigger adjustments between the smaller-size grades than the larger-size grades. But unlike weight changes, optical grades often also incorporate changes in width and x-height.</p>

Just something to keep in the back of your mind and consider as an option. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, forget about it, but I believe it might just work.</p>
<p>The matter of optical grades is in this case, slightly more complicated. They&rsquo;re not actually &ldquo;optical grades&rdquo;. They are build on the same principle, but the contrast between the to extremes is too extreme to be considered optical grades. They are no there to make things look the same at every size. They are there to make things look different, yet the same, disregarding the size. Off coarse every grade has a minimum point size (high-contrast at 10 pnts simply looks bad), but ALL grades work fine at display size.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">If you follow a geometric progression, the ratio of change is the same as you interpolate.  Since the eye is more capable at distinctions at the lighter weights, you might consider either a regular unit addition (or subtraction moving towards the light) to the geometric value to create a progression that ascends in rate of change as you move towards the bold.  This can be a constant unit or it can be a ratio of a unit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">DeGroot&rsquo;s theory is a starting point for interpolating typefaces that have enough weight to be easily differentiated from each other. In one of my projects I have not found it entirely relevant to optical sizes, probably because the changes are small enough that being a little bit off is very noticeable. Also, serif sizes do not always scale linearly along with weight/contrast changes, so you may need to adjust how you handle the flared terminals with another axis. Zapf discussed this in one of the essays that appeared in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hermann Zapf and his Design Philosophy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, see page 70.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You might want to rethink your terminology. “Optical grades” is a misnomer.</p>
<p>The use of the word “optical” makes most type designers think about size-specific design. And the use of the term “grades” makes me think about fine weight &amp; contrast compensations for varying press conditions (which this approximates, but is not quite the same).</p>
<p>Really, these are just different instances along a contrast style axis. Which is part of why the interpolation distribution doesn’t really “need” any special adjustment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->De Groot&rsquo;s method is just a guideline. Just something to keep in the back of your mind and consider as an option.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a concrete example of where De Groot&rsquo;s method will give you the wrong design answer.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a text face in a regular weight and a bold. You want to create a semibold. Some designers would just interpolate 50% and be done with it. Other designers would say &ldquo;aha, I&rsquo;ll use De Groot&rsquo;s method&rdquo; and calculate an interpolation less than 50%.</p>
<p>I propose that both these answers are incorrect. In actual use, both a semibold and a bold are meant to contrast with the regular. A bold is more useful if you need to emphasize an occasional word or phrase; a semibold is more useful if you&rsquo;ll have to emphasize whole sentences.</p>
<p>But the semibold &amp; bold don&rsquo;t need to contrast with each other. For instance, would you have semibold running text with bold for emphasis? No, never.</p>
<p>So the ideal interpolation for a semibold is something <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than 50% — that way, you can ensure that both semibold and bold are distinct from the regular weight. A semibold that&rsquo;s closer to the regular than the bold — which is what you&rsquo;ll get with the De Groot method — is not useful.</p>
<p>Which is a long way of saying (again) that the De Groot method — or any algorithmic method — can be useful as a guideline. But it&rsquo;s not a substitute for conscious thought about how people will be using your fonts (a process also known as &ldquo;design&rdquo;)</p>

<p>I wish (because that could maybe just mean Italic is being avoided in
favor of Demi*). In actual use, the Demi is usually made to contrast
with the Light.</p>

<p>Maybe. If the Demi isn&rsquo;t too dark (like I make them) and you&rsquo;re

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have never used a Semibold as the &ldquo;bold&rdquo; of Regular.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The difficulty I have had, in making multi-weight faces, is in putting the right amount of contrast between Regular and Bold—which is the primary weight relationship in a typeface, and something that should not play second fiddle to a general plan of weight distribution.</p>
<p>The fact is, the &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; weights of different typefaces may be quite different in weight from one another. Settling on the Regular weight for a typeface is an important aspect of its design, related to its overall horizontal scaling and the openness of its fit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Addressing the comment of Nick Job on June 16th and his comment &ldquo;&hellip;we may be 
looking for new maths&rdquo;&hellip;  In his example he uses an extreme example of 
starting a a value of 1 then ending at a value of 100, the geometric mean of 
this would be then the (square root of 1 * 100) which is hard to write on a computer
so I&rsquo;ll make it easy and say it is (1<em>100)^(1/2)  which ends up being 10.
Now take the arithmetic mean of these two numbers which is (1+100)/2 = 50.5.
So, if I get this right, the method used by de Groot would result in 10,
the incorrect result (as most would agree) would be the arithmetic mean of 50.5 
so why not just take the geometric mean of the arithmetic mean and geometric
mean combined??
((1</em>100)^(1/2))=10
((1+100)/2) = 50.5
((10*50.5)^(1/2)) = 22.472</p>
<p>Is 22.242 a more acceptable result, rather than 10 or 50.5??</p>
<p>If anyone wants to use this math please name it after me, just call it the &ldquo;Raybon Method of Interpolation&rdquo;  =)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Disregard my prior post, I didn&rsquo;t have the information when I wrote it, this
should make a more sense:</p>
<p>Interpolation Theory.</p>
<p>This has a reasoning in human perception vs the answer if a true engineering
result were given.  In choosing an intermediate weight of a typeface, according 
to de Groot it is not the mean (arithmetic mean) between the two weights but is 
instead a value slightly less than half way.  Numerically, this can shown that 
if a typeface has a value of 40 and the next typeface has a value of 70, an 
intermediate type face, half way between the two, would have a value of 55
if a strict engineering result would be used – this would be in error.  Human
perception does not follow the laws of math and the science of engineering,
perception is altered slightly.  The true intermediate typeface would therefore,
be slightly less than 55, say maybe 50 in value.  The calculated value of the 
typeface then lies along a log curve between the starting and ending values,
with “Extra Light” and “Black” being closer to the arithmetic mean than “Normal”
which inflects the most from the arithmetic mean.  The calculated typeface value 
then lies along this curve (a log curve vs a straight line) with leeway being 
given to the thickness of a front.  Also of note, the vertical axis and horizontal 
axis of a font comes into play.  A horizontal axis is more confined to expansion 
than is the vertical axis which can expand a lot more.  In the end  though, it
is the type designer who’s good judgment should determine the look of the font.</p>
<p>Where else do we see this “optical phenomena”?  We see it in the columns of the 
Parthenon in Greece.  The columns are not dead straight (as an engineer would make 
them) but are slightly thicker in the center.  The reason is, that at a distance human 
perception would view a straight column slightly thinner in the center but a column
with a slightly fatter center is viewed as straight.  This is the difference between the human arrived result and the mathematically engineered arrived at result.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/projects/perspective/parthenon.htm">http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/projects/perspective/parthenon.htm</a></p>
<p>Going back  to Lu(cas) de Groot.</p>
<p>His “Interpolation Theory” explanation is best explained here:</p>
<p><a href="http://typoholic.ru/type/interpolation.html">http://typoholic.ru/type/interpolation.html</a></p>
<p>Interpolation Theory Calculation Example:</p>
<pre><code>		End(s) Value 	Arith. Mean	Geo, Mean	Difference
</code></pre>
<p>Extra Light 		40		40		40		  0
Light					45		43.620		  1.38
Semi Light				50		47.568		  2.432	
Normal 				        55		51.873            3.127
Normal/Semi Bold			60		56.56		  3.44
Semi Bold				65		61.688	          3.312
Bold					70		67.771		  2.729
Extra Bold				75		73.360		  1.64
Black			80		80		80		  0</p>
<p>So, what does this all mean??
It means that according to Lu(cas) de Groot when designing a font, that all fonts weights should stray away from the arithmetic mean the closer you get to “Normal/Semi Bold” when you choose “Extra Light” and “Black” as starting points, this is the inverse of the optical illusion seen in the Parthenon columns!!!!</p>

The names don&rsquo;t really matter what matters is in my example there are nine steps along the curve.
Refer to this graph, I added Normal/Semi Bold to get nine steps.
<a href="http://typoholic.ru/type/interpolation.html">http://typoholic.ru/type/interpolation.html</a></p>
<p>Starting with &ldquo;Extra Light&rdquo; and going to &ldquo;Black&rdquo; the difference fall along a curve:</p>
<p>Light = 0 diff.
Light = 1.38 diff.
Semi Light = 2.432 diff.
Normal = 3.127 diff.
Normal/Semi Bold = 3.44 diff.
Semi Bold = 3.312 diff.
Bold = 2.729 diff.
Extra Bold = 1.64 diff.
Black = 0 diff.</p>
<p>See, the differences form a curve!</p>
<p>I am not actually into typefaces at all, I am looking into de Groot for a class

If you have two weights A and C and want an intermediate weight B with the same ratio to both A and C, you get de Groot&rsquo;s formulas.</p>
<p>When you do this approach for a series of weights, they look nicely balanced in relation to one another in a comparative specimen sheet, as each has the same proportional jump in relation to the next. Whether this is ideal for use in typography is debatable, as you see.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ray, in a well-drawn typeface, optical adjustment of the kind done for the columns in the Parthenon happens with almost every glyph. I think here on Typophile you are trying to teach Br&rsquo;er Rabbit about the briar patch. I understand that you want to get something that is optically better, but I don&rsquo;t understand why you think your variation is optically better than de Groot&rsquo;s, which is also an attempt to get optically good results. And I don&rsquo;t see what it has to do with the specific Parthenon optical adjustments in your link.</p>
<p>As I said, de Groot&rsquo;s method gets you an optically balanced set of weights, but the issue is whether they work best in use in setting type. That&rsquo;s where the debate comes in, and you don&rsquo;t address those issues.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Teague was indeed a product designer and from an era where production techniques were far more limiting than today&rsquo;s anything-goes world.  The difficulty comes in only when, what some of us might call aesthetics, is a marketing afterthought&ndash;it is applied along the production line somewhere just before packaging.
Type design is not product design.  Whatever the aesthetic component is, is an integral part of the design for better or for worse.  There is no &ldquo;Styling Department&rdquo; as there was in Detroit automobile companies who added a dash of chrome here or there to separate a Ford from a Mercury.
Whatever any one of us may think about the particular aesthetic or WDT&rsquo;s &ldquo;visual rightness&rdquo; concept is opinion based.  We cannot extract that aesthetic from the type the way a car owner could pluck off  a 1956 Pontiac hood ornament.<br>
We don&rsquo;t first design the type and then later spruce it up with shiny bits to add perceived value, snob appeal, or even a basic comfort level. Type is visual in its function alone.  It is not an actor who goes on to get stage makeup and costuming before playing his role.  If the actor cannot play the part well enough, he would have failed the audition.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Having a function is not the issue.  A car may function just as well no matter how ugly we may think it looks.  I am personally repulsed at the sight of today&rsquo;s Cadillac but I am sure that it operates quite well never-the-less. A car can function just as well within a broad range of appearances.  A typeface depends on its appearance.  If we change the appearance, we either change the identity of the typeface or change its usability in certain arenas.
The big difference, to me, is that we cannot extract the appearance of a typeface and have it still be that typeface.  We can perhaps change a few things like color and size or even a few details&ndash;enough to make Helvetica into Arial.  If we go much further, it will become something else and may not function in the same way. I can dress up a Cadillac to look like an airplane but it will not fly.
There is a difference between what something looks like and what it may function like&ndash;except when what it looks like &ldquo;IS&rdquo; what it functions like. With type, what it looks like is all that is apparent to the user. A typeface is not a woodgrain veneer covering some working parts beneath it.  It is not visible without whatever cloak it was a designed in.
My point is that most type designers don&rsquo;t compartmentalize the appearance of the type they are designing from the construction of that typeface.  They don&rsquo;t first make a typeface and then make it &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;.  What it looks like is not even intended to be &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; in the pure aesthetic sense of the word.  Others may respond to it as aesthetically pleasing or not if they choose. I may have a gut level aesthetic response to both a D9 Caterpillar bulldozer and an 18&quot; Stillson Wrench (both of which I would not call &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;) but that has no bearing on how well or badly they function.  Both were made out of the industrial production world as tools that are just intended to work no matter what they look like. A Typeface cannot escape its appearance and retain the same level of function.  If it does, it has become another typeface.
Everything that is visible to humans has some kind of aesthetic even if it is not intended by the inventor. Some things, like energy, electricity, etc., may not be visible but may function none-the-less.  Humans may assign a symbolic visualization to invisible items but that has no bearing on either function or aesthetic.
The Modernists found great joy in portraying what they described as functional as being also inherently beautiful.  Some anti-modernists dispute this vehemently  and heap great praise on what they call humanistic looking or others even proclaim decorative as the desired look.  Anti-modernists may claim that objects  admired by Modernists look too geometric or bland or simple.<br>
The very over-the-top “Artistes” (as Hrant might call them), go even further and proclaim that  what it looks like is really what matters most and how it functions is but a minor footnote.
At the other extreme we have those who see science and its language of mathematics as the supreme ingredient in every item humankind produces.  The aesthetic can then be measured by how well it fits mathematical logic as we now know it to be.  The difficulty comes in determining if the mathematical aesthetic was born after the fact of measuring things done that humans thought were beautiful first.  Or if things were later called beautiful because they fit the mathematical description well.  Since Humans created the objects, their method of measurement, the mathematics, and the criteria, it is tough to  determine chicken or egg.</p>

<p>No, as both you and Chris are saying, the aesthetic and functional are inextricably intertwined in type. But I think you can still assess a type for how well it reads, and on an aesthetic level. Because it&rsquo;s all visual functionality, both reading and aesthetics, you can&rsquo;t totally separate it, but I think you can to some extent in evaluation.</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re not talking about text of the same size that has non-size-specific adjust adjustments, we&rsquo;re talking about size-specific designs. I don&rsquo;t really care how a typographer uses the different designs, because I have no control over that. I&rsquo;ve always thought Adobe&rsquo;s names for their &lsquo;optical sizes&rsquo; were silly and ultimately irrelevant: I use the subhead fonts at the sizes at which I think they work best, not when I am typesetting subheads. They are size-specific designs, and should be identified as such, preferably with the size range in the font menu name.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about non-size-specific design features of fonts intended for different typographic functions, independent of size, that&rsquo;s an interesting topic too, but it is a different one. The fact that it is possible to consider designs intended for e.g. subhead use that are not also size-specific designs just indicates that it is a bad idea to conflate the two things in naming.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting how this discussion has evolved. John, when I said &ldquo;mouthful&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s too long, but that it&rsquo;s a bit of a tongue-twister, at least for me.</p>
<p>Chris brings up a good point, which highlights that there are different approaches to the problem of &ldquo;use specific&rdquo; or &ldquo;usage specific&rdquo; designs. At Adobe, they have called them &ldquo;opticals&rdquo; and emphasized the adjustment of design for size. At Font Bureau, they have emphasized functionality, talking about &ldquo;deck&rdquo; size, &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; text and display type, and so on. Size is part of the story, though not the whole story.</p>
<p>Recently I heard the brilliant architect [[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11954|Rem Koolhaas]] interviewed by Charlie Rose, and he preferred to talk about how a building &ldquo;performs&rdquo; rather than how it &ldquo;functions.&rdquo;  I guess the idea is to emphasize the importance of how people interact with the physical objects and space in a dynamic process.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the best word also for type: that you design it for performance in a particular role, or set of roles.</p>
<p>(I think Koolhaas' new Beijing building is an ugly monstrosity, but that&rsquo;s another matter.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;tailored by size and role for optimal performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think there is also a problem with &ldquo;use specific,&rdquo; though. That there is a pretty standard set of things that is done for readability at small sizes: larger x height, lower contrast, wider spacing. But the user might successfully use the type for a different purpose than envisaged by the designer, so it might be a mistake to specify a single usage&hellip;</p>
<p>Ok, not helpful. But interesting, to me at least.</p>

<p>Perhaps so. Either name is still much better than &ldquo;optical&rdquo; yet neither may be the better label to put on type that is specific to a functional set of variables not aptly captured in the current one-outline-fits-all digital type genre. 
I would like a term that stands for &ldquo;multi-outline&rdquo; that would combine both the usage-specific and the size-specific outlines rather than expect the hair-splitting nomenclature discussions to be replaced by an even more confusing concept for users to unravel. Users are often confused about when to use one or another &ldquo;optical&rdquo; size.  Perhaps it would be best to use an unknown variable glyph as we do in mathematics (x, y, z). Even better, we could use a common Greek letter like π followed by either a sweet-spot size like &ldquo;π-12&rdquo; or usage designation like &ldquo;π/subhead, or π/sh&rdquo;. The π glyph would become a sign for the whole usage/size amalgam and would be very short to add to a font name.  Bodoni Bold π/sh is using less space than Bodoni Bold Subhead 12.  The problem I have with using numerical size in the name is that, as you say, users may choose a size differing from what the type designer chooses [even sometimes rightfully]. 
The marketing folks might even buy in on a name less unerwhelming than &ldquo;optical&rdquo; ;-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a math wiz either, but the styles you show have little to do with Grades as as we make them here at FB. They also, by getting wider as the contrast increases, are not Optical Size masters.</p>
