  body: ' apparently, I got the image right, but the text is gone... <BR>so, here
    comes the brief: this is the rough sketch I did for a russian client, ang he liked
    the logotype enough to drop the suggested symbol. <BR>however, there are things
    bothering me about the overall balance. maybe you could suggest some tunings to
    make it look better. <BR>and the second issue: though there are only a few letters
    displayed here, do you think these have potential to be extended into a full character
    set? do you have any recollection of similar fonts? <BR> <BR>thank you all, <BR>
    <BR>george // cellsius creative <BR> <BR>P.S. this is my first attempt at designing
    lower cases. please, don&#39;t be too harsh :-&#41; '

  body: ' As shapes, I like it. What&#39;s the company about? <BR> <BR>As a logo,
    it might need to be a bit darker, but the &#34;e&#34; and &#34;a&#34; are already
    too cramped, so try making the &#34;n&#34; &#40;especially&#41; and the &#34;c&#34;
    and &#34;o&#34; narrower. The thing at the bottom of the &#34;el&#34; is too subtle,
    and as a result out of character too - but don&#39;t make it curl &#40;it would
    create more color problems&#41; - just make it straight. The &#34;c&#34; is structurally
    superb, just make the top-right curve more round and remove the slight flare from
    the bottom finial. <BR> <BR>I think it could work as a font. If you go that way,
    do something original with the caps &#40;maybe uncial forms&#41;, since your &#34;a&#34;
    is already unconventional &#40;and we already have a lot of boring caps&#41;.

  body: I like the Metsys lettering. I have done plenty of mods to Metsys myself.
    I took the liberty of  <BR>doing a few tweaks I think may help you in solving
    your problem. The Metsys &#34;n&#34; is really nice, I think it could really helps
    define the &#34;a&#34; as the rounded &#34;a&#34; you did is perhaps a bit illegible
    without the context of the rest of the surrounding letters. I would also widen
    the &#34;e&#34; and &#34;a&#34; as shown. Hope I was of some help.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1495.jpg"

  body: ' I do like it. <BR> <BR>one thing that strikes me about this, in all <BR>of
    its versions shown, is how the first three <BR>characters call attention to themselves.
    Because <BR>of this, and only in my opinion, the last three <BR>characters seem
    less important. hmmm. Need the <BR>right words.  <BR> <BR>&#40;pause&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>Because the &#39;e&#39; and the &#39;a&#39; have so much <BR>character, the
    focus, through my eyes only perhaps,  <BR>isn&#39;t evenly distributed&#40;?&#41;.
    Or in  <BR>other words, the logo looks to be only <BR>those three letters because
    of this visual  <BR>emphasis. '
