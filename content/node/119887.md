body: "This is mainly a conceptual doubt.\r\n\r\nMonospaced fonts where inherited
  from typewriters and mainly used nowadays in programming. The main characteristic
  of  a monospaced font is that each character is kept inside modules with the same
  width (and height).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mono_5049.gif]\r\n\r\nNow
  let's think we define a new module whose width is exactly <em>two times</em> the
  width of the base module. Like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monobi_4067.gif]\r\n\r\nOr
  even <em>three times</em>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bitri_4071.gif]\r\n\r\nWe
  could then mix these modules in a new typeface:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mix_3664.gif]\r\n\r\nQuestion
  1:\r\nMonospaced fonts are no more a technical need so, in fact, we are not limited
  to use a single width module for all characters. It is just a matter of convention
  and tradition, I would say. Is all this true?\r\n\r\nQuestion 2: \r\nBecause the
  modules we are using are multiples of the base modules, I think such a typeface
  would be perfectly suitable for a programming environment (although I'm afraid it
  could seem a little bit weird from a logical point of view ). Probably it would
  be suitable <em>for any use</em> where a monospace is valid. Is this true?\r\n\r\nQuestion
  3:\r\nIs there any  typeface with these features?\r\n\r\nWhy do we need all this
  in real life? Well, I've got some ideas\u2026 but that\u2019s not the point right
  now :-) "

  body: "Yes, some proportionally-spaced faces for electrical typewriters had a very
    limited set of spacing options:\r\n\r\nIBM Executive (the most common): 2, 3,
    4 and 5 units\r\n\r\nVari-Typer: 2, 3, and 4 units\r\n\r\nUnderwood had a proportional
    typewriter as well, and one of the typefaces for it, called Raphael, had sizes
    of 1, 2, or 3 units - just what the OP suggested.\r\n\r\nAs well, with computers,
    some systems displayed mixed Latin (and Greek and Cyrillic in some case) alongside
    Chinese characters, using one byte to code the former and two bytes for the Chinese
    characters, in a traditional character generating video card - and so the Chinese
    characters were double-width on the screen, matching the double size of the code
    representing them in the video card memory.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some Monotype
    matrix-case arrangements for the Hebrew language had only a limited number of
    widths, to facilitate applying vowel points to the letters."

    an old-fashioned typewriter look is desired.\r\n\r\nNot sure what use a bi or
    tri spaced font would be, as text would be difficult to read. Maybe for widely
    spaced headlines, but you can easily achieve that look through other methods."

    New with standard ligatures on is a vaguely unsettling thing to encounter in the
    wild. It is better and worse simultaneously and in equal measure.
