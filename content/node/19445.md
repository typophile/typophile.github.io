  a cirt :)\r\n\r\nPartly inspired by City, partly by Briem's Akademi, my goal was
  to design a display face working with relatively easy, blocky shapes but still challenging
  myself with Beziers in those curved terminals.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ebukva.cidamon.com/type/\">http://ebukva.cidamon.com/type/</a>\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions? Is there any extremely similar typefaces out there?\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry
  for linking; I couldn't upload the attachments through the form for some reason.
  (I'll try to get a pdf up soon)\r\n"

  body: "I really like the joins!\r\n\r\nThis may be personal preference, but it feels
    to me that your OSFs ascenders and descenders don't ascend and descend quite enough.
    If you have a good reason for where they stop then it's not worth quibbling over;
    otherwise maybe try extending them just a little.\r\n\r\nThis begs the question,
    though: how much should OSFs ascend and descend? I defer to someone with more
    experience!"

  body: "This is not only sufficiently original, but I think it's\r\nactually a pretty
    nice addition to the spectrum as well.\r\n\r\nOS num extenderness: for text fonts
    I'm a big fan of hybrids, where the bodies are larger than the x-height while
    the extenders are shorter than in the lc; this strikes the best balance in running
    text. But for a design like this it might be a better idea to be more \"dramatic\"
    (and geometrically congruent) maybe by keeping the bodies small (at the x-height)
    and making the extenders a bit long.\r\n\r\nBTW, great pragmatism in your zero.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "More, on the alphabetics:\r\n\r\n- Since this has an element of blackletter
    in it, I might do things like make the right stem of the \"h\" descend (and probably
    turn left instead of right).\r\n- The \"r\" is out of character.\r\n- The \"f\"
    is slightly narrow, but the \"t\" is definitely so.\r\n- I would encourage you
    to try a binocular \"g\", maybe Koch-style.\r\n- The \"s\" is leaning forward;
    instead of shortening the top bar, I might leverage the diagonal part of the spine.\r\n-
    I don't think the \"v\" and \"w\" are working.\r\n- The \"Q\" is da bomb. So is
    the \"z\".\r\n- The \"J\" needs to go lower, and might benefit from a top half-serif.\r\n-
    \"p\": unless you apply my suggestion of lowering and flipping the right stem
    of the \"h\", I would flip its terminal the other way.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\n>>OSFs ascenders and descenders don\u2019t
    ascend and descend quite enough\r\nSomehow, they look out of proporion when they're
    long. However, I started with really long ascenders and descenders and I think
    I overcompensated a little when I made the smaller. I'm surre they can be a little
    longer and still look proportionate.\r\n\r\n>>BTW, great pragmatism in your zero.\r\nThanks
    :). \u201Cl\u201D also works nicely with \u201CI\u201D in \u201CIllicit\u201D
    for example (didn't Matthew carted call these \u201Cpicket fences\u201D?)\r\n\r\n>>The
    \u201CQ\u201D is da bomb. So is the \u201Cz\u201D.\r\n\u201CQ\u201D is my favorite.
    I'm getting a lot of mixed feedback about it though. Binocular g is definitely
    on my list, along with some alternates and ligatures.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    one.  What program did you use and what letters did you start with? I don't know
    where to start.
