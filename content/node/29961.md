body: I'm a design student and am of course still developing my type preferences.
  I was just wondering what everybody's favorite typefaces and typeface combinations
  are. I'm sure there is a thread on this somewhere but I couldn't find it. It's always
  interesting to see what other designers like. Thanks.

    questions kind of pointless and not the best use of my time. But maybe others
    will differ."

    I'm guilty of having type moods. For a while I was sick to death of flat-sided,
    square sans. I licensed Stainless before the huge onslaught happened and then
    I felt like a sheep using it like everyone else. Now I embrace my Stainless and
    my Vista Sans."

  body: "I guess that was kind of my point. Since fonts are functional, to have an
    abstract \"favorite\" font doesn't make much sense to me unless it is the perfect
    font for the particular job at the right moment. \r\n\r\nBut I've never been one
    to play favorites."
