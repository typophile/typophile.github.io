body: "I am currently trying to identify a paper used in a book I own. The book is
  a 1971 reprint of Gibran's <em>The Prophet</em> published by Knopf. The paper is
  a rich peachy coloured laid paper which is quite smooth on one side. It has a peculiar
  characteristic that the shadow toward the spine of the book, where the pages come
  together, turns pink rather than grey, as it does on most other papers. It is quite
  a nice effect.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI attached scans of either side of the paper, despite
  the fact that it likely won't help much as colors change so much from screen to
  screen. However, if someone out there has seen this book and knows which paper it
  is, or knows of a paper with a similar magical colour effects, I would be very grateful!\r\n<br>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/peach_paper_3593.jpg]<br><br>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/peach_paper-2_6414.jpg]"

    had a peachy shade like that, and textury on one side. Don't know about the color
    changing, though.

  body: Thanks Suzanne. I can't find it on Strathmore's website, so it looks like
    you are correct about it being unavailable. For that sake I hope that this was
    not it ...

  body: "Here is a picture of the stunning colour effects on the paper. I have not
    noticed this effect on the papers used in other books. The colours range from
    peach to pink to orange.<br><br>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/colour-effects_4867.jpg]<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis
    photo was taken under a Solux 3500K Lamp. Note that this effect depends on the
    angle of the pages to one another more than the kind of light used.\r\n"

  body: "This color resonance is a quality that I've noticed in papers before when
    selecting stock for books. I can't explain it, but it is something that I often
    check in the gutter of dummies before settling on a stock. I've always imagined
    it as an effect similar to the acoustics of some rooms where certain frequencies
    can get noticeably enhanced. \r\n\r\nFor instance, there are some [white] matte-coated
    stocks from China that give off a very distinct blue-purple glow. I generally
    avoid these for projects where the predominant color scheme or the character of
    the photography is warm. \r\n\r\n-- K."

    if you could post some other examples of paper you've encountered with similar
    effects. This way people who are are seeking or avoiding particular \"resonances\"
    (I like that word!) can always check back here.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be nice
    if anyone else could contribute their similar experiences\u2014unless, of course,
    the internet is home to some <em>paper</em> discussion forum that I don't know
    about, where this question would be more to the point ...\r\n\r\nI'll post if
    and when I hear back from Knopf."

  body: "I'm not actively involved in spec'ing paper for any books these days, so
    I don't have any current or specific information. \r\n\r\nThe information for
    overseas papers was never that specific anyway. Each printer had a selection of
    stock on the floor that I had to choose from. Things like \"100gsm matte white
    -- Japan.\" I'm sure they would regularly change suppliers without indicating.
    So, the only thing to do would be to order up a dummy.\r\n\r\nOr really, you should
    be able to do a check on a single sheet. Just fold it in half and check the crease.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "No, I still haven't. I took it to my local art store and they suggested that
    the texture and feel of the paper are similar to one they stock at another store,
    but I haven't been there yet. But they were pretty sure the paper they were thinking
    of didn't come in that colour. \r\n\r\nCome to think of it, I think I tried contacting
    some of those museums David suggested, but I never heard back. I should try again.\r\n\r\nAnd
    as Kent suggested, there are other papers that have similar colour effects. But
    I've not found a laid paper with a color <em>that</em> intense and a surface <em>that</em>
    smooth, yet probably thin enough to run in my laser printer."
