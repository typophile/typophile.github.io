  body: "Apologies, it was not Pegasus (a rip-off of Benguiat) but <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/pretorian-dt/pretorian-dt/\"
    target=\"new\">Pretorian</a> it reminded me of. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pretorian_1_5836.png]\r\nNot
    a match to your sample.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/de-vinne/\"
    target=\"new\">DeVinne Ornamental</a> is also similar but no cigar.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DeVinne_ornamental_3652.png]"

  body: I quickly checked the original thread, but has there been any digitization
    of the original metal face? I would love to see one.
