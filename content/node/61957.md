  the 'W' in one of the typefaces. Thank you so much in advance.\r\n\r\nI'll have
  another link up shortly.\r\n\r\nFor this attached file, I'd appreciate if someone
  could ID the font used for the text in the bottom left corner, and the numbers.
  The face with the rounded 'W' is in the bottom left. I will have another sampla
  up shortly.\r\n\r\nThank you."
