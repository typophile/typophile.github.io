  body: Maybe try setting their names in something lighter? Maybe even use Patria
    for them. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s it, I don&#39;t really know what newspaper &#34;mugshots&#34;
    are, I don&#39;t think we have them in Israeli newspapers. Do they come at the
    heading or bottom of an article? Or maybe in a seperate page?

  body: hey meir, here&#39;s an example of our current mugshots. We usually run mugshots
    with weekly columns from our reporters. Here is an example of what we have been
    running so that you can see the typical layout and make a comparison between what
    has been done and what i&#39;m trying to do.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34065.jpg"

  body: why use a cursive for the e-mail adress. I think there if enough difference
    because you use a smaller font.  <BR> <BR>To make it more quiet, you can give
    the name the same color black, not an percentage of black.  <BR> <BR>The combination
    Patria and Folio is nice.  <BR> <BR>Nicolien

  body: i agree with nicolien about using upright letters for the e-mail address and
    applying the same percentage of black for the name. <BR> <BR>the main problem
    i&#39;m having with how your new mugshots look is that the name looks sort of
    like it&#39;s &#34;hovering&#34; in mid-air. Maybe try and move the name to the
    bottom, as a new line above &#34;Reporter, The Winslow Mail&#34;. <BR> <BR>the
    way you positioned the actual photo, by the way, is a big improvement comparing
    to how it looks now. good luck with it!

  body: oh yeah, i was gonna switch the email addresses back to roman. however, i
    like the hovering effect I&#39;m afraid if i moved the names to the bottom there
    would be too much white space &#40;not that white space is a bad thing&#41; but
    i would feel like there was &#34;hole&#34; if i consolidated the names towards
    the bottom. oh, and i like the duotone names, i&#39;m definately keeping that
    aspect.

    caps would be an improvement ... <BR> <BR>You were doing a redesign, yeah? <BR>
    <BR>Maybe you could show us how the new mugs look <BR>in the context of the new
    layout ... otherwise, it&#39;s <BR>kinda difficult to give you an accurate critique.

    redesign</a> our paper as inspiration comes. &#40;which is very slow&#41;. So
    far I&#39;ve tried to re-design the front page including the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26543.html"
    target="_blank"> nameplate</a>. I&#39;m still trying to figure out what to do
    about replacing the text type &#40;which is currently Times&#41; <BR>I like the
    drop cap idea. Do you think i should just use that for columns &#40;where these
    mugs are used&#41;? I tend to think that using it more than that &#40;except maybe
    in the headlining story&#41; might be overkill, especially because our paper is
    so small. I&#39;ll the dropcaps a try and post the results for commentary. Thanks
    for the interest and your suggestions guys!'

  body: 'Hi Paul, <BR> <BR>Much improved! I would still consider 4 things. <BR>1.
    The fuzz clipping on the photo. Try a hard edge with a very simple light shadow.
    <BR>2. The copy between the rules is cramped. Too close to the rules, or too far
    from each other &#40;fiddle with both&#41;. Do you need both? Would one be fine?
    <BR>3. The drop cap is ok, but you have many indicators that you are at the start
    of a story: Headline, Photo, Name, Rules, Etc. I&#39;d ditch it. <BR>4. This may
    make me unpopular, but of your two choices I&#39;m not getting good vibes off
    of Patria. Apologies up front Hrant. I know a rediculous effort was put into it.
    &#40;It could partly be the setting&#41; The trouble for me is not technical,
    it&#39;s aesthetic. IMHO, Patria lacks some visual cohesion. If this turns into
    a big side discussion, lets take it to the Patria critique. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy'

  body: '&#62; Patria lacks some visual cohesion. <BR> <BR>I would hope so! It&#39;s
    a text font. There are many details &#40;such as the dot on the i&amp;j being
    too big, the serifs on ascenders being different sizes, etc.&#41; that are consciously
    designed to help reading, but they can&#39;t be pretty as well. Formal harmony
    at the letterform level is not entirely compatible &#40;it might even be essentially
    <i>in</i>compatible&#41; with readability; a &#34;real&#34; text font <i>has</i>
    to have a certain sort of ugliness about it. In fact I worry Patria is still not
    ugly enough during deliberative reading. Check out Fleischmann&#39;s #65. <BR>
    <BR>That said: <BR>1&#41; There are things I still need to fix, most of all the
    serifs on some caps. <BR>2&#41; Critiques of Patria entirely welcome&#42;. But
    if you want to discuss the issue of &#34;necessary ugliness&#34; maybe start a
    new thread. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html"

    see your point about all of the elements together looking too busy. I really should
    lose the drop cap to make it all as clean as possible. I didn&#39;t really think
    Patria was ugly Hrant! But then again I like ugly. I mean someday i&#39;m gonna

    &#40;from the Critique thread&#41; and notice that almost all caps have short
