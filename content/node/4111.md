  body: ' Pretty nice! <BR>Probably use a font with less contrast, maybe blockier,
    like Charter? And tweak the spacing: &#34;RT&#34;, &#34;TY&#34;, &#34;RA&#34;
    and &#34;HY&#34; too loose, &#34;OG&#34; too tight. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: I still think the background images overpower the type. I bet you could strip
    out a few layers and still have a nice piece.
