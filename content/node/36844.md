  body: Maybe I'm all wet (an American idiom), but I was under the impression that
    typewriter output was monospaced as a mechanical limitation. The proffered image
    certainly doesn't show monospaced characters.

  body: IBM Executive typewriters from that period featured semi-proportional spacing
    (three different character widths). The same "technology" was later used by IBM
    Selectric composers (six different character widths in three adjustable pitches).
