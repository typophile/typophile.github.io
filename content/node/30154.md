body: "Any suggestions for Tintin fonts? I don 't need to match them exactly, but
  I'd like to evoke the feel of the books. There's the main lettering style of the
  body, a sort of slanted unconnected \"printing\" style, there's a more cursive style
  used in captions, and there's the titling style. \r\n\r\nI'd welcome suggestions
  for any of them."

    offenders, and they include the fonts used in the comics in their realm of \xA9-material.
    \r\nLast century a sSpanish outfit published a faithful rendition of the bold
    cap lettering used on the covers of Tintin and they had to withdraw the fonts
    from their site, even though they said that is was an hommage.\r\n\r\n(But all
    that being said \u2014 there are copies floating around the web\u2026)"
