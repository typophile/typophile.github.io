  4? They are using an interesting font in their graphics. I am betting it is a custom-made
  job - looks a bit like something Identikal would put out...(?). Anyone know the
  font and the story behind it? The sample below is all I can find.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nPAUL

    their site, and some PDFs, reveals it to be C4Menu and a lighter C4Text.\r\n\r\nGoogle
    doesn't shed  any light on it.\r\n\r\nRichard"
