  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all I need some advice.  Hopefully somebody can help. <BR> <BR>I may be offered a job to do a local yellow pages for seniors in the area.  The person that is heading up the project really wants me to do the layout for it.  Now all I got to do is get back to this person with a quote of how much is going to cost.  The problem is of course, I'm a newb&hellip; <BR> <BR>Well I aint that bad, but I have'nt had much expierience when it comes to hunting down and finding the right price for a print job.  I started to look for online sites and found a few that over instant quotes.  But some of the options still confuse me. <BR> <BR>I am basically looking for a book along the lines of: <BR> <BR>60+ pager B/W (newsprint) <BR>Glossy color outside B/W inside <BR>Binded <BR>5/12 by 7/12 (???) <BR>8k to 10k copies <BR> <BR>i.e. Your basic yellow pages look. <BR> <BR>One site insta-quoted me around $10,500 for 10k in copies at $1.041 a piece.  Is this good?  Around a dollar piece sounds about right. <BR> <BR>I went to a few places and 5 1/2 by 8 1/2 seemed to be the a standard size of some sort.  <BR> <BR>So basically I am asking for a little guidance.  Maybe somebody has done a similar job and can give me a few pointers as well.  But right now I am looking to jump the hurdles of this beginning process. <BR> <BR>Thanks for reading. <BR> <BR>-Fav <BR> <BR>/puts thumb back into mouth and curls up into the fetile position.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I pulled out the new AGA Pricing and Ethical Guidelines book to check this out. Their pricing guide is kind of all over the place, but it helps a little.  <BR> <BR>It looks like they price something like this around $2,000 - $6,000 for the design and $60 - $150 per hour for production/preflight set up, if you have to do that.  <BR> <BR>The wide range of their prices is supposed to reflect things like the scale and intent of the project (things like print run and how much money the the client is going to make out of it) and the skill of the designer.  <BR> <BR>On a project like this I would get a feel for how many different types of content you have to manage. If it's just the address listings or do you have to deal with a bunch of ads or make maps or something more tedious.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Comic Sans. Wow. You're not kidding. <BR> <BR>Phone book type is normally set very small (to save paper) and narrow (to reduce line-breaks) - so you'd need a font with a tall x-height, and no clutter. But in your case it's for seniors (poor insight, but good reading experience), so although the economy issue is still there, the point size will be larger, so there's less demand on the x-height. If you have the Multiple-Master version of Myriad, you could probably generate a custom instance of weight and width that suits you just right. But the x-height is on the small side (for this task)&hellip; In which case you might try is a condensed cut of Poppl-Laudatio, a face that has a  large x-height but also distinctive flares at the ends of strokes - you could even use it for both small text and large. I love Laudatio. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">you could try LeMonde livre or sans by Jean Francois Porchez&hellip; <BR> <BR>it is very readable in small, so for seniors in a few points over it will be perfect. Le Monde Journal was designed for being used under 10 pts, and LeMonde Sans or Livre is best used over 10.  It doesn't have  a condensed version though it has a narrow width. you can buy it at <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typofonderie.com">http://www.typofonderie.com</a></a>.</div>
