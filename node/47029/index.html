  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in indesign and have a special need that I dont know if its possible to achieve.<br>
I have a catalogue with 39 chapters (39 diferents indesign files).
I have a left and rigth master page.
Every chapter can start with a left or rigth page, depending on the quantity of the products.
If, as usualy happens, have a last minute product insert in the middle of a chapter, Indesign will reorder the next pages correctlly (left and rigth) until the end of the file.</p>
<p>Here is my question:
If I have a &ldquo;book&rdquo; with all 39 chapters and in one chapter in the middle (lets say 10) I need to insert a new page, Indesign will re-order (left and rigth) to the end of chapter 10. But the begin of the chapter 11 will not macth with the end of the 10! Because before the insert of page the chapter 10 ended with a left page, so the 11 must start with a rigth one. With the insert  of the new page the chapter 10 will end with a rigth one and the 11 will start with a rigth one (that can&rsquo;t be&hellip;it must be a left one).
Is any way to tell Indesign to reorder &ldquo;All&rdquo; book after my insert page in order to not have to do it manually?
Hope I made my self clear.</p>
<p>António</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a little while since I worked with a project set up with this feature. But, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that if you have the .indb file set up properly, with all the individual chapters correctly entered, then adding pages to one chapter should flow through to affect the start of others automatically, whether odd or even. You can even see evidence of the changes in the Book palette via the pagination.</p>
<p>The individual chapters need to be set up as Facing Pages, obviously.</p>
<p>If you have the Book.indb file already set up and it&rsquo;s not working, then look in the Pages palette commands to see that Allow Pages to Shuffle is checked on. You may need to check each individual chapter.</p>

Well&hellip;I have the files set up as Facing Pages and the command &ldquo;Allow Pages to Shuffle&rdquo; is checked, but it doesen&rsquo;t work&hellip;:-(
But your sugestion remindes me of other problem: in order to start a chapter with a even page (left) I must have the command &ldquo;Allow Pages to Shuffle&rdquo; checked off, dont I?</p>

This might do what you want. It was designed for books with chapters that always start on right pages (for example) but it sounds like your case is a little more variable than that.</div>

<p>Hmmm. I don&rsquo;t think so. If I set up a document (chapter), add a bunch of pages, then go to the Pages palette &gt; Numbering &amp; Section Options and select Start Page Numbering At: and enter an even number, then the document automatically starts on a left page. (Doesn&rsquo;t matter whether Shuffle is turned on or off.)</p>
<p>Allow Pages to Shuffle just means you can&rsquo;t create a spread with more than two pages. If you turn it off, then you can.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> &gt; You can try selecting the Book &gt; Book Page Numbering Options… &amp; setting the Page Order = Continue on next even page (or next odd page) radio button. That should allow each doc to start on an even/odd page regardless of what the last doc ended on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Eric, my impression is that António wants each chapter to start on the whatever page (odd or even) makes sequential sense after the previous chapter. But that he wants it to change if a previous chapter shifts.</p>
<p>So, if a chapter currently ends even (on a left page) the next chapter will start on the right (an odd page). But then if that chapter gets changed and flows onto another page and then ends odd (a right page), the following chapter will automatically shift to begin on the next even page (left). And so on throughout the document, shifting back and forth as needed.</p>
<p>This seems to be the perfect situation for a Book file.</p>
<p>I would say that for the situation I described, then you want to set Book &gt; Book Page Numbering Options… to be &ldquo;Page Order: Continue from previous document&rdquo; and also turn on &ldquo;Automatic Pagination&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s not working for António. How did you set up your Book file? Did you generate all the chapter documents and then assemble them into a Book at the end? Or did you assemble them chapter by chapter as you created the documents?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using Automatic Pagination, right? If you&rsquo;re manually setting the start page for each chapter, then that could be messing up the Book synchronization. So, if your Chapter 1 ends on page 25, and you manually start the next chapter (document) on page 26, and then if the first chapter reflows and adds another page (pg. 26), your book will have two page 26s &ndash; one at the end of Chapter 1 and another at the beginning of Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Is this what&rsquo;s happening?</p>

<p>&ldquo;wants each chapter to start on the whatever page (odd or even) makes sequential sense after the previous chapter. But that he wants it to change if a previous chapter shifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>correct!</p>
<p>&ldquo;… to be “Page Order: Continue from previous document” and also turn on “Automatic Pagination”.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hmm&hellip;My page numbering is 1.1 until last page (lets say 1.30) and the starts again from 2.1 to 2.12 for example. I can&rsquo;t continue from previous document&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you set up your Book file?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I generate all the chapter documents and then assemble them into a Book at the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You’re using automatic pagination, right? If you’re manually setting the start page for each chapter, then that could be messing up the Book synchronization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why my Book synchronization is not working. I use pagination start in page x because I make a section division (chapter 1, page 1&hellip;page 2&hellip;page n).</p>
<p>Keep not getting the files updated correctly&hellip;
Thanks in advanced for all the help you could provide&hellip;</p>

<p>I think the problem is indeed that you have each chapter starting with unique page numbering 2.1, 2.2, etc.</p>
<p>As you know, a book typically has odd pages on the left and even on the right, and I think the Book feature assumes this. So if you force each chapter to restart numbering with page 1, then the Book will force it to start right each time.</p>
<p>Usually this kind of scheme (1.1, 1.2 … 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 …) will only open on the right, using blank pages if necessary to fill out each chapter to end left. I think I&rsquo;ve only really seen this scheme used in manuals.</p>
<p>Given this style of page numbering, then I don&rsquo;t think you can get InDesign to do what you want in terms of automatically shifting the chapter starts right and left.</p>
