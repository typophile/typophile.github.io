    Garde Gothic Bold</a> with a \"little\" work.\r\nI'm not sure but don't think
    you'll find a font like that., is it a logo?"

  body: naa, not a logo, used in a poster... so I think there must be a whole typeface.

  body: It was probably done in Illustrator using the pattern brush and then tweaking
    it a bit. The letterforms are simplistic so recreating it probably wouldn't be
    difficult if you get the basic pattern right.

  body: "Apologies, I said it looked like Light Brigade, I meant Globus. And I just
    realised it only has an uppercase set. Actually, it looks like Avante Garde Demi,
    but the junctions aren't tapered on your sample.\r\n\r\nSo I've probably just
    confused things.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps the first reply was correct \u2013 it's
    completely geometric, you could draw in illus in 2 mins \u2026"
