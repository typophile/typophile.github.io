    to be, when it happens. Christian, you're missed up here. Sorry you couldn't make
    it. =/

  body: I found it interesting. I was present for the conversation between you and
    Stephen Coles, and I found it very touching. How much of a response or feedback
    did you get from Positronic Toaster from others?

  body: "If you're asking about comments on the development of the face, there were
    some other comments here at Typophile (which I very much appreciated as well),
    but other than that, I've just been working on my own.\r\n\r\nAs for the gallery
    showing, most of the people I talked to hadn't been to the gallery at the time
    I spoke with them, so I'm not sure what the response to it was."
