    geometric sans by [[Joseph Churchward]] that isn't available in digital format.

  body: "Hi, Thankyou so much for you speedy responses.\r\nJust checked Syntax and
    if you look closely some letters like the t and a are different. However i did
    find a black condensed version of Frutiger which seems like it could be identical.
    What do you think?\r\nCheers, Jenni"

    news item about the recent formation of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/blhd/"
    target="_blank">BluHead Studio</a>. Apparently, they are now working on digitizing
    the Churchward creations.'

  body: "A black condensed version of Frutiger seems identical!? Uh-uh, I don't think
    so. Look at the \"tail\"-less 'a', the single-storey 'g' etc.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely
    positively unmistakably Syntax, maybe a different digitisation, but Syntax for
    sure."

    of the san diego cover onto the site, i was actually looking at the cover of the
    southeast asia book from the same series which im pretty sure is a condensed black
    frutiger. and yes - the typeface on the san diego book is definately syntax! apologies
    for the misunderstanding and thankyou for all your help"

    it's [[Bitstream]]'s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=PG.107329.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=San+Diego+%26+Tijuana&sampleSize=32\">Humanist

    originals... http://www.irishdev.com/NewsArticle.aspx?id=1818 \r\n\r\n...or maybe
    not.\r\n\r\n> Prior to adopting InDesign, Lonely Planet found it challenging to
    handle the extensive language requirements of its guidebooks and other materials.
    The process required managing more than 50 customised font sets. Aligning font
    sets from authoring through printing led to heavy management overhead, confusion,
    and inadvertent errors. \r\n"
