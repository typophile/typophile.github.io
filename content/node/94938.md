  typeface in the attached image. The closest I could come up with is Penumbra.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BlueJays_Ad_3711.jpeg]"

  body: "Quoted from [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/hi_hi_birdie.php|this
    article]] at \"Brand New\"\r\n<blockquote>The new look was more than 18 months
    in the making. It was created by the Blue Jays with assistance from the Design
    Services division of Major League Baseball, in conjunction with members of Toronto\u2019s
    staff, manager John Farrell and several players.</blockquote>\r\nSo I guess, it
    has to be considered as an exclusive typeface for the Toronto Blue Jays.\r\nPart
    of that, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/elan/|Elan ITC]] is very close and
    could be used as it. But, the more I look at it, the more I think it's a custom
    job based on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/kabel/UniqueName-215863-116558/|Kabel
    ITC Bold]] (/S, /W and /G can't lie), some kind of \"Elan-ization\" (terminals
    extended and manually serifed \"\xE0-la-Elan\") of Kabel."
