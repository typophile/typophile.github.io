  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey people,</p>
<p>When I just started to get into typedesign, I was convinced that Myfonts.com was everything. If it wasn&rsquo;t on Myfonts.com, it didn&rsquo;t mean anything to me. As I progress I&rsquo;m starting to find more and more foundries not selling their fonts through Myfonts.com. Myfonts being (I don&rsquo;t know the numbers, but it seems kind of obvious to me) the largest reseller of fonts, a foundry is very likely to sell more with, than without Myfonts.com, no? So why is it that some decide to go for Fontshop.com, or any other reseller, only?</p>
<p>Cheers,
Jasper</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Perceived value is is one reason. though I think it&rsquo;s faded in this case as MyFonts has improved. Another is that FontShop (and perhaps other resellers) might offer special benefits for exclusivity, such as extra promotion, more prominent placement and display, and a better share of the retail price. You might also want to submit your fonts to a foundry, or maybe none of the above and sell directly from your own site. I outline some of the considerations <a href="http://typographica.org/2008/on-typography/taking-your-fonts-to-market-foundry-reseller-or-go-solo/">here</a>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The difference is: Myfonts is just a selling platform, Fontshop and others are font editing houses. When you want to do business there, you’d have to queue at their gates first and ask for admission. At Myfonts you just go and sell, thats it.</p>
<p>The second way is simply more handy. But it means, of course, that <em>everyone</em> can go there as well and do the same, so you have loads of rubbish mixing up with the good stuff. Personally, I feel that at Myfonts the share of rubbish is moderate and not higher than at Fontshop or other big sellers. It’s different with smart little foundries though, who can afford to manage their own sales infrastructure.</p>

If I had a penny for every dollar people spend to flatter themselves, I would be a very rich man.</p>
<p>MyFonts generates traffic. If you have a decent product, a lot more people will see it. More eyeballs = more sales. MyFonts also has the most generous profit-sharing arrangement around. Because of their increased volume, they take a smaller cut.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Not all type designers finish their own fonts. Many of them get their work to an almost-finished state and then let a vendor do other tasks, including expanding the character set, QA testing, family naming, and final font production. When this happens the font is usually under exclusive contract to the vendor. Exclusivity contacts can also get a designer a (slightly) higher royalty and a commitment to promote the font. Exclusivity deals are not always that great, though, as some vendors will just offer some extra promotion on their web site and regular email blasts.</div>

The (philosophical) answer to that question is so obvious to me I&rsquo;m having a hard time believing you&rsquo;re even asking. Not that I wouldn&rsquo;t consider selling via MyFonts, but it depends on the design and what I want to achieve. But first I gotta sell something in the first place :)</div>

<p>Making fonts (or anything) less convenient is a way to increased perceived value. But the Internet is pretty convenient already . . . the hard-to-get fonts are probably 3-4 extra clicks away. If you really want up your snob value, make people drive to your house to pick them up.</p>
<p><em>Most of the users of a typeface won&rsquo;t know how to use it anyway. If you can get a financial bonus by selling to poeple who don&rsquo;t know what their buying at all (Myfonts.com), why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</em></p>
<p>Oh, I see. It&rsquo;s the customers will not know how to use your fonts. I hope you can improve your fonts to make them easier for customers to use. Maybe think about an instruction manual. Mine is like this:</p>
<p>step 1: install font
step 2: type words with font</p>

Working in Microsoft Word and using Word&rsquo;s auto-bold instead of a real bold is one of the many amateur mistakes.</p>
<p>@James: This may be the case for you, but I&rsquo;m under the impression that whenever someone wants to share a typeface here on typophile.com they link to Myfonts.com (if possible), not fontshop.com. Anyway, I&rsquo;m not comparing Myfonts.com with fontshop.com. I&rsquo;m merely wondering why some foundries don&rsquo;t use both.</p>

<p>We give links to all our vendors when we release new font, so if you interested in first place to buy that font, you&rsquo;ll get it anyway no matter from which vendor. It&rsquo;s a personal choice, you may love FS more then MF, I maybe think the opposite way, a someone else thinks somebody third is the best choice and so on.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>I can say who is my personal choice, but that won&rsquo;t help you anyway, cause you already concreted your opinion that you&rsquo;re against MyFonts (in this case). But I&rsquo;ll just say, from my graphic/web/ui point of view, comparing MyFonts and FontShop&rsquo;s websites, as a selling tool = one of them is very user friendly and very easy to navigate, to find what you&rsquo;re looking for, to organize your searches, albums&hellip; while the other one is very not.</p>

<p>In addition to what Riccardo said, this also has to do with the fact that MyFonts’ display of <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-nQtxtd/?refby=i">search</a> (<a href="http://myfonts.us/td-YjJ22C/?refby=i">type family</a>, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-quadraat/ot-regular/?refby=i">styles</a>, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/alda/ot-light-italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/507817/263">glyphs</a>, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-721/alternate_cuts.html?refby=i">alternate cuts</a>) and test-drive (size, custom settings like color and OT features etc.) are better.</p>
<p>I don’t shop much at MyFonts, but might be one of their heaviest users when it comes to search, compare, tag and bookmark typefaces.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding Fontshop versus MyFonts, remember that FontShop claims to be a curated collection, whereas MyFonts will sell anything without considering it. Fontshop creates an air of class by only selling sub-par fonts if they can be passed off as groundbreaking postmodern experiments of the 1990s. MyFonts doesn&rsquo;t even do basic Q&amp;A on fonts. Pirated fonts have even been released through MyFonts with the original copyright data intact.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In addition to what has been said already:</p>
<p>Just having your fonts in these large catalogues doesn&rsquo;t sell a single font file. You still need to do the marketing to point people to your fonts. And selling your fonts on many different sites (maybe even with different pricing) might be even more confusing for your customers. And you need to manage all these different contracts, maintain the different font files they are selling and so on. A lot of work, which does not necessarily increase the profit.</p>
<p>But most of all: MyFonts might be the easiest and fastest way to sell your fonts. But if people buy your fonts there, they become a MyFonts customer, not your customer. They trust MyFonts and your fonts are just one of thousands of options. If you can afford to sell the fonts only on your own website, you might even make more profit in the long run, because people will buy more and more on your site and develop trust in your fonts and customer service.</p>
<p>There are plenty of options how to sell your fonts and what works for one foundry/type designer might not work so well for another.</p>

Everything is relative, that was my point, too. What works for you, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;ll do the job for me, also. Find your best way, learn on your own, at the end it all comes on that.</div>
