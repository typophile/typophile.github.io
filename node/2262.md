body: Is there a font closely slimilar to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-berkeley-old-style/">ITC
  Berkeley Old Style</a>? I tried myfonts.com briefly but it only suggested Cheltham
  and Goudy, which I don&#39;t think will be close enough for my clients taste. Anyone
  have some suggestions?

  body: M. Kojo, <BR> <BR>You are early in asking. Lanston is soon to release the
    difinitive version of Californian Oldstyle based on the lead patterns which were
    made by Goudy&#39;s own hand. They were, and still are, at Lanston. We  cut punches
    for Monotype composition. <BR> <BR>These patterns I believe to be the only in
    existence. The others were lost in  his fire at Deepdene.

    to see your version, Gerald!
