  body: "The internal space of the A is too narrow compared to the S and E. Also the
    S looks like it is leaning backwards and the transition of the narrow stroke of
    the A is awkward as it enters the lower curve of the S. The spine of the S is
    too heavy compared to the main stroke of the E. The upper left curve of the S
    is sagging a bit. There also appears to be a strange transition in the vertical
    terminals of the E. \r\n\r\nHey but what do I know!"

  body: "<em>...a strange transition in the vertical terminals of the E...</em>\r\n\r\nI
    would guess that there's an Aesc in there, and the tightness of the internal space
    of the \"A\" is because the angle of its left diagonal is aligned with the left
    diagonal of the A, and the fact that character is designed to be narrower than
    the mere combination of its putative components.\r\n\r\nSo it might be better
    to draw this lettering from scratch, rather than jury rigging/cannibalizing type
    forms which were designed with other parameters in mind."
