body: "First time poster/font creator here.\r\n\r\nI have designed a simple handwriting
  typeface for a project, it's not much but it's a key element of a brand I'm creating.
  \ I used Fontlab Studio and generated a Truetype font which works perfectly on my
  Mac and has been tested on a PC too, no problems.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I've encountered
  a label printer who is using an antique PC running Windows 98 which is telling her
  that there's a problem with it, but is of course being vague about the nature of
  the problem.\r\n\r\nI don't have a PC so can't run any diagnostics on the font to
  see what might be causing this incompatibility.  If anyone out there can have a
  quick look at the font file here [[http://www.mediafire.com/file/r2ozdj2mgdx/G&S
  Script 02.ttf]] and tell me what's wrong I'll be eternally greatful.\r\n\r\nI know
  the font doesn't look like much on its own, but it's an integral part of a brand
  I'm creating for a new client.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nT"

    it on a Windows 98, but I'm just guessing it could be a filename issue."

  body: Maybe you'll want to run your font through the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/FontValidator.mspx">MS
    Font Validator</a>. It shows quite a few technical issues in your font.

  body: The font is named with a numeral 2 in the PSName. This is out of spec and
    is most likely causing the problem. Substitute Two for 2 in the PSName and I bet
    that solves the problem.

    might have an impact on your end user.
