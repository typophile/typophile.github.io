body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've just graduated from graphic design at teesside uni (in
  lovely middlesbrough uk). =)\r\n\r\nI have now (finally) found a studio apartment
  in London, Harringey (in case anyone is moving to london don't hesitate to mail
  me with questions...it took me nearly 2 months to find something not too expensive
  and still in a nice area..so I might have some tips in case you need them).\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I'm going to start looking for a graphic job asap but would like some feedback on
  my cv first.\r\n\r\nAlso if anyone can be bothered I would greatly appreciate it
  if you could look at my portfolio as well for some feedback. It's a bit of a download
  but with the speeds nowadays I'm sure it won't really be a problem. \r\nYou can
  find it <a href=\"http://davdesign.net/work.html\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThank you so
  much for your time and help!\r\ndav2.\r\n\r\np.s. I have looked at other cv's on
  the typophile forums (and elsewhere) and there might be parts of text that are similar
  to others. I used these for the feedback that was given to them, but everything
  in the cv is definitely related to what I do/want to be doing and I have adapted
  everything to how I would say it. Thought I'd just let you know. English is also
  not my first language so that's why I had to do some research into writing an english
  cv."

    a screenshot of what I mean...\r\n\r\ntnx for liking it though (I guess that is
    what you mean with cool) =)\r\n\r\nas you can see I also broke the top line left
    to make it the same shape as on the top right....do you think that's a bit over
    the top and just a bit weird looking?"

  body: "Hi David, firstly, I really like your branding work. I especially like your
    use of strong colours throughout your portfolio. \r\n\r\nAs for critique, I think
    your typography could be cleaned up slightly. Here are a few thoughts that I had
    looking at your CV.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would say there are too many different typefaces
    there. I would suggest using 2 at the most, but using 1 would be even better.
    To create hierarchy, use different colours (which you have) and weights within
    the typeface.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would say the leading is slightly too loose and
    gappy. As a general rule, or starting point at least, I usually add 2pts to the
    font size for my leading. I.e. if my font size is 9ot, my leading will be around
    11pts, but then play around with it until you are happy.\r\n\r\nThirdly, I would
    say that in your bulleted lists, you should use \"space before\" and \"space after\"
    each point to create space instead of increasing the leading. This helps to keep
    each point together and easier to read.\r\n\r\nAlso, in your contact details,
    the \"p\" is capitalised, and the rest aren't.\r\n\r\nIn your portfolio, I would
    say that the reflections can be a little too strong in some of them and can distract
    from the work, which should be the main focus. \r\n\r\nAlso, (and this is my last
    point, I promise), the text at the end of the sections is quite large and quite
    blocky. Maybe try to reduce the type size and maybe just have the headings in
    red and the body copy in black or a dark grey? I think the line width is perfect
    though.\r\n\r\nI think your work is great and you shouldn't have any problems
    finding work. A last little bit of advice, and this is speaking from personal
    experience, is to not take the first job that comes along. You have good skills
    and a hell of a lot of potential, so think about what job you want and chase that
    be patient, and the right job will come along.\r\n\r\nHope this has helped? \r\n\r\nGood
    luck,\r\n\r\nJem"

  body: "Having to say you are passionate about design seems a little redundant. Isn't
    that implied? Would you expect resumes from people that were 'eh...I'm so-so about
    design'? ;0)\r\n\r\nAs such, I'd suggest maybe omitting the upper two right paragraphs.
    \r\n\r\nOverall, I like the layout a lot. Some suggestions:\r\n\r\nYour red heads
    are 'floated' to the left, but the grey ones float above the items. Seems a little
    inconsistent.\r\n\r\nWhile I like the typefaces, the grey headings are a bit too
    decorative IMHO. I'd use the body text face for those. \r\n\r\nI'd also right-align
    the 'pmew' for your connect info.\r\n\r\nSpell QuarkXPress correctly (99% of students
    can't seem to spell that one ;o)\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure how important it is
    to list specific software. I know folks have differing opinions on that. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "thank you so much for your detailed feedback Jem! Very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nI'll
    play around with what you said.\r\n\r\nFor the leading I just used the standard
    baseline grid in indesign for everything but the top text. That way it all lined
    up nicely, but I did feel like the text in the top could use a bit more. I'll
    play around with the leading in the whole document now though.\r\n\r\nThe bullets
    I just used a tab for everything behind the bullets. So everything starts with
    a tab of 0.2 cm. Thanks for explaining to me how to make the bullets look a bit
    more integrated in the whole and keeping it all more readable.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the P...how stupid can I be!! I think I've looked at it for too long...thanks
    so much!\r\n\r\nI'll see how the reflections look if a bit dimmed.\r\n\r\nThe
    portfolio itself is at the moment set on A5 high res print pdf. That might be
    why it's a bit blocky. The type I used is Dolly Roman (underware) in 8pt. I didn't
    think I could really go much smaller then that...then again the Dolly is very
    readable in small sizes. I also have the portfolio in A4 (that I will be printing
    as seperate sheets laminated that fit perfectly in a small plastic little suitcase
    I bought at the design museum (london)...which happens to be white and gray as
    well and I'll put a sticker of my logo on it as well).\r\n\r\nThank you also for
    giving me some more confidence in my work, I'll need that when the interviews
    start! =))\r\n\r\nin all thanks so much!\r\n"

  body: "aluminum: Thanks for the reply!\r\n\r\nThe reason the grey ones are above
    the items is that Responsibilities, Visual Identities and Promotional Items are
    all a bit too long to do the same thing... But I thought that as long as I do
    it with all of them the same it will regain its consistency again =))\r\n\r\nThe
    grey headings have now been replaced by the same typeface as the red headers.\r\nI
    don't generally like right-aligning things...do you think it would really look
    that much better (I will give it a try ofcourse!!).\r\n\r\nThanks for the quark
    =))\r\n\r\nvery much appreciated Aluminum.\r\n\r\nPoms: Thank you for your reply!!\r\nI
    know what you mean about the bright colours, but in this case I didn't want it
    to be too bright. I think I like the colours like this, they are friendly on the
    eyes =))\r\n\r\nThe type used for the red headings is the Tyke (although the logo
    type is the cooper...sorry about that). I've been looking into slab serif typefaces
    and I found the Tyke quite a nice one. For a while now I've been stuck doing loads
    of stuff with the Bello Pro and the Sauna (I really love them!) but I just wanted
    to move on to something else for a change.\r\nThank you so much for your feedback!!!\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: 'It''s probably just me who feels this way, as no one has mentioned it so
    far, but the line down the center of the bulk of your information seems to imply
    some sort of symmetry.  The symmetry is there for the most part treatment of text
    but not contact.  Instead of reading from top to bottom on the left and and then
    top to bottom on the right, my eye has the tendency to want to compare things,
    such as education vs experience, software vs freelance. Have you tried looking
    at it without the line?  I suppose the same goes for the text at the top--I don''t
    really see a reason for the different colored grays. The four pieces of text at
    the top seem to be related and proving the same point more or less, and I wonder
    if they could be moved closer together, though I am not sure what effect that
    would have on the rest of the layout.  '

    could also do with more clarity. 'Interacting' may be better than 'consulting.'\r\n\r\nFinally
