body: ' I&#39;m wondering if anyone has information on this typeface. A few months
  back I found a specimen book for the United States Government Printing Office and
  under the Fotosetter faces for the Smithsonian is Monotone Gothic.  <BR>Certainly
  a nice face, maybe a mix between extended versions of Akzi Grotesk, News Goth etc.
  <BR>A month or so later I was flipping through GQ at the store and noticed what
  appears to be the same face. A custom job? Maybe. <BR>Does this ring a bell with
  anyone? <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Eric '

  body: Eric, <BR> <BR>It is nice. FontShop&#39;s FontBook calls it a Berthold <BR>BQ
    face, designed by Benton in 1908. I don&#39;t see <BR>it available at www.bertholdtypes.com.
    One could <BR>assume that FontShop offers it at www.fontshop.com.&#42; <BR> <BR>For
    those who want to see what Monotone looks like <BR>it could be best described
    as a face between Trade <BR>Gothic and Trade Gothic Extended. Sort of a Trade
    <BR>Gothic Semi-Wide.  <BR> <BR>&#40;<A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4454.html"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4454.html</A>&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;But
    I refuse to check. They&#39;ve redesigned the site  <BR>and added all the fonts
    they sell, but it&#39;s in complete  <BR>disarray. Hopefully it&#39;s still under
    development,  <BR>because at this rate it&#39;s lightyears behind www.fontfont.de  <BR>which
    is fast, clear, and lacks silly frames. <BR> <BR>Stephen

    book.\r\n\r\nI like this font and highlight it on searches in the specimen book
    every few years."

    something similar at my designbookstore.com project a long time ago! I have bought
    a few 'evil' type books since! \r\n\r\njpad - see image Scan is from my Berthold
    catalogue 1989. (motter alustyle is nice isn't it?) Good luck in your investigations.\r\n\r\nYou
    can tell by 8 different letters that this font is worth hunting down for a full
