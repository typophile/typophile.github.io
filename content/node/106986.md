    We\u2019ve spoken to some users who have upgraded to Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks,
    and they work with FontLab Studio 5.1.4 just like before. "

  body: Adam, your response implies that Fontlab didn't do internal testing... did
    you? There was no answer to a similar [[http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=8927.0|question]]

  body: "We've done some internal testing, with positive results. Moreover, we rely
    on actual users' findings which are more valuable since they are based on real-world
    scenarios. \r\n\r\nSo currently I can say: we believe FontLab Studio 5.1.4 is
    compatible with Mac OS X 10.9, and no users have so far reported any compatibility
    problems.\r\n\r\nPs. As for 3rd party products such as Python macros, we also
    have received no complaints, but I recommend consulting with the vendor of the
    3rd party product for a definitive answer. "

  body: "Adam, I found something that I consider a bug with Mavericks and Studio 5.1.4.
    I downloaded the latest drive of my bamboo tablet so that it can work for Mavericks.
    The Tablet works just fine like before on every Adobe products except in Studio
    5.1.4. The screen shifts while you approach to the tablet on a glyph window. And
    I tried every single option on the tablet. Since this \u201Cartwork area shifting\u201D
    problem occurs only in Studio but not in any other vector based softwares I feel
    like there is an incompatibility. If I can't fix this I'm going to revert to the
    previous operating system and get rid of mavericks."

    It does the same thing in Mtn. Lion though, so not sure if it''s specific to Mavericks
    or the last couple of OS updates. Both wacom tablets used to work fine w/ out
    this artwork shifting area problem (worked OK on Lion). '
