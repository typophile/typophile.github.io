body: "I'm an American working in an ad firm in Birmingham, AL.\r\n\r\nBasically,
  i'm looking for an established British typographer to work with and learn from.
  I worked with Rick Valicenti of Thirst (Chicago) for a semester, and he cultivated
  a love of typography in me. I learned more in one semester with Rick then i did
  in five years at university. I'd like to get a similar experience with type design.\r\n\r\nGrad
  school is a little out-of-reach, and i feel like a working internship would be more
  practical anyway. \r\n\r\nI'm enthusiastic about drawing type and creating faces,
  but without formal instruction i feel like i'm missing something.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?
  Firms to contact? Type designers looking for cheap help next summer?"
