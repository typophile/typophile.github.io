  body: Glan, I like the literal ruler measuring device, &#40;first one&#41; but with
    a couple of changes. Loose the red triangle, the gray background and rule and
    make the typ 3D the same angle as the ruler art.

  body: Yes Daniel, you&#39;re right that it had to be simplified. It works, but,
    as felipe says, it&#39;s quite clich

  body: I like the red one now. A lot. I think it is tight in the square, but suggests
    complex and open thinking with the spiral-like shape. nice work, but are you not
    opening way too many &#34;fronts&#34;?

    of a measuring device

  body: quizas un grafico no es necessario.  use un lapiz y papel y tratelo mas simplificado.  en
    los que veo, el CO no se parece el AAT. <BR> <BR><i>i was trying out the spanish
    that i&#39;ve learned, as i don&#39;t practice much anymore... but what i was
    trying to say was:</i> <BR> <BR>Maybe a graphic is not necessary.  use a pencil
    and paper and try it more simplified.  in the ones i see now, the CO doesn&#39;t
    match the AAT.

  body: yes, i know the logos are very different between them. sad to say i&#39;m
    very undecided. <BR> <BR>obviously, i would show them to the interested people,
    if it wasn&#39;t for a contest...i find necessary to discard dessigns, and see
    the better ones and in which way they can be improved or at least detect failures.
    why do some work and some doesn&#39;t, even if it&#39;s very subjective. <BR>
    <BR>Yes, I would say messurement devices are in some way cliche -90% of architect
    institutions here use a compass in their logos-. <BR>However, I agree with scott
    with the possibility of represent those devices in a very subtle way. <BR> <BR>nevertheless,
    i&#39;d prefer to play with more abstract, suggestive logos.

  body: Gian, just free up your thinking and get away from the computer. Maybe look
    at the paintings of De Chirico, take a walk go to a museum. Let the design work
    in the back of your mind a bit.

  body: Ok, here goes the pre-final logo for this architects foundation. I prefered
    the hollowed cube form. What d&#39; you think and which variation do you find
    more suitable and stylised? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52168.gif"

  body: These are a big improvement over your first couple of batches. Of the latest
    I think the first one works the best. Forget about the one with the ruler. <BR>
    <BR>Try bringing some of the darker gray into the hollowed out cube to add more
    contrast and a sense of empty space inside. Fix the kerning. <BR> <BR>Nice work!

  body: I prefer the first version over the others also, and echo David&#39;s compliments
    of improvement. <BR> <BR>I like the positive negative play of the bottom version,
    but I wonder if you can try something a little more subtle than a dark background.  For
    example
