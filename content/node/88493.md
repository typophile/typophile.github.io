body: The accuracy of OCR software is barely a gnat's below 100% with any halfway-decent
  printed original, which is quite fantastic. But would it kill publishers to at least
  run a spell-checker on the results, so catching the "ii for n" and similar errors
  we now see regularly in self-proclaimed fine new editions of classics and other
  non-electronically sourced texts?

  body: If you think those are bad try looking at the crazy typos that appear in eBooks.
    Random misspellings, capitalizations, and missing punctuation are all common.
    I guess nobody ever bothers to debug the conversion software.

  body: Not to mention the Kindle (Mk IV!!!)'s inability to hyphenate at line-ends.
    Even their promo photos show the problem. I mean, come on -- it's a computer!
    Someone even put Unix on it. (Doesn't stop me using one though...)

  body: "When I started typesetting, the leading OCR package at the time boasted to
    \"have an accuracy of 99.9%\". Even if that claim were true, I <em>know</em>  from
    experience I make less than one single error per page when manually keying in
    2,000 characters-a-page. I used to drive the proofreader crazy, making her wonder
    what she was gettin' paid for.\r\n\r\nAh ... perfect OCR ... once a promise for
    the future, and now it still is. Perhaps speaking into your iDevice and relying
    on speech-to-text is more reliable."

  body: My gripe isn't with the quality of OCR (it's good beyond my wildest expectation)
    but with the willingness of publishers to put their name to the few but distracting
    errors which occur. Any OCR'd book was presumably adequately copy-edited and proof-read
    in the original, which dates from 'back in the day', so we don't really need to
    repeat that unless taking issue with anachronistic punctuation etc., all we really
    have to worry about is mis-read characters in the OCR process. These invariably
    result in gibberish; it doesn't need a skilled proof-reader to fix them, just
    anyone who knows how to use a spell-checker, and probably 1/10th of the time that
    proof-reading would take. I suspect the smaller and more specialised the publisher,
    the better this gets done, because their reputation is more sensitive to quality;
    certainly mine will be, and I take a lot of care over it. Of course my time is
    free while I have the day job. But I don't buy cost as the problem for larger
    publishers, just the fact that no-one gives a damn, because repeat business is
    not at risk; the reader won't generally know or care who the publisher is.

  body: I remember estimating typesetting jobs in the 80s, and we worked on the basis
    that proofreading was 50% of the cost of the data entry. Scanning at 99% accuracy
    meant we still had to find the 20 errors per page it left, so that cost was not
    eliminated.Hard to explain to the scanner salesman why their $75,000 scanning
    systems were not attractive to our little shop that paid less than $10 an hour
    to a good proofreader.

  body: $75K! Clearly made sense at that time to do without and type it all in. My
    'system' cost me about 0.2% of that in real terms. But for that, I do have to
    provide the motive power myself, typically at about 250 pages/hr., unless (rarely)
    I can sacrifice the book and put it through a sheet feeder.
