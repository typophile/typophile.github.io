  and I'm wondering if you can save the \"playlist\" like collections. I think you
  can save and load a \"configuration,\" but I can't get it to work.\r\n\r\nI want
  to organize a collection of fonts by genre, and load the configurations onto two
  other machine that share the same font library.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"
