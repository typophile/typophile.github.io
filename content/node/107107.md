body: I'm total noob when it comes to fonts but my eyes hurt every time I look on
  MS Sans Serif. My issue is with spacing/kerning before "lower case i with acute"
  letter - there's just too much space. See attached sample (MS Sans Serif, 8 px).
  Is something like that normal/tolerable or is this a bug?
