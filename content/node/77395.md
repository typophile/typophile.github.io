    Berlin, [[http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftgiessereien/Woellmer/WWoellmer.pdf|around
    1903]]) and the Grotesk of Ferdinand Theinhardt, sold under the name of Akzidenz
    Grotesk (Berthold A. G., Berlin)."

  body: "Interesting, JanekZ. <strong>K</strong>onsul looks like an exact match. What\u2019s
    the source of your sample?\r\n\r\nAssuming that Consul and Konsul are the same
    typeface with some alternate letters*, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a Jugendstil/Art
    Nouveau/Wiener Secession inspired typeface (also see the a, f and g of your sample).
    Which in turn would imply that it could not have appeared till the late 1890s
    or the early 1900s.\r\n\r\n* the only picture I could find online, of \xABHalbfette
    Consul I | Klassische Form\xBB:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ff-dagny_inspiration_3_3516.jpg]\r\nlink:
