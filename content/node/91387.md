  body: "What you posted isn't a font, but, like just about all automobile insignia,
    a custom-designed nameplate - this one for Maserati, as seen in the full image:
    http://tinyurl.com/7bxc444\r\n\r\nRiccardo's link will lead you to some similar
    designs; you could also google images for 'connected fonts' - which will lead
    to a few more as well as many that aren't connected at the bottom.\r\n\r\nSome
    harder to find ones include Javelin (Red Rooster) BPScript (free), SF Americana
    Dreams (Free from Shyfonts), Rocket Script (free)."
