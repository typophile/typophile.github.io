body: "In 1910, the German foundries D. Stempel AG, Gebr. Klingspor, Ludwig & Mayer
  and J. G. Schelter & Giesecke used the same EULAs or rather the same Terms and Conditions
  of Sale concerning hot-metal composition foundry type (which at that time was sold
  by weight or by bill of fount). Here are some examples of what was allowed and what
  was forbidden:\r\n\r\nWhat was allowed?\r\n\r\n1) It was allowed to use the foundry
  type to typeset letterpress texts and to print the typeset text directly by letterpress
  (relief printing).\r\n\r\n2) It was allowed to make stereotypes and electrotypes
  of the typeset text and to print the stereotyped and electrotyped typeset text by
  letterpress.\r\n\r\nWhat was forbidden?\r\n\r\n1) It was forbidden to make photographs
  as such of the typeset text.\r\n\r\n2) It was forbidden to make rubber stamps on
  the basis of the foundry type.\r\n\r\n3) It was forbidden to lend or rent the foundry
  type to other typesetters and printers.\r\n\r\n4) It was forbidden to use the foundry
  type (or rather the photographs of typeset text) for making printing plates for
  lithography (offset printing).\r\n\r\n5) It was forbidden to use the foundry type
  (or rather the photographs of typeset text) for making printing plates for intaglio
  printing (rotogravure).\r\n\r\nThe German text of these old EULAs is here:\r\n\r\n-
  www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/eula-seite1.jpg\r\n- www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/eula-seite2.jpg\r\n\r\nIf
  today's EULAs would specify that it is allowed to use fonts for printing by ink-jet
  printing and that it is forbidden to use fonts for printing by laser printing, then
  such EULAs would be similar to the EULAs of 1910."
