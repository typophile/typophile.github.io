  body: It runs fine on Tiger 10.4.6 and I have never had a crash - maybe you need

    start FontLab Studio and immediately (while still starting) press the Ctrl key.
    In the \"Reset Workspace\" dialog, choose \"Reset UI to default state\". \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam

    crash once after every restart \u2013 by selecting preferences/General Options.
    Can it be my Wacom tablet? \r\n\r\n/k"

    including Fontlab 5.0.2 after installing Tiger.\r\n\r\nI spent ages on the phone
    to Apple support before figuring there was a conflict somewhere.\r\n\r\nI fixed
    it by downloading a new Wacom driver from the Wacom website. Everything works
    fine now.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
