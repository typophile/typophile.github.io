  into a brochure.\r\n\r\nSorry for the poor quality of the copies.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  identify the larger font used on both samples. There may not be enough information
  for a exact match but if a font name jumps to mind it would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI
  realize both of these samples could be custom hand drawn letters and not part of
  font but if what you see suggests a font  I would appreciate your suggestions.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance."
