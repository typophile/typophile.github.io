  Sans by [[ http://bertiewells.bandcamp.com |Bertie Wells]]. Is there a pending class
  war represented by those that use Helvetica in their work and those that use Comic
  Sans? \r\n\r\nHere's the video on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsZGXf9ecoM
  \r\nHere's the song on Bandcamp: http://bertiewells.bandcamp.com/track/the-tale-of-helvetica-comic-sans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That the use of Comic Sans by the people who mess about with the Doomsday
    machine of any relevance is interesting. Would it be different if they if they
