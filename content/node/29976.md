  body: "Quite similar to \"Element\", one of the Neugotische Schriften came up in
    the (end of) 1920s/1930s in Germany. Some people connect them strongly with the
    3rd Reich, the nationalsocialist Germany, anyway.\r\n\"Element\" you could buy
    here:\r\nhttp://www.romana-hamburg.de/fraktur6.htm (search the list)\r\n\r\nSomething
    more - \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/neugothisch_4811.png]\r\nHere you
    see 2 others that were popular \u2013 Tannenberg and Potsdam. Other fonts from
    this categorie were, for example, Lichte National, Standarte, Deutschland. \r\nAnd\u2026\r\nThe
    red A is still used nowadays as a sign for pharmacies all over germany.\r\n\r\nT.\r\n"
