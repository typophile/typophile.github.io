    your previous sample included numerals and small caps, which helped in the identification--the
    entire thing just needed to be larger. Capital letters need to be about 100 px
    tall in order to run them through font recognition software. The fact that the
    sample was printed on paper that really soaked up and spread the ink (very common)
    makes things doubly difficult."
