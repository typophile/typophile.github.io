  for Hyphenations and Justifications. Is there a best practice when it comes to editorial
  layouts or do you customise them each for each layout and font?\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  for the best settings to reduce the amount of rivering.\r\n\r\nI think this post
  makes sense..."

    highlight justification problems is useful as a gauge of how appropriate my settings
    are. However, I always start with something like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/justification_6618.jpg]\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "I think three factors must be considered: kind of font, column width and
    language. Of course, tests and eye-checking is mandatory. For books set in serif
    fonts and using Portuguese I adopt:\r\n\r\nWord Spacing: 90 | 100 | 125\r\nLetter
    Spacing: -3 | 0 | 3\r\nGlyph Scaling: 100 | 100 | 100\r\n\r\nThis will produce
    more even spaces but increases hyphenation. As in Romance languages hyphenation
    is not an issue so annoying as in English (due to more regular syllabic construction),
    I prefer to priorize space distribution.\r\n\r\nAs a reference, Bringhurst advocates
    glyph scaling of \u20133% to +3% in <em>Elements of Typographic Style</em>."

  body: "I think glyph scaling is a least resource as it causes glyph distortion \u2013a
    very small one, but still a distortion. I use it just when other settings are
    not enough.\r\n\r\nAlmost all readers will never notice a 2 or 3% scaling. But
    I do and it's always possible other people notice it too. So I try to avoid any
    possible distortion in glyphs.\r\n\r\nOf course, mine is a quite conservative
    approach."

  body: "Word spacing from 80% to 133% is much more apparent and may be more distracting
    than a mere 2% distortion of letters.\r\n\r\nAt 10pt type, 2% is a mere 0,07mm
    which I seriously doubt anybody can notice with their barenaked eye. Especially
    when type isn't geometric. 2% can easily be visually distorted as a factor of
    other parallaxes. So a perfectly 100% type can look more distorted due to rivers
    of space than 2% distorted with better fitting.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents.\r\n\r\nBut
    it's true: God is in the detail when it comes to typography."

  body: "For most typefaces a Desired setting for the Word Space of 100% is way too
    wide\u2026 I mostly use a Desired setting in the order of 85\u201395%, with a
    Minimum set around 10% below that and a Maximum of around 10% over the Desired
    setting.\r\n\r\nI concur with Freibergers opnion that glyph scaling can be noticable
    and use only a 1% divergence there. There ARE some typefaces that can withstand
    a more robust scaling (eg Caecilia, which I often use scaled to 92%), but I use
    that in a global fashion, not on a per line basis.\r\n\r\nLetter Spacing has too
    much of an impact on the \u2018colour\u2019 of your typeblocks and reeks of cheap
    and nasty US-newspaper design (and a reminder that the Standard Settings of both
    InDesign and QuarkXPress have been hardcoded by US-engineers who haven been exposed
    too much to bad typography). A strict no-no in my book!"
