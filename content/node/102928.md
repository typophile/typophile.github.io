    Serif</a> by Peter Verheul.\r\n\r\nSee also <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/51601\">this
    older thread</a> (which, as it appears, I initiated!) on the font design, and
    some further ruminations on Dutch Design in general, happily veering off-topic
    :-)\r\n\r\nI searched for Rijksoverheid because I was thinking the font is for
