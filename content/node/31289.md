body: "Hi\r\n\r\nAny suggestions of what serif to pair Meta with?\r\n\r\nI'm setting
  meta as body and boxouts also straps and captions, however I want to use a serif
  for headers and pullquotes - for that emotional, traditional and authoritative connection.\r\n\r\nThe
  job is a high end tourist brochure.\r\n\r\nI'm using Minion Pro at the moment and
  fairly happy with the results - just wondered if anyone had any other suggestions??\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Erik Spiekermann himself has used Minion with FF Meta to good effect, so you're
    not off the mark. I'd also recommend [[FF Clifford]] which has a little more character
    than Minion and similar cuts specifically for text and headline sizes.
