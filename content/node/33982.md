    make \"ATAKO\" much looser. I would do a combination of 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I would have "AK" as close as "KA"  and then play with kern on O to the K
    and T to both right and left A to balance white space.

  body: 'Are you stuck with these letters? It seems to me you can make this evener
    with a narrower K and maybe also a wider T. For logos, altering the letters for
    even color is in order. That at any rate is the practice of Doyald Young in his
    Fonts & Logos book. '
