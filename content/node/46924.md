body: "In an effort to greatly reduce the burden on our catalog production staff,
  I am attempting to tweak an existing font whose bullet character is too large (so
  that they don't have to manually reduce the size of every bullet). I have successfully
  done this, however, I can't seem to get the name of the font to display properly
  in the font menu of Adobe products. Specifically, this is a font with many different
  weights, and those weights are indicated by a number in front of the name (e.g.,
  47 Light Condensed). In Quark Xpress, the name properly displays with my new font
  family name (a variation on the original) and the correct weight/style name. However,
  the adobe products incorrectly identify the font by the generic weight named assigned
  by Fontographer (e.g., LightCn). This is also the same naming that appears in Suitcase
  for BOTH fonts, the original and my modified version.\r\n\r\nI'm using Fontographer
  4.7, outputting Type 1 fonts to an exclusively Mac environment. I don't know if
  this is a weird adobe thing, or if it's something I've done incorrectly. I've been
  on Adobe's forums, and have found nothing there. Any suggestions and information
  would help."
