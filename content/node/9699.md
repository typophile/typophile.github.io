body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Anybody know where I could find a full character set for Victorian
  Stencil? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67094.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>This sample was found from the Solotype Catalog &#40;page 116&#41;.  And
  unfortunately I don&#39;t have access to the full character set.  I know of a freeware
  font named Maverick &#40;by Jeff Levine&#41; this is based on Victorian Stencil,
  and a grunged up version named Clint &#40;by Nerfect&#41; that is obviously based
  on Maverick.  So anybody know where I could find out more information about this
  typeface.  Maybe in a book somewhere &#40;or maybe even in some other Solotype catalog&#41;,
  or if someone happens to have any scans that would be really great.  Thanks!

    Victorian Display Alphabets&#34;</a> book, but Victorian Stencil is not there.
    It does have plenty of similar Tuscan-style alphabets, and so might be worth picking
    up for inspiration. <BR> <BR>Do you know if the Maverick font was based on a more
    complete specimen? I understand you want to avoid copying it too closely, but
    perhaps it could still be useful as a reference.

  body: Justin, <BR> <BR>Thanks for checking through the book for me.  I will definately
    buy that book.  Too bad Amazon doesn&#39;t have any in stock, because I&#39;ve
    got Amazon Prime now and I would&#39;ve received the book in two days. <BR> <BR>I
    think I&#39;ll get in touch with Jeff Levine, and see if he can help me.  I guess
    I&#39;ll use Maverick as a reference, maybe print out the characters and not get
    them anywhere near TypeTool.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    target="_blank">Stencil Alphabets</a> book by Dan Solo. I&#39;ve just ordered
    a copy, as it seems to be one of the few of his Dover books I don&#39;t already
    have. Anyone able to check and see if &#39;Victorian Stencil&#39; is included?

  body: Mike, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the link.  I ordered a copy as well.  I&#39;ll be
    getting it on Tuesday.  It won&#39;t matter too much if it doesn&#39;t have Victorian
    Stencil since I love stencils. <BR> <BR>Thanks again!

    <BR> <BR>P.S. Check out Billboard and Grocers Stencil when you get the book, those
    are pretty sweet too.

    off and the book had some good stencil designs for you.  I&#39;ll check out those
    others you mentioned when my copy arrives.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for following up.

  body: Lauri,  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s very generous. Thank you! <BR> <BR>It will have
    a spot in Part 5 of the Script Font ID Guide &#40;Designed Scripts&#41;. I know
    my definition of &#39;script&#39; is broader than conventional, but I have included
    Art Nouveau, Victorian and Western/Circus fonts in Part 5, since they appear to
    be hand-drawn, as opposed to straight edge &amp; compass drawn.

  body: Murray, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the link!  That&#39;s a very interesting typeface...
    almost makes me want to look around on eBay for old Ouija boards for the lettering.

  body: Tiff, <BR> <BR>I guess it depends on the type designer, because you could
    probably do some really wicked stuff with OpenType substitutions.  &#34;I am hungry&#34;
    could turn into &#34;I want to kill&#34;.  But I&#39;ll ask the spirits for a
    second opinion.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
