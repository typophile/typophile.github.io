  user -- trying to copy a character from, say, decimal char # 195 into char # 15.
  \ The fog file saves the change, but when I generate font (either ttf or PS type
  1), the change is not generated.  I need to be able to use some from ASCII chars
  0 to 32 as I have a printing system that only supports up to ASCII 127.  Need help
  badly.  Thanks.\r\n"

  body: "TrueType fonts cannot have characters in those slots. PostScript fonts can,
    but access is very limited in older Mac systems, and not supported in later systems.
    In Mac PostScript fonts, for instance, low ASCII slots are sometimes used by font
    developers to store Windows-only characters for convenience sake. But there is
    normally no way to access them on the Mac, and definitely no way to type them.\r\n\r\nWhat
    kind of strange printing system do you have which only supports 7-bit ASCII? An
    Epson MX-80?"

      the ttf and generating postscript type 1 and it also did not save it.  I have
      the font as postscript, too.  Maybe I should try editing that and re-generate
      a new postscript font(?)."

  body: I should clarify that, even if you are able to put characters in the lower
    ASCII range (as in a PostScript font), you may not be able to access them. The
    lower ASCII range is not meant as a place to put "normal" characters. This is
    where special codes like the carriage return, line feed, delete, and tab are found.
    Using them for normal characters will probably not work, even if you are able
    to make such a font.

      correct option on the Scitex software to access the characters past 127 (Roman-8).\r\n\r\n"
