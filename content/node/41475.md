  body: "Nope, not 100%, at least not one of the versions I have access to. The \u2018a\u2019
    is different, and a lot of other details (width of \u2018P\u2019 bowl, \u2018f\u2019,

  body: "[[Josef M\xFCller-Brockmann|Brockmann]]? Then it <em>is </em> [[Akzidenz
    Grotesk]].\r\nPossibly a pre-digital version. Take into account that this family
    used to be quite patchworky, and still \u2013 even after GGL\u2019s recut(s) and
    digitization \u2013 is far from being as systematical as Univers etc.\r\n\r\nFrom
    the Wiki:\r\n<cite>The original series remained quite divers, individual weights
    showing not much resemblance but in name. [\u2026] That only changed when they
    cut Series 57, and then Series 58, named for the years of release. These had some
    sizes (but not all) recut under the direction of [[G\xFCnter Gerhard Lange]],
    who was their (freelance) artistic director at the time.</cite>"
