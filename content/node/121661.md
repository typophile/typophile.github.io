  find any free font that I was satisfied with.\r\n\r\nIt's inspired by Handbook,
  DIN and the like. \r\n\r\nThe letters all have same the width as I need that for
  the interface I'm creating:) \r\n\r\nWill probably open source it when done.\r\n\r\nHoping
  to hear your feedback so I can improve it.\r\n\r\nI've created the thinnest, regular
  and black from scratch - the rest are just interpolated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minfontdemo_5415.png]"

  body: "I think it\u2019s looking good for the purpose. A couple of annotations:\r\n-
    Even if it\u2019s a geometric design, I think you should address the top-heaviness
    of the |8|, since you already made other optical adjustments like overshot.\r\n-
    Personally I find the heaviest weight a bit jarring in the open glyphs.\r\n- Not
    a fan of the bump in |6| and |9| either, where the stem joins the loop."

    body: "@riccard0\r\n\r\nthx for the feedback!\r\n\r\nTop-heaviness. I'll will
      try to correct it but still have the geometric feeling\r\nJarring. Jep, wasn't
      happy with the heaviest weights either - also something I'll try to fix.\r\nBump.
      Not sure what you are referring to?\r\n"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tal_4680.png]\r\n\r\nThe stiff bend isn't
    actually any stiffer than the rest of the circle but I've tried to remove it +
    fix the top heaviness + close 2+3+5 a bit more. \r\n\r\nAlso fixed the 7 being
    too thin, and made the top on 1 a bit longer.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your
    suggestions - feel the looks has improved but always room for more :)"

  body: Better overall. Perhaps the top inner cusp of the bottom counter of |5| could
    be moved a bit to the left.
