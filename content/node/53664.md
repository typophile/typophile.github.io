body: "i LoVe tHis CoVer!\r\n\r\nSince our assignment was to find a book cover that
  was interesting and had a strong composition using both text and imagery, I chose
  Ian Fleming's cover to one of his James Bond series books, Casino Royale.  Not only
  is the image of the woman striking, but the text is laid out to fit the form of
  her body.  It is often difficult to layer text on an image, since many people get
  distracted and the text goes unnoticed.  This cover, however, is a fantastic example
  of text done well over an image.  The font has a sophisticated feel but at the same
  time looks as if it could've been drawn by hand.  Even the colors echo the nature
  of the book, purple is a good choice, giving the cover a mysterious eye-catching
  look to it.  This allows for the text to appear to be flowing across the woman's
  body.  The text in the lower right-hand corner stamps the James Bond book series
  with a classic font that gives credit to Penguin Publishing.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/casino-royale-penguin-book-cover-1_3465.jpg]"
