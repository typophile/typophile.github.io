  body: andrij, as with all your work, i think this is great! the letters are indeed
    very lively. i think we'd need to see more text set to see if the latin portion
    really holds together. it looks a bit gappy in places, but it's hard to tell what's
    causing this without more to look at.

  body: i guess this font probably just needs some kerning (which i'm guessing is
    currently missing). the "it" combination was the only real troublesome gap i noticed
    in your set text. "ij" was also a problem in your initial image as were "uv".
    it seems like the serifs/strokes or whatever they are are a bit too large in places,
    but that is part of what gives this such great character. maybe the design needs
    to be regularized a bit to reduce this problem? contextual alternates might be
    another way to solve some of these spacing issues. or again, maybe it's just kerning...

  body: "This is a great design that just seems to smile up at you! Where characters
    in Agara really fit together well it looks great; t followed by h, i followed
    by n.\r\n\r\nHere are my nitpicks:\r\n\r\nThere's a big gap showing up between
    l followed by a or d, and the space after the apostrophe is pretty distracting,
    especially with the spacing before the apostrophe being to tight. It seems like
    theres a much bigger gap following h and n than there is following m, it might
    just be an optical trick.\r\n\r\nI'm also not to hot on that z dipping under the
    baseline. It's a pretty letter, but I could see a lot of designers redrawing it
    just ao that it doesn't stand out. I wouldn't get rid of it, but it would probably
    be a good idea to have an alternate that fits better with everything else."
