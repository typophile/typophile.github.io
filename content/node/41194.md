  a few months, but I was just wondering if I could get some advice.\r\n\r\nI've been
  working at a non-denominational Christian church in Mesa, AZ for a couple years,
  and I'm employed as the graphic designer. But anyways, here is two logos to show
  you the original, and now the updated one I made recently."

  body: "The new one is easier on the eyes for sure. \r\n\r\nBut I am curious about
    the design sensibility. What does it mean? What should a potential member take
    from the choice of font and the way it's presented? \r\n\r\nThe letters seems
    spaced a bit close to me. If the sign is huge that's one thing. But on a T-shirt
    or smaller I might loosen up the kerning a bit."

  body: I'm not sure the dotted line adds anything to the design, or relates to any
    other part. I'm also not a big fan of the "Web 2.0" gradient on the type, but
    maybe this is "Church 2.0?" :)

    it was running over the edges of the\r\n\"O\" which made it more dynamic than
    having\r\nit in the circle.\r\n\r\nit seems the man/woman tries to jump out\r\nand
    bangs his/her head on the circle...\r\n\r\nalso the doted line doesn't do it for
    me, \r\nit seems it has been placed without a reason...\r\n\r\njust my two cents/rappen\r\n\r\nbut
    i think you did a good job regarding the\r\nreadability!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks so much for the input!\r\n\r\nI see the most questions are regarding
    Helvetica...\r\n\r\nWell, if you guys have seen a typical church logo, it always
    seems to have crosses, rivers, mountains, etc., along with fancy serif'd fonts
    and such.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue for me was common stereotypes associated with
    'church.' I don't believe that crosses, rivers, mountains and all fit any demographic
    at all anymore. And although real church's don't necessarily target any specific
    demographic, the identity should be simple and neutral.\r\n\r\nThe reason I used
    Helvetica as just an initial idea was because of it's legibility from distances.
    It is more fuller in my opinion, and is easier to read if it was to be on a sign.
    As opposed to the first logo I've shown that is News Gothic Standard.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    about the design itself, the original logo before I made the 'old' one was just
    the character logo that had 'Spring of Life' adjacent to it in a horrible font
    called 'Rage Italic' I've never been a fan of open logos (logos that have no distinct
    shape) and 'he' the logo just kinda was standing alone.\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks
    again for the advice! I'll see what else I can do with it!\r\n\r\nTy"

  body: "For me Helvetica reads as \"middle of the road\" and Consumer oriented. The
    dots are weird to see in a church logo too - but they are doing a job - separating
    elements so I can't ding them except maybe to question the tone they set which
    is a bit techy maybe. I think you might want to look at other Sans faces as well.
    What about something with a hint of humanism about it? Maybe something like this?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=fonts_in_use&findme=auto\r\n\r\n(depending
    on intent of course)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which; I would encourage you not merely
    to break with the previous graphic language ( saying what you are not ) but to
    describe as fully as you can how the new graphics should read ( saying what you
    are ). \r\n\r\nI will be interested to see how you proceed."

  body: I think the wordspacing for the name is too loose and the tag line is much
    too close to the name. A general rule of thumb I follow (or start from) is my
    line spacing for two lines such as yours (should I need to do this sort of thing)
    should be no less than the word (or letter) spacing of the main type (logo).

  body: "The letters lif are too tight next to that e. It looks like they have formed
    a clique and are leaving poor e out. But this isn't important.\r\n\r\nTo me what
    is important is that even though it is getting better ( it is) I really think
    it won't become really good until you can describe what you are after and why.
    Only then can your choices be deliberate. \r\n\r\nYou can always make something
    that comes close to being a good design by following typographic \"rules\" or
    by emulating other designs you like but you can't get past a 50% or 60% success
    without serious consideration of the context. Until that happens the design isn't
    grounded in it's purpose. And it will niggle you like a loose tooth or badly fitting
    clothing because it won't be quite right.\r\n\r\nI don't mean to brow beat you
    here. I hope it doesn't feel that way. Quite the opposite. I hope this helps reduce
    frustration while you are designing.\r\n"

  body: "frode - Yeah, I'm not the original designer of the logo, I'm just trying
    to develop it.\r\n\r\nEben - No, not at all, you're helping me out a lot. This
    is the first opportunity I've had to been in community with other designers/typographers,
    and everyone is making really valid suggestions and critiques.\r\n\r\nNow about
    the logo... To be honest, I don't know what I'm after. Since I'm NOT the original
    designer of the identity (the jumping man), and the fact that I will never be
    allowed to design a new one, I'm pretty much stuck with a graphic that I don't
    know what to do anything with. Unfortunately, when the original designer thought
    of 'Spring of Life' he/she thought of a image of an abstract humanoid slipping
    on an oil slick, lol. So like I said, since the logo has been established going
    on 10 years... I'm at a lost.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I haven't even been authorized to
    try and develop a new identity using the old graphic, I was just trying to make
    it more appealing in a design perspective.\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: 'Thanks for framing the situation. I understand what you are facing better
    now. I would suggest that as much as you might be able to do by skirting the issue
    you might request that the church sanction what you are doing in a broader way.
    Then they could partner with you to develop a clear idea of the message that a
    new logo/identity might allow. Maybe this is just me but designing around the
    edges guerilla style and without any involvement or conceptual "buy-in" has always
    been a recipe for headaches for me. It just never felt worthwhile or satisfying.
    Maybe you can handle it better than me. :-) Cheers! '

  body: "1 - I definitely think you're moving in a better direction, but why Century
    Gothic? Do you happen to have Avenir on your system, Century Gothic is a pale
    derivative of Frutiger's genius face.\r\n\r\n2 - Have you thought about just ditching
    the circle around the jumping figure? Or creating a transparent gradient so that
    it is jumping \"out\" of something, but jumps into the more \"ethereal\". The
    only problem with that approach is you have to keep the logo in Illustrator format,
    not generic EPS, however, you can retain spot colors doing a gradient like that
    in Illy. It could be worth looking into.\r\n\r\n3 - I agree with one of the earlier
    comments who said the bottom eyebrow \"Christian Church\" is probably a little
    too close, vertically, to the name. I assume this will have to go on a website
    and other placements where the render size could be as small as 100 px vertical,
    so that's going to shrink down really fast. Maybe do two logos? One for print
    over a certain size and one for small print/web sizing? \r\n\r\n\r\nI do like
    the evolution, no pun intended =)"
