body: In the late 1970's my wife and I and two small children lived in a crowded Tokyo
  apartment. We needed an extra clothes cabinet so we bought the first one we found.
  It consisted of a metal frame covered with nylon on which was printed a garish pattern
  of coffee beans and garbled Italian and English text.  Over the years the design
  became a family joke and we remember that item fondly long after the original has
  gone. Here is a recreation of the pattern- the original typography was much better
  but this gives the general effect. The Italian is either misremembered or was supposed
  to have been Pranzo In Cucina - lunch in the Kitchen. Hence the kitch designation.
  Anybody seen such a design anywhere? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/pranzoincucci_6242.jpg]

    for ME to say much about this, since it's not the real mccoy, and there are too
    many variables to know what the piece actually looked like.\r\n\r\nbut you should
    keep fond memories of your time in tokyo and the goofy cabinet you had while there."

    the original. But at this distance in time I have a feeling there was a standard
    '70's design look - epitomised by Saul Bass's movie title style. I'm still in
    Tokyo - now for graphic goofiness one goes to www.engrish.com "

  body: I have some ideas but its too hard to say since this isn't real. I know you
    are trying to recreate the 'effect' but like someone else said, there are too
    many variables.
