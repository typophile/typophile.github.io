  <BR> <BR>I loved what he did so I decided to jump on and try my hand at a bitmap
  version of Trajan. Well, here it is. What do you think? I have tried not to &#34;borrow&#34;
  any letterforms, but it may very well be that I arrived at similar conclusions &#40;I
  went through a terrible time just before graduating where someone had used a typeface
  that looked almost exactly like a creation of my own. I thought they had stolen
  it! argh!&#41;. Either way, it&#39;s just for fun. <BR> <BR>Also, could anyone point
  me some information on the creation of bitmap fonts? I am thinking of developing
  my own composition software in Macomedia Director. <BR> <BR>- Chris'

    <BR> <BR>Have you tried giving this stroke contrast? That&#39;s a hallmark of
    the Roman inscriptions after all. <BR> <BR>For the &#34;X&#34;, one way to unravel
    it might be to make it non-laterally-symmetrical - offset the top-right and bottom-left
    arms from the &#34;main&#34; stroke. <BR> <BR>As for actually delivering bitmap
    fonts, the only really robust way is outline pixelfonts. <BR> <BR>Lastly, if you
    make an editor, Flash would actually be better &#40;even though I&#39;m a Director
    guy myself&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'christopher, <BR> <BR>you are not alone in your admiration for miguel&#39;s
    work. i should think it a complement that others are so inspired by his fonts,
    that they should pick up the discipline of pixel-fonting at all. <BR> <BR>these
    larger 1 pixel stemmed fonts are perhaps the most elegant of pixel fonts overall--so
    long as the letter forms are perfect. if they are flawed or inconsistent across
    the set, then to me, they show their weaknesses more glaringly than their thicker
    or smaller relatives. <BR> <BR>my suggestion is to abandon your initial conception
    of your project. it has its own momentum now, and since miguel has nailed his
    roman/trajan so well, you really don&#39;t stand to gain much unless you can improve
    upon his set. this, as many will point out, would be extremely hard to do. <BR>
    <BR>so, play around with the aspecct ratios of the letters, and especially the
    serifs--to me, they interrupt the grace of your otherwise elegant character lines.
    the UC N is a good example there. <BR> <BR>there is also an optical problem with
    your uc O &amp; Q when seen next to the other upright characters. i think the
    serifs aggrivate the illusion, making the circular characters look one pixel too
    short. <BR> <BR>just to clarify myself, i do not mean that by abandoning your
    original vision of this font there is any implication of failure. i simply mean
    that allowing yourself the flexibility to follow the letter forms that inspire
    you is the first step to creating new and exciting character sets as a whole.
    <BR> <BR>as it stands, the unbalanced serifs, slightly shifting baseline, and
    wide degree of character widths create many directions for experimentation, and
    therefore many combinations of those experiments. <BR> <BR>as an example: uc AY
    in &#34;fridays&#34;. the A really looks like a semiserif. the y looks like a
    formal serif. what would happen if you tried to give the entire font a more gentle,
    subtle semiserif look as you did with the A? <BR> <BR>anyhow, i like this font
    a lot, and look forward to seeing how you finish it up.'

  body: Hah! I&#39;ve seen that before, Hrant, very interesting work! With the &#34;trajic&#34;
    thing I was not so much naming it as I was worrying about killing it; more of
    a thread title. But then to others i am, and that is what I really had to consider.
    ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Bugger, i didn&#39;t spot the &#39;shifting baseline&#39;. That
    was an accident. <BR> <BR>Perhaps I should have spent a little more time developing
    this before posting. My flatmate just got an iMac G5 &#40;beautiful!&#41; and
    i&#39;ve been designing pixel fonts on it over the last week constantly. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m quite eager to pursue the pixel font thing as I think it really has
    value. Hinting seems to be what will really make the difference in the long run,
    however. I was inspired to make some pixel fonts when looking at the horrible
    pixel fonts used in video games. <BR> <BR>Well, I&#39;ve got a varied stroke weight
    version that needs some work. I&#39;ll have a fiddle. I&#39;ll be posting a few
    other things I&#39;ve been working on, perhaps, as well. <BR> <BR>I agree with
    your idea of abandoning the initial concept, though for me as an amateur I&#39;m
    sort of &#34;finding&#34; my feet. Exploring and what-not. I&#39;m quite in to
    the roman proportions and produced a sans serif based on them for a university
    project a short time ago. <BR> <BR>Outlines for pixel fonts? Hmm. I have access
    to fontlab, so I&#39;ll try maybe turning emigre&#39;s Lorez into my own design.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback, people! Its always a great way to learn. <BR>

  body: yes, the new bitfonter is a good tool to use for pixel fonts, but i think
    that fontlab, with its more robust exporting/metatag options is the platform to
    choose if you can afford it. <BR> <BR>truthfully, the price difference between
    fl and bf is disproportionate to the broader power and functionality of fl. <BR>
    <BR>however, i do use both, in addition to the other usual graphics programs,
    in my workflow.

  body: I meant using Lorez as a template; there may be some special size and spacing
    issues I&#39;m not aware of. That way I can use the spacing that Lorez uses. Hmm.
    Is that Illegal?

    you out a simple credit somewhere would be good. <BR> <BR>hhp
