body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nCan you please recommend any type specimen books (excluding the
  Rookledge book) that arrange the type faces that most closely look the same in design
  and are arranged that way.\r\nI am an art director/designer and when choosing a
  typeface I would like to examine the minute design details of similiarly designed
  typefaces so I can pick the best face for legibility, tone, and appropriateness.\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSal Randazzo\r\n\r\n"
