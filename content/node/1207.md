    Also, I think this whole UPS logo discussion  <BR>is incredibly blown out of proportions.

  body: Yves - Hrant&#39;s argument <i>does</i> make sense. Wearing this <BR>shirt
    wouldn&#39;t be advertising the company but drawing <BR>attention to the <i>old</i>
    logo, which in turn draws attention <BR>to graphic design. So if you have a problem
    with the <BR>Typophile shirt focusing on graphic design - so be it. But <BR>this
    shirt is not promoting UPS. <BR> <BR>...I think your bad day is getting the better
    of your usual <BR>good judgment. I hope tomorrow is better, pal. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: the UPS logotype was Rand&#39;s custom design...so it could have to do typography
    - at least moreso then the pick-a-font, any font -FF Dax decision. Still though,
    that comment, Hrant! If logotype isin&#39;t in the &#34;typography&#34; realm
    what is? Would you save all the perfect kerning, genius font choices, and intuitive
    applications for your newspaper headlines instead? <BR> <BR>won&#39;t most of
    the t-shirts have to do with making a nice looking &#34;logotype&#34; stylin&#39;
    for typophile in any case? <BR> <BR>no stems on Rands upright u..still the r maybe
    off. <BR>

    it has some letters in it, that shirt is <i>about</i> a logo, and a logo is graphic
    design, not typography. <BR>The two have overlap, but they&#39;re not the same

  body: yes, graphic design can happen without type - but logo&#40;types&#41; can
    hardly happen without type. last time I checked TDC annnuals, included many, many
    logos for awards and review...in the typographical vein.  <BR> <BR>If a logo is
    pure graphic design, and typography is an element or tool for graphic design you
    still can

  body: Start thinking outside the bouma. <BR> <BR>I think the UPS/RIP one is hilarious,
    despite the chopped u  <BR>awkwardness. The bow plus the word &#34;remember&#34;
    is great  <BR>&#40;i.e. tying a string on your finger to remember&#41;. <BR> <BR>Just
    don&#39;t get offended when graphic designers use type to  <BR>tell a story /
    create a mark / make someone pause or  <BR>consider something other than glyphs
    and word-shapes.  <BR>It&#39;s what graphic designers do. In fact, we deliberately  <BR>invited
    two graphic designers to sit on the judges panel for  <BR>that very reason.

  body: It&#39;s all well and good for us to sit around and trash the UPS logo, and
    I agree, as a designer I lament the decision to &#34;update&#34; it in the manner
    they did. That said, none of us were privy to the dicussions, strategy, planning,
    research, etc. that supported the identity change. It was a process to be sure,
    and one which I am very sure everyone involved took very, very seriously.  <BR>
    <BR>Is it good design? My gut response is no. But let&#39;s take a minute to ask
    ourselves what really makes design good. Is it being pretty? Stylish? Well crafted?
    Relevant? Effective? Clear? Maybe, just maybe, UPS&#39;s primary audience is not
    graphic designers, design historians, and so-called typophiles. Maybe this new
    logo WORKS for them.  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s it. Just a little injection of perspective.
    Personally I use FedEx.

  body: '&#39;rip&#39; is humorously incorrect. <BR>  <BR>Hrant: so typography is
    only a part of logo design if you draw the type yourself? Some designers tweak
    every letter in a logo, even if they started with a font.  Maybe derivative, but
    I think it&#39;s typography &#40;lowercase t&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The fonts I use are
    derivative of Roman letters ... they got &#39;em from the Greeks, before was the

    <BR> <BR>Typography is part of the logo design if there&#39;s something in it
