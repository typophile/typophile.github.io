  body: "Cheers guys. This font is plenty heap 'o fun. It's a Roman inscriptional
    kind of thing, but not inscribed as such. A synthetic technical pen tool is the
    basis for the stroke design and finish.\r\n\r\nIt has Ar'deco-influenced Trajanesque
    capitals with several twists, quite a few phantom letters, a wacky lower case,
    and a contextual alternates feature that swaps in a more text-friendly (read:
    more readable) character set.\r\n\r\nWhat else? Oh, a proper Lining Numbers feature:
    turn on the lining numeral set and all the math and currency symbols are positioned
    to suit. Luxury! What else? A supporting cast of 590 extras---stacks of stylistic
    alternates and a staggering array of ligatures. Some of the ligature pairs are
    fitted like the THE word lig.\r\n\r\nI've completed testing all the OT features,
    and now I'm finishing kerning. \r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    which well-known mountain in the Colorado Rockies?\r\n\r\n2) Pyke's Peak sports
    a bristling array of glyph types & letter structures. Forms include phantoms,
    dot phantoms, mirror glyphs, fitted pairs and superposed ligatures (ligs formed
    by letters eating into & growing out of each other.) The question is, w h y ?\r\na)
    To keep designers off the streets\r\nb) To create an enigmatic type effect reminiscent
    of hand-lettering\r\nc) To give credence to the word \"Arboghastian\"\r\nd) To
    create a big scary opentype monster\r\n\r\n3) Looking at these Pykie type samples
    makes you feel---\r\na) Excited\r\nb) Strange\r\nc) Sharp & furry\r\nc) By degrees
    terrified\r\n\r\n4) There is an annual race up Pike's Peak mountain in a special
    breed of supercharged cars known as Pike's Peak racers. What's the all-time record
    for getting to the top?\r\n\r\n5) James Pike was the Episcopal bishop of which
    Diocese?\r\n\r\n6) Bishop James Pike officiated at the wedding of Nancy Hackett
    to which highly-regarded American science fiction writer? Clue---he lived in Oakland,
    California. No really.\r\n\r\n7) Backwards-facing capital letters are---\r\na)
    Capitals that fell into a time mirror in ancient Roma and came out on our side
    reversed\r\nb) A neat-if-vexing method of solving certain kinds of ligatures,
    eg: Em, EE, ER, RB etc.\r\nc) Fascinating but I'm glad I'm not having lunch with
    them\r\nd) Too disturbing even for pretend consideration\r\n\r\n8) Which one-liner
    best describes Pyke's Peak?\r\na) Cryptomagmous barking-mad bannana fritters\r\nb)
    The work of several seditious scribes from Ceaserea\r\nc) Trippy rub-down Arcadian
    magic\r\nd) The System of Professor Tar & Doctor Feather\r\n\r\n9) Name three
    kinds of material you would use Pyke's Peak on.\r\n\r\n10) True of false? A copy

    times reading the lowercase w (and slightly also the uppercase version) because
    of its disjoint left stroke; similar to the EE ligature, if the left side had
    just a dot instead of the stroke, like all other mirrored E's I've seen, it might
    be easier. But you have finished your glyphs and are only working on kerning,
    so I'll shut up.))\r\n\r\n"

    w-W are a legiblity challenge but users can replace all instances of w, e and
    g with non-gapped alternates all at once by turning on the CALT feature. The CALT
    character set includes a normal <strong>s</strong> too.\r\n\r\nThat dot phantom
    EM lig is a second variety. Default E, including all ligs and mirror ligs, has
    the stroke. And for people who are getting really bored there's the cursive E,
    which I made out of the B. I tried to think of everything.\r\n\r\nKeep coming
    with the feedback. The glyphs are finalized but it's still good to get opinions.\r\n\r\nj

    these Pykie type samples makes you feel Sharp & Furry is the answer I was hoping
    for.\r\n\r\n4) \"Without Googling: 12 minutes, 21 seconds.\" is a good guess and
    close to the 'correct' answer. According to Wikipedia the all-time record is 10:01.408,
    set by Nobuhiro Tajima \"in a Suzuki XL7 Hill Climb Special while racing the Unlimited
    category. He beat the previous record set by Rod Millen set 13 years before in
    1994 of 10:04.06. \"\r\n\r\n5) James Pike was the Episcopal bishop of California.\r\n\r\n6)
    Bishop James Pike officiated at the wedding of Nancy Hackett to Philip K. Dick.
    But the image of L. Ron Hubbard as a highly-respected sci-fi writer is suitably
    comical.\r\n\r\n7) Backwards-facing capital letters are \"Fascinating but I\u2019m
    glad I\u2019m not having lunch with them\" is a good answer. I was plumping for
    the time scoop theory.\r\n\r\n8) The System of Professor Tar & Doctor Feather
