  body: I use Google Analytics for our website where I work, and I have no complaints.
    It gives you a ton of data, and you can also create customized reports (like finding
    the number of hits to a web page from a specific domain). The custom reports can
    be a little confusing to set up, though. For free, though, it's hard to beat.

    that caused it to slow sites down. I use it in combination with a Wordpress plugin
    called \u201CWassup\u201D so that I have two ways to analyzing traffic."
