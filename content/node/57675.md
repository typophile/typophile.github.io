    that might be close -- [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/peignot/|Peignot Light]].
    Without a larger image to see some detail, this will be hard to ID with any certainty.\r\n\r\n(If
    you have a series of 'Wine Labels' for ID, please use the name of the wine so
    that we know we haven't already answered your question? I almost didn't open this
    thread because I thought it was a duplicate.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    E arms and J tail lengths don't look quite right."

  body: thank you very much guys. unfortunately that is the only image i can get (it
    was cropped from a screenshot). the wine label belongs to [[http://www.jmf.pt
    | jose maria de fonseca]] and it's called "jose de sousa". thanks once again for
    you efforts and i appologize for the previous wrong post.

    better shot of a different label]] look like Trajan.

    in purple outline on top. I think the S has the wrong inflection but it's close.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/josedesousa_6262.gif]

  body: "I tend to agree with Florian about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/castle-lt/light/|Castle
    Light]] being very close, but this JDS font has a more open G (presuming the same
    font is used for the small lettering), and a somewhat different J. It's also a
    bit more tapered, or contrast-y (not sure how to describe the swelling thicknesses,
    especially in the curves of the S, O and D). \r\n\r\nIt's almost like a 'display'
    version of Castle.\r\n\r\nVery elegant, I agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
