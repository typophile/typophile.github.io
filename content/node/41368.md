body: "for a while now (2 years) my indesign has been experiencing lapses in memory
  when it comes to recognising certain typefaces. so far, it's only been parts of
  font sets or large chunks of sets (e.g., one day all of Malm\xF6 Sans works, but
  the next finds the alternative ligatures, \"LigAlt\", missing). what's interesting
  is that the font isn't actually missing, but is being listed under another name
  (e.g., what was once \"LigAlt\" becomes listed as \"LigaturesAlt\" or \"Ligatures
  Alt\" or \"Lig Alt\" causing indesign to believe it is missing). \r\n\r\nreinstall
  the font, right? already tried. it does the same thing; doesn't recognise the original
  naming. the fonts are central, so nothing is coming through a server. it's the same
  font, no copy of it exists in multiple places. i've also tried completely removing
  the \"trouble\" fonts and reinstalling them with the fresh, originally purchased
  files, only to see it happen again. i've also tried different methods of importing
  them into font programs (adding and copying, strictly adding not copying, and moving).\r\n\r\ni
  started noticing the problem with h&fj's gotham when a file, that was being shared
  by the art director and i (being copied from a server and worked on centrally),
  refused to recognise the bold set by the name the art director's computer was using.
  i figured the problem was in two computers, two different os versions, two different
  font programs, or two different versions of indesign. not the case, our platforms
  are identical except that one is a macbook pro and the other a g5 tower. (note:
  it is not, however, specific to the use of files between two people/computers. it
  happens with files originating and staying on my computer, as well.)\r\n\r\nthe
  problem doesn't seem so much a \"problem\" when a simple selection of the content
  and change of font name is the solution, but i'm sure you'll understand that when
  the problem occurs with manual ligature alternatives (and the nomenclature changing
  back and forth, back and forth) pages start looking like they're ridden with chicken
  pox.\r\n\r\nthe simplest solution i've come to is restarting my computer, which
  isn't much of a solution, being that a couple more times of opening/closing the
  file finds the problem occurring again. it \"seems\" completely erratic, and i'm
  tempted to assume that my indesign has an emotional quarrel with me for critiquing
  its limited pathfinder options.\r\n\r\nany ideas will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n-

    be a corrupted. Have you tried saving as INX and opening it back again?\r\nAre
    the fonts Type1 or OpenType?"

    to a cs2 as a result of downgrading. mind, this isn't just a problem with one
    file, though, but several; and not just one font, but several.\r\n\r\nthe fonts
    are T1's, miguel.\r\n\r\ntried font finagler, miss tiff, we'll see if it works.\r\n\r\nthanks,
