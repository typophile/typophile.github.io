  that inspire you to greatness?\r\n\r\nFrom [[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Russian_proverbs|Wikiquote.org]]:\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>\u0411\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043D\u043E\u0439
  \u0441\u043E\u0431\u0430\u043A\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u043C\u044C \u0432\u0451\u0440\u0441\u0442
  \u043D\u0435 \u043A\u0440\u044E\u043A.</strong>\r\nTransliteration: Beshenoy sobake
  sem' vyorst ne kryuk.\r\nTranslation: For a mad dog, seven versts (Russian mile)
  is not a long detour.\r\nMoral: If you are passionate (or unreasonably driven) about
  something you will do all the extra work without noticing it.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n"
