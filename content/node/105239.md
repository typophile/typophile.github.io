  Black but I have no idea what the other font is. I've asked for a better copy of
  their logo but they keep sending me tiny, useless images (not vectors).\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated, thanks."

  body: "Thank you SO much!\r\n\r\nThe Energizer is definitely some form of Helvetica.
    I was able to use LT Condensed Black Oblique with just a little tracking and kerning
    the sides of the \"i.\" It matches almost perfectly. (Blue is my version over
    the black original).\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FoundFont_3559.jpg]"
