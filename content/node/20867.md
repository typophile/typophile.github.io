  body: Goran, I was the one who removed the link. While it is good to get this information,
    it isn't good to post it publicly. While there are those of us who wouldn't download
    such files, there are those who dig through the web looking for downloads. The
    best thing you can do is give the link to someone who will see that it gets to
    the right people who can take care of it. For instance, I am one such person who
    is in contact with many foundries.

    all thieves are also lazy. \r\nGood thing this site removes profanity or I would
    be tempted to say some unkind words about people who steal other's work :-(\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS:
    Please assume there is a long string of very bad words following in the language
    of your choice..."

    dafont keeps it pretty clean. Do you know of anything in particular that is questionable?
    My guess is they would remove it if so."

  body: According to a source that I trust DaFont has been very good about removing
    anything which isn't kosher. If you know of others that really should be removed
    send me a note.
