  body: It's hard to tell the weights, etc. when the type is distroted by the folds
    of the clothing. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sideshow/coffee-service/|Coffee
    Service]] may be a suitable match for "The" and [[http://www.linotype.com/187496/sackersgothicheavy-font.html|Sackers
    Gothic Heavy]] may be a good match for "CITY". At first I thought I could see
    Copperplate Gothic serifs on the C, but now I'm not so sure.
