  \ \r\nwondering if someone can report any similar problems - or even  \r\nsolutions:\r\nA
  customer uses one of our fonts (OpenType CFF) with QuarkXPress  \r\n7.3.1 on Mac
  OS 10.4.6. If the \"standard ligature\" feature is turned  \r\non, sometimes (not
  always) any further editing of the text (like  \r\nmanual Kerning, Spacing, horizontal
  scaling etc.) will result in a  \r\ncrash of Quark (not the OS). If the ligatures
  are off everything  \r\nworks fine.\r\n\r\nIs there a known problem of Quark with
  OT-features?\r\nThanks for any ideas!\r\nOliver\r\n"
