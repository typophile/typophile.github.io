body: Designed for use as button text on web sites, Benson Caps is my statement to
  the bitmap-caps conversation. Benson Caps seeks uniqueness by including a &#34;Button&#34;
  face, including various ornaments, connectors, and endpieces. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also
  intrigued by constructing the letters based on some of the historical texts I&#39;ve
  read; traditional &#40;triangular&#41; A, two-story lowercase G, contrast the bowls
  of the P and R, the J descends, etc.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/229.gif"

  body: ' Jared, <BR>Superb stuff! <BR>You&#39;re designing for the medium, and there&#39;s
    nothing better. The button/border idea is &#42;right on&#42;, and I think you
    should definitely take it even further: beveled ones, multiple-outline ones, etc.
    <BR> <BR>As for the letters themselves, the regular caps are well made, but I
    have a problem with some of the alternates: I&#39;ve never liked so-called &#34;unicase&#34;
    fonts - I don&#39;t think they&#39;re worthwhile; I think it would be much better
    to provide true alternative cap designs. Small bitmap fonts really benefit from
    usable alternates. <BR> <BR>Allow me to make these suggestions for the alternates:
    <BR>A: Make a round-top one. <BR>E: Make one with rounded corners. <BR>G: It&#39;s
    too tall. The only bicameral &#34;g&#34; that <BR>   works at 6 pixels high is
    the Koch form. <BR>L: Give it a longer base - it could be useful at the <BR>end
    of a word. &#40;Set the right sidebearing flush.&#41; <BR>M: Make a round-top
    one, with a hanging middle stem. <BR>Q: Don&#39;t change a thing! <BR>S: Make
    a wider one? <BR>T: Like the &#34;L&#34;, make a version that spans wider. <BR>U:
    Super! <BR>W: Make one with the middle going full-height? <BR>Y: This form is
    a favorite of mine. <BR> <BR>BTW, the descending &#34;J&#34; is brilliant. You
    might consider doing that with the &#34;G&#34; as well, probably as an alternate.
    And the &#34;P&#34;-&#34;R&#34; distinction is great. For the numeral &#34;3&#34;
    I&#39;d pull in the middle bar. <BR> <BR>All in all, you have a winner. <BR>Go
    all the way with it. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Kudos, Jared on retaining some really fine nuances that are strikingly absent
    in most screen fonts. &#40;Like you mentioned, the triangular A, the stacked a
    and g, the descending J. Further, typical fonts in this genre totally avoid the
    lower case. <BR> <BR>The ornaments are just icing on the cake and take the thing
    to the next level. <BR> <BR>&#40;Stephen, I&#39;ve been thinking the same thing.&#41;
