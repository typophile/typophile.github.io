    shown as Diana in the Solotype Catalog, and sold as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/ef-bold/testdrive.html?s=Thompsons&p=48\"
    target=\"new\">Ballantines Script </a>might be a fairly close substitute. \r\n\r\nAt
    least it would be a place to start, and with a few modifications, you could come
    fairly close.\r\n\r\nYou could also browse the Casual Flowing Script samples in
    <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html\" target=\"new\">Part 7
    of the Script Font ID Guide</a> for similar styles.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "After much hunting and realizing that this was probably done on some type
    of vinyl cutting machine (like Gerber) I tracked down this font where most all
    of the letters are the same - it looks like the lower case o was modified and
    some new \"connections\" were created between letters.\r\n\r\nThe font appears
    to be called Jancyzk Jubilee\r\nhttp://lendaproducts.com/graphics/letstyle/page201.htm\r\n\r\nCuriously,
    any idea of it's origins?"

  body: "I'd like to know how you found that! Maybe you should be on this panel, if
    you can pull that one out of a hat like that. Looks like some of their typefaces
    are using the 'real' names, and some are renamed, so Jancyzk Jubilee might be
    anything.\r\n\r\nThe style resembles Brody, but I can't find anything else very
    close. It looks like the 30's era styles that Nick Curtis and Harold Lohner have
    mined so well from old lettering books. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: "Mike, well if you consider checking in every hour or so to help ID fonts,
      I am on this panel - I set up an account a few months ago and try to help.\r\n\r\nBut,
      it's like the game show Jeopardy. Too many people \"buzz in\" before me and
      ID the font before I can.\r\n\r\nThere are some amazing people here that can
      recognize obscure fonts from independent foundries. My problem is that I know
      I've seen the fonts before, but cannot remember the name or where to find it."

    Walcott's <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg9.html\" target=\"new\">'Hucklebuck'
    </a>is a very similar style. If he tells where he found that one I think you'd
    be close to your source. (The font is sold by Veer in the Jukebox collection).\r\n\r\n-

    I'm guessing a lot of folks had access to the same sample books maybe?\r\n\r\n-

    object is to find a match to the sample GIF, I would say that <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/monotype-script/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Monotype Script</a> is a lot closer than any of the other options
    offered so far.\r\n\r\nOr, you might consider a couple of my humble offerings:
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/moonshine-script-nf/\" target=\"_blank\">Moonshine
    Script</a> or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/pismo-clambake-nf/\"

  body: "Monotype script has NO matching letters - it IS Jancyzk Jubilee with some
    minor modifications - specifically the lower case o.\r\n\r\nAs for finding it,
    I remember it from my old days working at a sign shop - I knew that I had seen
    it before and then I had one of those \"ah-hah\" moments that come out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nSome
    people want exact and similar just won't cut it."

    the help of people with a lot of type 'exposure', and your sign shop experience
    should help, but it will be a big handicap if you have trouble remembering the
    names or where you saw them ;).\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for trying. It's less important
    <em>who</em> gets the ID than it is that we <em>do</em> get the ID. \r\n\r\n-
