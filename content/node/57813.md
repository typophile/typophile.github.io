body: "I'm running Fedora Linux 10 with Gnome and Compiz Fusion window manager.  \r\nMy
  monitor is a generic flat panel LCD running at (1440 x 900) at 88 DPI.  My graphics
  card isn't the best, but has 3D acceleration.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is.  I'm looking
  for a semi-unified font for both Browser and Desktop, ideas?  (I'm leaning toward
  a serif since I've been using the default _sans for ages now.)\r\n\r\nWhat are you
  all using (especially Mac users)?  (Screenshots ?) \r\n  \r\n"

  body: It's nothing fancy, but I've been enjoying a switch away from the default
    Vera-based choices to the Droid fonts. A bit more condensed, but very readable,
    and with sans, mono and serif that work well together on-screen at normal text
    sizes.
