  body: "The best way would be to draw it on rough textured paper and scan it. You
    could write out the alphabet and numerals, then chop that up and collage it in
    Photoshop, but if you didn't make alternate versions of characters that will be
    repeated it will probably start looking like something you downloaded free from
    dafonts.\r\n\r\nIf you really must draw like this on-screen, have a look at [[http://www.artrage.com/|Artrage]].
    It's software that emulates drawing and painting pretty convincingly. You can
    set the texture of the surface you work on and how wet or dry brushes, ink, paint
    etc. are. I use it, but as far as I can tell it is only good for making images
    for screen resolution, not for print."

    Artrage could be one of best choices. Thank you.\r\n\r\n"
