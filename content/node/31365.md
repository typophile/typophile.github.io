  where I am redesigning some beer labels for a brewery. I want to modernize their
  labels, and I am in doubt if I should modernize their logo as well. I do not want
  make any major changes to it, but maybe give it a facelift, or a more modern up
  to date look.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for how this could be done,
  or what I should be looking for, what makes the logo look outdated and could be
  changed? Or does the logo look good as it is?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions or thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nCarl
  Herup\r\n"

  body: "Experience is a highly valued trait in beer marketing, and a nostalgic looking
    logo that evokes the deep history of the brewery is highly desirable. Modernism
    for modernism's sake is a bad idea for beer, except in rare cases for absolutely
    new brands and styles. There is, however, plenty of room for improvement in this
    logo here. \r\n\r\nFirst off, it looks like it says \"Restrooms\" at first glance.
    There isn't much you can do about this without convincing the company to change
    the name, but at least it evokes another idea associated with beer. \r\n\r\nThe
    tail of the R seems rather heavy and inelegant, but it should remain in some way
    so as to not disturb the brand too much. Gently curving and tapering the understroke
    might be enough. The rest of the letters might benefit by switching them to a
    more fluidly connected script font, rather than the italic currently in use.\r\n\r\nWhatever
    you wind up doing, the key elements of the brand appear to be the big green R
    and diagonal stripe extending from it. You can probably get away with anything
    else, including reshaping those elements, so long as those things are included."

    would be.  But then again, part of the fun of being a student is that you don't
    have those rules to restrain you (its also part of the challenge).\r\n\r\nOne
    option might be to use the current logo, but in a new way."

  body: Both R and r are hideous, but at least the big one could work with some heavy
    tweaking. The tail on t needs to go, too-these letters aren't script! Last, ff
    should be a ligature without a slant, and might look better connected to the swash
    below.

  body: 'Both of your revisions are big improvements on the original (my preference
    is for #2, except the curl of the R tail looks better in #1), but what I meant
    to say earlier (I thought I did, in a jumbled up way) is that while a big green
    "R" with a heavy diagonal stripe are identifying features of the brand, it doesn''t
    necessarily have to be the <em>same</em> "R" as what you''re starting with. It
    probably should remain something scripty/swashy, but try other styles to see how
    they work.'
