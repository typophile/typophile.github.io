body: "Hi there -- I am actually interested in identifying both typefaces in this
  image -- which have been manually distorted to appear in perspective (and the main
  part extruded to look three dimensional).\r\nBoth fonts remind me of Emigre -- the
  A in Smash is a bit like Platelet but the overall font is less quirky.\r\nIf anyone
  can identify either the main 3D typeface or the plainer caption text, I would be
  very grateful.\r\nMany thanks"

    Din Text  from Parachute could also work for the other text"

      body: "Actually looking at the smaller font, I don't think it is Champagne and
        Limousines, but it is close. The 3 and the 8 are much less symmetrical top
        to bottom in Champagne and Limousines. Maybe it is PF DIN with the 1 substituted
        for a capital I to achieve the alternate form?\r\nThan you again, I probably
        never would have found Cubano.\r\n"
