The typeface is made up of four geometric thin lines and it looks like it is based around Futura or similar and as far as I can tell ther is only a caps version.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">The only versions I could find were also TTF. I think this font was used as a film typeface. I show a number of old scans as well as some current multi-line fonts in the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html" target="new">Lined Fonts ID Guide</a>. That might help you find an alternative. Sources are listed in the Guide.

Another possbility, which may not work well, is to convert the font from TTF to Type1. I say it may not work well, because the TT outlines may not be good quality, and that would make 'garbage in- garbage out' situation.

Perhaps you could work on <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide05.html" target="_blank">Stack</a> instead? I've never seen a digital version of that. Nah. The fact that Letraset holds the copyright probably rules Stack out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, Once again I am very impressed with the extent of your knowledge about existing digitizations. Do you have a database with all this info? You must spend a lot of time scouring the web's free sites. If Dieter's fonts were shown with samples that didn't require clicking to a new page to see, I am sure I would have found many more useful revivals. As it is, many of my Guide samples have come from his collection.

Thanks for pointing this one out. I'll be sure to add it to that Guide.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Mike. I've got a very marked up Solotype Catalog in which I note every digitization (excluding renamed clones) that I find of a typeface shown in there. I've started, too, to make notations in my Homage To The Alphabet and an old VGC catalog as well for the typefaces in those that don't make an appearance in the Solotype Catalog.

My days of "scouring the web's free sites" – except for a few Asian ones - are well behind me. Pretty much the only freebie revivals I see any more come from those who contribute fonts directly to Cybapee's wonderful TypOasis. Herr Steffmann used to offer his fonts – complete with graphic samples – from his own website, but that got too expensive and Petra stepped in to the rescue (as seems to be in her nature).

I rely on DaFont's New Releases to monitor what's out there freebie-wise and I check TypOasis and MyFonts' What's New pages regularly. On the latter, I love to see new revivals pop up by Dan Solo, Nick Curtis and Canada Type (the latter splendid old scripts, but you probably are well aware of their stuff).</div>

If you are looking for a digital version of Stack: Rafael Dinner digitized it as a shareware font called Reverb. However it has a very limited characterset but if you only need a few letters maybe this one will do for you.

		<div class="commentbody">Sander - Thank you very much for pointing me to that digitization of Stack. It's amazing how many years those fonts have been offered on that web page - which has changed very little in all that time. I'd forgotten about it.

I registered Stiletto Silver from Rafaael Dinner years ago (this being one of two digitizations I'm aware of of Calypso Initials), but somehow never made the connection between his Stack and the one in the Catalog.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Patty, I thought most of us Mac users had our utilities to convert TTF files to Mac format (I use Fontgrapher, but there are cheaper options). For my purposes that has always worked well. 

I think typOasis is geared to <em>most</em> font users, which are PC users (just based on the distribution of computers, with Macs still not much above 10%), whether we like it or not. You'd also have to admit that not all font lovers are professional graphics designers (yet), and even that not all graphics designers use Macs any more.

Mike, I'd love to get my hands on your copy of the Solotype Catalog. I have also got mine full of notes, but I have apparently not been as thorough, or wide-ranging, in my correlations.
