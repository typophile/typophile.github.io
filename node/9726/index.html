  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've taken part in many discussions about the flaws/merits of the various ways of presenting type specimens on the web. But one thing that I've yet to get a handle on is the security aspect (referring to the extraction of fonts by hackers). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bitmaps are of course totally safe (except for bitmap fonts! :-), but they're yucky in so many ways. Even the ones that generate images of user-defined phrases real-time are uninspiring to me. I personally like specimens where you can type &quot;live&quot; (like on <a href="http://www.typography.com/">http://www.typography.com/</a> - although I actually think those horizontal jail bars make things worse overall). So if one wants to use a technology which uses the outline font (in one incarnation or another), like PDF, Flash, etc., what are the relative security merits of each? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is general agreement that PDF is not highly secure, but many large, established font houses use them. There is also general agreement that Flash is highly secure, but I've been shown with 90% credibility that it's not. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So far I've been using Shockwave* (not Flash), but that was a temporary solution - even though it's been two years now&hellip; :-/  So what should I *really* use? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/f_arasan.html">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/f_arasan.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

But for the screen I see a number of problems with PDF: it's not live; it's big/slow/clunky; and it doesn't integrate into a web environment like Flash does. SVG is supposed to fix some/all of those, but it's not being supported (which I don't mind - SVG just doesn't smell right to me, for some reason). Oh, and what about MS's WEFT/EOT and BitStream's TrueDoc stuff? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I should say that I'm actually a lot less concerned with security than I might have sounded. My motivations in this thread are: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. I just like to *know* what's going on. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. I'll be posting samples of a new font in the Typophile Forums, and would like to avoid having old/incomplete versions floating around by the time I release it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I figure if someone has the technological savvy to extract fonts, they could also easily change the embed flag. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nice and pragmatic - my cup of tea! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter, you're right.

		<div class="commentbody">Here's something from the Flash manual: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you use a font installed on your system in a Flash movie, Flash embeds the font information in the Flash SWF file, ensuring that the font displays properly in the Flash Player. Not all fonts displayed in Flash can be exported with a movie. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To verify that a font can be exported, use the View &gt; Antialias Text command to preview the text; jagged type indicates that Flash does not recognize that font's outline and will not export the text.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As an alternative to embedding font information, you can use special fonts in Flash called device fonts. Device fonts are not embedded in the Flash SWF file. Instead, the Flash Player uses whatever font on the local computer most closely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->resembles the device font. Because device font information is not embedded, using device fonts yields a somewhat smaller Flash movie file size. In addition, device fonts can be sharper and more legible than embedded fonts at small type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sizes (below 10 points). However, because device fonts are not embedded, if users do not have a font installed on their system that corresponds to the device font, type may look different than expected on a user's system.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flash includes three device fonts, named _sans (similar to Helvetica or Arial), _serif (similar to Times Roman), and _typewriter (similar to Courier). To specify a font as a device font, you select one of the Flash device fonts in the Character <!-- raw HTML omitted -->panel, or select Use Device Fonts in the Text Options panel. You can specify text set in a device font to be selectable, so that users can copy and paste text that appears in your movie. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can use device fonts for static text (text that you create when authoring a movie and that does not change when the movie is displayed) or dynamic text (text that updates periodically through input from a file server, such as sports <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scores or weather data).</div>

I've always assumed that if anyone were able to extract the vectors, they would have to rebuild the font manually by pasting those vectors back into a tool like Fog. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The precaution? When we build the HTF Testdrivers, we included a limited character set just in case someone, someday, was able to extract them.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Do you mask the specimen or not? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No! I thought about this myself, and here's my [typically pragmatic] conclusion: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You have to draw an -admittedly- fuzzy line between different types of customers. Some people will buy a font with little coaxing, to be &quot;ethical&quot;. Most of these people would buy it even if they could &quot;steal&quot; some (in any case notably limited) renderings. Other people will very seldom pay for type - you have to lure them in. How? Exactly by letting them &quot;steal&quot; your Flash *renderings* (but not the font). You let them become dependent on a font, and many of them will eventually break down and buy the thing, to avoid all those time-consuming screen grabs, or maybe more significantly to eventually use the font for print. I thought about this a lot, and that's why I made my Shockwave renderings as clear as possible: exposure, and addiction. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lose the bars, dude.

This is something even Carter for one has said on various occasions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there might be a special case: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you're showing work-in-progress in public (like in Typophile's Critique forum), there's the issue of pre-release versions floating around, potentially causing great confusion.
