  body: ' While I&#39;m fond of the genre that you&#39;re drawing upon for inspiration
    for this poster, I would comment that it seems a bit much. Why not reduce the
    number of typographic elements &#40;for example, removing &#34;pro designer&#34;
    and/or &#34;performing live every sunday&#34;&#41; and focus instead on really
    tightening the overall composition with less typefaces. <BR> <BR>You also might
    consider more overprinting, which can really add to the aesthetic. <BR> <BR>If
    you&#39;re planning to actually print these, I&#39;ve had some success actually
    separating the plates and printing them separately. For example, if the poster
    is red and black, print all the red first, then load the paper back into the printer
    and print the black. <BR> <BR>jb '

    popular for a while and that it is not going to go out of style anytime soon.
    Nice work. What are the dimensions and use. <BR>Postcard, poster? '

  body: ' I keep waiting for a design brief that lends itself to just sending off
    the copy to Hatch Show Print in Nashville, and get them to post me back the finished
    job, reading for scanning. <BR> <BR>I did a bunch of research into ephemeral woodtype
    poster printing here in Ireland &#40;just as it was dying out&#41;, and was delighted
    to stumble across HSP in 1990. It&#39;s become something of a little industry
    since. '

  body: ' thanks guys ill take everything into consideration. i have a fear of white
    space and everything i do ends up looking really busy. the dimensions are approx
    8.5x11. im just printing it on my epson on some 110lb crap paper. so its basicly
    a flyer with some info on the back that i&#39;m folding twice and mailing in a
    small envelope that i have yet to make. '

    my inspiration comes from a couple of old motorcycle race posters my dad has in
    the garage. one is for a track called Ascot. '

  body: Go down to a shipping or stationary store and buy yourself a roll of brown
    package wrapping paper. They come in rolls about 3 feet wide, and make for a great
    cheap solution, although you&#39;ll need to flatten the paper before running it
    through a printer. <BR> <BR>Another alternate cheap paper source is printers masking
    paper, available by the roll at most hardware or paint stores. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s
    a few samples, run through a black&amp;white laser printer. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/881.gif"

  body: ' Overall, I&#39;m fond of it Phil and enjoy the Hatch/Rural Concert Poster
    look to it. I would say one of the fonts you&#39;ve selected really doesn&#39;t
    work as well as others in the poster. <BR> <BR>&#34;DON&#39;T MISS OUT!&#34;,
    &#34;See Samples . . .&#34;, &#34;Call Today w/ number&#34;, and &#34;Phil Foss&#34;
    are all in a Gill face or something similar and make the poster look like you
    didn&#39;t follow through to get the look consistant. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d recommend
    replacing that face with the one used for &#34;DESIGNER&#34; or a Clarendon of
    sorts. <BR> <BR>You may also consider further distressing the elements in the
    poster as well as printing it on really heavy uncoated paper and sending it flat.
    I&#39;ve had success with this technique for some mock Font Diner Airlines Luggage
    Tags I send out with one of my sets. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '
