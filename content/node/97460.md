  updating a series we do in Word to 2010 and an OTF. The note reference numbers in
  the series are \"special\" so in the 2003 template the Footnote Reference style
  was set to a different font than the Default Paragraph Font.\r\n\r\nFor use in the
  2010 template the new OTF font has a stylistic set for these \"special\" numbers
  that for some reason isn't getting applied to the embedded footnote or endnote references.\r\n\r\nIf
  I simply type a number and style that number as the Footnote Reference style the
  OpenType feature that is set in that style (Stylistic Set 1) is applied to the number.
  Likewise, if I create a style based on the Footnote Reference style, numbers to
  which that style is applied ALSO get the OpenType feature applied.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  the references for embedded footnotes and endnote do NOT get the OpenType feature
  applied even though when I select them they show they are styled with Footnote Reference,
  which has the OT feature applied and works on a regular number.\r\n\r\nThis happens
  on 2 machines with different versions of Windows.\r\n\r\nHas any one else seen anything
  similar? Seem like a bug?\r\n\r\nThanks very much,\r\nKen"
