  the Helsinki restaurant <a href=\"http://www.grotesk.fi/\">Grotesk</a> takes its
  name from the typeface used on its menu. The <em>Times'</em> exact words, that the
  restaurant is \"named for the type front [sic] used on its menu and not its look,\"
  do leave me with some doubts. I'm picturing here a menu set in some kind of blackletter,
  or thinking that perhaps something got lost in the translation.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant's
  website is set mostly in some slab serif, and the logo looks to be handrawn script.
  The place does occupy the former premises of the <em>Helsingin Sanomat</em>.\r\n\r\nAny
  Finns or people who've been by Helsinki recently who know the story?\r\n\r\nKiitos!\r\n"
