  Mardersteig (1892-1977) was an influential typographer, designer, and printer, best
  known for his work at the [[Officina Bodoni]] in Verona. His typefaces include Dante,
  Fontana, Griffo, Pacioli, and Zeno. Of these, unfortunately only Dante is available
  in digital form today. Dante is considered one of the most exceptionally beautiful
