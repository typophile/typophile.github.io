  body: Ali, this is so cool!  When you were talking about it in class, I wasn't really
    sure what you meant by slanting the type to show perspective, but now I see!  I
    think it really works well and definitely has the effect of being embedded into
    the picture.  Did you do this on the computer through scanning, or did you just
    hand letter?  With markers or something?  Are you planning to maybe color any
    letters in or add some with the computer?  It's looking really great!

  body: thanks! i hand lettered, scanned, and then brought it into photoshop to skew
    the perspective.  i may change the colors around (and color in some letters) but
    thank you!!!
