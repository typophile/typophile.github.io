  web) and see how would they look in different contexts - the \"Change Font Family
  Style\" Chrome Extension.\r\n\r\n1. Install the Google Chrome Web Browser (if you
  do not already have it) and the extension.\r\n3. Install your typeface.\r\n4. Open
  the extension's options and type the name of your typeface in the only field.\r\n\r\nAll
  pages that you open will be rendered with your typeface, instead of the original
  ones.\r\n\r\nIf you think some of them look better, post a pic."
