body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nMost SWFTE fonts were knockoffs of commercial typefaces. I'm
  wondering whether that is true of their \"Thomas Paine,\" and if so, what it was
  a knockoff of.\r\n\r\nSee it at: http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/11599\r\n\r\nOne
  source I found claimed it was based on ATF's Packard Antique, but they don't seem
  all that close to me (e.g. see \"A\" and \"a\").\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Vintage Type offers their version as a <a href='http://www.vintagetype.com/'
    target='_blank'>wonderful set</a>. Years ago, before they refined the fonts and
    filled out the set, they offered a basic version as shareware and called it Rosabel.
    I wouldn't be surprised if that was what SWFTE renamed and called their own.
