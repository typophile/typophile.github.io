  title=\"We Love You So \u2013 Where The Wild Things Are \u2013 Spike Jonze - Pictorial
  Webster\u2019s Will Blow Your Mind!!!\"><em>Where The Wild Things Are</em> production
  blog</a>, I found this delightful short film documenting <a href=\"http://www.quercuspress.com/\"
  title=\"Quercus Press\">John Carrera</a>'s decade-long effort to revive a century-old
  Pictorial Webster's reference book...\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/5228616\">Pictorial
  Webster's: Inspiration to Completion</a></strong> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user1882107\">John
  Carrera</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.\r\n<em>From the discovery
  of the 1898 International Dictionary to linotyping the entries to printing the last
  print on the vandercook to cutting the fingertabs of the deluxe edition, this video
  gives a quick overview of the process of creating the Pictorial Webster's fine press
  edition.</em>\r\n\r\nVery much worth watching!"
