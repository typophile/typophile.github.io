  body: "As Mark Simonson pointed out Bee is URW\u2019s name for the old VGC \u201CB\u201D
    series. The \"B\" fonts run from B-1 to B-18 and run from a super thin to a heavy
    black in one of my old Visual Graphics Corp catalogs. "

  body: "To clear the air once and for all, the Bee fonts were dupes of Filmotype
    originals originally called Gable, Galaxy, Garfield, and Giant (There are others
    in this family but I've only listed the ultra condensed weights) . . .\r\n\r\nAs
    far as VGC goes, in order to hide the shame of their pirating and reselling of
    the Filmotype library, the fonts were simply renamed alphanumerically and listed
    at the back of most VGC catalogs . . . As you may be aware, the fonts ranged from
    B-1 to B-15 . . .\r\n\r\nFrom there, they became the Bee named fonts and while
    I'm not certain who named them that way,  I saw them named that way was in a De-Line-O-Type
    catalog that had them listed as such.\r\n\r\nIn fact, these fonts were copied
    by many typesetters and included in their catalogs and most cases the names were
    changed in order to retain an heir of exclusivity for clients who spec'd out fonts
    by name only to find there would only be one shop in town with the correct font
    and were awarded the job . . .\r\n\r\nOne such example of this is by Andreson,
    a major typesetter on the West Coast who ran 11 shops in their heyday. The renamed
    these fonts Motion Picture B-1 to B-15 (referencing VGCs numbers) - Ironically
    they ended up setting most of the movie poster titling since they were the only
    shop in town with those fonts . . .\r\n\r\nStuart :D"
