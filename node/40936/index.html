  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all - I am doing an OT font in FLS 5. It has only latin characters plus the four figure sets with accompanying currencies etc and numr/dmom sets along with a handful of ligatures. That is, I guess, as simple as it gets. When I generate my font and use it in InDesign, the OT features are bracketed, i.e. unavailable. I have read other threads here and tried to paste text like "languagesystem DFLT dflt;" into the OT panel in FLS, but it never works, it only sometimes gives me an error message. 

It must be a simple problem, and I realise that I am ignorant, but I would really appreciate if someone could give me clues to a solution ...

I have designed the font with all characters, but the testing in FSL is not of much use since I can't find out how to change between for instance the different figure sets. 

I was sort of hoping that there might be some basic coding publicly available that I could paste into my OT panel. It ought to be the same thing for most fonts like mine that don't have many special features. It would, I think, also be in the interest of the people behind  the OT technology, that OT fonts get on the market and function correctly. 

As I am not a full time type designer, I can't spend that much time on figuring out technical stuff in fonts far beyond the actual drawing and spacing of letters. I hardly get any income from all the hours of work on my fonts, as is surely the case for many of my colleagues. But maybe the OT-people actually have made that kind of coding, and I just haven't found it yet ... he said wishfully. </div>

And there is. <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.3bb58628">Minion Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.3bb7c828">Bickham Script Pro</a>'s features files have been available for quite some time now.

In any case, I'm including the code below that will get your four sets of figures working. Copy and save it in a file with a .fea extension. Then it's just a matter of opening it from the OT panel in FLS. (Before trying to compile the code and start getting errors, make sure the glyph names used in it match the glyph names in your font)
