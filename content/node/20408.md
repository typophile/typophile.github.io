body: I'm working on my first font that was built entirely in fontlab and after generating
  an OT type 1 file I noticed that the letters that are overlapping in my script face
  are causing negative spaces. I've tryed converting all outlines into type 1 curves
  twice but it's still happening. I had this problem at the beginning but the first
  time, converting all to type 1 curves fixed the problem but now it's not working.
  Attached is an image of what's happening.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/connection_problems_3607.gif]

    there's no problem with the overlap 'ed', but the 'er' one has problems.\r\n\r\nFont
    cache problems, maybe?"

  body: I always remove the ot files and do a computer restart to clear everything
    out of the cache so it's doubtful that's the problem. Are the little grey arrows
    at the edge of the outlines showing the direction? What direction should a type
    1 outline be going in, to the left or right? I noticed that the e grey arrow was
    going in one direction and the r.end was going in another so I guess I should
    go in and manually fix them. Isn't there a button to push in fontlab to make this
    happen automatically. Using the Convert to Type 1 tool doesn't change the direction.

    go to Tools-->Action Set, and them from the Available actions chose 'Contour direction'.
    Click the button with the arrow and select the correct option. Hit Run."

    true, especially if you're using Adobe apps, (which i assume you are). you need
    to find any files named adobefnt.lst and trash em.\r\n\r\n<em>Are the little grey

    FLS5 there is. or you can select all your glyphs and then go to Contour>Paths>Set

    beziers."
