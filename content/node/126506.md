  and 'FINE WINE, SPIRITS...' for a logo we need to recreate for a client. I'm thinking
  they're very possibly from a default font list sometime in the late 90's-early aughts
  and vertically scaled, but I'm stumped. I don't think it's custom, and of course
  this is of course the highest res version we could find. Any leads would be greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\n"
