  body: "Thank you for your help.  I spent a long time trying to identify this font,
    using \" My Fonts\" etc\r\n  I have never ever posted on the internet before,as
    I am a complete novice,  and I was pleased to see replies,  unfortunately I must
    \ request a new password every time I attempt to log in to this site. I was so
    pleased to see a such a good match displayed as De Vinne,  but when I got the
    fonts and installed them, they were so different to the example type displayed
    on \"My Fonts\"  - had a curly tail on the Q  etc.    I am quite baffled now and
    ready to give up on my interest in typefaces,  it is just too difficult. However
    in the meantime any help would still be appreciated.  by the way is the typeface
    in the rest of the document the same as the Large Capitals."

  body: There are several fonts called "DeVinne" in the world to make it confusing.
    The one with the curly tail is perhaps a Bitstream variant. If you note above
    character display,  the Wood Type De Vinne Regular has the straight tail as in
    your sample. It is conceivable you were sent the wrong font so you should check
    your purchase.

  body: The typefaces in the example shown are original DeVinne (and derivates) cuts,
    from the original Gustav Schroeder design released by Central Type Foundry in
    1890. The style continued to be popular as a text face up to the 1920s.
