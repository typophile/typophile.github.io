body: "Hi everybody. \r\n\r\nI'm brand new to these fora, although I have come across
  them in the past as I am - unsurprisingly - a typophile and love exploring and looking
  for 'interesting' fonts.\r\n\r\nThe reason I've started this thread, however, is
  to enquire about the PF Champion Script Pro for Greek letters. I intend to get a
  tattoo incorporating different ideas, symbols, and representations of personal liberty
  and the journey to reaching a state of freedom (intellectually, spiritually, mentally
  and so on). I see this as an expressive art project on my natural body canvas -
  much in the way some of you, like I, may regard fonts as artistic - and I take it
  very seriously. I feel that the PF Champion Pro Script is the most fitting and beautiful
  script for the Ancient Greek quote '\u03B3\u03BD\u1FF6\u03B8\u03B9 \u03C3\u03B1\u03C5\u03C4\u03CC\u03BD'
  ['know thyself'] (all lower case).\r\n\r\nThe problem is I lack the resources (and
  erudite knowledge, as it were) to purchase the font package and in general to know
  how to go about this. I'm afraid I (begrudgingly) feel the need to rely on the altruism
  of fellow typophiles here. Is anybody here have who has the font in Greek and is
  willing to send me a file via e-mail of the Ancient Greek quote above? I would be
  unspeakably grateful for the help (and I don't expect to be particularly successful!).\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be MUCH welcome. A thousand thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n(P.S. as the AG
  alphabet is polytonic and may not be supported by PF Champion Script Pro, even just
  '\u03B3\u03BD\u03C9\u03B8\u03B9 \u03C3\u03B1\u03C5\u03C4\u03BF\u03BD' without any
  accents is equally fine.)"

  body: Note that in the MyFonts preview, you won't get advanced OpenType layout,
    so you may be missing some features of Champion Greek that you would get in e.g.
    InDesign.

    the job done right.\r\nA typographer with the good taste and know-how to choose
    the appropriate alternates and swashes -- otherwise you will have a plain and
    dreary setting of the text, when you could have had something exceptional, given
    the potential of such a font."

  body: Cool down, boys - a free spirit was just looking for a template to get his
    skin mutilated. Crinkling skin in years to come will cause kerning and spacing
    problems anyway.

  body: "I'm coming to terms with the notion that someone with a classical education,
    informed about grammar if not OpenType, would settle for default in something
    as permanent as a tattoo. If the font was Helvetica, it wouldn't matter, but with
    a calligraphic style in an OpenType font, there are options (as you can see by
    looking at the Champion pro PDF), more so than for these:\r\n\r\nhttp://hubpages.com/hub/Tattoo_Ideas_Greek_Words_Phrases\r\n\r\n
    I would think a swash on the theta would be very cool. And if you did that, then
    you may want to use the \"ascender\" tau, to balance the two words. \r\n\r\n"
