body: "The first one is probably impossible to figure out - it's an E rotated forward
  90 degrees and blown up as a \"decoration\" on my website, but I have changed the
  design now. My AD and I had sort of a falling out over the site and he has not shared
  the information about what font this is. I think the other one - CONTACT -  is Century
  Gothic but I might be wrong.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BFB 714_6438.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6288.gif]"
