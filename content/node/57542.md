  a relationship, eh?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nok, here's a new question for all of you...\r\n\r\nfollowing
  an unspoken rule, printed books\r\nalways use the same measure on every page.\r\n\r\nin
  an electronic-book, on the other hand,\r\nthe measure can be set independently for\r\neach
  page, according to the length of its\r\nlongest line (or the second longest line)...\r\n\r\nso
  -- just off the top of your head now --\r\nwhat would you think of doing it that
  way?\r\n\r\nlater i'll show you a book where it's done,\r\nso you can see what it
  actually looks like,\r\nand make a judgment on the results, but\r\nfor now, how
  does the _idea_ strike you?\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n\r\n"

    Unless you really do have a highly eccentric name. This isn't the end of the world
    but it does tend to give your profile and certain questionable air. I encourage
    you to change this. \r\n\r\nAs to the idea, I don't love it because I don't really
    like justified text. I like ragged right far better, and particularly on a screen.
    There are all kinds of complex rendering related reasons for this. Still, I suppose
    I am open to having mind mind changed if I see something that impresses me."

    i have no information to go on.  it might very well be that\r\nany violation of
    an unwritten rule will make him feel that way.\r\n\r\nheck, i myself felt a bit
    queasy when i first thought of it, just\r\nbecause it seems so unorthodox.  but
    after a while, i decided\r\nthat it wasn't that big of a deal at all.  of course,
    any time that\r\nyou deviate from pure compulsiveness while laying out a book,\r\ncosts
    must be paid.  the question is whether benefits outweigh.\r\nin this case, i think
    tighter lines outweigh the variable measure.\r\nat least to the degree that i'm
    willing to extend the experiment.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nricardo said:\r\n>   Don\u2019t

    that\r\nmany of you go out of their way to tell me your lack of interest.\r\n\r\nheck,
    ricardo, you did it just now...\r\n\r\nbesides, i just wanted to see if there
    was a mass of objections,\r\nand learn the specific nature of whatever objections
    there are...\r\ni think it's pretty clear there is no mass.  so even if the absence\r\nis
    due to \"lack of interest\", it continues to be meaningful to me.\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I meant that it was distracting and disruptive. Seemed like the worst of
    both worlds.  \r\n\r\nJustification always leads to compromise in internal spacing.
    The reason one accepts such compromises -- the payoff -- is to have consistent,
    orderly margins and text blocks, relatively fixed from page to page. A fixed framework
    removes some of the external variables and allows focus to remain on the internal.
    \r\n\r\nFlush-left/ragged-right exchanges the priority, preferring internal consistency
    in spacing, and accepting a variable margin.\r\n\r\nYour sample had highly variable
    internal spacing married with constantly changing external margins. The changing
    margin was actually made more noticeable by the hard line of the alignment.\r\n\r\nI
    can imagine a changing measure working acceptably if the range of variation was
    kept quite small, so as to be essentially unnoticeable. But I'm not sure you'd
    gain anything by it."

    in an e-book, any change in variation will be\r\n\"noticeable\", because of the
    end-user's ability to\r\nrapidly thumb through the exactly-placed pages.\r\nit's
    quite easy to actually see the margins shifting.\r\n\r\nin a p-book, the normal
    vagaries of printing will\r\nmake any such variation be much less noticeable,\r\nsince
    the margins will be less exact to begin with,\r\nand the inability to compare
    pages directly means\r\nchanges in the margins would be harder to detect.\r\n\r\nbut
    e-books is what i'm interested in...\r\n\r\n\r\n>   Your sample had highly variable
    internal spacing\r\n\r\nyou will remember that that was due in large part\r\nto
    the nature of that experiment, which was to test\r\nif justification could be
    done without hyphenation.\r\n\r\nif i'd used hyphenation with a variable measure,\r\nthe
    \"compromise\" you talked about will not only\r\nnot be as bad as usual, it will
    actually be better,\r\nbecause most lines are not stretched as much...\r\n\r\nbut
    that's really beside the point, because my aim\r\nwas to see whether those three
    factors together --\r\njustification-on, hyphenation-off, variable-measure\r\n--
    would balance out.  so your conclusion that it is\r\n\"the worst of both worlds\"
    is directly relevant to me,\r\nand i thank you so much  for sharing your impression.\r\n\r\nit's
    kinda hard to have a conversation amidst all this\r\nhyperventilation, isn't it?

    And I have to agree with Sorkin. It <em>is</em> a convention to use your real
    name here. When I first started, I too used a handle. Someone made a similar comment
    to me, so I changed it to my real name. In fact, I think I contacted [[http://typophile.com/user/108|Tiffany
    Wardle de Sousa]] directly, and she changed it within the hour. It's also possible
    to keep your username and just add your real name to [[http://typophile.com/user/42797|your
    profile]]. Immediately after doing this I got more and better responses to my
    questions and feedback. I strongly encourage you to do the same."
