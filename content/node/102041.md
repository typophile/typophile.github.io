body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a problem with the line gap of my font when using it on windows
  7 with Wordpad (no problem on open office and on my mac).\r\n\r\nI made a  font
  family with 4 styles (regular, italic, bold and bold italic) and when I use it with
  Wordpad, I ended up with unconsistent linegap. Italic, bold & bold italic have the
  same line gap but regular has a larger one.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI use Fontlab to
  made the font and my settings in \"Truetype Specific metrics\" are the same for
  all 4 styles (see below).\r\n\r\nOS/2 TypoAscender = 1600\r\nOS/2 TypoDescender
  = -500\r\nOS/2 TypoLineGap = 400\r\nOS/2 WinAscent = 1900\r\nOS/2 WinDescent = -600\r\nhhea
  Ascender = 1900\r\nhhea Descender = -600\r\nhhea LineGap = 0\r\n\r\nA screenshot
  of the regular and bold version at the same size :\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/1i3E2C0Y1F0T2c3d3V31/linegap-problem.png\"
  border=\"0\" />\r\n\r\nI tried various settings in \"Truetype Specific metrics\"
  but none of them solve the issue. I don't know why the line gap calculated by wordpad
  is different for regular and bold despite that they have the same settings\u2026
  Maybe you know\u2026\r\n\r\nSorry for my english\u2026 I hope someone could help
  me !"

  body: "Just some thoughts for you to consider:\r\n1. Are you absolutely certain
    that the largest numbers in your Regular are 1900 and -600? Did you do a Recalculation
    to check that weight?\r\n2. Does your Wordpad file have a Carriage Return at the
    end of the last line? A long shot but it may affect it.\r\n3. Have you tried it
    with both LineGap settings at zero? I know this is contrary to all recommendations
    but it may force Wordpad to work with it. If you changed this number you would
    also have to set your Typo numbers to match Win & hhea. It will affect your output
    in all apps.\r\n\r\nAssuming this is a font you are making for sale, if it were
    my font I wouldn't worry about using it in Wordpad. How many people use Wordpad
    in an office or professional setting?"

  body: "OK, now this one's a longshot, but did you cache the VDMX table? If your
    autohinting is off, that could cause weird settings in the VDMX. This would only
    happen at some sizes, though, so if you see the issue at a large range of sizes,
    that's not the cause. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "It may be a problem with the bounding box.\r\nIn FontLab:\r\n> Metrics and
    Dimensions > Key dimensions\r\n\r\nFont BBox: (-xxx, -<strong>xxx</strong>) -
    (xxxx, <strong>xxx</strong>)\r\n\r\nMake sure that the y-axis/vertical values
    (which I have indicated in bold) are the same for every font.\r\n\r\nGo through
    all the glyphs and check the position of the highest (usually the ring accent
    over cap A) and lowest details\u2014these are used to determine the bounding box."

  body: "Thank you for your replies !\r\n\r\n@George Thomas:\r\n1. I check my vertical
    dimension and effectively 1900 is not my largest number, it's 1929.\r\n2. Not
    a problem with a carriage return.\r\n3. I havn't tried to set the 2 linegap to
    0, will try it to see if it change something.\r\n\r\nI tried my font on wordPad
    because I didn't have word on PC (I work on a mac) and I assume that if there
    is an issue in wordPad, this issue may appear on other software as well.\r\n\r\n@jasonc
    :\r\nI have the issue at all sizes\u2026\r\n\r\n@Nick Shinn:\r\nMy Font BBox are
    different, see the values below:\r\nRegular: (-99, -710) - (3132, 1920)\r\nItalic:
    (-139, -711) - (3070, 1920)\r\nBold: (-130, -710) - (3141, 1928)\r\nBold Italic:
    (-198, -711) - (3235, 1929)\r\n\r\nDo I need to change my font design to fit in
    the same bounding box ?\r\n\r\nI will do more test today, and I'll let you know
    if I make any progress ! \r\n\r\nAgain, thank you !"

  body: I think styles of the same family and size master should share the same em
    proportions. This does not mean, e.g. the heights or depths of all the glyphs
    need to be the exactly the same, but they should be fairly close.

  body: "I tried various \"Truetype specific settings\" but none of them fix the issue.
    I change the tallest glyphs in the bold version so that regular and bold fit in
    the same bounding box (xxx, -710) - (xxx, 1920) but it didn't change anything.
    I tried to set the 2 linegap to 0\u2026 same result.\r\n\r\nIf someone has another
    idea I'll take it!"

    \"1/4\", so my guess is that the original hinting of the glyph \"1\" and \"4\"
    cause the issue\u2026 Does it make sense to you ?"
