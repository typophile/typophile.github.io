  THANKS in advance!\r\n\r\nBelow is a spread I'd like to include in my book. The
  topic here is retro costume influences. I'd like to refer to the silent film era
  and the Art Nouveau classics of Mucha. How do I find out if I'm allowed to use these
  100-year-old images?\r\n\r\nOn the left is an image of an obscure (in this country)
  silent film star with the look I wanted. I found the high-res image posted on a
  Flickr site that was an homage to the era. I asked the owner where this image came
  from, if it was copyrighted, and could I print it. Got no response, which makes
  me wonder if it IS copyrighted. \r\n\r\nOn the right are Mucha art images I've seen
  on several websites, but will printing them high-res (in black and white) get me
  into trouble with the Mucha Museum, for instance?  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/14-15_6406.jpg]"

    messy depending on what country you\u2019re in, what country the item was created/copyrighted
    in, and whether or not the copyrights have been renewed over the years. But there\u2019s
    a nasty catch\u2014reproductions of the images are copyrighted. For example, you
    can\u2019t just scan a photo out of a book to reproduce without permission; you
    would need to photograph or scan a work yourself.\r\n\r\nI would be very careful
    about reprinting the images from Flickr. Sure they might be posted by someone
    scanning his antique photos, but they could also be Corbis stock photos that got
    posted to the internet. If you really need to use them and can\u2019t get clear
    copies, consult a copyright lawyer before you print them. As for the Mucha images,
    contact the museum; most museums will sell you their images for very reasonable
    fees that they very much deserve given the cost and effort of preserving and photographing."

    I add my personal experience with this: most (so far, all!) musea are used to
    this kind of requests, and will promptly send you an incredibly high quality scan
    or photograph. It's always a joy to see something like that popping into my mail
    box -- I always zoom in on every tiny detail, to really appreciate individual
    brush strokes from up close. Not something you could pull off in a museum, peering
    over paintings with a huge magnifier."

    when someone makes a dingbat font with approximations of famous faces and images
    in high contrast? Like, I don't know, Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe?  Is that a

  body: For type issues... we got heavyweights. But for licensing vintage images,
    even copyright lawyers must often do extensive research to track down the origins
    or rights of an image. Unless the image is well-known, it will be a matter of
    research. And sometimes no one knows for sure (e.g., the library of congress...
    even they don't know about the rights to many of their images).

    type of <em>fair use</em> of copyrighted material, eg \"quoting\" and illustration
    in certain works. If you do not use illustrations per se, but in the course of
    an evaluation or such, you may use an image, providing it is not too large (in
    the sense that the illustration is not the main item on a page, I guess).\r\nI
    know this is kind of a gray area, but there are many precedents.\r\n\r\nIn your

    hi-res enough that you can see if there are halftone dots? If so, the person who
    posted it probably scanned it out of a book. In that case, continue your online
    research in the hope of finding the publisher, and contact them, because if any
    copyright records exist, a publisher is the most likely to have them. \r\n\r\n<em>What
    about when someone makes a dingbat font with approximations of famous faces and

    doesn't protect fonts, but it does protect photographs.\r\n\r\n<em>if you say
    I actually have to consult a copyright lawyer (at considerable expense, I\u2019m
    sure) I will leave those 3 images out.</em>\r\n\r\nA worst-case scenario is that
    you take a chance, publish the picture in the book, and it is seen by a someone
    who turns out to be a legitimate copyright holder, and he/she successfully sues
    to have all copies of your book recalled from bookstores at your expense and destroyed,
    along with all copies in your own inventory, preventing you from earning back
    any of the money you invested in printing and binding. Now <em>that's</em> a considerable
    expense. \r\n\r\nThe good news is, that's very unlikely to happen with such an
    old and obscure image. But my advice is, never gamble more than you can afford
