body: "I'm doing a project at university about the development of the [[interrobang]].
  So far I have found out who designed it etc, and that it is made up of a ? and !.
  Now I am trying to find out how the ! and ? came about. So far I have found that
  the ! developed from the latin 'io', meaning 'joy', but I can't find any specific
  information about the question mark. I have found a couple of theories, one that
  says it developed from a 'Q', and another that says it developed from a 'Q' and
  an 'o'. Can anyone help me verify this? Or have I got my informatiuon completly
  wrong??!\r\n\r\nI would also like to find out how these letters (the i, o and q)
  developed and arrived in the alphabet, so if anyone knows any good sites for information
  that would be good! Although I am more stuck on the development of the ! and ?,
  so any information anyone has on those would be great please! (i have checked wikipedia
  btw! :) )"

  body: The usual theory on the question mark is that it evolved from a Q, latin for
    Questio...  If you look at a swash Q, like Caslon, you will get the idea. I don't
    know about the exclamation.

  body: "I did some research on this topic some years ago for my typography book.
    In the end I didn't include any of these vague theories. So far there seems to
    be no bulletproof theory about the origin of question mark and exclamation mark.
    Which is of course surprising, since these signs are rather young compared to
    period, colon and so on. \r\nThe origin in Questio and Io sounds reasonable, but
    I never saw any handwritten document from that time, that would support this theory.
    You can find some very old examples of the question mark in \xBBPause and Effect:
    Punctuation in the West\xAB. The shapes are really remarkable and very different
    from our upright form today. \r\n\r\nRalf \r\n"

    modern exclamation point:\r\nhttp://textwrap.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\nIt makes more
    sense than io, which means something more like \"hey!\" in Latin.\r\n\r\nI remain
    unconvinced that the interrobang has legs. It was a nice idea, but it has hobbled
    along for years, unrecognized and unadopted by the public."

    slant was, in turn, derived from Greek writing. The influence of the Byzantine
    tradition in southern Italian Christianity persisted long after the schism. I
    recently heard a recoding of Beneventan liturgical chant, and more of it was in
    Greek than in Latin. And of course the Beneventan letter a is indistinguishable
    from a Greek alpha."

    ? has been around in various forms ever since c. AD 800. It was also used as an
    exclamation mark before something different, more like ! first appeared in Italy
    in the late 14th c. None of these marks have anything to do with abbreviations,
    or the Beneventan script, to the best of my knowledge (I believe the slant mentioned
    above only refers to the stem of d, and there is nothing specifically Greek about
    that)."

    I were not referring to the angled stem of the Beneventan d but to the angle at
    which the broad nib is held relative to the horizontal. In most western scripts,
    the angle is fairly close to 45 degrees, but in eastern scripts, including the
    Byzantine cursive Greek, it is steeper and, in some cases, may even rotate past
    the vertical. The Beneventan script is a kind of hybrid.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether
    Alessandro is accurate in saying that the distinctive arrangement of thicks and
    thins in some question marks is derived directly from the Beneventan script. But
    I am confident that many of the characteristics of the Beneventan script are derived
    from those of Greek scripts with which the scribes of Monte Cassino were certainly
    familiar."

  body: 'John, sorry I got you wrong (I still think Alessandro meant what he said,
    i.e. angled stems, an idea he got from the Wikipedia article he links to). Still,
    Beneventan has a normal Latin pen angle and its letterforms are based on later
    Roman cursive. Bits & pieces of Greek occur within Latin texts in Beneventan manuscripts
    (F. Newton, The scriptorium and library at Monte Cassino 1058-1105, Cambridge
    1999, p.198) but I can''t see Greek writing having any influence on the Beneventan
    script itself. Anyway, to move back to punctuation, Beneventan mss were rather
    late (11th c.) in adopting question marks at the end of sentences: before that
    they used special intonation marks on single words within the question. Of course
    medieval punctuation on the whole is about intonation rather than syntax. And
    it wasn''t done with the full breadth of the nib (apart from dots), rather with
    a light touch, hairlines from the corner of the nib and so on.'
