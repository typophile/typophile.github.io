body: What kind of jobs are out there for typography students and how do you go about
  getting into them?  On my graphic design course they are always telling us who's
  who in advertising and branding and what's on offer...but what about those of us
  who love type?

  body: "I think if you somehow manage to get into publishing, that's the closest
    thing to a 'typographer' these days. But you still have to do covers and  such.
    I just got a job at a publishing company, and if the love of what you do *and
    can prove it* comes across, seemed to work for me. My goal is to one day work
    at a private 'press' or something...DRG or Hyphen or something like that...\r\n\r\nGood
    luck"

  body: Everyone seems to say publishing...which I do enjoy, but what I am really
    interested in is information design, especially pictograms.
