  here's my first post. Thanks in advance for any help you may offer.\r\n\r\nI have
  this great book, Swiss Graphic Design, by Richard Hollis and want to know what typeface
  is used in the small Emil Ruder poster on this page. It could have been hand-drawn
  for the poster, but maybe a digital version has been drawn with a full character
  set. Who knows.\r\n\r\nPoster is here is same image as attached image.\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=NQKgLGhFvWAC&pg=PA190&lpg=PA190&dq=glass+emil+ruder+poster&source=web&ots=pthQzDKWWT&sig=0FjUm538Z-mZi4F0eTCdlWbIZuc&hl=en\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nmatt"

  body: oh i meant the little poster to the left with the very compressed "glas" and
    the severely angled 'a'... sorry for not being more specific.

  body: 'The closest I can think of to that would be Helvetica UltraCompressed but
    not a match, obviously. Tried looking for ''wood type'' on google but didn''t
    find anything closer. I''m sorry for being a complete plonker and not reading
    your question correctly. '

    none of them match the 'a' very well.\r\n\r\nCould it be hand drawn? It's from

  body: "I had a look at some of his other posters on the site I sent you above (the
    Swiss National Library poster collection) where you can zoom into the picture.
    While, as you say, on a number of them the letters are obviously hand-drawn, another
    Ruder poster \"Die Zeitung\" using the same compressed wood type does look (to
    me, at least) like a proper typeface. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/zeitung_4274.jpg]\r\nNo
    idea which one, though."
