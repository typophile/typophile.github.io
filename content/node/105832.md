body: 'My college newspaper has asked me to update the fonts for them. They currently
  use Kepler for the the masthead and body copy, and Trade Gothic for the headlines
  and bylines. The editor-in-chief wants the paper to look urban and modern, similar
  to the Chicago Reader. I am recommending Intro Inline for the Masthead, Lubalin
  Graph for the headlines and bylines, and Utopia for the body copy. Are these fonts
  appropriate? '

  body: "Intro is fine for the nameplate (but are you sure you want it to be THAT
    close to the Chicago Reader?), Utopia is a sturdy enough classic for text, but
    I'd strongly advice against using Lubalin Graph \u2013 it's painfully dated-looking.
    The subeditors will thank you for something with a narrower body as well."
