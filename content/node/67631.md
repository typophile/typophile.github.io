  on Google, and the search here wasn't working.\r\n\r\nI have a font that is available
  to download for free for non-commercial work at dafont.com. Someone just asked if
  they could use the font for a logo for a restaurant. I really don't know how much
  I should charge. Being that it will be in a logo makes me think it should be relatively
  higher priced than if it was being used for a t-shirt or something. Any ideas on
  an average price to ask?"

  body: 'Something to consider: maybe he''s asking for this font because, since it''s
    free for non-commercial use, he''s expecting you to charge less than a commercial
    font would cost. So I wouldn''t charge too much, or else you might lose the business
    when he decides that if he''s going to have to pay that much anyway then he should
    use a different font.'

  body: "House Industries charges more for licenses for fonts used in national logos
    or large scale ad campaigns and sign usage. But, that's House Industries whose
    product is outside of my budget. T-shirts or a logo for a local restaurant what
    is the difference? Just out of curiosity, why do you have the font up on Dafont.
