    body: I checked... their web site doesn't list the options and their examples
      have many different types of fonts.  I sent them an email a couple of weeks
      ago, but no reply as yet.   I appreciate the help.  Thank you!

  body: "First off, both stones do <em>not</em> use the same font. Just look at the
    E's, among other things.\r\n\r\nLooking solely at the bottom stone, I don't find
    a match. Similar in very different ways than Don's suggestions is <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-880/'
    target='_blank'>\r\nTelegraph Modern</a> by Walter Tracy, 1969."

  body: Yep - see it, the E's are different.  That's why I posted here for the experts
    to weigh in and correct me. So let me shift my request a bit to identify the font
    on the more recent stone... that would be the top one with Thomas A. Wigle.

  body: "The monument companies use special fonts that work with their engraving machines.\r\nSome
    research with other monument engravers should turn up a match, and perhaps a complete
    alphabet. I do know that the names they use are not necessarily the same as those
    for retail digital fonts. In this case the letters do not seem to correspond to
    any single retail font.\r\nDon"

  body: "Mr. Wigle,\r\n\r\nI apologize, I did not recall seinf an email prior to yesterday's
    contact form, which I will be responding to shortly.  We toughened up our spam
    filter a few months ago, and evidently it might be a tad too strict. \r\n\r\nThe
    letter style on the flat marker for Joy and Mattie is Modified Roman which is
    an older more traditional letter style, the letter style on your Thomas' memorial
    is alled Condensed Roman.  This is a more modern letter style that became our
    standard sometime later.\r\n\r\nI apologize for missing the prior email, but as
    I said, I will reply to yesterday's email momentarily. \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nTrent
    Wichman\r\nWichman Monuments, Inc."
