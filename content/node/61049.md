  numerals. This typeface is made for text.I would like to know if there are  special
  consideratons i should have when designing numerals for a neoclasical face.\r\n\r\nAnd
  concerning the number 4, is the open 4 more suited for sans serif typefaces? or,
  what is the origin of this \"open\" 4? Do you know if there are classic typefaces
  with this kind of four.\r\n\r\nBooks, links, examples... all will be wellcome.\r\n\r\nthankyou\r\n\r\nL.\r\n\r\n(Attached

    situation.\r\nOpen 4 is work only when all number are on the base line.\r\n\r\nI
    think it interesting that you ass, what is the origin of \"open\"4, I was look
    up on Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%28number%29\"> Link
    </a>\r\nThey shown the changing of number 4. Anyway I think \"open\" 4 has something
    to do with invented of pocket calculators and digital watches, because to distinguish
    \"close\" 4 and number 9. maybe i'm wrong, thats what i read from Wikipedia. hehheeh"

  body: That Wikipedia story about 4 v. 9 on a calculator may very well be true, but
    the open form of 4 goes back much further. Many copperplate scripts from the 18th
    century have open 4s. The form might be even older than that.

    make \u0447 than 4, when you write fast."
