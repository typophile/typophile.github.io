  font meant for text sizes, I'd appreciate any constructive criticism. The goal is
  to make a readable magazine-friendly typeface that appears very crisp and curvy\u2014
  maybe even floral. "

  body: That's a great start! I really like the g. I think the bowl of your /a/ could
    use some more didot'ness. Meaning the top part of the bowl going in a more horizontal
    direction, but perhaps that's just personal flavour. I think you should give the
    /y/ a round terminal. The way it is now really looks out of place to me. It would
    probably be better for legibility if you make the arm of the /r/ end more open,
    so that the terminal points in a more horizontal direction, instead of downwards.
    That way you could also make it more compressed which would make IMO a better
    texture. For comfortable reading at small pntsizes, it would probably help if
    you make all thin lines a little thicker. Keep going!

    work, though.\r\nYou might want to extend the baseline serif of r on the right
    to help fill in that gap."
