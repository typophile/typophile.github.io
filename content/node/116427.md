  a warning or explanation that blog posting would be suspended or disabled. Is this
  affecting anyone else? "

    things pick up.\r\nWith the relaunch, is there any chance of recovering the blog
    data? I had been using it to document when I caught my fonts in use in the world,
    I think. There are plenty of other places to post a blog these days, but at least
    for historical purposes could we dig up the old stuff?"
