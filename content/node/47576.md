  and tactis of the participants are pretty dam funny as well. It seems as though
  elections are a manifestation of the fountain of youth considering that it makes
  fifty and sixty year old men and women  behave like they're five year old children.Everthing
  from the mud slinging, the backstabbing, the alliances, and the buttons, is reminiscent
  of days I spent in middle school. Rediculous, isn't it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI kind of
  have the same opinion of my country that I do of my state, a type of love/hate relationship.
  I love the people, the diversity, the entrepeneurial spirit, but I do not agree
  with it's politics, nor the \"notion\" that we are actually \"free\". I do believe
  that our country has strayed too far from the original ideas of it's founding fathers
  and in turn has taken power away from it's citizens and has created an imperealistic
  way of governing."

    in the political process, state your opinion with words, letters, phone calls,
    votes and most important, your pocket book you give up your freedom to the corporate
    bodies willing to use all those methods of influence. The corporate bodies want
    you docile, meek, and uninterested. Our lack of freedom is our choice until we
    decide to give it away too. Politics is a give and take and the US is 51% left
    and 51% right depending on the weather, the question, and the statistical analyst.
    Everything is normal and as it was before. The founding fathers did not allow
    women to vote, or non land owners. If we change it back would we have a better
    system than now? Americans can change the country and its direction, that is the
    beauty and the ugly of America depending on which 51% you are.\r\n\r\nThe internet
    is the best platform ever for the growing political action groups that have goals,
    plans, and direction. Find one you like and use all the tools that you have not
    been using to get your voice heard. At the end of the day the politicians will
    make choices that tend to please their supporters and sponsors, their careers,
    and their country. If they do not do it the way we like we can replace them like
    California did with old governor what\u2019s his name. The structure is set up
    so we can not change things too fast which is healthy but requires the public
    to be on their toes year after year governing the government."

  body: "i cannot agree with the voting aspect...those that say if you do not vote,
    you have no right to bitch are in fact a bunch of undereducated asses..I've grown
    up in Louisiana politics for my entire life..I will say that if I choose not to
    vote, according to the current political system, I am still a TAX PAYER! I have
    been given the right, whether I choose to vote or not!, to voice my own opinions
    and to also disagree with my government.\r\n\r\nI am in no way saying anything
    ill, just re-iderating my thought and ideals that \"represent\" me and my people"

  body: What legal tool do you have besides your voice, and your vote? What more powerful
    tool do you have than your pocket book? Are you the only one unsatisfied? Get
    organized like the ones are that you do not like. The beauty of the USA is that
    you will not go to jail for it and you can change it. Do you disagree?
