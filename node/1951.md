body: Since so much of graphic design &amp; typography seems to be computer based
  these days, maybe we could have a small thread on the subject. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
  like to start off by saying that I have an older G4-400 with 3/4ths of a gig of
  RAM and a paltry 10-gig hard drive. Can I run Panther? Or should I stick with 9?

    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s the native resolution of the device. It&#39;s fine for most
    things, because most of the applications I use have scaleable menus, etc. The
    palettes in InDesign are a bit tiny because they don&#39;t scale, but it does
    mean that my actual work space is nice and big. Windows itself lets me set global
    preferences for icon and UI font sizes, and most apps use these. <BR> <BR>The
    only thing that really bugs me are website designers who specify type in fixed
    pixel sizes: a failure to understand the nature of the medium for which one is
    designing. CSS was specifically designed so that entire websites could made dynamically
    scaleable, but how many web designers do this? <BR> <BR>ClearType also helps things
    a lot, even the new tiny type in the Typophile forums.'

    got most of my CD collection stuffed onto it. I&#39;ve been very surprised how
    little I mind its big pixels, and realize how little pressure there must be -
    on hardware vendors to improve resolution, and on software makers to make scalable
    interfaces - when photos and video looks this good, and subpixel text works so
    well here at 100dpi. <BR> <BR>Somehow I managed to avoid upgrading my old computer
    &#40;Pentium II 400 MHz&#41; for too long, but fortunately something unmissable

    recommend it! It has a resolution of 1280x1024. With an adaptor you can connect
    it to a powerbook. You could get a G3 or G4 -- perfectly awesome machines -- off
    Ebay and a nice new Studio Display, and away you go! But if you get a G3 or firstgen
    G4, you&#39;ll need a $100 adaptor to use the diplay with it -- the ADC to DVI
    adaptor that is the same one used to connect to a laptop or to connect two monitors
