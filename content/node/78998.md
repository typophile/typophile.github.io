body: "I am creating a monospaced monoheight display font were the kerning distance
  and leading height are identical. The problem I am having, is that when I test the
  font in InDesign I do not have a simple default way of getting the font leading
  to be identical to the kerning. This is critical as some of the ligatures are vertically
  oriented and connect glyphs from two or more lines.\r\n\r\nThe Font Information
  is as follows:\r\n\r\nUPM size: 320\r\n\r\nAscender: 320 on most glyphs and 420
  on the vertically oriented ligatures\r\n\r\nDescender: 0  on most glyphs and -100
  on the vertically oriented ligatures\r\n\r\nLine gap: 20  (to match the 20 for kerning)\r\n\r\nSafe
  zone top: 420\r\n\r\nSafe zone bottom: -100\r\n\r\nCaps height: 320\r\n\r\nxheight:
  320\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help \r\n"

  body: "Besides whatever you do with your vertical metrics, InDesign's auto-leading
    is 20% of the point size. So with a 320-unit em square, that would be 64 units.\r\n\r\nYou
    might also see this thread: http://typophile.com/node/69582\r\n\r\nAlso, you use
    the word \"kerning\" where most of us would say \"sidebearings\" which are a rather
    different thing....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thank you for the suggestions oldnick and Thomas. \r\n\r\nReading the link
    I got the crazy idea to lower the baseline by 20 so that the leading might be
    identical to the sidebearings when set to solid set. I hope. Will have to try
    it on Monday. \r\n\r\nThe reason I do not set the UPM size to 1000 is that the
    math gets too complicated for me. The xheight and Caps height are the same because
    the font only has monoheight caps with no descenders other than the vertically
    oriented ligatures."
