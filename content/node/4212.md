  target="_blank">this</a> site? The lc_r isn&#39;t the same. Does anyone know if
  Latino! Rumba has an alternate lc_r? <BR> <BR>sorry for trying to hijack that other

  body: Lordy...my eyes are tired from looking through every source I can think of
    -- and I found a couple of close ones, but none that fit &#40;Rumba has a couple
    of other inconsistencies&#41;. Stewf has a secret list of casual latins -- I&#39;m
    sure he&#39;ll know.

  body: This is definitely not Rumba although it&#39;s got a similar look. Rumba is
    heavier and the baseline is less straight among other things. Ampersand is wrong.
    But this one looks familiar, I&#39;ll look around.

  body: They say the designer is &#39;Attention Earthling&#39; , a foundry that has
    stopped doing business. I don&#39;t know the designer&#39;s name, but it was designed
    in 1996.   The font is available from T-26 and MyFonts.com <BR> <BR>Anyone have
    any more info?

  body: Luc Devroye&#39;s site says the designer was &#39;Bonefish Sam&#39;. Further
    Googling reveals that this is the same Bonefish Sam as &#39;Bonefish Sam &amp;
    His Power Orchestra&#39; &#40;an Idaho band?&#41; who also does writing, graphics
    and web design for Bosch&#39;s Occasional Journal  <a href="http://www.boschs.org/stuh/authors.shtml"
    target="_blank">&#40;it says here&#41;</a>. It&#39;s a <i>very strange</i> journal,
    like something Beavis &amp; Butthead would have done, so this font-man is out
    there!The Journal is definitely &#39;occasional&#39; too, because the newest article
    is from 2002. <BR> <BR>There was apparently a famous fishing guide in the Bahamas
    with this nickname too, whose real name was Sam Taylor.  &#40;Ain&#39;t Google
    a marvel?&#41; <BR> <BR>I guess I really don&#39;t have enough to do. Sorry for
    the diversion.

    ... I respectfull disagree. The typeface used on the site is more finessed and
    unified. There are too many <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/sawdust-marionette/sawdust-marionette/testdrive.html?s=Pride%2B%26%2BPrejudice&amp;p=48"

  body: This one is driving me crazy, too. I just noticed this evening that the same
    exact font is used on the Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle Season 1 DVD Collection packaging.
    Out of curiosity, I managed to download and open one of the Flash SWF files on
    the Pride and Prejudice site. Of course, the font itself was not accessible, but
    there was a reference to it. It is listed as &#34;DesigersBold&#34; &#40;whatever
    that is&#41;. A search on the web yielded no font with that name. &#40;I also
    tried spelling it &#34;DesignersBold&#34;.&#41;

    I looked at the original and it together. It had enough similar features that
    I stopped looking, as we were getting ready to leave for the weekend. Another
    near miss is ITC Juice. Can you show us the two you mentioned Stuart? Here are
    my two &#40;below&#41;, with the original. You know if you used Fontographer and
    merged these two  it might be close... <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33202.gif"

  body: I must withdraw my earlier suggestions, neither is closer than House Rhumba
    which I think is the base weight of this font. <BR> <BR>Other than the alternate
    cap P and r, which may or may not be part of perhaps an OT version of this font,
    it looks really darn close to me. The glyph forms are just too close to it for
    this not to be Rhumba with some alts and might I add really bad tracking/kerning
    as it is set on the site.. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Latino Rumba. Check out the substantial differences
    between the &#34;M&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;t&#34;, and &#34;h&#34; in this additional
    sample I got off the Pride &amp; Prejudice site &#40;and House&#39;s neato LetterSetter&#41;.
    I searched all over the net and couldn&#39;t find what this font is though ...

    off the site and then &#34;read&#34; what font this is in acrobat, but i can&#39;t
    seem to get the poster to load or download so i can do this. &#40;and then maybe
    they flattened the image for the poster and all font info is gone i can&#39;t
    tell!&#41; <BR>btw, anyone see the movie? is it worth watching? <BR> <BR>aha!
    got it to work, but it looks like the font was photoshopped so there goes that
    idea... great way to find out what fonts newspapers are using tho.... LOL
