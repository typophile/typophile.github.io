    a font - could be hand painted signage.\r\nThat being said, it has some fun glyphs
    - love the G,S and L."

    body: 'Thank you so much for looking into it! I''m having no luck finding a matching
      font either. The very glyphs you mentioned are what attracted my attention to
      this particular signage. I guess there is enough here to actually attempt to
      create a font based on this lettering, although I do wish there was an R or
      B included somewhere in the mix. Anyways, if I do decide to take this on, I
      will post my progress here. Thanks again for taking the time to check into this. '
