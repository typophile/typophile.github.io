  body: This IS definitely wood type inspired. I come across that  <BR>stuff once
    in a while, and I really should keep track of  <BR>these encounters. <BR> <BR>Very
    widely used is Adobe&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rosewood/"
    target="_blank"> Rosewood Fill</a>, Cape-Arcona&#39;s  <BR><a href="http://www.cape-arcona.com/sites/fonts/font_strongman.html"
    target="_blank"> CA Strongman</a> is deliciously quirky, Psy/Ops has several  <BR>variations
    of <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_deadwood.html" target="_blank"> Deadwood</a>.
    No match for now. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    Test Pilot Collective</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.testpilotcollective.com/paypal/cam.html"
    target="_blank"> Cam</a>. A family of  <BR>8 typefaces designed by Mike Cina in
    1997. I remember  <BR>it struck me as seeming quite &#34;out of place&#34; in
    Test  <BR>Pilot&#39;s catalogue, which is more tech-oriented. It <i>is</i>  <BR>a
    beauty, and you&#39;re absolutely right about the R.

  body: Test Pilot Collective! Oh man, I&#39;m slipping. No wonder it didn&#39;t click
    right away, we&#39;re not currently carrying Mike Cina&#39;s TPC fonts at Veer.
    Nice spotting, Yves.

  body: Thanks a lot guys, yeah that R is really nice. It has some old-fashioned look
    with a modern twist.
