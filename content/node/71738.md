body: "Can someone please help me identify this font? It looks a lot like Aaux, but
  there are some slight but significant differences. The lowercase g has a different
  descender, and the logo font is a little more condensed. It also looks a little
  like Option Sans, but that's not quite right either.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Conduit and Informatic, while not being spot-on, would certainly provide
    good starting points for recreating the \u2018g\u2019. Maybe the letter has been
    drawn from scratch, although I doubt it. The \u2018r\u2019 perfectly overlays
    with the shapes of FF DIN. They rather changed the \u2018c\u2019, in which the
    counter appears to be slightly more closed, and the \u2018i\u2019, which has a
    lowered tittle."
