body: "Hi all, I expect find you fine in this new year. This is my first entrance
  of 2015, now releasing my latest type project CAMINITO, a layered font family inspired
  in Argentinean art craft \xABFileteado Porte\xF1o\xBB. I started this project 2
  years ago, taking inspiration from numerous ads, posters and signs installed along
  the city of Buenos Aires. Now the font family is available at MyFonts.com\r\n\r\nFileteado
  Porte\xF1o is a type of artistic drawing, with stylized lines and flowered, climbing
  plants, typically used in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is used to adorn all kind
  of beloved objects: signs, taxis, lorries and even the old colectivos, Buenos Aires\u2019s
  buses. Filetes (the lines in fileteado style) are usually full of colored ornaments
  and symmetries completed with poetic phrases, sayings and aphorisms, both humorous
  or roguish, emotional or philosophical. They have been part of the culture of the
  Porte\xF1os (inhabitants of Buenos Aires) since the beginnings of the 20th century.
  One of the most highlighted and recognized artists nowadays is Alfredo Genovese,
  who does a great job of teaching and claim this art and craft. The name Caminito
  reminds the emblematic and iconic Buenos Aires neighborhood immortalized by Carlos
  Gardel in music, in the tango.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/vargusjohn/caminito/]]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Congratulations. Fantastic! A layered font is a great idea, and you achieved
    it beautifully. I was thinking, though, why sell the layers separately since they
    are meant to be used together?
