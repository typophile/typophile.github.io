  I thought I saw one once, but might very well be remembering a book on printer's
  marks or union bugs.\r\n\r\nBriarPress.org used to have a section devoted to pinmarks
  which was great, but it's been down since their redesign (http://www.briarpress.org/15798).\r\n\r\nI'm
  also aware of the pinmark Flickr pool, but that still isn't very heavily populated."

    foundry that cast it. Nick, I have a single sheet somewhere in my files on the
    subject, but not a whole book. Let me know if you'd like to see it.\r\nJuliet"

  body: "Juliet, I'd appreciate any information you might be able to share. Thanks
    so much.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I've learned about a couple of small printed
    publications on the topic, both by someone named Georg Kandler. Unfortunately,
    both of them are written in German, so I'll have to do some translating before
    the text is of much help to me personally."
