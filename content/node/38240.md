  body: "I like the general Fontin `feel', and the subtle curves in the serif bases.&nbsp;
    I used Fontin Semi for my r\xE9sum\xE9 to good effect, and may well switch when
    this is released.\r\n\r\nThat said, the capital J feels like it's missing part
    of its tail (Semi & Serif have distinct tails), and the joints on the lowercase
    k & y feel `bumpy' even at small sizes.&nbsp; Also, most of the serif are symmetrical,
    even when most serif fonts introduce an asymmetry (<em>e.g.</em> to keep the P
    from `falling over' &c.).\r\n\r\n\u2014Joel"

  body: "Very well done!\r\n\r\nI agree about the J not complementing the other two
    fonts.\r\n\r\nSomething else I've noticed. K. It looks like the top arm is going
    too much to the right and looks like it's wider on the top thus making it a bit
    unstable. Or maybe it just need the middle join to be moved a little bit lower.
    A small bit.\r\n\r\nThe g looks more serif in Semi version than it looks in the
    Serif one. To me the Semi version is too serif and you should exchange these two
    letters from one to the other. Or do something about it.\r\n\r\nLc s also need
    some work on the end of the bottom stroke, because I think it goes too high and
    closing the shape more than it should."

    top arm extending that far right will create fit problems for Y, and possibly
    W, V.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    most characters mentioned. Let me know if it's better.\r\nIt's much more work
    then I thought it would be :)\r\n\r\nAlso did the numerals... and a few other
    things. \r\nSpacing and kerning still need to be done."

  body: "I really like this face. It feel very sensuous and curvy with a dark color,
    and makes me think of pinups by Vargas and Olivia.\r\n\r\nI think that the upper
    terminals on <strong>s</strong> and <strong>S</strong> are too heavy and seem
    to droop. It has something to do with thecloseness of the  the central stroke
    of the letter, which is why the hefty upper serif is not a problem in <strong>C</strong>.
    The crossbar on <strong>f</strong> breaking up and the left side could come down
    a little. It also seems like the terminal of the descender on <strong>y</strong>
    is lacking the sensuous nature of the rest of the letters and comes to an abrupt
    end. "

    ligature. I do think there\u2019s too much motion in the ligatures of <strong>ct</strong>
    and <strong>st</strong>; right now the connector appears to be crashing into the
    letters from the upper-right."

    otherwise your Fontin family is really really beautiful. I didn't download them

    encouraging!\r\n\r\nWorked mostly on the accents and made some very minor adjustments.
    I've uploaded a new pdf.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ct_6160.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n@
    James:\r\nWell, must say that I had other intentions (see image) with the ct ligature
    then making a crashing appeareance :-)\r\nIt looked very logical to me, but maybe
    I stared at it too long. I changed the 'connector' slightly.\r\n\r\n@ litera:\r\nI
    haven't made up my mind yet about 'g'. I could also use the shape I have now and
    make it a bit open.\r\n\r\nAbout \u010D\u010C\u0161\u0160\u017E\u017D: Fontin
    (Semi) none, Fontin Sans only \u0161\u0160\u017E\u017D. But I will update them
    when Fontin Serif is ready. All my new fonts (and also Fontin Serif) do have full
    CE support and Esperanto. With the use of 'Anchors an Carets' and 'Class kerning'
    it's not much extra work. \r\n"

  body: Awesome work. Fontin is just about the only free original design  I know of
    that's worth the bandwidth it takes to download and once the Serif subfamily is
    rolled out, I suspect you'll have an unstoppable juggernaut. If I had money, I'd
    donate to you, but since I don't I'll just feel woefully inadequate when I compare
    my own feeble start of a font (http://typophile.com/node/38792) to your genius
    efforts...

    soon. Completion will take a while. I'm also busy with Italic now and find it
    really difficult to 'serif' it.\r\n\r\n@ Michael/mjkerpan: There's a great resource
    [[http://typophile.com/node/14652|here]] on Typophile regarding free fonts. Lots
    of font there and absolutely worth downloading. Starting (and finishing) a font
    is a personal journey in which inspiration -not comparison- guides you. \r\nFor
    your information: I still feel inadequate."
