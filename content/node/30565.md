body: "I need some help. First some background: This logo is for an apartment building.
  My client renovated an old brick building with a crown on the top. They added two
  stories on top of this that look more modern. I used the contrast between the two
  as the idea for the logo. \r\n\r\nI think its working very well, but unfortunately
  I am having a disagreement with my client. They want me to include the two lines
  (see the gif) around the star. The lines came from an earlier version of the logo
  that included other details of the window. It worked better in that version, but
  is not working for me in this more simplified version.\r\n\r\nMy client wants to
  include the lines because they didn't think the other version looked enough like
  a window. I am trying to convince them we don't have to be so literal. It's not
  a window, its a logo that took some inspiration from a window. I think the lines
  are ugly, unnecessary, and distracting. How can I convince my client to lose them?
  Or do you disagree?\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NSaSF_6257.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NSbuilding_5719.jpg]"

    sometimes you have to go with what the client wants in the end. It may not always
    be the right thing but\r\nunfortunately that's the way the design field works
    at certain times. I agree though, the lines\r\nare not needed but the client may
    feel the logo seems empty at the top because of the free space around the star.
    I feel that the lines and the star draw my attention to the top and my main focus
    should really be in the shape and the N. Don't know if that helped but I tried."

  body: I saw a tombstone, too. The actual windows are proportionately taller, so
    that might help. Maybe have the frame of the window, with the window white or
    clear and where the top & bottom windows meet is the dividing line between the
    modern & the classic Ns. The arced lines don't bother me, but I do think they'll
    break up when printed small. Keep us posted.

    the bottom-right issue is more drastic (it's not just optically imbalanced, but
    actually shorter), the top issue is purely optical: all three legs of the bottom

  body: "Hi guys, I've been out of town for a couple of days. It's nice to see that
    there has been some continued discussion in my absence. I really appreciate all
    of your input.\r\n\r\nThe baseline issue that was first pointed out by kco was
    an error on my part. Not sure how it happened, but I have fixed it now.\r\n\r\nI
    have tried some of the ideas that have been posted and you can see some of the
    results for yourselves below.\r\n\r\nI tried arching the negative space between
    the top and bottom of the N and it's not working for me. It detracts from the
    original concept and I don't plan on pursuing this option any further.\r\n\r\n2B
    shows a taller version of the logo, while 2A maintains the original proportions
    for comparison. To me this does not appear to make it look any less like a tombstone,
    but I would like to hear some other opinions on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n> If it\u2019s
    not to be recognizable as a window, then why are there so many details on the
    shape. Or why is it there in general? Why is it not a square or some other shape?\r\n\r\nWhen
    I was considering what shapes I could use, I wanted the shape to reflect the architecture
    of the building. The windows were a fairly distinct feature of the building, and
    they have the added bonus of naturally framing the star at the top.\r\n\r\nI did
    consider using a square as well, but I wasn't sure how to integrate the star.
    3B shows the N in a square without the star. I think it works pretty well, but
    my client has been very insistent upon including the star and I don't think I
    could convince them against that. And I like that star anyway.\r\n\r\nIn earlier
    versions of the window shape, I did not include the flared top or the lip at the
    bottom. The lip at the bottom helps integrate the shape with the type and makes
    it feel more grounded. Both the lip and the flare at the top also serve to give
    it a little more of the character of the building. I am really just trying to
    take some visual cues from the building without being too literal about it.\r\n\r\n>
    The solution: give us a solution that satisfies both your client and yourself.
    This only means you need to pull this logo a notch up! Don\u2019t give up, it\u2019s
    looking good.\r\n\r\nGood advice, and thanks for the encouragement. Based on the
    feedback here, I'm thinking I may need the lines after all. I guess it may need
    to be recognizable as a window, just so it's not mistaken for a tombstone (good
    call aluminum).\r\n\r\nTomorrow I am going to try varying the line weight a bit
    so they taper out and see if it makes them any more palatable for me.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again guys, I'll keep you posted.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NSvar_5064.gif]"
