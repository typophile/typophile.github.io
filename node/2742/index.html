  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I posted this on another thread about sketches, I think this spot is a better fit. <BR> <BR>These are a few initial directions of an identity system for a truck decaling company in NJ. Pretty much they travel the NJ/NY/PA area putting gigantic decals on trucks like FedEx &#40;I worked for them and after staring at that logo for entire summer I no longer see the ingenuity of the &#34;hidden&#34; arrow&#41; and other big names. It&#39;s tedious work, blowtorches are involved, and it&#39;s blue collar. So that&#39;s the background.  <BR> <BR>I am of course interested in receiving feedback on my work. As most who post their work on these forums, I am very open to criticism. <BR> <BR>I only have two jpgs of pencil sketches.

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;d suggest going back to the rotated-helmet concept, but having the higher horn on the left.

		<div class="commentbody">I concur with Hrant regarding the angled view of the helmet, and more specifically with Shreyas&#39; direction of &#34;having the higher horn on the left&#34;, or rather the red horn in the white area &#40;whichever side it ends up being on&#41;. <BR> <BR>Have you explored any solutions &#34;outside of the box&#34;, but within the same direction as this concept? Maybe there&#39;s no red frame outlining the red area and the type, and red type is to the right of the mark. Perhaps try framing the graphic mark only, then positionig the type somewhere outside of the rectangle. Try creating a random red and white/negative space checker pattern &#40;not a square board&#41; and incorporating the elements &#40;graphic and type&#41; into a portion of that pattern. Just some ideas</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Drew. I&#39;d love to see you develop the peeling sticker logo idea a bit more. Could be really great, if you balance the strong/ bold design with just a little wit. Though, I suppose it could be seen as peeling <i>off</i>, rather than being applied. <BR> <BR>I also agree with Hrant. The angled helmet&#39;s much more interesting. Personally, I like the one set in the V maybe with some centered type. It&#39;s bold and simple but not boring. The strong V makes up for the less impactful shape. &#40;also taking a refined helmet into account&#41; <BR> <BR>Of course, this is posted after the weekend, so you&#39;ve probably moved on. Oh well, 2 cents in.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Daniel, <BR> <BR>Just put two and two together with your ID thread. I was thinking this was Schwabesque. <BR> <BR>A side note about viking helmets: <a href="http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/loth/l/u/luiro/vikinghelmet_01_copy.jpg.html">no horns</a> <BR>But you probably want to keep them for recognition since the myth is more recognized than the original. I think you can add some more details and still be simple enough. Perhaps some rivet highlights? Mabe the eye/nose mask? Maybe not? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also try non-horizontal type treatments. Circle, with VIKING between the horns and DECAL below? Maybe a simple U shape below the helm? <BR> <BR>Whoops, just got another idea. Second to the viking helmet in recognizability is the viking longship. I think that might make a more compelling image.  <BR> <BR>For inspiration: <BR><a href="http://www.celticcharms.com/viloshpe.html" target="_blank">http://www.celticcharms.com/viloshpe.html</a> <BR><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/nordic/mirror/longship/0298hale.html" target="_blank">http://www.lysator.liu.se/nordic/mirror/longship/0298hale.html</a> <BR><a href="http://www.woodenboat.com/" target="_blank">http://www.woodenboat.com/</a> <BR> <BR>Definitely less clich</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m just tooling around with the helmet. Some time soon I will tool around with the peeling V idea. Also, I want to try out a solid helmet, per Chris&#39;s suggestion. <BR> <BR>The Viking Ship is the logo for Viking Books. It&#39;s a good logo I think, I haven&#39;t seen it in a long time and I haven&#39;t searched for it online. <BR> <BR>My brother wants me to use the pos/neg idea with an actual viking dude, maybe with a sword or something. We&#39;ll see if that ever happens. As of now I need to  get some feedback from the client. Thanks for the recommendations. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24567.gif" alt="helmets"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the solid square with the type &#43; helmet, but I&#39;m not sure if you need the reversed square in there...it&#39;s almost too much. Maybe try one with just the white helmet? <BR> <BR>The peeling V is also actually quite nice, though it may seem more like it&#39;s &#39;falling off&#39; rather than &#39;being applied&#39;. Ie, it may look like a shoddy decal that&#39;s coming off. Still, I like it.</div>
