  Fericiano Cresci and one of the compass drawers of his day.\r\nI think that is Palatino,
  but I can't find any reading material that mentions this issue.\r\nCould anyone
  tell me exactly what happened between them and reference?\r\nI am researching for
  an acadmic essay, and I would like to add these information in my work.\r\n\r\nThank
  you."
