  envelope contenders is a solution of running the address along the bottom left edge
  of the envelope.\r\n\r\nseen here:\r\n\r\n[[http://s157.photobucket.com/albums/t77/EricTLarsen/graphics%20misc/?action=view&current=lmfaEnvelope.jpg]]\r\n\r\nSometime
  shortly after i showed it to my friend i thought i'd remembered hearing *somewhere*
  that the USPS doesn't like type on the bottom edge of an envelope because of the
  way they stamp/mark the envelopes.  I spent an hour last night slogging through
  the USPS Domestic Mail Manual and i haven't been able to decipher anything definitive.
  \ \r\n\r\nI hope that some of you with better printing experience than i could let
  me know if you've encountered this in the past or know the answer as to whether
  or not it's forbidden?  (help.)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any remarks."

  body: "The US Postal Service doesn't recommend type any lower than 2.75 inches from
    the bottom ofthe envelope because that's the OCR Read area. When I was working
    for a printing company several years ago, one of our customers insisted that--for
    aesthetic reasons-- she wanted her return address within that zone. When most
    of the letters (primarily invoices) she sent ended up being delivered right back
    to her, she relented.\r\n\r\nPlacing type across the bottom of the letter is like
    shooting yourself in the foot: the USPS reserves an area approximately 5\" wide
    and .625\" tall from the bottom left-hand edge of the envelope for barcoding.
    Anything that intrudes into that area is likely to be covered by a white sticker.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Evidently, you slogged right by this...\r\n\r\nhttp://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/102.htm\r\n"

    you will.\r\n\r\na. lower than \"2.75 inches from the bottom...\" Do you mean
    not below 2.75\" from the top of the envelope?  Specifically the window of 5\"
    wide by .625\" tall from the bottom corner?  I want to make sure i'm not misreading
    you.\r\n\r\nb. i checked the dmm.102 and a number of the sections that they point
    to from withing that section to elsewhere in the document.  particularly with
    regard to 102, i don't see anything about Return Address, but instead the window
    for addressing the Deliver To section.  If it's on that page, i'd like to know
    where it is that i'm screen blind.\r\n\r\nc. Do you know of any issues regarding
    running the Return info on the verso on the envelope flap?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for
    taking a moment to talk me down off the ledge.  :)"

    The distance odlnick stated sounds right from my weak recollection of mailing
    guidelines.  You can look around usps.gov to find details.

    not below 2.75\" from the top of the envelope?</em>\r\n\r\nNo, I mean from the
    BOTTOM of the envelope; e.g.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/usps_3550.png]\r\n<br>\r\nIf
    the return address falls within the OCR Read (red) area, chances are very good
    that your customer will end up sending themselves mail, as in the example I noted.\r\n\r\n<em>Specifically
    the window of 5\" wide by .625\" tall from the bottom corner?</em>\r\n\r\nSpecifically,
    from the BOTTOM RIGHT-HAND SIDE (the orange area). This area is reserved for USPS
    barcoding and, if you do not cede this territory to them, they WILL claim it by
    pasting a white sticker on the envelope and printing their barcode there; therefore,
    unless the return address is very short, don't put it there...period.\r\n\r\nFURTHERMORE,
    if the envelope is used for a mass mailing AND carries an endorsement--i.e, Address
    Service Requested, Change Service Requested, Forwarding Service Requested--the
    return address MUST be printed in the upper left-hand corner. (\xA74.2)"

  body: Just remember what the main  function of the envelop is, to get the item inside
    delivered to the proper address in a timely manner. If that does not happen, it
    does not matter how cool your envelope looks if the only person who sees it is
    the postal clerk who dumps it into the Undeliverable bin

    the regulations are rules, not preferences. However, depending on the customer
    (massive amounts of direct mail marketing carries some weight) and the variance
    (would not affect operations downstream), the bulk mail supervisor or the postmaster
    at the receiving post office CAN, at his or her discretion, waive certain regulations.
    For instance, if a mailing piece does not conform to allowed proportions but the
    variance is small, the piece may be accepted. On the other hand, if barcode geometry
    and/or placement do not conform (hence affecting its mailability down the line),
    either the piece will be rejected or the mailer will lose the automation discount
    which, although a matter of only a few cents per piece, can add up to some serious
    money if the mailing is large.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about what's permitted
    and what's not, every bulk mail acceptant center has a Mailpiece Design Analyst
    who can review your proposal and tell you whether or not it will fly."

    the bottom is like putting a handle inside a coffee cup. What price \"cute\"?\r\n\r\nEven
    if no mail was ever returned to the sender, why would anyone ever risk covering
    up the name of the sender?\r\n\r\nThe whole idea of addressing an envelope is
    to make it easy for the Post Office to deliver the piece, and in case the addressee's
    address is incorrect, or the addressee moved or died, to return it to the sender.
    Putting the address on the bottom is killing two birds with one stone: impeding
    the Post Office in doing it's job, and potentially obscuring the name of the sender,
    robbing the sender of visibility, and if the return address is really covered
    over, possibly having the piece treated as junk mail.\r\n\r\nWhile you're at it,
    use the full 9 digit zip+4 code.\r\n\r\nRe The Eye Chart Envelope: the Post Office
    charges more if the address is not parallel to the longest dimension of the envelope."
