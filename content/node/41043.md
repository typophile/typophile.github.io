    with a straight-off the factory floor Macbook Air. He\u2019s sipping his quad
    espresso, enjoying a slice of Banana loaf while Sarah McLachlan, or some other
    iTunes favorite plays unobtrusively over the PA. He decides to check out the extremely
    clever ad he\u2019s had placed on the online version of the Wall Street Times,
    so using a single gesture the WSJ page comes up. His smug expressions immediately
    turns to one of shock, the espresso goes flying landing on his shiny new toy.
    He whips out his iPhone and within minutes an army of Flash devs quickly start
    to fix the ad, fearing for their very lives.   "
