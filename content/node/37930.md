  body: Yes, it is Frauscher Boats. Ralf Herrmann's "Hooptie" font is really close
    but not quite. It's more related to "Raceway". I'm looking the match this cap
    F and lowercase r specifically.

  body: That's what I was afraid of, but I had hope becuase I saw photos of it used
    on the names of individual boats like the "St. Tropez". I thought they must have
    had a font.... Maybe it's a custom font....
