  using the Monotype version) is a good font to be used together with Computer Modern
  for math content. (Garamond is too "round", in my opinion, although I would prefer
  it - Garamond Stempel - for text without math content. Note: For texts that need
  a more personal style, I''d use other fonts, however.) What do you think about the
  choice?'

    is a good font to be used together with Computer Modern for math content.</cite>\r\n\r\n<em>Computer
    Modern</em> is a Didone, and as such does not sit very well on a line of type
    with any other face, even another Didone such as <em>Didot</em> or <em>Bulmer.</em>
    A Neoclassical face such as <em>Baskerville</em> may work better, and there are
    some enticing similarities between Computer Modern and <em>[[http://www.tiro.com/Plantagenet/plantagenet_index3.html|Plantagenet]].</em>
    The greatest difficulty you will have is matching the weight.\r\n\r\nIf <em>Garamond</em>
    does not work for you, how about pairing Computer Modern with a Garamond that
    is not a Garamond at all? Namely, a \u2018Garamond\u2019 that is based on the
    work of Jean Jannon, such as Monotype <em>\u2018Garamond\u2019</em> or Simonicini
    <em>\u2018Garamond\u2019?</em>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SimoniciniGaramond_ComputerModern_5803.png]\r\n\r\nFinally,
    have you considering using Hermann Zapf's <em>Euler</em>? That would allow you
    to select among Zapf's other designs, such as <em>Aldus</em> or <em>Palatino,</em>
    for a companion face.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zaph-Aldus-Euler_specimen_5220.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    glyph coverage of Euler might not be as large as Computer Modern, but it is an
    eminently more handsome face."

  body: "Thank you for your advice, Christopher! Your observation on Computer Modern
    not sitting well with any other font is quite to the point. If the CM parts would
    not be limited to single letters, this would be probably an unsolvable problem.
    \r\n\r\nSimoncini Garamond and Computer Modern looks like a reasonable combination,
    I'll check that out. (There might be problems with the relative weight of the
    fonts, difficult to say by just looking at the screen images.) \r\n\r\nGaramond
    Monotype is too \"lively\" (too much difference in stroke widths, I guess, but
    I'm not familiar with how to verbalize the technical details). Aldus and Palatino
    have the same problem. (If you have too write rather ugly prose, and math-related
    texts tend not to allow excessive creativity, a lively font contrasts too much
    with the dry nature of the content.) \r\n\r\nAs for the Euler math fonts, the
    glyph coverage (extensible math characters, specialized symbols) is not as comprehensive
    as for the Computer Modern, so it would be a risky choice. \r\n\r\nPlantagenet
    is a very interesting font, but much too heavy for Computer Modern, as far as
    I can see."

  body: "\"Ask yourself, do you really need bold?\" Titles of mathematical papers
    are often rather long, so the font size cannot be much larger than the text font
    size, so title are often set in bold letter. It's possible to use a different
    font for titles, of course. I don't know if I would use bold elsewhere (e.g. semibold
    for margin notes), but I haven't used it in the text itself for a long time. \r\n\r\nMelior
    looks promising. Zapf International's serifs probably don't fit well with CM,
    but the font is a very interesting combination of \"calm\" and \"lively\" elements.\r\n\r\nI
    have to do some other stuff at the moment, so I'll come back to this later. Thank
    you very much for your help! (Is there a section on Typophile for font combinations?
    I assume that these kind of questions come up rather regularly.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to be too "squared" (letters like o, b, q, for example).

    \r\nMost of the time, Computer Modern needs to be complemented with the amsmath

    Modern for math, rather than finding a suitable text font to match it.  The difference
    in weight between Computer Modern and almost anything else is just too jarring
    to me.  Of course, a beautiful mathematician once said to me, \"Oh, Computer Modern---it's
    so spindly.\"  After that, I could never go back.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I like looking
    at the Palatino/Euler pairing, especially for dry mathematics, but it is a bit
    informal-looking.  The Minion packages look very nice to me.\r\n\r\nst"
