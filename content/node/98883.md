  body: Thanks Ryku, your suggestions are close! This is from a wine list and I managed
    to ID the other font in the list (not shown) which was Trajan Pro. Still stuck
    on this, but I have been told it must be a mainstream font.

  body: DPape thank you so much! I have posted on other forums and font suggestions
    were not even close. Some suggested it was not a real font. You have given me
    the exact font!!!! It was not even a mainstream font, you are amazing!
