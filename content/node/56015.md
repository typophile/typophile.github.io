body: "Dear fellow Typophiles,\r\n\r\nMy idea is to create a logo that can be used
  on products and things that are made in Latvia (Northern Europe). Logo has to be
  easy to print/burn/sew on <strong>any type</strong> of product or thing.\r\n\r\n<strong>Here
  is what I have come up with -- [[http://madeinlatvia.org|madeinlatvia.org]]</strong>
  ([[http://madeinlatvia.org/draft.jpg|initial draft]]).\r\n\r\nThings worth knowing:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Latvia
  is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia|located]] near the Baltic Sea. It has lots
  of white sand beaches and [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/latvia/interesting/|wide
  open fields with blooming meadows]] and birch and pine tree forests that take up
  almost 50% of the territory.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Latvians have inhabited that territory
  since 900 AD, while the recent history made us live <em>under the flags</em> of
  various foreign superpowers of which the last one was the Soviet Union.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Here
  are some examples of the [[http://zagarins.net/Latvjuraksti/Kurzeme-Zemgale/index.html|traditional
  folk clothing]]. Most of the design patterns [[http://zagarins.net/Latvjuraksti/Krekluraksti/index.html|used
  in clothing]] and [[http://zagarins.net/Latvjuraksti/Z%27ogi_jumti_durvis/index.html|architecture]]
  were based in pagan beliefs.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>A lot of the [[http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=latvian+design&page=2|today's
  graphic design]] influence comes from the Soviet times.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nConcepts
  used in the logo:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>MADE IN</em> and the thick line below it
  forms a Latvian flag (two horizontal stripes divided by one white stripe -- 2:1:2).</li>\r\n<li>Typeface
  design influenced by [[http://www.laima.lv|Laima chocolate]] logo, [[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EHbf-gkQ3Hc/R6yeCQwPJBI/AAAAAAAACFk/97nolH2WujA/s1600-h/sakta.jpg|Sakta
  department store logo]] and [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/evansphoto/494970221/|the
  Sea]].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts on the typeface and
  the spectrum of emotions this logo creates. Thank you.\r\n"

  body: "> the spectrum of emotions this logo creates\r\n\r\nI like it a lot. It has
    a soft and approachable feel to it, it looks pleasant and coherent and it is unique
    enough for the purpose you described. Lex has a point regarding the color, but
    overall the logo is excellent as is."

  body: "Lex and epsilicon, thank you very much for the feedback.\r\n\r\nThe color
    of the flag is burgundy, indeed. The idea, however, is that the color accent of
    the logo can be adjusted to fit the products' color scheme. The particular green
    comes from [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/melnaapantera/2700888128/|this impression]]
    of the country.\r\n\r\nHere it is in burgundy:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/made-in-latvia-logo-flag_5266.png]"

  body: "Thank you for the suggestion, James. I'll do exactly as you suggested. Maybe
    it is a good idea to create an adjusted version for use at small sizes.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think of the typeface? Does v look like v or u?"

    confusing if you hadn\u2019t asked. I will admit that it\u2019s a little oddball,
    but only because this script\u2019s proportions are a little odd, and I find that
    rather charming. "

    a little bit flat to me."
