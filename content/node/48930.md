body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nYeah I am new here.....\r\n\r\nThought maybe some experts on
  here could help.... I ran up against a problem with one font I made on a Mac (using
  TypeTool btw).  First off the font is heavily manually kerned, since it is a cursive
  script where every glyph connects to every other letter.  There isn't really a way
  to connect the glyphs properly without a very large kerning list.\r\n\r\nNow when
  finished it, I see the font works like a dream on Mac.  It's working absolutely
  perfect.  \r\n\r\nNext I try to use it on PC.  BIG PROBLEM!  The font can be used
  in PC, but loses all its kerning so looks ugly.  I've tried putting it in different
  formats supported by TypeTool, different ways of zipping it, no luck.\r\n\r\nI've
  successfully made cursive fonts in the past.... these work fine on both platforms.
  \ The only difference I can think of with this one is the larger amount of kerning.
  \ Never have I run into this type of problem before.\r\n\r\nPlease help me, I am
  at a total loss of what to try next....  How can I get this font to work on a PC?\r\n\r\nI've
  thought of buying a conversion software, but don't know if that would help in this
  case.  Maybe I don't need it, since the font translates, its only the kerning that
  gets lost.  If I do need conversion software, any recommendations (preferrably free
  ones)?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "kerning is neither supported by wordpad nor by word with default settings.\r\n\r\nin
    word you can turn it on this way:\r\n   1. Select the text whose kerning you want
    to adjust.\r\n   2. Choose Font from the Format menu. Word displays the Font dialog
    box.\r\n   3. Display the Character Spacing tab. (Click here to see a related
    figure.)\r\n   4. Click on the Kerning for Fonts check box.\r\n   5. Adjust the
    character point size to indicate when Word should start adjusting kerning."

  body: "but kerning (if present) normally displays when you open the font to install
    on PC, right? i think the kerning just is not present on pc, regardless of which
    program i use...  i'll try some others too to find out.\r\n\r\ni'll try what you
    mentioned first though, changing the word settings like that, and post here the
    result. thanks for the advice, hope it works.... :)"

  body: "no, the default font preview of windows does not display kerning, so if you
    \"open\" (doubleclick) the font file, it potentially looks ugly.\r\n\r\nYou should
    check the font with a program like indesign, illustrator, photoshop, xpress. If
    the kerning is okay there, the font is okay."

  body: This is why it so many people say it's a good idea ( if possible ) to design
    your fonts so they work as well as possible prior to kerning. Of course if you
    don't care about word or apps that don't have kerning you can do as you like...
    But it's worth considering carefully. The other aspect of this is that doing that
    may not be easy. It might also compromise the voice of your font. So as usual
    - it depends...

    discussion about using or not using the extension lookup type makes me feel quite
    uncomfortable. Effectively you describe the type designer as someone who produces
    plugins for this or that application and its limitations (e.g. Word).\r\nAs a
    designer I would say that design should decide which technology is required to
    implement it, i.e. whether kerning is needed, even if so much kerning is needed
    that it can be dealt with only by employing newer aspects of OT specs. Not the
    other way round.\r\nIt is nice if a particular typeface can get away with little
    or no kerning, but no or little kerning should not be a goal in itself. It is
    not a design virtue.\r\n\r\nRather, we should encourage OS and application developers
    to access <em>all</em> the data present in a font, all of which are documented
    in specs. And with 'we' I not only mean type designers but also users of fonts
    who -- I think -- would like to use every bit of what they paid for, rather than
    a few pieces to which OS and application developers give access.\r\n\r\nKarsten\r\n"

  body: There is two types of kerning. TTF kerning and OT kerning which has a 'kern'
    feature in OT tables. I suspect that you put TTF kerning in your font which is
    only supported on Mac platform. On Windows, I suspect kerning is only supported
    as OT 'kern' feature.

    could take a stubborn, alternative approach and guarantee the font would be unusable

    fonts contain in a table-o-'recommendations' indication of what tables and subsets
    of tables can and cannot be done without, in a given environment and use. \r\n\r\nExamples
    of this: Ed Interlock works fine without OT, but why bother? Courier can go to
    the ends of the earth without kerning, but we suggest you not justify it. Augsburger
    initials is 'appropriate' for all uses, (;)), just please don't make it blink.
    \r\n\r\nSo, while encouraging OS and application developers to access 'all the
    data present in a font', that's only 1/3 of the problem, IMHO.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: Or just support what's defined in the specs? For example, I never understood
    the "optional" approach to OT layout tables ... If I add these tables, then not
    because yesterday was rain and I had nothing better to do.

  body: I suspect there is more to it. In my experience that I had to constantly do
    matchmaking between AAT and OT, a TTF specs kerning (supported in AAT) is always
    directly between two consecutive glyphs. I'm not sure if we can make a parallel
    between vowels in Arabic script and say, circumflex accent on an e but I know
    that if a vowel is in between two kerned glyphs, the kern is lost. In 'kern' feature
    of OT you have the lookup with the 'ignore' option.
