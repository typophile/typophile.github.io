  body: Thanks Adam very good links. A lot of to read <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Seems to me is more complicated than ever thought. <BR>I
    am writing disseration about Adrian Frutiger and his typecases. I would like to
    test Univers on scren - how it looks like on low resolution. Could you tell some
    tips what is the best way to do it? I&#39;ve just try it in Fireworks. Homestly
    I&#39;m not sure if its the way. Anyway thank you a lot. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'Vojtech,  <BR> <BR>As Simon writes, there are different digital versions
    of Univers: official designs and their clones. Some of them are still available
    for sale, some are not. Below is a short list of those I know of. I agree with
    Simon that the Linotype &#34;XSF&#34; version is probably the one with the best
    screen quality.  <BR> <BR> <BR>1. Font: LTUnivers &#40;LinotypeUnivers-BasicMedium&#41;

    &#40;c&#41; 1994 by Scangraphic <BR> <BR> <BR>This list is by no means extensive
    and I&#39;m sure I omit something.  <BR> <BR>I recommend testing on following
    operating systems:  <BR> <BR>[OSX] Mac OS X 10.3.7 <BR> <BR>[OS9] Mac OS 9.2 or
    Mac OS X Classic mode, with ATM 4.6 Lite installed <BR> <BR>[W98] Microsoft Windows
    98 SE with ATM 4.1 Lite installed <BR> <BR>[WXP] Microsoft Windows XP SP-2 <BR>
    <BR>&#40;If you&#39;re only working on a Mac, I recommend that you get Virtual
    PC and install two virtual machines, one running Windows 98 and the other Windows
    XP -- this way you will have the ability to test on all platforms on just one
    computer&#41;.  <BR> <BR>You can go to <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/</a>
    and download the demo versions of FontLab 4.6 for Mac and FontLab 4.6 for Windows.
    In FontLab, you can activate the &#34;Type 1 hinting tool&#34; to preview Type
    1 fonts and the &#34;TrueType hinting tool&#34; to preview TrueType fonts.  <BR>
    <BR>Using FontLab 4.6 on Windows 98, you can preview the Type 1 and OpenType PS
    fonts using the Adobe ATM 4.1 rasterizer in 2 modes &#40;black-and-white and grayscale&#41;,
    and TrueType fonts using the Microsoft Windows 98 TrueType rasterizer in 2 modes
    &#40;black-and-white and in 5 shades of gray&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Using FontLab 4.6
    on Windows XP, you can preview the Type 1 and OpenType PS fonts using the Adobe
    Windows rasterizer in 2 modes &#40;black-and-white and grayscale&#41;, and TrueType
    fonts using the Microsoft Windows XP TrueType rasterizer in 3 modes &#40;black-and-white,
    in 21 shades of gray and in Windows XP ClearType&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Using FontLab
    4.6 on Mac OS X, you can preview the Type 1 and OpenType PS fonts using the Apple
    ATSUI rasterizer in 2 modes &#40;black-and-white and grayscale&#41;, and TrueType
    fonts using the Apple Mac OS X rasterizer in 2 modes &#40;black-and-white and
    in grayscale&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Using FontLab 4.6 on Mac OS 9 or in Classic mode
    &#40;you can switch the start mode of FontLab in Get Info&#41;, you can preview
    the Type 1 and OpenType PS fonts using the Adobe ATM 4.6 rasterizer in 2 modes
    &#40;black-and-white and grayscale&#41;, and TrueType fonts using the Apple Classic
    rasterizer in 2 modes &#40;black-and-white and in grayscale&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Alternatively,
    you can also use VTT as Simon recommended to preview the TrueType fonts. <BR>
    <BR>You should also consider testing the fonts in at least two Adobe applications:
    InDesign CS on Windows and Photoshop 6 on Mac, for representative results. I believe
    you can get free trial versions of the Adobe applications from the Adobe website.  <BR>
    <BR>So altogether, you have 4 different environments to test, with a total of
    approx. 10 modes for each format.  <BR> <BR>If you choose 10 different digital
    versions of Univers and test it in 10 different rendering modes, you would have
    a very nice sample of 100 different screen renderings of Univers. I&#39;m sure
    people on this forum would be interested to see such a comparison <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Thank you a lot. Originaly I wanted to write just a litte bit about hinting
    - I didn&#39;t know anything about it at all. But now I realise it&#39;s could
    be copletly new topic of  dissertation or even new section in library <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>When I will finish my dissertation I am sure
    I will make some deep research about hinting...it&#39;s really iteresting topic.
    I really appreciate your advices. Thx Adam &amp; Simon.
