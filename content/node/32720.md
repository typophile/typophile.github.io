body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m designing a book jacket on Nazi WWII propaganda and
  would like to use type that accurately represents the period. Does anyone have any
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m particularly confused about whether or not to use a
  blackletter typeface. I\u2019ve found a lot of information explaining that Nazi\u2019s
  rejected blackletter typefaces in the early 1940\u2019s. However, most propaganda
  pieces I\u2019ve found online use some variation of blackletter.\r\n\r\nMy other
  idea was to use Frutiger because that is the typeface of the current Bundeswehr
  (http://users.ncrvnet.nl/mstol/bundeswehr.html).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your
  help! \r\n"

    and does not follow the traditions of any former German military organisation,
    especially the Wehrmacht. So I think the Frutiger relating the Bundeswehr isn't
    the correct typeface for you."

    and other northern languages since Gutenberg. If it hadn\u2019t been for the Nazis
    misusing these faces for their sinister purposes, we would still be reading Fraktur.
    It is the typeface of Goethe, Martin Luther, Karl Marx and Hegel. And it is perfectly
    suited to set our long words and interminable sentences, still evoking Gothic
    cathedrals and narrow streets with timbered houses. The one used is called Wittenberg
    Fraktur, after the town where Luther nailed his theses on a church door in 1517.\"\r\nErik

    title, but it was a very classy job, and one article in particular struck me,
    about the autobahn. The photos were gorgeous, but they looked like stage sets,
    as there were no cars in them. The typography combined Futura Light all cap settings
    with blackletter in a modern, though symmetrical, layout.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think
    you will find a typographic monoculture on either side of the fence -- witness
    the communist John Heartfield's use of both blackletter and roman.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fingers_6119.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shortage_4638.jpg]\r\n\r\nWith
    regards to the demise of the blackletter, Naziism played little role in it --
    many northern European countries such as Poland, Denmark and Norway used it in
    the 19th century, and moved to roman before Germany did -- it had long been on
    the way out.\r\n\r\nThe great philologist Jakob Grimm published his work in roman
    type, and Goethe wasn't too keen on it either, so there was a long-standing tradition
    of German progressives moving away from blackletter.\r\n\r\n"
