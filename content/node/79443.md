  in History.\r\n \r\nIn an exhibition at the municipality of Bordeaux (France) on
  the IIWW and the Spanish inmates in German Lagers, I have seen this document: \r\n\r\n
  http://www.composicionapilable.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/buchenwald.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  wonder if you can help me to identify the typography.... It looks like a Bauer Beton
  or an ITC Lubalin Graph, but.... the date is 1942-1944.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much
  for the contributions of all of you"

    shown on myfonts.com.\r\nThe \"2.-\" looks like Berthold Block.\r\n\"65574\" \u2013
    is this the so called \"Normalschrift\"? Is there a digitization?"

  body: "Thank you ...very ...very  much to \"seb\" and \"poms\" for sharing your
    knowledge. The photography was shooted in the \"Centre Jean Moulin\"; the document
    was in a showcase, in a temporary exhibition. The document belonged to an Spanish
    inmate.\r\n\r\nI am not any specialist in typography (...nor in English too, as
    you can see), but I was surprised how much the font seemed to myself to be \"modern\",
    or even \"avantgarde\" in aesthetics terms, but in a context as indescribable
    as that one.\r\n\r\nVery kind of you. ... Thank you very much again "

    stamp of the Buchwald concentration camp canteen for the SS-staff worth 2 Reichsmark.
    \r\n\r\nBuchenwald, near of Weimar/Germany, was one of concentration camps during
    the nazi era, where the SS murdered and forwarded opposition members, jewish people,
    homosexuals etc.\r\n\r\nI link to a chart where you can read about the numbers
    of killed persons respectively the numbers of people, who were forwarded in the
    eastern extermination camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, Treblinka etc.\r\nhttp://totenbuch.buchenwald.de/information/index/reset/true\r\n\r\nApart
    from the typefaces and the design that should be perceived. That makes that  seemingly
    harmless food stamp really vicious. \r\n\r\nT."
