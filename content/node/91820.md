  I'd like to know which foundry/punchcutter was the first to produce it and when.
  The earliest book typeset with this font that I've got dates back to 1880's, I suspect
  it was produced at a much earlier date, perhaps at the beginnings of the 19th century.
  Thanks for your input.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hay2_5437.png]"

    it's old and stale (and features some confusable structures) it does embody enough
    cultural authenticity that I used it as one of the bases for my Nour:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf\r\n\r\nBTW,
    there's going to be a typographic conference in Yerevan from June 14 to 16. See

  body: "Thanks for your reply dear Hrant. (Sadly, I will not be able to make it to
    the conference.) I like Nour \u2014 correct me if I'm wrong; I've noticed that
    Vem(FF Ernestine) too bears resemblance to the early Bolorgir(\u0532\u0578\u056C\u0578\u0580\u0563\u056B\u0580)
    and Notrgir(\u0546\u0578\u057F\u0580\u0563\u056B\u0580) popularized by the Mechitarist
    as you've mentioned in your post. I used Vem for a project and the client finds
    it more legible than let's say Sylfaen. What are your thoughts on this?"

  body: "It's interesting that you see some Bolorgir in Vem - I hadn't thought of
    it that way. The slant, arch shapes and semi-serifs (which sort of all go together)
    probably cause that appearance, reflecting what I think makes for authentic Armenian
    type. In contrast, Sylfaen-Armenian has too many serifs (just like my Patria's
    Armenian subordinate style, shown in that PDF) although it <em>does</em> enjoy
    the benefit of \"stroke\" contrast. Sylfaen's Armenian is also too tight however.
    All that said, Vem actually derives much of its competence from Nina's original
    Latin design.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
