  body: "This seems to be a pre-digital film typeface. I found an exact match in the
    1971 Photo-Lettering catalog called \"Alexey Brodovitch Albro\" grouped in with
    styles they called \"Twenties\" (presumably for 1920's looks).\r\n\r\nI do not
    know of a digital version of this typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
