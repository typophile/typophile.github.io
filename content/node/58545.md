body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI am new here and also new to fonts creating,\r\nI just registered
  because I want to create a (smart) font but I'm not sure how to do it.\r\n\r\nThe
  font will be only UPPERCASE characters, that I will create in Illustrator and then
  paste in Fontlab, and I want to create multiple character instances/glyphs for every
  letter, and basically rename them A, A1, A2, A3, ... X, X1, X2, X3, and so on. The
  differences between these Xs for examples would be that:\r\nX is the regular X\r\nX1
  is the regular X with a _ (line) added on the bottom left corner ( _X )\r\nX2 is
  the regular X with that line on the top left corner\r\nX3 is the X with both lines
  on the left.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these characters is that when I type LX, the
  font to automatically replace the X with X1 in this case, so the L is joined with
  X due to that bottom line;\r\nAlso if after that TX (TX2 actually) I type another
  X, the font to change this new X with X3 in order to be linked to the previous X
  (X2 actually) perfectly by two lines now (X3 has one line on top left and another
  line on bottom left corner).\r\n\r\nBasically I think this needs to be something
  like the fi substitution but I've never done this before, and not sure how I can
  set up my glyphs and create the syntax to change only the i from f i instead of
  replacing the whole f i with a new fi glyph.\r\n\r\nI hope I was clear enough, any
  help/suggestion is greatly appreciated, Thank you."

  body: "Hello, and thank you for reply,\r\nSince I started this thread, I kept reading
    the forum, and I think I will need to use the 'calt' feature or the 'dlig' feature
    for discretionary ligatures, but I am NOT sure, and don't know how; I want to
    create all the characters in Illustrator (A-Z, and for all of them the rest of
    instances a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 and so on), put them in fontlab and create some kind
    of algorythm that automatically replaces when I type ABCDE with A B1 C2 D2 E2
    (following the example from my first post). But I don't know how to import/name
    all these a1 a2 ..-> z3 in fontlab and how to create/write the calt or dlig syntax(?)
    in the opentype dialog box.\r\nI will also search for alternates within a font,
    thank you."

  body: "thank you for the link, this may solve my problem, but here is another question
    then:\r\nwill the code work this way:\r\n\r\nsub f x by f x1;\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\nwhere
    f is normal F , X normal X, and X1 is _X (another glyph with the same X just with
    a line added on the left bottom part: _X)\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\nthank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
