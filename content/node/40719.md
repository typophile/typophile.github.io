  calendars to this art director/designer next year:\r\n\r\n1. It's overdesigned.\r\n2.
  It doesn't work\r\n3. I get lots of this stuff.\r\n4. I use the Entourage calendar.\r\n5.
  It's going straight to recycling. \r\n6. I do actually have a printed calendar in
  the kitchen--from my insurance agent. Nice scenic photos at top, basic boxed grid
  below. Not much of a \"design\", but the best design for the job."

    as a holiday gift? Assholes.

    Making sense of environmental options for your business\" from Flash Reproductions.\r\nI
    get this as a member of the RGD.\r\nIt's a free-standing \"tent card\" item of
    52+ sheets, wire bound.\r\nAs I don't use desktop calendars, and it's going straight
    to recycling, the green theme is somewhat ironic.\r\nAdded to which, damn thing
    is set entirely in Helvetica. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "At year end, you're supposed to tear off the calendar parts, and the remainder
    is a \"handy reference guide\".\r\nI could probably have used that as a reference
    book, if it had been designed in book format with a contents page and index.\r\nWhat
    use is a 52-page reference book with no index? That is really bad, stupid design."
