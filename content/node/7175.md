body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I started using ClearType on my WinXP Machine to the beginning
  of this week. <BR> <BR>So now I&#39;m really torn up, because the lack of readability
  &#40;legibility?&#41; this fuzzy thing causes, is definitely compensated by the
  new variety of forms I recognize on my Monitor. <BR> <BR>The first time you can
  really spot significant differences between typefaces, without having to do some
  workaround using InDesign. <BR> <BR>I think this topic would have been worth a discussion
  - at least I couldn&#39;t observe any while digging through the typophile archives.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure some of you might have a statement on this. Or is it such
  a No-Go, which it isn&#39;t worth debating about? <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik

  body: 'I don&#39;t think this thread really belongs in the Build section, which
    perhaos is why no one has responded to it. It doesn&#39;t, so far, touch upon
    the implications of ClearType rendering for <i>making</i> fonts. <BR> <BR>There
    is a &#39;sweet spot&#39; for ClearType rendering which is somewhere around 130dpi.
    At this resolution, the pixels are small enough for the visible artifacts of the
    subpixel colour filtering to largely disappear. Below that resolution, e.g. at
    the old Windows norm of 96dpi the physical pixels are too large for the technology
    to produce optimal results: the text will still look more faithful to the individual
    type design, but the fuzz is likely to be noticeable. I used a Toshiba laptop
    with a native resolution of 133dpi for the past couple of years, and ClearType
    works very well on this machine. I recently switched to a Dell with a resolution
    of 146dpi and, of course, ClearType looks even better. I&#39;ve also seen it in
    use at 200dpi, and this is really splendid: actually better than quite a lot of
    what passes for printing these days. <BR> <BR>Note, also, that you can tune the
    ClearType rendering system on your computer to get the best results for a&#41;
    your monitor&#39;s native gamma and b&#41; your personal colour sensitivity. See
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/1.htm" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/1.htm</a>
    for more information. Note that you need to be using Internet Explorer to perform
    this action.'

  body: Dominik, ClearType is really designed as a technology for LCD screens. It
    works by effectively increasing the x-direction resolution by addressing the individual
    RGB sub-pixels in an LCD pixel. On a CRT screen, the pixels are not composed of
    discreet sub-pixels; rather, the colour value of the whole pixel is adjusted to
    display different colours. <BR> <BR>Interestingly, and for reasons that are not
    completely understood, many people do find a slight improvement in font rendering
    using ClearType on a CRT screen, as compared to traditional greyscale antialiasing.
    The effect is quite minor, and the best guess as to why it seems an improvement
    is that ClearType is leaking small amounts of colour into adjacent CRT pixels,
    and this makes curves smoother than with traditional antialiasing. Because CRT
    is not the target technology for ClearType, little study has been made of its
    affect on CRT screens.

    hoaky to me is the use of italics type to exhibit the advantages of CT. We rarely
    read italics type continuously.</i> <BR> <BR>Using italics is useful to show immediate
    and obvious benefit of ClearType to the rendering of traditionally difficult diagonal
    strokes. It is pretty obvious that ClearType makes italics more readable, because
    it maintains the structure of the letters, which is broken in the stepped b/w
    bitmap, and the notan, which lost in greyscale. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52666.gif"
    alt="B/W&#44; greyscale&#44; ClearType"> <BR>So that is a basic improvement in
    both the aesthetic and functional aspects of one particular kind of type on screen,
    and it is an obvious improvement easily relatable to the increased x-direction
    resolution, which has made it useful in showing how ClearType works. <BR> <BR>Personally,
    I tend not to use italics in my comparisons, because I already <i>know</i> that
    italics are going to look better and be more readable under ClearType. What is
    of interest to me is tracking how improvements in the ClearType renderer, increases
    in screen resolution and, in the case of the CT Font Collection, sensitive design,
    result in experiential gains in on-screen reading.'

  body: 'This looks good, Hrant. But you have made it a bit easier for yourself by

  body: 'What&#39;s interesting is that you can do a tradeoff between the &#34;integerness&#34;
    of weight, and crispness. In an italics, since you have to give up very crisp
    forms anyway, you actually acquire the ability to deviate from integer weight
    wihout any [additional] penalty. So I can make my italics slightly lighter or
    darker pretty easily. However, you&#39;re right to imply that a proper relationship
    with the roman has to be maintained, and making the italics too light would be
    bad &#40;especially since my angle&#42; is already strong&#41;. <BR> <BR>Some
    related stuff: <BR>- I like to have stroke contrast; and -as I implied above-
    a 2-pixel stem font isn&#39;t necessarily too dark since it can have 1-pixel horizontals;
    <BR>- I could make the Roman lighter too &#40;if also less crisp&#41;; <BR>- Using
    a lighter weight for emphasis in running text isn&#39;t so bad - not as bad as
    the other way around. <BR>- Crispness can actually be a differentiation technique.
    It&#39;s possible that the best companion to a grayscale Roman is a b&amp;w italic,
    or... shudder... a b&amp;w upright cursive! <BR> <BR>&#42; The angle is actually
    dictated by the medium to a fair degree, btw. <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s the issue
    of what weight looks good - and that depends on effective resolution greatly.
    I think the color in your &#34;best&#34; &#40;3rd row&#41; italic is very good.
    But maybe a 2-pixel stem weight with looser spacing would be comparable? Anyway,
    ideal color needs to be worked into the equation with everything else, like chromatism,
    crispness, etc. <BR> <BR>&#62; there is no grey <BR> <BR>True, but you could say

    <BR> <BR>Optimum italic angle certainly is. ClearType allows for a greater range
    of angles to be handled better than full pixels, simply because of the increase
    resolution. In Constantia, I wanted the optimum anngle, so I have a run of 1:3.
    The other CT Font Collection families have a variety of italic angles. <BR> <BR><i>you
