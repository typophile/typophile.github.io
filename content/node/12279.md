body: "Hello,\r\nAs part of a project I've been asked to set a series of essays; two
  of these are on Modernism. However, each essay has to be set in a different face
  that echoes (or re-inforces) the topic it is speaking on. I wonder if anyone would
  be able to make any suggestions, as I'm having quite a difficult time selecting
  suitable faces!\r\n\r\n<em>Long Live Modernism!</em> by Massimo Vignelli \r\ncurrently
  set in Gill Sans, which is an issue - Italian-American author set in an English
  face, not too great a choice on my behalf. This is the one I'm having major issues
  setting.\r\n\r\n<em>The New World View</em> by Jan Tschichold taken from <em>The
  New Typography</em> \r\ncurrently set in Univers. I'm pretty settled on the setting
  for this one, as I feel Univers reflects the content and authorship of the essay.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions / critiques of my choices would be very helpful."

  body: "thanks for the replies.\r\n\r\nI initially set the Tschichold essay in Sabon,
    but then discovered on further reading that 'A New World View' was taken from
    <em>The New Typography</em> where he argues against serifs and for asymmetrical
    typography (including sans serif faces). Sabon was designed after he decided the
    views expressed in <em>The New Typography</em> were a little too radical and that
    serifs weren't so bad after all. (All the Penguin books are set in a serif, as
    per his detailed instructions).\r\nSo not sure whether that reflects the content
    as strongly. I guess ideally it would be set in the same face as <em>The New Typography</em>
    but I don't have it to hand to check what it's set in! It would be quite ironic
    to find it set in a serif...\r\n\r\nWill try helvetica and futura for the Vignelli
    - at the moment I'm thinking about Hevetica Neue as Vignelli is arguing for a
    revival/continuation of Modernist thought and a re-worked version of a Modernist
    face would be quite apt for this. Although so would Futura...I didn't realise
    this would be so tricky...! Thanks again."

      good to see you have been doing your research too.... Hope its coming along
      well. I have to say I have gone along with the choice of Caslon for Tschichold
      and Memphis for Vignelli. Im just enjoying setting the type now. Good luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nshare

  body: oh. right! well then you *must* use a sans for the tschichold. as for vignelli,
    i'll reiterate that helvetica is the right choice. if you look at his work he
    habitually/predictably/happily used helvetica and bodoni.

    and makes the page come to life with his use of space, alignment, and tension.
    \ The typeface does not do the work, Massimo does.  To that end, Helvetica is
    a good choice (though I much prefer Univers). \r\nMassimo's work would still be
    the same had he replaced Helvetica with either Univers or AG. I don't mean to
    say that it would have been better.  I am just trying to say that he chose a small
    set of tools and used them to their fullest.  That was just his way of working.
    \ I would much rather have a Vignelli piece (all done in Helvetica) hanging on
    my wall than any lesser designers work with all of my favorite type faces used.\r\nMassimo
    is a Helluva' master (and he mastered Helvetica to boot).\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    not because he had a full range of tools. Let's say that we give someone of mediocre
    skill and talent (call him \"Bob\") a complete set of the finest power building
    tools our modern era can produce and have him build a house.  Would you rather
    have the house that Bob built or the house that Jack built?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: I'm with Chris on this one. The typeface is only part of the solution in Massimo
    Vignelli's work. Of course, Helvetica, out of the can, isn't such a beautiful
    typeface. But, Massimo Vignelli takes it to that level with how he uses it. I'd
    be interested to see him revisit his work with other faces to see if they still
    had the same feel. You are most likely, maybe, right, Chris. But, for me Massimo
    Vignelli is Bodoni and Helvetica.

    Pyramids, the Parthenon, the Trajan Column, and the Stradivarius Violin were all

    latter years of his life, was crippled to the point that he could only barely
    use crude scissors yet managed great works of art using his inadequate tools and
    less adequate hands. With all the computer driven knowledge and high-tech laser
    tools available today, there has never been a violin created to rival the 17th
    Century Italian masters.\r\n\r\nI much prefer greater-than-adequate skill and

    His pyramids are made of talent.\r\nYou choose to attribute much more to tools
    than I feel tools merit. I prefer to attribute the majority of any success to
    the skill and talent of the human doing the work.  A resourceful person can make
    do with whatever tools he chooses. A person of mediocre skills can't do Jack with
    the best tools ever invented.  There has never been a violin to rival Stradivari's.
    Modern man has far better tools than Stradivari ever had but not the talent to
