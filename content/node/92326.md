body: "I have a case of 72 pt lead display gothic type and a blank wall in my house,
  so I tought of printing the beginning of El Quijote in Spanglish over a big sheet
  of paper. I think it will be somehow humorous and appropriate to print this text
  in a gothic face.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4490593762_329db19d49_z_5969.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere\xB4s
  the text: \"In un placete de La Mancha of which nombre no quiero remembrearme, viv\xEDa,
  not so long ago, uno de esos gentlemen who always tienen una lanza in the rack,
  una buckler antigua, a skinny caballo y un grayhound para el chase.\"\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone done something similar before? How? Which ink? Which paper? What about Fabriano?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    to print it directly on the wall. '

  body: Maybe, but I was thinking about something like a frame where I could press
    the paper and even make some extra copies for friends.

  body: Somehow I couldn't see my lass going for that, she'd go mental if I "fontified"
    a wall - love the idea though. Arts shop will easily provide a frame I would have
    thought. What colours / inks are you intending to use?

  body: "I'd suggest setting the type on a flat surface, clamp or wedge is in place,
    ink it... (and this is actually very clever :o) . I did it with lino cuts once
    upon a time using the ink from some ball point-pen refills. It looks like the
    surface area you're covering will render that option impractical, but oil paint
    would probably work as well (or, what the heck, get your self some printing ink
    from an art supply store) . Spread \r\nit on a piece of glass and use it to ink
    the type with a hard rubber roller. \r\n\r\nThen, lay the paper onto the type
    - keep it from moving and firmly press the paper onto the type with a clean rubber
    roller.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Oil paint and a brayer will work for inking if you set it up and tie it all
    together. Then put your paper on top and use a wooden spoon for pressure to print
    it. Stamp pad print would be a one off but you could then have copies made of
    that.

    instance, you would need 20 e's.

    assured.\r\n\r\nI may actually do it that way Rusell. It doesn't seem that difficult.
    If I can't get proper letterpress ink I will try Oil paint. \r\n\r\nJoshua I may
    have to think of a simple device for proper alignment because you made me realize
    I will have to do this job in three different stages."

    to clean the type, you would use \"type wash\" which is often \"denatured alcohol\"
    (buy it at any hardware store)."

  body: "Don\u2019t substitute oil paint. If you don\u2019t want to (or can\u2019t)
    get the quantity of letterpress ink, then you could use oil-based blockprinting
    ink instead. You should be able to find it in any reasonably well-stocked art
    supply store.\r\n\r\nFor paper, consider Rives BFK or Rives Lightweight. \r\n\r\nYou
    might consider dampening the paper slightly first. If you\u2019re not familiar
    with the technique, search for general instructions for wood block or relief printing."
