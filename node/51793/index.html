  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">greetings all!
I post here with hopes of any and all feedback, critiques, suggestions, etc. regarding the visual identity for my one-woman company, Lamoore Designs (Based in NOVA Scotia, canada.)
i'm a full-time artist and product designer/maker.
i am *not* a graphic designer, but have hired one to completely overhaul my branding/visual identity.
my preferences are for "old fashioned" looking typefaces and layouts, and i'm looking for both a mark and a type that will be my new look.
my avatar shows the logo i've been using for the last 4 years.
the new proposed design is here in this post.

All of my creative work features found objects, 
my line of jewelry is called "Finders Keepers", 
and my tagline is "Redefining Precious." (not "precious redefined" as seen in the file)

i have played with the idea of having my biz card printed on actual cereal boxes  or some other "found" sort of material, but i am open to simply having a design that "feels" old.
the design will be used in everything, including:
storefront signage/hwy signage
packaging and promotional
biz cards and letterhead, etc.
website
labels

some key words that define my work would be:
retro/vintage, repurpose/reclaim, eco, environmentally responsible, handmade, original...the opposite of commercial, mass-produced, common, hi-tech.

thanks to anyone who wants to jump in here.

If you can do this, inexpensively, it is a great idea. It will set you apart in a way that is appropriate, specific, and poetic.


I am getting "old" from the design you posted, but I'm also getting "Western" and "silent film." If that's okay, then you are golden.</div>

i get mixed views on the cereal box idea, so every vote counts! 
i was prepared for and expecting some harsh criticisms from these forms--anyone want to do some "roasting"?
yes, most people i show it to comment on its "western-ness"--i'm more okay with "silent film", but i definitely don't want my company to be perceived as a dealer of western/cowboy themed goods!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">* not sure about the bottom font. It really betrays the silent film or western feel because it seems to be Bank Gothic (1930s) that has a baseline manipulated in photoshop. It feels kinda forced and faux rather than old and authentic.

* sharpening the blurry areas might help with authenticity. The blur to me suggests a computer.

* the DESIGNS might work better in a different font?

		<div class="commentbody">I agree about the Western/Silent Film thing, although I think it works.

Beejay mentioned that the fading isn't authentic. It also isn't consistent -- "Designs" is way more faded than "LaMoore," which makes it seem like it didn't encounter a century worth of dust, wind, and rain. The same goes for the little leafy doodad above it.

Maybe if they run the whole design through the same Fade filter, it would work better, no?

Otherwise, I think the cereal box thing is really awesome! Let us know how that turns out!

		<div class="commentbody">thanks everyone, for the feedback on the design, as well as the cereal box idea--i'm going ahead with the cereal boxes and will try to remember to post a pic when they're finished.
the idea is not my own. i first came across it when i found a letterpress printer offering cereal boxes as a standard choice, and now the latest issue of Craft magazine has it as a featured project.
as for the design, i found inspiration in a post here in the forums--i've put the pics up on the "type ID" board. Thanks for the help!</div>
