  able to answer my question: when designing a font what are the typical characters
  that are included in the superscript, subscript, numerators, denominators and ordinals
  and scientific inferiors? \r\n\r\nTypically Adobe include the characters included
  in the image attached (where red text shows the text that changed when applying
  that style), however, I am wondering if there are any more that should be added?
  Also what is the difference between Subscript and Inferior     and     Superscript
  and Superior? I would be grateful for any feedback. Thank you."

  body: "Looking at Adobe Caslon Pro Regular (v2.092) it looks like they include a
    large part of the [[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2070.pdf|Superscripts and Subscripts
    Unicode codepage]] (these links to Unicode codepages from the Consortium's web
    site may trigger a PDF download depending on your browser, OS and settings) as
    well as those superscript characters that appear in the [[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf|Latin-1
    Supplement Unicode codepage]]. Other Unicode codepages, such as the [[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D00.pdf|Phonetic
    Extensions]] and [[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D80.pdf|Phonetic Extensions
    Supplement]] contain examples of other sub- and superscript characters.\r\n\r\nFor
    more advanced mathematical support there may also be additional sets of non-Unicode
    specific characters to support, for example, a complete set of sub- and superscript
    alphanumeric characters in Latin and non-Latin scripts. If you have access to
    the Cambria Math font this contains a vast range of both kinds.\r\n\r\nI am not
    sure about the differences, but I think that Inferior and Superior refer more
    specifically to usage in scientific, technical and mathematical typesetting and
    composition. The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript_and_superscript|Wikipedia
    page]] might be worthwhile reading on the subject."

  body: "Hi Karl,\r\n\r\nThanks for the Unicode pages, v. helpful. The wikipedia page
    is what was confusing me. I took a look at Cambria (TTF) compared to Adobe Caslon
    Pro (OTF) and there are differences in how things are encoded see below:\r\n\r\nTTF
    Lookup // OTF Lookup\r\nSUPS // SUPS * (See note below)\r\nSINF // ------\r\nNUMR
    // NUMR\r\nDNOM // DNOM\r\nORDN // ------\r\n\r\nOpentype SUPS has two lookups,
    one with a subtable containing a-z lowecase and the other with a subtable with
    all the symbols i.e. 0-9 -$c(),.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to work out how the encoding
    happens for Inferiors and Ordinals (you see opentype has no SINF or ORDN lookups)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Those two fonts would have been engineered very differently. To the best
    of my knowledge both Ross Mills and John Hudson at Tiro worked on Cambria Math
    and would be able to give you insight into how those features were programmed.
    I know based on [[http://typophile.com/node/97490#comment-527694|comments made
    in the Build section]] and elsewhere that John uses VOLT to develop OpenType features
    and so it is possible that this workflow had a completely different impact than
    one using AFDKO as likely used by Adobe.\r\n\r\nWith regard to your original question,
    unless you are developing a font that will likely be used in technical composition
    contexts then you would only really need to include those characters seen in the
    standard Latin-1 Supplement codepage. Personally I would probably also include
    those characters in the Superscript and Subscript codepage as well and leave it
    at that."
