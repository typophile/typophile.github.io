    Design\r\n<em>\"It's very vibrant. We want the vibrance to inspire people, to
    get people really backing the Olympic bid. We passionately believe in the Olympic
    bid and we want other people to actually follow suit and really get behind the
    bid.\"</em>\r\n\r\nBarbara Cassani, Chairman, London Olympic Bid 2012\r\n<em>\"The
    London symbol is the River Thames which flows through us and gives us the heart
    of the city, the backbone of the city. And the shape is also a ribbon, a ribbon
    of colours. The colours represent the diversity of the city, the people who come
    from everywhere, and the ribbon itself is something that's used in sport. It's
    a winners' tape. It's the ribbon from which those gold medals will hang for all
    those people from London and the UK who win the medals in 2012.\"</em>\r\n\r\nScripted
    explaination of logo at the unveiling:\r\n\r\nThe new design for London Olympic
    bid for 2012 has been unveiled at the Tate Modern gallery in London. The ribbon-based
    design, which represents the shape of the River Thames, beat off stiff competition.
    Those behind the bid say it's symbolic of the diversity of London and the Olympic
    spirit. \r\n\r\nThe five-colour ribbon design represents London's main waterway,
    which runs through the heart of the city, and the Olympics games itself. Those
    behind the bid say this is crucial to the bid.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nI
    have always had a keen interest in the development and marketing of Olympic Games
    logos, emblems and identity systems. There are not many projects in design or
    marketing that present themselves every two years (alternating Summer and Winter
    Olympics) and have such a major impact globally.\r\n\r\nHere is an excellent blog
    on designs of 2012 candidate logos:\r\n<a href=\"http://38one.com/cleverblog/place-your-bid\">http://38one.com/cleverblog/place-your-bid</a>"

    Here in New York there was a completely different vibe for the games. I couldn't
    walk anywhere in London without seeing tons of ads. Here in New York, you're lucky
    if you happen to run across a couple. \r\n\r\nI love hand done type as its one
    of my specialities, and I would be inclined to lean toward the Paris logo. It
    just to me feels a little incomplete. My vote (though it has always been unpopular
    in the past) is the New York logo. It has a playful vibe, which I like. Though
    personally speaking I'd like it more if the \"1\" in 2012 had a pseudo-serif on
    it. :)"

  body: "Some comments from <a href=\"http://38one.com/cleverblog/place-your-bid\">cleverblog</a>
    mention that the NYC logo is \"too American\". In my opinion, when you visually
    join the split images of Statue of Liberty on left and victorious olympic athelete
    on right, you get an overall message of \"America wins!\"\r\n\r\nLondon's bid
    logo ribbon motif (in official olympic colors) seems very problematic as an emblem
    that has to stand up for repro on embroidered patches, tiny pins, etc. So I imagine
    that Andy Stanfield will continue to refine the logo before official adoption.\r\n\r\nThe
    Paris bid logo as it stands looks colorful if anything, but weak in treatment.
    The brush forms are not gestured enough to portray energy or movement, and not
    refined enough to evoke visual harmony. As for it's message, deja vu \"I (heart)
    NY\" \"I (heart) Virginia\" and \"I (heart) my dog!\"\r\n\r\nI know it's easy
    to sit back and dis designs, but come on, it's the Olympics of logo design.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,

    yards on the west side of Manhattan valued at over $900 million and they were
    going to sell them to the Jets for $200 million. They have other properties that
    aren't being used or developed, yet, they give the board of directors raises and
    keep raising our subway fares and provide less service (one conductor trains).
    No wonder tbiddy they don't contact you, you might come up with something that
