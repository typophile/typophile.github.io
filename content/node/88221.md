  body: The body was typeset and the name typewritten. In Ye Olden Days, it was not
    unusual for letters set in faux-typewriter foundry type to be printed on a platen
    press using a large, looped typewriter ribbon instead of ink, which helped strengthen
    the illusion that the entire letter was machine-written.

  body: The printed type has a lot of similarities to Stymie. Sort of a "Stymie Monospace".
    It looks different from most typewriter types I can recall.

  body: "I agree with you Nick, does not look like a typewritten ribbon impression.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    even the stains look simulated, almost too symmetrically distributed.\r\n\r\nThe
    crease coloring looks suspicious, I wonder if this could be a fabrication of sorts?\r\n\r\nDame
    hard to figure things out unless we actually had the piece, in hand, to examine
    ourselves.\r\n\r\nNice sample, sure reminds me of the 1950s. Like taking a step
    back in time. "

  body: Could the form letter have been printed through a carbon paper? Not sure about
    the gloss, but this tends to make the text look darker. Though it would've also
    blurred the text.

  body: ">  mimeographed ... some chemicals to transfer what \r\n> was typed onto
    a metal sheet \r\n\r\nPerhaps there were different types of mimeographs. In my
    first job I had to mimeograph a weekly newsletter and no metal sheets or chemicals
    (except ink) were involved.\r\n\r\nI removed the typewriter ribbon and typed on
    a stencil, which felt like a sheet of waxy paper. The typewriter punched through
    the stencil's waxy layer, but a bottom layer which was permeable stayed intact.
    Then I wrapped the stencil around an inked drum. The ink would ooze through the
    areas cut out by the typewriter.\r\n\r\nThe waxy stencil would deteriorate after
    printing a few hundred copies. Perhaps the metal sheet you mentioned was used
    in jobs where more durable materials were needed to print larger quantities."

  body: James, the one I remember using worked in a similar way, except that, if I
    remember correctly, one didn't write directly on the stencil, but there was some
    processinvolved  between typewritten sheet of paper and the sheet applied to the
    drum. I don't remember the process except for the smell.

  body: "I just remembered that there was an optional method in which a small machine
    scanned the layout and created a stencil or printing plate from that scan. \r\n\r\nIf
    I remember correctly, that method reduced the overall quality slightly, but it
    made it easier to produce more complicated layouts and/or include illustrations.
    (If you produced the stencil directly on your typewriter without a scanner, illustrations
    needed to be drawed directly on the stencil, or else you needed to purchase pre-made
    stencil illustrations that were then cut and pasted into the stencil. I did that
    occasionally and it was a pain.)\r\n\r\nSince the scanning method required the
    purchase of a special scanner, it was probably used mostly by larger organizations
    that could afford the extra expense."

  body: "<cite>Perhaps there were different types of mimeographs.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    never handled the printer but I am fairly sure it could be used as a mimeograph,
    i.e. you could put directly the typewritten waxed paper on it and print; that's
    how most handouts would have been produced. However, for our newspaper,   what
    was typed on the waxed paper was transferred onto a plate; the same machine would
    then be used as an offset printer. I googled and found no reference on such machines
    that could do both. So far as I understand, when used as a mimeograph, the ink
    would have to be put inside the barrel; if a plate is used, the ink needs to be
    put somewhere else, I guess. I dont' remember that there were two printers but
    maybe it was so (the year was 1964-1965)."
