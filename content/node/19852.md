  first (sample 1) is a handwriting Script.\r\nThe second (sample 2) is a modern Sans
  Serif. I know this one but can't remember the name or Foundry.\r\n\r\nThank's\r\n\r\n"

    pretty easy to make. \r\n\r\nBut I could be wrong, I don't really know many script
    faces."

  body: "I thought maybe the script looked like some of Ronna Penner's scripts, but
    it's not an exact match to any I found. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/sweet-pea/\">Sweet
    Pea</a> is fairly similar, but that's the most I can say about it. A few of her
    others also resemble it a bit. \r\n\r\nI also looked at Rob Leuschke's work, but
    nothing was very close. \r\n\r\nSeeing the language used, this could be from a
    Scandinavian font designer -- an area we don't see enough of to know very well,
    speaking for myself.\r\n\r\nIf someone does ID it, I would like to add it to the
    Script Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    think it's Portuguese. Nice script indeed, but maybe custom or proprietary. The
    line quality is nice and rough."
