  body: "Geez, it's been so long since I've done any real handwork, it's hard to remember,
    but...\r\n\r\nI was seriously into Rapidographs, with a complete range from 6x0
    (about a gnat's eyelash in width) to 6 (used about a half bottle of ink for every
    twenty feet ruled); two Rapidograph ruling compasses (a small drop compass, which
    handled radii down to a sixteenth of an inch, and a large, far more precise one
    with worm-gear adjustment that could tackle radii to about four inches); a free-flowing
    India ink (whose name I cannot recall, but decidedly necessary for very fine-point
    pens); and Linekote illustration board. Both Rapidograph compasses had leadholder
    inserts, so you could use non-repro blue lead to plan your work, then swap out
    the appropriate penpoint to work your plan.\r\n\r\nAnother handy tool was white
    mylar tape for corrections and adding traps. The mylar version was much thinner
    than regular white tape (fewer problems with shadows), and a lot tougher (you
    could cut VERY tiny slivers for traps). And, of course, a whole slew of Alvin
    templates often came in handy."

  body: I don't do a lot of actual typeform design off the computer, but I do tend
    to make prepatory studies of stroke and contrast patterns using different writing
    implements and techniques. The most useful addition to my analogue toolkit this
    year has been an Osmiroid copperplate nib. This is a discontinued item, but I
    found a couple on eBay. It is, as far as I know, the only split-nib attachment
    available for a cartridge pen, and it much more convenient than getting out the
    pot of ink and my various old nibs and holders.

    to use a lot of red Zipatone instead of ink for filling in large areas. Plus a
    ton of ellipse and circle templates and french curves. (What do they call french

    be into pilot razor points, but when I had one explode on me I switched to staedtler
    triplus fineliners.\r\n\r\nThe rapidographs and steel pens are 1/2 tool fetishism
    (gearism?), and 1/2 practical. Something about using tools like this forces you
    to consider the marks you make on paper. There is a deliberation to each penstroke...
    but then, at the same time the carefulness can sometimes kill the spontenaity
    of sketches. I also like the quality of the india on paper. It doesn't bleed like
    felt tips, is completely opaque, and (depending on technique) doesn't make indents
    on the paper.\r\n\r\nThe most obscure tool I actually use is a \"Wrico lettering
    pen\" (#6), but it's messy, and I find that I spend more time with preparation
    and clean-up then I do with drawing."
