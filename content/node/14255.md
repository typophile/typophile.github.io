  [[Small Capitals|Small Caps]] are more than just scaled-down versions of the [[Capital|Capital
  Letters]]. [[John Hudson]] gave some tips on how to make smallcaps efficiently in
  [[FontLab]] by starting with the capital letters as a foundation.\r\n\r\n1. Scale
  the [[uppercase]] letter uniformly to the desired height and put into the background
  [[mask layer]]. This will be the guide not only for height, but also for internal
  space. So, for example, the distance between the [[uprights]] of the scaled H will
  be the distance, inner edge to inner edge, of the uprights in the smallcap. This
  will produce smallcaps that are nicely proportioned relative to each other (presuming
  that your caps are nicely proportioned). [See Fig.1]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fig1_5825.gif]\r\n\r\n2.
  Paste in another copy of the cap [[outlines]], and scale these uniformly for weight.
  I usually match the vertical [[stem weight]] of my smallcaps to my [[lowercase]],
  even though the smallcaps will be taller. [See Fig.2]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fig2_4926.gif]\r\n\r\n3.
  Use the FontLab \u2018[[Interpolate]]\u2019 function to reduce the height and width
  of the weight-adjusted caps to match the height and internal space of the mask.
  This should be done in two passes: one for the y-direction and one for the x-direction.
  Be careful to maintain weights. [See Figs.3-6]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fig3_5498.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fig4_5646.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fig5_6467.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fig6_6622.gif]\r\n\r\n4.
  Test and fiddle. [See Fig.7]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fig7_5090.gif]\r\n\r\n<a
