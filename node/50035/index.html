		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, James. That Wikipedia article answered my question (I knew it was a musical sharp, but I wasn't sure how it differed physically from a number sign). Looking at the Wikipedia article, it looks like the number sign has two horizontal lines and two angled lines, while the sharp sign has two vertical lines and two angled lines.

I'm pretty surprised more fonts don't include the sharp sign, actually. It seems one of the musical notations that is common enough (even outside of the musical context) to warrant inclusion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Musical notation isn’t usually shown inline with other text, and AFAIK, most transcription is done using software that includes the fonts. And like math fonts, there are also good free or very inexpensive music fonts out there, which doesn’t leave much of a commercial market open.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As with any other character, you can't absolutely define how a sharp should look, but it will always have these characteristics: the two horizontal lines are slanted upwards (they would straddle the stave lines if preceding a note which is in a stave space, otherwise they would fall between two stave lines); the two vertical lines are not slanted, and the rightmost of the two is slightly higher (matching the slant of the vertical lines); also the vertical lines are thin whereas the horizontal lines are thickened. The space between the vertical lines should also be less than that between the horizontal lines, somewhat.

If designing a sharp for a font especially for use in music (and most such fonts are really awful) then there would be other things to take into account, such as how long the verticals should be. (I realise, of course, that this doesn't really answer your primary question of how it differs from a #, but you have that answer already) :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sharp and flat are actually the most likely music symbols to be seen in with text, as they can go with the letter names of notes.

For my part, I will never understand why "sharp" has the symbol that looks like a planar grid while "flat" has the symbol that looks like a pointy little spear.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The sharp and flat can be useful in texts that make reference to works of classical music. Most often the key signature is spelled out completely. Some styles will prefer to employ the symbolic abbreviation. 

In casual use, the number sign can stand in for the sharp. Less convincingly, the lowercase b has been pressed into service in place of the flat -- e.g., Concerto for Horn and Orchestra No. 3 in Eb major, K. 447.

I've been considering including the sharp and flat in the OT version of Whitman, as well as other designs in progress.

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, better include the natural symbol as well.

Take a look at <cite>Bach Perspectives</cite> Vol. 1, or some of the Yale Broadway series titles. <cite>Bach Perspectives</cite> is a pretty good source for how far a text aimed at an academic (but still general) musical audience can go.

[Boy, that's a rough sentence. I mean that the <cite>Bach Perspectives</cite> assumes an academic audience with an interest & knowledge about music, but isn't targeted for musicologists only.]

The Broadway series is aimed at a general audience, period. Of course, the number of symbols used in the Broadway series are fewer, and varies from title to title -- really, author to author.
