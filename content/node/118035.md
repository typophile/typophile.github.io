    knock-off, Swiss:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-721/\r\n\r\nTake
    a look at  Swiss 721 Extended Black, and you'll see the same over-curvature of
    the \"r.\" That only appears in the condensed versions of other Helveticas.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is, that curvature only appear in Swiss Black, not Bold. If you want to
    duplicate the exact look of the original, set it in Swiss Extended Black and experiment
    with adding a colored (depends on the background) stroke to the type to mimic
    the same visual weight.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Kthomps5. Swiss is certainly close, however the letter shapes are
    a little different, the above feels slightly more rectangular/geometric in the
    way it rounds out it's letters \u2013 like the \"d\". It almost has a hint on
    Univers to it. From looking at the other fonts in the magazine, I feel like the
    above must have been a listed in a letraset catalogue at some point in time."

    is not pre-digital. Bitstream, the company which made Swiss, started out as a
    digital type foundry with a digital type library \u2018already in stock\u2019
    as from the first day. Their main goal was to be sell digital typefaces in any
    format to so-called OEM-manufacturers such as producers of laser printers. Yes,
    this was before PostScript, but both digital type and digital outline font technology
    are at least two decades resp. one decade older than PostScript."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/XeroxInUse_5549.jpg]\r\nAn old time Helvetica
    knock off by Ares Software Corp. under the name Xerox Bold. The _r_ is an _n_
    with everything below 2:30 p.m. clipped off. I tightened the sidebearings for
    purposes of this sample. Unfortunately no known legitimate source.\r\nCould get
    somewhat similar results by tinkering with Helvetica Neue 63 Ext Medium https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-63-medium-extended/
    which seems to have some slightly more rounded aspects, like the counter in _c_,
    and differences like the heavy tail on _a_.\r\nFor out of the box, might as well
    go with Brazilia Seven despite its lack of contrast.\r\nDon"
