body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am trying to solve some triplets kerning problems in a script
  font without designing more characters.\r\nI thought I could use contextual kerning
  (LookupType 8, chaining contextual positioning) but when I try to set something
  like \r\n\r\nfeature kern {\r\nposition d space' 20 D ;\r\n} kern;\r\n\r\nI get
  the message \"Cannot mark positioning glyphs\". What is the problem? Is 'kern' not
  the proper feature to place such substitution? In this case, which should be the
  proper feature to set my contextual positioning?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nR."

    Studio 5.1 because it uses a newer version of the Adobe FDK thank FLS 5.0.\r\n"

    now it does not give error message BUT there is not effect on the addressed glyphs
    (either in the preview window or generating and testing the font)."

  body: "VOLT does not decompile OTL tables, so the data needs to be either in the
    plain text formats used to store and transfer VOLT projects, lookups, groups or
    glyph set data (.vtp, .vtl, .vtg, .vtd) or in the private table binary format
    in which VOLT projects are stored within a source TTF). FontLab offers an option
    to 'Export VOLT data' when generating a TTF, which I think means it will try to
    write the private table, but I don't think it is very reliable. You would probably
    need to rebuild your features and lookups in VOLT.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you should
    be able to use the AFDKO v.2 outside of FontLab to compile your feature code.
    Or you could use DTL OTMaster."
