  inches for real estate signage\r\n\r\nI am not allowed to redesign the logo for
  Trend Setter Realty and <em>must</em> be included in the sign. Also, I am awaiting
  the correct files from the National Association of Realtors\u2014they have a malfunctioning
  eps file for download. The wording is clients choice, but I can make changes.\r\n\r\nFonts
  are Relato Sans Medium and Sanuk Fat from you-know-where.\r\n\r\nIf you have some
  ideas post images and I\u2019ll try it your way.\r\n\r\nThanks guys et gals,\r\n\r\nMike

    Trend Setter logo until it stretches across the entire sign, and move it to the
    top\u2014so that the sign becomes the logo, then you could enlarge the blue area
    to fill the space below to put your text.\r\n\r\nAt least that's the first thing
    that popped into my head."

  body: "Bringing back nightmares =) I design ads for a newspaper where I live and
    I have to go through these all the time. This is suppose to be a sign? Where is
    it going to be hung? Is it suppose to be one of those signs that hangs in front
    of a house they are selling? If so...you need to think about what is more important
    to the driver/walker by.\r\n\r\nRight now, it looks like it should go in a newspaper
    as an ad. It's basically saying hey are you moving? then call here, and then you
    finally get to the bottom where you see who you will be calling.\r\n\r\nIf you
    are doing a sign in front of a house on the market, then people want to know that
    it's for sale first, then who's selling it, then where to call. Everything else
    should take a back seat.\r\n\r\nBut for the record, the ads that I do are mostly
    for small/private business' that want to have an ad in the newspaper to get extra
    money. So those ads that you posted as the \"stay away from\" ads actually prove
    to be very successful in getting business, because they are simple and get across
    the point almost instantly. \"Form follows Function\".\r\n\r\n\r\ncourtney"

    Maybe block the upper question, red on white? Maybe try \"Welcome to Canyon Lakes
    West\", kind of friendly.\r\n\r\nColor is very important. Red and yellow catches
    the eye, it can come off as obnoxious, is it the most readable? Yellow and black
    are the most readable, but ugly.\r\n\r\nI'm glad to see you trying to break the
    mold!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks guys for the input thus far.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sign is aimed at \u201Cinexperienced\u201D
    buyers interested one particular housing development\u2013 namely Canyon Lakes
    West. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the sign the real estate agents uses in front of the
    home. \r\nIt\u2019s also not a sign commissioned by the Canyon Lakes developer,
    but it is in fact from a real estate agent trying to get buyers to use him to
    purchase real estate in the Canyon Lake West area.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be
    stapled to telephone poles and staked on the corners of empty street lots.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    desperately trying to avoid American patriotic colors... YUCK!\r\n\r\nAnd yes
    there needs to be more separation of the the question \u201CMoving to Canyon Lakes
    West?\u201D.\r\n\r\nAny more ideas...???\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "In avoiding American patriotic colors, you've gone over to Chinese Communist
    colors instead? Anything is tough to read on a red field, since it reads simultaneously
    as a bright and dark color.\r\n\r\nAt least they aren't asking for headshots on
    the signs. Realtors love to show people what they look like, regardless of their
    appearance. Portraits on business collateral should be reserved for performers
    and prostitutes."

  body: "I sent my client the new designs. He loves it right (his favorite the blue
    and yellow iteration ala IKEA), then he tells me that color printing will cost
    too much... after he told me that he wanted color initially. \r\n\r\nI put it
    in black and white, Sanuk Fat is too fat... you\u2019re right , its tuff to read.
    I use something else. It looks just okay but the client loves it.\r\n\r\nHe still
    likes the original design. He\u2019s gonna use it for a huge magnet sign that
    going to be attached to the side of his truck and the tail gate.\r\n\r\nOh well...
    thanks anyway guys"

    and charge a design fee. Go with color!!!
