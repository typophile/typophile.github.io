  \"1978\" Sex Pistols flyer]]. But a closer look reveals what looks an awful lot
  like Comic Sans, released in 1994.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_01_5604.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo,
  is the flyer a fake? Or was Comic Sans drawn from an older face? And not to get
  all \"Type I.D. Board\" or anything, but do any other letters here seem out of place
  for 1978?\r\n\r\n"

    I\u2019m guessing that Christies did a bad job authenticating the flyer, you might
    want to let them know."

    he drew Comic Sans from the letters in D.C. Comics' Watchmen. Which, like you
    said, was lettered by Dave Gibbons in the 80's. Obviously too late to appear on
    this flyer.\r\n\r\nThough it looks exactly like Comic Sans, is it outside the
    realm of possibilities that the word \"land\" was snipped from from something
    Dave Gibbons lettered in the 70's? If another post-1978 typeface could be identified
    from the flyer, it'd be easier to call shenanigans. "

    (post-Beatle) for plagiarizing the melody of <em>He\u2019s So Fine</em> to write
    <em>My Sweet Lord</em>. Like Comic Sans, the creative work was so primitive, it
    was inevitable that two people would invent it independently. "

    would say so. The text is exactly like Comic Sans, even down to metrics--spacing
    and alignment! If it were taken from lettering, even by the source artist of Comic
    Sans, it's unlikely that any four letters would correspond exactly to how they
    ended up in the font.\r\n"

    said flyer from the auction.

  body: Pick up a copy of Watchmen, guys. I can't believe you can look at Comic Sans
    and say it might be Dave Gibbons' lettering. Connare's story may be technically
    true, in that it served as inspiration for a rush job by someone who had never
    seriously examined comic-book lettering before, but to say it was actually "based
    on" or "drawn from" the lettering in Watchmen is just silly.

    the lettering in Watchmen is just silly.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt may have been a rush
    job, but Connare (i.e. the creator of Comic Sans) says, \"I pretty much referenced
    the Watchman. And I was trying to copy the letter forms. And these are all hand
    drawn, so all the letters are different. I just drew them out very quickly.\"
    To me, that says \"Comic Sans is based on the lettering in Watchmen.\" It's a
    valid statement, regardless of whether or not he did a good job at making a digital
    version of Gibbons' handwriting.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe I'm just not a sufficiently
    discriminatory comic-book-lettering aficionado, but I looked at samples from Watchmen.
    I looked at Comic Sans. I believe the designer's story that he based Comic Sans
    on the lettering in Watchmen.\r\n\r\n<em>Edit:</em> I think I may have misunderstood.
    It is absurd to say that the \"LAND\" in the flyer could be Dave Gibbons' lettering.
    It's a point-perfect specimen of Comic Sans. But I don't think it's absurd to
    say that Comic Sans is based on Dave Gibbons' lettering."
