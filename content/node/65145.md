  body: Another close match, Eurostile Condensed in particular. But the 'G' and 'P'
    are slightly different.

  body: Hmm... The G seems to be a little different than Monoline.  I'd think it was
    modified, however the G is found in other collateral on the site and it is consistent
    which I doubt they would modify each time.

  body: I saw this somewhere the other day and tracked down a .pdf to try and ID the
    typeface. On the .pdf I downloaded they were using Monoline. I can't explain the
    differences though, and don't have the time to look. I would think they could
    have commissioned a custom version of this.
