body: "I\u2019m sure many of you have worked with Morph Input Files. Not so many,
  I suppose, with the so-called Kerning Input Files. One possible reason might be
  that the file format has never been actually released by Apple, and no apparent
  support exist in OS X Font Tools. I\u2019ve heard the format itself was once mentioned
  in Apple\u2019s docs, but it was all redacted afterwards.\r\n\r\nI needed to build
  some state machine kerning for few of my projects, and I was tired of writing it
  in hex by hand, so I wrote a shell script that does exactly that. It reads an approximation
  of the mythical Kerning Input File and prints out hex data for a whole kerning table
  that can be fused into a font with Apple's tools as generic table data. The input
  syntax is based on the Morph Input File, and should be easy enough for people that
  ever worked with MIF itself.\r\n\r\nThere are two gotchas though. First, the script
  expects state machine kerning only. Dealing with other formats shouldn't be hard
  to implement, but it's not a priority for me. Second, the recently introduced extended
  kerning table (kerx) is not yet fully documented, so you get the old kern table
  for now. Still, this shouldn't be considered an issue, as the old table works well
  in CoreText on both OS X and iOS.\r\n\r\nThe script is called kiftohex and you can
  find it with all the details and sample code at https://github.com/grzegorzrolek/kiftohex/.
  Hope somebody will find it useful."

  body: "I moved the whole thing to [[http://github.com/grzegorzrolek/kif-compiler/|a
    new repo]] and made it build both <code>kerx</code> and <code>ankr</code> tables
    during the past year. It means you can work with both state machine-based kerning
    and the new control-point positioning as found in those tables.\r\n\r\nThis was
    before John Jenkins from Apple announced an upcoming update to their Font Tool
    Suite, a release that I assume will be pushing forward Apple\u2019s new input
    format for building AAT, the Advanced Typography Input File, or ATIF, which is
    probably better-suited for the more common use cases. Nevertheless, when it comes
    to state machines with non-trivial state chains, I still find MIF, or for that
    matter KIF, often much easier to follow at a glance than ATIF."
