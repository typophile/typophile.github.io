  numerals designed. Lining numerals have their usual names, and I named the old-styles
  so that they have the \".onum\" suffix (e.g. \"one.onum\"). \r\n\r\nHow do I go
  about implementing an open type feature for the old style numerals?  I'd assume
  that I go to the open type panel, hit \"+\", and the new \"xxxx\" feature appears.
  But what next? When I try renaming the \"xxxx\" feature so that it says:\r\n\r\nfeature
  onum {\r\n  sub by ;\r\n} onum;\r\n\r\nI get compile errors. Where & how do I add
  the numbers? I was checking the FL manual, but I'm not getting far with it. Can
  somebody point me to any resoruce or explain how adding an OT feature such as old-style
  numerals works in a nutshell?\r\n\r\nI'm using FL 4.6 on a Mac \r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The code that is inserted into the OpenType panel when you hit the \"+\"
    button is a stub--it's incomplete and you are expected to complete it. You got
    halfway there by changing \"xxxx\" to \"onum,\" but you've got to finish the job.
    \"sub by ;\" needs to say something like \"sub one by one.onum ;\". This is what
    is called a one-to-one substitution in OpenType feature speak. What it means is
    that the normal \"one\" will be substituted by \"one.onum\" when the user asks
    for old style numerals. You have to add a line like this for every number. It
    should look something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>feature onum {\r\nsub one by one.onum
    ;\r\nsub two by two.onum ;\r\nsub three by three.onum ;</code>\r\n\r\nand so on,
    finishing up with:\r\n\r\n<code>} onum;</code>\r\n\r\nIt can get more complicated
    than this--for instance if you have both proportional and tabular figures--but
    that's basically it. (It's all covered in the manual, by the way.)"

  body: "Thanks a lot everyone. Figured it out. I would have had it earlier if I had
    only scrutinized the manual :).\r\n\r\nAnd subing classes seems like THE way to
    go.\r\n\r\nI posted Kaled Sans for the cirtique over <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/19445\">in
    the neighborhood</a>. You can see my old style's feature at work <a href=\"http://ebukva.cidamon.com/type/Picture4.png\">in
    this image</a>.\r\n\r\nNow, one more question: Are there advantages to doing the
    kerning as an OT feature as opposed to the kerning table in metrics? Since I'm
    jsut starting to kern, should I just go for the OT kern feature?\r\n\r\nEmir\r\n\r\n

  body: "That depends. The spec for PostScript-flavored OT (CFF) fonts says that a
    kerning table is not supported, meaning you must use class kerning. TrueType-flavored
    OT (TTF) fonts may have either or both. In fact, FontLab will let you include
    either or both in both flavors of OT fonts.\r\n\r\nThat said, class kerning is
    the way to go. It takes a bit more planning, but it's more efficient and thorough."

  body: "It seems there was another aspect to your question:\r\nFor direct visual
    control, you should use the Metrics Window for kerning. This also allows you to
    use classes. Then -- whether you used classes or not -- you go to the Metrics
    Assistance panel and hit the \"update kern feature\" button which generates a
    kern feature for you.\r\nThis way, your plain kerning table and the kern feature
    are (or at least: could be) equivalent for one is generated from the other."

    and need the table. That is why I think Karsten's solution is best.  It gives
    you both and they are the same.  Also, you can see it well in the metrics window
    as you do it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Here's the deal, though: With CFF fonts, the old-style kern table will never
    get used. OT-savvy apps will use the kern feature; non-OT-savvy apps get a synthesized
    kern table based on the kern feature. So, even though you <em>can</em> include
    a kern table in an OT CFF font using FontLab, it will simply be taking up space.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    there was recently a discussion about this on the OpenType list. Adam Twardoch
    was advocating that kern tables should be supported in OT CFF fonts just as they
    are in OT TTF fonts. Judging from the discussion, it doesn't sound like it will
    likely happen."

    I only addressed one question, how to get consistent results among kern table
    & kern feature.\r\n\r\nYou are right, according to the current specs, only the
    kern feature should be present in PS-flavored OTFs. Personally, I stick to this.
    Too much redundant information in OTFs already ... (Also, in an earlier test I
    had the impression that some application ignored kerning completely if both table
    and feature were present, but forgot the details and cannot -- nor do I want to
    -- reproduce this.)"
