  within a paragaph begins \"ACC is aware of the...\".\r\nNow, do I use a normal capital
  A, then two lc 'c's?. This looks like 'Acc' becuase the small caps 'C' looks very
  similar to a lc 'c'.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n- Chris"

    and see which looks better with the color of the paragraph?\r\n\r\n--Jim K."

  body: "This problem is not typographically solvable, but requires editing (re-keying):\r\n1.
    Rewrite the sentence so that ACC is not the first word, or\r\n2. Spell it out
    in full.\r\n"

  body: "Another approach is to use all caps for ACC but at a slightly smaller size
    than the full caps. This is the New Yorker's style for acronyms when there are
    no periods.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming by the way you wrote your post that ACC should
    be all caps to begin with."

  body: "Is ACC referenced anywhere in the body of text before that sentence? Standard
    writing practices would be, if it's appearing for the first time, to write it
    as, \"A Common Cold (ACC) is aware that there is no real cure.\u2026\". Then after
    that it is acceptable to refer to the acronym. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you follow the
    \"never start a sentence with a #\" rule, spelling it out would be a perfectly
    acceptable alternative. Or stick a filler word like 'the' in front. "
