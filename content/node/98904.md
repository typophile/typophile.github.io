body: Ah, Christmastime, where I get 72 dpi logos from relatives of people who set
  up booths at craft fairs, and am asked to put them on a banner.  In this case, I've
  got this font that I need to reproduce.  It's cursive with a brush like texture,
  probably found on a free font site.  Any ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Business
