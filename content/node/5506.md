  kind of adventure trip,  from the lightest  to the most exciting. Critics will be
  wellcome. Thank you. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40068.jpg"

  body: hi sergio <BR> <BR>i think N is the only character that has bad legibility,
    i like the stencil type you are using, and i am wondering why you didn&#39;t use
    it on the G, stencil types have a big adventure spirit. <BR> <BR>although i like
    the flourish kind of thing on your N and G, i think that you should stay with
    the stencil, cause flourish type&#43;stencil&#43;thecircle is too much.  <BR>
    <BR>i think that the letters in the circle you should increase them at small sizes
    for better lecture, and maybe you can give less contrast between the the circle
    and the black to read NATURAL HIGH better. <BR> <BR>well done <BR> <BR>CG

    with intended target market.  <BR>Big adventure? Makes me think more of abstract
    theater performance. I think starting from scratch would be the way to go. Forget
    what you like personally, and stick with what sells for the client and audience.

    a more traditional or expected design approach, but maybe it can provide some
