    doesn't work for headings--hence the double dash. And is kerning missing also
    in the headings? "

    off too.    ;(     Maybe someday all those bells and whistles can be presented
    online. I still think it's very cool they can use a specific typeface for headers
    at all. Not to mention transparency etc. "
