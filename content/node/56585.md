  body: "The quick technique in FontLab is called class kerning. That means quickly
    explained that you kern groups of similar shapes together, instead of kerning
    every letter against every other letter.\r\n\r\nFor instance on the right side
    of O, the D have a similar shape, and if spaced properly you can kern every D
    at the same time you kern the O. In the long run you save a lot of time.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a little bit tricky at first (at least for me) to understand it completely, but
    I think trial and error together with some reading here on other threads and in
    the FontLab manual is the only way to master this."

  body: Fontlab can auto-generate the classes (read the manual), but nothing compared
    to manually adding and fine-tuning  those classes yourself.
