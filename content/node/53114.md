  body: geez, it's a nice typeface, but i am bummed it is so expensive, about 130
    USD just for that 1 weight it comes in. I understand why fonts are so expensive,
    but man, they sure do make it hard for students like me to ever be able to afford
    them for projects.

  body: "$130 is fairly pricey for a single weight. It's a beautiful face, though,
    and perhaps Lineto's \"boutique\" pricing of Kada reflects their desire to give
    its purchasers a measure of exclusivity. Or to make a little extra cash while
    that particular style is in vogue.\r\n\r\nConsider taking a typeface you already
    own and adding your own unique treatment. Or search MyFonts, Fontshop and the
    freeware sites for rounded/stencil fonts that are in your price range."
