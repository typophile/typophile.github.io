  by Marriott logo (just the relevant portion is shown here):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fairfield_6473.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  don't think the <em>Fairfield</em> and <em>Inn</em> are the same (the serifs look
  a little different, and the <em>Inn</em> looks heavier as well), but just posting
  the <em>Inn</em> may not be particularly helpful. The <em>Inn</em> is all I really
  need to replicate, though.\r\n\r\nAssistance is most appreciated!"

  body: "Based on the suggestion of Goudy, I played around with it in Illustrator
    this morning. When attempting to change the fill colour, I accidentally added
    a stroke to some type I set in Goudy Extra Bold, and, what do you know, it came
    pretty darn close. I should be able to play with the stroke and tracking and get
    it pretty close to perfect.\r\n\r\nThanks for setting me on the right path!"

    good to have a resource like this - didn't realize it was already there. Thanks
    for the link.\r\n\r\nThe Fairfield Inn sample there is totally different though. "

  body: "That one must be an older one. The second one on that page is the one they
    currently use.\r\n\r\nMy problem was that my client is a Fairfield <em>Inn & Suites</em>
    location, and, try as I might, I couldn't find a version of this logo (hence needing
    to know what they used for <em>Inn</em> so I could add <em>& Suites</em>). I have
    found BotW indispensable in the past, though, and didn't even think to check there
    first."
