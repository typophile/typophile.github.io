  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi, new poster here (although I&rsquo;ve lurked around the margins for a while)&hellip;  If I may, I&rsquo;d appreciate some opinions on a new serif typeface I&rsquo;m designing.</p>
<p>This is my first attempt at a serif typeface, and my first serious attempt at a font fit for general consumption (my previous work has been for rather specialized uses).</p>
<p>Some remarks about my intentions&hellip; I basically set out to explore the possibilities of a humanist typeface with non-traditional styling.  (The serifs are loosely intended to recall engraved inscriptions, by the way.)  In the future I plan on adding at least partial Japanese support, and one of my other objectives is to see if it&rsquo;s possible to create a consistent style between the Latin and Japanese characters that manages to be culturally faithful to both.  (Most general-purpose Japanese fonts are woefully generic-looking, especially the serif/mincho ones.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primarily intended as a document font that can also function reasonably well on-screen.  The serifs are deliberately understated to help the text render with minimal distraction.</p>
<p>Letter designs:  [[http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/new_inscription/letters.png]]
Sample text at various sizes:  [[http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/new_inscription/text_sample.png]]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of a number of extant problems.  The strokes need to be darker in general (and the harmonization of stroke widths needs work).  I&rsquo;m also thinking the contrast needs to be increased a little.  For printed text, the character spacing may be a little tight.  As far as the specific glyphs go, I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced by a few characters, in particular some of the numbers.  I&rsquo;m also wondering if the serifs might not be a bit <em>too</em> understated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d welcome opinions from more experienced hands!  Thanks&hellip;</p>

<p>The first thing you should do is decide what point size range you&rsquo;re shooting for this, because that&rsquo;s what will lead you to a good balance of color versus spacing versus vertical proportions (noting for starters that the descenders are way too long compared to the ascenders).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good point about the descenders&hellip; I&rsquo;d overlooked that but on closer examination I have to agree with you.</p>
<p>The 10-12 point range is my main target, I suppose.  I plan to do a couple of other weights, though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually a computer programmer by background&hellip; I stumbled into typeface design pretty much by accident – around ten years ago, I did a hasty mock-up of an old bitmap font to help myself create some user interface drawings, and the result somehow got adopted as the main menu &amp; dialog font for several software programs.   So I&rsquo;ve been trying to catch up on learning all I can about proper type design ever since.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve grown quite fascinated with the subject now&hellip;  a fondness for Japanese writing and calligraphy came along separately, but I figure I should find a way to combine the interests. :)</p>
<p>This is a learning exercise as much as anything else.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ah, I&rsquo;m also a programmer by training (although I&rsquo;ve become quite rusty). Wrote my first program at age 9 on a Commodore PET, but in the early 80s made bitmap fonts for my C64 (with my brother&rsquo;s help) and even my Computer Science degree couldn&rsquo;t stop my eventual move to type design - although there is very much some overlap (especially these days). One thing I think computer people are good at in type design is spacing - let me know if you feel that too.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re shooting for around 11 point I&rsquo;d say the color (thickness) needs to be bumped up (as you say) but the x-height is good - just shorten the descenders (quite a bit though). Also, the caps are on the big side - which means they&rsquo;re good at reference texts (where a reader has to search for proper nouns) but not so much for immersive reading.</p>

The /f, long-s and eszett share a slightly flatter curve now.  Most significantly, I&rsquo;ve bumped up the stroke contrast, especially on the bowls.</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip; the current caps height works reasonably well at the smallest point sizes.  You do have a point, though, especially at the larger sizes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll up the colour a bit in the coming days.  I suspect I&rsquo;ll keep something close to the current incarnation to develop into a &ldquo;light&rdquo; weight, though.</p>
<p>I tweaked the /Z a little in this iteration – specifically, I made the top bar a bit shorter, which may help a bit.  The /M and /W I&rsquo;ll take a look at.</p>

<p>The capitals may still look a little large next to the lowercase, but I think part of that is due to the overly-compressed letter-spacing.  I need to space things out a bit more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about how well the tail on the /u and /d works.  Anyone have thoughts on that?</p>
<p>I added the proposed new uppercase Eszett character, mainly because I could. :p</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ve deliberately drawn the foot of the long-s without a serif, in order to differentiate it better from /f.  For consistency it was thus left off the regular eszett which is derived from it.  Does that seem like a good idea/bad idea/acceptable quirk?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks.  I do think it&rsquo;s getting steadily better.</p>
<p>There are many adjustments in the latest release, which can be seen in the attached suzuran_120629.pdf (above) or in <a href="http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/new_inscription/letters_5.png">http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/new_inscription/letters_5.png</a></p>
<p>Changes of note include reworking the serifs to make them sturdier-looking, adjusting the &lsquo;e&rsquo; crossbar, trying to harmonize the bowl weights (still needs some work IMO), and smoothing out a lot of the counters (especially in the lowercase).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, though&hellip; there&rsquo;s still something not quite satisfactory about it, which I especially notice in paragraphs at 10-12pt.  I think maybe the stroke contrast might need to be increased still more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking I should change the numbers to text (rather than lining) figures.  I&rsquo;m not really a big fan of old-style figures but in this case I think they fit the style a bit more.  (Since I&rsquo;m using Typetool I have no way to add OpenType features, so it&rsquo;s pretty much one or the other.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, I agree that /W is too narrow.  For some reason I was originally reluctant to let it get too much wider than /M, but I don&rsquo;t quite recall why anymore.</p>
<p>When you say to make the bowls larger, I assume you mean vertically rather than width-wise?</p>
<p>The tail on /Q could be a bit more prominent, it&rsquo;s true.  On the other hand, I&rsquo;m not generally a big fan of tails that sweep under adjacent characters, which is why it&rsquo;s confined to its own glyph space.  I may revisit that, though.</p>
<p>These and the other suggestions here certainly have merit, I&rsquo;ll look at each of them carefully.  Thanks!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s concerning me at the moment is the oblique weighting in characters like /O/o, /C/c and to a certain extent /e.  I&rsquo;m starting to think those characters are &lsquo;leaning&rsquo; too far to the left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently rather busy preparing to move from Japan to Canada so I don&rsquo;t expect to get much work done on this for the next several weeks&hellip;</p>

<p>Among the many changes since July: the tops of x-height stems have been raised very slightly, the letter-spacing has been tightened up,  the /O/o/C/c/Q/e have been heavily reworked, /n and /u were narrowed a tad, and /S /s and /Z /z received significant overhauls.

		<div class="commentbody">Looking good. 
Serif at the top of C and G maybe hangs too low, and its shape might need tweaking.
Extending the right baseline serif of r and f more would ease spacing gaps.
The diagonal of 5 looks too slanted to me.
The accents look rather mechanical compared to the construction of the letters.
Titles, periods, and commas look too slight. 
Ear of g looks a bit sad. 
Top right of U looks wimpy. Could proportions of N&rsquo;s serif work there?
Is the difference in width between f&rsquo;s hood and j&rsquo;s hook an issue? I&rsquo;m not sure.
I agree about shortening the descenders.</div>

Will take another look at the descenders on /j /p /q, maybe /y; OTOH I&rsquo;ve experimented with a shorter /g and didn&rsquo;t care for the result.</p>
<p>@eliason
Inclined to agree about the /U.  Possibly something between that and the /N serif.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right about the /g&rsquo;s ear - I&rsquo;ve never been really satisfied with it but haven&rsquo;t managed to come up with a better one yet.  Maybe it should simply be flared a little more.</p>
<p>The slant on the /5 is meant to loosely match the angle of /6 and /7 in the same region.</p>
<p>Good point about the baseline /f /r serif.  As far as the hook goes, I&rsquo;m not perfectly happy with either the /f&rsquo;s or the /j&rsquo;s, but I decided early on not to go with the &lsquo;inverted-f&rsquo; style /j.</p>
<p>I reduced the serif on /c and /r considerably in the last update, but I was admittedly less aggressive in doing the same to /C /G.  Will revisit.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

This is a text face (where individual glyph beauty needs to be tamed &ldquo;for the greater good&rdquo;) and the &ldquo;g&rdquo; happens to be exactly the glyph that needs to start looking a bit ungainly (due to being vertically cramped) for the font to be properly balanced (by not misusing the vertical space). Basically in a text font if the &ldquo;g&rdquo; is too beautiful more important things are going wrong.</p>
<p>Also: it&rsquo;s very rare for descenders to be at different depths (essentially for good reason) so whatever depth the &ldquo;g&rdquo; ends up at the others should (normally) follow.</p>

I think the new asterisk does a better job (I&rsquo;ve adjusted it some since the above was taken) but I&rsquo;m still basically relying on my eyes.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still something not quite right about the overall harmony but it&rsquo;s hard to say what.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really happy with the /a just yet.  I quite liked the earlier, wider form (seen in various posts above), but it didn&rsquo;t really fit in anymore with how I&rsquo;d redesigned everything else over time.  I think I&rsquo;ll try extending the top end a little more to the left, and maybe try reducing the bowl height some more.</p>
<p>I also can&rsquo;t quite shake the feeling that /b and /d are faintly off-balance, somehow&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the issue with the |U| is the bottom.  Try to down the curve, this will open the bottom. It also be enlarge to be between the H and the V. You will see after if you have to enlarge the |VWXY|. About the harmony I would say it&rsquo;s because some letters are too condensed. Compare the |s, g and u| to my point of view the |s| should be wider. For the |a| you could go up the left part of the top where the serif is, this will open the letter between the serif and the bowl. Keep going.</div>
