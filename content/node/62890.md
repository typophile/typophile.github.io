  body: 'Bembo is indeed an Aldine typeface.  But there are differences between these
    two fonts.  And for the purpose of type ID, the sample is more accurately described
    as Bembo.  I don''t mean to be a wanker, but in terms of <em>fonts</em>, Aldine
    401 is Aldine 401 and Bembo is Bembo.  '

  body: Aldine 401 is Bitstream's version of Bembo, but casiokid is right that this
    is Bembo set in small caps. Aldine 401 doesn't come in small caps. So, it's Bembo
    (small caps), and not Aldine 401.
