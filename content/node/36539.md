  all sorts of noise? I know some people have, lets just say, \"different\" opinions
  him, but he does have a knack for stirring up conversation. \r\n\r\nMaybe we should
  post our favorite Hrant moment in reflection?\r\n\r\n"

    very short, and I was offended! Hrant is elfophobic! And we should do something
    about it! \u2014ER\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nOne thing
    I'd say about hrant is I never got the feeling he was beating around the bush.
    I appreciate that. \r\n\r\nHe also never misinterpreted/misrepresented/blew out
    of proportion  anything I said.\r\n\r\nI miss him.\r\n\r\n\"BTW, my best line,
    when seeing them use three patrol cars and a helicopter to book a poor drunk sap:
    \u201CDo you **** think you have enough people here?\u201D Result: they followed
    me and gave me a ticket for a defective brake light (serves me right for exercising
    my free speech, gol\u2019dangit*), but it was so worth it: you can\u2019t BUY

  body: "Dan, I agree with Frederik's sentiment in the sense that talking about a
    person in a personal way on Typophile rather than about their work or their ideas
    or their comments can quickly become questionable. This thread does look a bit
    like an invitation to 'stir the pot' rather than an opportunity to further anybody's
    understanding. Do you disagree?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Fredrik, you could of
    course not contribute to the thread. I should note that it is not always possible
    to know who is around & who is not *for sure*. So intensive checking every time
    somebody has a comment isn't actually practical or reasonable. \r\n\r\nSo what
    I am saying is 'it's the content'. And 'please keep it civil dudes'.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    this:\r\nImagine Hrant coming back, logging into Typophile, and finding a nice
    thread that has an interesting collection of his sayings or ideas assembled into
    one nice little package. In a sense, the history of Hrant IS the history of Typophile
    (along side others as well.)\r\n\r\nAnd I don't know why I care, since I don't,
    but doesn't anyone else feel that a mature discussion can be had without people
    stepping in and saying \"Hey, you guys can't do that! You're gonna flame someone!\"
    or even worse, actually flaming someone? Now THAT is out of line.\r\n\r\nNo flamers
    allowed. Except James. But that's another topic altogether :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you must admit that when it comes to a gamut-encompassing passion, Stewf is no
    hrant. I think you need Armenian blood for that.\r\n; )\r\nBecause of that passion,
    hrant would be near the top of Typophilers I'd like to spend a day with. It would
    have to be interesting. Especially since he seems to take as good as he gives.

    people on Typophile to continue to do that for each other rather than spending
    time variously praising or criticizing an individual or each other. I can't make
    you do this of course, and moreover I doubt that Hrant would agree with me. Still,
