body: 'Hi &#40;sorry for my english, it&#39;s not good&#41; <BR> <BR>This is a logo
  that I designed for the company I work for &#40;the firts one&#41;. <BR>The name
  is Infivia, a weird name, but that&#39;s it. In french, you have the words in it
  : Infinite and via &#40;for the way, the road, a path&#41;. Anyway. I&#39;m really
  confuse because it&#39;s been 3 days that a realize that my boss choose a logo that
  I sell myself to them, but now I really think that it&#39;s not good, but they like
  it. I&#39;m trying a lot of ways, but it&#39;s very hard to make the logo for your
  company, when your boss don&#39;t know what they want. And I just want to make a
  good design.  <BR> <BR>I want to know if it&#39;s readable. If it&#39;s ok or if
  it&#39;s really bad. Or if you have ideas. Is the serif ok? The spaces are not good
  yet. <BR> <BR>We are a graphic design company in Montreal, we do documentaries posters,
  corpo things but funny things too. <BR>This is our website if you want to understand
  the company. <BR><a href="http://www.infivia.com" target="_blank">www.infivia.com</a>
  <BR>Thanks a lot , I really need help. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/57321.gif"

  body: Thank for both of you. <BR>Now, What about this one. <BR>I know that is more
    &#34;oldstyle&#34; but with an element, that it&#39;s not find from now, maybe
    it can be interesting. I like this one. <BR>Our company regroup young people by
    the way. Is it too old school? <BR>Some people told me that we should read anf
    feel what we are doing in the company... What do you think? <BR> <BR>Thanks very
    much again.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/57351.gif" alt="">

  body: I,m thinking about a symbol that representthe infinite. The mathematical symbol
    for infinite is interesting but there is already a lot of company that uses that.
    <BR>Suggestions?

  body: I like the idea of working an infity symbol into the logo &#62;&#62; have
    you tried modifying the f into a 45degree infitity loop? It may look awful or
    it may work.

  body: Yeah I thought about it but it&#39;s already exist in Montreal and it&#39;s
    a new branding. <BR>But what about a wing? Something more sketchy  for the infinite,
    a way, something light and that goes far. <BR>see the logo existing.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/57412.gif"

    Is there a vital reason to change?
