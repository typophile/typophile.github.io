<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Earlier this year, I picked up a book in New Orleans containing two Greek plays: <i>The Frogs</i> and <i>The Birds</i>. The former is set Fleischmann with a great all caps display type. The following is based on (not exactly) those letters. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35103.gif alt="Frogs sample"> <br> <br>I am looking to create a titling font with the fine lines of Bodoni or Didot, but more Baroque in flavor. I suppose the actual types could be a display version of Fleischmann. I'll post the printed sample when I get a chance. <br> <br>Thanks, <br>Addison</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, it looks more like something from Caslon maybe. A big difference in the book's font is that the serifs are flat, as well as the tops and bottoms of the "flat" glyphs (T, E, F). I chose to make them slightly concave. <br> <br>Here's the title page from the book: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35110.gif alt="title page"></div>

<div class=commentbody>I guess Juan actually means the opposite. <br>And I agree with him. 'T', for example, could be slightly narrower. <br>OTOH, 'H' is narrow, and its middle could be lower. <br>Anyway, it looks nice (although it reminds me of some 70s/ITC things too).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Addison, I'd have to check the Enschede specimen book I'm hoarding from the UCLA library (the stratospheric 1908 edition) if this is really based on something F'man did (it sort of feels like Rosart too, although much more refined). Please remind me on Monday. <br> <br>BTW, this is feeling more and more like Carter's Victoria&Albert font, a revival of which is now used by the LA Times for the section heads. <br> <br>About the widths: an all-caps font can have more ample widths for "lopsided" letters (like the "T"), because it's supposed to be spaced out a lot anyway. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Good point about the caps spacing, Hrant. <br>The uneven color in 'Courage', for example, can be solved by adjusting the sidebearings (and maybe using some kerning). <br> <br>What about making it lighter?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice illustration, Juan, I understand what you mean. I guess I'm still developing that sense of balance between the letterforms and the spaces between the letterforms. I don't use measurements all that much, perhaps I should... <br> <br>Hrant, I've made a note to remind you about the Fleischmann specimen. I can't believe you can get an Enschede specimen from a library--the bookstores here (Mississippi) don't know what a type specimen is... but we have the blues. Anyway... <br> <br>I need to get that Carter book, I'd like to see the V&A font as well. <br> <br>Eduardo, the spacing was done in the layout (actually slapped together) so it doesn't really reflect the sidebearings. The sidebearings really haven't been set yet--I still haven't finished all the letters. So maybe the spacing would solve the problem (or help)? <br> <br>Thanks, <br>Addison</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant makes a more valid point about it than I would have. However, I also think that at display sizes the words need to be narrower ... similar to better reading happens in shorter column widths. Also, narrower is more elegant.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'll be brave here and voice my opinion. (Gulp!) In this case, I like the broad letters--they have a bold, stately appearance that you couldn't knock over if you tried. In fact, that may have been one of the initial elements that appealed to me. Their forms and thick/thin relationships make them elegant. (I'm talking about the letters from the book, not mine.) <br> <br>In fact, I don't see this type being used for setting sentences or paragraphs. Titling may not be the right word, but I had assumed its purpose was for setting titles, two or three words and such.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Don't feel like you have to be brave Addison. (looking again at the letters at the top of this thread) I think this ... ok, any type design .. would be dead boring if it all followed the same so-called "norm". I do like these shapes. Perhaps I spoke too soon. But, in some display situations it is fun to be able to use it LARGE. If the letters are too wide it often won't work. That's all. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>Addison, I concur on the stately appearance the face has, especially that it's enhanced by the width of the seifs and the letters as a whole. Wide letters enable you to use looser tracking for heightened drama without looking too late-90s. <br> <br>You could always do a supplementary condensed titling face if you felt the need for one.</div>

<div class=commentbody>To be more complete, my classe did a Rosart couple years ago, in four optical sizes. Note the smaller caps sizes in the Rosart 1. Indeed the Rosart 2 and 3 are interpolated but in fact follow quite precisely the original sizes cut at the time, who confirm Summer Stone assertion when they have done ITC Bodoni in similar way. <br> <br><a href=http://perso.ensad.fr/%7eensadtypo/fontes.html#rosart target=_blank>http://perso.ensad.fr/%7eensadtypo/fontes.html#rosart</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>JF: pretty nice. <br>Question: how do you get multiple designers to work on one font? Collaborative type design has always seemed tricky - do you separate the tasks, or the glyphs, or what? <br> <br>Addison: If you're worried about duplicating the work of JF's students (although it doesn't seem finished - not that that should have been the point of the class), you might consider making your version more idiosyncratic (either by replicating the funkiness in the original Rosart fonts or maybe even by putting in your own). Another option though would be to make a "clean" font but <i>inspired</i> by Rosart, instead of a revival. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

You can't tell too well in the posted scan, but the faint circling of certain letters indicates Dwiggins's best guess at which particular instances Griffith enlarged for him.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Kent. ;) I'm sure my dissertation talks about it somewhat, I was just too lazy to open it up. <br> <br>re WIDE V. NARROW -- Sometimes, I notice people using the small caps of typefaces as the display. They must agree that wide is more stately. I'll go out on a limb and just say that in a sans wide can be nice. But for a serif, especially something that is supposed to evoke elegance, I find typefaces on the narrow (not condensed) side to be more elegant. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>About the width of capitals, I believe that for a titling face there is often more variation in width than in caps made with an eye to lower case. Personally, I think it is more elegant to have not uniformity in wide or narrow, but the variation, such as in Forum caps or Zapf's Michelangelo titling face. <br> <br>I suspect that small caps may often work better for titling because they are designed and spaced for all caps setting, as opposed to regular caps, which are done with an eye to the harmony with the lower case. I am just guessing, and I'd be interested in hearing from those knowledgeable about this. <br> <br>Jonathan Hoefler discusses the tension between the two goals for caps in an interesting interview at daidala.com. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>William, your first paragraph is very true and agree with it. Caps designed alone ar not spaced same way.

<div class=commentbody>JF, thanks once more. Your method seems pretty optimal. <br> <br>> I think it is more elegant to have not uniformity <br> <br>It's also better for reading. <br> <br>The one interesting thing I've discovered about caps is that you have to let them be their own alphabet (for better or worse): you simply can't make them harmonize with the lc too much (unless it's a funky font).

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, JFP, for your correction and clarification. I have been using Minion SC for subtitles in a project I am working on, and found it worked better than the caps, but that is not actually a title, and there probably the smoothness of the small caps setting helps. I will look at this and check where I am using caps vs small caps with a better awarenes of the difference. <br> <br>But I guess for Addison, who wants to work on an all-caps titling face the point holds: he would best be guided by looking at other titling faces, or compare those faces which have both regular and titling caps. </div>

<div class=commentbody>(I just had a strange deja vue when I read the second page...) <br> <br>Very classy stuff. <br> <br>I think the outside serifs on the "C", "G" (on top) and "S" need more length. <br>I'm not sure about the "J" - try a serify terminal. <br>The leg of the "K" feels cramped on the inside - maybe try a descending form? <br>Give the "L" a wider base (look at the "T", and remember the all-caps factor). <br>I would flare the "M". <br>I would make the head of the "P" slightly larger. Maybe. <br>The tail of the "Q" seems to flow too much into the body on the left. More juice, please. <br>The "Y" seems to need a heftier top. <br>The tips of the "Z" (and "N" at the bottom too) seem to need more flourish. <br> <br>This is already looking really pro, Addison - an improvement even on Rosart. <br>I wonder about the name, though; what about "Aristo"? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>As always, thanks for your help, Hrant--I'm taking notes. And I like "Aristo" very much. "Frogs" is kind of blah, isn't it? <br> <br>BTW, if I'm going to consider ligatures, will the loose spacing become an issue? <br> <br>-Addison</div>

<div class=commentbody>I prefer Frogs over Ariso, but how about <a href="http://colet.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/chuck/woodhouse_pages.pl?page_num=346" target=_blank> Batrakhos</a> (that is if i read the Greek correctly)</div>

<div class=commentbody>> if I'm going to consider ligatures, will the loose spacing become an issue? <br> <br>Oh yeah. <br>The best you can do is choose a target tightness (which will of course be your default spacing), make the ligatures accordingly, and hope the font user doesn't mess up! :-/ But I guess you could make loose and tight sets too. Huh, nice idea, if I do say so myself! :-> <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Frogs is back after much polishing. The changes are very subtle and, unfortunately, include no ligatures. I did my best to tighten up everything I have so far as much as possible--and this was accomplished with some much appreciated help. I'm going to keep things pretty straight-forward for now, and learn as much as possible. Please let me know what you think. <br> <br>Thanks, <br>Addison <br> <br>PS: The name is still up in the air, but it's Frogs for now. <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Frogs Specimen<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Frogs_Specimen_3-37851.pdf target=_blank><b>Frogs Specimen 3.pdf</b></a> (14.6 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>The PDF is working fine here. <br> <br>And the 'face looks good too. I just think that the treatment of the J's tail doesn't fit. And the K, there's something strange about it. I think it's the leg. And the wordspace could be slightly narrower.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, I tried creating a new PDF this morning, but Windows XP isn't cooperating. I'll get back on my Mac and post something as soon as I can. <br> <br>Eduardo, thanks for the positive feedback. I like the J myself, but I may try a different treatment--sometimes things look alright until you change them. Then they look better! The K is probably the strangest glyph to me, but I've tinkered with it constantly. Any suggestions? <br> <br>-Addison</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's not that the J doesn't look good. It does, I just think it doesn't belong to this typeface. <br>I guess it's too 'cute', I don't know. <br> <br>About the K, what about trying something more like <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/caslon/540/win-t1/140376/character/004B/CP2/1/> Caslon 540</a>? <br>I'm thinking about the way the three strokes should meet each other (or not).</div>
