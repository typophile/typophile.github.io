body: "Hello all, Im looking for a font called \"Benjamin Cap\". I cant find it anywhere,
  it seems to be a popular wedding invitation font. I keep finding a different cursive
  like Benjamin, but not the one I am in need of (image underneath is of the correct
  font). Can anyone point me to a place that offers this one?      \r\nThank you,\r\nFidel[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Or4304_6632.2_inv.jpg]"
