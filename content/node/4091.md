  body: Right on the nose. <BR> <BR>The word not only looks like &#34;dam,&#34; it
    sounds just like it, too. Maybe it was a glitch. <BR> <BR>Anyone know about the
    roughness of those worn areas of Federal? I&#39;d be more inclined to get it if
    I knew that those areas look more organic in the real deal.

    discontinuity &#40;where the horizontal stroke meets the left curve stroke&#41;.
    My first guess was Lanston Bodoni 26... so I went to Lanston&#39;s website, looked
    at the PDF and posted the answer. Why? :-&#41; <BR> <BR>New quiz tomorrow.
