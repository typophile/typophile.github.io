  me on it? please. It looks like a Time New Roman but, it's not exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: 'It doesn''t fit, metrically, any version of Times I''m familiar with. Not
    only that, the stroke weights are completely wrong from a design standpoint. The
    braces and the /I may be from a font but I believe the /A, /M and /X are either
    hand-drawn or have been extensively modified. '
