body: "Recently I have built Opentype Mongolian font.\r\nMongolian is a vertical script
  and practically same as Arabic in Opentype sense.\r\n(Required features are isol,
  init, medi, fina, calt, rlig)\r\nAlthough it works on InDesign, it doesn't on other
  apps like OpenOffice, which supports Arabic.\r\nIn that case, what you get is a
  non-connected characters even without positional replacement.\r\nAlso I'm trying
  to see it work on web browsers but likewise they don't recognise the features mentioned
  above (typical fi ligatures are functioning), which seems strange because Opentype
  Arabic fonts are working alright. (Am I actually testing it with those with AAT
  tables? I don't know.)\r\n\r\n\u2014 Safari Loads my local font. Recognises liga,
  but not kern, onum, smcp, and Mongolian features (but it does for Arabic). It doesn't
  recognise CSS3 vertical writing mode.\r\n\u2014 Webkit Nightly Build does vertical
  setting correctly. Other behaviour is quite the same as Safari.\r\n\u2014 Chrome
  behaves the same as Webkit Nightly Build.\r\n\u2014 Firefox doesn't load my font
  (should I write the CSS code differently?), however, it applies wider variety of
  Opentype features than above browsers.\r\n\u2014 Opera sucks.\r\n\r\nI don't think
  the reason is that those unfunctional apps don't support Mongolian script as InDesign
  works.\r\n\r\nCan anybody tell me what could be wrong?"
