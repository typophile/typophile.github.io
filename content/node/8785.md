body: So I made a font with liga, smcp, onum, pnum, and tnum. All very basic. I generated
  the font. I started laying out pages in InDesign to see if it was ready. Everything
  worked fine. But I thought the metrics weren&#39;t quite right so I adjusted them
  in the .vfb file, removed the .otf and regenerated the font. Many tries later &#40;including
  rewriting the features and rebuilding the classes&#41; I still can&#39;t get the
  features to work in Indesign. In fact, they are unavailable. What am I doing wrong?

  body: Yes, yes, and no, I&#39;m using a PC. This is getting really frustrating.
    They look fine in the preview window, the imported otf has the features present,
    but still, InDesign won&#39;t admit it. Arrrgh. Fool that I am, I don&#39;t have
    the functioning version of the font anymore.

  body: Sounds like you did everything right -- that is frustrating. <BR> <BR>It feels
    like InDesign can&#39;t find the correct font. I&#39;m no InDesign expert; there
    are several ways to get it to &#34;see&#34; a font. I&#39;ve always used ATM to
    remove &amp; install fonts to the system when playing w/ InDesign. Did you do
    it that way?

  body: OK. I opened the otf file, changed all the file info so that the font is now
    identified as &#34;frustrated&#34;, checked the features, made certain they were
    compiled, and generated the font. Then I removed all the AdobeFn&#42;.lst files,
    deactivated and removed the problem font and installed the new font. InDesign
    still refuses to recognize the features. I&#39;m going to try to use it on another
    machine.

  body: I am going mad... Nothing I do works. I made a font with two glyphs. A triangle
    at the &#39;a&#39; and a square. I set up two classes with the &#39;a&#39; in
    the first and the square in the second, added a smcp feature that when active
    substituted the second class for the first, generated the font, and it worked
    fine in InDesign CS. Anyone want to take a look at my .vfb and or the otf file
    for the real font that I&#39;m trying to work on and tell me what I&#39;ve managed
    to do wrong? contact me,  <BR>my first initial last name @ gmail.com

  body: Noah,  <BR> <BR>if your actual font works fine on one computer but doesn&#39;t
    on another, then it&#39;s a clear indication that something&#39;s wrong with one
    of the computers &#40;system, InDesign installation etc.&#41; rather than the
    font.  <BR> <BR>If you presume that something is wrong with the font, and you&#39;re
    using FontLab, why don&#39;t you contact FontLab tech support at the usual location&#42;?
    You paid for the software, you&#39;re eligible to receive free tech support. We&#39;re

  body: I am convinced that it is a problem in InDesign, not FontLab, but it is possibly
    a problem in this font. InDesign 2 and CS are very different in how they handle
    this stuff. I&#39;m going to contact Adobe first and if they don&#39;t have any
    ideas I&#39;ll contact FontLab directly. I have a natural inclination to want
    to solve problems without tech support and use them as a last resort, an irrational
    bias, I know.

  body: Noah, <BR> <BR>I had a similar problem, but with Word, not InDesign.  I made
    changes to a font which were ignored by Word.  The solution turned out to be deleting
    the font from Windows, rebooting, then reinstalling the font.  This was a standard
    TTF, not an OTF; but it might work.  Just my 2 cents. <BR> <BR>David

  body: Are you using different versions of InDesign on the two different machines?
    <BR> <BR>Can you be more specific about how ID2 and IDCS differ in your experience?
    This sort of substitution I would not expect to behave in any way differently
    in the two app versions. <BR> <BR>In general, I am inclined to agree with Adam
    that, in this area of font functionality, if the font works correctly on one of
    the two computers, the problem probably lies outside the font. &#40;There are
    some other areas where I would not bet on this, like whether and how fonts appear
    in application menus, but that&#39;s another story.&#41; <BR> <BR>Oh, and it&#39;s
    probably not necessary to &#34;contact Adobe&#34; seeing as I&#39;m here. Besides
    being the PM responsible for fonts, I&#39;m also the PM responsible for Core Tech

  body: Wild thought -- long ago, there was a problem with &#34;font caching&#34;,
    wherein some RIP&#39;s would cache the font by the font&#39;s ID number. Strange
    things could happen . . . which led me to both rename all my fonts &#40;Bembo
    is B0500000&#41; AND to set the font ID number to &#34;0&#34; &#40;zero&#41; in
    Fontographer. This let Fontographer write off the font with the font ID number
    as a comment line. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t find a similar place to comment out the
    font ID number in FontLab 4.6.  <BR> <BR>Charles

    But it&#39;s on screen, right? No Adobe applications are using the UniqueID &#40;nor
    its successor, the XUID&#41; for any such purpose. <BR> <BR>Adobe itself no longer
    uses these, and omits them entirely in new fonts. You can just leave them blank
    in FontLab. They&#39;re in the first set of stuff under &#34;Version and Identification&#34;
    in the Font Info dialog. <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Thomas: <BR>My experience of the differences between InD2 and InDCS are that
    the latter is less prone to crashing, feels faster, and is more intuitive to use.
    My assumption is that the underlying technology is very different from that found
    in earlier versions, different enough that I would not be surprised if they share
    less than 50% of their code. At anyrate, the continued lack of backwards compatibility
    and adobe&#39;s failure to provide the promised plugin coupled with their recommended
    solution of using xml as the interchange format suggests that there are differences
    in how things are handled. Big ones. Additionally, InD2 has no problem with the
    font while InDCS does. What I&#39;ve heard is that InDCS bypasses most of the
    OS level font handling, though I don&#39;t know if this is only for Macs. <BR>
    <BR>Since I doubt someone such as yourself would have any desire to steal the
    unfinished font of a novice &#40;this goes for anyone on this board&#41; if you
    have InDCS handy and are willing to test the font at least then I will be certain
    that it is something specific to my machine.'

  body: The underlying technology in ID2 and IDCS is essentially the same. In areas
    that are present in both, the composition engine was revised, and plenty of bugs
    were fixed, and performance was improved, but the overwhelming majority of the
    code that was in ID2 continued into IDCS. <BR> <BR>Both versions bypass substantial
    aspects of the OS level font handling, though both rely on the OS for some of
    that &#40;like enumerating fonts installed at the system level, and on the Mac
    enumerating the primary script supported by the font&#41;. You might see more
    bypassing the OS in the future, as we continue to contend with OS-level bugs.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to continue to be pretty swamped this week, but if nobody
    else takes a look at it before then, I&#39;d be happy to look at your font next
    week. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Cool, with any luck I&#39;ll have figured it out for myself by then, but if
    not I&#39;d really appricate it. I&#39;m 99% certain it isn&#39;t the font, but
    I just reinstalled InDesign after wiping every trace of it from the registry as
    well as all files it left behind after the uninstall and none of the versions
    of the font work with it, but they all work on my old machine.
