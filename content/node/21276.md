body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm new to font-making, and I've been pulling my hair out trying
  to get some OpenType features working for a Cyrillic font I'm putting together.
  Superscript variants and ligatures *are* supposed to work in Word 2003, right? (I
  did try InDesign too, also with no luck.)\r\n\r\nMy font needs superscript glyphs
  that look somewhat different than just a raised standard glyph. If it makes a difference,
  the superscript glyphs have dimensions such that they should show up above the previous
  character.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the superscript glyphs take on a different appearance
  if combined with Uni0483 (combining titlo); they should still appear above the previous
  character.\r\n\r\nI've read everything I can on OpenType superscripts and looked
  at all the fonts I have for clues, but I wasn't able to find much in terms of examples.
  All I know is that typing any of the relevant characters in superscript doesn't
  yield the superscript variants, and none of the ligatures appear when the correct
  combinations are typed.\r\n\r\nHere's what I did for the OpenType code:\r\n\r\nfeature
  sups { # Superscript\r\n script cyri;\r\n    sub [uni0434 uni043C uni0440 uni0441]
  by [uni0434.sups uni043C.sups uni0440.sups uni0441.sups];\r\n} sups;\r\n\r\nand
  also\r\n\r\nfeature liga { # Standard Ligatures\r\n script cyri;\r\n    sub uni0434
  uni0483 by uni0434_uni0483.sups;\r\n    sub uni043C uni0483 by uni043c_uni0483.sups;\r\n
  \   sub uni0440 uni0483 by uni0440_uni0483.sups;\r\n    sub uni0441 uni0483 by uni0441_uni0483.sups;\r\n}
  liga;\r\n\r\nAny help at all would be wonderful.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n~Quinn"

    copy your lookups to to the default script so for your superscript feature it
    should look something like:\r\n\r\nfeature sups { # Superscript\r\nlookup sups1

    i've gotten anything wrong, Adam should show up shortly to straighten you out.

    for thinks like super/subscripts and smallcaps."

  body: "Thanks for fixing that-- I really appreciate it. Disappointing news about
    Word, though. Do you know where I could find a list of programs that do support
    OpenType features? (And whether Word for Vista will?) I'm assuming browsers don't
    display it. I'd ideally like to use them in xml-based e-books, but it would be
    up to the e-book reader software to support it, right?\r\n\r\nAlso, if someone
    writes something with the correct combinations for the superscript or ligature
    in Word, then copies and pastes it into a program that does support OpenType,
    will the variant glyphs show up?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nQuinn"

  body: "Typotheque has a list of applications that support OpenType features:\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support/\r\nBut
    read with caution:\r\nFor some features in XPress7, the mark only means that the
    according glyphs can be accessed by way the glyph palette (this is: 'ornaments',
    'historical forms', 'slashed zero', 'stylistic alternates').\r\nAnd that almost
    all features are marked in the Microsoft Avalon column does NOT mean that any
    application actually support them. As it seems, Word for Vista does not (there
    was a thread on this topic)."

  body: Re. Avalon aka WPF. It's is a development platform that is still in beta.
    Almost all the registered OT features are supported via a simple mark-up language
    XAML - however as the platform is new there are no notable apps using it yet.

    page, maybe too much information on it, but at least you can download and install
    WPF from there: \r\n<a> http://msdn.microsoft.com/winfx/reference/presentation/default.aspx</a>\r\n\r\nWPF
    Text team has a blog with useful information about text formatting:\r\n<a>http://blogs.msdn.com/text/default.aspx</a>\r\n\r\nFilipe
    Fortes is another guy working in WPF text layout team and has a nice blog with
