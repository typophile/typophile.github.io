  body: It is a Windows-only font. If it were .ttf it would be usable but as it is,
    no.

  body: That's good to know about; I'll have to give it a try, although I wonder how
    well the Windows encoding in the .pfb fonts will integrate. I think that might
    cause problems if the file went to someone else.

    fonts travel a lot these days. Even the old ones. ;-)\r\nIs that a freeware font
    or a custom corporate font or why was it just \u201Cgiven to you\u201D?\r\n\r\nAs
    already mentioned, Type1 fonts are not platform-compatible. You can't install
    a Mac Type1 on Windows and you cannot install a Win Type1 on the Mac. They can
    be converted to .otf of the license permits it. \r\n"

    OS (X) can\u2019t understand it, but Adobe of course knows its own font format
    and just continues to support it internally. If the fonts are placed in certain
    font folders, apps like InDesign will check those folders and then just make those
    fonts available as if they were installed. After all, Type1 was a rather simple
    font format. ;-)\r\nNote this works only for PC Type1 on the Mac. I can't work
    the other way around, because of the way the Mac Type1 fonts were stored in the
    resource fork of the file. "

    the early days of Adobe Acrobat Reader, under operating systems like Windows 95
    and 98,  Multiple Master Type 1  fonts were included in the package (used primarily
    for rendering) and you DID NOT NEED Adobe Type Manager ATM).'

    fonts just fine.\r\n\r\nT"
