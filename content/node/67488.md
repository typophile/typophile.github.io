  on a revival of a very interesting bold condensed Clarendon that I believe was made
  by a French foundry.\r\n\r\nI've found a complete uppercase sample, and have finished
  the rest of the font in a similar style. For accuracy's sake, I would love to find
  an example of the lowercase or numbers.\r\n\r\nThe type has markings: AUDERBAUD
  BRESSURE (2 SEVRES) \r\nAnyone have any insight on this or know what it means? \r\n\r\nIt
  would be nice to see if anyone has any other information on this particular font
  or the history of French wood type in general.\r\nI know Clarendon was an English
  design, and this French one is a copy, but it is unique and I haven't seen one like
  it in all my years of type catalog absorbing.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatt"

  body: "Perhaps you have already found this reference, but a fine set of very French
    slab-serif wood letter capitals has just been sold by an English vendor on Ebay
    with exactly this marking. Googling should bring up the record, with a good image.
    \u2018Bressure\u2019 does not seem to be recorded as a place name, but it may
    be an alternative spelling for Bressuire, which is in the D\xE9partement of Deux-S\xE8vres
    and has a municipal web site with various links, including one for the regional
    archives. They may be able to tell you if there was a wood-type maker there, \u2018fabricant
    de caract\xE8res en bois\u2019 or something of the kind. (That\u2019s what I should
    call it. A \u2018foundry\u2019 made metal type, and there\u2019s nothing wrong
    with extending the term to modern makers of digital fonts, but to me it sounds
    wrong to apply it to a manufacturer using a technique that was quite different
    from casting metal \u2013 although a few of the big typefoundries did make, or
    at least sell, wood types bearing their names.) \r\n\r\nI have tried the union
    catalogue of French libraries and can't find anything under \u2018Auderbaud\u2019
    so perhaps nobody has kept their specimens. But I hope I'm wrong, and the municipal
    archives or library at Bressuire might be a place to start looking. Nor do I know
    of a study of the making wood type in France. If one doesn't exist, this may be
    the time to begin."

    \u2013 hadn't seen your post. But the reference in Ebay does also have \u2018Auderbaud\u2019
    so presumably this was on the type. There are several Audebauds listed as authors
    in the French union catalogue, including one writing about a part of France that
    is not far away, so maybe it\u2019s a regional name. But alas no type specimens
    under this name."

    without a title, one of which was issued by Constant Audebaud, G. Chauvin and
    Louis Moreau, and the printer at Tours was the Imprimerie E. Arrault et Cie, 1886.
