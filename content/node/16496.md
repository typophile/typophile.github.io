    know what it is, though. Stuart''s Cocktail Shaker is similar.'

  body: "Are you joking? I think it is an old display font... Ah, yes. Here it is
    on page 105 of the Solotype catalog: Japan Script. There is probably a digital
    version of it somewhere under some other name but, as is too often the case, I
    am not aware of it.\r\n\r\nEdit: Sorry, Chris. I thought you were referring to
    the script."

  body: 'I think I found the other one, too: If you have a copy of the book <em>Alphabets
    & Other Signs,</em> edited by Julian Rothenstein and Mel Gooding, check out the
    constructed alphabet on page 105 made from brass rules. Except for the v and a
    small modification on the first a, it''s a very good match.'

  body: there's a freeware font called Stereo that matches the hotel text pretty close,
    and Chank's Liquorstore can easily be adjusted for the first part

  body: '"ABZ: More Alphabets & Other Signs," by the same authors, is one of my favorite
    type books. My fantasy career as a type designer often starts with that constructed
    alphabet as a training exercise. Then I knock out a few of the modular faces Leslie
    Cabarga illustrates in his "Logo, Font & Lettering Bible" right as a wave of early
    ''90s nostalgia crests, which I ride to fame and riches. ;)'

  body: "According to the author of the logo:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe logotype is custom
    and was inspired by two typefaces. The letterforms in Avalon are based on sketches
    that Paul Renner did for an alternate version of Futura. Hotel is set in Japan
    Script which was digitized from the Solotype archive.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo it's not
    my Kg Stuttgart :)"
