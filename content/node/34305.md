  body: "It's a very clean approach and it's definitely better than the original,
    but it's stil a bit bland. Are you going to incorporate any other colors or textures?
    At least use a richer/darker green something closer to a tyipcal Forest Green
    for the \"Green Fields\" type. \r\n\r\nI do like the hill and tree illustration,
    but the sun and clouds looks too childish and unrealistic. I'm not sure the sun
    actually has straight lines shooting out of it. I'm visualizing something with
    a lot more  color (yellows>oranges>reds) and maybe even a gradient or two. \r\n\r\nAnd
    the lower case co. next to the all caps ARTS doesn't seem right. either use all
    caps or all lower case. "

    a few shades of green could help add some depth. For instance using a darker,
    richer green for the type and filling the white area possibly with the more yellow
    green you are using for the time now.\r\n\r\nI also agree about the \"ARTS co.\"
    area. It feels a bit like an after thought in how the type was handled (not to
    mean offense, just that it seems very much as if it were the last bit you added).
    I think all lower case may help.\r\n\r\nOverall I think it is worlds better than
    the original (which for some reason seems NASCAR-esque to me (slanted type and
    color bars probably)\r\n\r\n... _._. ... .. ... __.. ..._ ..."

    and that the color palette would be very vibrant. Like this. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/colors_3911.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    comments that the logo was too childish made me worry. My friend is selling mostly
    glass art. Glass art being...mostly pipes and bongs and that sort of thing. Not
    art supplies for kids. SO I will be completely reworking his logo again. Again
    retaining the sun thing he has going on and wants to keep. But making it a lot
    more crunchy granola (this is Austin after all) and less like a scene in a children's
    book."

    I think original logo's graphic elements (ignoring the type) were more suitable.
    The new logo (mainly because of the dominant type and choice of font) looks more
    appropriate for a landscape gardener.\r\n\r\nIf it is for a head shop then there's
    a whole world of  Summer of Love and psychedelic graphic styles and fonts you

  body: "It seems like the creator of the website needs to do a lot more thinking
    about the purpose and organization of the website before any real decisions are
    made about the logo. The intent of the site is unclear to me. Is it a site for
    online artist portfolios? The domain name contributes to the confusion, and the
    lack of a descriptive tagline perpetuates it.\r\n\r\nThe current logo looks like
    a lawncare business and it doesn't scale well. The thin lines would drop out if
    it were scaled down to fit on a business card. It also looks very dated. The initial
    \"improvements\" you posted suffer from the same 1970s look, as well as the inability
    to scale. Adding more colors created a new problem: lack of contrast.\r\n\r\nThe
    next round of revisions is a lot more fun to look at, but the logo still doesn't
    give an indication of what the site is about. \"Arts\" doesn't seem descriptive
    enough to me. If it were me, I would give up trying to include the hills and the
    sun, and concentrate on using the logo to convey the purpose of the site. With
    that in mind, I would first scrap the domain name and replace it with something
    that says art instead of agriculture."

    examples (in the coloured ones, I really missed the yellow to make things more

    I'm not too sure about the orange... The 2nd one of the new series with white
    outlines (the one with the darkgreen part for \"Arts co.\") seems to have it all.
    No need for yellow in this case, 'cause the white brightens it up a bit & the
    overall design is funky enough on its own.\r\nNice job!"

    the reference to \"Green.\" Fields is his last name. Pay no attention to its online
    presence, that will be replaced to reflect the merch in his store which is mostly
    glass pipes. He's going to sell his own artwork in the store as well. I tried
    to talk him out of the name (mostly because it doesn't roll off the tongue) but
    it's not something he's wiling to consider. \r\n\r\nHe also doesn't want to lose
    the sun. I may do some more treatments with a different version. "
