  typeface, who knows.\r\n\r\n\"munchilo\" was the nicest sounding pangram (of those
  letters I've already drawn) I could come up with. Googling it yields some 1,000
  hits, mostly German related. Anyone has any idea what it could mean?\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure I'm happy with the c, by the way.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to share your
  thoughts!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/munchilo_3896.jpg]"

  body: Has a nice feel. The c is lacking the flow the other characters have. Its
    stem is too straight and upright. Reminds me of my own Finnegan typeface. Go on!

  body: "I think the 'o' has an axis more vertical than the rest of the characters.\r\n\r\nI
    like the general look and subtle details in the strokes.\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "J Weltin,\r\n\r\nI feel the same about the /c/. I think I've managed to get
    it better now, but I need to let it cool before I can really judge. I hope to
    update soon.\r\n\r\nRamiroE,\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I agree, or should I say I'm
    not sure that's a problem, but to test your comment I've created an alternative
    /o/, and now I like both and can't pick one over the other... :`)"
