body: "I am using a FontFont opentype typeface, which by default contains oldstyle
  numbers. I require the use of lining numbers. Unfortunately the difficult part is
  that I am using the typeface in an old fashioned labelling software. Is there anyway
  I can reproduce the lining numbers in this software?\r\n\r\nFor example, I have
  accessed the opentype features in My design software and tried to copy and paste
  the numbers I need into the labelling software, but it doesn,t allow this. I have
  also tried looking through all the glyphs both in the software and in character
  map (Windows). I can find the lining numbers in the software  but the oldstyle numbers
  and the lining numbers have the same code, so when I hold down ALT+0051 I still
  only get the the oldstyle number. Is there any way around this?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nAndy"

  body: It's kind of relevant to mention the actual software you are using. If it
    does not contain any OpenType controls, and the font defaults to the wrong kind
    of numbers, then then the only option left is to physically edit the font (which
    may or may not be allowed).

    new font.)
