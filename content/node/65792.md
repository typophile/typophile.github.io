  word \u0547\u0576\u0578\u0580\u0570\u0561\u0582\u0578\u0580 means \"congratulations\"
  and is used for well-wishing in the New Year. And the first letter of \u0547\u0576\u0578\u0580\u0570\u0561\u0582\u0578\u0580,
  in its lowercase form, looks just like the numeral 2! So of course I couldn't resist.
  The one thing I'm wondering: is it really possible that a gradient can actually
  be useful, maybe once in a... decade?  :-)\r\n\r\nHappy New Year to all.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
