body: "You have been requesting a comparative review of Mercury and Farnham in Bald
  Condensed, and I am happy to announce I will be able to offer twice the fun. <a
  href=\"http://www.typography.com/\" target=\"new\">Hoefler & Frere-Jones</a>' <a
  href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/mercurydisplay/index.html\" target=\"new\">Mercury</a>
  will be compared not only to <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/people/ChristianSchwartz\"
  target=\"new\">Christian Schwartz</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Farnham\"
  target=\"new\">Farnham</a>, but to <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/people/MatthewCarter\"
  target=\"new\">Matthew Carter</a>'s Fenway -- the type family he designed as a replacement
  for Times Roman in Sports Illustrated -- and <a href=\"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Kaiser.html\"
  target=\"new\">Erhard Kaiser's</a> <a href=\"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/FleischmannDRegular.html\"
  target=\"new\">DTL Fleischmann</a> as well. Funny thing is that DTL Fleischmann
  -- which is the odd one out as it is the most faithful (and quirky) digitisation
  -- unexpectedly has a new competitor in <a href=\"http://www.secretonix.pt/ftf/index.html\"
  target=\"new\">M\xE1rio Feliciano</a>'s as of yet unreleased Eudald. This is a Didone
  which is based on the work of Eudald Pradell, a Spanish imitator of Fleischmann.
  So five typefaces in total will contend for the coveted title of <em>Most Totally
  Awesome Fleischmann Digitisation\u2122</em>.\r\n\r\nOh, one more thing: I would
  like to stress that I have no academic background whatsoever, so don't expect any
  roaring theories nor historical contexts. I review type from a gut feeling and using
  common sense. So if I get it wrong, please feel free to laugh at my expense. Like,
  really hard."

  body: Yeah! Looking forward to the review. I'm kinda disappointed Mercury does not
    come with OSF. Am I the only one?
