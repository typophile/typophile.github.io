  body: Hi Colin. I&#39;m renting a car with a couple of my students and driving from
    Chicago. If you could get somewhat nearer to Chicago than Providence :-&#41; we
    could pick you up, I&#39;m sure. We&#39;ll probably be leaving Thursday evening
    after my class.

    Put in $150 &#40;roughly the  <BR>price of gas from RI to MN, roundtrip I&#39;d
    guess.&#41; You never  <BR>know until you try... you could win the priceline lotto.
