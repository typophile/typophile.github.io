  body: "Nice little discussion on Flickr. The first second I saw the picture the
    /A was a bit obtrusive to me because I noticed how it goes against traditional
    stroke contrast. A second later I thought it was brilliant.\r\n\r\nIt's not that
    the left side is consistently dark though; the /Y is reversed. That actually does
    bother me a bit. A regular capital /Y with a vertical stem might have worked better.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not as convinced by the lowercase letters but the capital letters look pretty
    awesome."
