  intimate feeling one receives from getting a letter in the mail, verses receiving
  an email in their inbox... I am working on solving this problem typographically
  and have looked at numerous script typefaces, such as work by Jill Bell, Hermann
  Zapf, the typeface Dalliance along with many others. And I ask: What makes a good
  &#34;handwritten&#34; face?  <BR> <BR>And: What kind of application could give the
  same effort, care, love &amp; time that is put into a handwritten letter?  <BR>
  <BR>I have a couple of ideas, but I haven&#39;t hit the lightbulb, any help would
  be appreciated. Thanks!  <BR> <BR>jessie'

  body: On an handwritten letter, you have not only the forms of the letters used,
    but the texture, the color, the size, the smell, the noise from the paper, you
    have also the envelop you need to open, you have the stamps, in fact, many many
    small details who can&#39;t be compared to a perfect screen of a computer. <BR>
    <BR>So, its not Zapfino who will solve alone the problem. Sadly... <BR>

  body: 'I think the central problem is essentially insurmountable.  :-&#40; <BR>
    <BR>The &#34;warmth&#34; from handwriting I think comes from two things: <BR>1&#41;
    Handwriting -especially handwriting that&#39;s read by <i>others</i>- is getting
    rarer, and this creates an aura of value. <BR>2&#41; It&#39;s different for every
    person writing. <BR> <BR>I guess #1 could theoretically be overcome by using a
    font that&#39;s so variable that the reader can&#39;t tell it&#39;s type. Problems
    with this: <BR>- It&#39;s technically very difficult. The Letterror twins have
    done some work in this direction, but as seminal as it is it&#39;s not the real
    thing. <BR>- It&#39;s very hard to tell if it&#39;s working or not, because of
    the difference between conscious deliberation versus our subconscious &#34;firmware&#34;.
    Merely asking a reader if he thinks it&#39;s handwriting or type doesn&#39;t cut
    it. <BR> <BR>As for #2, it&#39;s much much trickier! How do you make a font vary
    -convincingly- for each person? For one thing, no current &#40;or past&#41; font
    technology [I know of] supports such variance. But even if it did, the hypercomplex
    code would have to be written. I actually know [of] only one person doing something
    like this: Vlad Atanasiu, who recently finished a PhD dissertation on the quatification
    of Arabic calligraphy. His work is jaw-dropping, and makes even Tomas Milo&#39;s
    herculean efforts in making Arabic type look authentic seem oversimple. BTW, it&#39;s
    interesting that even though Latin is much more widespread and the west generally
    engages in quantification more than anybody else, nobody has tried to do for Latin
    what Atanasiu and Milo are doing for Arabic, at least not at all convincingly.
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>The thing is, why do you want to do this? Certainly &#34;warmth&#34;
    is generally a good thing to convey, I agree. But in terms of emulating handwriting,
    since it&#39;s technically so difficult, and I&#39;d say essentially anti-typographic,
    maybe there&#39;s another way to convey warmth in type? I would have to admit
    that it&#39;s much harder, or at least a lot less obvious. But maybe the qualitatively
    greater capacity of type to express abstraction can be used to convey a warmth
    of universalities, as opposed to individualities? Dunno. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Both of your answers are sort of what I expected, I thought, maybe, just maybe,
    I was over looking something.  <BR> <BR>When it comes to looking at the work of
    Vlad Atanasiu is there any out right now that is not in french?? or is his studies
    that recent?? In a nutshell what is it that makes his work so much more authentic
    than Thomas Milo&#39;s?? Is it simply making &#34;the eye think it&#39;s written?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>And to go off of the feeling of &#34;warmth&#34; in a handwritten letter,
    do you think it is the familarity of someone elses handwritting that conveys that
    for a person? Or is it all of the idiosyncrasy? <BR> <BR>??? <BR>jessie

  body: 'First: I think my comparison between the work of Atanasiu and that of Milo
    was misleading. If I left the impression that the former is somehow a superset
    of the latter, that is not correct. Milo applies the intricate rules of Arabic
    calligraphy to render arguably the best Arabic type out there &#40;if you subscribe
    to the chirographic school&#41;. Atanasiu first of all doesn&#39;t even have any
    software &#40;public or otherswise&#41; that actually does typography; his project
    involves the quantification of actual hands in Arabic calligraphy, such as that
    of ibn Muqla, and his algorithms work with continuums, so you could automatically
    render a hybrid hand between two &#34;presets&#34; for example; conceivably this
    means he can extend his work to render handwriting differently for each person,
    possibly by defining parameters like &#34;speed&#34;, &#34;confidence&#34; or
    who knows what else. Vlad has a book out&#42;, and it&#39;s one of the most wonderful
    works I&#39;ve ever read, not least because he fuses the aesthetic and mathematical
    spheres in that ancient way that hasn&#39;t been fashionable since the Enlightenment,
    even though it&#39;s really the most natural and effective way to explore reality.
    One small insight into this &#34;style&#34; is a graph in his book: it shows the
    letter usage frequency for half a dozen or so Western langages, with an illustration
    of a... full-on winged jinni sitting on top of it! :-&#62; As if to remind us:
    &#34;Don&#39;t forget the whole point of your humanity&#34;! Too much - too good.

    <BR>Here&#39;s Atanasiu&#39;s site: <BR><a href="http://www.atanasiu.freesurf.fr/thesis/"
    target="_blank">http://www.atanasiu.freesurf.fr/thesis/</a> <BR> <BR>BTW, both
    Vlad and Thomas are very interesting characters in person, and I personally feel
    a link with both of them: the former because of that ancient style of science
    that [I hope] I share, while the latter because he has experienced the Lebanese
    Civil War. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; is his studies that recent?? <BR> <BR>The
    book came out in 2000, but there&#39;s only the French version. His PhD defence
    was this past May - which reminds me that I should ask him how it went... The
    paper was a 244-page tour de force, but also in French. <BR> <BR>&#62; &#34;warmth&#34;
    <BR> <BR>I think most of all it comes from the reader knowing &#40;or actually,
    merely thinking&#41; that somebody used the tangible world to create it. This
    didn&#39;t used to be a big deal, but since the Industrial Revolution and especially
    the Computer Age, it&#39;s gained inceasing value mostly through its rarity, but
    also because in the end humans are at least half physical things. <BR> <BR>--

  body: I think the &#39;warmth&#39; of a letter has a lot less to do with anything
    type-related and a lot more to do with the simple fact that it took more effort
    on the senders part to get it to you. <BR> <BR>That said, I hate paper mail these

  body: 'Something just hit me like a ton of broad-nib pens: <BR> <BR>A very big difference
    between manual versus mechanical <BR>writing is that in the latter corrections
    are invisible. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not that there are no typos &#40;in fact there
    might <BR>be more, or at least of a different kind&#41;, it&#39;s that <BR>you
    can fix typos &#40;or simply change your mind about <BR>what to write&#41; without
    the reader seeing that. <BR> <BR>This is I think even more important than the
    usual <BR>difference people point out about handwriting and <BR>typography: that
    no two letters are exactly alike. <BR>In fact the mechanics of saccades &#40;where
    one can <BR>see only a maximum 4 letters totally clearly, and <BR>where arguably
    the short term memory about exact <BR>letterforms isn&#39;t retained between fixations&#41;
    can <BR>mean that if you have like three variants for each <BR>letter and use
    them in a cyclic fashion &#40;just like <BR>the Letterror boys do&#41; then you&#39;re

    with help from OpenType? <BR> <BR>So if you want a typographic system &#40;as

    it <BR>must incorporate a way to show mistakes/changes_of_mind. <BR> <BR>Also:

  body: No handwriting font or font technology could replace the warmth and human
    quality of handwriting. It&#39;s the direct, physical act of writing that makes
    it so unique, so human. <BR> <BR>I grew up without any mechanical means to write
    other than to do it by hand. When I was in school, we produced class magazines
    by handwriting. Informal posters, notes, letters, handouts, everything was handwriting.
    Very few things were typewritten even &#40;with manual Chinese typewriters!&#41;.
    If I wanted type, the only way to get it was to get it from a typesetting firm.
    There was a clear distinction between published and informal work. We&#39;re losing
    that all thanks to the computer. I still love handwriting things. The very act
    of writing is so satisfying and so contemplative. <BR> <BR>I write in English
    most of the time now, and I must say I really like the computer as a tool for
    writing. I can type so much faster than I can write, so using the computer to
    write is so much more efficient for me. But at the same time it&#39;s also sad
    that we don&#39;t see handwriting so much any more. <BR> <BR>The case is reversed
    for Chinese. My Chinese typing is extremely slow, so writing on the computer is
    an extremely tedious process. I simply can&#39;t write efficiently in Chinese
    on the computer. But then again writing by hand in Chinese is also a slow process.
    That&#39;s why handwriting is still used a lot in Chinese-speaking countries.
    And good handwriting continue to be an important skill to have. As the Chinese
    say, handwriting is a person&#39;s clothes. <BR> <BR>We need to move away from
    handwritten fonts, I think. A good everyday, informal typeface should not be a
    handwriting typeface. Ligatures and OpenType is not a solution. On the other hand,
    we need to revive and sustain handwriting in our increasingly typeset world!

    junk mail obvious are bold graphic statements on the envelopes. The only envelopes
    I open &#40;other than bills&#41; are plain envelopes that have no graphics on
    them and a simple return address, no logo. More often than not it a sales promotion,
    but they achieved their purpose, I opened the envelope. With e-mail I have filters
    that do most of the work, I&#39;d say 75% and I just can look at the sender and
    tell the other 25% of the junk and delete it with no eyeballs on it. I don&#39;t
    think type has any bearing on mail, but handwriting would. Just my opinion, Dan
