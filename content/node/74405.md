    is a good alternative. And <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/school_scripts/?&sample_text=vadisturner&update=0&affid=99346">here

  body: "Thanks Stephen. I appreciate you taking the time. I had seen that list and
    will probably just go with an alternative like Memimas or School Script if no
    one else chimes in. If it has stumped a man of your knowledge, then I at least
    feel better about not being able to spec it for her!\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nSteve"
