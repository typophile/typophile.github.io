  am unsure of other glyphs, but from what I remember, the <strong>O</strong> (maybe
  it was the lowercase o) looks very similar to the attached image. Any pointers?\r\n(That's
  not an actual glyph, I photoshopped that)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/O_3706.jpg]"

  body: "If there was only the one dot under, it might be Scriptorium's Chelsea Studio,
    JYArtsAndCrafts, Rennie MackintoshITC or Hill House.  With two dots side by side
    underneath, Glasgow or Esmount; with two vertical dots underneath, Willow or Greyhound;
    \ with three vertical dots, Rennie Mackintosh Dotted; with four dots in a square,
    Glaswegian or Mackintosh Renaissance. All fonts suggested by the Arts and Crafts
    Movement. Others if the 'O' is more handwritten-looking.\r\n\r\nI've never seen
    one with dots over  and under. Your reproducing it makes it more difficult unless
    it's an accurate reproduction; including  proportions, spacing, etc.\r\n\r\n -
