  his margins.\" (Grid systems in graphic design).\r\n\r\nCan someone please explain
  what tension is, how to create it or get rid of it and why it is needed?\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "Thanks Mike, so if I understood right, it's the way you design the margins
    that creates tension? i.e a layout with 4 equal margins has no tension?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Some layouts have more visual tension than others. A layout where everything
    is centered and symmetrical creates a looks that's very balanced and somewhat
    formal, but also can be dull.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a layout that has some
    non-symmetrical elements \u2014 rag right type, a large graphic that's not centered
    on the page, and so forth \u2014\_has more visual tension and therefore looks
    less formal and more energetic. \r\n\r\nAnother way to think about it might be
    to compare a layout to a garden. Have you ever seen pictures of a very formal
    garden at some estate where everything is laid out in a big symmetrical grid,
    with rows of neatly trimmed hedges, everything very formal and symmetrical? Compare
    that to a beautiful garden that's designed in a very different way, with a big
    fountain on one side, flowers on the other side, trees placed in seemingly random
    spots, etc. It almost seem chaotic by comparison, and yet the designer gave it
    an overall balance that makes it work.\r\n\r\nEither type of layout can be appropriate;
    just depends on the circumstances and what the designer is trying to achieve."

  body: "Just to be confusing ;) visual tension can be described as something to be
    avoided:\r\nhttp://illustrationclass.com/2007/04/13/avoiding-visual-tension/\r\n\r\nI
    think the general underlying principle is a bit related, but obviously not the
    same thing.  For example, it might maximize this kind of visual tension to set
    a block of text so that it is printed right up to the edge of the page, but probably
    that would not be what Muller-Brockmann has in mind."

  body: "Thanks for the explanation James, it makes a lot more sense now, I guess
    it's hard for me to understand it in a visual way, I keep thinking of someone
    stretching a rubber band and I then try(and fail) to link it to layout, but your
    comparison to landscape design made it easy to get.\r\n\r\nLuma: I do think that
    too much tension can have a negative effect, personally I like the look but I
    think it can be very distracting, especially when the block of text is right next
    to the edge, but I have seen some great designers make it look great, but then
    again does looking great = good design?"

  body: "> I keep thinking of someone stretching a rubber band...\r\n\r\nMaybe it
    would help if you thought of it as energy or excitement rather than tension. Compare
    the energy levels of these two layouts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example_4778.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    designer needs to create a layout that's appropriate to the occasion. For an ad
    for a sporting event, a high-energy layout might be very appropriate. But if you
    tried laying out pages of a novel that way, it obviously wouldn't work."

    contrast arranged asymmetrically in the modernist layout (Tschichoild, c.1930),
    large areas of light value balanced against smaller darker areas.\r\nThis balance
    creates tension, because it subtle and precarious, and because the centre of gravity
    is not marked by any graphic element, but is sensed by the viewer."
