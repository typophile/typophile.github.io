  HAS A NEW HOME AT FONTLAB LTD.\r\n\r\nFontlab Ltd. Licenses Legendary Font Editor,
  \r\nPlans to Continue Development\r\n\r\nFor Immediate Release\r\nMonday, May 9,

  \r\nPort Angeles, WA, USA, May 9, 2005: Fontlab Ltd. is pleased to announce the
  licensing from Macromedia Inc. of the Fontographer product line. \u201CFontographer
  is a respected name in the field of digital typography,\u201D said Ted Harrison,
  president of Fontlab Ltd. \u201CWe are proud to add this legendary font editor to
  our lineup of products.\u201D As of today, Fontlab will continue to sell the current
  version of Fontographer while beginning work on fixing bugs and preparing a new
  version - expected to be released early next year.\r\n\r\n\u201CWith nearly two
  decades of presence on the market, Fontographer has gained a reputation as an easy-to-use
  and reliable tool for creating digital fonts, and continues to boast a strong and
  dedicated user community among desktop publishers, graphic designers and typographers.
  We feel that Fontographer will find a secure and comfortable home at Fontlab Ltd.
  Our team is committed to continuing the development of a brand-new version of the
  product,\u201D said Harrison. \r\nHarrison continues, \u201CWith our TypeTool product
  we have a font editor for beginners, hobbyists and students. FontLab Studio and
  AsiaFont Studio are our high-end products with a certain degree of technical complexity,
  aimed at professional type designers. With Fontographer, we now have a tool that
  fills the gap between those products - a font editor for graphic designers and desktop
  publishers, powerful enough for real-world typography but without all the bells
  and whistles of our high-end products.\u201D\r\n\r\nFontlab Ltd. will offer upgrade
  paths from TypeTool 2 to Fontographer 4.1 (US$249) and from Fontographer 4.1 to
  FontLab Studio (US$299) and to AsiaFont Studio (prices to be announced.)\r\n\r\nFontlab
  will assume support for Fontographer version 4.1+ from Macromedia and will retain
  the services of Fontographer guru Jim Gallagher, who has nurtured Fontographer for
  the last ten years, and who will advise the Fontlab development team in their task
  of updating Fontographer.\r\n\r\nAbout Fontlab Ltd.\r\n\r\nFontlab Ltd. is the world\u2019s
  leading developer of digital typography solutions. Their full line of products is
  dedicated to solving typographic issues ranging from the simple to the most complex.
  These products include: AsiaFont Studio\u2122, BitFonter\u2122, FontLab Studio\u2122,
  ScanFont\u2122, TypeTool\u2122, TransType\u2122, FontFlasher\u2122, FONmaker\u2122,

  body: Hi there, I don't mean to put this the wrong way, but just wondering what
    advantage there is in maintaining two platforms over releasing a halfway house
    between TypeTool and FontLab Studio? I speak from near ignorance having only used
    TypeTool, but assume TT is a cut-down version of FLS?

    even if I had known that an OSX, FL-friendly FOG was coming to market, I probably
    still would have made the switch.\r\n\r\nI can't imagine going back to FOG now.
    FL is different, but I like it. Especially what I've seen from Studio 5. Sigh\u2026\r\n\r\nI
    imagine that Bill Troop will be beside himself. Whether he will be beside himself
    with joy or anger, I cannot predict.\r\n\r\nI guess that this means that FL Studio
    5 will be able to open FOG databases now?\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    can already open most .fog files with plans to extend it to full support. \r\n\r\nThere
    will be more information about Fog future available soon. Generally saying, we
    will support it as it is now for some time (we have some plans to release OS X
    compatible version of Fog4) with plans to merge platforms next year. It means
    that there will be a next Fog which will combine best features of FL and Fog and
    will be positioned in between FontLab Studio and TypeTool. "

    for an up-to-date version. As soon as the Adobe/Macromedia merger happened I emailed
    Adobe to plea for Fog's revival - the inclusion of Jim Gallagher, 'the Fontmeister',
    is a superb decision, he has been generous with his genius and an inspiration
    to Fog lovers everywhere! I just hope they don't fuck about too much with Fog's
    easy-to-use drawing tools!\r\n\r\nKeith"

    they always were in the new OSX Fog. Do not link them as in Fontlab, as they are
    2 separate functions.\r\n\r\nAND - keep it simple! super redundancy is all very
    well, but can be confusing (and unnecessary)."

    was smart enough to nab the fog from the fire.

  body: "Yuri, FontLab Gang . . .\r\n\r\nFirst, I just got my Typophile account reset
    again and upon reading the news of your licensing of Fontographer code I was delighted
    and puzzled at the same time.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'm certainly looking forward to an
    updated Fontographer that sits on X comfortably and renders aliased with the same
    functionality. In fact this application update alone may once and for all allow
    me to cut all ties with the Classic OS.\r\n\r\nNow, that said since you've got
    the source code in your hot hands, I am puzzled to what level you intend to update/enhance
    Fontographer. Would a completely updated FOG make FontLab obsolete or will you
    simply offer a 'reduced' feature set compared to the capabilities of FontLab?\r\n\r\nLike
    I said, I'm delighted but I don't understand the future differences of these two
    applications? I can do MOST of my fontmaking work still in FOG minus clean hinting
    and really nice font generation which I use FLAB for. So once you update those
    things in FOG, why would I need FLAB?\r\n\r\nStuart :D"
