  is an installation and a website project that take place in Lille, France.\r\nAs
  part of \"Bombaysers de Lille\", a cultural event dealing with indian arts,\r\nwe
  were asked to realise a project hosted at \"La Maison de l'Architecture\r\net de
  la Ville\".\r\n\r\nThe project is composed of a fresco and the calacalacity.fr website.\r\n\r\nThe
  fresco aims to be the towncenter of this imaginery indian city.\r\nVisitors have
  the opportunity to create and develop it through a flash interface\r\nand to see
  their creations placed on the map.\r\n\r\nIt is indirectly link to typography as
  you may see in the image attached.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to have a look around
  and to participate.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.calacalacity.fr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  t\xE9lescopique crew\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/calacalacity_5535.jpg]\r\n\r\nComments
  are also welcome."

    use though (can't seem to find anything back on it).

    the pictures in any way relate to the letters or is it just random? \r\n\r\nCheers,
