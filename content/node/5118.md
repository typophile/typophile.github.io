    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR><i>&#40; Ive tried to sign up for the FontFont keywording,
    hmm, thing, back then, but somehow I was not able to do so.. Additionally, I think
    that speaking English, better, would be a big bonus, for keywording typefaces..

  body: by the way trademaker is a modified version of serpentine. mr critzer just
    cut off the miniserifs and reworked the uppercase letters plus made some modifications
    on some of the lowercase letters - compare e for example.
