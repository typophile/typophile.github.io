body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to write a Opentype code with one-to-multiple
  glyphs, but Fontlab and FDK won't compile it.\r\nFor example, I want to substitute
  \xDF by a couple of smallcap S in smcp feature, and I want to make SS separate (spacable,
  kernable or whatever). Some fonts have smallcap counterpart of \xDF as SS as a single
  glyph, but obviously you cannot space it.\r\n\r\nThere are some other characters
  that I want to apply this substitution, I really want to figure out how to do it
  (or whether it is possible or not). I also heard that Adobe apps including FDK do
  not support this substitution but Microsoft apps do. Is it correct?\r\n\r\nI would
  like to know whatever you know about this.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Ps. If you want to make sure that something reasonable will happen in applications
    that do not support it, you can do the following: \r\n\r\n<code>feature smcp {
    \r\n  lookup smcp1 { \r\n    sub germandbls by germandbls.smcp; \r\n    ...all
    the other smcp substitutions...\r\n  } smcp1; \r\n  lookup smcp2 { \r\n    sub
    germandbls.smcp by s.smcp s.smcp; \r\n  } smcp2; \r\n} smcp;</code>\r\n\r\nThis
    way, OpenType engines will have two passes at your text. The first step will replace
    germandbls with a ligature version of small-cap \"ss\", which you of course do
    need to include in your font in that situation, and the second pass (i.e. the
    second lookup) will replace that one with two small-cap \"s\"es, but this lookup
    will be ignored if an application doesn't support one-to-many. So in the newer
    apps, you'll get two small-cap \"s\"es, and in older ones, you'll get the \"ss\"
    small-cap ligature. An acceptable compromise, I think. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Adam, it works! (Why couldn't I solve such a simple problem?)\r\nI
    do agree that the two-step substitution is a good compromise.\r\n\r\nAlso, I want
    to have a stylistic sets that substitutes Arabic figures by Roman figures.\r\nThis
    time FDK refuses to generate otf for sure, saying \"Unsupported contextual GSUB
    replacement sequence\".\r\n(If I remove Two Digits section, it works.)\r\nBy the
    way, I do understand such an usage is strongly discouraged, but I want to understand
    why it doesn't work.\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>@figures=<strong>[</strong>zero one two

    that solved all the question I had (probably). I still cannot find the way I originally

    of one particular type can be in one lookup, but if you have one non-contextual

    Layout works. "
