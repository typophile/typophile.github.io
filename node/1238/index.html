		<div class="commentbody">People all over the world get killed in huge numbers with awful frequency. It is terrible and it is frightening and most of the time no one gives it much thought. The scale of the New York attack was impressive for non-state sanctioned killing, but there are people who spend every day for years living with terrorism and war in their towns and cities. So perhaps this is how we should remember &#39;9/11&#39;: by calling to mind the people who have lived through so many atrocities that they don&#39;t keep track of the dates any more.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; The scale of the New York attack was impressive for non-state sanctioned killing <BR> <BR>Especially when you consider how cheap it was to carry out &#40;~$200,000&#41;. <BR>The US has to spend millions of dollars to kill 3000 people, and billions to occupy the land they used to live on. <BR> <BR>&#62; people who were not there <BR> <BR>I was there. Not in Manhattan on that one day, but in Beirut for years. And I still agree with you! <BR> <BR>James&#39;s tragic recollections reminded me so much of home: the phosphor smell from the hi-tech Israeli bombs that hit my dad&#39;s laboratory/office, the smell of my dog&#39;s urine stain that I was trying to clean from one of our Persian carpets as one of my uncles suddenly showed up to tell me that his brother had been assassinated, the furious wail of a Druze mobile Katyousha battery using our building as cover to random-bomb the Phalangist Christian neighborhoods, the uneasy silence during my 2-4 AM shift guarding my high school with a Chinese imitation of a &#34;Klashin&#34;, the symbolic but awesome shelling of a deserted Syrian outpost in the Bekaa Valley by the meter-wide cannons of the New Jersey warship five miles off the coast, and the hopeless but almost festive firing of anti-aircraft guns at it, with the vermillion flare rounds bouncing off the surface of the Mediterranean repeatedly, like some ethereal ballet - and so many other utterly unforgettable things. I think people with childhoods like that can be forgiven for being a little crazy. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m so glad John and Hrant and Steve &#40;and my partner as well&#41; said what I&#39;ve, as an American, been afraid to. One generally doesn&#39;t, not here, not in my semi-rural part of Pennsylvania. <BR> <BR>What I remember most about 9/11, is actually after 9/11. Americans became kinder, more patient and were jolted out of our standard-issue self-absorption. I had to travel shortly after the attacks and saw this attitude shift in full effect at the airports I passed through. Previously, few things seemed to bring out  the &#34;me first,&#34; rude, cold, rushed, bad behavior like flying. But this time... strangers made eye contact, spoke to each other and were helpful. There was a warmth and solidarity generally missing in our society. <BR> <BR>I am sad to say it hasn&#39;t seemed to have lasted which makes this period all the more memorable.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was listening to WNYC our classical non-profit station when it suddenly went off air, I turned on News 1 New York and saw the first tower was hit. Thats where WNYC&#39;s tranmitters were, as I was watching I saw the 2nd jet live go into the 2nd tower. It was desturbing enough I had to get out on my bike in Central Park. I was riding for about 1/2 hour when steams of people were walking across the park, I didn&#39;t associate it with the WTC, but what happened is the city shut itself down and since the trains weren&#39;t running they had to walk home. The by product of the tragedy is Mahanttan had been in a bad recession and was made worse. We are still in recession two years later. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, for a couple of weeks, I think there was an increase in kindness and concern for others that was pretty widespread in the USA. It&#39;s the natural first response to tragedy, to try to help, to try to support, and only later do people start thinking about blame and revenge. I remember Tom Milo at the ATypI conference in Copenhagen, relating the epic story of his roundabout journey from California back to Europe in the aftermath of the attack: he described the consideration shown to everyone stranded at the various airports, the volunteerism, and the lack of selfishness, and remarked that he&#39;d felt privileged to have been there and witnessed it. This from someone else who was in Lebanon during the civil war, albeit as a UN intelligence officer rather than as a civilian with the front line in his living room. <BR> <BR>It was only as the dust settled, literally, and the people like Ashcroft and Rumsfeld began to exploit the situation that the ugly side came out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My son was less than half a mile away, near the Brooklyn Bridge, when the burning towers collapsed. In that moment he lost his youth, though he is still in his 20&#39;s. <BR> <BR>He followed a path like many of his computer-studies classmates of working in the dot-com boom, and then going to work for financial companies after the bust. Three of his graduating class were murdered in the 9-11 attack.  <BR> <BR>Art was used to express grief and anger. My son told me that a poster immediately appeared many places in lower Manhattan - where my son and daughter &#40;she watched the collapse from her rooftop at a safe distance&#41; live. <BR> <BR>It was never photographed or reported in the press, to my knowledge. It was a variation on the famous &#39;I want you&#39; recuitment poster with &#39;Uncle Sam&#39; pointing at the viewer. &#40;I know it is based in turn on a British poster.&#41; The variation was that instead of pointing at the viewer, Uncle Sam had an upturned middle finger, and the caption was &#39;We&#39;re coming to get you motherf&#42;&#42;&#42;er.&#39;  <BR> <BR>&#62;This good guys v bad guys stuff is ridiculous. <BR> <BR>I agree that being simplistic is a very serious problem in political thinking, especially about foreigners. But there are bad guys. The Taliban qualify. They deserved what they got.  <BR> <BR>America is often the good guy and sometimes the bad guy. It is complicated. But the knee-jerk anti-Americanism I read on these boards I think is seriously misguided, and the product of simplistic and dangerous &#39;black and white&#39; thinking. It is a cheap way to feel superior, not a result of real understanding.   <BR> <BR>The main problem with it is not that America doesn&#39;t do stupid and bad things. It is that most governments in the world are so much worse that they can&#39;t even be mentioned in the same breath as far as badness. My wife has worked all over the world in a UN organization, and is of the very well informed opinion that the reason most of the poverty and misery in the world is due to bad governments, many of which have been just gangsters, mafias. The US government is not, and never has been this bad, and that is why it has peace and prosperity - uneven though these are - within its borders.  <BR> <BR>Right now the US is at its peak of power in the world. If the Taliban had the same power, you would know what bad is.  <BR> <BR>Also this stuff about the US being so narrow minded and intolerant is crap. I am in an inter-racial marriage, and know people here from all over the world, including many multi-national and multi-racial couples. And they vote with their feet to come here because it is so tolerant. Again, this is by comparison. There are plenty of American bigots. It is just that most other societies are much more intolerant than the US.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t particularly want to argue about all this on these boards. I want to learn about type from all of the wonderful typofiles here. But on this day, as the question was raised, I thought it might be appropriate to introduce a little balance and get people to think twice about their knee jerk anti-Americanism.   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, I live in Manhattan, about 4 miles from the WTC site, I still haven&#39;t been down there and its two years ago now and I hope I never will. Its a burial site, to me, not a place to rebuild. As I was walking in my neighborhood I noticed that you can go a block and see people who represent every country in the world who live here. Americans in Manhattan are an international community, so ladies and gentlemen please don&#39;t paint your opinions with such big brushes. An example: A bunch of cyclist are riding 3 and 4 abreast, and blocking traffic, therefore all cyclists ride 3 and 4 abreast and block traffic. </div>

Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador... The School of the Americas &#40;excuse me, I mean WHISC&#41;... we recoil at the barbaric rule of other countries and the single-minded torture they carry out, but it&#39;s by no means metaphorical to say that the U.S. uses those same means to achieve their political ends. <BR> <BR>I feel sick every time I hear someone say about Sept. 11, &#34;The world changed that day.&#34;  Many were killed, many still grieve, and many had a sense of safety ripped away, but the world did not change.  <BR>  <BR>By the way, I&#39;ve listened to National Public Radio all day today and yesterday, and haven&#39;t heard one mention of Anna Lindh.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, against my better judgment... <BR> <BR>The last few posts are on the mark. The US is very culpable for supporting rotten governments during the cold war.  <BR> <BR>But the weird thing to me is that now we do some good things and we are suddenly unspeakable.  <BR> <BR>For example, after Europe cravenly lets Bosnia go to hell, we finally intervene and stop the slaughter of Muslims. So we of course are a bunch of vicious anti-Muslim bastards, and Europe is pure and holy.  <BR> <BR>Then this Arab Fascist Saddam is responsible for the death of more Muslims probably than anybody in history - hundreds of thousands at any rate. We, ill advisedly or not, invade to rid the country of Saddam.  <BR> <BR>The Iraqi army, who evidentally hates Saddam&#39;s guts, throws down their weapons and goes home. His group of henchmen then conduct a reargard action of sabotage to prevent decent civil life from coming back to Iraq. So having given Iraqis a chance for a better life, at the cost of American lives, and now willing to pour billions into its reconstruction, we and the Brits are just disgusting oppressors of Muslims.  <BR> <BR>So we deserve to be lectured and castigated and condemned for throwing out Milosovic and Saddam. It&#39;s really horrible what we did. But not a word of condemnation for these regimes. No. Lets spend all our emotions on hating that repulsively smug rich frat boy, GWB.  <BR> <BR>Why not go further and condemn the US for throwing out Hitler and Musolini? Attack that disgusting Roosevelt and Churchill who presumed to interene against those whom they arrogantly called tryants and threats to humanity.  <BR>  </div>

This thread exists not because two or three thousand people were killed 2 years ago today, but because those people were mainly Americans. <BR>When two or three thousand people of other nationalities die the anniversary goes largely un-noticed. <BR> <BR>Note, for example, that between your first post &#40;1:00 pm&#41; and your second &#40;4:33 pm&#41; over 4000 people starved to death. <BR>Is George Dubya going to start a war on hunger, or poverty, or disease? <BR>What do you think? <BR>&#40;Here&#39;s a clue: There&#39;s no oil involved, nor any other immediate economic benefit for the USA&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, because my wife has worked for many years on problems of poverty in less developed countries, I discuss them practically every night, and am very well aware of the challenge of helping these countries.  <BR> <BR>The view of my wife, who comes from one of these countries, is that the primary responsibility for the misery of these countries is the leadership in them, and that those in the West who think that the US or Europe controls everything are patronizing and wrong. The indulgence and support of rotten regimes by both America and Europe have, though, exaserbated the problems.  <BR> <BR>I am very distressed about our policies that hurt poor countries. And I am in despair that the left and the right are pretty clueless about what is actually going on.  <BR> <BR>For example, GW recently paid off rich American farmers with huge subsidies - against his supposed free market principles and in a craven attempt to buy votes in farm states.   <BR> <BR>This move will wreck the ability of legions of farmers in poor countries to earn a livelihood from farming, and drive them in desparation to the city slums - and incidentally many poor central americans across our borders. The only thing that can be said not to condemn this policy as distinctively devilish is that the agricultural policies of the European Union are even worse - More protectionist, more subsidies undercuting the ability of those in poor countries to making a living by competing fairly.  <BR> <BR>Since trade arguably has a much bigger impact than aid on the poor countries are you denouncing Tony Blair and Jacque Chirac and other European leaders for causing the starvation of millions? Or is your ire just reserved for GW?  <BR> <BR>European anti-americanism is a cheap substitute for real understanding and sound policy.  <BR> <BR>-Just blame the US and get indignant, when in fact the problems and the solutions are very complex, and involve the US and Europe and Japan changing their policies. And most of all the leadership in the poor countries needs to change or actually starting to care about their people. Whenever they do, the countries actually experience economic growth, and fewer people go hungry.  <BR> <BR>Are you denouncing those in poor countries who are actually most responsible for the plight of their people? Or only the US?  <BR> <BR>I see simplistic, conspiratorial thinking going on all the time. People scream about symbols while the substance of policy is neglected.  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; leadership in the poor countries needs to change <BR> <BR>No, the attitude of the people with power &#40;ie Americans&#41; has to change, because the US can change any regime it wants with a snap of the fingers - but of course only governments whose toppling is useful to Big Business suffer that fate. The US created Saddaam, but now that they need the borders of Iraq to serve as their self-validating terrorist threat &#40;now that Afghanistan is no longer useful in that capacity&#41; as well as a source of oil alternative to Saudi Arabia, they got rid of him &#40;quite possibly by simply telling him it was time to go&#41;. There are so many realities you conveniently ignore, it&#39;s impossible to think you&#39;re doing anything but rehashing what you were fed as a child. <BR> <BR>And if Americans really wanted to, a fraction of the people who currently starve to death would suffer that fate. But they don&#39;t, because their system has taught them to care first and foremost about their selves. Your society is decrepit. A simple rummage through the trashcan of the average American establishes this instantly. <BR> <BR>With power comes responsability - this is the one thing that the US has to take to heart, otherwise it will continue to be the overgrown teenager with the biggest club. The entire foundation of your political thought is based on the contrivance that your government is sound. It is not. Your leaders are murderous thieves, and worst of all the population supports them - not because they&#39;re as bad, they don&#39;t realize what&#39;s going on - but because they&#39;ve been brainwashed since birth to think the US is good overall. It is not. It has become the single greatest cause of misery to the greatest number of people on Earth. Why? To feed its own obese shell of a society. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>You&#39;re severely outnumbered here for one reason only: this is an international forum, with people who have not suffered your brainwashing. The saddest thing is that it will take decades and many more large-scale attacks on the US for you to finally snap out of it. You are being sent to slaughter to make rich people richer. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;Anyway, we should remember to all of them indeed. <BR> <BR>Thank you JFP. I was beginning to think that Europeans are so blinded by Anti-Americanism that normal human sympathy is suspended.  <BR> <BR>&#62;This thread exists not because two or three thousand people were killed 2 years ago today, but because those people were mainly Americans. <BR> <BR>Uh, this site is hosted in America and many Americans post on the site, and non-Americans who live here, like the one who started this thread. And many who post here were personally affected, including me. If your reasoning were correct, the proper way to respond to the anniversary of your Uncle&#39;s death is to berate your Aunt for grieving and not thinking about the starving masses in poor countries. Americans are not worth sympathizing with, because they are the devil incarnate.  <BR> <BR>&#62;the US can change any regime it wants with a snap of the fingers  <BR> <BR>Sure, that&#39;s why we threw out Castro in 1990, just after the fall of the Soviet Union. Fantasy, and invective built on fantasy.  <BR> <BR>&#62;$160,000,000,000 spent &#40;so far&#41; dropping cluster bombs, napalm, and depleted uranium on Iraqis could have been used to:  <BR> <BR>1. Pay all the debt of Africa.  <BR>2. Feed all the starving children in the world.  <BR>3. Provide the educational needs of every child on the planet.  <BR> <BR>According to costofthewar.com last night 73 billion had been spent on the war, not 160, and we are about to commit 75 billion just trying to lift one countrty, Iraq, out of poverty - and it has oil, as many have pointed out. Spent Uranium are bullets, not bombs, and I believe napalm was not used at all. The idea that the US or Europe can wipe out poverty and ignorance around the world with a one shot spending is nonsense.  <BR> <BR>For example over half of the budget of Bengla Desh, for years is paid by foreign aid, and they are still mired in horrible poverty - and not coincidentally have one of the most corrupt governments. The fact that you don&#39;t know what you are talking about doesn&#39;t matter though. So long as it is anti-American most will nod and be happy. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>     <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Is it any wonder that countries are turning against America and Europe. <BR>1. Yes, Bangladesh is subsidised and yes, the government has corruption problems, but at Cancun, while Koreans stab themselves to death, America and Europe are trying to destroy the alliance of G21. G21 are seeking to stop richer nations dumping their subsidised surplus goods on markets where local farmers cannot compete.  <BR>The world&#39;s poorer countries lose a total of $24bn a year because of the subsidies paid to farmers by rich nations, according to new research by economists in Washington. <BR>In addition to the $24bn lost by poor countries, a further $40bn in agricultural exports could be generated by developing countries if protectionist policies were abandoned by developed nations. <BR>Current subsidies per cow: <BR>EU: $803  <BR>USA: $1,057  <BR>JAPAN: $2,555 <BR>2. International trade rules are agreed between countries at meetings of the World Trade Organisation &#40;WTO&#41;. Every country that is a member of the WTO is entitled to be represented and is governed by international trade rules. The US has 250 permanent representatives at the WTO while Bangladesh has only one. Many countries cannot afford to have any representatives. <BR>3. Iraq is not poverty-stricken, it has huge oil resources and a well educated population, if it is allowed to trade fairly it will lift itself out of poverty - the $75bn is more in the line of replacing infrastructure destroyed by warfare &#40;much of that amount going to American corporations&#41;. <BR>4.
