  only cross platform &#40;Mac and PC&#41; slots without any custom encodings . .
  . <BR> <BR>My question is, what is my max slots and what are they? <BR> <BR>By my
  count so far it&#39;s: <BR> <BR>A-Z - 26 <BR>a-z - 26 <BR>0-9 - 10 <BR>shift 0-9
  - 10 <BR>-_=&#43;[]&#123;}|;&#39;:&#34;,./&#60;&#62;? - 20 <BR> <BR>That would be
  92 by my count . . . <BR> <BR>Am I missing any? Do I have some I shouldn&#39;t?
  BTW, I do not wish to include the space character slot in this count . . . <BR>
  <BR>Thanks All! <BR>Stuart :D'

    after, some of these may not be useful. For instance, people using Central European
    keyboard layouts won&#39;t be able to access some of these characters, but they
    all exist in both MacRoman and Windows ANSI. Also, some people may not be able
    to figure out how to type a lot of these, even if they are accessible. <BR> <BR>In
    any case, it might be best to stick with characters that can be typed using only
    shifted and unshifted keys. That would rule out most of what I&#39;ve listed above
    &#40;except the backslash&#41;, at least on US keyboards.
