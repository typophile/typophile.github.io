  body: I think the 'normal' is very light for a normal weight. Or is it me?

  body: I find these letters way to wide. I'm not a fan of wide type but this one
    definitely not just looks wide but also stretched. Which is not good.

  body: "Jelmar (Quincunx ) is right.\r\n\r\nI find that the bold is working better
    than the light. \r\n\r\nThe strech feeling comes mostly from big apertures in
    the p p q & o. They look stretched. The others don't so much. They need to match.
    \r\n\r\nLook at the spaces between the letters. Look at the spaces inside. see
    how the big openings don't work with the letter spaces? They need to relate to
    each other & feel good together. Sculpt that white & forget the black for a while.
    Then when you can see the white spaces properly come back to the black & then
    see them together.\r\n\r\nI think the leg on the cap L is a very good width.\r\n\r\nThe
    g needs reconsidering.\r\n\r\nThe tooth on the Cap C seems like it's too much.\r\n\r\nBefore
    you get too crazy - ask yourself ( and maybe tell us ) - what is this for?  The
    better answer to that question you have the better the font.\r\n\r\nKeep going."

  body: 'I think things are clearly getting better! The bold seems to have really
    come into it''s own! Here are some suggestions: About the thin parts - their use
    could be nice but because they only occur in some letters & not in others it creates
    an uneven effect which I think isn''t ideal. I think you should decide to keep
    them & expand their use or make  the thinking more subtle. The spacing between
    letters is getting much better. It seems more right in the case of the bold still.
    With the lighter weight I would consider gently narrowing the wider openings c,
    o, b etc and keeping your overall spacing scheme. Or letting the lighter letters''
    spaces open up more to match the counters. If it was me I would go with the 1st
    option because it would make the face more versatile. The second option is a good
    one for making a display face because it plays to the distinctiveness of what
    you have. I think the g is still not quite what you want but it is an improvement.
    What about an more typical one store g design and leaving this one or a similar
    design as an option? Your design seems like it would be a natural home for a one
    g with just one level. If you want to keep the double story the bold g you have
    is the better one. And actually I quite like it, but I think it needs an ear to
    work perfectly. There is something odd about the lc o I can''t say for sure what
    it is. Maybe it''s an artifact, but does it have the same height and depth as
    your lower case e? Probably it should. The nearly touching in the ft & FT seems
    like something to fix. Either let them overlap or don''t. I would not. Congratulations
    on great progress!'

    talking about.\r\n\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/img/arnhem-2.gif\r\n\r\nI should
    note that this designer, in addition to keeping a nice balance of inside & outside
    white has done something else as well, something that you may or may not want
    to do. He has kept the width of the glyphs constant instead of making them wider
    as they get bolder which is more common and which may be easier."

  body: I can't speak to the cyrillic, but the latin lc x seems too wide. The Narrow
    bits seem a little too narrow. It's interesting how different the words veldt,
    and zephyrs seem like they fit well. Look at the others & see if they do as well
    & if not why. The top of the e might overshoot a bit more. Does it go as far as
    the o? Look at the space between the i & c in quick. Now look at the other side
    u & i. They feel too different.
