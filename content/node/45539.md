body: "The typeface foundry and subsidiary of Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc., Linotype
  GmbH, has introduced the Frutiger Serif typeface family, a new 20-font offering
  was designed by Akira Kobayashi, type director at Linotype, and Adrian Frutiger,
  who designed the original Frutiger sans serif design along with other popular typeface
  families including Univers, Avenir and Vectora. \r\n\r\nThe Frutiger Serif design
  is based on the Meridien\xAE typeface, one of Frutiger\u2019s first, released in
  1957. The Frutiger Serif typeface family is available in five weights ranging from
  light to heavy, and all weights are available in both regular and condensed versions.
  Each has a corresponding italic, in addition to a condensed italic. The Frutiger
  Serif fonts support 48 western, central and eastern European languages, including
  Baltic and Turkish. The fonts are available in the OpenType\xAE cross-platform format
  and include OpenType features such as ligatures, small caps and several numerical
  figures.\r\n\r\nIndividual Frutiger fonts, selection packs and typeface families
  can be viewed online at www.linotype.com, www.fonts.com and www.faces.co.uk. \r\n\r\nThe
  initial Frutiger typeface was originally designed by Frutiger for the Charles-de-Gaulle
  Airport in Paris in the 1970s. In 1997, he completed the Frutiger Next family, developed
  for signage at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich and then becoming commercially available
  in 2000 as a Linotype typeface. Other variations available from the Linotype Library
  are the Frutiger Stones\u2122 family, which incorporates the look of polished pebbles
  as the boundary; the Frutiger Symbols design, a family of symbol fonts; the Frutiger
  Capitalis design, a font containing ornamental glyphs; and Frutiger Arabic, designed
  by Nadine Chahine of Linotype and released last year.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I assume that renaming the typeface to "Frutiger Serif" is a marketing ploy
    to capitalize on the popularity of Frutiger? (Which, I suppose, we must now start
    calling Frutiger Sans...)

  body: "Ohie, I'm not sure how I feel about this. I've been a long time fan of Meridien.
    I'm always for large families with many weights, but I'm not sure I understand
    why they would expand the weight set and then rename it Frutiger Serif (aside
    from the obvious importance of relating it to Frutiger). I really will detest
    the day that all fonts exist in Serif and Sans Serif versions\u2014where's the
    variety?!\r\n\r\nIs it possible that the new Frutiger Serif is intended more purely
    for digital use, while Meridien would be expected more for ink on paper?"
