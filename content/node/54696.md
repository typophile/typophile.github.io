  work?  I'm having fun but curves (S, O, P, etc) are challenging. Is there some simple
  advice you can give me? A series of question from a rookie\u2026\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "The term \"one stroke\" or \"single stroke\" that you find in all these old
    lettering books refers the strokes of the letter being single brush stroke wide.
    An S, for example might be made of three separate strokes. A C from two or three.\r\n\r\nIf
    you try to paint like a large version of your handwriting, or copy certain script
    alphabets you might be able to make some letters with one long stroke. However
    for a neat, traditional sign painters gothic, or even a casual, utility style
    (the kind of thing [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit|House Industries
    Sign Painter]] series is based on) you will actually need to break down those
    curves into a few separate strokes.\r\n\r\nGet hold of one of the Speedball lettering
    books. There are usually a few on eBay. The earlier editions are the better as
    they are aimed at both pen and brush lettering where as I think later ones are
    more pen-based, although they still give a breakdown of strokes.\r\n\r\nHave a
    look at Pierre Tardif's youtube demonstrations: [[http://www.youtube.com/user/ptardifinc]].
    I love watching these!\r\n\r\nWhat sort of brush are you using?"

    workshops... they will open up your eyes and speed the discovery process, especially
    if you are going this alone. You will learn from the students and teachers alike
    as information in workshops flows pretty freely.  \r\n\r\nIan is right... practice
    - but learn from your mistakes!\r\n\r\nAnd Justin is correct, the older Speedball
    books have more ductus exemplars and less of the pretty examples with no hint
    as to how they are achieved. People would have a tough time emulating some of
    my work that appears in them as I use odd tools and touch up heavily : )\r\n\r\nCheck
