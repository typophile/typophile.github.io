body: Hi, I'm trying to make words on a buidling by getting people to switch on and
  off their lights, anyone know what would be the best kind fo font etc for something
  like this.. I have had a bit of a try on hotoshop only at mo, and it's hard...the
  building is Bewick court in Newcastle, if you google the block, you can see lots
  of images... I can;t really find a way for a B etc... Also at mo I can only get
  four letters on the side of the buidling, so fonts that could be made using less
  windows would be great..thanks in advance for any help as feel a bit lost in it
  all.. anton

  body: I don't think any font would specifically meet your needs. What you need to
    do is grid out the windows/lights on each building and then build bitmap letters.
    A grid 3 wide by 5 high can get you most of the letters, though some will require
    a wider grid.

  body: Do I understand correctly that each pair of little windows looks into the
    same room and therefore comprises one pixel? That makes it 7 wide by 19 tall.
    Can you tell us what the message is you want to send? I can probably help come
    up with something.
