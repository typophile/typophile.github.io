body: "A couple of weeks ago I posted a topic regarding entire word substitution in
  FontLab. During that post I received a hyperlink to an Adobe forum that shed some
  light on the matter. After spending much time figuring out the Python language \u2013
  I finally managed to make a substitution. But there was a catch! I wasn\u2019t able
  to exchange a shorter word for a longer one. For example I had no trouble switching
  the Swedish word \u2018hemskt\u2019 (awful) for the Swedish word \u2018sk\xF6nt\u2019
  (pleasant) -- but when I tried the other way around it didn\u2019t seem to cut it?\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature
  calt { \r\n\r\nlookup calt.pri1 {\r\n  sub h' e m s k t by s ;\r\n  sub s e' m s
  k t by k ;\r\n  sub s k m' s k t by odieresis ;\r\n  sub s k odieresis s' k' t by
  n ;\r\n  sub s k odieresis n t' by t ;\r\n  } calt.pri1;\r\n  \r\n} calt;\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty
  please with sugar on the top -- will anyone help me?\r\n\r\nKTKM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Kristian, \r\n\r\nthe Adobe FDK for OpenType library responsible for building
    OpenType Layout tables in the version 1.6 that is built into FontLab Studio 5
    is not able to make one-to-many substitutions. The stand-alone Adobe FDKO for
    OpenType (AFDKO) version 2.0 is able to create such subsitutions, so you\u2019re
    able to write: \r\n\r\nsub a by b c; \r\n\r\nHowever, none of the Adobe Creative
    Suite applications supports such substitutions, so even if you successfully put
    them in your font (e.g. using AFDKO 2 or using Microsoft VOLT), they won\u2019t
    work in InDesign, Illustrator or Photoshop. Some other applications may support
    them though. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    Studio relies on the older AFDKO means that you cannot generate OT fonts with
    certain lookup types* and <cite>also</cite> means that FLS cannot display features
    in the OT preview panel if features include such lookup types. So, no FLS-based
    demo ...\r\n\r\n* E.g. one-by-many substitutions or contextual positioning.\r\n\r\n<cite>But,
    is there another way to install the FDK tools for FontLab? I\u2019m not very handy
    with terminal application.</cite>\r\n\r\nIf you stick to the installation guide,
    installation is easy, and many question have been dealt with in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28277?comments_per_page=500\"
    target=\"_blank\">AFDKO2 thread</a>. The PDF about 'makeotf', which is the tool
    to compile an OpenType font from an .otf/.pfa font plus feature text file, is
    a very good manual.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "Kristian, \r\n\r\nyou will need to use the commandline Adobe FDK for OpenType
    2.0. However, its use is fairly simple: from FontLab Studio 5, you just generate
    a Type 1 font, save a .fea features file, and then use the .pfb, .inf and .fea
    files from MakeOTF that comes with AFDKO 2. \r\n\r\nYou should be able to use
    Windows XP Notepad to do your testing/demo, because it does support the one-to-many
    substitutions. You need to activate multilingual complex script support in Windows
    (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Multilingual_support_(Indic)#Windows_XP_and_Server_2003
    ). Then, it will work (\"calt\" is one of the few features that are enabled by
    default in Notepad when complex script support is activated). I think a Notepad
    demo is actually more impressive than a demo in InDesign: \"Look, it even works
    in Notepad!\"\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
