  on hinting, but i'm only using software-libre on typeface designing (like Fontforge
  instead on Fontlab, Inkscape instead of Illustrator, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe problem is
  Fontforge has no direct hinting support, and it needs an external help from a tool
  named xgridfit.\r\n\r\nDo someone know how this work, and how can we efficiently
  work on it and Fontforge together? If it is, are there some useful and simple to
  follow documentation?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! :)"

    hinting are very helpful to understand what all the gibberish means \u2026 while
    the xgridfit documentation isn't very well structured, to say the least.\r\n\r\nI
    now understand how it works, but I still haven't found a way to make the XML coding
    efficient.*\r\nI have to admit I've given up and asked the guys at MS to send
    me a copy of VTT.\r\n\r\n* to be frank, XML is the most time-consuming format
    I can imagine for this process. It shouldn't take too long to implement a visual
    frontend for the Fontforge GUI ..."

  body: "xgridfit is by no means required to do hinting in FontForge, it is designed
    as an xml-based higher level language replacement of the assembly-like TrueType
    instructions, and that is what it is all about. It works be generating a FontForge
    script that will do the actual instructions, apart from that it has no direct
    relation to FontForge.\r\n\r\nFontForge has built-in support for Type1 hinting
    and TrueType instructions, and autohinting as well, check the documentation for
    more details, http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/realindex.html#Hints."
