  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone! I am a designer at a large non-profit corporation that is in the process of re-branding. This corporation produces a number of magazines for various audiences.  The flagship magazine carries the same moniker as the corporation. My question to you all is: Should a corporations logo be the same on the magazine as it is for the corporation, or should those two entities be separate, giving identity to both. I&rsquo;ve never seen a corporate logo being used as for a magazine logo,to mea it seems wrong on many levels. but the &ldquo;re-branding team&rdquo;  has issued a mandate saying it must be so along with only being able to use one color for the logo, which is teal. yep. teal. On the cover. Does this make sense to anyone? From an aesthetic point of view not to mention budget issues, there is a limited color palette for photos behind a teal logo, and when we rely on stock imagery at times for our covers, you can&rsquo;t specify a color palette. I have been charged with finding design answers to this question, as our thoughts (the corporate publication team) on the matter are viewed as insubstantial without some sort of backing from the design community.</p>
<p>any thoughts?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The question is how strong is the brand, do you believe that it has a strong following and can it help to sell your magazine. Are there any negative opinions towards your brand? If not then I would say using it to launch a magazine is a good idea in such a highly competitive market any help you can get is good.</div>
