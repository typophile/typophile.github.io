body: I would like to label some doors with letters. The idea I have is to have red
  circles with white sans serifs capitals in them. But that is not a must, I just
  want them to be well made and clear. I have looked for something that is pre-made
  like this but with not much luck so far. Maybe this is always a bespoke product.
  Still, I thought maybe someone here knows a good vendor that has nice pre made ones.
  Thanks!

    if you're doing a half-dozen, not if you're doing a hundred.\r\nWill they be indoors
    or outdoors? What material are the doors made of (wood/metal/glass)? Are they
    going in a public space where they need to be vandal- and theft-proof?  How long
    do they need to last? Affects your choice of materials, inks/paints, and method
    of attaching them to the doors. "

  body: 'All good points! The doors are inexpensive standard american painted lightweight
    wood laminate office doors. The are inside, not in the weather. They are the letters:
    A B C D E. I thought about hand lettering but in this context I think that like
    a UI on a web page fancy or interesting is not what is called for. In fact the
    opposite. I don''t think that vandalism is a big concern in this case. I think
    in some ways the ideal thing would be for them to be made from plastic or vitreous
    glass on metal. They should be simple and clean looking but not attention getting.
    Darrel, you are right. CNC may be the way it has to be. I will look a little more
    before deciding.'
