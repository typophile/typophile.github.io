body: "Hello! I've got a bit of dilemma on my hands. I'm currently the design editor
  of my university's student newspaper and for April 1st we're doing a joke issue
  with the theme \"time warp.\" Each page will be from a certain period in time, with
  the first page being the beginning of the universe (the leading cover choice right
  now is a blank page) and the last page will the end of it. All pages will be themed,
  with some modeled after illuminated manuscripts and others 1920s newspapers, for
  example.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm incredibly excited for this project, but the fonts have
  got me tripped up, specifically at the very beginning (cavemen and the discovery
  of fire) and the end (the far, far future). Anything after the start of movable
  type I'm fine with, obviously, because I can start to use Garamond and the like.
  But I'd like some ideas for the type before typography and into the future.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe
  main stickler here is readability - I can't do cave paintings (beyond as illustrations)
  for the beginning because the articles have to be readable. I've offered to hand
  write them, but that was shot down. I've suggested telling a story in symbols and
  having a fake researcher's note to the side as a translation, but that was also
  shot down as not keeping with the theme of the issue (which, loosely, is how a newspaper
  written from back them would have looked) and as being \"too high concept.\" So,
  a font, or at least a style of type is needed that goes with cave paintings.\r\n\r\nI'm
  also having the same problem for the future. (I think the times right now are 3000
  ACE, and 3,000,000 ACE, but it's not nailed down.) Just like how I can't use symbols
  or hieroglyphs, I can't use fonts like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Alphabet_%28typeface%29\">New
  Alphabet</a> because they can't be read easily. So far, I've gotten the suggestion
  of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/kettler/\">Kettler</a> and
  my boss seems okay with it. But that may only be because I told him it was okay
  at small sizes and as body text. A cliched version of the future will probably be
  what we go with because that will be most recognizable as \"future\" in the context
  of the issue.\r\n\r\nThere's also the issue of using faces suitable as body text.
  For example, the editorial page is going to fall in Roman times, and the masthead
  will be a play of Trajan's column. Trajan should be fine for names and the like,
  but setting the accompanying article in an all-caps face would be too much. So maybe
  Optima would be better? I've also got a few blackletter choices going (from the
  suggestions in The Elements of Typographic Style) that I hope to convince my boss
  are also readable.\r\n\r\nI'd like to stay \"accurate\" since the rest of paper
  will be (not going to use Baskerville until after 1757!) but accuracy is not possible
  before the written word. I'm grateful for any suggestions thrown my way!"

    a.k.a. miniscules, are a much later innovation. An all-caps typeface can work
    for body copy if you air it out, i.e., add extra leading.\r\n\r\nAnd pre-Common
    Era, are you going to set your articles in Greek or Phoenician or Cuneiform?"

    by saying that. \r\nYou can always have a Hieroglyphs/Cuneiform alphabet in the
    corner with the English letters under it, or as like a half page in the middle
    of the spread with the alphabet so it doesn't get in the way of the design...\r\nThen
    the page with be more interactive with the reader, maybe sparking more interest
    than normal? (just don't write too much)."
