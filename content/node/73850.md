  Normal Medium is very close]] but doesn't have the slants on the top of the \"L\"
  and \"I\". That could of course just be a customisation, but the \"O\" is also different
  (hard sides on CA normal). Futhermore, the \"C\" and \"R\" seem to have slightly
  different proportions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDylan"

  body: "To me that looks rather like Interstate (Regular Condensed), slightly squished
    vertically, and with the slanted tops on \"L\" and \"I\" potentially being a customization.
    Hmm.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Interstate/styles/"
