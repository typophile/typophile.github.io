  body: It's generally not recommended (in the FontForge manual at least)  to double-encode
    glyphs, but it certainly can be done and may indeed be the practical solution
    for a unicase or caps-only display font.

    can imagine a scenario wherein you select some text, apply your double-encoded
    font, and suddenly \"a\" is now \"A\" and you've lost case information in that
    text that doesn't come back if you then decide to change it to another font. But
    this is pure supposition."

  body: "On more or less the same subject, is there an advantage to handling unicase
    kerning one or the other of these two ways?\r\n\r\n1. Simply expand uppercase
    classes to include lowercase instances; e.g., A' Aacute Acircumflex Adieresis
    Agrave Aring Atilde Abreve Aogonek (plus) a aacute acircumflex adieresis agrave
    aring atilde abreve aogonek.\r\n\r\n2. In the past, I have...\r\n(a) exported
    uppercase only kerning, opened the .afm file and cut and pasted the kerning data
    into a simple text file;\r\n(b) opened the text file in Excel, specifying \"delimited\"
    with \"space\" as the delimiter;\r\n(c) made two copies of the kerning info;\r\n(d)
    run a macro to change the second column of uppercase letters into lowercase letters
    in the first copy, then done the same for both columns in the second copy;\r\n(e)
    pasted the altered info beneath the original, then saved the results as a .prn
    file;\r\n(f) pasted the .prn info into the original .afm file; then, finally\r\n(g)
    imported the metrics back into FontLab."

    embedded fonts potentially losing their Unicode information, in which case the
    glyph names could be used for proper glyph-to-character translation ... there's
    a more extended discussion in the FontLab manual under \"Advanced Naming and Encoding\"
    (p145).\r\n\r\nWorking with the copied glyphs isn't as big of an inconvenience
    if you're using classes for scripting as well as kerning (pretty much like Nick's
    suggestion #1 above), and using components for the copies. Rather than double-encoding
    the \"A\", make a named \"a\" glyph that's a component of \"A\" and create appropriate
    classes for every pair or series of similar glyphs. Then in your code, just refer
    to the classes."

  body: "There is nothing wrong with assigning multiple Unicode codepoints to single
    glyphs. There are lots of situations in which this is sensible and efficient.
    The TT/OT Unicode cmap subtables are designed to be able to handle this sort of
    thing.\r\n\r\nThe only caveats to be observed are:\r\n\r\n1. If a PDF is distilled
    from a print stream, it will not be possible for Acrobat to reconstruct the character
    string (for searching, copying/pasting text) unless there is a one-to-one relationship
    between correctly named glyphs and individual Unicode characters.\r\n\r\n2. It
    is not generally adviseable to encode the same glyph as characters from different
    writing systems, e.g. unifying the encoding of Latin a and Cyrillic \u0430, but
    only because it is easier to manage things like kerning and OpenType Layout if
    glyph sets for different scripts are kept separate."

  body: "@John Hudson,\r\n\r\nWith regards to your first caveat, this brings up a
    related issue which I find myself going back and forth on:\r\n\r\nThe fact that
    the unicode stream might be lost in PDFs seems to be the major argument against
    having OT features map from one character onto another (rather than onto a glyph
    variant). If one adheres rigorously to this, it can often result in a large amount
    of glyph duplication (e.g. many fonts will include separate sets of small caps
    for the 'smcp' and 'c2sc' features so that case is preserved in PDFs). While such
    duplication might not drastically increase the size of the font file, it can lead
    to an extremely cluttered font, and ins some cases greatly increases the complexity
    of coding (and thus the possibility of uncaught bugs) - for example, in cases
    where there are several, cumulative variants of the small capitals which must
    all be duplicated.\r\n\r\nAre there other reasons besides PDF-related issues which
    argue against having two different characters map to the same glyph (e.g. mapping
    both A and a to a single a.smcp glyph)? If not, how high is the percentage of
    PDFs created which fail to preserve the original character stream?\r\n\r\nHow
    rigorous are people out there when it comes to assuring that no two characters
    map onto a single glyph? For those who are not, how often do you run into problems
    as a result of this?\r\n\r\nWhile I use small capitals as my example above, I'm
    more interested in cases where more than case-sensitivity would be sacrificed.
    For example, mapping zero to U2070 (superscript zero) or s to U017F (long s) rather
    than creating a separate s.hist glyph.\r\n\r\nApart from the potential for bugs,
    lots of glyph duplication also results in an overly long glyph-palette which can
    frustrate the user looking for a particular glyph.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    to them, and then they decide whether this is important to them.\r\n\r\n<em>If
    not, how high is the percentage of PDFs created which fail to preserve the original
    character stream?</em>\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, it's any situation in which
    Acrobat is used to distil from a print stream, as opposed to an application using
    some kind of write-to-PDF function that makes use of PDF character string storage.
    \u2018Printing to PDF\u2019 sends only the glyph IDs for the embedded font(s)
    which then need to be mapped to glyph names in the font(s) in order for Acrobat
    to try to parse these and reconstruct the original text."
