  body: "NEON is Electrik (aka Eklektic). I can't find a reference for it anywhere
    online, but I have Eklektic on my machine. It came with CorelDraw, which means
    it's most likely from Bitstream.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: The bottom one is ITC Firenze I think, but it doesn't seem to be available
    in digital format (at least with that name).

  body: "Eklektic and Legerdemain are both digitizations of the old VGC typeface Elektrik
    (two k's) and either is about as legit a version as you are going to find.&nbsp;
    Eklektic came with my version of CorelDraw (8) as well.&nbsp; Eklektik has a Corel
    copyright,&nbsp; not BT,&nbsp; and Buyfonts is offering the old Fontbank fonts.\r\n\r\nFirenze
    ITC is bundled also on the same CD."

    is similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yes, Grant Hutchinson said that sort of thing was one reason they dropped
    a lot of the old Letterpress fonts -- they weren't up to current standards. Of
    course, I could make tracking corrections to reduce the more obvious problems,
    if we're just looking at a few words of type.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
