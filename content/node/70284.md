body: "Hi typophiles,\r\n\r\nrecently I stumbled across a Type-ID-topic which conclusion
  was Helvetica Rounded Bold Condensend and I thought what serif would match it. Instead
  of doing a exhausting research I took the oppotunity and started one by myself.
  And this changed into a project further than just adopting charasteristics of Helvetica
  Rounded Condensed but more into something with a own style. And this is the first
  result. \r\n\r\nPlease tell me what you think.\r\nIs it worth going on with it?\r\nIs
  it too close to something existing?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hel-rou-bol-con-ser_specimen1_4610.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance"
