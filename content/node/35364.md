  College of Communications, however they dont offer BA. Just wondering if anyone
  here would know of any infomations of schools in which I would be greatly exposed
  to letterpress, printmaking and so on..\r\n\r\nThanks,"

    dept. there, which, if you can get in with Nick (the technician) can be very beneficial.
    You also have the added bonus of Phil Baines and Catherine Dixon as tutors there.
    I recall a few years ago when LCC was LCP they were getting rid of a lot of letterpress,
    not sure where it went.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to learn letterpress at BA, you would
    have to probably take it up as a personal endeavour. A friend of mine did a lot
    of it on her BA at CSM, regardless of this, you'll have to also study every other
    area of the graphic arts like every other BA.\r\n\r\nPerhaps take a look outside
    of London. I know that The Cambridge School of Arts have letterpress.\r\n\r\nYou
    will probably find presses all over, but your best bet, and probably your best
    resource is London. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
