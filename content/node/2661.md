  body: MS Trebuchet is a very distinct face - regardless  <BR>if you like it or not
    - so it&#39;s pretty difficult to find an  <BR>acceptable match. Do you want to
    match principally  <BR>the uppercase or lowercase?

  body: 'If you look at <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage09.html" target="_blank">
    this page</a> in the Sans Serif Font ID Guide, you can see other styles with similar
    shape characteristics to Trebuchet: Agenda &#40;Font Bureau&#41;, Faceplate Sans
    &#40;Psy/Ops&#41;, Mahsuri Sans &#40;Agfa&#41;, Today Sans &#40;Spiece&#41;, Parisine
    Bold&#40;Agfa&#41;, and Projekt &#40;Linotype&#41;. Of course details will not
    match in each font, like the serif on the &#39;i&#39;, or the curved &#39;l&#39;,
    or the open lower bowl on the &#39;g&#39;.  <BR> <BR>However, finding an equivalent
    seems like an odd exercise for such a ubiquitous font. Doesn&#39;t Microsoft give
    it away?'

  body: <i>&#62; Yet another example of MS&#39;s ... oh, never mind.</i> <BR> <BR>Mike,
    what do you think was MS&#39;s rationale behind this  <BR>move? Do they really
    expect people will want to pay for  <BR>their copy of MS Trebuchet or &#60;gag&#62;
    Comic Sans? :/

  body: Sorry for the delay, Yves. <BR> <BR>Well, MS wants people to pay, not for
    the fonts per se, but for the <BR>program&#40;s&#41; that bundle the fonts. That
    was the main point put to <BR>me by an upper level MS Typography rep who actually
    replied to <BR>my e-mailed inquiry &#40;boy, was I surprised&#41;. <BR> <BR>Outside
    opinion, based partly on the timing, was that Linux users <BR>were being pointed
    to those fonts by many Linux resource sites <BR>and were grabbing them in very
    large numbers. <BR> <BR>Certainly it&#39;s MS&#39; right to do with the fonts
    what they choose, but <BR>increasingly they have been choosing to slap their customers
    <BR>upside the head. The user of a properly purchased MS application <BR>who has
    a font that has become corrupted cannot simply get a <BR>replacement off the installation
    CD. The fonts don&#39;t exist as indi- <BR>vidual files. <BR> <BR>Personally,
    I feel that, after making sure that Arial, TNR and, to a <BR>lesser extent, Verdana
    are specified in millions of HTML pages <BR>around the world, MS ought to make
    these fonts available to all. <BR> <BR>Of course, as Justin showed, the fonts
    are available elsewhere. <BR><br>
