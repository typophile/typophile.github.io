  to fill in negative space for a scrip or brush layout? Like are there any tips or
  do-and-don'ts of creation? I want to use some to add to my layout but i don't know
  where to begin or which ones to use if the font does not contain alternates or glyphs
  included in the original. Thanks in advance!
