  main interest is building loghouses. They import the wood from Russia and intend
  to erect the houses in Denmark mainly. Quality is excellent and the prices are low.
  &#40;In short: a very good deal&#41; <BR> <BR>Well, I could really use some creative
  inputs regarding the logoshape and the typography. I&#39;ve been through quite a
  bunch of ideas which I&#39;ve included here. I want to make a simple shape that&#39;s
  unique and remarkable which illustrates: quality and affordable loghouses - and
  good for the environment. <BR> <BR>Quite a hard task <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Should we assume that people who buy these houses want to be &#34;in touch
    with nature&#34; or something along that line? Do the houses look very &#34;loggy&#34;?
    <BR> <BR>BTW, if I buy some of that famous Danish furniture here in the US, are
    you telling me the wood actually comes from Russia?! ;-&#41; Hey, if Russian lumber
    is as good as Russian font software... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Out of the four ideas here I think the second is the most engaging. Luxury
    Loghouses? My grandfather lives in a machine made log house that was built on-site
    in Oregon USA which is very nice and that house in my mind goes best with number
    2 option. <BR> <BR>To my eye number 1 looks too obvious/American. Number 3 looks
    like an Interior design store or high end hardware store and number 4 looks like
    a lumber or paper company. <BR> <BR>Also the type in number one and 2 I prefer
    over 3 and 4. It looks modern but not <b>expected</b> so it is nicer. <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t have alternatives to suggest right now &#40;type or design&#41; I have
    to run for a train!  I&#39;ll look in again soon. Keep it up! <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: 'Jon, I think the typography in the first 2 say &#34;luxury&#34; more than
    the last 2. The illustration in #2 does not say &#34;luxury&#34; to me: it looks
    more like a mobile home. Assuming, as Hrant said, that the target audience wants
    some of that &#34;I live in nature&#34; experience, I think the logo in #4 might
    be on the right track. Maybe the two sides of the logo could be staggered a bit,
    so that they still suggest a tree but also suggest the interleaving of logs. &#40;The
    current form looks similar to both Boise-Cascade&#39;s and Weyerhauser&#39;s logos
    -- not good associations for your target market, I&#39;d guess.&#41; <BR> <BR>To
    my eye, the blue/green colors don&#39;t say &#34;luxury&#34; or &#34;nature&#34;
    -- they&#39;re a bit too saturated for that, I think. Something more earthy and
    dark might better communicate both &#34;nature/environment&#34; and &#34;high-quality.&#34;'

  body: My two bits.... <BR> <BR>Overall, I like the last two explorations  <BR> <BR>Logo#1
    uses a &#34;truss&#34; &#40;engineered rafter&#41; for the mark.  Most log homes
    that I have seen rely on a more traditional rafter &amp; beam construction

  body: 'Henrik, what you are hoping for &#40;with the logo&#41; is more than can
    be expected. Make a nice simple unique mark, and let the marketing department
    worry about creating the positioning of the product. Do you see your mark existing
    without a tagline or a photo of the luxury log houses, probably not. You might
    think of process to imply luxury &#40;gold stamping, blind embossing&#41;. Ask
    the marketing department for a profile of the average buyer, demographics. That
    might help you skew your mark towards that group. Just some thoughts '
