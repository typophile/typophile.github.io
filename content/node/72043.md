    the office and I have no photos. Will try to take some shots tomorrow.

    Historical Society Press. But I am not at home and won\u2019t have access to my
    references for a few more days. If I remember, I\u2019ll try to look up a specific
    title or two."

  body: "Well, unfortunately, the information I have from Will\u2019s samples only
    gives the title for one of the books: <em>A Gift of Light: Photographs in the
    Janos Scholz Collection</em>, edited by Stephen Roger Moriarty.\r\n\r\nBut, as
    I said, Will was a fan of Clifford (even called it a \u2018desert island\u2019
    face at one point), so I know there are other titles in the MHSPress catalog.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck."

  body: "Just thought of another resource. From a few past AAUP book show catalogs,
    here are a few titles. Can\u2019t vouch for these, as I haven\u2019t seen the
    books themselves; and most of these were cited for cover design, so I can\u2019t
    vouch for interiors. But a few titles to look up nonetheless.\r\n\r\n<em>Hard
    Road West</em> by Keith Heyer Meldahl\r\n<em>Victorian Popularizers of Science</em>
    by Bernard Lightman\r\n<em>Who Wrote the Book of Love?</em> by Lee Siegel\r\n<em>Cartographies
    of Travel and Navigation,</em> edited by John Akerman\r\n\r\nHmm. As it turns
    out, these are all published by University of Chicago Press. Looks like the folks
    at U of C Press are fond of Clifford as well, so you might check their catalog
    in general."

    in FF Clifford.\r\nOne is the [[http://reason.com/|Reason magazine]] art directed
    by Erik Spiekermann and the other book for kids explains ancient Roma titled Das
    alte Rom. I'm afraid I couldn't find the detail about author and publisher, I
    hope it would be helpful for you. \r\n\r\n[[http://akobayashi.exblog.jp/8610050/]]"
