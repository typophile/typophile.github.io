  used mainly in InDesign but also in Microsoft Word 2003 and 2010.\r\n\r\nI have
  the FontLab option turn ON to generate the non-OpenType kern table but for some
  reason Word is not \u201Cseeing\u201D the kerning. If I generate the font as TrueType
  or Type1 Word using the kerning just fine.\r\n\r\nWe have another font that is being
  used in exactly the same way and that one is fine.\r\n\r\nThe other oddity is that
  Word 2010 grays out all of its OpenType controls on the Font dialog for this problematic
  font. I\u2019m guessing the two are related but I\u2019m stuck as to what\u2019s
  going on.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKen\r\n"

    fonts containing CFF outlines are not supported by the 'kern' table and must use
    the 'GPOS' OpenType Layout table.\" Guess you're stuck  with TrueType-flavoured
    OpenType, then."

  body: "Hmmff is right! Thanks for the tid-bit! However, I have another font devised
    much the same way for which the kerning WORKS in Word 2003.\r\n\r\nBoth fonts
    are updates to other fonts. The one that works initially came from a TTF, the
    one that doesn't initially came from a Type1. Could there be something \"hiding\"
    that's causing one to work and one not?\r\n\r\nOy."

  body: "None too sure. If you have ttx (which requires Python), you could probably
    use that to dump the fonts to text and see what tables are there. It's possible,
    if short of likely, that the TTF child font has a remaining 'kern' table that
    never got thrown out. 'Course, there may be a checkmark somewhere deep inside
    the editor that lets it add a 'kern' table to a PS-flavoured OT font. Should be
    possible as long as there are some kerning pairs. 'kern' can only handle pairs,
    not classes, it seems.\r\n\r\nEdit: FontForge can do it. Surely the big names
    can sneak in a 'kern' table, too."

  body: "Thanks Theunis, but no, I don't think that's the problem. We do, indeed,
    have a liga feature in the font.\r\n\r\nT\xE9 Rowan, I have actually used TTX
    on the OTF to make sure that kern table was still there as that is what Word would
    use. It looked to me like it WAS there so I'm still perplexed as to why Word would
    not be applying the kerning.\r\n\r\nI did solve at least part of this. That being
    that Word 2010 was graying out its OpenType controls on the font dialog. I'm embarrassed
    to report that when Word 2010 opens a file created in an earlier version of Word
    by default it disables the OpenType features. In the Options, in the \"Advanced\"
    area, down at the bottom of the page is \"Layout options.\" In that humungous
    list is the option to disable OpenType features.\r\n\r\nIn the little investigating
    I've managed to do with Word 2010 it definitely treats files created in an earlier
    version significantly different than doing a new document. I have, for instance,
    a document created in an earlier version of Word in which I can get NO kerning
    to work. However, do a new file, use the same font, in the same size and Word
    uses the class kerning. I've not looked very far into this one as of yet.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again guys for the help.\r\n\r\nKen"

    one of the things that I would like to implement with my new LUV line (now a Registered
    Microsoft Vendor!) is a unique serial number for every font sold. Am I correct
    in assuming that this task could be accomplished at point of sale, simply by converting
    the font to XML, appending a ten-digit serial number to the Type 1 XUID field,
    converting the font back to OTF or TTF format, then delivering the finished product
    via download link? A separate database would, of course, tie the serial number
    to purchaser data.\r\n\r\nThen, there's the separate issue of dsig. It would be
    nice to offer digitally signed fonts, but the mechanics of how to implement this
    element escape me at the moment. Big surprise."
