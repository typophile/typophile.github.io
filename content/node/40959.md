  encodings of FF Kievit, but not the Cyrillic and other varieties as well. The latter
  is sold by Paratype, either through the FontFont or Paratype online stores. Where
  can I get the \"omnibus\" edition with all languages and styles? \r\n\r\nActually
  I have the same question regarding ITC Charter, as I get confused by its distribution
  by different vendors as well. Is this an issue of licensing, or of farming out the
  work to create all the localized glyphs?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nEnrico"

    not aware of any other \"varieties\" that would exist, in terms of character sets.
    \r\n\r\nAs for Charter, look at my post at\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/40431\r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    don't see an \xFCber package that combines eastern+western but I'd imagine they
    could help if you contacted them directly.\r\nPerhaps <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/user/103\">Mr
    Coles</a> may even show up to lend his hand."

  body: "Hi Enrico. FontShop does indeed sell every version of FF Kievit. Perhaps
    you missed a few because you were browsing our site with the non-Western fonts
    filter turned on. See the top of your search results page to see if that's the
    case, but <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=kievit&nw=1&site=d&num=100\">here's
    a list of all the FF Kievit packages</a>.\r\n\r\nTwardoch's recommendation is
    the best one. FF Kievit Pro includes all the multilingual character sets in a
    single, convenient OpenType font for each style.\r\n\r\nFor your future reference
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/opentype-fontfonts-and-the-languages-they-speak/\">here's
    a table of all the OpenType FontFonts and which languages they support</a>."
