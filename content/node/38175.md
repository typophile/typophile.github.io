body: "I recently posted a text file* to help people who want to quickly get a sense
  of how their font looks in a variety of languages.\r\nBut one of the people using
  it says they can't see all the glyphs. The format I uses windows linebreaks and
  Unicode 8 no BOM. I could have used just Unicode 8 or Unicode 16, or Unicode 16,
  No BOM, or Unicode 16 Little Endian, or Unicode 16 Little Endian, No BOM. \r\n\r\nAny
  idea what line break type is going to be most compatible - and perhaps more importantly
  what Unicode encoding is best & why?\r\n\r\n* The thread is here if you want to
  use the file or do a technical check:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/31399\r\n\r\nIt
  is also here in v1.2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    will need to guess the encoding or even worse: use the default. Make it an RTF
    and choose the encoding and everything will be fine.\r\n\r\n"

    OSX (10.4).\r\n<ul><li>TextEdit: When I open it with the default settings (\u2018Open
    files using automatic encoding detection\u2019), there are issues, i.e. <em>\xF8</em>
    in S\xF8rensen = <em>\u221A\u220F</em>, for example. Changing the preferences
    to \u2018Open files using UTF-8\u2018 helps.</li>\r\n<li>Similar with Safari.
    <em>\xF8</em> = <em>\xC3\xB8</em> Switching from \u2018Standard\u2019 to \u2018Unicode
    (UTF-8)\u2019 helps</li>\r\n<li>My favourite text editor, <a href=\"http://www.skti.org/skEdit_features.php\">skEdit</a>,
    gets it right in the first place. Its preferences say \u2018Open files with UTF-8\u2019</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nHope
    that is of use for somebody."

  body: I think UTF-8 enjoys broader support than 16-bit Unicode.  But Ralf is probably
    right in suggesting a format that can represent the encoding explicitly.

  body: "Thanks everybody. This was very helpful! \r\n\r\nI will fix some errors that
    have come to light and re-post v1.1 in 3 formats: TXT RTF & PDF.\r\n\r\nBy the
    way; TextEdit can be made to use 'Unicode UTF-8' also. But you have to make a
    change in the preferences. \r\n\r\nThe other thing which I neglected to say and
    may be useful to know is that to test for Lingala ( one of the languages ) you
    must have extended Latin -B support in the font being tested. I would like to
    add more languages like this over time. Maybe then I can group them by Latin,
    Latin A & Latin B. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

  body: The revised (v1.1) files are up. If people want the RTF they will have to
    email me until such a time as Typophile adds it as a supported file type in threads.
