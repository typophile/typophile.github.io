body: Okay, need some direction with this one. I need a typeface similar to the two
  I&#39;m displaying here. Here&#39;s the catch, the black grid backgrounds need to
  continue when a space is entered. Perhaps these do continue and the web site isn&#39;t
  correctly displaying it? If someone owns these particular typefaces maybe you can
  confirm or deny? <BR> <BR>Any help is highly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>

  body: I&#39;m wondering if that is a special keystroke character or is it indeed
    a space? Sorry to be so thorough, it&#39;s a special request from my creative
    director.
