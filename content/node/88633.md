body: Hello boys and girls, hope everyone is having good times. So... I'd like to
  buy a font as a present for a friend, but I don't know how to do it. It's my first
  time doing something like this. Do I buy the font like I'd buy for myself and then
  send it to them by e-mail. The font is from Font shop. THANKS!
