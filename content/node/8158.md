  body: which war? when you wrote &#34;early 20th century&#34; I think of the first
    world war. but your client is probably interested in the second? and are they
    thinking US or Europe? allies or central powers/axis?

  body: Good questions. I&#39;ve e-mailed her asking that she join us here. <BR> <BR>WWII
    ... her father was an editor at Faber&amp;Faber at that time. <BR> <BR>My first
    gut answer certainly Electra and possibly Caledonia. Fairfield as well, although
    I&#39;m not sure at the exact dates on this one. But those are all US designs.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;d just like to see all designs, US or EU, allies and central powers.
    More interesting.

  body: 'I used to have a number of books produced in England under the War Standards
    act. These are cheaply produced, and have flexible card covers: somewhere between
    a trade paperback and a hardcover book. Colour printing appears to have been limited
    also, since the books have very plain covers. Perhaps colour was reserved for
    specifically morale-boosting books. Interestingly, the cover typography of these
    books tends to be very plain and almost generic, as if the designers were keen
    to signal their commitment to wartime austerity measures even if it made no practical
    difference in the cost of production. War Standards book production in Britain
    continued for some time after the end of hostilities.'

  body: I just finished Michael Black&#39;s <i>Short History of the Cambridge University
    Press</i>, and he says &#40;at least I think it was there---I had to return the
    book to the library this morning!&#41; that CUP used Times New Roman so much because
    it was quite economical in setting, and given the post-war paper shortage, that
    was quite welcome.  <BR> <BR>Dan, Tschichold went to Penguin in 1947, so strictly
    speaking, it was after the war that he drafted their design guidelines.

  body: I&#39;m not sure what the practice was in England during the war, but in the
    US, &#34;Nazi-made types&#34; were banned by the Graphic Arts Forum, &#34;a group
    of democratically minded graphic arts and advertising people.&#34; The banned
    typefaces included Bauer Bodoni, Bernhard Modern, Eve, Futura, Kabel, Neuland,
    Trafton, and Weiss.  <BR> <BR>Sweet. <BR> <BR>Reference on this is _The Book Collector&#39;s
