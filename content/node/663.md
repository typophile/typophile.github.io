  body: I&#39;m going to go out on a limb here and say that this was done using one
    of the original Mac fonts, Athens, probably in an application like MacPaint or
    one of its derivatives, applying both the outline and shadow effects to it. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d go about finding Athens anymore, or a program
    that would duplicate this effect exactly. Regardless, the sample makes me feel
    like I&#39;m 14 again. Thanks for the memories.
