body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nI'm working on a personal project for a role playing game.
  \ The work isn't going to be resold, but I want a specific look and feel.  I found
  a font I like a lot, and was able to purchase a font that's very very similar in
  all but one (annoying) way.  The \"T\" in the font I purchased is larger than \"T\"
  in the original font.  \r\n\r\nI'm comfortable (though no expert) in several drawing
  programs, so I found a 30 day trial of Glyph for my mac and tried to make the modifications
  -- but frankly the software isn't something I'm comfortable with.  I tried (unsuccessfully)
  to find a contact method for the font's creator, but struck out there too.  I was
  wondering if someone could help me out by making the modifications for me?  I don't
  want to violate copyrights or anything like that -- I just know what I want and
  this is so close, but for this one thing.  I can provide an image of what I would
  like it to look like, and I'd be happy to buy you a copy of the font for your own
  collection.  Is this something someone could help me with? \r\n\r\nThanks so much
  in advance, \r\nBrennan\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hrant, \r\n\r\nHere's a link to a document showing the original:  \r\nhttp://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dysons_delve.pdf\r\nThe
    font in question is the one used for the title and section headers. \r\n\r\nThe
    font that's \"so close\" is shiver_me_timbers, created by Nick Curtis.  \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/shiver-me-timbers-nf/\r\n\r\nAs
    you can probably see, the \"T\" in the pdf document is in line with the rest of
    the characters and has a drop on the right side of the glyph.  In the SMT font,
    the \"T\" is taller than the other characters and flips upwards on the right hand
    side of the crossbar.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nBrennan\r\n"

  body: "For a one-off project, the easiest way to accomplish what you want is to
    convert the font to outlines in a drawing program and fiddle with the T until
    it looks like you want. If you attempt to modify the font itself\u2014which, under
    my EULA is permitted if the modification is solely for your personal use\u2014you
    will also have to modify the kerning for the font, which is based on the T looking
    exactly as it does."

    you bought the original. Satans Minions* (a PDF's \"Document Properties\" tells
    you what fonts were used) is an unauthorized clone, done by somebody else who
    was apparently miffed at the original \"T\".\r\n\r\n* http://www.dafont.com/satans-minions.font\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the guy right above is the original designer.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I wanted.  Hey, if Nick benefits from the unauthorized mod in this case, then
    the world is working the way it should.  Nick, thanks -- that's a great font you
    made and I'm happy to pay for it!\r\n\r\n(I know, right?  Someone happy to pay
    for work?  Could it be true??)\r\n\r\nThanks again, everyone!\r\n"

    really need to create a different font. Just create outlines of the words with
    the font you have and fix the T.
