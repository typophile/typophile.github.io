  <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/91109\">threads</a>, I've made a script that
  counts glyphs pairs, and lists them. I know it's been done <a href=http://www.volcanokit.com/volcanokit3/ligCounter/\">before</a>,
  however I wanted one with a little more flexibility. Unfortunately, because this
  is a shell script that uses old Unix tools like <code>grep</code>, there isn't really
  Unicode support. I'm going to have to rewrite it in something else in order to get
  that working better.\r\n\r\nSo here's some sample output. The first column is the
  glyph pair. Second column:  count in file. Third: percentage.\r\n<blockquote><pre>\r\nFirst

  the way, the file I used to run through this was the BSD <code>fortune</code> command
  run 5000 times (fortune.txt in the attachments), so some of it might seem odd. You'll
  also find output similar to the above with the first 40 pairs, and all pairs. The
  first attachment is the script itself.\r\n\r\nTo use the script, open up a terminal
  and <code>cd</code> to the directory you've put the script in. I haven't tested
  this on my Mac yet, but it should work. Note, the script require zsh and probably
  GNU coreutils. You'll want to change the name first. ('%' represents a prompt.)\r\n<code>%
  mv pairs.zsh.txt pairs.zsh</code>\r\n\r\nAnd make it executable:\r\n<code>% chmod
  +x pairs.zsh</code>\r\n\r\nFinally, to run it:\r\n<code>% ./pairs.zsh LENGTH FILE</code>\r\n(Where
  LENGTH is the length of pairs, and FILE is what you wish to run the script on.)"

  body: I don't think your script is counting right. Under 8 glyph "pairs," if "somethin"
    appears 126 times, shouldn't "omething" be tied with the same number?

  body: "You make a good point. I think it must be cutting off bits of words with
    the regular expression somehow. I'll try to fix that.\r\n\r\nI might think about
    trying to come up with a better term than \"pairs\" as well."

    the old reckoning listed <strong>e t a i n</strong> as the five most frequently

  body: Right, I didn't exactly choose the best text to mine this data from, just
    to test the script. Also, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency">Wikipedia</a>
    (not that Wikipedia is the best authority), the most used letters in English are
    <strong>e a i n o</strong>.
