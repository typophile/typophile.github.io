  body: "I too could not find Adonis.\r\n\r\nThe image is small scale so I don't know
    if this font has small serifs, like Copperplate, or is a plain sans.\r\nAssuming
    it's plain, there is a fairly close match in Silas Dilworth's design for Reservation
    Wide, a Type Trust Font:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/reservation-wide/\r\nThe
    only letter that is significantly different from the image is capital G, which
    could easily be edited to replace the bar with a curve.\r\nDon\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ReservationWideTypeTrust_6395.jpg]"
