  You almost have a 'b', and once you have a 'b' you have 'd,' 'p,' and  'q.'  That's
  about 1/3 of the lowercase alphabet from two characters.\r\n\r\nWhen type design
  started of course this wasn't really the case, you could say you had the design
  for all these letters based on the h and the b, but you still had to carve the shapes
  out of metal by hand anyway.  Today, we can simply copy, paste, rotate and flip
  in an illustration program or in fontlab.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a cheat though doesn't
  it?  And anyway it seems that to make things more legible, at least to dyslexics,
  you want these characters to have differences.  Now, not everybody is dyslexic,
  but I would argue that in some way, what makes things more legible to dyslexics,
  makes them more legible to everyone else as well.\r\n\r\nSo you make them different,
  because its better, and because its boring not to, and because you don't want to
  feel like you're cheating.\r\n\r\nI started off trying to make all my fonts perfect.
  \ Perfection was the goal.  Oh I was so enamored by the idea that type design is
  at the same time BOTH so right brain AND so left brain.  Science! Everything as
  similar to everything else as possible.  Measurements! The exact same bowl on all
  the bowled characters.  The w should look as wide in the uppercase as it does in
  lowercase.  This gives a better visual repetition.  It looks better.  The text becomes
  a more beautiful pattern.  But, does it read better?  More important to me, would
  it still possess character?\r\n\r\nBy making the letters more similar to each other,
  more perfect, perhaps what I was really doing is making the whole thing more boring.\r\n\r\nThe
  quirky bowl of the lowercase p was changed to match the bowl of the q.  Now it looks
  more legitimate, more serious...  Or does it?  Maybe it is just more boring. the
  exact left brain nature of science and logical thinking may not have been quite
  as important as I would have hoped...\r\n\r\nSo then I started working to make all
  the glyphs as different as possible.  To head in the other direction from perfection
  -- entropy.\r\n\r\nNow everything is different.  The set doesn't look like it belongs
  together.  The x height is all the same, the baseline is observed religiously, but
  still these characters don't look like they belong together.\r\n\r\nSo I head back
  in the other direction, taking little bits and pieces and copy and pasting them
  into other glyphs, trying to make them look more related.  But is it what I am really
  doing just making the font lose all its character?\r\n\r\nThere is no end to this
  story, no nice neat moral waiting for us at the end. \r\n\r\nI hope to start a conversation
  about these ideas which are probably more important in type design than in any other
  art.  I'm sure anyone who has been at it for awhile has had to deal with these issues
  and may like to impart some wisdom."

    of the Display-Text axis, with any font falling somewhere in between the two non-existent
    extremes. But there's also a threshold, somewhere on the axis.\r\n\r\nBTW many
    punchcutters \"cheated\" too, by using counterpunches.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
