  body: "I don't think you can expect digital fonts to relate to something that was
    not only pre-digital, but is not even made using metal type. The lettering looks
    like the sort that was done from a template, similar to a Leroy Lettering Guide.
    Similar devices are used today to make the lettering on license frames, but my
    point is that not all lettering can be connected to digital fonts.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    maybe someone can suggest a good 'faux-Leroy lettering' font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    which are based on similar template lettering, will get you pretty close.
