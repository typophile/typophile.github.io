body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI wonder what the expertes suggestions might be: \r\nLet\u2019s
  say a bank gets a a new owner and plans to have a new corporate design: more friendly,
  more contemporary. They used a customized Futura so far and everything was quite
  the same for more than 15 years. As there will be a lot of different publications,
  a big Type-Family like Corpid or Corporate would propably be a good choice because
  of flexibility. But is there another suggestion? Especially concerning friendliness
  and contemporary feeling? Or maybe it is better to have a face that conveys those
  values for the display-sizes (headlines, advertisments, posters), and have a more
  neutral sans-companion for all the rest ...\r\nAny suggestions /font-names are welcome.
  \  \r\nThank you for your ideas, I really appreciate this forum. \r\n\r\nanton"

    and body types, <a href=http://underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=underware&id2=case-studies&id3=01&idpic=05>here's</a>
    an example of a bank choosing to use a typeface in every application -- and I
    think it was a fantastic solution. I believe that Citibank uses Interstate in
    this manner, too.\r\n\r\nOne wide-ranging type family I can think of is <a href=http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/>Fedra</a>,
    which comes in sans, serif, and display varieties <em>and</em> a monospaced version,
    which means that it could be used on automatically generated papers, too.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    take a look at the suggestions <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/17684>here</a>."

  body: "Thank you for answering. \r\n\r\nclauses: I suppose the bank will customize
    the font any way, they did this with the old font, too. \r\nauricfuzz: sauna is
    a clever choice and a good signal for easy  and accessible online banking without
    the usual bank fuss. But didn\u2019t  JYSKE BANK go only half the way, as their
    logo is still very classical and serious? They are sending out two different signals,
    it seems to me. \r\nThanks for the link, too.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about any
    of the following: \r\n\r\nvista\r\nversa\r\nsansa\r\nneue sans\r\nleitura\r\nabsara\r\nlegato\r\nklavika\r\nkievit\r\n"

  body: "A quick rundown:\r\n\r\nvista - maybe not so bad, but a little bit too display'y\r\nversa
    - too old fashioned\r\nsansa - too rough'n'tuff for a bank\r\nneue sans - too
    generic for branding\r\nleitura - again too generic\r\nabsara - too bizarre for
    a bank\r\nlegato - again too old fashioned\r\nklavika - more contemporary and
    visible, but perhaps too cold\r\nkievit - again too generic and old fashioned\r\n\r\nWhy
    not something whit a little more charcter (in general)? The face should be recognizable
    and unique to the bank. Also the friendly roundness is not really found in your
    examples, and Sauna is spoken for...\r\n\r\nHave a look at http://www.fontpartners.com/
    FP Dancer might be what you're looking for."
