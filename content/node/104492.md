  body: "Hi, I can't say for sure because it's an old picture, but there are a number
    of wood cuts that have some of those same characteristics. Knockout by H&FJ seems
    to be the closest as it has multiple widths. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/overview/\r\n\r\nIf
    spending $800 on a family isn't in your budget, The League of Movable type has
    a similar (but less comprehensive) version for free.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot 2013-07-10 at 10_5802.02.03
