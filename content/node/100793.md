body: when choosing a typeface for body copy, do you check certain glyphs against
  each other, as a matter of habit? e.g.  "iIl1 0O".

  body: Only if the nature of the work would cause confusion among similar letterforms.
    In fiction, for example, the context usually makes things clear, with no confusion.
    Technical writing, or anything that contains non-words or mixed numbers and letters,
    requires such concern.

    had a foot serif on the \"l\". which gets me thinking, what's the idea behind
    creating letterforms that are so similar? it seems like a terrible idea on the
    face of it (excuse the pun).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gill-sans-johnston_5234.jpg]"

  body: "Many typewriters didn't have a numeral 'one' or an exclamation mark. You
    used the lower case \"L\" for one, and and apostrophe-backspace-period for an
    exclamation mark. Zero-Oh is an ongoing problem, as are all ambiguities for keyboarding
    programming languages, where the difference between the right and wrong character
    is the difference between success and failure. But as stated before, in plain
    text the ambiguities are usually self-evident from the context, and the type designers
    don't have to downplay their aesthetics.\r\n\r\nBut overall, you're absolutely
    right. It's a stupid idea to have different characters have the same glyphs!"

  body: "Yes, \r\nbut let's remember that's a very old story - the originally \"dotless
    small letter i\" got it's dot just to make a difference in between \"small letter
    ms & ns\". Life is ambiguous! Or not\u2026"

  body: 'I l and 1 end up looking very similar in many sans serif types because the
    designer is looking for a particular clean aesthetic in the appearance of text,
    which is disrupted by the introduction of features that would differentiate these
    letters, such as putting a tail on the l or bars on the I. [BTW, I''ve come to
    the conclusion that the latter is entirely legitimate in a sans serif design,
    and the bars do not consitute serifs: the barred form of I is an ancient variant
    of this letter found in many forms of writing independent of the presence or absence
    of serifs.]'

  body: "for signage, yes I do. and also narrow apertures that could cause 'a' 'c'
    and 'e' to be confusable with 'o'.\r\n \r\n Otherwise, the ambiguity hardly ever
    matters in the context of actual words."
