  my blog, but i can't - it has no cyrillic symbols.\r\nCan you advise me something
  similar to this great font, but with cyrillic symbols?\r\n\r\nThx."

  body: "PT serif? It is also at the Google font dir.\r\n\r\nIf you really want Volkhorn
    - and it sounds like you do - get together with others who want the same thing.
    With enough people you will likely be able to get Friedrich Althausen to make
    it for you. Or if he is too busy you could hire someone else to do it since it
    is an open source project.\r\n\r\nI am making Meriweather for the Google Font
    Directory. If someone offers me funding to make the Cyrillic I will end up making
    it sooner. If it isn't funded it will still be made in time. But when it is it
    will be a license-able font rather than a free one. "

  body: '"better" is such a subjective term. From what <em>I</em> can see, Vollkorn
    is not made nearly as well as Minion. Perhaps you mean "better" for your needs?
    Tell us more about what you like in Vollkorn so we can find a good alternative.'
