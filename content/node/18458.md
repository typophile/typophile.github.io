body: "Dear forum members,\r\n\r\nI have a question about the critique section: I've
  been working on my Font Sofa/Canap\xE9/Divan for a while now, it's an organic serif,
  so it belongs to the serif-section.\r\n\r\nNow I am working on an italic version
  of it. It's also serifed, but should I put it into the same thread, or create a
  new one, and give some linking for orientation?\r\n\r\nAnd: I also have a sans serif-version,
  and here things start to become complicated :) Sans-section and cross-linking? Same
  thread as Serif-Version?\r\nWhat about italic for sans serif? What about bold versions
  to come?\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way for viewers who want to have an overview and
  give comments?\r\nProvide them a common PDF?\r\nCross-linking between threads?\r\nEverything
  in one thread?\r\nSeperate Sans and Serif, but not roman, italic and bold?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your advise\r\nSebilar"

  body: Do whatever you want :) Sometime crituque threads get a little long, so it
    might not hurt to put them in separate threads. I like the cross linking idea.
    That being said, there would be nothing wrong with one big thread that shows everything
    together. It might help to show the relationships between family members. As to
    where a serif/sans family thread should go. You've got me there.
