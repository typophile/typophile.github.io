  letters on it. The business no longer exists, but I'm guessing from the building
  itself and the style of type (and my knowledge of the area), that it's from the
  50s or 60s. I thought it would be fun to extrapolate an entire character set from
  the limited characters on the sign (see attached). The typeface is definitely in
  the Neutra/Avenir/Futura/Gotham area, but it's the ampersand that really sets it
  apart. I wasn't able to identify the original typeface, and  the ampersand isn't
  like anything I've seen.\r\n\r\nSo here's my first attempt. To me, the uppercase
  looks pretty cohesive, and the lowercase is getting there. As far as the numbers
  go, I know my 5 and 8 still need a lot of work.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    espeially, R is a bit different but not a lot.\r\n\r\nThe upperase letters are
    coming out quite well, if Mauer Sans oould be onidered a close relative of Neuzeit
    Grotesk then 1, 3, u and y should be designed differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, the uppercase is definitely similar to Neuzeit.\r\n\r\nI wasn't planning
    this to be a relative, so I'd rather it be judged as its own thing. I'll be posting
    an update soon, but in the meantime, any critiques are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "Hi Jonathan,\r\n\r\nThe Mauer Sans capital \u2018O\u2019 looks as if the
    top and bottom curves are squashed towards the center, maybe make it more Evenly
    Circular  like O 1, O 2 or O 3. Similar treatment should be done on B, C, D, G,
    J, P, Q, S and U.\r\n\r\nIt is going to become quite nice after some fine tuning.\r\n\r\nBoris\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MSCapOs_4890.png]"

    -- the original design that's the basis for the new font may have some issues
    that need to be addressed (I've already made the M narrower. The original looked
    great as signage with lots of space around it, but seemed too wide when other
    letters were nearby.\r\n\r\nI'll hopefully have an updated version up soon.\r\n\r\nthanks!"
