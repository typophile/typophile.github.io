body: Can anyone help me identify this font from WWII? It's from the Army Air Forces
  Flexible Gunnery School - Tyndall Field, Florida. Circa 1943. Closest I've come
  is Radiant Condensed Medium but I've seen nothing with the oversized ascenders and
  descenders and the straight g descenders.

  body: "\r\nthank you, Bert. That's what I suspected but hoped to find something
    close. So thank you oldnick - it's got everything I need - except for the \"g\"
    now that I'm used to no loop on the descender. But it will definitely work."
