  body: "<strong>An interesting Olympic Tale</strong> (somewhat brief but very true)\r\n\r\nI
    was having a casual conversation with a few Compugraphic/Agfa country managers
    during DRUPA 88 in D\xFCsseldorf, when Sr. Benet, the Cg manager for Spain mentioned
    that Barcelona was to host the 1992 Olympics. He had heard that the design committee
    was interested in using ITC Barcelona for obvious reasons, and I said, \"like
    hell.\"\r\n\r\nAt that point, with the blessing of Agfa's senior management, I
    started an effort to have a custom type family created for exclusive use by COOB92
    (Organizing Committee for Barcelona Olympics 92) for all branding, official communications,
    press releases, signage/wayfinding systems, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of meetings
    and proposals, COOB92 (the hosting country's Olympic Committee bears these responsibilities)
    agreed that Agfa-Compugraphic (as it was officially named then) could develop
    and have exclusive distribution rights for an official and unique typeface for
    the Barcelona 92 Olympics. In return, Agfa-Cg would pay a fee of $1.3 million
    to COOB92 to become an official sponsor. The main proviso (there were more small
    print and minor provisions to the agreement) was that the NAME and BRAND of AGFA
    could not be used or displayed because that would violate provisions of one of
    their biggest sponsors -- Kodak.\r\n\r\nI was able to justify the $1.3 million
    sponsorship fee to my management since the global PR and subsequent sales of fonts
    and typesetting equipment (high-end machines were still proprietary) would offset
    the expense. (Business, business, money, money.)\r\n\r\nI was then able to officially
    meet with the designated Olympic design team, Quod Dise&#241;o y Marketing, S.A.,
    and began working with Josep Maria Trias and Geordi Mantegna on their requirements
    for a custom type design. Since originally ITC Barcelona was one of several designs
    being considered for the wordmark, they were open to my suggestion to view new
    design sketches by Ed Benguiat.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Catalan_2.png]<em>Very
    early sketches of medium with italics</em>\r\n\r\nAfter many months and several
    trips to Barcelona, Ed Benguiat and I finally presented a design that Trias felt
    could work. Several months later, an official press meeting was held in Paris
    to announce that <em>Catalana</em> would become the official type family for the
    1992 Barcelona Summer Olympic Games. (The official announcement of the Rotis type
    family by Otl Aicher was also announced to the international press.)\r\n\r\nShortly
    after all the PR, Agfa announced that Compugraphic, now wholly owned by Agfa,
    would now be named simply AGFA.\r\n\r\nThis violated the proviso of the Olympic
    sponsorship since Kodak was to be the ONLY film company sponsor, and their sponsorship
    fee was a whole heck larger than the $1.3 million we were coughing up. Also, it
    was a perfect excuse for Agfa to withdraw from the committed fee, since by then,
    proprietary sale of equipment and fonts were dwindling and the sale of a single
    type family in PostScript fonts was not enough to offset the expense.\r\n\r\nJosep
    Maria Trias, who was not completely enamored with the <em>Catalana</em> design,
    opted to use Times New Roman for all branding instead, since he felt it was <em>a
    timeless classic and widely accepted</em> (yikes!).\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Adios Catalana</em></strong>\r\n\r\n"
