body: I&#39;ve been taking graphic design at Parsons and want to apply for a masters,
  preferably in the NY area. Does anyone have any experience or suggestions regarding
  the MFA graphic design programs at Pratt, Yale, and SVA? &#40;and any other schools
  you would recommend.&#41; How are the teachers? Is the program more theoretical
  or is it practical? What are the students like &#40;supportive? nasty? drugged out?...etc&#41;?
  And does the school have a good hit ratio in the job market? Any help greatly appreciated!!!!!
