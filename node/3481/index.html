		<div class="commentbody">&gt;the intended average point size of usage <BR> <BR>But in practice that will vary: <BR> <BR>In my experience designing ads, flyers, and marketing newsletters, the Registered symbol is used in body text (size 8 - 14 pt) as a superscript to a brand name.  <BR> <BR>Then it is repeated in a footnote (with the name of the owner of the brand) as small as possible, (4 - 6 pt).  <BR> <BR>I always prefer it when fonts have a cap-height Registered symbol, because it is easy to &quot;superscript&quot; the symbol in the body copy, but very difficult to increase the size of a pre-shrunk symbol in the footnote and not have it look too bold and misaligned vertically. If you just set it straight, it's but a speck. <BR> <BR>That's why I make cap height Reg symbols in the fonts I design, unless they are outright display faces. <BR> <BR>However, I seem to be going against the flow here, so I would like to confirm with typographers:  <BR>Do you prefer a pre-shrunk Registered symbol in your text fonts? <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Another thing to consider is the weight problem. I almost always go up one weight (if possible) when I use a super-shift version of the TM or R. Perhaps if you choose to go with the full-size method, you can increase the weight a bit?

		<div class="commentbody"><i>How far should the mark match the style of the typeface &ndash; in particular, why do most italic fonts have roman marks?</i>  <BR> <BR>The answer, as always, is: it depends. <BR> <BR>I have strongly suspected that some sloppy font producers throw in a generic humanist &quot;r-ball&quot; or &quot;tm&quot; on any font they create. To me, it's an obvious error if the R in the registration mark doesn't bear a strong resemblance to the R in the typeface it &quot;modifies.&quot;  <BR> <BR>The &quot;depends&quot; part deals with condensing and/or obliqueing the circle along with the R inside the circle. That's just wrong! Keep the circle round. Then condense or oblique (if you have to, but you really should re-draw) the R within the circle. <BR> <BR>Of course, after I've gone through the process of doing all that, the effect can be so distracting that I throw the end product out and default to the roman registration mark. Italic Rs within a circle sometimes look silly. Italic TMs sometimes look silly. <b>Avoid silly.</b> <BR> <BR>Thomas, I agree with Gerald &ndash; providing alternate versions is a great solution &ndash; I'd be tempted to provide a version set at x-height as well.  <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good one, Hrant! <BR> <BR>Kris, I work at Target (<a href="http://www.target.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.target.com">www.target.com</a></a>), which I call Gigantacorp. After spending 25 years in small craft shops of less than 30 employees, the switch to a Global Tetrahedonic-size employer is a shock for me. It's no secret; it's in my e-mail addy. It does, however, make my work experience different from that of most typophiles, I think. Who else would come up with &quot;R-balls&quot;?</div>

Are there other major companies that have typography departments? (Aside from software companies (Apple, Microsoft) and output companies (Epson, Agfa, etc.)?

		<div class="commentbody">Haha. <BR> <BR>I was inspired by Shel Silverstein (I think it was (if it wasn't I can't pretend to know whom it might have been (someone will correct me if it's not))) who wrote an entire short story/poem with nested parenthesis (not brackets (I think he was going for a visual effect (or better yet, maybe he was going for a cognitive overload (for the reader, not for himself))) which would change the overall texture). It was great. (I'm sure he probably drove his proof readers mad. (Who wants a dagger now?)) <BR> <BR>(This makes for a great way to write a stream of conscience without having to stop to make it all grammatically nice.) <BR> <BR>(Isn't someone going to call &quot;off topic&quot; soon?) <BR> <BR>(Who was it that said you can skip anything written in parenthesis?)</div>
