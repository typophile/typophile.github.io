body: "I'm looking for suggestions for a font that works well at very small point
  sizes (probably 6 pt.).\r\n\r\nI'm laying out the back side of a 3 disc various
  artist CD compilation with 74 tracks and artist names, so there is a quite a bit
  of text for a small space.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I've set the track listing in Egyptienne
  F, but I'm looking for other suggestions. The font of the case uses Block Berthold
  for the title, so something that works well with Block would be nice, but I'm not
  sure if that font will appear on the back cover or not. \r\n\r\nthanks!"
