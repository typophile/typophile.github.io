  students and Mr. and Mrs. Desktop Publisher always do with type. You know, putting
  2 spaces between sentences, using dumb quotes instead of smart quotes, etc. Well,
  in an effort to educate the public (or at least entertain those of us who know better),
  I have designed a poster with 34 typographic sins that I hope people don't commit.
  Some, like those mentioned above are obvious, others are a little more obscure.
  I letterpressed my poster at <a href=\"http://www.rowleypress.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rowley
  Press</a> and you can purchase them on my web site: <a href=\"http://www.jimgodfreydesign.com\"
  target=_blank\">jimgodfreydesign.com</a>. \r\n\r\n<strong>Save the typographic soul
  of a loved one, or your own.</strong>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeSins_closeUp02_6195.jpg]"

    print, it is not. The type is defined in ems, however, so if you want to set your
    default type to a smaller size, that eliminates most of the rivers. :)"

    too early.

    more choice. Hanging punctuation can have its place."
