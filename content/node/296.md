    <BR>I think Blake was specifically looking for &#42;double  <BR>accents&#42; rather
    than the umlaut. unfortunately, I don&#39;t  <BR>know of any standard character
    that fits the bill -- it  <BR>appears that no one else does either. <BR> <BR>if
    you can&#39;t find what you need in an OpenType font,  <BR>you may have to assemble
    it from two individual  <BR>accents and an O. if you are using this character  <BR>extensively,
    I would suggest doing the work in a font  <BR>editor and mapping it as you see
    fit.

  body: The Hungarian umlaut is a part of the standard  <BR>Macintosh character set
    and is accessed through the  <BR>shift-option-g keystroke. <BR> <BR>None of the
    composite characters with this accent are  <BR>part of a standard font, however.  <BR>
    <BR>You can set the &#39;o&#39; followed by the accent and then  <BR>kern the
    accent back over the o. If you are using Quark  <BR>with the Kern-Track Editor
    xtension loaded, then you  <BR>can build your own custom kern pair that will alleviate  <BR>the
    tedium of manually kerning each time. <BR> <BR>HTH <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>
