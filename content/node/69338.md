    the C has been altered. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/semibold/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D61%26w%3D720%26src%3DMICHAEL%2520KOR%26text%3DMICHAEL%2520KORS%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3D%26seed%3D42|Proxima
    Nova]] semibold gets you pretty close.

    Most Popular Fashion Brand Logos]] as I was unable to find a high quality one
    over Internet. And the most suitable font I found for it was \"Helvetica ce 55
