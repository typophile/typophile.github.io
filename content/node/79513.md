  (See attached image)\r\n\r\nSpecifically the one used for the \"88\" and \"ROCKET
  HYDRA-MATIC!\"\r\n\r\nI have searched everywhere I could think of...\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nReinhardt"

  body: I'd be inclined to say that its Univers Extra Condensed Italic, but Univers
    was released in 1957, and the car appears to be a 1954 to 1956 model...

  body: "Hi oldnick, Thank you for your reply!\r\n\r\nYes it seems Univers is a very
    close match, but alas... The model is a \"1950 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 2 Door Hardtop\"
    and the quotation marks on Univers differs from the typeface in the advert.\r\n\r\nHeadline
    Gothic seems a good match as well (though very late, 1995), but Univers is the
    winner so far.\r\n\r\nLook at this link for instance, there appears to be minor
    differences throughout, so it cant be Univers...\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/autohistorian/3971168200/"

  body: "I wouldn't be surprised if it was hand-lettered. Film or process lettering
    is another possibility. I've checked specimen books for Photo-Lettering, Filmotype,
    and Lettering Inc. All of them had similar styles, but unfortunately none matches
    exactly.\r\n\r\n(Coincidentally, the closest match from Filmotype, \"Escort\",
    is being digitized and will probably be released soon. I'm not the one working
    on it and not involved in release schedules, so I don't know exactly how soon.)"

    \r\nThat's what I was going to say. It looks like something you'd find in the
    pages of Mortimer Leach's book <em>Lettering for Advertising</em> (1956). "
