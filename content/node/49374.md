body: "In typographic circles, old-style figures (OSF) are generally preferred over
  lining figures (LF) for body text because they integrate better with lowercase letters.
  There seems to be a trend of returning to typographic elegance, so to speak, with
  many of the newly designed digital fonts having OSF as the default.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  there are certain fields where the use of OSF may not be appropriate. Zivatar, a
  lawyer, has asserted that OSF are not suitable for legal writing on a number of
  occasions, in the following threads:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/49288\">Typography
  for Lawyers</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/37541\">Advice for legal
  pleadings</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/41921\">Typefaces for use in
  legal practice</a>\r\n\r\nI invite people to comment on whether there are certain
  fields where one should be using LF instead of OSF, and what the reasons are. While
  it certainly makes sense to me that LF is better for certain technical fields of
  writing, I would still like to hear the rationale.\r\n\r\nFor mathematical writing,
  for instance, LF would be strongly preferred over OSF. One sees mathematical texts
  using LF not long after the introduction of LF to the typographic palette, such
  as 1822's <em><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=VeQGAAAAYAAJ&printsec=toc&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0\">An
  Introduction to the Elements of Algebra</a></em>. I do not remember seeing any mathematical
  texts from the last century using OSF.\r\n\r\nI would venture there must be a few
  reasons beyond tradition and familiarity for this. For example, one frequently sees
  multiple levels of super- or subscripting in mathematical writing, and the alignment
  will be difficult to keep track of for OSF. Consider the following, where the expression
  on the left is meant to represent Exp(38). Because OSF are used, there is a chance
  it might be read as Exp(3^8), the expression on the right, especially by readers
  who are used to seeing LF in mathematical texts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exp38_5745.gif]\r\n\r\nAlso,
  a LF zero is less likely to be confused with the letter o, which is used in the
  'little o notation', for example.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think about this issue?
  Are there other fields where LF may be preferred to OSF? What are the advantages
  and disadvantages each of these types of numerals provides for different fields
  of writing?"

  body: "Yes, I thought I'd regret saying that I don't remember mathematical texts
    from the last century using OSF. I remember seeing that thread; I must have forgotten
    about it. I'd like to see more of that book and see if it uses multiple levels
    of super- or subscripting where OSF can cause confusion.\r\n\r\nOf course, all
    mathematical texts used OSF up till the late 18th century or so when LF were introduced,
    and a lot of those were beautifully designed. So I probably shouldn't say OSF
    should never be used for mathematical texts. But as a reader of mathematical texts,
    I think I would strongly prefer to read those set with LF. I guess I'm still struggling
    to verbalize why OSF with mathematical texts are so distracting to me. Maybe in
    mathematical texts the goal is to set the numbers more apart from the surrounding
    text rather than harmonize them, the same reason variables represented with letters
    are italicized.\r\n\r\nThe OSF in the number tables of Nick's thread don't bother
    me at all. But when the OSF numbers are used alongside the text, they are somewhat
    distracting."

    an audiance, not a vacuum. Transfer your question to music. Is the pentatonic
    scale better or worse than the heptatonic scale for some uses? Of course: It wouldn't
    be *real* Blues if you use the heptatonic scale.\r\n\r\nAudience expectations
    count, and need no further justification."

  body: "Today, using old style figures is nearly nowhere seen in mathematics publication,
    but Gauthier-Villars, which was one of the main publisher of mathematical content
    in France up until something like the late 1950's, used a Didot typeface with
    old style numbers at normal size and lining figures in exponents. Here's a sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gauthiervillars_oldstylenum_3451.png]\r\n\r\n(This
    sample is from the <em>Formulaire pour le calcul symbolique</em> by Mc Lachlan
    and Humbert, edited and printed by Gauthier-Villars in 1941.)\r\n\r\nConcerning
    suitability, confusion between an old-style zero and a lowercase O is more academic
    than anything else, as the context will make it clear which is which. I would
    be more concerned about the confusion between an old-style 1 and a capital I,
    especially if they appear in fractions (e.g. a display fraction with a 1 and a
    small piece fraction with a I)."

    just sloppyness, or intention. They do have a more commanding presence though,
    and numbers in a newspaper article often benefits from standing out: e.g. the
    size of things is often very important in tabloids. Tabloids also have a more
    widespread use of bold than books do. They generely don\u2019t invite long stretch
