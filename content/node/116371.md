  alternative for Gotham. When I put some headers in a light weight, I get the feeling
  there's a bit of \"warping\" going on, so I guess there's no screen hinting apparent.
  First of all, I thought every Google font was a webfont, and thus adjusted for that
  particular use... but is that true? Or is it just about .woff-files that are not
  neccesarily hinted for screen usage?\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I altered the Raleway font through
  Glyphs to change the weird-looking W and w to its alternative neighbors (changing
  ASCII-codes and removing the standard ones). This was done with ttf-files, which
  I downloaded straight from the Google Fonts website. So I'm not sure whether there's
  a difference in the file types you download and those that are used directly via
  CSS.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nElpee\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Hi Laurens.\r\n\r\nIf you modify a TrueType font, most often the hints are
    lost. It sounds like that might be what happened in your case. From what I\u2019ve
    read, Google Fonts usually use autohinting. It should be no problem running your
    font through an autohinter again after the modifications. \r\n\r\nOl\u2019 geezers
    like myself prefer manual hinting, but it takes time and cost money if you have
    to pay someone for that time. "
