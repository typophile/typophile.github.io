  body: "Thanks, Chris. But I could not laugh. Maybe, because I have to turn off the
    sound, because I understand German.\r\n\r\nI could laugh about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK6VySzddPY\">this
    not type related Hitler parody</a> (but only, because I understand German.)"

  body: I guess you are right, if you understand German then you just ignore the subtitles.  When
    I watch an Opera that has been translated into "English", supposedly for my benefit,
    I always think it sounds stupid and contrived. "Che gelida manina" should not
    sound like a poorly phrased American country song :-)
