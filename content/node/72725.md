body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am looking for a sans-serif typeface to match Papyrus (not
  my choice - I loathe that font). It will be used on a website, for menu headings
  and also body text. Even a suggestion of what characteristics would match would
  be helpful- humanist, geometric, grotesque etc. The website is for a horror/thriller
  film, if that is any help on choosing a font.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to any recommendations
  to solve this conundrum!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDavid"
