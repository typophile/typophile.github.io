  body: "With this method, you only get the set of common elements, a blurred area,
    while the lettershapes should be rather interpolated.\r\n\r\nBelow: interpolation
    vs composition (blurred and tresholded to match the interpolated shape).\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hilarious. I started the same project c 2007 years. The task now is to generate
    a computer algorithm that can match human subjectivity (Good luck with that. One
    letter with 100 layers @1% opacity took me ~3 hours and a pitcher of beer. Our
    last attempt with an algorithm that came even <em>close</em> would have taken
    an average Mac tower ~3 months). Inspired by <a href=\"http://galton.org/composite.htm\">Galton\u2019s
    composite portraiture</a> (as Nick illustrated) and <a href=\"http://www.pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/avc/huber/prototype.htm\">Posner\u2019s
    work on prototype formation</a>. Hence the name of the typeface, ProtoType\u2122\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_4756.jpg]"
