  body: "This is a sweet, fun, na\xEFve font, and I like it. Some of the crazy inconsistency
    is charming, but I would evaluate the following:\r\n_ Why are the counters of
    the B, P, and R circles? Look at D, O, U. These glyphs are more successful.\r\n_
    The thins of the C, G, J, and S are thinner than the thins of D, E, O, etc. \r\n_
    I love how wack the V is, but wonder if an inverse of the A might not be more
    consistent.\r\n_ I love how wack the M is, and wouldn't change it.\r\n_ The circle
    in the G is lower, which gives you permission to lower the circles in A and F;
    they need it."

  body: "I really like the G ... a lot. Do you need the white outlines in the other
    letters using a circle?\r\n\r\nI'd agree with Chester's comments about D - O -
    U\r\nI'm not sure I agree with the M or the V ... and N - L seem a little wide\r\nThe
    S needs more curve finessing"
