  body: Don't want to upset anyone here, the amassed knowledge is awesome, but type
    designers and graphic designers are a very different breed. Zuzana and Rudy are
    type designing graphic designers, Hoefler is just amazing all round. Matthew Carter
    is great too. But many of the great type designers I've come across can't really
    *graphic design* to the same level. Having said this, there is far more skill
    and knowledge involved in type design, and I'm far more impressed with type design
    than graphic.

  body: "i actually would like to politely disagree. \r\n\r\ntype design is based
    on the principles of figure-ground relationships, harmony, legibility and individuality
    (amongst others). which is why I would anticipate that a type designer would have
    a pretty good understanding of layout and the context in which type has to work,
    and how they need to create a point of differentiation. even though i understand
    the difference between a graphic and a type designer, i refuse to believe that
    their influences are isolated, and therefore I cannot accept the fact that a type
    designer would literally throw away the \"skill and knowledge\" invested in their
    (or anybody else's) type design as it has been done in the examples that originated
    this thread."

  body: "That is not exactly what I was saying, sorry perhaps I was generalising.
    There is an obvious relationship between graphic design and type design, and there
    are great designers who also design type. There are graphic design type designers
    such as Johnathan Barnbrook (who may or may not be so great), and House Ind. who
    are collectively great illustrators and designers, but I have come across many
    more examples of great type designers with a poorer graphic application. In fact,
    I have encountered this mostly through links from this website to web pages, or
    personal work. I think you'll find many of the great graphic designers don't do
    all that much type design because they are not programmed like that, although,
    yes, you'll find that each has designed at least one typeface, but they are usually
    of the graphic kind, not text faces, or faces with huge European sets!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    from Conway's Game of Life</a>. I always thought it was <em>meant</em> to be that
    (it's a somewhat popular logo in geeky circles) but I did wonder why Typophile
    chose it.\r\n\r\nConway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton: a 2-d grid of
    squares, each one either \"alive\" or \"dead\" (black or white), with rules governing
    the birth, death and survival of a \"cell\" each timestep, based on the population
    surrounding it. If you start with a live cells in the configuration of the logo,
    four timesteps later you have the same configuration one cell north-east of the
    starting position."

    name (the beauty of the internet) that changes to showcase a different font each
    time the site is loaded/reloaded.\r\n\r\nAs for the foundries, wouldn't it be
    better to use actual fonts developed by the designer of the foundry? Much like
    Village, H&FJ and Emigre have done. Present the talents of the staff because a
    foundry can create custom type and it would be effective to showcase that in their

    never reach the popularity they enjoyed when they ruled the 70's, they still have

    loyalty they inspired by publishing the ever beautiful U&LC magazine. \r\n\r\nTheir

    people know nothing about design, though they certainly love directing designers.\r\n\r\nConversely
