  body: "No, it is certainly similar to University Roman - and may have been inspired
    by it, but almost all letterforms are significantly different.\r\n\r\nI know I've
    seen this before, but I've struck out in finding it."

  body: "The |&| is pretty carachteristic. There are many versions and alternates
    of University, few of which have been digitised (fortunately, one could say ;-).
    That |a|, for example, has the same construction of the alternate |a| in the Letraset
    version (minus the swash): http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/university-roman/regular/glyphs/156683/217
    and the Tilde version has that |B| construction (but not the swash): http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/univrsty-roman/regular/glyphs.html#glyphs/398885/37\r\n\r\nThere
    also is \"Forum Flare\", a swashed version of University: http://www.typophile.com/node/2833#comment-22664
    (unfortunately, images are broken in that thread), which apparently had that |t|:
    http://typophile.com/node/65162\r\nAll that said, the thing is carved in wood
    (notice the difference in swash between the |B|s), so it could well be a custom
    job \"inspired by\"."

  body: "Lots of good points, Riccardo. I'd missed that Tilde 'B'.\r\n\r\nAkira -
    thanks for the link to those wonderful images.\r\n\"What about Stunt Roman?\"
    \ -- The speedball lettering inspiration for University Roman.\r\n\r\nI finally
    found where I'd seen those letters. It's in Phil's Photos \"Homage To the Alphabet\"
    - a catalog of the photolettering fonts offered by the precursor to today's Philsfonts.com.
    It's called Celtic Cursive and contains (with lots of alternates) the same 'a',
    ampersand and other letters. What's different is the swash under the B and, most
    troubling, that skewed bowl of the 'd' - which I've not seen in any variation
    of this design. I'd post an image, but that is frustratingly almost never successful
    for me."

  body: My guess is that the signmaker set the type in University Roman, enlarged
    it, and traced it onto the plank of wood. Then he/she cut away the background
    with a router, leaving the raised letterforms. Both tracing and routing are freehand
    processes, giving the signmaker leeway to modify the University Roman letterforms
    wherever necessary to accommodate his/her taste or the grain of the wood. (Some
    wood signs are cut with a laser, with very smooth and regular results, but this
    one doesn't look like that.)
