  has text saying \"Magna\" in a sort-of Magneto look-a-like font.  I was wondering
  if anyone could identify this font and direct me to where I can purchase/download
  it.  Thanks in advance, Polarity.\r\n"

  body: "I'm pretty sure this looks custom, or at least I don't think it's a commercially
    available font. The M seems out of character with the rest of the letters, and
    could have bee borrowed from a slab serif font. The closest I can suggest to the
    rest of the lettering is Linotype's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/atomatic/?refby=bowfin\">Atomatic</a>.
    It would need the tops filled in to make them straight line, and then compressed
    a bit, but it would be close. Of course the g tail would need to be fixed. \r\n\r\n-
