  body: 'This is an old Letraset font called Beans. It was released in 1973 and was
    dropped from the catalog after a couple of years. Also: the "B" in the sample
    is an inverted "P".'

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Latest+Releases/BEANS/\">Lineto
    releases Beans</a> or \u2013 so to speak \u2013 their interpretation of it. \r\n\r\n<i>Designer:
    Charles Grant / Date: 2008 (1973) / Category: Graphic Fonts\r\n\r\nOriginally
    designed by German designer Dieter Zembsch in 1973, \xABLL BEANS\xBB is a Letragraphica
    classic that never lost its curious charm and which, in our opinion, has been
    begging for adaptation into the digital realm.\r\nCharles Grant, an emerging graphic
    designer based in Manchester, collaborated with Dieter Zembsch and Lineto on a
    digital recreation of the original rub-down classic. Taking advantage of OpenType
    technology, Grant added many special characters and alternative glyphs, thus boosting
    the potential of the \xABBeans\xBB font by virtually re-inventing its character
    set, and offering both the original set and many new options to the discerning
    user.\r\nThe original Zembsch set is accessed with \xABcaps lock\xBB activated,
    whilst new characters & alternates are mapped to the lower case and to OpenType
    Stylistic Sets respectively</i>\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oops, that is what Mr. Grant probably
    wanted to say in the post above, which I didn\u2019t realize, while posting. Sorry
    for the double information. "
