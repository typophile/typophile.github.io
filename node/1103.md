body: I don&#39;t have a sample that I&#39;m trying to identify, but rather, I&#39;m
  trying to find examples of practical applications which utilize Swift. <BR>The font
  was designed for newspaper use, but which publications use it currently? I&#39;ve
  been checking <a href="http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/" target="_blank">http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/</a>
  without luck so far, but they include a limited number of publications from Holland
  and Belgium &#40;where I believe Swift is most popular.&#41; The Italian paper <a
  href="http://www.ilmanifesto.it" target="_blank">http://www.ilmanifesto.it</a> uses
  it for headlines. <BR>I would be grateful for any leads &#40;names of newspapers,
  dictionaries, books, corporate identities, etc.&#41; that incorporate this typeface,
  and I&#39;d be very happy to collect as many different examples as possible. Hope
  my request is not completely inappropriate for this forum. If there is another resource
  on the web to find examples of fonts in use, I&#39;d be happy to be informed.  <BR>Many
  thanks.

  body: Stephen, did <i>USA Today</i> really used to use Swift? I thought they always
    employed Gulliver. <BR> <BR><i>HOW</i> magazine used to use Swift, prior to the
    Feb 2000 redesign. I was sorry to see it go. Look for back issues for some nice
    Swift usage. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Kent, we know. My tongue was firmly placed in cheek. <BR>I just wanted
    to stress that you&#39;re an invaluable asset  <BR>to our Type IDing activities.
    <BR> <BR><i>&#62; Aw shucks. No need to push or shove, though.</i> <BR> <BR>Blame
    my &#34;inventive&#34; use of English and my silly  <BR>Belgian sense of humour

    border=0> <BR> <BR>&#42;Actually, I wouldn&#39;t mind that much, &#39;cause I
    fully  <BR>realize I DO behave like one &#40;a fool that is&#41; lots  <BR>of
    times. Hence the heavy use of emoticons in my  <BR>posts. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"

  body: That&#39;s a very kind offer, Yves. It would be wonderful to have a real printed
    sample. I&#39;m writing from Switzerland, which at least <i>shares borders with</i>Europe,
    so I will see if I can find some international newsstand here that carries &#34;De
    Morgen&#34;. If all else fails, I will try to coax you into sending me a newspaper
    by offering a reward for your trouble. &#40;Swiss chocolate works in some places,
    but as Belgium is very happy with their own chocolate industry, I&#39;ll have
    to come up with something else.&#41;  <BR>Thanks too to everyone else for all
    the helpful suggestions about where to find Swift in action.
