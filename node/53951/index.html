		<div class="commentbody">Bunsen burner comes to mind initially. When scaled down its hard to distinguish the thumb from the finger line, maybe bring it up a point size or two.

It all looks rather flat as well. Maybe bring in some gradients on the leaf to add a bit of depth and perhaps scale the leaf up so it over laps the circle.

Typographically the two faces work well together, be good to see some other variations tho.

Overall a decent marque up till now, just a bit more experimentation needed!</div>

And I'd like to say that your design already shows its weakness. Small size problems. Thumb lines are lost, text isn't readable and I also think that font choice of GESAC doesn't complement mark very well. But this last thing is barely my taste. They may as well go together well.

		<div class="commentbody">Typically the gradient and the colors are secondary to the actual geometry of the mark. There are some notable exceptions of course, but your case is not one of them. So I'd gather the feedback regarding the B/W version of the mark first, and fine-tune the color treatment and such second.

In this context I think the original version is not bad. I would consider using uniform thickness for the circling line. Additionally, one way to avoid a loss of a thumb detail at small scale is to do something like this:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hand_5891.png]

.
However in general the mark is a little to bland. As someone else said regarding some of my own work  - "it doesn't have an AHA moment". At very least, the mark is reminiscent of WWII memorials you can find in (Eastern) Europe - two hands guarding fragile eternal flame representing a memory of fallen solders. 

As a suggestion - try and use the negative space you have within the circle. For example, have a look at [[http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/48073|this logo]] and see how it has three related concepts seamlessly blended into a single mark.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Michael in which statement was I hostile? the first part of my post was just saying that screaming at people to be honest isn't very good. Because I think we are honest here giving our point of view on someone else's work.

So the first part couldn't be. Because it's not a critique of the mark. It has to be the second part. And in the second part I was being honest. I pointed out small size problems with thin line and small text. Which is true. The part where mark doesn't complement type was my opinion as I also pointed it out.

I really can't see where was I hostile?

But it's true I didn't say anything positive. Like colour combination. I normally like green/blue logo combination. But colours should come to play after BW mark is working.

And I also think that green leaf is a tad too close to hands in the new design. But legibility has improved.

The font choice is very bland (is that TNR with the 'G' modified?). I'd go with something that complements the leaf/flame shape. If you're stuck without a budget, try using Fertigo Pro, Fontin, or Diavlo from exljbris.

		<div class="commentbody">lateblues, the logo has an interesting idea that's not being executed as well as it should be. It smacks of too much computer thinking and not enough print and sketch thinking. The details on the thumbs and the type are just too small. Print it out at the size you would use it for a business card and letterhead to see what I mean. The details and the type will disappear or turn into 'ant tracks'.

I suggest more curves in the hands to make them more hand-like. Think about the leaf/flame thing. Is this what you want? Also, the relative size of the leaf to the hands: Are the hands protecting the huge leaf? Are they supporting it? Are they avoiding touching it? In a logo, every line communicates, so be aware of it. Try shifting the relative sizes and see how it changes the message.

Also, as others have said, choose type with more warmth or more personality. GESAC looks authoritative, but it also looks too bureaucratic next to the mark. The sans serif type is just too small and is not well paired with the serif type. If you're a student, I know your options are limited, but these are not strong type choices. They should have a harmony or a purposeful contrast with the mark. Right now, they look like they just happened to be in the same place.

All this being said, there's a strong mark at the core. You can develop this and make it work. It does look like some other logos I've seen, but for student work it's more important to explore and understand the craft and concepts than it is to get worried about similarities (short of looking like a rip-off, of course).

Keep trying and keep exploring. Go to a site like FontShop and poke around their hand-picked fonts for inspiration. Also, try looking at <a href="http://students.umf.maine.edu/~ouellecj/webquest/handsdirt.jpeg.jpg">images like this one</a> and figure out what they have that your mark does and doesn't. Use these explorations to start fresh on the same approach.</div>

All the type is too tight, loosen things up a bit.

The global environmental on top is not working and is out of place.

experiment with different typefaces! and justification- try justified left.

I like the leaf overlapping the circle, but you enlarged it a tad too much - bring it away from the hands a tad.

As mentioned above get the mono logo working first then add a lick of paint.

I think that you have some interesting white space to work with - the space between the hands and the outer circle looks to me as an upside-down reflection of the hands themselves, you might be able to do something with that.
