  Postscript Windows fonts I&#39;ve generated from FOG. I&#39;ve generated them several
  times and she installs them several times with the same unfortunate results - Being
  that they won&#39;t install at all in ATM. <BR> <BR>After several queries, several
  folks have told me it&#39;s in the way the Mac version of FOG generates this format
  and that I should consider generating them from FontLab. <BR> <BR>Apparently there
  is some sort of &#39;Adobe&#39; glitch in FOG. Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Stuart
