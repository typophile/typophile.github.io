  but I know she's extremely busy. That <em>a</em> is unusual. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ambermac_6313.png]

  body: You can also purchase individual weights seperately, if you don't need an
    entire typefamily. Like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_dax_rg_rg_exp/">FF
    Dax Regular and Regular Exp.</a> Not too expensive. :)

  body: This is actually <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_daxline_bold/&sample_text=AmberMac&sample_size=60">FF
    Daxline</a>, Hans Reichel's improvement over the original design. Better proportions,
    lower stroke contrast.
