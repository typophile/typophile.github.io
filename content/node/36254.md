    Sign Painter happy to use! And for me, when I have one of those customer's that
    need a \"feminine touch\" as DOW -- well, Sarah Script comes through every time!\r\n\r\nThank
    you.\r\n\r\nI'm curious - it was a great job for a first time font, what was your
    inspiration?"

  body: "I am glad you like it Jackie. I made Sarah Script for my wife, Sarah, when
    our second child was born. I thought it would be fun to make a font for her that
    could generate some income so she could be a stay home Mom. So far so good. :)
    All of my love for her went into that font, I guess you could say. I was orginally
    going to have three versions. The original, a version without connectors, and
    a version that had all flourishes. I never got the chance to do it. Maybe someday.
    I am currently working on a period style script that has alot of alternate chars.
    Should be fun to finally get it done.\r\n\r\nHave a great day,\r\n-Charles\r\n"

    way?
