  body: "Reading the book reminds me for some reason  of the book that was published
    by the author Amnon Shamosh and Prof.  Ofer: Ha-Keter: The Story of the Aleppo
    Codex which was published in 1987. \r\nThe book by Shamosh is mentioned in the
    book ( by Hayim Tawil & Bernard Schneider) ; his brother Yitzhak  Shamosh was
    one of the men that tried to save the Aleppo Codex.\r\n\r\nThere are unfortunately
    inaccurate things in the book.\r\n I've mentioned the book by Shamosh... which
    \  was published by Ben-Zvi Institute, and not the Hebrew University as they indicate
    in their bibliography!!!\r\n\r\n When they explain about the Msaorah notes they
    write (page 22):\r\n\"The abbreviated note in the margin indicates something about
    the word identified in the text \u2014 for example, the letter \"lamed,\" standing
    for the Aramaic word \"leta,\" or \"none,\", tells us that this word, or this
    form of the word, appears nowhere else in the Bible.\"\r\n\r\nNow how does this
    explain the lamed which means none tells us that? Not by their explantion. \r\nThe
    Aramaic, or the full Masorah term is \u05DC\u05D9\u05EA\u05D0 \u05D3\u05DB\u05D5\u05D5\u05EA\u05D9\u05D4
    which could be translated into English as unique. Indeed \u05DC\u05D9\u05EA\u05D0
    \u05D3\u05DB\u05D5\u05D5\u05EA\u05D9\u05D4    isn't written, but they should know
    that if they are writing about that subject. Moreover, this term could be found
    in the  Babylonian Masorah: \u05D5\u05DC\u05D9\u05EA \u05D3\u05DB\u05D5\u05EA\u05D9\u05D4
    \u05D1\u05DB\u05DC \u05D4\u05DE\u05E7\u05E8\u05D0\r\nand in Midrash va-Yikrah
    Raba:\u05D9\u05D5\u05D3 \u05D6\u05E2\u05D9\u05E8 \u05D5\u05DC\u05D9\u05EA \u05D1\u05E7\u05E8\u05D9\u05D0
    \u05DB\u05D5\u05D5\u05EA\u05D9\u05D4 \r\n\r\n\r\nPage 29: \"After a somewhat fitful
    beginning, during which the literature professor Yitzhak Shamosh initially attempted
    to acquire the codex, Professor Cassuto was chosen to travel to Aleppo in late
    1943.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that does not tell us why they chose Yitzhak. First and foremost,
    he was a lawyer, and he taught  Arabic language and literature (the Hebrew University);
    he came from a well respected family! which contributed to him being chosen. He
    visited twice -- first in July and the second time in September. In the second
    time when he saw that the Codex was staying there, he asked if Prof. Cassuto could
    come and see the codex.\r\n\r\nWhat they didn't mention regarding Prof. Cassuto
    was  that he was the Chief Rabbi of Firenze, Italy!!! (not just rabbi).  That
    is why the Aleppo community treated him with respect when he was there.\r\n\r\nThese
    are some of the mistakes....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
