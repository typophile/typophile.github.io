body: "At Typekit, we've had to turn away several really nice typefaces because their
  amount of detail equates to significant file size. Especially type with a built-in
  sketchy or distressed look. They're just too large, and cause too long a wait as
  people browse Typekit.com and the websites that use these fonts.\r\n\r\nSolid versions
  of such typefaces might help, as might editing the details a bit. Are there strategies
  for simplifying overly complex letterforms? Have type designers had to consider
  file size in this way before?"

    to be too large?"

  body: Fontographer has a Clean Up Paths feature that works well to reduce file size
    - I used to have my students see how small they could get fonts they made by running
    it several times,  worked well on grunge fonts and sketchy ones done from scans

  body: "Tim, yes they have. Early imagesetters had slow RIPs so complex pages, pages
    with heavy images, or complex fonts took longer to process in the RIP. Same deal
    with the early laserprinter RIPs. Thus some fonts were designed with this in mind.
    That meant straight lines were favoured over curves, and the number of segments
    were kept low. Some RIPs would use curve-flattening \u2013 converting the curves
    short segments of straight lines."

  body: "Jackson: Trixie is actually a really interesting case! The folks at FontShop
    offer FF Trixie Web as a Web FontFont, which despite its detail is only about
    twice the file size of an average font. This is certainly acceptable. The problematic
    faces I'm talking about are extremely large \u2014\_1.5mb/variation, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the tip, Bob!\r\n\r\nClaus: That's really interesting, about the old imagesetters.
    It can sometimes seem like the web/screen hurdles we face are brand new, but I'd
    guess there are quite a few parallels to previous technologies."

  body: "Generally, I try to avoid Fontographer's Clean Up Paths feature except to
    insert extrema: even at its lowest setting, it's a little too aggressive about
    simplified, especially with round-serif fonts. However, sometimes--as noted above--Clean
    Up Paths works like a charm. The example below shows the letterforms as I originally
    drew it (left), with 97 nodes and all-straight-line segments. Using CUP at the
    maximum (5) setting reduced the number of nodes to about one-third the original,
    and still maintained the felt-tip-pen-on-napkin effect I was going for.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/boop_boop_3981.png]"

    software is possible. \r\n\r\nTim> Have type designers had to consider file size

    ask to the thousands of designs in use today where the average letter would be
    a larger file than most complete fonts \u2014 are you not better served as a graphic?\r\n\r\nI
    know @FF use is going to have a great pull on people's minds, but I also think
