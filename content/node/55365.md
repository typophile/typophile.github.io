body: "Mardi Gras is a holiday unique to the New Orleans area, it's an interesting
  time, where normal people, both local and from all over the world, come to let their
  more \"wild\" sides out. Acting crazy, wearing zany costumes, and shouting at the
  top of your lungs in an attempt to get some to throw you beads, it's not you normal
  holiday. We also see examples of the creative side in people coming out, something
  they may not get a chance to express on a regular basis. This is mostly done through
  various \"costumes\" that people design for themselves, they're kids, they're poor
  dogs, etc. However, one does come across a few costumes which feature a use of type
  in them, often using hand-written lettering, here are a few examples:\r\n<a href=\"http://s583.photobucket.com/albums/ss274/Helios05/?action=view&current=DSCF0631.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i583.photobucket.com/albums/ss274/Helios05/DSCF0631.jpg\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"Mardi Gras\">The Wagons</a>\r\nThis example shows people using
  type primarily on the wagons, such as in the lower right corner of the picture,
  where it says \"Krewe de la Rue\", but the middle wagon which says \"AIR\" appears
  to have been done with a stencil.\r\n<a href=\"http://s583.photobucket.com/albums/ss274/Helios05/?action=view&current=DSCF0637.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i583.photobucket.com/albums/ss274/Helios05/DSCF0637.jpg\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"Mardi Gras 4\">Body Type</a>\r\nAh alcohol, the things you convince
  us to do. Here is another example of handwritten type, this time actually on a person's
  body. We also see an example of the kind of social commentary one gets out of Mardi
  Gras, mostly controversial subjects often ending up as lewd jokes, but there's a
  certain blatant honesty about it.\r\n<a href=\"http://s583.photobucket.com/albums/ss274/Helios05/?action=view&current=DSCF0665.jpg\"

  border=\"0\" alt=\"Mardi Gras 3\">The Elderly Couple</a>\r\nMy personal favorite
  out of the set, showing how the energy and natural humor that is a part of Mardi
  Gras is shared by young and old. We also have and interesting contrast thanks to
  the type in this photo. One, we have the small child sitting in the ladder with
  \"LSU\" painted on the side, then look diagonally down to the signs the elderly
  couple are wearing, and we see how Mardi Gras is celebrate throughout the years
  by people both young and old. "
