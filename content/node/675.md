  body: Hi Miguel <BR> <BR>wow, really nice pixelfont.. <BR> <BR>but for my taste
    the letters are a little bit too bold. <BR>What is the minimum pixelsize of &#34;kuppa&#34;?
    <BR> <BR>regards <BR>Christoph

  body: Thanks for your comment guys,  <BR> <BR>I always love cooper, sauna and all
    the fatty titling fonts outhere, i wish to include kuppa in the next launch of
    atomicmedia if it is good enough to be used. <BR> <BR>I dont know if the letters
    are &#34;too&#34; bold, to be hard to read or something? <BR> <BR>What do you
    think about the V, W &amp; y ?  <BR> <BR>MH.

    too wide

  body: It&#39;s a nice design, but I think you could make the caps at least 1 pixel
    taller, and maybe 1 pixel bolder. They look too small and light comparing to the
    lowercase. <BR>Also, the serifs, specially in lowercase characters, look too much
    like small &#34;circles&#34;, just attached to the stroke endings.

  body: I will try to fix and test your suggestions guys, <BR>but i like to keep the
    small size. The minimalism justify the function of pixel fonts, i think. <BR>

  body: '&#34;cooper&#34; = barrelmaker. &#40;barrel = big wood container&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Kuppa = so close to gentle Cooper black - yet so hard to tell whether it should
    be ONE pixel bigger overall to convey Cooper&#39;s humanity. <BR> <BR>But no!
    Let it live at this size, with this italic. <BR> <BR>TS: You mean welcome back
    Kotter? <BR>welcome back - your dreams were your ticket out. <BR>Welcome back
    - To the same ole place that you laughed about. <BR> <BR>MH: How are you going
    to do the punctuation? The cooper asterisk is a monster, let alone @ or Euro.  <BR>
    <BR>Sauna is fantastic, I have the book. It &#40;book&#41; survives reading in
    the shower. Kuppa adds the Nintendo crispness. Can they sit in a fat sweaty sauna
    together? [faints]'

  body: '&#62; It &#40;book&#41; survives reading in the shower. <BR> <BR>Reminds
    me of something stupid I did when I was a teen. I was reading a riveting Conan
    or Moorcock or something, and couldn&#39;t put it down, but I also needed to take
    a shower. So I put in a large ziplock bag and read it in the shower. It kinda
    worked, but the overhead of turning the pages &#40;pretty tricky through the bag&#41;
    didn&#39;t make it worthwhile - plus the book still got slightly damp. <BR> <BR>hhp

    white pixels into little rainbow dots. And there is only one good font on pocket

  body: I believe &#34;a Journal of Typography&#34; in Miguel&#39;s example above
    shows the italic form. The serif ends switch sides to &#42;imply&#42; a slant
    on the vertical.
