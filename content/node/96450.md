body: I heavily modified a letter from a typeface and will be displaying it on my
  site as a portfolio piece. My questions is, would this be considered "lettering"
  or "type"?

    barely even be \"lettering\". More like \"letter art\". It can still be pretty
    though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The problem is I have two categories. "Lettering" and "Typography". I have
    placed all my logo work using typefaces into "Typography" and all my lettering
    work into "Lettering". I think my safest option here is to keep it under "Lettering".
