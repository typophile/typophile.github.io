    relative global clumsiness is intentional or not. I can't state if it's a mash-up,
    some letters gathered together for this lettering, a amateur techy freebie or
    customization of an existing font. Some letters look extended (/E, /R), some less
    (/U, /I, /L, /Y, /J). Some look techy (/S, /R), some look to come from a freebie
    san (/J, /M). You could start for instance with [[http://www.dafont.com/sf-old-republic.font|Old
    Republic SF]], extend and even /E bars, redraw /S with 2 face-to-face /P counters
    and recreate /R with /P adding a leg. \r\nSome more \"similars\": mixing [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/proto-fet|Protofet]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/werk-haus|WerkHaus]] TNB, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/q-bo/moiser|Moiser]]"

    honest I thought it probably would be a custom job, but thanks too for suggestions
    of existing fonts I can play with to try and create the same kind of effect.\r\n\r\n"
