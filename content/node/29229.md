body: "So... I\u2019ve been perusing this site and others for some time and have finally
  made progress on my first font.\r\n\r\nI've been really amazed at what a supportive
  and  collaborative environment there is. You might think it would be  secretive
  and competitive, but people seem happy to spread the information and love for designing
  type.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m nicknaming it Router, because it is based on a sign that I
  saw in the subway where the letters are drilled out of plastic.\r\n\r\nI drew the
  shapes as simple lines with a stroke so I could make lighter and heavier weights
  if I wanted. Then, I expanded the objects and started redrawing. I particularly
  like the hard angles that happen inside the m, h, n, u etc. But, I\u2019m not sure
  it\u2019s dramatic enough... Doesn\u2019t really have an effect when it\u2019s reduced
  to smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nPage 1 are the letters I\u2019ve worked out the most (hamburgefonts),
  and page 2 shows an example of the sign (with levels adjusted for ease of tracing).
  Also, the number 8 which was my first love in this font.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a
  great learning experience. I can only imagine how much more I will discover as I
  go along.\r\n\r\nAll the best. And thanks for your willingness to take a look at
  this.\r\n\r\nJeremy\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It does indeed look like it was cut with a router on an engraving jig.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"2\" seems a bit topheavy and leans to the left and I'm not sure what to make
    of the angle cut in the \"r\".  The arches of the \"m\" and \"n\" transition into
    their uprights a bit too abruptly. Otherwise, this is looking very good."
