  body: I think it&#39;s custom, but I think it might be easy to make if these are
    all the letters you need. The &#39;a&#39; looks like a reversed G. The M looks
    like it could have been made by inverting the &#39;u&#39; and extending the strokes,
    then overlaying it with the same new character. A flattened version of <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205099"
    target="_blank">TC Europa</a> could be a starting point to create this. Other
    squared fonts might work even better. <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t see any other
    letters, then I think this is a custom job for sure.

    Contendre is another possible font you could start from <BR>and modify. It&#39;s
    free and would yield this: <BR><blockquote><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27186.gif"

  body: I tried to do what I claimed could be done, and I admit I needed to play with
    outlines more than I thought I would have to, but here is my clumsy attempt to
    re-create this using Agfa&#39;s TC Europa Bold. You can see my skill with outline
    manipulation in Illustrator is not very polished, but this only took about 15
    minutes.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27204.gif"
