  body: "Hi FluxApparel,\r\n\r\nThe San Serif fonts you request an ID for are very
    common\r\nARMIN VAN BUUREN = Helvetica Black\r\nREMIXES, FEATURING CINDY ALMA,
    MIKKAS PROTOCULTURE = Akzidenz Grotesk Bold\r\n\r\nAs for - Beautiful life - It's
    possibly hand written so does this need to be exact? You don't say why.\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    life's too short and there really are 1000s of scripts out on the WWW so just
    pick one - whatever, it will probably look neater/cleaner than the one here. \r\nHave
    a look at:\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/classification/handdrawn\r\nIt
    may be a good place to start. Hope this helps.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nDoghouse"

  body: "Hi Ryuk,\r\n\r\nGreat observation on the \"hand-drawn\" clues on those repeated
    characters in the script. \r\n\r\nLooks like one for the auto trace plug-in to
    make an accurate copy on that one.\r\n\r\nAlso, nice selection of alternative
    scripts there, sir.\r\n\r\nCool\r\n\r\nDawg"
