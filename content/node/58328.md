  that categorizes fonts. I have a type examination coming up and im not feeling well
  read on this subject.\r\n\r\nIm thinking age. Which characteristics defines 1500th
  century fonts, 1600th century fonts and so on!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Can your instructors point you to reference works so you can prepare for
    the examination? Were any handouts provided? Do you have access to a good design
    library?\r\n\r\nThere are so many different systems to categorize fonts. Take
    a look at Luc Devroye's extensive overview at \r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/classify.html\r\n\r\nIn
    Switzerland a lot of schools still teach the DIN system or Bosshard's modified
    version of it. Three books that are often recommended:\r\nSchriften erkennen:
    Sauthoff, Wendt, Willberg (Verlag H. Schmidt)\r\nTechnische Grundlagen zur Satzherstellung:
    Hans-Rudolf Bosshard (Niggli)\r\nBuchstaben kommen selten allein: Indra Kupferschmid
    (Niggli)\r\n\r\nIndra Kupferschmid's book contrasts the historical classification
    (DIN) and the classification according to formal principles (static/dynamic) which
    Gerrit Noordzij described in detail.\r\n"
