  target=_blank>type high</a> became .918 inches?\r\nI've heard explanations that
  range from it being a totally arbitrary number (which I find hard to believe) to
  having it correspond to the length of someone's thumb.\r\nIs there a definitive
  answer to this that anyone knows of?"

  body: "The exact measurement was a metrical one, i.e. based on the meter, namely
    one fifteenth (i.e. 1/15) of 35 centimeters, so that the height of paper or height
    to paper or type height was exactly .9186 inches (instead of .918 inches). For
    details see Victor Strauss, The Printing Industry, Bowker 1967, page 60 and page
    753.\r\n\r\n(The US typographical point size measurement was also a metrical one,
    namely eighty-three picas were set as equal to 35 centimeters, i.e. 83 x 12 =
    996 points.)"

    mineral spirits.

  body: Thanks, Uli. I'll check the Strauss book you noted. In the mean time, do you
    know <em>when</em> the switchover to .918" came about and what spurred it? Was
    it a sweeping conversion from old to new that many foundries agreed upon at once?
    Maybe something similar to the formation of ATF happened which forced a large
    group of foundries to standardize?

  body: "I think I may have found my answer <a href=http://www.sizes.com/tools/type.htm#height
    target=_blank>here</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite>Until 1886, in North America the height of
    the type or plates, from the surface of the platen to the face of the type, was
    11\u204412 inch = 0.9166\u2026. In that year the U. S. Type Founders Assn. adopted
    a new type height when it adopted the point system. Having decided that the pica
    would be defined by 83 pica = 35 centimeters, it decided to let 15 type heights
    = 35 centimeters. So type height became 23.333\u2026 millimeters, approximately
    0.918 inches. Although only 0.002 inches higher than the old standard, this difference
    is great enough that old and new type could not be mixed in the same line.</cite>\r\n\r\nDoes
    that sound about right, or are there other aspects that I'm missing still?"

    you have access to a large library and if you need a scholarly source for the
    when and why, you may wish to consult Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography,
    Oxford 1972, pages 283-284 (chapter \"Type since 1875\").\r\n\r\n(The term \"bibliography\"
    does not have its usual meaning here. Instead it here has the special meaning
    of describing the criminalistic-like methods of identifying how a given old book
    was technically typeset and printed.)\r\n"
