  body: "I think we have seen samples like this before, and I seem to recall that
    we thought they were customizations made by adding the same 'connector' to existing
    letters. This may be a font, but it also could quite easily have been done just
    by pasting the connector shape between each pair of letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
