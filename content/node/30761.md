body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been looking for different ligatures for a school project
  and found this typeface...I just can't seem to figure out what it is, but I think
  it looks very elegant, subtle yet contemporary.\r\n\r\nThese examples are designed
  by Red Design for Gresham Blake (you can see the full photo on their website http://www.red-design.co.uk/
  - still - gresham blake).\r\n\r\nDid Red Design make this themselves or is it an
  exsisting typeface?\r\nif it is an exsisting one, would anyone know the name of
  it and where I could buy it?\r\n\r\nthank you very much!\r\n\r\ngrtz,\r\ndav2."

    but it's different.

  body: "thank you very much for your quick replies!\r\n\r\nSo it could be that the
    changed the lingua a little bit for their own needs? Or would you think it's an
    exsisting font still?\r\n\r\nIt's quite hard to see the details of the bjork book.
    I think I'll just send an email to Red Design, they should be able to tell me,
    right?"
