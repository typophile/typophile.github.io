body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI have a major problem: my font is completely ready, I
  double checked everything, opentype features, opentype classes, kerning classes
  and so on. When I generate the font, fontlab does not complain about anything (just
  slowing around 92%). And then when I try to install it through Font Book, Font Book
  refuses to install it and warn me that the file is not good and can corrupt the
  system. Yet when I put the font in the \"Fonts\" file of InDesign, it works perfectly.
  What could the problem be? As I have no tip from Fontlab about any problem, I am
  a bit lost..."

    without any class or opentype features, and the problem remains! The problem seems
    to come from the glyphs themselves. So what does it mean? That the design is that
    bad? ^^'

  body: "If you have double checked everything and there was no problem, it must be
    a bug in your Mac.\r\n\r\nJust kidding. You give us absolutely no hint as to where
    the problem may be: Operating system, InDesign version, error messages, or even
    what exactly you \"double checked\". Everything is left to our mighty crystal
    balls. \r\n\r\nJust a wild guess from a Windows guy: is there an open glyph in
    your font? (No idea as to how forgiving font book/InDesign is in that respect.\r\n\r\nAndreas\r\n\r\nPS:
    Found something in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_Book|article of the
    Unspeakable on Font Book]]. Read the \"criticism\" section. Maybe an OS upgrade
    will help."

  body: I rebuilt again the kern feature and did some other changes... Now things
    have changed :) When I try to install the font with Font Book, it does not bug,
    but nothing happens, the font does not appear, and when I try a second time to
    install it, the font appear with a little dot which means it has been installed
    twice... Still it remains akward.
