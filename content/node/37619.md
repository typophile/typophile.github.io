  body: "These letters are modifications of what was originally (predigitally) called
    Black Casual according to one of my references. Digitally, the best version by
    far is Jason Walcott's <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000081#specimen\"
    target=\"_blank\">Block Party</a> - which is pretty faithful to the original.\r\n\r\nAn
    intentionally rough, freehand version was created by Manfred Klein a couple of
    years ago. He called it <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein05/deco02/egypt_free.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Egyptian Freehand</a>.\r\n\r\nAnother (unintentionally) rough
    version is <a href=\"http://www.ronaldsansone.com/fonts/\" target=\"_blank\">Ronald
    Sansone's</a> Dark One.\r\n\r\nEdit: Rats ... 3 minutes late. Nice catch, Randy."
