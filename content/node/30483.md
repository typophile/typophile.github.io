  but had no idea where it came from, then I saw it again just recently - it certainly
  appears to be the same face, looking at the 'G' and N, R, C. But what the heck is

  body: '"3 decades of photography" really looks like Gill Sans to me. I suppose if
    "Bill Henson" is the same, it would be Gill Sans Light. I can''t make out "the
