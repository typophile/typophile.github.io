		<div class="commentbody">Sarah, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True, you can download free fonts for PC or Mac, but you've got to realize that you get what you pay for. In most cases, free fonts lack the quality you would find in purchasing the font through an established foundry, especially if you're intending on using these fonts for professional use. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For what its worth, there's a list of free font sites (and foundries) in the Typophile Open Directory Project.

		<div class="commentbody">Sarah Scheer - <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You had asked: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;I want to get a font collection going for projects that I am in the process of working on now, and I need help.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not knowing anything about how long you've been around graphic design, or advertising, apart from your being a recent student (according to your profile here), I'd like to interject one thing, if I may. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's very important to have a budget for type that somehow relates to how you are choosing to run your studio, or how you might be a working designer within an agency. Or, a publication designer for an alumni magazine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A possible approach: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Whittle down to a short list of which legitimately sold, commercial fonts that you might want to start with.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At an absolute minimum? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two four-weight type families would give you great flexibility; one being a sanserif family and one being a serif family. Ok, add one more: You should probably have at least one useful script font that you wouldn't be embarassed to use repeatedly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Each of the four-weight families would have a Book, Bold, Book Italic and Bold Italic. For flexibility. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That might come to about $150 to $200. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too costly for one month? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Choose one of the four-weight families, and just buy that.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) Here's the only hard part: Which one? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You'll do yourself and your client a great favor by using something credible but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a) Not a System Font; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->b) Not a typical newspaper or magazine text font; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c) Not something you see everyday. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quiz your client(s) on their preferences, in very general terms, for serif or sanserif in display and in text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If they express no preference, or trust you as designer implicitly (which is where you can get to over time when you do things proactively and responsibly to engender the client's trust), then simply choose what you like. Don't get too hung up with serif versus sanserif, to start out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The point is to start giving your work the legitimacy of using authentically crafted, high quality fonts. And to start right from the get go, doing something unique. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Check out that the character sets are complete and well made, and that the fonts have adequate kerning and spacing that actually does work. Make sure the mood suits your needs, and that the numbers (figures) and currency marks and punctuation do what they're supposed to. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can simply e-mail or phone the type foundries and ask. They (and we) love to get questions from designers who have made type important to their work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's the surprisingly easy part, if you open your mind to it:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4) Get the client to pay for it! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Within the structure of a project or campaign quote, the cost of fonts is very inexpensive. If you work with historically cheap clients, it will simply be necessary to take them through what you're trying to bring to their project or campaign through uniqueness. Discuss it as a natural extension of the branding effort. Which, after all, is true. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trust me, it works! But the responsible designer starts to consider the need for distinct, quality typefaces and build that in early, into the early strategizing and into the early quote discussions and paperwork. It's every bit as crucial to the long term credibility of your work as buying illustration or photography will be. And since type often carries where there's no budget at all for illustration or photography, one could make the point that it's more crucial. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All that is a much more important consideration to your design career than spending lots of time that could be used for creativity, instead trying to 'score free fonts'. Much more important. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good luck. And don't forget: It's your career that you're formulating. Your life's work! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
