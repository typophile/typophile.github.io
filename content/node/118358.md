body: "I'm still working on an upcoming typeface called Melk Sans. I had major issues
  before which have been fixed, but today I noticed a minor issue and I'm puzzled
  as to what is the cause. I thought I would start this thread not only to ask for
  feedback on this issue, but to ask other questions as well.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the
  issue I'm having now is in the OpenType features when used together. As you can
  see in the PDF, the standard ligatures work fine (fi and ff are contextual ligatures
  which I placed in the standard ligatures set because they're less obtrusive than
  connected ligatures, which I threw out), the discretionary ligatures (st) work fine
  and the stylistic alternates work fine when the discretionary ligatures are turned
  off. However, when the stylistic alternates are turned on either with the standard
  ligatures or discretionary ligatures or both, some of the ligatures are being replaced;
  the second /st ligature is being replaced by an alternate /a and the /ff ligature
  is being replaced by /ar. Can someone explain what's going on there?\r\n\r\nThe
  order of the OT features in FontLab is the following: DLIG, LIGA, SS01, SALT, CALT.\r\n\r\nI
  figured I must be doing something wrong with that order but I still don't see the
  logic in ligatures being replaced by different letters which I didn't actually program
  that way. Also, is it possible at all to turn stylistic sets on in Illustrator?
  For now I have the same code in both SS01 and SALT. I would prefer to make a few
  stylistic sets, but if there is no support for it in Illustrator I might have to
  use SALT and generate a few different fonts with different SALT programming."

  body: "Whatever the problem was before, it's fixed now. I changed the order of the
    OT functions so it might have had something to do with that.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
    know if stylistic sets are accessible in Illustrator? If not, how do you still
    give people access to such features in Illustrator, or don't you?"

  body: "No, stylistic sets are not accessible in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nEither you let
    the glyphs remain inaccessible in Illustrator (as they are in many non-pro apps),
    or you duplicate them to some other feature(s). If you only have one or two stylistic
    sets it isn't so bad, but it becomes impractical with many such sets.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, one might hope that Adobe would add the functionality to Illustrator.
    But I wouldn't hold my breath for that."
