body: "Hi,\r\nI was wondering if anyone knew of a program that could rotate individual
  letters while keeping the previous and proceeding letters intact? I know that Photolettering
  used to do it, but I have not found a program yet that can, and I was hoping someone
  here could help me with this.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRodrigue Planck"

    rotation (and manipulation) of letters is all you are after, I recommend using

    letters or groups of letters within a text without going to outlines, so you can
    keep all the editable qualities of the text. You can also adjust tracking and

    you rotate just one charachter and keep the rest \"normal\", I may have to look
    into LaTex (call my dermotlogist.)  \r\n\r\nWhere and how in PM, because of all
    the programs listed here, it is the one that I could produce with.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
    you to everyone so far."
