  point me to anything well known where it has been used. I have to do a presentation
  about it. Also does anybody know anything other than whats on the linotype site
  about its creator Fred Lambert?  Any interesting stuff at all on Annlie would be
  gratefully recieved.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Hi, I came across this site whilst googling 'Fred Lambert' to accompany my
    entry on Friends Reunited. Fred was a Typo teacher at the London School of Printing
    and Graphic Art at Back Hill in Clerkenwell when I was a student there in the
    1950's. \r\nHe designed Compacta to be used as a bold face in a narrow area. When
    I used it via Letraset you had to lift it of the sheet onto a screen by wetting
    it and then transfer it to the design. Fred was English and lived in west London
    I believe. The last time I saw him was in Heneky's pub in Old Brompton Road in
    West London in 1968 when he insisted on buying my wife and myself a 'wedding breakfast'
    as we had recently married. Heneky's was a favourite watering hole for the upcoming
    design and art fraternity then, (and I think still is), and many now famous names
    passed through it's doors. Fred was a really nice guy and was very patient with
    all of our laboured attempts at hand lettering. He tended to smoke a lot and always
    wore a corduroy jacket. \r\nHarry Beck the designer of the modern London Underground
    map, and Tom Eckersley the poster designer also taught there at that time."
