body: "I'm rebranding myself really soon, and my company name will potentially be
  called 'Flo' (variation of Flow).\r\n\r\nI already got some great feedback, but
  I was looking for some professional design comments.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMy
  main questions are:\r\n\r\n1- Is this legible? Does it really need to be once the
  potential client already knows my company name?\r\n2- Since the word is so short
  (how I like it) and with the font, can it potentially be mistaken for Arabic writing
  or a symbol?\r\n3- I think the beauty is in the simplicity, I guess it would just
  be a matter of how I'd apply it.\r\n\r\nI'm loving it at the moment, but of course,
  I'm trying not to until I get good feedback and reassurance from a new set of eyes!
  :)\r\n\r\n(forgive the size, I'm using FLONT on Veer)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flo_4107.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Simplicity is clarity :)\r\n\r\nThe only time someone might not be able to read
    it, is if they see Uo instead, but if they know what a cursive f looks like, then
    it shouldn't be an issue."

  body: "I hope it's not too late to add more feedback. For what it's worth.\r\n\r\nSimplicity
    is always potentially good, and it isn't hard to understand why it appeals to
    you so much. You're doing more than hedging for a simple logo / identity; you're
    trying to make a virtue out of applied simplicity.\r\n\r\nRyte. Got it. This is
    good.\r\n\r\nMy gut reaction is that what you've turned out is a little too simple
    for some people and may pass over their heads without registering any kind of
    effect or reaction. I like it, and I love the cyan and white color scheme (very
    contemporary colors), but if I were doing it I would try another hue with hyer
    impact value. Like magenta, for example. Or orange (not burnt orange but a yellow-orange),
    or maybe even indigo. The cyan color is a bit passive and kind-of not really biting
    my cerebellum hard enuff to make me want to know more about what's behind the
    logo.\r\n\r\nAlso try: using a capital <strong>F</strong> (if available) for two
    reasons. 1) To increase the readability / legibility; 2) To make the logo graphically
    stronger. With a capital <strong>F</strong> you'd have less reason to change the
    color and maybe retain the cyan after all.\r\n\r\nIdeally you could try designing
    a capital <strong>F</strong> from the lower case one you're already trialing.
    That way you'd retain the lovely loop tail and still have a capital <strong>F</strong>.\r\n\r\nj

    an orange as well. I was thinking of retaining my current colors which were cyan.
    I am going to explore the colors much more until I find something I'm happy with.\r\n\r\n2-
    The capital for this typeface changes the look dramatically. I would probably
    explore, like you said, adding some elements to make this a nice capital. Do you
    think it would just be a matter of adding 2 horizontal strokes on the ascender?\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nAlso
    I wanted to know about the FLO thing. Do people think of a woman's name as welll?"

    much like \"I'm trying to be cool\".\r\n\r\nOf course, I would change the ligature
    between the 'i' and the 'x', this is just for viewing purposes.\r\n\r\nI agree,

    and generally lovely to look at. The white on cyan looks really good, but you
    could really put it on just about any coloured (or textured) background and it
    would still look just as good. On the other hand, I really think <em>flix</em>
    loses a lot of the charm - the name isn't as strong, and the mark loses the wonderfully
    concise, compact feeling of the original. Stick with <em>flo</em>!\r\n\r\nGreat

  body: "about your name, let it be taken literally.  I om obviously not experienced
    in this so my insight is just an average joe, please treat it that way and just
    consider it for what it is.\r\n\r\nDo you communicate Flo's?  Do you design Flo's?
    \ A sign maker makes signs.  A flo designer designs what?\r\n\r\nI think Flo by
    itself, if it were properly thought out and designed has the potential to stand
    on it's own, but what are you?\r\n\r\nAre you a self-branded designer, are you
    a studio with more than one designer?  Graphic Design? Type design? Web Design?\r\n\r\nI
    unfortunately don't have the pleasure of knowing you yet, so it's not apparent
    to me what it is you do, but if you are going to support the word 'Flo' with another
    word instead of an <em>activity phrase</em>, please make it something so straightforward
    and simple even I would understand it.\r\n\r\nI'll use a generic word of a company
    that may or may not exist, and you tell me which reveals more about who they are
    (just from the name or phrase)\r\n\r\nApex Gear.     or     Apex. Mountain climbing
    equipment.\r\n\r\nIntuishun Communications.    or   Intuishun. web development.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    think the latter are FAR more descriptive, and the 'tagline' should be a simple
    concise description of what it is you do, but don't try to work it into your logo,
    your mark is very stable and self-contained.\r\n\r\nI just ask that you think
    about it and consider the alternatives and see which works best, that's all.\r\n\r\nThis
    has a lot of potential, I'd love to see where it keeps going!"

    consider dropping the top of the f and adding a horizontal swash that crosses
    the l and comes to a nice swoop over the o. I think it will lend balance to the
    design too.\r\n\r\nThought #1: *designflo* to me sounds more interesting than
    *flodesign*\r\nIt also gives me more flow connotation, than flo the waitress.\r\n\r\nThought
    #2: A tag line should do more than explain what your company does, it should give
    your company a voice. \"Flo - Graphics, web & printing\" is like saying: \"MacDonalds
    - Burgers, Fries & Coke.\" I am helping a client with this notion right now, so
    it was on my mind. Give yourself personality.\r\n\r\nThought #3: Design or Graphic
    Design sounds like a profession. Graphics or Graphic Artist, sound like you work
    at a strip mall sign shop. Without \"design\" you are little more than a color
    jocky.\r\n\r\nThought #4: Careful with the cyan + brushscript + round font = this
    exact moment in design time. The best part of this is the logo.\r\n\r\nHave fun!

    sounding.  Otherwise, I would suggest \"DESIGN\" in a light, all-caps, sans-serif
