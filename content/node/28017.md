body: "I've heard somewhere that HDMX table in TTF fonts has some new functions (besides
  containing records about non linear glyphs widths). Does it mean that even if hinting
  \ didn't touch any sidebearings (e.g. cleartype hinting), it is recommended that
  font should include HDMX table?\r\n\r\nSo if hinting moves some of the right sidebearings
  ( e.g. in B/W hinting) and I will not generate HDMX table, this font will not work
  correctly? Or is it that, the font WILL work correctly ( concerning spacing ) but
  will be slower, because it will need to recalculate all moved sidebearings?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time, peter"

  body: "Mike, it was an informal chat with people who work professionally with hinting,
    and they said that they ALWAYS use HDMX table, even when they do not modify the
    sidebearing, because it  has some other functions. Sorry i don't know anything
    more, I've searched for it, found nothing, and that's why I am asking here. But
    if you say that you don't know about any changes, or reasons to use it when the
    sidebearings are not modified, that would also answer my question.\r\n\r\nPeter\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com"
