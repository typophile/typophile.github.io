body: Apparently this company was started in 1898 and they don't have a font for this
  logo. I don't know how true it is, but i have been charged with finding the font
  of this company. A similiar font is [[http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=HAFO-OKLA
  |Oklahoma ]]. Seems to be a fancy Western type?

  body: You can see from the three slightly different e's and two slightly different
    t's that it was hand-drawn. I had a quick look through the western fonts at myfonts
    but nothing struck me as much closer than the one you have found.
