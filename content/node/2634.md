  body: Jan, <BR>Thanks. From what you can see it looks consistent, but it&#39;s too
    bad there is no full preview for that one. WSI isn&#39;t my favorite supplier
    as some of you might remember from earlier rants, but I did pass this info along
    to the ID requestor.  He can decide if he wants to risk his own $7.95 to find
    out if this is really the same font. <BR>
