<p>In other countries than the US, there may be legal recourse. In the meantime, Mr. Nojima and T26 have created an entry onto their permanent Internet records that will be very hard to erase. I certainly can&rsquo;t imagine legitimate font people or designers working with either one now. For shame.</p>

<p>you “can’t copyright an alphabet”</p>

<p>But in some countries, you may register new and original letter designs.</p>

<p>bloody con artist ripoff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my terminology, it is not a &ldquo;ripoff&rdquo;, but rather a forgery by the Monotype method, because, while most lowercase and uppercase letters and most tabular figures are identical in design, there are a few exceptions, e.g. capital &ldquo;K&rdquo;, German &ldquo;ß&rdquo;, the &ldquo;@&rdquo; sign and a few other characters:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/infinity-aeon.jpg">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/infinity-aeon.jpg</a></p>
<p>Yet, another question is, whether &ldquo;Infinity&rdquo; is an original font at all.</p>
<p>More research would be required to decide this question.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s too close to be unintentional. Not one person has the same exact idea for 97% of the alphabet.</p>
<p>Although it is not discussed very often, designers do compete with each other. New genres enter the market (or re-enter) and then in two to three years time you have many types that are competitive with each other. And it makes sense too. If there is a [historic] model- there&rsquo;s always room a new spin- even if it&rsquo;s not old. Its also good for consumers too.</p>
<p>If I like Bureau Grotesque but not the price (700 smackers) or its serious demeanor 
then
Process Type&rsquo;s Maple- but it doesn&rsquo;t have old style figures and maybe too much personality
then
Parry from OurType which is super clean maybe a little too sanitized
then
I have to wait for National Grotesque from KLIM which has a little Akzidenz in it but if want more Swiss 
then
Endurance Pro from Ascender Corp which is super affordable and reminds me of&hellip;</p>
<p>I think you get the idea! Inspired- but not a copy nor a forgery. So since this is an obvious copy I wonder if he just customized Infinity to his liking and mistakingly reasoned he could sell his modified copy. And just for arguments sake- What inspired Infinity? Is Infinity based on a type that has a structure/skeleton just so that we could say two people looking at the same source could get &lsquo;inspired&rsquo; to created a techie sans with a similar look much in same way my examples above seem to?</p>
<p>I hope all is worked out soon,</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Raph, a note: Frutiger referred to Futura when designing Avenir (hence the name). Gotham is derived directly from building signage in New York City, hence its name. It shares some traits with Avenir, but I doubt H+F-J even referred to Avenir in the development of Gotham. The major difference is the x-height.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello all. It has been interesting to read the lively discussion here.</p>
<p>Murray is a long-standing and repeat customer of Village, and previously Thirstype. He has licensed several of our faces, and has provided valuable feedback and insights. Yes, he has a gruff manner and an&hellip; &ldquo;unedited&rdquo; prose style, but he&rsquo;s a good guy. He emailed me yesterday to point out the similarities of Aeon to Infinity, and asked if I thought it was appropriate for him to post on this site. I didn&rsquo;t see why not, and told him I had no objections.</p>
<p>I immediately leapt into action myself, contacting both MyFonts and T-26, and receiving quick replies from each concerning the matter. In fact, the Aeon typeface has already been removed from the T-26 site, and should hopefully be wiped from the MyFonts database shortly.</p>
<p>To address Uli&rsquo;s question about the originality of Infinity. The face was originally designed at Thirst as part of a new identity for the modem manufacturer USRobotics in late 2000. The process is documented in the book &ldquo;Emotion As Promotion&rdquo;: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1580930972/qid=1108143698/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-1457986-3499327?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1580930972/qid=1108143698/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-1457986-3499327?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846</a></p>

<p>I have been discussing this with Chester in a very friendly way since we learned of it. We have had a good relationship with Chester for many years (as we try with all others) and plan to keep it that way.</p>
<p>We had no idea that this font was a rip-off. It is practically impossible to know of every situation, or to know, or control what designers do.</p>
<p>We can only react responsibly as soon as we can, as we did here, and, of course, have already removed it from our offering. I hope this lowers the temperature here. It is really not necessary to start off on a negative. Best to all.</p>

<p>I agree with Carlos that there was no need for such a harsh tone right off the bat. It&rsquo;s important to point these things out, but to leap to insults is unnecessary. It reminds me of the guy I kinda know who was running around yelling &ldquo;someone stole my cell phone&rdquo; when it was in his bag and he just couldn&rsquo;t find it.</p>

<p>The discussion about Futura/Avenir/Gotham is another interesting one to have, but maybe we won&rsquo;t go into it in depth here. To me, it is self-evident that Gotham references Avenir. The &ldquo;G&rdquo; alone has that distinctive Adrian Frutiger form, and if you look at the lowercase you&rsquo;ll find that the only letter that&rsquo;s structurally different is the &lsquo;k&rsquo; (Avenir has a symmetrical right part, like Univers, while Gotham&rsquo;s bottom leg meets the top leg partway). Futura is significantly different from both others: single story &lsquo;a&rsquo;, tail of &lsquo;g&rsquo; curves up, tails of &lsquo;j&rsquo; and &lsquo;y&rsquo; are straight, top of &lsquo;r&rsquo; curls to 1:30 (it&rsquo;s noon on both Gotham and Avenir), top bowl of &rsquo;s' is much smaller than bottom, bottom of &rsquo;t' is straight, &lsquo;u&rsquo; has no right stem, and apexes of &lsquo;v&rsquo; and &lsquo;w&rsquo; are pointy.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s a bad thing, quite the contrary. H&amp;FJ have created something that&rsquo;s a little bit new and different, and (by taking the challenge of increasing the x-height) definitely a lot better for some uses. That is a fine standard for type designers to aspire toward.</p>

<p>Nick, would you care to elaborate on your insinutation about Myriad?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that everyone knows (including Mr. Phinney) what is meant by &ldquo;like microsoft (segoe) or adobe (myriad)&rdquo;, because Myriad (vs. Frutiger)</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/ssi.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/ssi.pdf</a></p>
<p>is in the same category as</p>
<p>Segoe (vs. Frutiger)
Veracity (vs. Utopia),
Aeon (vs. Infinity),
Waldorfschrift (vs. FF-Liant)</p>
<p>etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>While Mr. Segura frankly admits that Aeon is a &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo; (and without delay removes this forgery from his website), Mr. Phinney would never have the courage to admit that Myriad is a &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo;, nor would Mr. Gates ever have the courage to admit that Segoe is a &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo; of Frutiger, despite the incontestable and non-appealable decision, that Segoe and Frutiger are &ldquo;considered identical&rdquo; (denoting in legalese that Segoe is a rip-off).</p>

<p>Since the legal notion of <cite>&ldquo;considered identical&rdquo;</cite> (as used in the Segoe decision) ignores minutiae, it is useless, from the legal point of view, to point to such details as e.g. that the Myriad-i has a round dot and that the Frutiger-i has as square dot.</p>
<p>The only legally relevant criterion is the &ldquo;show-through effect&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Typophilers are so very much specialized and so very much devoted to minutiae that they are usually not able to experience the show-through effect. Therefore it is necessary to explain the show-through effect to typophilers with reference to other intellectual works, for instance with reference to poetical works.</p>
<p>Have a look at the following poem:</p>
<p><strong>Lion Lion, burning bright, 
In the deserts of the night; 
What immortal arm or eye, 
Could make thy dreadful symmetry?</strong></p>
<p>If you are familiar with English poetry, you will almost instantaneously experience the show-through effect while you are reading the above poem. What does this effect mean?</p>
<p>Of course the words &ldquo;Lion Lion&rdquo; not only &ldquo;look significantly different&rdquo;, but ARE &ldquo;significantly different&rdquo; as compared with the two words in the original poem, and the words &ldquo;deserts&rdquo;, &ldquo;arm&rdquo;, &ldquo;make&rdquo;, and &ldquo;dreadful&rdquo; are also &ldquo;significantly different&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the original poem shows through, when you read the above forgery. Therefore it is not necessary that I quote the original poem for comparison, because you instantaneously know the original poem which shows through here. This is called the show-through effect.</p>
<p>Exactly the same show-through effect is experienced by non-typophilers, if they are accustomed to read texts typeset in Frutiger and suddenly see a text typeset in Myriad. Of course, non-typophilers do not know the name Frutiger and do not know the name Myriad, but if they have read many texts typeset in Frutiger, they will spontaneously think that it is the same Frutiger typeface, if they are presented with a text typeset in Myriad. This means that Frutiger shows through in texts typeset in Myriad, and hence Myriad from the legal point of view is &ldquo;considered identical&rdquo; with Frutiger, even though several letters of the alphabet are not fully identical in design.</p>
<p>(Note: The term &ldquo;show-through&rdquo; is also used in the paper industry denoting that a text shows through from the reverse side of thin printing papers.)</p>

you seem like a passionate woman, but I&rsquo;m a little confused. The &ldquo;show-through effect&rdquo; that you are talking about — or maybe are making up? — is called the latin alphabet. The comparison that Thomas Phinney posted shows the differences between Myriad and Frutiger which are to my eyes, just as clear as the differences between Univers and Helvetica.</p>

That&rsquo;s the first thing. Then, there is the fact that tiny differences in the shapes can bring important differences in the rythm of the text so i think you can&rsquo;t compare  type with poems.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>All a supposed &lsquo;show-through effect&rsquo; would demonstrate in the case of Myriad and Frutiger (and it should be noted that no such effect has been demonstrated in a legal contest) is what I stated at the time of the Segoe UI issue: that the genre of sans serif type typified by Frutiger is too narrow to admit many other members. It would not demonstrate intent by Adobe to create a clone of Frutiger.</p>
<p>I happen to think that Myriad is sufficiently different from Frutiger to constitute a legitimate, original design: one that further reduces the options for originality within this narrow genre of type design. As I have stated before, I think Segoe UI is too close to Frutiger for comfort (but this is something of a non-issue now, since Monotype Imaging now owns the rights to both typefaces).</p>
<p>I find the argument that typographers are too specialised in their knowledge and experience to make these judgements, and that they need to be shown the show-through effect, problematic. What is the value of the opinion of the person who &lsquo;spontaneously thinks that Myriad is Frutiger&rsquo;, given that the value put on type is entirely determined by ability to distinguish between different typefaces? What is the control in this experiment? What if the same person spontaneously thinks that Frutiger is Univers, or Myriad is Gill Sans? Does that mean that all these types are to be considered legally identical? Or that the test is unreliable?</p>
<p>The question of value suggests a different test: whether an experienced typographer finds it worthwhile to purchase both typefaces, instead of just one and, even more importantly, whether he uses them in distinctive ways, i.e. whether he finds value in their distinctive features. I have had, at various times, access to Myriad Pro and three different versions of Frutiger (including Frutiger Next in which the unskilled &lsquo;non-typophiler&rsquo; might detect the show-through effect of Myriad italic!), and have never found one design to be a useful substitute for the other. On that basis I judge them to be sufficiently distinct and to have independent value. On the other hand, I can&rsquo;t imagine using Segoe UI for any purpose that I wouldn&rsquo;t by preference use Frutiger (other than for technical or linguistic reasons relating to e.g. format, hinting and character set coverage).</p>
<p>To say that the details are unimportant in anything related to design is to risk undermining the whole. As Charles Eames famously said &lsquo;The details are not the details. They make the product.&rsquo; And that is as true of type design as it is of furniture design, another field beset by unauthorised copying. The problem with relying on the opinion of people who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between an Eames chair manufactured to the exacting standards of the original design and a knock-off version is that the same person is going to buy the knock-off because it is cheaper. Effectively, you&rsquo;ve created a legal environment in which educating people about design and quality becomes contrary to the interests of designers and manufacturers, because they are going to rely on people who are ignorant and are not going to pay for quality to be unable to tell the difference between two products in a legal contest, rather than relying on a knowledgeable, educated person to accurately describe the ways in which the two products are similar or distinct. This means that the legal interests of designers and manufacturers now run contrary to their normal commercial interests, which are to educate the market and increase the number of people who value the quality of the originals. That&rsquo;s a crazy situation.</p>

<p>Is it legal for someone to reference the Liant digital font files and create derivative works as it seems here?</p>
<p>Or in order for it to be legal would the creator of Waldorfschrift had to have a sketch pad and draw every letter he saw on the front of the building of the Weleda cosmetics company or hair dye bottle and then go digitize his sketches? ( Like Loki Cola might have&hellip; a CokaCola looking font)</p>
<p>As for Myriad&hellip;</p>
<p>I refuse to believe that during the brainstorming/strategy phase taking place at some conference table at Adobe that the Frutiger types did not come up.  I have to agree with Uli- Myriad is very close to Frutiger. There are new details but ultimately its derivative.</p>
<p>But just because its derivative does it make a forgery though?</p>

<p>Point well taken. Heck, if we couldn&rsquo;t use derivatives of other fonts, then we would have one sans (maybe two, geometric and humanist) one serif (or three, garalde, transitional and modern) a slab, a black letter or three, a script or three, and a couple hundred display faces &hellip; and if a sans font has flames coming out of it &hellip; that would make it a derivative too, wouldn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>Copying, as in the original post is wrong. Improving and building on the work of the past is a scientific principle, and one that should be considered a base for typography as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Hudson, as often, made some valuable contributions to this thread which are worth a more detailed discussion. In order not to digress too much from the topic, I will select here only his statement about who is to decide whether two fonts are to be &ldquo;considered identical&rdquo; or not. In this connection, he mentions</p>
<p>&ldquo;experienced typographer&rdquo;,
&ldquo;knowledgeable, educated person&rdquo;
&ldquo;designers and manufacturers&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as Europe is concerned, the situation is a follows: Six years ago, in December 2001, a &ldquo;Council Regulation&rdquo; was published, the legal text of which is reprinted here</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/segoe4.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/segoe4.pdf</a> (see page 2, section 14)</p>
<p>For your convenience, I quote here this section 14:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The assessment as to whether a design has individual character should be based on whether the <strong>overall impression</strong> produced on an <strong>informed user</strong> viewing the design clearly differs from that produced on him by the existing design corpus, taking into consideration the nature of the product to which the design is applied or in which it is incorporated, and in particular the industrial sector to which it belongs and the degree of freedom of the designer in developing the design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two important legal notions are &ldquo;overall impression&rdquo; and &ldquo;informed user&rdquo;. In the legal discussion preceding the above final &ldquo;Council Regulation&rdquo;, three types of persons were discussed:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;ordinary consumer&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;informed user&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;design expert&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>The Council selected the middle term &ldquo;informed user&rdquo;. For instance, the &ldquo;informed user&rdquo; of typefaces would be for example the production man in a school book publishing house who selects &ldquo;Myriad&rdquo; for the chapter titles and &ldquo;Minion&rdquo; for the body text of a new schoolbook. This means that the &ldquo;informed user&rdquo; is neither a &ldquo;bloody layman&rdquo; (e.g. his grandma), nor a &ldquo;design expert&rdquo;, for instance a font designer (who may or may not be found at the Typophile website).</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, it was Luc Devroye who estimated that there are only about 300 type designers worldwide, and if this estimate is correct then the group of &ldquo;design experts&rdquo; (in the sense of &ldquo;font design experts&rdquo;) is much too small as compared with the large group of the &ldquo;informed users&rdquo; working in printing plants, publishing houses, advertising agencies, etc.</p>
<p>The other important legal notion is &ldquo;overall impression&rdquo;. This means, as far as fonts are concerned, that you must abstract from (minor) details of single letters and must view the &ldquo;overall impression&rdquo; instead. The &ldquo;overall impression&rdquo;, in my personal view, is very hazy, and I do not like it very much, but it must be accepted as the law in most European countries. The term &ldquo;show-through&rdquo; (in German the term &ldquo;Durchscheinen&rdquo; coined by a famous German copyright expert named Ulmer) is connected with the term &ldquo;overall impression&rdquo;. Here again we may explain the term with reference to the Blake poem:</p>
<p>Such words as &ldquo;lion&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tyger&rdquo; etc. are (minor) details, because the &ldquo;overall impression&rdquo; of the above mutilated poem still makes it possible that the original poem &ldquo;shows through&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Concerning Myriad vs. Frutiger and Segoe vs. Frutiger this means: Does the &ldquo;informed user&rdquo; come to the conclusion that Frutiger &ldquo;shows through&rdquo;, if he or she abstracts from the (minor) details and only compares the &ldquo;overall impression&rdquo; of the two fonts? For Segoe vs. Frutiger, this was confirmed by the legal decision quoted in this thread. For Myriad vs. Frutiger, I am of opinion that the same decision would be made by the Invalidity Division, if Adobe tried to register &ldquo;Myriad&rdquo; as &ldquo;community design&rdquo;. But you cannot be sure, because the decision (&ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;) depends upon the court and upon the judge and upon whether the judge had a delicious or an awful breakfast in the morning of the judgement day :-)</p>

<p>I think the other important legal notion in the cited council regulation is &lsquo;taking into consideration the nature of the product to which the design is applied or in which it is incorporated&rsquo;. This implies taking into account the nature of typography, and I would argue that this limits the suitability of the &lsquo;overall impression&rsquo; test, since it is in the nature of typography to be concerned with details. This is why I suggest that a test based on perceived value is more reliable (not least because it can be confirmed by people pulling out their wallets) and also directly reflects the fundamental economic issue that gives rise to intellectual property litigation, i.e. illegitimate competition. So I maintain that the basic test of distinctiveness between two typefaces is whether an &lsquo;informed user&rsquo; is willing to spend money to license both, i.e. whether he finds independent value in each typeface such that each is desirable. Of course, informed users may disagree, but then they may also disagree about the overall impression.</p>
<p><em>For instance, the “informed user” of typefaces would be for example the production man in a school book publishing house who selects “Myriad” for the chapter titles and “Minion” for the body text of a new schoolbook.</em></p>
<p>That sounds like a very reasonable definition of &lsquo;informed&rsquo;. But I wouldn&rsquo;t hire someone for that job who couldn&rsquo;t readily tell the difference between Frutiger and Myriad. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Berkson:</p>
<p><cite>In theory Frutiger could sue Monotype for royalties from the revenue from Segoe, no?</cite></p>
<p>The question is a very theoretical legal question, but nontheless, the clear answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the decision of the Invalidity Division was not fully understood by everyone, otherwise you would not ask your question.</p>
<p>At the time in December 2004, when the Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (please note that the applicant was neither Linotype nor Monotype) applied to the Invalidity Division to invalidate the Community Design &ldquo;Segoe&rdquo; registered by the Microsoft Corporation, the legal situation was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The design of the old typeface Frutiger created decades ago was no longer protected and had already entered into public domain, so that even the Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG, which at that time fully owned the Linotype GmbH, was not permitted to register the public domain typeface Frutiger as a &ldquo;new&rdquo; European Community Design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Microsoft Corporation (or rather Monotype and later Ascender) made a forgery of the public domain Frutiger design, renamed this forgery to &ldquo;Segoe&rdquo; and illegally registered the Segoe design alias Frutiger design as &ldquo;new&rdquo; European Community Design thus deceiving the Design Office. (Incidentally, anyone, e.g you or me, could apply for the invalidation of an illegal registration, because it is in the interest of the public that no illegal forgeries of designs such as &ldquo;Segoe&rdquo; etc. are registered.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Linotype and the Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG learnt that Microsoft had made an illegal registration of the public domain Frutiger design renamed to Segoe in order to deceive the Design Office in Spain, the Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG applied to the Invalidity Division in Spain to invalidate the Community Design &ldquo;Segoe&rdquo; registered by the Microsoft Corporation on the grounds that the public domain design Frutiger and the design of the forgery Segoe are &ldquo;considered identical&rdquo;, and hence the Invalidity Division invalidated the illegal design registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now the answer to your question &ldquo;In theory Frutiger could sue Monotype for royalties from the revenue from Segoe, no?&rdquo; is an easy one: Since the design of the old Frutiger font had already entered into public domain, the designer Frutiger himself lost any design rights into his own design, and therefore cannot sue Microsoft nor Monotype nor any other font forging company, which made forgeries of his Frutiger design, for royalties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is presumed that the designer Frutiger still gets royalties resulting from the sale of his public domain font Frutiger, but such royalty payments are based only on contractual agreements and not on the design law, because the latter does not apply to public domain designs, hence the designer Frutiger could not sue Microsoft for royalties for the Segoe font.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The expression &ldquo;product to which the design is applied or in which it is incorporated&rdquo; only means the combination of a design, e.g. a logo, with a product, e.g. a leather belt.</p>
<p>Fonts are separate designs not applied to or incorporated into a product. Installing a font in Windows could -only theoretically- be interpreted as &ldquo;incorporating the design into the product&rdquo;, but this is certainly not meant by the above definition.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;overall impression&rdquo; regulation is obligatory and cannot be overruled, but there is this exception:</p>
<p>As regards the expression &ldquo;taking into consideration the nature of the product&rdquo;, an example would be a font specifically designed for such products as the cell phone display. Here the &ldquo;nature of the product&rdquo;, i.e. the little LCD display on the cell phone, may have so low pixel resolution that even a font with very simple design would have to be regarded as original design by &ldquo;taking into consideration the nature of the product&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Myriad is close to Frutiger, especially when one considers that when it was published, the only other typeface remotely like that was Adsans (little known). 
In the context of this thread, I&rsquo;d say that the difference between Aeon and Infinity is of the same order as the difference between Frutiger and Myriad.
So if we Typophiles can get all worked up about Aeon, why do we turn a blind eye to Myriad?
Firstly, because it is published by Adobe.
Secondly, because it is by designers who have produced many completely original faces.
Thirdly, because it is so well done: there is a double standard, where we may be prepared to accept skillful derivatives, because they add to the original, but not poorly executed efforts. 
Reputation counts for a lot.</p>

<p>Uli, thank you for posting the information about the German law and the public domain status there of designs like Frutiger. That&rsquo;s considerably more helpful, I think, than trying to use a purely artistic analogy like a Blake poem in the domain of something that&rsquo;s part art and part functional.</p>

<p>There is possibility that Chank licensed a copy from FontShop to make specialized version for a client.</p>
<p>Dalton Maag did this when they made a &lsquo;regularized&rsquo; version of FF Just Left Hand for a client of theirs:
<a href="http://www.daltonmaag.com/about/modification/case_studies/cruk.html">http://www.daltonmaag.com/about/modification/case_studies/cruk.html</a></p>
<p>For Uli- If Chank did not license Scala for modification is it still legal? Is Scala a public domain design already? How long does it take for a design become public domain- in the US and abroad?</p>
<p>Nick you hit the nail on the head! I find it ironic too- Myriad is patent pending too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Heptonstall:</p>
<p><cite>I got sent a font called ‘Full Life Sans’ by a US-based medical equipment company and told “This is our custom-designed corporate typeface”</cite></p>
<p>Mr. Diaz:</p>
<p><cite>For Uli- If Chank did not license Scala for modification is it still legal? Is Scala a public domain design already? How long does it take for a design become public domain- in the US and abroad?</cite></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My recommendation for the American Typophile website is that they badly need an independent American design law and copyright law expert, who is not affiliated with a certain font company, for answering legal questions, because there seems to be much need among Typophilers for reliable legal information in these matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Is Scala a public domain design already?&quot;</cite></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This would be such a question which should be submitted to an independent American design law expert. My answer as a German with only a flimsy knowledge of American law (but with some knowledge of German law) is: To the best of my knowledge, typeface designs are not protectible by US laws and hence, as far as I know, must be regarded as public domain in the USA.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><cite>&ldquo;How long does it take for a design become public domain- in the US and abroad?&quot;</cite></li>
</ol>
<p>(a) In the USA, a typeface design, as far as I know, becomes public domain on the day, when it is published, because, as far as I know, the design of typefaces is not protectible.</p>
<p>(c) As regards Germany, I can give a reliable answer: In Germany (and several other European countries), the design of a typeface (the British legal expression is &ldquo;typopographic typeface&rdquo;) may be protected for a maximum period of 25 years, if the design is new and original AND if the design is registered at the design patent office within the first year of making public the new and original typeface.</p>
<p>(d) As far as FF Scala is concerned, I could not find any registration for any of the FF fonts of the FontFont or FontShop outfit in the electronic files of the design patent office. This means that apparently none of the FF Fonts have ever been registered with the consequence that none of the FF Fonts are protected by the design law. No registration, no protection. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. So, the answer is, that FF Scala entered into public domain in the same year, when in was first published.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>As regards the &ldquo;US-based medical equipment company&rdquo; Medtronic, I have here temporarily uploaded an old nice sarcastic caricature which appeared at that time of the criminal court law proceedings:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/dough.jpg">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/dough.jpg</a></p>
<p>depicting a would-be heart surgeon in hand-cuffs with a lot of &ldquo;dough&rdquo; (= bank notes in legalese) in his hands.</p>
<p>The background to this legal affair is as follows:</p>
<p>In Germany there was a huge &ldquo;heart valve scandal&rdquo; involving also the Medtronic outfit, whose sales manager for Germany got a one-year &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; (= imprisonment fine in legalese) for having given &ldquo;nice monetary presents&rdquo; to heart surgeons in order to &ldquo;convince them&rdquo; (&ldquo;bribe them&rdquo; in legalese) that they should buy Medtronic heart valves instead of the valves of the competitors.</p>
<p>Germans may read the old news item, e.g. here and at other websites:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article530332/Herzklappenskandal.html">http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article530332/Herzklappenskandal.html</a></p>
<p>There have been no less than 1500 criminal proceedings against numerous heart surgeons in many hospitals all over Germany. For instance, the chief heart surgeon in my hometown Heidelberg received the nice &ldquo;gift&rdquo; of more than 50000 Euro for &ldquo;research purposes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, as regards the forgery &ldquo;Full Life Sans&rdquo;, is becomes apparent that the Medtronic outfit, whose German sales manager had enough &ldquo;dough&rdquo; (money in legalese) at his disposal to make heart surgeons happy by presenting to them nice money gifts, will most certainly also have had enough &ldquo;dough&rdquo; to present a nice money gift to a font forger for making a forgery of the FF Scala font.</p>

<p>But to my simplistic eye, the difference between Frutiger and Myriad is molecular. In the real world, what normal human being could possibly tell the difference without a very trained eye? It&rsquo;s like taking a symphony and changing a note here and there, and calling it something new.</p>
<p>I guess by changing a few curves a few degrees and making extraordinarly subtle changes, one can claim originality these days. But it certainly isn&rsquo;t art.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s quality got to do with it? Authorized or not, Medtronic Sans is a consistently, considered derivation, in the manner of Myriad.</p>
<p>As Uli argues, type designs (but not BCPs, of course) are automatically in the public domain, and it is only the court of professional opinion that censures piracy.</p>
<p>So that court, as recently convened on this thread, has judged Aeon and Medtronic Sans guilty, yet for being the kind of fonts that do what Myriad does. Aeon has been sentenced, and the sentence enacted. Meanwhile Myriad is a typeface that practically everyone uses, and is not considered unethical by the design community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not condoning or condemning anything, except perhaps an institutionalized double standard, for the whole thing is extremely grey, and every type designer has, ultimately, to rely on their own discretion when developing fonts that are revivals, derivatives, or similar to typefaces by other type designers.</p>
<p>Those who are best able to form an objective opinion are type designers, and are unlikely to speak out, as it&rsquo;s bad form to throw one&rsquo;s peers under the bus, and few indeed are the type designers who have not blatantly copied another&rsquo;s work, in the guise of a revival.</p>

<p>Typefaces (and we are talking about design issues here, not technical or format issues, so let&rsquo;s avoid the term &lsquo;font&rsquo;) are designs incorporated into typography. Typography is the product. You proposed the example of an informed user being used to reading pages of text in Frutiger being presented with text in Myriad and thinking it was Frutiger. <em>Pages of text:</em> that is the product into which the design of a typeface is incorporated. Indeed, I would argue that type, far from being a separate design not applied or incorporated into a product, has no separate meaningful existence outside of typography, it exists in order to be incorporated into typography. The distinctive nature of individual typeface designs have their value in the distinctiveness that they bring to typographic design, i.e. design with type, and this is why the question of value is a good indicator of the distinctiveness of type designs. Again: if an informed user, such as the book production person you described, finds it worthwhile to spend money on both Frutiger and Myriad, that is a concrete measure of their distinctiveness and independent value.</p>

<p>In the USA, a typeface is protectable by design patent for a period of 14 years from the date of registration. Design patent is a special class of patent protection, and like all patent protection it requires the designer/inventor to apply for and register the patent.</p>
<p>So there is no copyright protection for typeface design in the USA (although there is for fonts as computer programs), and there is no automatic protection for new designs, but it is incorrect to say that there is no protection or to assume that any typeface design is automatically in the public domain.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s begging the question, Nick. Surely the issue is <em>what Myriad does.</em></p>
<p>Since the concept of &lsquo;overall impression&rsquo; seems so important, let me state that even in a comparison of a single word &ndash; your Frutiger/Frutiger image &ndash; the overall impression I get is that Myriad is a softer, more flowing design than Frutiger, that the differences in design details &lsquo;make the product&rsquo; (to use Eames' phrase) and the Myriad product has a different overall character to the Frutiger product despite the similarities of letterform architecture. I believe you are more committed to the idea of type presenting a mood or a feeling than I am, so I am surprised that you do not find this difference in overall impact &ndash; the softness and gentleness of Myriad compared to Frutiger &ndash; significant. It is the reason why I would not consider the two designs exchangeable and why I would use both but for different kinds of projects.</p>
<p>PS. If you include Adsans in the same design category as Frutiger and Myriad, then I think you definitely need to include Stone Sans, which is much closer to Frutiger and Myriad than Adsans and, for obvious reasons, must be considered influential in the design of Myriad. I consider Myriad as occupying the middle-ground between Frutiger and Stone Sans, in the narrow field of this particular genre of sans serif types.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Hudson:</p>
<p><cite>In the USA, a typeface is protectable by design patent for a period of 14 years from the date of registration. Design patent is a special class of patent protection, and like all patent protection it requires the designer/inventor to apply for and register the patent.</cite></p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I read the US design law which is called &ldquo;Patent for Designs&rdquo; and which is incorporated as three short sections 171 through 173 into the overall American &ldquo;Patent Laws&rdquo;, but I could not find any special provisions for typefaces.</p>
<p>This is crucial in my opinion, for the US design law is restricted to <strong>&ldquo;the design for an article of manufacture&rdquo;</strong>. This &ldquo;article of manufacture&rdquo; must really exist as a specific product or commodity, whereas a typeface exists per se as a &ldquo;scheme of ornamentation&rdquo; and is not inseparably attached to a specific &ldquo;article of manufacture&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For instance, the situation is entirely different for the typographical logo &ldquo;Marlboro&rdquo; specifically designed for and inseparably attached to the cigarette packet as &ldquo;article of manufacture&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But a typeface is nothing but a collection of separate letters, where even the sequence of these letters is not predefined in the sense of specific words (such as &ldquo;Marlboro&rdquo;), let alone of specific texts and let alone of two-dimensional arrangements of these letters on an &ldquo;article of manufacture&rdquo; such as a cigarette packet or a beer bottle or whatever other commodity.</p>
<p>Regulation 171 runs as follows:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Whoever invents any new, original, and ornamental design <strong>for an article of manufacture</strong> may obtain a patent therefore, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.</cite></p>
<p>We read at the US patent website</p>
<p><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/1500_1504_01.htm">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/1500_1504_01.htm</a></p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Design is inseparable from the article to which it is applied, and cannot exist alone merely as a scheme of ornamentation. It must be a definite preconceived thing, capable of reproduction, and not merely the chance result of a method or of a combination of functional elements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A claim to a picture, print, impression, etc. per se, that is not applied to or embodied in an article of manufacture should be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 171 as directed to nonstatutory subject matter.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>So, could you please explain to me, where there exists for you, for instance in the case of &ldquo;Myriad&rdquo;, the &ldquo;definite preconceived thing&rdquo;, the &ldquo;specific article of manufacture&rdquo;, the &ldquo;specific product&rdquo; to which &ldquo;Myriad&rdquo; is inseparately fixed.</p>
<p>(By the way: In Germany, we had the same legal problem at the time, when the old German design law did not contain specific provisions for typefaces, so that typefaces, a couple of decades ago, were practically not protected under the old design law on account of the reasons stated above for the US design law.)</p>

<p>Same letterforms, different finish.</p>
<p>Aeon is like Myriad in that respect, it is softer than Infinity, with rounder curves and smoother joints.</p>
<p><em>I am surprised that you do not find this difference in overall impact — the softness and gentleness of Myriad compared to Frutiger — significant.</em></p>
<p>This is probably where we differ. I don&rsquo;t think this kind of subtle gloss is significant enough to constitute a new typeface, given that the letterform architecture is fundamentally the same.</p>
<p><em>I would not consider the two designs exchangeable</em></p>
<p>That is not the acid test for singularity; the architecture of two faces may yet be the same, despite differences in finish that give them quite different tonalitites.</p>

<p>That’s not a great argument, Miguel. The release year of Helvetica and Univers make it pretty clear that they were in development simultaneously (and I think Univers started first). And both faces are pretty clearly derived from Akzidenz.</p>

<p>Because the grotesque form was well established, and Helvetica was not an original design, but an adaptation of Akzidenz Grotesk. So Univers was designed within a genre. (And within that genre, Akzidenz Grotesk, Helvetica, and Arial are all the same typeface &ndash; in the same way that there are different cuts of Garamond.)</p>
<p>However, the Frutiger typeface was a genuine innovation, right down to its letterforms, directly attributable to Adrian Frutiger.
BTW, I don&rsquo;t think, and I&rsquo;ve never said, that Myriad is a copy of Frutiger. I&rsquo;m merely pointing out the architecture is fundamentally the same. Surely you can&rsquo;t disagree with that?</p>
<p>There is some difference between starting with someone else&rsquo;s typeface and modifying away from it, and starting from scratch and ending up with something similar to an existing face. I suspect our understanding of that process is why we&rsquo;re critical of Aeon and Medtronic, but not, perhaps, Myriad, although from a purely physical inspection, they appear to be equally derivative.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m glad Miguel posted those images and saved me the trouble.</p>
<p>There is another thread going on about Tschichold and modernism, and I think this is an enlightening illustration of how modernism can create havoc with our notions of creativity and originality. If modernism endeavors to strip away ornamentation and reduce everything to pure functionality, how can anyone create anything modern without violating some previous creation? How many different ways are there to design a knife or fork? If one goes out to buy a set of flatware, one doesn&rsquo;t consider how only the forks are different, but how the spoons and knives are different too, right? I think typefaces are the same in that they are captive to their function, and especially so when ornamentation is reduced. When I look at Frutiger and Myriad, I see two different approaches to the same functional idea. Most of us here appreciate the differences between Helvetica and Univers, and I would say that the Frutiger/Myriad comparison is about the same in that they are two distinct approaches to a functional category that has already been pretty well distilled. In this context, the differences that are there, such as the tail of the lowercase y, are quite significant, non-trivial aspects to Myriad&rsquo;s personality.</p>
<p>Remember, also, that Myriad (being &ldquo;modern&rdquo;) is a product of its function, and that it was conceived as a multiple master typeface. That technology is greatly responsible for the appearance of Myriad, I think. I also think that Myriad&rsquo;s own characteristics are more evident at the ends of its dynamic range, not in the middle &ndash; not to mention the italic design, which I would argue is rightly half of the entire Myriad design, making it even more distinctive and original overall.</p>
<p>So, in other words, Myriad in its entirety &ndash; with the hundreds of possible instances from its original MM release, and with its italic design &ndash; is certainly different from Frutiger.</p>
<p>Oh, and Myriad does have a U.S. design patent.</p>

<p>Sure, and no one is contesting that. Now you can&rsquo;t disagree that Myriad brings novelty to that design category, and that&rsquo;s what makes it a different design within the same theme.</p>

<p>No, I don&rsquo;t. But what&rsquo;s wrong about having the same architecture. There are dozens of typefaces out there that share the same structure. Does that make them all the same, or does it make them be part of the same genre?</p>

<p>From a practical and social standpoint, post WWI Central-European modernism was not concerned with individual creativity. It was a pragmatic design theory, focused on producing practical output for mass consumption. I don’t get the impression that Tschichold and co. cared as much about anything new being created as they did about being active in the restoration of Europe.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m interested in intellectual property, and I wonder about the line that divides originality from plagiarism, and how it&rsquo;s drawn.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;a functional category that has already been pretty well distilled.</em></p>
<p>Modernism isn&rsquo;t a catch-all category. Futura, for instance, is quite different from Frutiger. And neither typeface is the discovery of a modernist truth, they are inventions, unique distillations.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;it was conceived as a multiple master typeface. That technology is greatly responsible for the appearance of Myriad&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Yes, that might explain things. I remember when it was released, and the specimen Adobe produced packed with its many instances, really exciting. The Multiple Master stuff was a distraction from being more circumspect about the basic type design. New technology has a way of devaluing old skills.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>Modernism isn’t a catch-all category.</cite></p>
<p>I was not referring to Modernism there, but the specific category that is inhabited by Frutiger and Myriad &ndash; &ldquo;humanist sans serif&rdquo; or whatever you want to call it. What I meant was that it is a fairly distinct design category that is often referred to as such, implying that it is more than just a single design (e.g. Frutiger). If we accept that Frutiger is in a design category that is not the same as that of Helvetica or Gill Sans, then it follows that (a) some other typeface can inhabit the same category, and (b) the category is narrow enough that different designs within it would be very similar.</p>
<p>This sounds legalistic, but I think it&rsquo;s a pretty common way of seeing typeface designs. Typeface designers are almost always constrained by this problem &ndash; the limited choices available within a category &ndash; so I think we all have to be careful and thoughtful about how we consider it. If we haven&rsquo;t already been there, we probably will be sooner or later, and we&rsquo;ll depend on our peers to trust and understand that our intentions are good.</p>
<p>The suspicion and cynicism with which some view the Myriad design really does not reconcile with what I know and have experienced. I think it should be viewed as an earnest attempt to contribute something new and interesting to the typographic canon. I personally think it succeeds in that.</p>

<p><cite>&ldquo;Oh, and Myriad does have a U.S. design patent.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>The Segoe design patent registration was invalidated, since it was illegal. And the same invalidation would also take place concerning the illegal design patent registration of Myriad, if someone, e.g. a competitor in the font industry, would apply for its invalidation. (But since Linotype sells Myriad and Adobe sells Frutiger, where are the competitors?)</p>
<p>Please, Mr. Slye, read again carefully, what I said above in the thread. And especially read again regulation 171 of the US Patent Law:</p>
<p>“Whoever invents any <strong>new, original</strong>, and ornamental design <strong>for an article of manufacture</strong> may obtain a patent therefore&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No judge and no court expert, who is &ldquo;sane in the brain&rdquo; (&ldquo;compos mentis&rdquo; in American legalese, see Websters), would ever swear that the typeface Myriad was <strong>&ldquo;new and original&rdquo;</strong>. But the most crucial argument, as I already stated above in the thread, is that you cannot register a design by US law, which is not registered <strong>&ldquo;for an article of manufacture&rdquo;</strong>. And therefore the registration of Myriad was illegal, since it was not registered &ldquo;for an article of manufacture&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here is a few examples of &ldquo;articles of manufacture&rdquo; for which design patents were registered, e.g. for &ldquo;a steering wheel lock, a massage device, a tubeless tire changer, a liquid dispenser container, a tire tread design, an eyeglass display rack, a spice bottle container, a roof shingle, a concrete block for a retaining wall, a femoral hip stem prosthesis, a bottle cap, an armchair, a microwave oven, and a concrete mixer truck&rdquo;, etc.</p>
<p>Now let me know the &ldquo;article of manufacture&rdquo;, for which Myriad was registered.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This thread nicely illustrates that the decision whether a typeface is regarded as belonging to the same genre of typefaces, or as a mere imitation of another typeface, is a matter of perception. Which changes. As long as some typeface is novel in a way or another, and one or two other typefaces imitate these novel features (be that construction, serifs, stem endings), these will be regarded as imitations. As soon as many typefaces imitate these novel features, it turns out that there is a genre &ndash; by looking at typefaces similar in one respect (the one that unites them and makes them belong to one genre) we teach the eye to see more minute details and learn to differentiate within the tight design space of this genre.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello all:</p>
<p>Myriad works well at small text sizes all way up to airport way-finding posters. It has a fabulous repertoire of styles. The &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; that Miguel is speaking of is expressed by its ability to do everything very well. I personally don&rsquo;t see Frutiger that universal (Next negates some of that but anyway). Myriad is too well honed for all its capability to be a traced over but it heavily borrows. Mr. Hudson is right that Myriad has a softer appearance (which I personally prefer). Nevertheless, Myriad vs Frutiger is mentioned time and time again right along with all the other alleged knock-offs, copies, etc.</p>
<p>(Interestingly, Stone Sans is never mentioned in the company of such scandal- this is the first time I hear of it on Typophile. Now this is a design I would considered derivative but not so much that it would make me feel uncomfortable- I see Myriad/Frutiger in there but Stone was drinking the Syntax Kool Aid that morning- okay!)</p>
<p>Karsten you and Nick bring up an interesting point about what really makes a typeface: architecture/skeleton and then serifs, stem modulation etc are added on top of that. In Myriad&rsquo;s case its been argued that its derivative to Frutiger&rsquo;s &lsquo;architecture&rsquo; and for that reason it has been derided.</p>
<p>In the context of new designs: What about a typeface that has a seemingly different architecture but has the same serif treatments. What do we say about it? Another genre?</p>

<p>However, firstly this was only a &ldquo;summary judgment&rdquo; and not a proper court trial, and secondly this was only a district court and not a supreme court. Therefore this &ldquo;summary judgment&rdquo; is of little general value.</p>
<p>What is needed is a supreme court decision based on a real trial with evidence and all such things, so that we know for sure whether typeface designs are protected by the US design law or not.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to avoid accusations and inflamatory language. As Chris said, everybody is well intentioned.
As Karsten said, whether one considers a typeface a rip-off (or whatever) is a matter of opinion, and as I&rsquo;ve said, for type designers at work, a matter of discretion. 
Nonetheless, it should be possible to discuss this in a serious, intelligent manner, whether or not one has vested interests.
I do think Myriad&rsquo;s architecture is close to Frutiger&rsquo;s, but without knowing the process and intent, it would be a mistake to cry foul.</p>
<p>My initial post was sarcastic; but the question remains, if it&rsquo;s OK for Adobe and Microsoft to publish &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; faces, why can&rsquo;t anybody else in the type community, a tyro for instance, without being raked over the coals? I&rsquo;m asking that question not because I come down firmly on either side, but because I want to hear a plausible explanation for why this situation exists.</p>

<p>A typeface has to pass the US P&amp;T Office standards for distinctiveness, and one of the requirements of submitting is that you have to identify &lsquo;prior art&rsquo; that might have inlfuenced the design. The existence of prior art doesn&rsquo;t mean that the patent will not be granted, only that the patent examiners will pay particular attention to the relationship of the new design to the prior art.</p>

<p>Again, the acid test of singularity isn&rsquo;t either architectural or tonal: it is value. Are the two types distinct enough for someone to find them independently valuable, i.e. independently useful and hence worth purchasing both.</p>
<p>Architecturally, there are probably fewer than half a dozen sans serif typefaces in existence. All the variation is in detail, weight and tonality.</p>

<p>But John, you might mention that Frutiger does not; nor did Linotype. Is Frutiger&rsquo;s eye to remain distrusted, is his voice to remain unheard?</p>
<p>Thomas, is your presentation related to the famous 7-page letter Fred Brady, then acting for Adobe, sent to Linotype when Linotype, acting for Frutiger, complained about Myriad?</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.letimes.com">www.letimes.com</a> &ndash; the site that celebrates type piracy &ndash; for more on Myriad and Frutiger. It&rsquo;s difficult to believe the issue is still going on.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t it been pretty well-established that Robert and Carol were asked to design a characterless sans, and that it was so bad that Robert basically had to turn it into Frutiger to get it off the ground? And isn&rsquo;t that the point where Carol lost input into the basic design?</p>
<p>Like Carol said, a few years later, when she saw Today Sans Serif and its successor, Robert&rsquo;s Cronos: not <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>By now, what&rsquo;s the point of someone else defending Robert Slimbach&rsquo;s rather dodgy sans serifs? He certainly doesn&rsquo;t dirty his own hands by attempting to do so &hellip;.</p>

<p>This is crucial in my opinion, for the US design law is restricted to “the design for an article of manufacture”.</em></p>
<p>The very first design patent granted in the US was for a typeface (an ornament type), in the mid-1800s. There are no &lsquo;special provisions&rsquo; for typefaces in US patent law because they are covered by the basic design patent law and registration regulations, as set out by the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office. A number of larger US font developers regularly obtain design patents for new types, including Adobe and Microsoft. The Microsoft CT fonts, for example, were all submitted for design patent and, so far as I know, all were granted.</p>
<p>Whether all, none or some of the design patents granted to typeface designs would stand up to contest in court is, of course, an open question. I&rsquo;m not sure whether there have been any cases in which this was an issue. Judge White&rsquo;s comments in the SSi summary judgement indicate that there are material questions regarding Adobe&rsquo;s design patents that deserve to be examined in court, rather than in a summary judgement. I don&rsquo;t take the comments to imply that he thought design patents for typefaces per se were questionable, in the way that you seem to, but that individual patents should be subject to examination in court, and not subject to summary judgement.</p>

<p>Mr. Hudson:</p>
<p>I will not insist on my legal views, since for me as a German, the US laws are not my province, but if your statements about the US patent law were true, then the court in the Adobe vs. SSi lawsuit would have been <strong>necessitated</strong> by the US patent law to <strong>grant</strong> Adobe&rsquo;s motion concerning Adobe&rsquo;s claims regarding Adobe&rsquo;s registered typeface design patents, but the court on the contrary did exactly the opposite and <strong>denied</strong> Adobe&rsquo;s motion.</p>
<p>PS: You appended a new second paragraph to your message, while I posted mine. Therefore I have to add this additional explanation. The defendant (SSi) referred to the &ldquo;article-of-manufacture&rdquo;-necessity,</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Defendants claim that the patents are invalid because the font designs are non-statutory subject matter in Violation of 35 U.S.C. section 171 (requiring &ldquo;original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture&rdquo;) in that none of the design patents disclose an article of manufacture.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>Therefore the court stated: <cite>&rdquo;&hellip;genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the validity and enforceability of the design patents&quot;.</cite></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to go all post-modern on you, Bill, and say that the author is dead. Which is not to say that Frutiger&rsquo;s opinion on the similarity between Frutiger and Myriad is irrelevant, only that I&rsquo;m not going to privilege it over any other opinion. Ultimately, as I have stated repeatedly in this thread, the determination of individuality in the designs is down to whether people are willing to spend money on both types and whether they find them independently useful.</p>
<p>Do people who own licenses for Myriad think it is pointless to spend money on Frutiger? Do people who own licenses for Frutiger think it is pointless to spend money on Myriad? Those are the questions that determine the independent value of the designs, or the lack of independent value.</p>
<p>Since Linotype sell Myriad, I wonder what their own sales data indicates in this regard.</p>

<p>It was registered as a typeface, just like dozens of other typeface designs have been registered by the USPTO for over 150 years. The typeface is the article of manufacture. Typefaces are now manufactured as computer programs; previously they were manufactured as photographic negatives, and before that as brass matrices or as pieces of metal. The material of manufacture seems to me less relevant than the process of manufacture.</p>
<p>By the way, the legislative and executive branches of the US goverment have a vested interest in confirming the applicability of design patent protection for typefaces, because it is regularly used as justification for refusing further debate the issue of copyright protection. The mantra in Washington is that design patent registration is the appropriate level of protection for typeface design, and ergo there is no need to revisit the question of copyright protection.</p>

<p>On Adsans, I said &ldquo;the only other face <em>remotely</em> like that&rdquo;. Stone Sans has varied letter widths, rather than more homogenous (grotesque) proportions, which is a significant difference in basic architecture.</p>
<p><em>the determination of individuality in the designs is down to whether people are willing to spend money on both types and whether they find them independently useful.</em></p>
<p>In that case, shouldn&rsquo;t we wait to see whether people buy and use Aeon, before condemning it?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, the &lsquo;pages of text&rsquo; argument anent Frutiger and Myriad is a good one, but it is also fatally flawed: you can&rsquo;t have pages of great-looking Myriad without having Frutiger first. Slimbach&rsquo;s brief was to design a completely independent, anonymous sans. He couldn&rsquo;t. As Carol has said, &lsquo;It didn&rsquo;t work. None of us were happy with it. As time went on, the design got more and more to look like Frutiger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Is there really anything more to say? She did <em>not</em> say to me, as far as I remember, &lsquo;that made me uncomfortable&rsquo; or &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t like that&rsquo;, but it was clear she was uncomfortable and didn&rsquo;t like it. Hence her withdrawal to the peripheries of the project.</p>
<p>If he had had any talent as a sans serif designer, he could have designed something else &ndash; something not the fairly recent work of a living designer whose work he knew intimately. He could have designed something that genuinely was original, like Scala Sans. But he didn&rsquo;t, and a few years later he turned around and did the same thing to Volker Kuster with Today Sans Serif. That&rsquo;s the way the guy works.</p>
<p>What is really the point of defending people who are stealing and who know they are stealing &ndash; and who are probably laughing at you for defending them? It&rsquo;s all too sordid!</p>
<p>The long and the short of it is that when designs are so close that this kind of passionate argument by real experts can take place, then the designs really are too close.</p>
<p>The discussion has no legal effect of course. But neither does it have any moral effect on either Adobe or Robert Slimbach. They have never cared, from the day they made the original presentation to Frutiger, to the day Thomas made his recent presentation, to be either truthful or fully disclosive as regards Myriad. I haven&rsquo;t seen the original presentation, but I remember Bruno Steinert discussing it two or three years ago, and he was still all but shaking with rage. From a corporate point of view, you can&rsquo;t realistically ask any of these people to take a different position. What would they look like if they just came out and admitted what happened in the case both of Myriad and of Cronos? But I guess that&rsquo;s the wrong question, because they can&rsquo;t look worse than they do now. Oh, for a breath of candour!</p>
<p>Uli, I must admit I like the Blake illustration; it&rsquo;s a new concept to me.</p>
<p>My last word is, stealing designs may not be illegal, but it is in very bad taste.</p>

<p>This is really an offensive post. Really, if candor is needed, it&rsquo;s not here. It is full of logical leaps, bad reporting, manipulated sources, unfounded judgement and obfuscated opinion presented as fact.</p>
<p>Has it occurred to you that perhaps everyone <em>has</em> &ldquo;admitted what happened&rdquo; with Myriad and Cronos, and it&rsquo;s just not what you want to hear? Just because everyone hasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;admitted&rdquo; what you claim to &ldquo;know&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make it a controversy.</p>
<p>It seems to me, Bill, that you are reading whatever you want into Carol&rsquo;s quotes. In another post, you quote her as replying &ldquo;Not again!&rdquo; to your asking about the similarity between Cronos and Today Sans. You state you didn&rsquo;t ask what she meant by it. In the current thread here, you&rsquo;ve presented the same quote out of context as some kind of damning judgement (seemingly with great relish), but really, doesn&rsquo;t everybody here say the same thing when the subject comes up?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another quote for you: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the beef?&rdquo;</p>

<p><cite>So if we Typophiles can get all worked up about Aeon, why do we turn a blind eye to Myriad?
Firstly, because it is published by Adobe.
Secondly, because it is by designers who have produced many completely original faces.
Thirdly, because it is so well done: there is a double standard, where we may be prepared to accept skillful derivatives, because they add to the original, but not poorly executed efforts.
Reputation counts for a lot.</cite></p>
<p>If I were to write a German book about the history of the printing industry from Gutenberg till now, I would devote a comprehensive chapter on Adobe and on Geschke and Warnock. While I fully recognize that there also have happened in recent decades many technological innovations in the printing machine industry and even in the paper making and in the book binding industry, I am fully convinced that the revolutionary developments in the pre-press sector of the printing industry are mainly due to two Adobe innovations: PostScript and PDF.</p>
<p>In this book on the history of the printing industry, if I were to write it, I would also mention that Adobe produced fonts, but I would not mention the forgery Myriad, because, from the global historial point of view, typefaces are ephemerical things, which come and go, and the making of imitations, clones, and forgeries already started during Gutenberg&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
<p>I recommend that every type designer should make a print out in large type size of this famous quote and pin it to the wall above his computer:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Most of these queer types were mania types; they were produced to satisfy a demand of novelty, and when the taste cloyed they wore away in disgrace and a later novelty took their place. What appetites our grandfathers and our great-grandfathers had! We are now busy reviving some of the things they did. &hellip; Printers and typographers to-day sometimes laugh at their predecessors who doted on these things, but they are often no better themselves. They have the same thirst for novelty, and the same facility for tiring of their pets. Typefounders' catalogues are strewn with the dead corpses of types that flourished exotically for a day and then drooped and were forgotten.&quot;</strong> (Seán Jennett, The Making of Books, Faber &amp; Faber, 5th edition 1973, page 246).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Not a very good point, since in the real, the factual, world, people often spend money on identical typefaces. Or even different versions of typefaces. A designer who really liked Minion, for example, could easily want to have all of the dozen or so permutations. And I believe National Geographic &ndash;  which makes stupendous use of the MM version &ndash; still uses custom instances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Careful, Bill, plenty of people here also know Carol and Robert and were actually present at Adobe during the development of the originals in question.&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that case Carl, why don&rsquo;t you provide some information that actually contradicts anything I&rsquo;ve reported? Having extensively discussed the piracy of both Myriad and Cronos with Slimbach, Twombley, Lemon and Stone, as well as Steinert from Lino and Pool from Scangraphic, I honestly think I have a clear picture of what happened. Do you have anything to add? If so, let&rsquo;s hear it!</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of Adobe and piracy, let me just mention, since I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s conveniently shown by Google, the elaborate research John Downer offered on the Type Design list, some years ago, showing that Adobe Trajan was a direct ripoff of drawings by &ndash; forget his name &ndash;. As I recall, Downer told the story also of how Adobe did actually admit some of this, and at some point talked of offering some sort of compensation to the designer&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>Are there still people out there who are going to insist that the Adobe type department is some kind of clean room?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On the seminal issue of Adobe Trajan and Father Catich, I have found some of the relevant posts from the Type Design list in 1999, and, apologizing for length, repost four of them here.</p>
<ol>
<li>John Downer, 21 July 1999, 21:08 EDT.</li>
</ol>
<p>The late Father Edward M. Catich (d.1979), of St. Ambrose University in
Davenport, Iowa, was generally recognized as the foremost authority on
both the style and genesis of the lettering that survives on the Trajan 
Column. Carol Twombly proceeded on Adobe Trajan, at the direction of
Sumner Stone, and used Catich&rsquo;s research &amp; reproductions extensively,
all WITHOUT permission from The Catich Memorial Gallery, which owns
the rights to the Catich material. Sumner&rsquo;s stated position was to stay
secretive about the project, and for Adobe to pay some (unstated) sum
to St. Ambrose University if the CMG administrators ever complained.</p>
<p>Complaints were definitely heard, but Adobe didn&rsquo;t pay. David is right.</p>
<p>There was indeed an effort made by Adobe to get permission to quote 
writings by Catich about the Trajan inscription, for promotional use 
in the Adobe Trajan type specimen, but Adobe&rsquo;s attempt to finally &ldquo;do 
right&rdquo; backfired. By that time, Mary Herrera, then director of the CMG
had received news of Adobe&rsquo;s &ldquo;revival&rdquo; project. Soon, St. Ambrose U.
threatened Adobe with a lawsuit over the unauthorized reproduction 
of Catich&rsquo;s alphabet art. Unfortunately, the charge had no legal merit
in any U.S. jurisdiction, and got nowhere on that front. The CMG did 
succeed in forbidding Adobe&rsquo;s use of Catich&rsquo;s copyrighted writings.</p>
<p>Please note that there is absolutely no direct use of anything Catich 
wrote about the Trajan Inscription in Rome excerpted in the Adobe 
Trajan type specimen. Not one work of his in the list of references.</p>
<p>The omission is rather telling: Adobe did only as much was required 
<em>by law</em> to compensate the Catich Memorial Gallery for Carol&rsquo;s use 
of Catich&rsquo;s artwork, research, photos, castings, and rubbings:  ZERO.</p>
<p>Regrettable it is, that Adobe behaved without honor in this instance.
I think Adobe owes St. Ambrose University at least a token payment.</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn&rsquo;t the way Adobe&rsquo;s legal staff sees the issue, but what
do they know? They are not being paid to follow their conscience(s).
If fairness were to have been the guiding principle, the story would
have been happier. As it stands, the Adobe Trajan type specimen is a
<em>farce</em> in the absence of Catich&rsquo;s original commentary and the CMG&rsquo;s 
endorsement (or &ldquo;blessing,&rdquo; as David calls it). It is utterly laughable
for Adobe to claim the Trajan inscription is a &quot; first-century example 
of &lsquo;capitalis monumentalis&rsquo; &quot; in the text of the specimen booklet. (In
the same sentence, no less, the word <em>millennium</em> is spelled wrong.)</p>

<p>Adobe wanted to mention Father Catich&rsquo;s research in the promotional
material for Trajan, which, as John points out, would have been only
natural. Adobe looked forward to giving a charitable gift to CMG - after
all, we have tremendous respect for Catich&rsquo;s research. Unfortunately the
CMG took the position that anything based on the Trajan inscription
constituted a use of that research(!), and demanded for an exorbitant sum.
They seemed to feel they owned the inscription itself, and to overlook the
substantial development and interpretation Carol contributed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The omission is rather telling: Adobe did only as much was required

<p>I&rsquo;m unclear why John thinks Carol used them.</p>

<p>I think Adobe owes St. Ambrose University at least a token payment.</p>

<p>Which is what they were offered, and they declined.</p>

<p>Indeed, since Trajan draws on the inscription, not Catich&rsquo;s research.
Certainly he deserves credit for highlighting the perfection of that
particular inscription, and it&rsquo;s frustrating that the heirs of his estate
refused to allow that credit to be given in the Trajan mateials.</p>

</ol>
<p>I am surprised and disappointed that John Downer, who&rsquo;s done his share of
typeface design, would not understand the situation with Trajan. To try to
clarify things further, I&rsquo;d like to offer three points.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Carol Twombly - not Catich or some ancient Roman carver - created the
value in the Trajan typeface.
1a) Trajan is an interpretation, not a copy. What Carol digitized were her
own drawings, not the marble or someone&rsquo;s rubbings of it. Not one of the
letterforms in Trajan is identical to a corresponding form on the Trajan
column.
1b) Trajan is a typeface, not an inscription. Not only are the two media
quite separate, their different functions require differences in design.
The forms and spacing necessary in a useful typeface are different from
those in Imperial inscriptions, and many additional characters are required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Father Catich deserves lots of credit for focusing the world&rsquo;s attention
on the Trajan column inscription, as well as for demonstrating the brush
origin of the classic Imperial letterform. This seminal work, however
important to our understanding of capital letterforms, does not make the
&ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; of the Trajan column inscription his. Catich didn&rsquo;t create
it, and was not the first or last to study it. And the broad appreciation
of the classic look which makes Trajan successful has virtually nothing to
do with Catich&rsquo;s work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Adobe approached the Catich Memorial Gallery to offer more
visibility for Catich&rsquo;s work, and a donation out of respect for that piece
of history, CMG responded belligerently. They appeared not to appreciate
the points above. They appeared to believe that the type group at Adobe had
piles of money at its disposal, and they appeared to think they had a legal
case. I get the impression CMG may have thought that letting Adobe pay
homage would somehow enhance the typeface&rsquo;s sales. Of course that&rsquo;s
foolish, but clearly CMG didn&rsquo;t understand the situation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of us in the type group were saddened and frustrated at CMG&rsquo;s attitude.
It&rsquo;s very unfortunate when institutions like CMG close the door on
opportunity, but to portray their own choice as an injustice against them
is yet another misjudgment.</p>

<p>I would be glad to respond to David Lemon&rsquo;s questions and comments.</p>
<p>I first saw Adobe Trajan when it was in development at Adobe Systems
in early 1988. Sumner Stone, who was then type director, showed me.
I also saw reproductions from Catich&rsquo;s book Reed, Pen, &amp; Brush there,
along with other reference materials, when Sumner gave me a look.</p>
<p>Carol&rsquo;s work was going forward under the direction of Sumner and the
committee he had invited to help direct type development at Adobe at
the time: Jack Stauffacher, Stephen Harvard, Lance Hidy, Gerard Unger,
Roger Black all served in some capacity as advisors and consultants.
It is ludicrous for David to suggest that Carol believes her work could
(or did) take place without Sumner&rsquo;s direction. Sumner was her boss.
He was the type director. Are we to think that Carol acted in defiance?</p>
<p>I asked Sumner how Adobe had dealt with the Catich Memorial Gallery
to obtain permission to reproduce the plates from Reed, Pen, &amp; Brush, 
presuming that Adobe was the party responsible for copying the plates.
Sumner, a member of A-Typ-I, who had been instrumental in getting
me to join A-Typ-I a couple years earlier, admitted (a bit sheepishly, 
I recall) that he had not yet contacted the CMG. He further stated that
he had no plans to do so until Adobe Trajan was finished, but said, in
passing, that if CMG hollered about it, he would arrange for Adobe to 
pay them, and that Adobe&rsquo;s money should shut them up. That&rsquo;s about as 
far as my conversation with Sumner ever got. End of discussion.</p>
<p>My gripe then, as it is now, pertains specifically to the ORDER in which
things were done. The only fair &amp; decent approach, to my way of thinking,
is to ask permission FIRST. David completely skirts this when telling his
version of the story. The CMG was <em>naturally</em> outraged when Adobe told
them how much they would be paid for their consent before any consent
was ever politely or reasonably requested. Adobe had not bothered with
this detail prior to the time they were ready to produce the specimen 
booklet showing the finished Adobe Trajan typeface, fait accompli.</p>
<p>How would you feel if a &ldquo;friend&rdquo; approached you one day to pay you three
bucks and to say thanks? Thanks for what? Oh, for the use of your wife&rsquo;s
car &hellip; it had a full tank of gas when we took it (before asking, of course).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heck, why are you getting mad?  We didn&rsquo;t crash the car.  Be cool, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me, there are ethical and philosophical matters to be examined here:
Why bother asking if you fear the answer will be no? Well, there&rsquo;s a very
simple principle in the realm of civil behavior called COURTESY. It hinges 
on the practice of the borrower showing respect for the lender. Adobe had
shown absolutely no respect for the rights of the CMG before announcing
its token offering (a sum considerably less than CMG figured would have
been fair and appropriate). This is why I have sided with CMG on this issue,
as nearly any Iowan, or other person with true respect for Catich, would.</p>
<p>It all boils down to following the kind of procedure the P-22 foundry has
adopted. They work out an agreement with a gallery or foundation BEFORE
they digitize the handwriting of a famous artist or personality, so that
there are no hard feelings on the part of the owner, or in some cases the
would-be owner, when the fonts appear. Again, it has to do with manners, 
propriety, and honor. It is not merely a matter of interpreting a statute.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s true what David says about Carol not remembering that Adobe 
Trajan was designed at Adobe Systems, under the direction of Sumner
Stone, with the aid of various Catich materials, then <em>somebody</em> has a
selective memory. I sure hope the forgetful person ain&rsquo;t me.</p>

<p>Nop, because Aeon doesn&rsquo;t display any significantly distinctive features at all and has an identical tonality, to use your word, to Infinity. It is not another typeface in the same genre to Infinity, it is a blatant copy of Infinity.

<p>Bill Troop, you have quite a lot of insight into the development of Myriad; were you an employee of Adobe at the time? Which foundry do you presently work for?</p>
<p>Many thanks to Uli for the great quote about novelty; I would say that this should be known by all designers! There is so much style-instead-of-substance in the worlds of design, art, film, television, music, etc. It&rsquo;s much more interesting to behold a creative failure than a successful pastiche.</p>
<p>Thanks to SuperUltraFabulous for posting Lucida Fax and Cambria; those two typefaces are clearly very different from each other. This is another good example of how subtlety is the province of the type designer. The roman alphabet is the given, and creating new ways to express the alphabet is the challenge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like classical music performance: Bach wrote the music down to be played a certain way with the right tempi, dynamics, etc. Yet there are countless ways in which the music can be interpreted. Just look at the number of recordings of the Goldberg Variations, and you can see what I mean. (Many performers have recorded the work twice or more, including Glenn Gould and Andras Schiff.)</p>
<p>While that Infinity typeface is not my cup of tea, it&rsquo;s not like anything else I&rsquo;ve seen. In a way, it&rsquo;s like a song by Beck. And Aeon is clearly a &ldquo;cover version&rdquo;, which probably should have stayed in the basement.</p>
<p>Ha! Bach and Beck!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>But John, this doesn&rsquo;t address the fact that Myriad could never have been designed if Robert hadn&rsquo;t had Frutiger to trace over. The issue is, is it OK to trace over someone else&rsquo;s font and then claim that it is original? There wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if Adobe hadn&rsquo;t wasted so much bandwidth trying to claim that they hadn&rsquo;t done this.</p>
<p>By contrast, look how Font Bureau works. FB has lots of of copies or adaptations of pre-existing work. Each one is impeccably sourced and credited. If Font Bureau had done Myriad, it would have said &lsquo;closely based on the seminal design Frutiger&rsquo; or something like that. And there wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue here today. FB spends a lot of time trying to persuade users that its fonts look like something &ndash; and that&rsquo;s true. Adobe spends a lot of time trying to persuade users that their fonts don&rsquo;t look like something &ndash; and that&rsquo;s not true. In other words, it&rsquo;s not so much Adobe&rsquo;s practice that is vile &ndash; though it is &ndash; as their lying about it.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that kinda sorta tell you that you&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree when you focus on the issue of the slightly different character of two nearly identical typefaces? That isn&rsquo;t the issue, fella! I know it&rsquo;s painful, but &ndash; but when are you going to face up to the real issues of right and wrong here? There really isn&rsquo;t a third way. Heaven alone knows you&rsquo;ve been through enough to know that!</p>

<p>John I have to disagree here. Myriad is part and parcel of just about every Adobe application {perhaps an exaggeration- Mr. Phinney knows for sure}. Its certainly apart of the Creative Suite- the standard for graphic designers. If Myriad is included in the app you use everyday at no additional charge then why would you buy Frutiger? Minus client stipulations of course.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mike: <em>If Myriad is included in the app you use everyday at no additional charge then why would you buy Frutiger?</em></p>
<p>I think you are making my point for me, because people <em>do</em> buy Frutiger, despite the widespread availability of Myriad, and I think this is precisely because the faces are different enough to be independently valuable and useful for distinct purposes.</p>
<p>Myriad certainly put competetive pressure on Frutiger because it is in the same narrow genre. And what was the result? Frutiger Next, with its extended range of weights and its true italic. That&rsquo;s what competition is supposed to do: drive improvements and increase the options available to buyers.</p>
<p>If a typeface is a straight rip-off with no independent value, it is unfair competition, which is what one wants intellectual property laws to protect against. But it is an abuse of such laws to stifle legitimate competition. To my mind, legitimacy has to reside in independent value that makes two competing products desirable on their own merits.</p>
<p>It is my <em>opinion,</em> based on having worked with Myriad MM, Myriad Pro, Frutiger Linotype, and Frutiger Next, that Myriad meets this criterion of independent value. And by possessing its own value it doesn&rsquo;t diminish the value of Frutiger, which it would if it were just a copy with no independent value. Again, that&rsquo;s my opinion: the conclusion I have come to on these particular fonts. I came to a different conclusion about Segoe UI, which I don&rsquo;t think is sufficiently different from Frutiger to have independent <em>design</em> value (it has independent technical value in its character set coverage and hinting, but we&rsquo;re talking about design here). In neither case is my conclusion influenced by knowledge, gossip or supposition about the process by which these types came to be made. I actually don&rsquo;t much care whether Myriad was copied from Frutiger or Segoe was miraculously arrived at without reference to Frutiger. Why not? <strong>Because it doesn&rsquo;t change what I&rsquo;m looking at.</strong></p>
<p>One of the benefits of this approach to the issue, i.e. concentrating on the value of the thing made rather than the question of how it was made, is that one doesn&rsquo;t have to wade through the swamp with a divining rod, listening to the competing chatter of the inhabitants and trying to determine the truth of who said what, and who did what to whom, and who kissed whom behind the gym at recess. In other words, you can look at two typefaces, work with them, and make up your own adult mind about whether they have independent value and ignore the previous 150 messages in this thread.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that upsetting old story should be told or retold in this thread; let me know an email address and I&rsquo;ll send you a note.</p>
<p>I am more interested in John&rsquo;s honing of his position. I still don&rsquo;t think he is right, but he has gotten around to stating it in a way such that I think we all should be seriously thinking about it and I for one intend to think about what he is saying for a day or two before replying.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><strong>!!! Who can spot the Myriad letter wins the book prize !!!</strong></p>
<p>I have already read too many hazy terms in this thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Myriad’s architecture&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Myriad&rsquo;s tonality&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>and similar hazy, undefinable notions.</p>
<p>The real test is whether you can spot Myriad letters.</p>
<p>I guess that those who assert that Myriad is <strong>not</strong> a clone, <strong>not</strong> a rip off, <strong>not</strong> a forgery etc., will not be able to spot most letters of the Myriad alphabet, if these Myriad letters are mixed with letters of other fonts.</p>
<p>I have uploaded one letter test file, here for the letter &ldquo;o&rdquo;, at my site</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/myriad_o.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/myriad_o.pdf</a></p>
<p>In order to make the experiment more attractive, I offer this prize:</p>
<p>Whosoever is the first to quote the correct number of the &ldquo;o&rdquo; of the Myriad in this Typophile thread, wins a precious original booklet dealing with the Syntax-Antiqua, which belongs to those famous sanserif fonts designed by German-speaking designers (Akzidenz-Grotesk, Helvetica, Frutiger, Syntax, etc. etc.) which have been imitated and cloned and forged so often by others.</p>
<p>This valuable 24-page Syntax-Antiqua booklet with a cardboard cover has portrait format (69 picas height by 40 picas width) and is typeset in 7p, 10p, and 14p Syntax-Antiqua foundry type and is printed by letterpress and contains numerous black-and-white illustrations and one color illustration and is not a promotional booklet, but a scholarly documentation in German language comparing Syntax-Antiqua with numerous other typefaces. The booklet is entitled:</p>
<p>Erich Schulz-Anker
Formanalyse und Dokumentation einer serifenlosen Linearschrift auf neuer Basis: Syntax-Antiqua. Frankfurt am Main 1969</p>
<p>In his dissertation, page 39-40, Keith Tom made quotations from this booklet, see here:</p>
<p><a href="http://typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_16.pdf">http://typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_16.pdf</a></p>
<p>So, again, whosoever spots the Myriad-&ldquo;o&rdquo; in the file myriad_o.pdf and who is the first to quote the correct letter number (printed to the right of the letter &ldquo;o&rdquo; in the file) will be sent the original Syntax-Antiqua booklet as a book prize.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take care not to select Frutiger. This would be a give-away :-(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;tonality&rdquo;, provided this helps :-)</p>
</li>
</ul>

My own organization, if you can call it that, Adagio Type Foundry aka Addict Type Foundry released some fonts in the mid 1990s through Precision Type but they are difficult to find at the moment. There is an Australian retailer which doesn&rsquo;t pay royalties that sells them, and there is a UK retailer that does pay royalties that sells them &ndash; I forget the name of both.</p>
<p>Without really coming to grips yet with John&rsquo;s position, I reluctantly can&rsquo;t agree with it. Is it, simply expressed, this?</p>
<p>&lsquo;That if a clone has value independent of its model, it is ethically clean&rsquo; ?</p>
<p>I would, in the meantime, like to raise a red herring, which is that I disagree with the statement that the original Frutiger did not have a &lsquo;true italic&rsquo;. This is simply too value-laden. Of course it had a true italic, and it isn&rsquo;t a mere mechanical slant (and even if it were, am I the only person to remember the graphical Berthold ad which memorably showed the difference between the Postscript mechanical slant we are all familiar with, and the rather more artful slant that Ikarus is capable of?). Frutiger Next and Myriad both have (somewhat) cursive italics, and cursive is the term I wish John had used. I don&rsquo;t think the cursive italic for Frutiger is &lsquo;true&rsquo;; for one thing, it wasn&rsquo;t designed by Frutiger. I detest these politically correct cursive italics, or rather the unthinking dictum that there shall and must be cursive italics, rather like Lenin&rsquo;s famous promise &lsquo;After the Revolution you shall have strawberries and cream.&rsquo; No &lsquo;you may&rsquo; there, or &lsquo;you will be able&rsquo;. You shall have them, whether you like strawberries and cream or not.</p>

your argument is ridiculous. If someone wants a replacement for Infinity which has less character, why would he choose a typeface which is 99% identical? Surely he would look at typefaces like Flama, or Klavika, or DIN.</p>

Infinity is a modular-based display face. There is so much space and possibilities in  display typeface (and even in modular faces) that it is obvious that Aeon is just a plagiat. It is just a plagiat made by some unimaginative designer.

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>It’s number 329 plain as day, on page 19, third column sixth from the top.</cite></p>
<p>Mr. Levien:</p>
<p>My congratulations. You have hit the nail on the head. Please let me have your postal address (with zip-code, town and street) so that I may send you the Syntax booklet by airmail.</p>
<p>But please do not say that it was &ldquo;plain as day&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I know that you are a GScript expert and a programmer. For you, it was easy to extract the PS source from the PDF.</p>
<p>/FontName /RPZTQP+Myriad-Roman def
&hellip;
[/N3785/RPZTQP+Myriad-Roman 1 TZ
&hellip;
/N3785 1 Tf (o)Tj
&hellip;
/N3887 1 Tf (3)Tj
/N3887 1 Tf (29 )Tj</p>
<p>and voilà, it was &ldquo;plain as day&rdquo; to you that Myriad had number 329.</p>
<p>The other possible approach for you would have been to enlarge the letters in the PDF to huge point sizes in Acrobat and to study these blown-up letters. But this is not permitted here. The German regulatory specifications to the design law prescribe that the alphabet submitted to the design office must be typeset in 16 points and must not be examined with a magnifying tool (microscope etc.). In other words: Tiny details in letterforms, which are only visible in huge point sizes, are ignored, if two typefaces are compared. The law had to define a specific point size for objective comparisons of different typefaces, and it should be remembered that the vast majority of all texts are typeset in point sizes much smaller than 16 point.</p>
<p>Therefore, as regards the file myriad_o.pdf, the sample would look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/myriad_o.gif">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/myriad_o.gif</a></p>
<p>Here nobody sees that 329 is Myriad. Here nothing is &ldquo;plain as day&rdquo;.</p>
<p>All typeface samples reproduced in this thread are much to large for legally relevant comparisons. Since the differences between Frutiger and Myriad are not visible in small point sizes, ridiculously huge samples were displayed above in this thread.</p>
<p>In the good old days, typefaces could be compared with the naked eye even in ordinary point sizes. In our modern Bezier-node-twiddling era, you need a magnifying glass to see what is &ldquo;new&rdquo; in so-called &ldquo;new and original&rdquo; typefaces.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s comments lead credence to Aeon? That&rsquo;s not the impression I got from this thread, but I am not masochistic enough to reread it.</p>
<p>Trying to examine the strength of my position that what is important about a typeface is not just what it is but what it was, take the following case. Someone in the early 90s has the idea that &lsquo;Frutiger Battered&rsquo; would be a great font. The designer takes the Frutiger data, batters it about a bit either by hand or by program, and places the resulting thing on the market. We now have a functional object which is completely different from Frutiger. So what are the ethics there? The ethical problem occurs not in the final result, but in all the processes &ndash; thefts &ndash; that led up to it. Frutiger has been robbed, all the technicians who worked on the font have been robbed, the foundry has been robbed.</p>
<p>Or take another case. I think Minion is just a tad too narrow. Suppose I take a copy and widen it by five or ten percent. Suppose I do this really carefully, not mechanically with the scaling control, but paying some real attention to the process and the results. Maybe I make a few improvements along the way &ndash; that dreadful question mark for instance, and the too tight fitting, and maybe I fix some of the mistakes in the italic, even.  Etc. etc. I now have a complete theft but it is not at all a substitute for Minion, though it might be a useful companion.</p>
<p>All of these devices are plausible, and they are getting us away from the idea that the final utility of the product is the valid arbiter of the issue, no?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even saying that I don&rsquo;t agree with John fundamentally, maybe I do, I haven&rsquo;t really thought it through. All I&rsquo;m saying is that it&rsquo;s not too difficult to poke some serious holes in his position, which will also be holes in my position if I adopt his.</p>

<p>Earlier in this discussion you were explaining how the legal question rests on the response of an informed user to a page of text, which is very sensible, now you are making tests based on identifying single letters mixed with other fonts, which is very silly. This has nothing to do with typography.</p>
<p>For the record, I&rsquo;ve said everything I want to say on this subject, and I&rsquo;m going to stop following this thread now. Anyone who wants to go and work with Myriad and Frutiger can make up their own mind about whether they have independent value. I certainly don&rsquo;t expect everyone to agree with my conclusion, but I do think the basis on which I made that conclusion is a sound one. If someone tells me that he or she has worked with both typefaces and finds them interchangeable, with no independent value, I might question that person&rsquo;s perceptive skills and typographic sensibilities, but at least it will be a conclusion arrived at from the types themselves and not from gossip. Goodbye.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Unfortunately, Mr. Hudson, in my opinion, makes a logical error here (at least as far as the German design law is concerned).</p>
<p>By the German design law, you have to supply for a new typeface the alphabet in lowercase (a&hellip;z) and uppercase (A&hellip;Z) and the figures (0&hellip;9) and 5 lines of arbitrary text, all this typeset exactly in 16 points. The file</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/frutiger-myriad.gif">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/frutiger-myriad.gif</a></p>
<p>shows exactly, what you would have to supply to the design office in case of the regular styles of Frutiger and Myriad. I intentionally did not upload a PDF file, but only a gif file, so that nobody can enlarge the sample to huge point sizes.</p>
<p>Two things become apparent by viewing the sample: Firstly, most of the tiny distinctions between both fonts vanish, because they are no longer visible in 16 point size. Secondly, the five lines of text ignore &ldquo;typographical sensibilities&rdquo;, because the typeface, for whose design you request the registration, is not a text, but a collection of single letters. You do not apply at the design office for the protection of the design of a certain text, e.g. for the layout of a certain book, but you only apply for the protection of the design of the letters A-Z etc. constituting a specific typeface. Hence Mr. Hudson&rsquo;s view is a hysteron-proteron. The design of the typeface comes first (proteron), the design of typographical products (books, magazines, etc.) using this typeface come second (hysteron).</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson is correct in assuming that I never worked with Myriad. Indeed, I never used Myriad nor any of the other forgeries documented at my website for legal authorities. Why should I want to use forgeries?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, a fake Chippendale chair can still be awfully nice to sit in, and a good copy of a Goya can be rewarding to look at (see the endless passages Galsworthy devotes to just that issue). I think a mistake both John and Uli make is to consider font usage only from their unique personal perspectives. One has to consider whole blocs of other users as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think it is a mistake to focus exclusively on the technical elements of font forgery, to use Uli&rsquo;s loaded term. The ethical and historical aspects should also be considered. What is the matter with looking at the whole picture?</p>
<p>At any rate, it is nice, and just, that the Segoe design patent was invalidated. The design patents for Myriad and Cronos should similarly be invalidated except that there is no compelling financial reason to do. Not even Adobe has the effrontery to claim either typeface has the kind of originality a design patent would, ideally, embody. Their motives for seeking this protection were far more cynical: they could get away with it. When I was working on my 18th century transitional for Adobe, I was told never to describe it as such, but as a completely original design, because that way I could get a design patent. &lsquo;Nobody at the patent office will know the difference,&rsquo; as Carol told me.</p>
<p>I went along with that. This kind of opportunistic thinking is very corrupting, not that that is any excuse. What a sordid web! You can never get a little entangled. You&rsquo;re always a lot entangled. Just like you can&rsquo;t be a little pregnant.</p>

<p>John&rsquo;s English Department point was awfully on-target. The lowest level of hell on earth may be the college English department. However, below that I imagine is the poetry world, and below that the font world. Yet we keep on going!</p>

I have read the most of it, and I wish to congratulate witj John Hudson and Karsten Lücke, which took their time (especially John) to articolate their reflections in such a substantial way. They are perfectly balanced. Bravo!</p>
<p>All I wish to add are two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Infinity is more a &ldquo;conceptual&rdquo; typeface (relying mostly on &ldquo;geometric&rdquo; treatment of forms, &ldquo;mechanized&rdquo; monotonal treatment, uneven endings et al), while Frutiger is the fruit of a long synthesis over letterforms. As different as they are, a thing like Aeon is unacceptable, because it clearly builds almost entirely on the work done to create Infinity.
A face like Myriad, despite all the references to Frutiger, shows a process of work over all the preceeding forms. Many elements are extraneous to the fruit of Frutiger&rsquo;s own work on letters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately, I have only one criteria to decide in these situations: Was an alphabet produced out of the desire of doing something meaningful and – as Karsten said – expressing the designer&rsquo;s mind?
If any reference or borrowing has been done with the desire of doing something new, the effort is enough visible, and the time spent – which makes the work an effort with merits on his own – always shows through clearly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nick, I always admire your sharp approach and intelligence of things, but this time I cannot agree: Myriad is Myriad, Frutiger is Frutiger.
As long as I don&rsquo;t find an explanation on these issues done by Frutiger himself, there are no substantial elements to consider Myriad a &ldquo;byproduct&rdquo; done by mere copying…</p>
