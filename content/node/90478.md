body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI have such a problem - I want firm typeface that would look good
  with a logotype that consist serif typeface (Adobe Jenson Pro). I want that alternative
  font to be sans-serif for showing that company is reliable and has long lasting
  experience but also is modern.\r\nI don't want that modern typeface to have similar
  contrast and rhythm. For example if I'm trying to use Myriad Pro Semi Condensed
  it looks like I'm trying imitate Adobe Jenson Pro in a \"modern way\" and its cheaply
  straightforward. \r\n\r\nSo are there any methods for finding a pair?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    and suggestions. Maybe it doesn\u2019t link to all the threads about typeface
    pairing we had on Typophile, but surely it remains a good resource.\r\nThat said,
    it\u2019s a wiki page, so anyone with enough goodwill can update it."
