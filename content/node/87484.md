  a dearth of literature and online articles concerning design spawned by this very
  painterly movement. Bringhurst is mum on the subject other than to say that the
  style \"raised waves in the typographic world\". I've been amassing historic posters
  for shows by relevant artists (C\xE9zanne, Gauguin, Matisse, early Picasso, etc.)
  to see what typographers were doing at the time but it would be great to read a
  retrospective analysis of how these typefaces and designs relate to their concurrent
  artistic movement.\r\n\r\nHas anyone read anything like this?"

    which appears on the poster art by artists like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and
    Th\xE9ophile-Alexandre Steinlen (and maybe some other Art Nouveau folks like Alphonse
    Mucha). These were color lithographs, and thus not made with type, strictly speaking.
    So you may find some people referring to Post-Impressionist type with these posters
    in mind, but people who know what they are talking about (like Bringhurst) know
    that this is lettering, not typography."

    I like to study the type, lettering, and penmanship of a period together as they
    often inform one another. I'd really like to learn how the principles of Post
    Impressionism, balancing natural perception with its expressive or investigative
    distortion, shaped letters cut, drawn, and written.

    me Post-Impressionist might mean things like Menhart's work, which I call \"fauve
    type\", a style that was revived in South America just over a decade ago.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
