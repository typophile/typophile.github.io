body: Wanted to get your opinions on this.  The final answer will of course be solicited
  from the actual font designers. <BR> <BR>I own a company that licenses fonts for
  the purpose of making alphabet stamps from them.  I contact the designers of each
  font, and pay them to license the font for that specific use, and do not retain
  any ability to redistribute the font electronically. <BR> <BR>One of my customers
  recently contacted me and asked me the legality of using the stamps &#40;created
  from the licensed fonts&#41; in a commercial venture &#40;making handmade greeting
  cards&#41;.  Would this be considered an extension of our license since it uses
  the product that we specifically licensed for? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Tim

  body: That depends on the design of the greeting card, and the exact nature of the
    licensing agreements. <BR> <BR>Tiffany Wardle and the guys from P22 know more
    about these sorts of licensing questions than anyone I know. Maybe they&#39;ll
    chime in.

  body: Hi Tim, <BR> <BR>We do license our fonts specifically for the creation and
    use with of rubber stamps and die cut alphabet systems &#40;Mostly for Scrapbooking
    Comanies&#41; and as you are aware this is usually a more significant license
    due to the reproduction ability of the medium. <BR> <BR>Should a customer of yours
    decide that they want to start a greeting card company using a rubber stamp alphabet,
    I personally would have no problem with them using the rubber stamps commercially.
    <BR> <BR>Think of it, if they buy the rubber stamps and decide to hunch over an
    ink pad and jam out a pile of greeting cards, it&#39;s no different than if they
    decided to set the font in Word and print 1,000 of &#39;em from their ink-jet
    printer. <BR> <BR>As the designer what I&#39;m most interested in protecting is
    the &#39;manner of reproduction&#39; not so much the usage thereafter. If due
    dilligence is taken care with the licensing with the maunfacturer and distributors,
    then it&#39;s essentially a side effect of reselling this type of product. <BR>

  body: Tim, <BR> <BR>A silly question, but are the rubber stamps sold or licensed
    to the end-users? I assume they are sold, with no restrictions on usage. Otherwise
    you

  body: I&#39;m with Stuart on this one. The rubber stamps are essentially the font
    in another format. The licensing of the design is appropriate for rubber stamp
    makers. The end user uses the stamps to spell out words on a commercial product...fine,
    they are using the tool &#40;the font design&#41; to make something else. If someone
    bought a die cutting system with a specific font design to then make an alppahbet
    set of rubber stamps from, then there would be an issue about a derivative commercial
    product. But &#34;printed goods&#34; should not really be considered derivative
    products &#40;in most cases&#41;.
