  OFL\r\n\r\n\"Manly? Yes, but androids like it too.\"\r\n\r\nA descenderless, anti-kern
  stencil font that you could actually make stencils from. Still best with a razor,
  not quite scissor friendly. A license you could make most anything from. Inspired
  by 'mechs, intended for streetart/craft/physical use.\r\n\r\nOpenType (TT-flavor),
  hinted, approx 190 glyphs. Includes fi, fl, Et, .~ and +/- ligs. Component of upcoming
  !CRASS ROOTS Display Family, and the new Signature font of !Exclamachine Type Foundry.\r\n\r\nI
  particularly like how the brackets and the f* ligs came out.\r\n\r\nAvailable here
  or here:\r\nhttp://www.abstractfonts.com/font/12093\r\n\r\nhttp://openfontlibrary.org/?ccm=/media/files/ChozCunningham/30"

      have 6 other versions x 3(=?) weights already, and another 18 alternate cuttings
      planned. Additionally, small caps, alternate characters, superiors and more
      ligs are almost done. This is just the free sample to ge the world hooked on
      my crack.\r\n\r\nActually I really like the stencil-ligs a lot. I think they
      came out quite well.\r\n\r\nIf you keep throwing that snark around, I'm going
      feature your picture  on the Snark supporters roster page.~"

    body: "Thank you very much Dan, that makes my day. My main goal was to make a
      design that would look consistent, yet physically hold up as a carboard or other
      cutout. Without making a dot-matrixy-thing. This required an approach that I
      suppose borders on the mysterious notanic arts that pop up here now and again.
      Actually, I just cut out the most fragile looking ones, then toyed with them.
      Some broke, and were redrawn. \r\n\r\nI've got your feed in my bookmarks now.
      I've been a fan/user of your blackletter resources page for a while but hadn't
      noticed who's tools I was perusing. Thanks for the head up, theres lots of other
      stuff there for me to go chew on!\r\n\r\nI like your letters a lot. I am fond
      of real stencil art and miss all the great graffiti from my hometown. Good stencil
      letters evoke such gravity, and pull the background up to the plane of the letters
      themselves. The DURCH BLICK feels both fast-moving and yet dense. Looking forward
      to seeing more.\r\n\r\nJust for fun, I'm going to mimic that with my face to
      see how vastly different it comes out, even though I might categorize both in
      the \"industrial\" subtype:\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/crassblick_5855.jpg]\r\n\r\n(Faux-bliqued
      on-the-fly.) My data per pixel wins! :) But it doesn't look as inarguable. :("
