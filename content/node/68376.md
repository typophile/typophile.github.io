  body: "The contrast is most like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/serpentine/|Serpentine]],
    but the G is quite different and the serifs on your sample are smaller. The only
    other approximately similar style was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/agenda/|URW
    Agenda]], but the contrast is less and the serifs are still too big. Almost anything
    else I saw that may have had similar serifs was much more monotone in stroke weight
    (like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bluejack/|URW Bluejack]]).\r\n\r\nIf
    I were trying to reproduce this, I think I would try to customize the heavy weight
    of Agenda by playing with outlines to change the contrast.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    but it's very different indeed."
