body: I just got hold of the graphic guidelines for a Finnish company, and it states
  there that only Meta+ should be used. What could that be, is it an old name? Looks
  very much like ordinary Meta to me. Are Meta and Meta Pro the same design wise?
  Is Meta+ normal the same as Meta Pro Book? I'm trying to get the cheapest and most
  effective way out of here...

    specialised Caps font they like - I know the PlusCaps have some really nice bullets
    and arrows."

  body: "Hi mili.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/meta-morphosis-how-ff-metaplus-became-ff-meta/\">FF
    MetaPlus was renamed FF Meta</a> several years ago.\r\n\r\nFF Meta comes in three
    flavors: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF+Meta+-Pro+-OT\">FF Meta</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Meta%20OT\">FF Meta OT</a>, and
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Meta%20Pro\">FF Meta Pro</a>.
    The OpenType version is cross-platform compatible and includes OT niceties like
    small caps and figures styles built in to one font. The Pro version adds more
    language support. All use the same lettershapes, the OT and Pro just add extras.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Meta%20Normal\">FF Meta Normal</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Meta%20Book\">FF Meta Book</a>
    are two different weights (Book is heavier) available in any of the three flavors."

  body: "Thank you very much, all! I suspected there was no such thing anymore, but
    good to have it confirmed. Just surprised that a large company would have such
    outdated graphic guidelines (just checked the pdf, it's from 2002).\r\n\r\nMiss
    Tiffany, interesting link, thanks!\r\nStephen, thank you for a detailed help.
    Now I \"only\" have to decide on the flavor."
