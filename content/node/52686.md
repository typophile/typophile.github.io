  body: "You mean, you exported the ID document to PDF and then exported <em>that</em>
    to Word? Try exporting to RTF (Word, in later versions) directly from the Export
    menu. You can only export text, so be sure to click first into the story you want.\r\n\r\n<cite>Or
    is there a way to import a PDF into InDesign?</cite>\r\n\r\nRather than 'just
    placing', you could buy [[http://www.recosoft.com/products/pdf2id/index.htm|PDF2ID]].
    I've read mixed reports about it; it seems you get at least <em>something</em>
    editable.\r\n\r\nWhy these two different work flows, in two opposing directions?
    What are you hoping to achieve? There might be reasonable alternatives."
