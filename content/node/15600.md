    body: "assuming chester's phonetics are correct, you should know that the accent
      marks for the first two words mean that they should be pronounced: \r\nEn-scuh-DAY\r\nand\r\nTree-nee-TAY
      \r\n\r\nI believe that the third word should be \r\n\r\nBen-GAHT\r\n\r\n\r\ngood
      luck. \r\ntraci "

  body: No, I think you're confusing accents with stress marks in English dictionaries.
    If it's pronounced the French way, each syllable would get the same amount of
    stress. I believe Chester has it right.

  body: Really well-animated, though. I love that kind of simple drawing paired with
    skilled animation--sense of weight, momentum and inertia, timing, overlapping
    action, etc.

  body: No, seriously. For every two typography books I own, I have another on animation.
    It's really more of an arm chair interest, though I have been interested in it
    even longer than I have been interested in typography.
