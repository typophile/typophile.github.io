body: 'Hello everyone.  Just wanted to take a quick survey of sorts: <BR> <BR>1&#41;  How
  many of you design your type from scratch in Illustrator &#40;no scanned images,
  just pure composition inside the program&#41;? <BR> <BR>2&#41;  How many of you
  draft the glyphs first by hand, then edit that draft in Illustrator? <BR> <BR>3&#41;  Do
  any of you use Illustrator &#40;or any comparable program&#41; simply to get the
  image in EPS format so you can do the majority of aesthetic work in FontLab? <BR>
  <BR>It seems like more of #3 should be happening than what I suspect actually is--and
  it&#39;s a wonder, because FontLab has some really great glyph-construction tools
  &#40;I don&#39;t mean to sound like I work for FontLab, no offense to those who
  do&#41;. <BR> <BR>Oh, and why do you feel that your method is best?'

  body: I almost ALWAYS start from a source either a sketch or photo of letters scanned,
    or a doodle with an idea on it I want to capture. Often times I only make one
    word to start usually less than 8 letters long. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s like a piece
    of dirt in an oyster that starts a pearl. I rely on my first tracing/drawing to
    capture the gesture of the face and if it looks right on screen then I give myself
    the green light to proceed with more of the characters and flesh out the entire
    font in Illustrator 8.0. <BR> <BR>Honestly the making of the font goes MUCH faster
    if it&#39;s drawn well first and I find Illustrator to be that tool for me. I
    reply on the peices and parts of other letters for consistent rules on how to
    make the rest of the glyphs in the face so I need the entire font in front of
    me at all times on the pasteboard. <BR> <BR>Beyond that, it&#39;s a quick import
    to FOG and a few hours to complete the font. I use FOG/FLAB strictly as technical
    font development and production tools and nothing more. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    digitise the outline in the background. Very clever, and much more efficient than

    work directly in FontLab to do the real drawing, without scans. <BR> <BR>But then
    again, I don&#39;t spend nearly as high a percentage of my time drawing letters

    question it has a lot to do with the way I draw an alphabet. A small word is first
    drawn, then I make as many obvious spin-off letters from what I have, then I refer
    to all the letters I&#39;ve created to make the remaining glyphs to flesh out
    the font set. <BR> <BR>At all times I find I need to be able to see every letter
    I&#39;ve drawn to see what parts and peices I need to steal from it to make another
    glyph from it. Illustrator uses a large pasteboard area which makes this easy
    for me to do. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t see drawing an entire font in FLAB all in one
    glyph slot and then moving each glyph into its own slot. <BR> <BR>Another part
    of it is that I&#39;m quite fast with Illustrator since I&#39;ve been working
    with it since version 3.0 as a young design pup, so I&#39;m not inclined to move
    away from that especially when you consider that it still requires the same effort
    to draw a glyph outline in either program. <BR> <BR>Now regarding my other comment
    regardint font production, I port all my drawn glyphs into FOG then do the spacing,
    kerning and hinting and generate the font. Then I import it into FLAB and correct
    the Font Info double check the hinting and export the PS versions. I save an alternate
    copy, change the em to 2048, apply the TT specific features and generate that
    version. Like I said all production since there is no further creative decisions
    required at that point in the fonts development. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D <BR> <BR>PS:
    Yep, a couple of hours it all it takes to space and kern a font. It always comes
    back to well drawn character sets.'

    their FontLab for &#34;translation&#34; purposes.  However, I now understand that
    it&#39;s a preference and that a bunch of people learned Illustrator from the
    get-go and I agree that to change your procedure after a certain point is pointless.
    <BR> <BR>For me, it&#39;s about hand-drafting &#40;an old habit from my architectural

    on the software scene. Never bothered to port over to Illustrator &#40;that double
    arrow thing always confused me for some silly reason&#41;. So drawing directly
    in FOG [same folks who made FreeHand; similar interface back then] has always
    been my preference, rather than starting somewhere else.  <BR> <BR>I work my ideas
    out on paper. At least to get started. I used to draw just about every glyph first,
    but now mostly just the key characters to get the foundation firmly established.
    Or especially tricky characters where the vectors just seem too unruly. <BR> <BR>I
    do my working drawings in HB mechanical pencil on Clearprint. I rule out &#34;slug&#34;
    lines at 250 points &#40;i.e., 1:4 ratio to the 1000 PS em square&#41; and a baseline
    and x-height. I love drawing and fine-tuning letters on paper. <BR> <BR>Then I
    scan my characters and paste them into the template in FOG and digitize directly
    there.  <BR> <BR>Lately I&#39;m getting more comfortable working directly in FOG
    without bothering to scan the sketches -- much like John described : sort of like
    a punchcutter interpreting a drawn model. <BR> <BR>I know I should switch to FLab,
    but Fog is now second nature and so I&#39;m just lazy. I&#39;d rather focus on
    the ideas and not struggle with the tool. Same problem I have with switching to
    Indy from Quark. Intellectually, I know it&#39;s better and more efficient; but
    in the short term it&#39;s just plain frustrating and too much bother. &#40;Hey,
    Carter still uses Fog 3.1, right? Good enough for him, good enough for me. Well,
    sounds like a good excuse anyway.&#41; <BR> <BR>While I understand why Stuart
    and others like him work the way they do, that seems more appropriate for display
    designs. &#40;No disrespect, Stuart.&#41; <BR> <BR>Since my chosen arena is text
    typefaces, I can&#39;t imagine not designing in an environment where spacing is

    &#40;Hard to say exactly, because it was mostly evenings and weekends.&#41; I&#39;d
    like to think that I&#39;m getting faster and better, but I still think spacing
    takes as much, if not more, time than actual character design. <BR> <BR>My ideas
    generally come from &#34;What If&#34; scenarios. Sort of like Einstein&#39;s famous
    thought experiments. Whitman grew out of something like &#34;What if Dwiggins
    had designed Joanna instead of Gill?&#34; Stadler &#40;in development&#41; is
    an experiment in &#34;What if Mozart were a punchcutter &#40;instead of a composer&#41;
    and Anton Stadler were a printer &#40;instead of a clarinetist&#41;, and Mozart
    created a typeface for him, instead of the Clarinet Concerto?&#34; I usually have
    a verbal, conceptual brief for the design even before I have a clear visual image.
    There is a felt sense of something possible or some road not taken, long before
    I discover what it actually looks like. <BR> <BR>There are always references to
    other sources, historic and contemporary. These usually have a love/hate component
    and a certain amount of hubris -- &#34;This has some nice aspects, but I would
    have done it this way.&#34; <BR> <BR>These are starting points. Once the face
    takes shape, it tends to gain a life of its own and evolves according to its own
    inner logic, and the concepts and references take a back seat to What Works.  <BR>

    <BR>This is quite similar to my approach. My thought experiments usually go something
    like &#39;What if Constantinople had never fallen to the Turks, and the Greek
    script had continued to evolve in closer contact to the Middle East than to Western
    Europe?&#39; <BR> <BR>Recently, I&#39;ve been asking myself the larger question:
    What if the advent of typography had not frozen our scripts? -- as mass printing
    also froze much of our knowledge: a kind of filter through which we perceive the
    manuscript world.&#42; I&#39;m increasingly interested in palaeography &#40;and
    not just because it gives me a whole new avenue of book collecting!&#41;, and
    the rich variety of letterforms before the standardisation of typography. I think
    it is ironical that much of the history of type, especially from the 19th century
    on, has involved a conscious effort to massively expand the variety of letterforms
    -- hence the huge number of fonts now available --, but most of it has been largely
    unconscious of the historical variety that preceded Gutenberg et al. <BR> <BR>
    <BR>&#42; Colette Sirat makes this point very well in her <i>Hebrew manuscripts
    of the Middle Ages,</i> when she notes how most of what we know about pre-typographic
    history, culture and thought is determined by which manuscripts were deemed commercially
    viable by the early printer publishers.'

    founding and printing derived directly from the specific formal writing hands
    employed in particular places at a specific point in time, and just about all
    type design since has been in reaction to and evolved from those models. Type
    designers have generally only gone back to pre-Gutenberg models for display types
    and to deliberately evoke historical periods, usually in fairly crude and superficial
    ways. There seems to have been relatively little exchange between type design
    and serious palaeographical scholarship. <BR> <BR>In broader terms, &#39;frozen&#39;
    is certainly too strong a word to  rhetorically describe the general solidifying
    of our image of the pre-typographic world based on what printers considered worth
    preserving in the new media. A better image is of print as a filter through which
    only some of the past has come down to us.

    But . . . <BR> <BR>When the work begins in earnest -- i.e., digital -- I usually
    start with &#39;h n o p&#39;. Establish stem weight, foot serif treatment, head
    serifs, ascender, descender, bowl, arched counterform, counter and width relationships;
    I might work these quite a bit and work out preliminary spacing as well.  <BR>
    <BR>Then typically &#39;m u i l&#39; are derived without sketches or scans. And
    more spacing tweaks. The &#39;r&#39; comes soon after and is sometimes worked
    directly on screen, sometimes scanned, depending upon the design.  <BR> <BR>&#39;b
    d&#39; might be derived at this point, to check and refine the bowl design. <BR>
    <BR>Then &#39;a g&#39; are brought in about now, maybe sooner. This is where things
    get interesting. These characters usually make it or break it for me. &#39;e&#39;
    might get scanned, or might get drawn directly on screen. Quite a bit of spacing
    tweaks may follow. <BR> <BR>After this, things progress variably. The goal is
    to get to &#39;hamburgefontsiv&#39; &#40;with &#39;pldc&#39; usually thrown in
    for good measure&#41;. I often work out comma, period, hyphen, and apostrophe
    even before lc is fully developed. Sometimes the question mark. And determine
    the spaceband. The point is to start setting as much trial text as soon as I can
    and then keep adding and refining. &#40;I will confess that &#39;k&#39; and &#39;x&#39;
    are almost always last.&#41; <BR> <BR>When I get to caps, &#39;H O&#39; are the
    standard starting point to establish height, weight, and width relation to each
    other and the lc. Spacing also gets some attention in relation to each other and
    lc. From there, the easy caps &#39;I E F T L&#39; are quickly derived. Then usually
    &#39;M N&#39; -- they might get sketched a bit first, and the &#39;M&#39; often
    scanned.  <BR> <BR>After that, usually the &#39;A V W&#39; or &#39;P R B&#39;.
    &#39;R&#39; is always sketched quite a bit and usually scanned. <BR> <BR>This
    is a general reflective description I&#39;m making up here, not any kind of well-honed,
    tried-and-true methodology. Just reflecting on how things seem to go these days
    and how my own personal, self-taught habits have developed. &#40;Interesting exercise.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not really as linear as it sounds, every new character can provoke
    reevaluation of everything else. <BR> <BR>Type design is still an evenings-and-weekends,
    in-between-jobs venture for me, so work on any given design will proceed slowly
    and in fits and starts.  <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>

    piece of wood for a handle. <BR> <BR>I do the whole alphabet on paper, pencil
    first, then marker. I use a mechanical pencil with 4H lead on a nice drafting
    paper. Sometimes it&#39;s marker first, then pencil if it&#39;s something more
    gestural. I&#39;ve usually work large, 8&#34; body height, but lately have been
    drawing smaller, 4-5&#34;. Then I scan them, digitize them, fiddle with the outlines,
    print them out and usually draw some again and scan them again.Then I do words
    and readust the characters accordingly. I go at the spacing and kerning the same
    way: space it, space it again, set it aside, then space it again.  <BR> <BR>I
    like the idea John Hudson mentioned, tape the drawing on the monitor, so I&#39;m
    going to try it. If it saves some scanning time that would be great. <BR> <BR>I
    could never get the hang of doing it by eye unless I was working on a tablet and

  body: <i>Do you think that ability to edit outlines directly in Metrics window is

    convenient. I would be happy just being able to grab nodes and handles and nudge
    them directly in the Metrics window. But I can&#39;t speak for anyone else.  <BR>
    <BR>And you might not want to listen to me, as I&#39;m not a huge FLab user yet.
    Still primarily stuck in the comfort of Fog. &#40;Though I&#39;m trying to make
    the move. But all my automatic habits are defeated and I hate having to struggle
    to relearn a new tool.&#41; <BR> <BR>But while I&#39;m at it, I will mention one
    pet peeve about the FLab metrics window. Because the data readout for the metrics
    is at the top of the window, when I want to toggle kerning on and off to compare
    the effect of kerning, the preview jumps up and down -- which completely defeats
    the ability to compare the effect.  <BR> <BR>Does this make sense? Does anyone
    else experience this and does it bug them?

    be quite a while before this one reaches fruition. &#40;It&#39;s already been
    gestating for four years&#41;. I think I may have finally found the right themes,
    but I have yet to pull them together, and the design is once again sidelined.  <BR>
    <BR>Ironically, I got sidetracked by something a colleague said. I was showing
    a few Stadler sketches and he mentioned an interesting possibility that he saw
    in them which was not in line with my [Neoclassical] concept, but which got me
    thinking about an older design I had stashed in a drawer. So I revisited the older
    concept &#40;something more Baroque&#41; and it suddenly gained legs. It&#39;s
    been getting all my available attention recently. <BR> <BR>This is sort of how
    it goes for me.  <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR> <BR>'
