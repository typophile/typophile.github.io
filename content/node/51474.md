  you find in your work that either brand guidelines, legislation for disabilities,
  or any other factors have an effect on typographical choices that you make when
  working? If so could you tell me how, and if they do, do you do anything outside
  of your 'paid' professional area to enable you to experiment with type that you
  normally wouldn't get a chance to?\r\n\r\nIf you could also tell me what field you
  work in, it would be incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nChris"

    Arial as the font to use. So sad, but thankfully there are assignments that give
    me free hands, too. Recently I actually bought a font when designing a suggestion
    for a campaign to a potential client. Nothing might come out of it, but at least
    I was able to use the fonts I wanted for the job. I'll put the price of the font
    towards company expenses.\r\n\r\nI'm a freelance/self employed graphic designer."

  body: Does web design count? Because there can be all sorts of type restrictions
    dues to technology and target audience constraints...

    issues surrounding web accessibility, etc. but would be very interested to hear
    your personal experiences of the matter.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nChris"

  body: "Well for instance building a website for a government organization means
    you have to work with a different set of constraints then say building a personal
    design/portfolio site. On a government site there's a strong emphasis on the lowest
    common denominator both in the content, which needs to be readily comprehended,
    as well as audience technology constraints (low bandwidth, older computers, limited
    or no Flash, limited JavaScript, older browsers, etc.) In such cases one may not
    be able to use such tricks like SiFR, or Flash, and even JavaScript DOM manipulation,
    as bandwidth and older computer issues make such technologies prohibitive. This
    makes it difficult to use anything but basic web fonts unless you resort to using
    images. However images can also run into bandwidth and accessibility issues. So
    like most design problems, it's a bunch of trade-offs and you have to carefully
    figure out what works best and strike a good balance given the project requirements.\r\n\r\nOn
    a personal portfolio site though - you're aiming for a different audience. Bandwidth
    is generally not a huge issue. You don't worry about whether the user has Flash
    or uses an up-to-date browser because those who don't are not your target audience.
    So you can create a much richer typographic experience because you don't apply
    the same constraints. Ultimately, it really comes down to the project requirements
    and the target audience."
