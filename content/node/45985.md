  Light\r\nXXX Regular\r\nXXX Bold\r\nXXX Black\r\n\r\nWhen I test the generated fonts
  with MS Font ValidatorI get OS/2 errors:\r\n\r\n'E2100A > bit in the fsSelection
  field doesn't match the name table's font subfamily string > fsSelection regular
  bit is set, but subfamily is Light'\r\n\r\n(I get the message in every weight except,
  obviously, in regular)\r\n\r\nI do not know how to fix that.\r\n\r\nI did the font
  naming following the instructions in the Fontlab Forum:\r\nhttp://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2843\r\n\r\nHow

  body: "If Font Validator reports that \"your subfamily is Light\" then you did the
    naming wrong. On FontLab Studio's first Font Info page, in the Style Name field,
    only four names are allowed: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic. Obviously,
    one of your fonts has \"Light\" there. That's wrong. You should put the true typographic
    style names into the OT Style Name field on the second Font Info page. But I thought
    I actually wrote this on the FontLab forum. \r\nA."

  body: "Sloppy reading on my part, sorry ...\r\nIf 'Black' is already part of the
    black weight's Family Name, then the according Style Name would be 'Regular'.
    Similar for the light weight. Since you get the error message even with the bold
    weight, you seem to have forgotten to check the Bold checkbox in the bold weight.
    (Whereas it should be unchecked in light, regular and black weight.)\r\nThis however
    would only be true if you intend to link regular with bold, but treat light and
    black as separate families on the level of Family Name / Style Name. Given your
    description, I am not sure if you followed the tips & tricks' <em>PostScript Type
    1</em> or the <em>OpenType</em> section."

  body: "Hi K.L. & Adam,\r\n\r\nThe family has only 4 members: Light, Regular, Bold,
    Black and no italics (it is a display font with no italics).\r\n\r\nFor TTF fonts
    shall I put different Family Names for Light and Black? \r\n\r\nOr can I have
    Light and Black under the same Family Name than Regular and Bold?\r\n(Reading
    'Learn FL Fast' -pag. 130- gives me the impression that the four members should
    only be Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic in TTF.)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Ramiro, \r\n\r\ntypically, you make the typographic \"Bold\" style act as
    a style-linked bold for the typographic \"Regular\". (The style-linked bold is
    the font which is chosen when the user clicks on a \"B\" button in an application,
    or hits Cmd-B / Ctrl-B). \r\n\r\nSo you typically have: \r\n<code>OT Family: XXX,
    OT Style: Regular, \r\n\_\_Family: XXX, Style: Regular\r\n\_\_Font is bold: no\r\nOT
    Family: XXX, OT Style: Bold,\r\n\_\_Family: XXX, Style: Bold, \r\n\_\_Font is
    bold: YES</code>\r\n\r\nThen for your typographic \"Light\" and your typographic
    \"Black\", you really have two choices (I've italicized the differences): \r\n\r\nSolution
    1: The Black font is on its own\r\n<code>OT Family: XXX, OT Style: Light, \r\n\_\_Family:
    XXX Light, Style: Regular\r\n\_\_Font is bold: no\r\nOT Family: XXX, OT Style:
    Black, \r\n\_\_<em>Family: XXX Black, Style: Regular\r\n\_\_Font is bold: no</em></code>\r\n\r\nSolution
    2: The Black font acts as the style-linked bold for the Light font\r\n<code>OT
    Family: XXX, OT Style: Light, \r\n\_\_Family: XXX Light, Style: Regular\r\n\_\_Font
    is bold: no\r\nOT Family: XXX, OT Style: Black, \r\n\_\_<em>Family: XXX Light,
    Style: Bold, \r\n\_\_Font is bold: YES</em></code>\r\n\r\nIt's really up to you,
    but I'd say in this case I'd go with solution 1. \r\n\r\nHowever, if your family
    had the typographic styles Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black, then you might
    consider making the Black font act as the style-linked bold of the Medium font,
    and leave the Light without a style-linked bold, or you could make the Medium
    act as the style-linked bold of the Light font, and leave the Black on its own,
    or you could make the Light, Medium and Black three independent fonts without
    any style linking. It's a design decision, really. \r\n\r\nAdam"
