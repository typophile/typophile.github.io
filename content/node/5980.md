  body: You&#39;re going to hate me for suggesting this, but I think this can be built
    from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pump-2/" target="_blank">Pump</a>
    with added round terminals &#40;easy to do&#41;. The hardest letter is the B and
    I think it is a reversed Pump E, combined with a curve that might have been the
    only thing they would have needed to draw themselves, besides the straight leg
    added to the P to form the R.  <BR> <BR>&#40;I didn&#39;t look back at the old
    thread to see if anyone else had suggested this outrage&#41;. Of course, given
    the ever-popular Bauhaus style and the urge to make yet another version of that
    simple geometric look, it&#39;s possible someone actually made a font like this,
    but it wouldn&#39;t have been necessary with so much existing &#39;raw material&#39;
    to use.
