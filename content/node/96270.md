body: 'I am working on a Font that we wish to function using MSWord on both Windows
  and Mac OS X.  The Font requires numerous diacritic-like glyphs placed above numerous
  base characters.  Our preference is to have the glyphs composed on-the-fly using
  font technologies on both platforms instead of having to populate the Unicode Private
  User Area with upwards of several hundreds of glyphs.  Working with VOLT or FontForge
  I believe will give us the result we need on the Windows side using Opentype''s
  ''mark'' and ''mkmk'' features, or ''ccmp''.  However, MS Word 2011 on the Mac does
  not appear to honor the Opentype tables.  If this be the case, how does one provide
  the same functionality as Opentype''s ''mark'' and ''mkmk'' features on the Mac?
  I don''t see how Apple Advanced Typography state machines do the same sort of thing,
  but they somehow seem to... '

    or PowerPoint but Word 2011 for Mac supports ligatures, stylistic sets, context
    alternative characters and number forms for OpenType; not amazing but a start.
    I have not tested these features extensively but have seen reports that they are
    either inconsistent across some fonts or do not port well to the Windows 2010
    version.\r\n\r\n[edit] Sorry John, just realised that you were probably talking
    about additional support beyond these features.\r\n\r\nHowever Word 2011 does
    not accept what it deems to be fonts with problematic naming conventions. [[Recommendations
    for dealing with font problems in Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac|Adam Twardoch has
    posted naming guidelines for FontLab]] that help to address that particular issue.
    For example, I have encountered problems with the larger FontFont families (e.g.,
    Meta), which use a naming structure that Office 2011 clearly does not play well
    with.\r\n"

  body: John, I think as a rule (sadly) the Mac versions have always been an afterthought
    and either by virtue of application level or system level support I do not doubt
    that the Mac versions suffer by comparison but I have noticed a significant and
    positive improvement in moving from the 2004 version to the 2011 version.
