body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I am a graphic design student and I&#39;m quite smitten with
  type. I&#39;ve noodled over type in Illustrator before, but I&#39;m thinking of
  becoming more serious and buying a proper type editing app. The obvious choices
  are FontLab or its little brother TypeTool. If I really become obsessive about this,
  I&#39;m affraid I&#39;ll outgrow TypeTool, but I don&#39;t want to buy FontLab for
  the odd occassion I might use it. Any thoughts? <BR> <BR>The student discount is
  50% so FontLab isn&#39;t quite as big an investment, but TypeTool would only be
  $49! <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Scott

    rest when you graduate &#40;or when you sell some work created using FL&#41;.
    See what he says. My guess he&#39;ll go for it. <BR> <BR>Si

  body: I agree that the 50% student discount for FontLab 4.6 makes the price bearable.
    I actually used the discount myself when I first bought FontLab in 1997. FontLab
    4.6 can do a lot more than TypeTool. Your best shot should be to really get the
    demo versions of both applications and try them out.  <BR> <BR>Since many other
    students scrapped together the money for the student price so far, it wouldn&#39;t
    be particularly fair to offer some special conditions to just single students,
    so I guess we will stick to our regular terms, which I think are quite attractive
    anyway.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.

  body: That&#39;s a shame - I always admired FontLab&#39;s flexibility in dealing
    with special cases. I suppose this is the post-Enron FontLab - a level playing
    field for all.  <BR> <BR>The idea of trying out the demo versions is a good one
    though. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: Got the demos, now I just need to spend time with each and decide. I never
    expected any special consideration since no other software manufacturer does that.
    Besides, 50% off is very generous, even compared to academic programs from other
    companies. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the tip about the demos, <BR>Scott

  body: Adam, I remember hearing that customers who previously purchased TypeTool
    could have that amount subtracted from the cost of FontLab if they upgraded later.
    Is that true? <BR> <BR>Scott, if it is true, then buying TypeTool might be your
    best bet, as you could always uprgrade to FontLab later without having to spend
    anything extra.

  body: Adam, any idea what the upgrade price to 5.0 will be when it is released?
    Or when that will be? I finally managed to scrape up the money to buy FontLab
    and I don&#39;t want to feel like I should have waited longer to buy FontLab.
    &#39;Cause I couldn&#39;t. :-&#41;

  body: '&#62; since no other software manufacturer does that. <BR> <BR>Especially
    for educational purposes we developed the free Light version of DTL FontMaster.
    In comparison with the full version there are a few limitations, like the size
    of the font databases which are restricted to 256 glyphs. And it does not allow
    you to generate TrueType or OpenType fonts. <BR> <BR>Obviously DTL FontMaster
    is not really a program for the rest of us; it has a somewhat steep learning curve.
    Personally, I don&#39;t think that any other program matches the capabilities
    of FM when it comes to font database handling &#40;for instance the exchange of
    data between databases&#41; and batch processing, especially with the OpenType
    production in mind. Not everybody needs to handle large amounts of data though.  <BR>
    <BR>Practically no end user will be interested in the tool that was used for the
    production of the purchased font; the font should be well made and reliable. For
    the font manufacturer the production has to be controllable and economical. For
    most font manufacturers other programs than DTL FontMaster seem to be sufficient.
    What scares me though, is that sometimes in the educational world but also at
    font related technical events there seems to be a sort of mono culture nowadays.
    I admit that we do the same at the DTL FontMaster Conferences, but the naming
    of the event is in this case clear.'

  body: I think the educational world is concerned to prepare students for work in
    the &#39;real world&#39;, so there is a tendency to promote the use of whatever
    tool is perceived to be &#39;the professional choice&#39;. This is one reason
    why Fontographer was taught for so long, because even when it became obvious that
    FontLab was better, more regularly updated, etc., the perception was still that
    Fontographer dominated the market. Now FontLab dominates the market, so it gets
    most attention in educational settings. As you suggest, Frank, DTL FontMaster
    is something of a niche tool that meets very specific needs of some font developers.
    So it is regretable that DTL FontMaster does not get more attention in the educational
    world, but this is also understandable given typical pedagogical goals.

  body: I am lecturing writing &#40;calligraphy&#41;, type designing and font producing
    for almost 18 years at the Royal Academy at The Hague and purely the theoretical
    aspects for ten years at the Plantin Society in Antwerp now. My pedagogical goal
    has always been to widen the horizon of my students without pushing my personal
    preferences. By giving practical and theoretical information but above all stimulating
    the gathering of information by the students themselves, I always hoped and still
    hope to provide a solid basis for their further personal development. Although
    my lessons on font production in the post graduate program Type &amp; Media at
    The Hague are mainly focused on DTL FontMaster, I always list and discuss other
    programs. My position as lecturer is not to promote FM but to inform the students
    about the technical possibilities for font development and to show how we at DTL
    deal with it. At the end they have to make up their mind themselves. <BR> <BR>Let
    me make clear that the development of FM is the result of the internal production
    needs at DTL and URW&#43;&#43;. I am happy to state that although we sell the
    product, the further development is not depending on sales numbers at all. It
    is just a wonderful program &#40;&#39;niche tool&#39; are not my words&#41; for
    professional font production and Dr. Juergen Willrodt, Peter Rosenfeld, myself
    and the rest of the FM Team is proud and very happy to work with it and to work
    on it and we will further develop and enhance the program the coming decades for
    sure. Considering the price for the full product, it must be clear that we never
    aimed at a big market. The free Light version is just a service to students. Looking
    at our list of customers and -of course- our own production, DTL FontMaster is
    absolutely &#39;the professional choice&#39; also. And please correct me if I
    am wrong, but I have the strong feeling that since we introduced DTL FontMaster
    at the ATypI conference in Copenhagen in 2001, we have in some way inspired the
    FontLab &#40;add on&#41; developers also. <BR> <BR>The fact that history seems
    to repeat itself in the educational world now FontLab has taken the position of
    Fontographer should in my opinion actually be a reason to learn a lesson and alter
    the situation. The fact that something is mainstream does not mean that it is
    automatically better, as Apple convincingly proves with its products. I underline
    here my worries about the current situation in the educational world and tech
    forums &#40;the FM Team is in for any invitations&#41;. But maybe I am wrong and
    is for instance the active promotion for the current dominant product on this
    forum really built on altruism.
