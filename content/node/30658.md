  used in the logo of the football (soccer) team I support and have come up with a
  pretty close ID, and that is Albertus.  It isn't quite right though...is there a
  font similar that it could be? or is it a custom one maybe?\r\n\r\nmany thanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You're right that it's similar to Albertus. In fact, my guess is that this
    is a customization of that font. The serifs were expanded, or re-drawn, but the
    basic letterforms seem just about a match for Albertus in every other respect.\r\n\r\n-

  body: I believe this is hand lettered. Many of the same characters are slightly
    different.
