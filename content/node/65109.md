  in one Liga feature. Is there any limit? Can I add more than one Liga feature in
  the same font (Liga1, Liga2...)?\r\n\r\nKonstantinos Siskakis\r\nAnagrafi\r\nGreece\r\n"

  body: "You can put all the ligatures into one liga feature, but you may need to
    break them into multiple lookup subtables. There is no practical limit on the
    number of substitutions you can associate with a feature (a feature is just a
    tag), but there are limits on the number of substitutions you can put into a single
    lookup table.\r\n\r\nWhat software are you using for the OpenType Layout?"

  body: "Typograph, that isn't what I meant by 'multiple lookup subtables'. I mean
    that lookups have a maximum size, and hence multiple lookups might be necessary
    for a very large number of e.g. ligature substitutions.\r\n\r\nI don't use FontLab
    for OpenType Layout work, so someone else will have to explain the syntax to separate
    lookups."

  body: "In FontLab the syntax ought to look something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    liga { # Default ligatures</code>\r\n\r\n<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;  lookup liga_1 { #
    lookup subtable 1</code>\r\n<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    sub f i by fi;</code>\r\n<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    \   sub f l by fl;</code>\r\n<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;  } liga_1;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    \ lookup liga_2 { # lookup subtable 2</code>\r\n<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    \ <em>etc.</em></code>\r\n\r\n<code>} liga;</code>\r\n\r\nWith 1,200 ligatures,
    grouping them into separate lookups should also make them all a bit easier to
    manage."

  body: "As I understand it, the limit is 64K per lookup. The issue most often crops
    up with the <code>kern</code> feature, which can become quite large even in modest-sized
    fonts. You'll usually know you've hit the limit when your feature fails to compile
    and the error mentions something like \"offset overflow.\" (The <code>kern</code>
    feature is easier to deal with since it supports subtable breaks, so you can divide
    it into subtables with simple \"<code>subtable;</code>\" statements.)\r\n\r\nIt's
    worth mentioning that the order of lookup subtables does matter, just as with
    the order of statements and features. There's actually a flaw in my example code
    above; the lookups should be in the opposite order. If \"<code>sub f i by fi</code>\"
    runs first, then \"<code>sub f f i by ffi</code>\" won't do anything since every
    instance of \"<code>f i</code>\" has already been substituted by \"<code>fi</code>\".
    (Sure, \"<code>sub f fi by ffi</code>\" would work, but feels less elegant.) Be
    careful to keep potential conflicts such as this in mind when organizing your
    code.\r\n\r\n"
