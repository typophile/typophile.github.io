  literally communicate what they sell.\r\n\r\nCan you see on these logo's that [[http://www.fratellirossetti.com/]]
  sells Italian shoes and [[http://www.blacktomato.com/]], luxury holidays? Nevertheless
  they are successful brands. Rossetti communicates timeless style, Black Tomato unconventional
  experiences. That's enough, no? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I don't think there's a <em>should</em> or <em>should not</em> choice between
    being literal or abstract. Either can work, but logos designed to convey the personality
    the the organization or product they represent usually work better, even though
    many clients tend to want something more concrete and representational.

  body: "A logo's purpose is just to identify the company, hopefully in a way that
    captures some of the company's spirit. Some of the most famous logos \u2014 Apple,
    Mercedes, Nike, Izod, Paramount, Shell Oil, etc \u2014 communicate little or nothing
    about the company's products.\r\n\r\nIf you can also communicate the company's
    products, that can be good but generally doesn't work well unless the company
    is known for just ONE service or product. A real estate company, for example.\r\n\r\nIt's
    the marketing that makes people remember the logo and associate it with the company
    and its products."
