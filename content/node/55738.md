  body: "I think it's Bembo Black. Matches a sample in \"Homage to the Alphabet\"
    book from Phil's Photo, which is film type. I need to see if digital version is
    available.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bembo/extra-bold/|Bembo Extra Bold]]
    looks almost the same as the sample of Black in the book. I can't find a digital
    Bembo Black.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for this - i think bebo black might be the closest match. I'm looking
    for similar weight serifs with the same feel (without the harshness of Clarendon
    black). Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nS"

  body: "The old Font Bank collection included some extra heavy versions of familiar
    type faces and [[http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/bianca.htm|Bianca]] was
    their name for what looked like a very heavy high x-height version of Bembo.  \r\n\r\nIn
    a more general answer to your question about heavy weight serifs, if you don't
    want Clarendon styles, avoid slabs, but any other Black versions of serif fonts
    might be worth looking at. For example,the Black version of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-galliard/black/|Galliard]]
    is pretty attractive, in my opinion. There are many others to look at though.\r\n\r\n-
