  body: I don't know what it is, but I would advise you not to put (x) in the title
    of your post. The admin who watches the Type ID Board adds that when a typeface
    has been identified. By including it, you are, in effect, telling everyone to
    ignore your question because it appears that it's already been answered.

  body: "As the one who made the post you can edit the title, and Mark's advice is
    good.\r\n\r\nThis 'techno' style is probably a freebie you can find at Dafont
    under techno>scifi category. For some reason, techno fonts are favorites of amateur
    designers.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
