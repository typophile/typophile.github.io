  for having ascenders exceed caps height, is it just a style or does it help when
  reading small copy or large bodies of text?\r\n\r\n2. When developing a sans inspired
  Hebrew character set, is there any reason to develop an italic set as well? From
  what I understand, Hebrew has no true italics, but are italics used with any frequency
  in modern day text settings using Hebrew?\r\n\r\n3. What's the reasoning behind
  some Small Caps exceeding x height is it just preference depending on the dimensions
  of they typeface or is it just about aesthetics?"

  body: "1. It certainly helps in words like Illusion. Of course, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/18300\">the
    other way around</a> works too.\r\n\r\n2. Don't know. But consider Greek, which
    didn't traditionally have Italic, or German, which didn't traditionally have Bold,
    but used letterspacing for emphasis.\r\n\r\n3. It's more than just \"some\". I
    haven't done a survey, but it may be the other way around. In my own case, I always
    make small caps taller than x-height. The reason is two-fold: firstly to disambiguate
    C, O, S, U, V, W and X (even more in Cyrillic), and secondly so that acronyms
    really do stand out in U&lc text -- small caps need to be taller, because lower
    case includes extenders. \r\n\r\nIn typography, aesthetics isn't \"just\", it's
    functional on many levels; visual ergonomics, if you will.\r\n\r\n(BTW Mike, a
    couple is generally considered to be two, but whatever turns you on :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>\"What is the reasoning for having ascenders exceed caps height\"</cite>\r\nIn
    addition to the differentiation issue Nick mentioned, it might help to think of
    it the other way round. The ascenders (and descenders) and their relation to x-height
    determine the vertical proportions in the lowercase \u2013 which is what people
    will usually read (in text fonts at least), so I'd suspect those should be determined
    first. The caps are somewhat independent of this relation, and can be shorter
    than the ascenders. This can make sense if you're looking at languages like German,
    which use a lot of caps, and you might want the caps to stick out less. Especially
    if for instance your font is rather wide, caps at full ascender height might look
    too massive (since caps quite often enclose space [like an \"O\"], whereas most
    ascenders are just sticks)."

  body: '1. I am not a professional, but here are a few assumptions: Tall capitals
    dominate a letter string in contradiction to tall ascenders. It is easier to recognize
    taller ascenders, if they follow a capital. I think, they can improve the rhythm
    of the text. And probably they offer more flexibility with regard to the design
    of the bowls (in b and d), because the bowl should not dominate these letters.
    But maybe the ascender height is even more important with regard to the design
    of the f. Furthermore I assume, that they can slightly (!) improve the gray value
    in case of relatively long lines (and big line spacing).'

    as random characters that enhance an alphabet. It's also the calligraphy thing.

  body: "Note that Jenson's face had massive ascender-height capitals, but Griffo
    made the improvement soon after (\"Bembo\" the typeface).\r\n550 years ago.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the modern style put caps at ascender height, 200 years ago.\r\n\r\nSo, a different
    strategy for oldstyle and modern.\r\n\r\nCarter's Olympian was the first 20th
    century news font to have ascenders taller than caps.\r\nThis trend has continued,
    and now faces like H&FJ's Chronicle leverage this effect mightily. "

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nSmall Caps are generally taller than x-height. Petite Caps are
    the size of x-height.\r\nThere are also Quad- and Medium\u2013 Caps (according
    to Maxim Zhukov)\r\n\r\nNick, \r\n\r\nFor this reason Cyrillic typographers manually
    increase the Small Caps' size. \r\nI designed a Cyrillic typeface with an additional
    stylistic set that has taller Small Caps (85% compared to 80% of Cap Height).\r\nBut
    it needs to be used with caution and cannot be used in multilingual texts.\r\n\r\n"
