  body: "Well, you can't assert that it as some sort of post-modernist attempt: in
    the most generous scenario, it was a modernist attempt. ;)\r\n\r\nRenaissance
    \"humanism\" was actually a neo-classicism (getting inspiration in Ancient Greece
    and Rome), with a step forward: integrating painture (that was considered a m\xE9tier
    of artisans, not artists), for example, with the liberal arts (math, geometry,
    stone-masonry); it was about status quo, since it was in the Renaissance that
    painters started to sign their work, construct their work in conical perspective
    and, of course, trying to create geometrically constructed letterforms (check
    Durer's work, for example).\r\n\r\nThe idea of humanism, philosophically speaking,
    was that Man was the main character in life, not God; so Man's creations should
    serve men, or express Man, from it's point of view: rationality was Man's triumph.\r\n\r\nAnd
    post-modernism is not an revivalist attitude: if we check Lyotard's writings,
    it's more a disenchanted view on History (a sort of post-WW2 trauma), that says
    that nothing is special, so everything can be made special -- anything goes.\r\n\r\nSo,
    answering your questions:\r\n\r\n1. If we understand this question as \"was there
    any other breaking with the old attitude before the Quattrocento\", then yes.
    Even in writing. The whole Middle-Ages was about that, but not in a \"breaking
    against God\" attitude (although looking at Bosch work still makes me suspicious
    about this,since it's so filled with pagan references). In type, it was mostly
    about national and cultural identity, both calligraphy-wise and writing systems.\r\n\r\n2.
    Morris was clearly a pre-Modernist, since he was a Romantic. Or better, a pre-Rafaelite.
    The Industrial Revolution was happening in his time, along with the liberal shift
    of society. The pre-Rafaelites used themes of pre-Renaissance as a rebellious
    attitude against the Academy that had become too canonical; in the other hand,
    they started exploring naturalist and every-day-life themes (something almost
    new, if we look to Turner or Courbet) also as a \"breaking the canonical chains\"
    thing.\r\n\r\nBack to Morris: the standardization that the machine brought made
    the impression that artistry would soon become irrelevant: so Morris tried to
    pick up on what a typesetting machine could not do. Even Gill wrote about the
    effects of the industrialization had on typesetting. And Morris when way back
    in time than to the Renaissance: he has beautifull Gothic-inspired books from
    the Kelmscott Press.\r\n\r\nSo no, not a post-Modernist attempt: I believe it
    was a pre-Modernist one.\r\n\r\nAnd sorry for the long post, I just couldn't help
    myself. :P"

  body: "Let's see now; at one point, there were rustic capitals and uncials, and
    then Charlemagne came along.\r\n\r\nCarolingian writing was sort of legible, and
    then gradually morphed into blackletter.\r\n\r\nHumanistic writing did indeed
    evoke Roman incised stone capitals, like those of the Trajan Column. And it is
    known that this was connected to a larger movement aimed at integrating the classics
    into scholarship.\r\n\r\nWas this post-mediaevalism the post-modernism of its
    time? I would be leery of such analogies. Post-modernism is an attempt to sail
    into uncharted waters on the basis that even modernism is inadequate; the humanistic
    movement was aimed at removing the stifling hand of Church domination from all
    aspects of life.\r\n\r\nTo conflate a practical movement aimed at legibility in
    writing and freedom in life with post-modernism is, in my opinion, to give post-modernism
    undeserved praise."

    all the Middle Age. You see, the notion of the Middle Age as a single historic
    period is an evention of the Renaissance. They called it the Dark Age in opposition
    to their era of Light. But we can't judge the Middle as something obscure and
    non-diverse -- it was quite the opposite.\r\n\r\nCyrillic is a medieval creation,
    as Slavonic. We had the Norse kingdoms changing writing systems a lot, the arabic
    invasions in Iberia (and their numerals spreading to the latim alphabet), barbarians
    bringing new sounds and the need for new glyphs, and just to name a few.\r\n\r\nAnd
    contrary to the usual belief, cultural exchange in Western Europe was huge. Central
    Europe had a lot of contact with the middle east and Asia.\r\n\r\nSo, as I said
    before, it was more more like a modernist attempt: throwing the heritage and it's
    diversity away, in an illusion of a civilizational pinnacle."

  body: "It definitely is true that progress took place during the Middle Ages. For
    example, eyeglasses were invented in the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere was
    Classical Antiquity. Greece was a cultural pinnacle - pioneering in democracy,
    in mathematics, and in philosophy. Rome was not as inspiring, but it did maintain
    peace and order.\r\n\r\nSo after the Christianized Roman Empire collapsed, allowing
    barbarian depredations, this was viewed as going downhill by the people at the
    time. But the mediaeval world progressed out of the Dark Ages into the later Middle
    Ages.\r\n\r\nHowever, with things like the Inquisition, one thing the Middle Ages
    was not was free. Authorities with the ability to initiate force presumed to intrude
    on freedom of conscience and thought. The rule of the Catholic Church in that
    period was an early example of totalitarianism. Viewing the Renaissance as an
    important positive event is no more biased than viewing the fall of the Soviet
    Union as an important positive event."

    the Baroque era that the Church applied the inquisition to the letter and not
    during the Middle Age. Some printers and typeface designers of the XVI th century
    were converted to the reformed Church therefore they were considered heretics.

    Anyway and going back to the initial topic, I still wondered if there was a philosopher
    or a monk who changed the official script with a breaking up leaning before the
    Renaissance. What about Alcuin? How do you interpret his writing reform?"
