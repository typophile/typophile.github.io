body: "One can endlessly discuss to what extend an EULA permits the editing, conversion
  or wrapping of a font, as long as applications make it possible to freely and uncontrolled
  apply these actions to fonts by for instance end users, copyrights will be infringed.
  So, perhaps the developers of font production tools, like DTL, should try to make
  the applications somewhat more restrictive when it comes to altering fonts (-formats).\r\n\r\nOne
  way to do this that came to my mind, is to make use of the vendor ID in the \u2018OS/2\u2019
  table. A font editor, converter or wrapper looks at this table and checks an online
  database where the vendor ID is stored <strong>plus</strong> a key code (which could
  be just the string \u2018public\u2019) supplied by the vendor in question. The font
  tool checks the database and will make editing/conversion/wrapping possible if the
  key is \u2018public\u2019 or else will ask for the key code. If the entered key
  code is correct, the program will allow (also future) editing by the app of the
  fonts of the vendor in question (a vendor should not be hampered by this functionality
  when it comes to editing his own fonts, of course). This use of the vendor ID would
  also work with older fonts, i.e., no additional table information is required.\r\n\r\nThis
  way the vendor is more in charge, because he can give/sell the key to third parties
  for the editing of his fonts \u2013or not. The key is not static and can be changed
  at any time by the vendor. However, if a program is unlocked for a certain vendor,
  it remains unlocked (although one could think of a mechanism that checks the database
  for an updated key code once per half year or so). Such a protection also has an
  advantage for the font tool manufacturers, because illegally distributed copies
  will not be unlocked or only temporarily unlocked for all or even any vendor ID\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAt
  the recent ATypI conference I briefly discussed the matter with some other application
  developers. Because Microsoft is registering the vendor ID\u2019s, the company comes
  to mind for storing the vendor keys also. The first reactions from the contacted
  parties were promising. However, if it comes to the appliance of this idea, it will
  take some time before apps will include the checking functionality. Older versions
  of the apps in question can be used to edit fonts then still, of course, but technically
  these will probably become obsolete in time. Also some older tools will perhaps
  be difficult to update, or some free tools might circumvent the limitation. But
  such a system will at least to a certain extend help to protect the rights of the
  font manufacturers, I reckon. And it is a message to those who work with/on fonts,
  that copyrights should be respected.\r\n\r\nI am curious what the type community
  thinks of this idea.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

  body: "Charles: <em>Assumes \u201Ctype community\u201D = \u201Cfont designers\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nBasically,
    with \u2018type community\u2019 I was thinking of everyone who designs, produces
    or works with fonts, and I reckon that everybody in this community wants to protect
    their and their colleague\u2019s rights as much as possible.\r\n\r\nCharles: <em>Perhaps
    this is an unproductive way to think of the type community?</em>\r\n\r\nI am afraid
    that I completely miss your point here. The only reason that I came up with the
    vendor ID based plan, is to protect the rights of the type designers and font
    foundries. It would only affect font production tools or font editors and not
    for instance desktop publishing applications. So, one can simply not edit, convert,
    or wrap fonts without the permission of the owner of the font. Such protection
    would especially cost the programmers of font tools, like ours, extra work and
    that could be considered unproductive. But I am not sure if you meant that.\r\n\r\nFEB"

  body: "I view the primary type community as people who use fonts, and people who
    read. We are all grateful to the font designers who provide us with tools, just
    like we are grateful to the layout programmers who provide us with other tools.\r\n\r\nMy
    rants on the subject are probably too common on typophile, but I'll just repeat
    that not a month goes by that I do not have to modify a font. Usually something
    trivial, as a character needed that is not included in the foundry version. Say,
    a diacritical needed. Or, a raised comma, which is not the same character as an
    apostrophe -- just check the Unicode charts. Often kerning, which is an individual
    preference. Designers are \"always right?\" Not when punctuation is so tight as
    to rival a diacritical. Esp. when the editor marks it \"P.E.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an
    exaggeration, but designers think about letterforms and graphic shapes. Much of
    the type community thinks about texts. Rarely do we hang letterforms in museums;
    most common is to use them to present texts."

  body: "James: <em>This solution will never work.</em>\r\n\r\nThis depends on how
    and what you measure. Whatever the \u2018physical\u2019 system for font protection
    is, It will never be waterproof because there probably will be ways explored and
    found to circumvent it, or because of legacy limitations. But at least this solution
    doesn\u2019t cost font producers any extra work, except for controlling the vendor
    key (assuming that vendor ID\u2019s are always included in the TTF/OTF fonts)
    and it would be backwards compatible too.\r\n\r\nSo, I would actually expect owners
    of font data to embrace <strong>any</strong> \u2018physical\u2019 system that
    helps (a bit) to protect their intellectual property, especially because there
    is none at the moment whatsoever \u2013as far as I know. And when it comes to
    vulnerability, in general most defense systems are built step by step anyway,
    I reckon.\r\n\r\nCharles: <em>[\u2026] not a month goes by that I do not have
    to modify a font.</em>\r\n\r\nThat is fine as long as the EULA that came with
    the font allows the end user to do this. And with a vendor ID/key controlled system
    this will be possible still in case the owner of the font permits this kind of
    actions.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

    those words under my breath.\r\n\r\nYou want to protect your fonts from piracy.
    I applaud. So you hire $300-an-hour lawyers to write a restrictive EULA. You propose
    a software \"fix\" to enforce it. You are apparently unaware that EULA makes the
    product unuseable, at least to one segment of what I condsider the type community.
    A lack of knowledge of the workflows needed to turn letterforms into text is not
    a laudable trait for one in the \"type community.\" \r\n\r\nOr perhaps you don't
    consider the people who set type, who read books, who search files, as a part
    of the type community?\r\n\r\nThere is a growing movement amongst publishers to
    say \"Adobe only.\" Usually I can get them to also allow fonts from Carter & Cone
    and Stone. But then, Matthew and Sumner understand the type community to include
    people who use type."

  body: "Besides the other objections, this proposed scheme assumes that a given vendor
    will have all of their fonts either \"public\" or \"protected\" and not have some
    in each camp.\r\n\r\nAlso, if a vendor wants to allow a given specific user to
    modify a \"protected\" font, what do they do? Seems like they either have to tell
    the user the key code, or generate a custom version of the font to allow modifications.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, the first thing that will happen is somebody will write a utility that
    simply takes a font and removes the vendor ID so fonts can be modified. But that's
    not really the point, this is another \"garden fence\" class protection, isn't
    it? But I think the EULA and the fact that one has to actually have and use a
    font editor already constitute a sufficient \"garden fence\"....\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"
