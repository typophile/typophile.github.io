body: In another Design forum thread, it was mentioned that Freight Sans has a too-tight
  word spacing as part of its design, but that word spacing "is a snap to adjust in
  Quark" (Pattyfab). Can someone walk me through adjusting word spacing in Mac Quark
  6.5 or 7--I've searched in vain for where and what to click.
