  body: ' I don&#39;t get it. Am I supposed to try to guess who made that shirt? Or
    do you mean the Roy Preston one? <BR> <BR>Anyway, I think it&#39;s bad to try
    to publicly &#40;sp?&#41; guess who made which shirt before the winner is declared.
    But since it could be so much fun maybe you should allow a short lag between choosing
    the winner and annoucing which one it is, so that in the interim we can try guessing.
    And the person who guesses the most gets a free shirt. Deal? <BR> <BR>hhp '
