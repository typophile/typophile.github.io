  body: "The letters have a very energetic and very American feel to them. Good, if
    that's what you're aming for.  The Q is weak, very obviously constructed from
    the O, which doesn't necessarily make sense for cursive. The Z seems a bit awkward.\r\n\r\nBUT:
    A script alphabet without lower case is of extremely limited use. What do you
    have in mind? Decorative initials? You don't seriously contemplate using this
    in all caps, do you?"

  body: the problem with doing an all-uppercase script face is that script capitals
    don't really work too well together. a real challenge would be to make and all
    UC script face that DOES work.

    script font or even maybe an unicase!?

  body: "Jill,\r\nIt seems as though the script you are doing would be hard to cut
    and read in stone.  Also, script capitals are tough to read anyway.  Script needs
    a lower case in my opinion. Do you have photos of the grave stones you saw?  I
    would be curious to see how it worked carved in stone.\r\n\r\nWhat you have going
    is a loose spontaneous looking hand.  You might think of it as an informal script
    somewhere between Pauls more formal \"Zaner\" and Christian's more personal \"Dear
    Sarah\" It needs either some real refinement or to become more casual to find
    its place.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
