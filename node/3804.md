body: Is there an advantage to decomposing accented glyphs  <BR>derived from components?
  Years ago I remember a reason <BR>for doing this with Fontographer as there was
  a snag with <BR>certain Windows systems.  <BR> <BR>Recently I&#39;ve noticed my
  OpenType fonts not showing their <BR>accented characters on the Myfonts.com server.
  I decomposed <BR>the accented glyphs and everything now appears. <BR>Is this an
  OT thing? Fontlab?

  body: You should not decompose for TrueType fonts, but you should decompose for
    PostScript fonts. Maintain FontLab sources with undecomposed composites, and only
    decompose when you generate fonts. Be careful not to save a decomposed source
    over your composed one.
