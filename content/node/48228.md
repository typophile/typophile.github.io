  but there's nothing on Wikipedia or, it seems, any decent article on the rest of
  the Googleable Internet. Any suggestions?

    x 7 (roughly) film neg in (it had aluminum handles on the end)  and it jumped
    up and down and sideways in an enclosed environment... exposing it to Agfa film.
    That was after the typesetters had done their thing on the old CRT's, kerning
    and all. I remember it as being Alphatype machinery. Not the PT. Does that ring
    a bell. It made a hell of a noise.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    I found <a href="http://bellsouthpwp2.net/b/c/bcarberry/tp.html">this</a> to give
    me some of the technicals. That diagram looks like something a cartoon character
    would get pounded and hammered through. The article talked about white photo paper,
    but I'm wondering how you got color letters and/or color/illustrated/photo backgrounds?

    if I understand your question correctly. Photo type was always black and white,
    as far as I know.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] P.S. Here are some of the <a href=\"http://www.incipit.com/linkrefs2.html\">photos</a>

  body: "<em>I\u2019m wondering how you got color letters and/or color/illustrated/photo
    backgrounds?</em>\r\n\r\nIn the olden days (before we did everything on computers),
    all \"camera-ready artwork\" was in black and white--not even gray was allowed.
    If you had full color or grayscale artwork to print, that had to be handled separately
    and \"stripped into\" the negative film before making printing plates.\r\n\r\nThe
    black areas on your camera-ready artwork were the parts that would be inked on
    the press. So, whatever color ink was going to be used, that was what color it
    would be, even though it was black on your artwork. Whatever was white on your
    camera-ready art would not get ink, not get printed. So those areas would be whatever
    color the paper was (usually white) or whatever other colors were already printed
    (or would be printed) in those areas.\r\n\r\nGrayscale images could not be printed
    as is and needed to be converted to black and white \"halftones\", which are really
    only black and white, but give the illusion of shades of gray by using tiny dots
    of different sizes.\r\n\r\nFull color images needed to be \"separated\" using
    colored filters into four different halftone images. The four images would be
    printed in four different inks--black, cyan, magenta, and yellow--giving the illusion
    of full color.\r\n\r\nAll of these elements--black and white artwork or halftones--would
    be photographed with high contrast negative film and assembled together by a \"stripper\"
    using red tape (which photographed as black).\r\n\r\nYou could also tell the printer
    that you wanted certain areas or elements of your artwork to be a certain shade
    of gray by making a note on the artwork. The stripper would make a new negative
    film element of that part of the art using a halftone filter and strip it into
    position in place of the original.\r\n\r\nAfter all the negatives were assembled
    and ready, they would be used to make the plates (which are photo-sensitive) by
    making a kind of contact print.\r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, the basic principles
    of all this are still true, but the computer has made negative stripping unnecessary
    and obsolete, and all the complicated planning and set up that used to be needed
    to put \"color letters on photo backgrounds\" is just a matter of moving things
    around on a computer screen and clicking on color swatch palettes and making sure
    thing are stacked right the right order. The software takes care of the rest.
    We don't even need negatives anymore--the black and white images needed for printing
    are exposed, fully assembled, directly to the printing plate. \r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand, you never had to worry about missing fonts back then."
