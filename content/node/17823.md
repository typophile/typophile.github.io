body: I'm reading a book called The Separation by Christopher Priest. It is a story
  that partly takes place in the Nazi Germany, and the German greetings of the time
  like Heil etc are set in italics, as is typical. When the characters are meant to
  be speaking German (but it is written in English, kind of dubbed) it is typed inside
  [ ] -brackets. This is the first time I have come across this idea, and wonder if
  it is a common practice? Have you seen other ways to deal with this kind of situation?

  body: I know that in comic books, it's common practice to write pre-translated foreign
    dialogue in the greater-than/less-than brackets.  (Sorry, but I can't remember
    their technical name off the top of my head, and the site keeps thinking it's
    code when I try typing them in.  Oh, well.)  ^_^
