body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI am about to venture into digitising a handwriting style. I
  have been recommended FontLab, which I'm looking into.\r\nI have never designed
  a typeface as a whole and would appreciate any advice as to what is the best way
  on digitizing a handwriting style? I am particularly concerned with linking glyphs
  that naturally join together.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way of going about this?\r\nAre
  there any 'best practice' ways of doing this?\r\n\r\nShould I just roll-up my sleeves
  and start going for it?\r\n\r\nAll and any advice very welcome,\r\nMany thanks\r\nIntrepid
  me"

  body: "If you have connectors on either side of a character, this is one way to
    do it...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scripti_4067.gif]\r\n\r\nFontLab
    will display the coordinates when you click on a node; if you set both sidebearings
    to zero, and the numbers for the vertical coordinates for the tops and bottoms
    of the connectors match (top-to-top and bottom-to-bottom), then the glyphs will
    join. You may have to fiddle with the bezier handles on these nodes to get the
    angles right (so that the letters seem to flow into each other) but, if you keep
    the same vertical coordinates for all connecting letters, at least they WILL line
    up. If, perchance, you want you terminal strokes to slant (rather than be perpendicular
    to the baseline, as in this example), set the sidebearings to zero, write down
    the numbers for the left-hand connector first, flip the character horizontally,
    match up the numbers, flip again, then adjust the sidebearings (subtract half
    of the horizontal difference between the top and bottom from each side).\r\n\r\nThis
    may not be the best way to do it, but it works for me..."

  body: wow, thanks oldnick. The characters will def. link up on a perpendicular,
    thank s for this mini lesson... everything helps :)
