body: "i'm in the midst of a giant shitstorm (please excuse the expression) here with
  some other people and i need YOUR help.\r\n\r\ni have announced to these people
  that i will not knowingly use/touch ANY \"illegal\" softwares, including fonts.
  in my mind, this was pretty straightforward: there are 2 ways that i'm aware of
  to obtain a given piece of software--either pay for it, or steal it.\r\n\r\nthis
  created the shitstorm, and now we're down to \"what is legal? what is illegal?\",
  so i'm asking you (many different professional type people) for input.\r\n\r\ncan
  you direct me to anything that will explain to me CONCISELY and IN NO UNCERTAIN
  TERMS what precisely is allowed in font usage in the USA? do typographers/type designers
  get to make their own rules/laws? who/what governs this stuff? i was told that \"these
  guys make up these rules and they SOUND like LAW but that doesn't MAKE them LAW.\"\r\n\r\ni
  was told that \"if you go to a type designer's website, you can often set a sample
  word or line using their font(s),\" which is obviously true. \"furthermore, you
  can now outline that type or copy the rasterized result and what you've ended up
  with is NOT their intellectual property\" etc \u2026 what do you think of this?
  or, more precisely, what do you KNOW about this, legally? \r\n\r\none of the people
  i'm arguing with is under the impression that there are ways to legally circumvent
  having to pay for a type font (see outlining suggestion, above). do you know if
  there ARE? not necessarily what's \"right\", but what's LEGAL?\r\n\r\nme: \"what
  would you say if you met one of these type designers face-to-face, knowing that
  you had their goods on your mac and you hadn't paid for them?\"\r\nthe response:
  \"i'd tell 'em straight to their face that i had pirated copies of their fonts and
  now maybe we can work together to create a better situation for everyone involved.
  they'd probably be glad that i was so honest and forthcoming about admitting it.\"\r\nas
  THE TYPE DESIGNER, what WOULD you say to that?\r\n\r\nfinally, i'm having to respond
  to \"if you ask TYPOGRAPHERS about this, of COURSE you're going to get responses
  that agree with your viewpoint.\" \u2026 comments?\r\n\r\nMY viewpoint is simple.
  you either PAY or STEAL. i'm unaware of any other practical options for obtaining
  PAY FONTS.\r\n\r\nif you could take a few minutes from your undoubtedly busy schedules
  and help educate here, i'll be in your debt. i'm fighting for your rights, and because
  i'm ignorant (and do not understand legalese, typically), i'm in a battle that's
  going nowhere fast. i want to present an airtight case (SIMPLY, QUICKLY, and in
  a STRAIGHTFORWARD manner), if possible, proving that one HAS to PAY for a non-free
  typeface if they're going to be using it in any way.\r\n\r\nthanks very much for
  your consideration, and if you choose to respond, i thank you in advance for your
  help. \r\n\r\ni remain anonymous, for obvious reasons. but please know that i am
  trying to do the legal/morally sound/\"right\" thing here.\r\n\r\nfrustrated\r\n"

  body: "Generally, when it comes to all things law, you need to speak with a lawyer.
    This doesn't mean paying for one - perhaps you have friends who are practicing
    lawyers. You should speak with them.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple: law is complicated.
    Anyone who does not have the equivalent of an LL.B. or J.D. simply isn't qualified
    to inform you of legal matters. There's a reason why law is a 4 year degree in
    most jurisdictions. 'Bush lawyers' as some people call them \u2013 that is, people
    who think they know about the law because they've personally been involved in
    a contract dispute, have been to Court, have engaged in personal study of the
    law or have had legal problems themselves \u2013 can only provide you with their
    own experience. Law is double sided. Knowing what is relevant and irrelevant,
    and why something is relevant or irrelevant, takes a University degree. And when
    we're talking about IP law, this is an incredibly detailed area that only a professional
    lawyer can properly assist you with. \r\n\r\nFinally, what is legal and illegal
    is impossible to say unless you can provide us with the actual fact scenario.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> you either PAY or STEAL. i'm unaware of any other practical options for
    obtaining PAY FONTS.\r\nYou can also get commercial fonts that comes bundled with
    software (for example, Photoshop or Illustrator) as the designers where already
    compensated by software companies buying OEM licenses.\r\n\r\nAnd, you can also
    use Libre Fonts, released under the SIL Open Font License. In many cases the designers
    where also compensated in advance. In other cases, the designers released them
    for free without seeking compensation. Also, when a font has the SIL Open Font
    license attached, it makes it 100% legal for anyone to use it for commercial projects
    (as opposed to free fonts whiteout any license attached).\r\nIn many cases, Libre
    fonts used to be \"Pay font\", that have now been re-released under a Libre license
    (for example you can find font by Sudtipos, Type-together, TypeSetIt and many
    other commercial foundries on Google Webfonts)"

  body: "so i'm no lawyer, but from common sense:\r\n\r\nA creates a product from
    his own idea and craftsmanship. He does this to earn a living, get rich or die
    trying. He finishes the product and puts it on the market with his own terms and
    conditions that seem to be appropriate to him (use only if you pay price X, use
    only for your own but don't share, ...).\r\nB looks for a solution for  his problem,
    and finds the product of A. He sees that it would solve his problem, and examines
    the terms and conditions to make use of it. If the conditions are appropriate
    to the problem (price, rights, etc.), B pays for the product and agrees to use
    it within the terms that are part of that contract.\r\nSo for commercial fonts
    this means: if the conditions to use it include that you must have payed for it
    \u2013 that's it, and there's no way around.\r\n\r\nOn the special case to write
    some words in the font on the designers webpage and trace it: the use of commercial
    websites often contain ... terms and conditions, where might be written that you
    can use the word generator for preview purposes, but not use the generated images
    in commercial projects without purchasing the font."

    to be 100% original. Which means A owes something to society, the same society
    that B belongs to.\r\n\r\nThis BTW is why I believe the no-mod clause typical
    of contemporary EULAs is immoral.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
