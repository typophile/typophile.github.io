  body: The customized version of Apple Myriad used on-screen is called Lucida Grande.  If
    you have Lucida Sans, you can also use that since it's almost exactly the same.

  body: "While they both could be called humanist sans, Myriad and Lucida are two
    different typefaces.\r\n\r\nMyriad was designed by a team at Adobe, led by Carol
    Twombly and Robert Slimbach:\r\nhttp://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1706.html\r\n\r\nLucida
    Grande is a display version of Lucida Sans. Both were designed by Kris Bigelow
    and Charles Holmes:\r\nhttp://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1359.html\r\n"

  body: "Well, I meant that while Apple Myriad is used in print, Lucida Grande is
    the font used on screen.  So, the choice depends on your display medium.\r\n\r\nSorry
    if I caused any confusion."
