  href=\"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/124\">Theorem</a></strong> is an interesting change
  from the usual calligraphic work of Koziupa and Paul. An art deco font with a twist
  in its capitals, Theorem's lowercase characters were designed to automatically achieve
  the best optical spacing in typesetting. To accomplish that goal, a variety of alternates
  were drawn for most letters, and plenty of vowel-focused ligatures were designed.
  The auto-magic of OpenType ties it all together to a make a very versatile typeface
  that is quite useful for packaging and many different applications of display typography.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    lowercase <strong>f</strong>! :-)
