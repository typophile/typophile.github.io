    not a cube.\r\nHaving said that i do quite like what you have done.\r\nTo my eyes
    the c and u work best with the internal and external squares.\r\nThe b and e could
    probably benifit from a bit of tweaking.\r\nHave you considered making the whole
    thing as a 3d object with the letter squares being a seperate cube - kind of like
    a typographers childs letterblock?\r\n\r\nWill"

    know that I have made a square, but these are similar shapes, the difference is
    in dimension (2D vs 3D)\r\n\r\nBut still I will try making 3D letters\r\n"

      if it is okay, may I please use the logo above?\r\nI really love the design
      and before I use it, I thought that it would be better to get your permission....\r\nMay
      I?"
