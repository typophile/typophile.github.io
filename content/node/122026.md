body: "I'm designing a huge, multi-script sans serif family with true italic. At the
  moment I've almost finished the regular and started the italic. The thin and black
  masters are also at the very beginning. The question is\u2014should I release and
  start selling regular and italic and later add other weights later (this is better
  for me) or wait and release the whole family (this, I think, would be more fair
  for customers).\r\n\r\nWhat would you do? I've seen both release models on MyFonts
  and I'm not sure which one to choose."

  body: If you prefer a delayed release, as a start I would suggest you offer at least
    a basic family (two styles, two weights).

  body: For me, and I suspect most type designers, the experience of designing the
    additional weights will help you uncover bugs and issues in the original regular
    and italic, which will have previously escaped your notice. So waiting to finish
    the family will lead to a higher-quality initial release.

  body: "Once you release part of the typeface, it pretty much locks you into the
    design. Six months from now, as you're working on the other weights, you'll be
    kicking yourself for not having made the bowls rounder or the corners sharper
    or the descenders shorter or whatever -- only it'll be too late to change it.\r\n\r\nThen
    again, putting what you have out there now will give you some insight into whether
    or not it's worth the effort to create all those additional variations in the
    family."

    variations in the family</blockquote>\r\nNot necessarily. I can imagine a lot
    of typefaces aren't purchased simply because they lack weights and styles. For
    example, unless it's for display use I have no use for a typeface that only consists
    of Regular and Italic. I've never purchased a non-display typeface that lacks
    a bold weight. I can imagine the more fonts the typeface features, the higher
    the potential that it will sell.\r\n\r\nI'm actually in a similar situation. I
    designed two typefaces of 3 weights each. I have the design for the italics ready
    but haven't turned those into fonts yet except for Light Italic, which is not
    done yet. I currently have other things to work on so it may take some months
    before the italics are added. Both typefaces are related though, so finishing
    the italics for one of them means most of the work is done for the other as well.\r\n\r\nAdded
    to the situation is the fact that one of these typefaces was for a client and
    he has exclusivity on it for a year. I haven't been payed for the exclusivity
    agreement though (at the time I thought it was standard that the client who pays
    for the design has exclusivity for a while, or he would be spending a lot of money
    on a design that is going to be available to others for little money) and no contract
    was made for such an agreement, but I don't want to be unethical so I'm sticking
    to the agreement. But this does mean that if I would like to release both typefaces
    together\u2014which seems to be the best choice\u2014I will have to wait one more
    year. This gives me the time to finish the italics, but I don't like the fact
    that three of my fonts are just catching dust. Six fonts if you consider that
    there is no official agreement on the exclusivity deal."

  body: Agreed that the number of styles is part of the versatility of the typeface,
    and that people will choose (or not choose) typefaces based in part on this. Most
    especially for text faces.

  body: "Hmmm, I didn't notice that only the regular and italics were finished.  I
    guess that I just assumed there would be at least a regular, bold and italics
    of each. So no, I wouldn't release anything that might pass as a text face without
    the bold weights. A display face, maybe, but it would depend.\r\n\r\nAs for the
    heavy, light, thin, medium, demi, condensed, expanded or whatever, I don't think
    it's as important to release them all at once. It's true that purchase decisions
    are often made on how many variants are in the family (at least I do). Even if
    \ buying only the bold and italic, I'll want to know that more flexibility is
    an option if needed down the road.\r\n\r\nThat said, assuming regular, bold and
    both italic weights are available, and if a bigger family isn't in the offing
    for a year or so, I'm not sure it's as big of a concern. Sure, a few sales would
    be lost by releasing only a partial family, but they'd also be lost by holding
    off.\r\n\r\nI'm making a similar decision myself, I'm just finishing up the four
    base fonts in a family, but plan on building both heavy and light versions. With
    close to 800 glyphs in each, the thought of waiting versus seeing some sort of
    return on all the work is a tough one. I seem to be learning more toward holding
    off, though \u2014 for all the reasons mentioned in my previous post."
