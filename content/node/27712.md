  body: I can't see anything. It would also be nice if you could be more specific
    with the title of your thread, if you read down you will see just how many threads
    have variations on this...

  body: "The bold weight of Flareserif 821 is closer, but it still isn't heavy enough.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.hp.com/\">Hewlett-Packard</a> used to ship an Albertus Extra
    Bold with their LaserJet printers (maybe they still do). I have still have a copy
    of this font, and it looks like an exact match to me.\r\n\r\nA newer laser printer
    of mine, a <a href=\"http://www.brother.com/\">Brother</a>, came with something
    called Alaska Extrabold that also looks like a match."

    cigar."
