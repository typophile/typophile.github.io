  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all, 
This is my first post. I have been a silent viewer for a while now. 
I've written [[http://alecjacobson.com/programs/font/java|an applet]] that allows the user to compare any two fonts on her machine. The applet let's the user fine tune sizes and location allowing for a close-up and detailed font comparison. It's a java applet that runs in the browser (as long as you have java enabled):

Let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions for improvements!
Thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Really cool idea and great execution.

The only thing I'm questioning is the sole ability to compare fonts on one's own machine. Should there be a way to compare fonts that one doesn't have/own the rights to? Though I'm not sure how that would happen without necessitating a rather hefty online database. 

Anyway, like I said, great job so far. And I appreciate the ability to freely move around the two specimens. You may also think about incorporating some form of guide system, so the user can align the two fonts more easily.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah. I totally wish that I could include fonts the user doesn't have/own the rights to. 
I will look into the possibility of hosting all of my existing fonts (I have quite a few) and then having an option to load (my) external fonts. 

Guide system is a great idea. I will certainly throw some graph paper in the background, at least. Do you think "snapping" like Adobe products would be worthwhile as an option? Or just an annoyance?</div>

I added three new features: if you type <em>grid</em> that will toggle a graph paper background, <em>switch</em> will switch the two fonts (so you drag the other one, just in case that feels better) and <em>random</em> just for fun, will select to fonts at random. Let me know if these features are dumb/too hard to use etc. Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If possible I think there should be a type field to change the text. Also scaling should be made more intuitive through a pull down menu as opposed to pushing the left or right arrows. Also, the switch/grid functions should probably be check boxes rather than typed commands. Also, when I type switch, I still can only move the red one.

I like the grid system you have there—it makes it really easy to line them up

Good work so far :)

		<div class="commentbody">That looks cool enough to be implemented into existing Font Managers, or even in a program like InDesign! When I have to combine any two fonts into one document, I always have a go at getting their optical sizes right -- not just the "point size".

But I'm finding my old IE keeps the focus on one of the drop down lists, so I can't use the arrows without selecting another font at the same time ?:(
(Don't worry -- I'll try tomorrow on an up-to-date IE.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Many thanks again for the suggestions and compliments. I have a much changed (an hopefully much improved) version up now, still at [[http://alecjacobson.com/programs/font/java/]]. The old version is still available for comparison's sake, now at  [[http://alecjacobson.com/programs/font/java/old]]. I implemented some sliders for the sizes, handles for dragging both fonts,  a text field (with the option of inputting the old way because I was used to that and why not), and some buttons.

Still haven't found a way to easily host fonts users might not have locally. 

Anyway, enjoy and keep the suggestions and comments coming.</div>

But the size bars are a bit small ... It must be the long font names in my system:

And apparently, the Windows version doesn't see OpenType fonts, just TTFs, but I'm fully prepared to blaim the Java implementation for that (I'm using Sun's own, also the latest).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Theunis de Jong, Thanks for uploading the screenshot. I don't have access to PC right now, so it helps a lot to see how this is showing up on other browsers.

I have included info boxes (which can be toggled to show pt size or %) and I put the sliders on their own row (does this look better on IE?). Hopefully things aren't getting too crowded.

I'm not sure what's up with the OpenType fonts not showing up. I will look into it, but it might take a while before I can work on a windows machine.

		<div class="commentbody">This might be a minor thing, but I would suggest some way of changing the default colors.  It doesn't bother me personally, but I'm sure there may be someone out there that might be jarred by it.  Maybe a small dropdown next to each list where they can change the colors?

On a related note, for the same reason as above, I suggest that the font colors should not be within the fontlists.  The blue especially might make it hard for some people to read the titles (as the font names are coming in black).

Other than that, great job!</div>
