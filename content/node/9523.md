    &#34;buy some real graphics software&#34;, I have Corel PhotoPaint 10 on this
    system, and could&#39;ve used that, but ImageMagick is more convenient for batch
    conversions, especially when your screen shot tool saves to a non-GIF format by
    default.  Ah well.  I&#39;ll remember this next time!&#41;'

    <BR> <BR>Anyway, your second image seems to be 597 bytes, so it&#39;s comparable
    to what I got - but [obviously] PNG is not as well supported... GIF roolz, baby.
    Except if you need a lossless 8-bit alpha channel - a very rare requirement. <BR>
