    Properties... - Fonts\" in Adobe Reader, you get a list of all the fonts embedded
    in a PDF document. \r\n\r\nIn this case, it's Frutiger and Rage Italic."

    opening the acrobat in Adobe Reader and pressing cmd-D. \r\nA window showing the
    document properties will show up, including the contained fonts."
