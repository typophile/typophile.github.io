  body: In a general sense, you could define irony as the incongruity between expectations
    and outcomes, specifically when the outcome reflects the incongruity in a painful
    or poignant way. When one's actions achieve the opposite of one's intentions,
    the incongruity is unavoidable. You feel like the forces of nature have conspired
    against you.
