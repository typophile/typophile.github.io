  something more decorative than Davka\u2019s Gonen (in the attached image or at [[http://www.davka.com/Images/hfg/gon.jpg]]).
  \ Is there anything that would match well with (say) Zapfino?\r\n\r\n++J"

    25]].\r\n\r\nMatching Hebrew and Roman fonts is always difficult. It may be that
    a font with the 'crowns' on the letters will better match a roman script font,
    because of the high contrast. \r\n\r\nThe best thing is probably to get a calligrapher
    with Hebrew expertise to do the invitation, and he or she will be able to match
    the Hebrew and English. I am talking about the calligrapher doing a model to photograph
    and print from, of course, not the addressing the envelopes etc.  \r\n\r\nThere
    are a number of fine calligraphers who do this kind of thing--Hebrew and English--in
    the New York area, where you are. They also do Ketubbot, etc.  "

    These are specific to STA'M (Sifrei Torah, Tefillin and Mezuzot) lettering, so
    I'm not sure how appropriate they would be for other use, even if the wedding
    is taking place in a religious context."

  body: "Yes, I was referring to tagin. I think I remember 'stam' fonts being used
    on invitations, but they may have been Bar or Bat Mitzvah invitations. Because
    the Bar Mitzvah ceremony involves the first reading from the Torah for the child,
    it might be more appropriate there. I don't know of any prohibition on using this
    style, though.\r\n\r\nOverall, a copperplate latin script I think would be particularly
    hard to match, because Hebrew cursive script is not connected, and the normal
    square writing shapes are very different. I would think that a calligraphic roman,
    like Brioso or Diotima, would be easier to match with a calligraphic Hebrew. \r\n\r\nBut
    overall, it is very hard because Hebrew has thin verticals and thick horizontals,
    and Roman the opposite.  If the invitation is done by a calligrapher he or she
    can keep the pen at a similar angle for both, and make them work together. \r\n\r\nI
    put together David and Friz Quadrata on a project, and they worked as the low
    contrast made the differences in stress stand out less. But they wouldn't work
    on an invitation..."

    across alphabets.\u2002Fortunately I don\u2019t need to mix them on the same page

    level of \u201Cswash-ness\u201D.\u2002OTOH, Zapfino is rather excessive in that
    regard, so I might be setting the bar too high\u2026.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking
    for formal and decorative\u2014the same situation that makes a swash script appropriate
