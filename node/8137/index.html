  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So I was recently talking to my typographer friend Ike about what I believe to be some severe deficiencies in the way that OS X handles font rendering. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I'm no typographer, but I do a lot of software and web development, using my powerbook, a windows computer, and linux. So, it seems to go without saying that I'm not concerned with fonts in print or at large sizes, as much as I am with having clear, legible, type that's easy on the eyes and lets me get my work done. <BR> <BR>Now, that said, I should begin by noting that from a legibility standpoint, I've yet to experience a font rendering system or set of default fonts that are better than those provided with Microsoft Windows. (not ClearType, mind you, but the default non-antialiased (at small sizes, anyway) font rendering). Suffice to say I've been happy with developing under Windows (from a font perspective, at least)  <BR> <BR>Mac OS X, however, is a different story all together. I've noticed some serious deficiencies in the way that OSX renders fonts. I suppose that there are three things about it that really get under my skin: <BR> <BR>1) Fonts render too light: Take for example the premier text editors on both the Mac and Windows platforms, BBEdit and EditPad Pro (Because both of these pieces of software use the default system font rendering algorithms, we're not comparing the programs here, but the underlying operating system font rendering). The following two screenshots illustrate the default configurations of both BBEdit and EditPad Pro <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/55756.jpg" alt=" BBEdit on Mac OS X&#44; Fonts too light.">  <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/55757.png" alt="EditPad Pro on Microsoft Windows&#44; Legible and easy on the eyes."> . Now, admittedly, the fonts in the OSX screenshot are antialiased, while they aren't in the Windows screenshot, but that aside, I find the windows fonts to be infinitely more legible and usable than those in OS X.  <BR> <BR>2) Font kerning problems: This problem REALLY confuses me. Partly because of the lack of quality control on Apple's end, but also because I haven't heard people complain about this in the past. Take for example <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/55758.jpg" alt="Horrible kerning issues under Mac OS X"> this screenshot. Taken in Safari, Courier New, 14pt (blue and underlined because it's a link). Being a monospaced font, I would expect the space between the first square bracket and the 't' to be the same as the space between the 'p' and the closing bracket. Also, the underline extends beyond the closing bracket, and there is no space between the underline and the text. <BR> <BR>So, are these &quot;bugs&quot; or are they &quot;features&quot;? What does everyone think about this? Are Mac OS X fonts pretty but unusable? Are they ugly? Are non-antialiased fonts better at screen resolutions (72dpi) for programming/scripting than anti-aliased ones? Is this a problem with the fonts themselves or the implementation of the renderer?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Try using Courier instead of Courier New as your default font in BBEdit. Courier New is much lighter than Courier and this results in it looking quite light in OSX text rendering.  <BR> <BR>You might also try using my free <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html" target="_blank">Anonymous</a> font. At 9 and 10 points it renders without anti-aliasing in BBEdit on OSX, and, since it is large for its size, 9 and 10 point are closer in size to 11 and 12 point Courier.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Note also that BBEdit has an option in the preferences to turn of anti-aliasing at up to 12 point (see the &quot;Editing: General&quot; panel in the BBEdit Preferences). I don't know if EditingPad Pro has a similar option, but you can also make this change system-wide in the Appearance panel of the System Preferences. <BR> <BR>For what it's worth, Courier is the default OSX monospaced font and comes from Apple. Courier New is an optional font which usually comes from Microsoft and was probably installed when you installed a Microsoft app for cross-platform document compatibility with Windows which doesn't have Courier (without the &quot;New&quot;).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not going to argue that OS X does a nice job of font rendering, and you certainly point out some particularly weird things. But among those there are a couple of points that need clarification/correction. <BR> <BR>There are two definitions of &quot;kerning,&quot; neither of which is applicable here. Monospaced fonts generally don't have (either kind of) kerning, and certainly Courier doesn't, regardless of version. I'm pretty sure what you mean is spacing, not kerning. <BR> <BR>&quot;and there is no space between the underline and the text.&quot; <BR> <BR>Generally, the underline is below the baseline, but above the descender line. That's the case here. Yes, it cuts across the descender on the &quot;p.&quot; Sad. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No argument there, that the OS X rasterizer could improve. As I understand it, Apple has been making an ongoing effort to improve their font rendering - as in, it has already changed at least once within the OS X era - and I expect that to continue. <BR> <BR>Certainly choosing a font that works as well as possible with the current rendering tech will help, but if you really don't like the current rendering, you may be pretty limited in how much you can improve things through font selection. <BR> <BR>Of course, as noted elsewhere in this thread, you can also set the size at which anti-aliasing kicks in on OS X, which may help. <BR> <BR>I must admit that the advent of OS X made me particularly glad that Adobe's own applications generally use their own rendering system, independent of the OS. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>
