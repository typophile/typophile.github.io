  this number comes from the cover of a 1970 rock opera whose title is inspired by
  the famous song \" Revolution 9 \" by the Beatles .\r\nSometimes we're are looking
  even for numbers and I'm looking for this for almost thirteen years. I have always
  adapted the \"Gloucester MT Extra Condensed\", but as you can see there are clear
  differences and now is the time to find out (finally) that font is .\r\nTo the left
  of the original and on the right the aforementioned \"Gloucester MT Extra Condensed\".\r\nCan
  you help me, please?\r\nThanks 9 times. ;-)"

    Numbering]] Serif is the closest I could get, possibly closer than Gloucester
    Extra Condensed.

    the other typefaces on the cover\u2014which you probably already know\u2014are
    Gill Sans Ultra Bold (composer), Desdemona/Quaint Gothic (Orpheo), and the 9 is
    from neither typeface.\r\n\r\nWindsor Elongated was the closest match I could
    find, but it's only close\u2014the bottom terminal doesn't match:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/windsor/ "

  body: "Ryuk@ Mmhh... look as the original hole is a perfect oval. Not the same as
    the one in Crash Numbering.\r\n\r\nkthomps5@ You got it! But wasn't so hard. \"Orfeo9\"
    with \"f\".\r\nI've turned off and closed my Macbook in the bag (I'm coming home),
    inside of it I have a list of all (or almost) the fonts used in any cover of the
    reprints, very interesting.\r\nBy the way I used Dustine Solid in place of Desdemona/Quaint
    Gothic because it's free! :-)\r\nWindsor Elongated? No way. The terminal hook
    is very different."

  body: "iFab, the terminal hook is also very different on Gloucester--and so is the
    shape of its counter.\r\n\r\nWith two small edits (at the bottom of the bowl and
    at the terminal), Windsor Elongated would do nicely.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Windsor_6440.png]"

    art director for the cover of _Orfeo9_ was Edoardo Sivelli. See http://www.inkroci.com/culture_movie/reviews/those-amazing-records/tito-schipa,-jr-orfeo-9.html
    \r\nHe would know the source of the _9_. \r\nYou could ask him. Hopefully he is
    still alive. \r\nA google search turns up several people with this name. \r\nPerhaps
    this is the one https://www.facebook.com/edoardo.sivelli and https://www.xing.com/profile/Edoardo_Sivelli\r\nDon"
