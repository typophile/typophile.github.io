body: "with this being my #1 type resource, i wanted to post this as i prepare to
  move to a smaller apartment.  unfortunately i can't keep everything due to the space,
  so i'm selling (or trading) some of my design and culture volumes. \r\n\r\nall titles
  are listed at http://www.mlproject.com/books and will be added to throughout the
  next few weeks.  prices include US shipping and if you want more than one thing,
  i will be flexible on price.  i will also trade these for back issues of IDEA, EYE
  or BASELINE that i do not have.\r\n\r\naside from this, i have had zero luck in
  locating idea back issues aside from the past few years.  if anyone has any, i am
  definitely interested in purchasing collections."
