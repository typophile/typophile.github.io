  body: "Hmmm...the letterforms match (except for the D, which has no gap at the bottom
    of the vertical stroke), but there doesn't seem to be a published version of Blippo
    with a weight this light, at least not from the usual sources.\r\n\r\nDo you know
    of one, Tamas?\r\n\r\n-NJ"

  body: "the font is Blippo Bold, I created this font in 1965 for Facsimile Fonts
    and FotoStar International. Blippo Black has been copied by at least 6 font sellers.
    Most of them without license. URW++ is the biggest offender. There are 12  weight
    and versions.\r\nRobert Trogman"
