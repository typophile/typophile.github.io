body: "Hi all, I'm new to this forum and am hoping for some advice, as fonts are not
  my strong-suit. I need to choose a font to represent a company producing products
  for little kids (2-6) - it will be used for the logo and product names too. Think
  fun & crafty.\r\n\r\nMy favorite is Prater - http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_prater_ot/\r\n\r\nIt
  seems playful, and the different formats would be useful for different applications
  as the company grows.\r\n\r\nOther contenders were Handsome, Bello, and Klepto,
  but they didn't seem as flexible. What do you guys think about using Prater? Or
  any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nBelle."

    that it's maybe more suitable for slightly older kids...\r\n"

  body: Thanks Riccard0 thats an interesting thought - do you mean because it looks
    more fun than "cute"? Handsome is more "pretty" but I thought it was a little
    too "baby"....

  body: I was thinking of something softer and/or rounder (than Prater).
