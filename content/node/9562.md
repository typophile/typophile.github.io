body: This is designed for a woman&#39;s clothing line that is known for her billowy
  beaded tops but also wants to venture into a more aggressive line, so I need to
  make sure that this logo will not only hold up for a while but feel feminine yet
  can hold up during a goth or punk phase. <BR> <BR>My main concern is that I can&#39;t
  seem to find the right typeface for the last name Stensson. Right now I am using
  Scala but want something that has more of an edge but is still feels classic enough
  to create contrast between the first name and second. Any suggestions of anykind
  will be of help! I am still trying to tweek the Lotta as well, but feel that the
  Stensson part needs more immediate attention.  <BR> <BR>Please let me know what
  you are getting from this. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66559.jpg"

  body: It is very visually appealing, however it does lead to some difficulties.
    <BR> <BR>I think the A in lotta is somewhat hard to read. It seems more of an
    e or complex o.   <BR> <BR>As for the stensson, I like the idea of a small simple
    font. Try experimenting with various sans-serif fonts and see if that helps. It
    also seems that it should be a bit to the right, as there is a space between the
    n of stensson and the a of lotta that looks like it should have something.

  body: I like the logo. If the &#34;A&#34; is hard to read, maybe rotating the crossbar
    alittle clockwise would solve that. For the last name, have you tried Trajan?
    The upper case &#34;E&#34; has a devious attitude about it.  <BR> <BR>Good job!
    Nice mark.

  body: Perhaps Mason sans might work if yu don&#39;t use the ievrtky decorated letters,
    but rather some of the alternates.

  body: Logo is very beautiful. I think the sharpness is a bit too much for women.
    It lacks sensuality. A is clever but not an easy read.

  body: is it just me or should the stensson move a bit over to the right? I like
    the lotta, even the a, but it&#39;ll need lots of white space around it.
