  body: Squirrel is a great name for it. It really says Squirrel to me.   <BR>  <BR>As
    for the design, I rather like it for it&#39;s utilitarian qualities. I could find
    a use for it.   <BR>It reminds me of the paper clip.  Which I also really like.
    It&#39;s a beautiful thing if you think about it. So well designed you hardly
    stop to think about it. But, when you do, you just have to say <i>wow</i>.  <BR>  <BR>But
    I digress.  <BR>  <BR>The UC &#42;Y&#42; throws me off a bit but I see how you
    got there. Same thing with the &#42;?&#42;. In the latter case I would like to
    see more space in the bowl. But again, I see what you are after - its in the style
    of the design.  <BR>  <BR>Nice face, Very pleasant.  <BR>  <BR>smc

  body: 'the turbo-heightened x-height creates some great and unique forms. looks
    great to me, the only thing which remotely causes me to doubt is the closeness
    of the dots on the lc i&#39;s. i&#39;d not raise them, perhaps shorten the bottom
    a smidgeon to define the separation more. <BR> <BR>curious:  on a typography site,
    is one&#39;s credibility compromised in critique comments where smart quotes and
    apostrophes are not applied?'
