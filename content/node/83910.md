  environmental objectives. They are branching out to include web media services.\r\n\r\nThe
  idea behind logo1 and logo3 is for the leaves to show the recycling around the globe
  (to show digital communications). we have been unsure about if this is too much
  and so tried to simply add a leaf into the r on logo2\r\n\r\nany feedback would
  be amazing..\r\n"

  body: 'I didn''t see #2 as a leaf, and the others feel too generic in their treatment
    of such a common symbol as a leaf.  I get the recycling/leaf idea, but I would
    brainstorm some more concepts.  Maybe something speaking to the kind of media
    they are involved in.  Especially with the name being so vague, you might want
    to really focus on communicating that essence of who they are.'

  body: "Regarding #1 and #3: that's a charged symbol in a bunch of contexts, see
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM#Symbols\">BDSM emblem</a> and generally
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion\">Triskelion</a>. I'm not saying
    avoid generally, but be aware of how much this might be reminiscent of.\r\nTo
    be honest in #1 I didn't see leaves, but some sort of a propeller or something.
    I'm not sure it needs this rotating motion; \xABleaf\xBB already says \xABenvironmental\xBB,
    to include recycling on top of that seems redundant (and potentially mismatched
    imagery). \r\nI most like the idea behind #2, although I agree it needs some work
    still to clearly read as a leaf."
