  a place to submit a jpg and it could be ID'd by computer, but I can't find that
  link anymore, so here here goes...:-)\r\nI need the text int  he circle ID'd, if
  anyone can help, that'd be just spiffy."

    or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/">What the Font</a> or something
    like that. This site ID's fonts by means of human beings looking at them and just
    knowing what they are by intuition. ;-)
