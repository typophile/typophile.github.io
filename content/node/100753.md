  body: "Karen, good point. Although most people simply post in the wrong section
    (and it's good to advise them to also post in the correct section), since the
    crowd in the ID section is so different from the crowd in the rest of Typophile
    it's conceivable that somebody might post outside the ID section (or both inside
    and outside) to get a different kind of response.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    'Build', 'Release', 'Type ID Board', or 'Critique' sub-forums, and yet still related
    to Type\".\r\n\r\nSee also <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/100831\">I am new
