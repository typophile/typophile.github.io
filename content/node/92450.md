body: "Typophiliacs,\r\n\r\nThe Biome superfamily has grown. I've managed to finish
  all the work on the full, originally-planned suite:  Biome Narrow, Normal and Wide
  will be re-released in all 42 styles (7 weights plus italics, in all 3 widths) in
  early June. \r\n\r\nCaveat: This release will see Biome taken under the wing of
  the Monotype/ITC label, so will become a product they handle. I've chosen to simplify
  things by taking the original Wide fonts off the market. The new ones are slightly
  improved, but there is a big difference:\r\n\r\nThe new fonts have a more conventional
  character set, and DO NOT include all the wacky alternate forms. It would have been
  more overwhelming than it already was, to consider including all those options and
  building out OT features for all 42 styles. The more conventional set was chosen
  as defaults, because it seems the range of possible uses grows even larger with
  this modification. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for a few more weeks, the original Wides are
  still available. If those display alternates seem valuable, grab them now, before
  they go away. Maybe someday, if Biome is successful, I can consider producing all
  those alternates.\r\n\r\nThe new Wides won't have the alternates, but all the upcoming
  styles are fully-featured pro fonts, with small caps, various figure styles and
  ligatures. \r\n\r\nEverything will be available on Monotype's many, many outlets!
  ;)   For the first time since Makambo days, my work will be available on MyFonts....
  \r\n\r\nI'm so relieved this project is nearly complete! Now to see about a nifty
  Biome gift item to celebrate.... Ideas? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/biomesplash03_5540.gif]"

  body: "Congrats Carl! I think it's the most convincing typeface in this genre -
    quite nice to look at. And I'm glad this one only took <em>six</em> years.  ;-)\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I just found that awesome ILT piece on the development*. It's cool that Frutiger's
    pebble letters (is that what he called them?) actually served as usable inspiration
    to somebody. And I hope you can splice the funky stuff back in one day.\r\n\r\n*

    item? Pillows. But not like the House stuff, I mean shaped like the actual letters,
    from the Ultra weight.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "OK,\r\n\r\nThe swap is complete. I don't see products at MyFonts yet, but
    other outlets have the whole schmeer. Linotype has a special freebie if you sign
    up for their newsletter. \r\n\r\nI also discovered that you can try out a few
    of the styles in the Fonts.com Web Fonts preview tool. Try it on a site that is
    normally very staid, or one that is normally decorative and frilly. This tool
    is fun and helpful at the same time. \r\n\r\nHrant, your idea of pillows is excellent
    and perfect! I wish that ovoid shape were something easily sourced. I like the
    idea of a series of colorful blob letters as pillows on a sofa. "

    Is it worse, or better than a body pillow with a face on it? I did find a medical
    supply company with an oval pillow. They imprint it with liver and stomach diagrams..... '
