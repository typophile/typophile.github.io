  poster project about type and the characteristics of it, I was thinking of having
  a school of type, where for instance, Helvetica would be the cool kid and Comic
  Sans would be the kid nobody liked.\r\n\r\nThats the basic idea, but what I was
  looking for, is what you guys think about typefaces and the reputation that suceeds
  them.  A few questions...\r\n\r\nIs there a gay typeface?\r\nIs there a typeface
  that would win Miss World?\r\nMaybe the worlds strongest man?\r\nWhat is the slag
  of all typefaces?\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your comments, as I am aware
  that you are all much more experienced than me in this field...\r\n\r\nThanks guys,\r\n\r\nTom\r\nGraphic
  Design student"

    grades, but not enough to be on the honour roll. He's got a lot of friends, but
    he's nobody's BEST friend.\r\n\r\nThe cool kid might be Gotham or Neutraface right
    now, although who knows who will be cool tomorrow.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    Fonts. \r\n\r\nThe Gay Type: United from House Industries. See, Fox sports uses
    it, and trust me (I'm queer as a three-dollar bill) football is overflowing with
    gay guys, so use United.\r\n\r\nThe Miss World Face: The new Luxury family from
    House wins again. If you can't get that one, just use Mrs. Eaves\r\n\r\nThe World's
    Strongest: Akzidenz-Grotesk super wins here. \r\n\r\nThe Slag of all typefaces:
    Arial. \r\n\r\nAs for Helvetica... man, you're a design student. Use cool fonts
    now so that when you get stuck using Helvetica later you haven't already gotten
    sick of seeing it. Hell, unless you can do it at 200 picas or bigger, just don't
    use Helvetica at all."

    else? I think the poster would have a very different feel if you were going for
    the UK instead of the US. from my observations in Dagenham Comic Sans and Gill
    would be the popular kids, in the US it would be other faces, maybe Franklin Gothic
    and Myriad. \r\n"

  body: "Din is the kid who's editor of the yearbook, valedictorian, star of the school
    play, and everybody tries to be just like him.\r\n\r\nComic sans is the kid who
    thinks he's funny but people are laughing at him, not with him.\r\n\r\nTimes Roman
    is the kid who does all the grunt work to please the teacher. You can't get rid
    of him.\r\n\r\nArial is the kid your mom makes you invite to your birthday party
    because you invited the rest of your class but nobody talks to him - he sits in
    the corner picking his nose and licking the frosting off the bottoms of the candles\r\n\r\nEclat
    is popular (at least on this site) as are the House Industries kids\r\n\r\nGotham
    - everybody likes gotham, nice to the dweebs as well as the cool kids\r\n\r\nPapyrus
    is the faux intellectual nobody listens to when he raises his hand in class\r\n\r\nMrs.
    Eaves is lovely and mysterious but kind of hard to get along with\r\n\r\nMyriad
    is really really boring but gets good grades. Hangs out with Verdana\r\n\r\nAvant
    Garde seems boring at first but has his own sense of style\r\n\r\nDax tries too
    hard to be cool\r\n\r\nGill isn't as interesting as he seems\r\n\r\nMatrix is
    the kid who was cool a few years ago and thinks he still is... but the joke's
    on him\r\n"
