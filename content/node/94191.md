  body: "That's correct Rainer, \r\nI was stupid enough to not understand that \"body
    copy\" was just a marker for the rest of text ;)\r\nLOL\r\n\r\nI agree with Ryuk
    that the actual body-text looks like Flama (maybe Flama Book)."

  body: And to be more precise about the logotype, it's actually a [[http://klim.co.nz/lettering-and-logotypes/|custom
    job]] by Kris Sowersby.

  body: Logotype is most probably [[http://www.behance.net/ineodesignlab/frame/3360895|custom]].
    The body copy looks more like [[http://vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama|Flama]] to me.
