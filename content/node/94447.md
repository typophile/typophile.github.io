  this font. I have not seen a font with the particular curling style of the V, and
  the end of letters in B and D. \r\n\r\nThank you for your help."

    are many differences, particularly on the vowels are there any other fonts like
    this?\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SQUIRE_5491.png]"

  body: "Hi Riccard0\r\n\r\nYes this is probably the case, unfortunately for me the
    organisation is now defunct and has been superseded many times and those newer
    orgs. haven't kept any info on the logo or font.\r\n\r\nHow could I find out about
    the history of the font?"
