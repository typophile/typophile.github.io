  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I was hoping I could get a bit of advice from you clever people about the choice of typeface for a book I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>The text, a rather unconventional &ldquo;autobiography&rdquo; composed of prose pieces of varying lengths along with some poems, seems to me to need a light serif face, rounded rather than spiky, not too condensed, attractive but not &ldquo;showy&rdquo;. One typeface that immediately suggested itself was <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-souvenir/">Souvenir</a>: I don&rsquo;t actually think much of it as a face, but like the overall look it gives to a page.</p>
<p>If I had to choose from what we already have, it would probably be between <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/trump+mediaeval/fonts/">Trump Mediaeval</a>, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/perpetua/fonts/">Perpetua</a> and <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bell-mt/">Bell</a>. None of them is quite right (respectively: too sharp, too small and too irregular-looking), and the versions we have (Bitstream for the first two, plus a Bell that came with the machine) aren&rsquo;t really up to scratch.</p>
<p>My boss isn&rsquo;t too keen on faces that have sharp and/or over-detailed serifs, so that&rsquo;s another limitation.</p>
<p>The book will be four-colour throughout, with plenty of photographs (colour and black and white) mixed in with the text. The paper will therefore be coated and around 120gsm (sorry, I don&rsquo;t know what this is equivalent to in non-metric paper weight). We need the paper to be high-white for the photographs, which isn&rsquo;t ideal for the text, so we&rsquo;re looking into the feasibility of putting a very light creamy tint behind the text and blank parts of the page.</p>
<p>Size-wise, we&rsquo;re thinking 10 to 11 pt (depending on the x-height of the face) on 14pt, but might need to go higher on the leading.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to break the bank on this, but obviously for a book of this magnitude a couple of hundred pounds/dollars/euros will be a drop in the ocean. I&rsquo;m keen to use something new rather than a revival, but would also like to be able to use it for other books in the future.</p>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s enough information to get you going!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Not light, in that sense, but Dolly by Underware is very warm — more like the opposite of spiky. It&rsquo;s shapes are brushlike and flowing, but it&rsquo;s still a sturdy text typeface. Feijoa by Kris Sowersby might fit your bill?</div>

It has a very balanced color on a page.
It comes with Roman, Bold, Italic and Smallcaps, and is quite affordable.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dolly will create a color on the page reminiscent of Souvenir (which you mentioned). It&rsquo;s weight and low contrast will hold up well on coated stock (although it might feel a little out of place in that environment, since it feels more natural on a warm, uncoated stock). But Dolly is not &ldquo;light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As another alternative for consideration, I might somewhat immodestly suggest [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman|Whitman]]. It is light, somewhat rounded in feeling, and not too fancy.</p>
<p>Whitman shares some characteristics with Trump Mediaeval, but is not as angular or oldstyle in its forms. It has some of the simplicity of Perpetua, but sets a bit larger (not as large as Trump), is not as quirky, and is not nearly as brittle in contrast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s moderate contrast keeps it from becoming brittle on coated stock. If the color is a bit too light, then the recently released Semibold is just a tad darker and a suitable alternative for text when a slightly richer color is desired.</p>
<p>You can judge its performance in a variety of sample text settings in several sizes &amp; leadings in my original PDF, downloadable from: <a href="http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmanOverview.html">www.kentlew.com/WhitmanOverview.html</a> (not updated with latest weights, however).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Many thanks for these suggestions. No final decisions have been made yet, but I&rsquo;ve gone as far as to buy Feijoa (very nice indeed), which looks as if it will suit another book design even if we don&rsquo;t end up using it for the one I originally described.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to have an excuse to buy Dolly! I&rsquo;ve been eyeing that one up for ages. As for Whitman - new to me, but very much to my taste. It reminds me a little of both Joanna and Scala, but I suspect it would work much better as an &ldquo;uncontentious&rdquo; text face than either of them. I&rsquo;m particularly pleased that it has a proper semi-bold weight. It&rsquo;s a little pricey, given the current dollar/sterling exchange rate, but if we ever do a comprehensive redesign of our standard house style, then I think it&rsquo;ll will be very high on my list of possible faces.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t the cheapness of it excuse enough? ;) 
A 1 user license is only 150 EUR (133 GBP). 
And you get a very usable bookface for that.</p>

<p>That was, in fact, precisely the intention &amp; impetus behind the design. I&rsquo;m glad you like it.</p>
<p><cite> &gt; It’s a little pricey, given the current dollar/sterling exchange rate, </cite></p>
<p>Even with the dollar as weak as it is? You do realize that Font Bureau has quantity discounts built in to their pricing? For a single-user license, the per-font cost drops from $40 to $35 with four fonts, and again down to $30 for six or more. (This applies regardless of family or style, BTW). (Also, note that the Whitman styles are delivered with both the LF and OsF versions for a single license.)</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really compare Whitman to what you paid for Feijoa, since the latter is fully-featured OpenType with pretty extensive character sets. But comparing with the Dolly quote above, you can get the equivalent four styles of Whitman for $140 USD (£92,50 GBP).</p>
<p>Anyway, enough with the hard sell ;-) If you should ever wish to explore further, and if a PDF sample of some of your own text set to your own specifications would be of assistance, contact me directly and I&rsquo;d be happy to discuss options.</p>
