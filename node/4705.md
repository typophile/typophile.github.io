  body: Those books are for me, the gifts for my professors are Type Spaces &#40;Peter
    Burnhill&#41; and Letterletter &#40;Gerrit Noordzij&#41;. Both of these professors
    have helped and encouraged me on my interests on type so I plan to give them a
    bit of what I have found on retribution. Those books are practically unknown here
    and I

  body: "I do not know these titles for your professor, but consider, as teachers,
    do they not have the same access to resources &#40;net&#41; and information as
    you?  <BR> <BR>My suggestion would be something from a gift book publisher such
    as Chronicle Books &#40;<a href=\"http://www.chroniclebooks.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.chroniclebooks.com</a>&#41;.
    I did a quick search and found: \t <BR> <BR>Window Seat <BR>Reading the Landscape
    from the Air <BR>&#34;Talk about a fresh perspective! Perched 35,000 feet in the
    air, Window Seat decodes the sights to be seen on any flight across North America.
    Broken down by region, this unusual guide features 70 aerial photographs; a fold-out
    map of North America showing major flight paths; profiles of each region covering
    its landforms, waterways, and cities; tips on spotting major sights, such as the
    Northern Lights, the Grand Canyon, and Disney World; tips on spotting not-so-major
    sights such as prisons, mines, and Interstates; and straightforward, friendly
    text on cloud shapes, weather patterns, the continent&#39;s history, and more.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Spotting manual for air travel? Full of graphic possibilities! That&#39;s
    my attitude for a gift, unless they said they want such and such."
