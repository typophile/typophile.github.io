body: How tall should [[text figures|OSF]] be? (I'm talking about 0, 1 and 2.) Should
  they be same size as small caps cap-height or lowercase x-height?

    \r\n\r\nOf most OSF that I've seen, they tend to have the short numbers slightly
    taller than the lowercase x-height, which sometimes is equal to the small-caps
    height, but those may not be available for comparison. "

  body: 'Chris, I know you said they looked too small but do you know why, i.e. what
    were they small against? Was it because you''re used to the small caps being very
    slightly bigger? I am trying to get to a good reason rather than your being conditioned
    over time by being exposed to common usage. "They just looked wrong" somehow doesn''t
    cut it for me:  I''m way too inquisitive. Plus how something looks is very subjective.
    This is a bigger discussion - Is the way something looks all there is to type
    design?'

  body: "Nick,\r\nThink of it like overshoot. The human eye/mind percieves the \"O\"
    as being off the baseline compared to an \"L\" for example. You can delve into
    what it is about human sight which makes this true but nevertheless, it is. You
    may even spend months figuring out a complex formula to tell you how much overshoot
    is correct--if you like that sort of thing. The trouble is, you can do it by eye
    much quicker so why bother? As I've said for years, the eye is the final arbitor.
    \r\nI am not saying that \"how it looks is all there is\" but if you are looking
    for some absolute measure to define perfect placement or proportion, you are about
    to spend a lot longer looking for a formula than you would just designing type.
    You have to ask yourself which interests you the most, the pursuit of a definitive
    infallible answer, or designing a library of type. \r\n\r\n\"how something looks
    is very subjective\"\r\nTo some degree but not really as mystical as you might
    think--there is a range of acceptable tolerance that most people fall within (again,
    think overshoot). There is optical correction involved in all joins and stem widths
    vs horizontals. You can create a statistical measure of \"how much\" is right
    and use the mean. Then create a ratio based on this for every weight, slant, degree
    of width, contrast and style or you can train your eye to see. It is up to you.
    You must realize that your audience does not use your formula, they just quickly
    use their eyes. You can jump up and down and stamp your feet if a user disagrees
    with your measure and point to your formula as proof. This will not change the
    users impression one bit. Renners drawings for Futura were originally quite geometric
    but had to be optically corrected quite a bit (some by him and some by the foundry)
    to look correct to humans.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: \"why, i.e. what were they
    small against?\"\r\n\r\nthe lowercase letters."

  body: "Thanks Chris, you are, of course, a gentleman and a scholar.\r\n\r\nI won't
    waste my time (or anyone else's) on formulae believe me, nevertheless I want to
    know why some fonts go for OSF that are lc x-ht and some that are sc X-ht. There
    must be some rationale behind both. They can't both 'look right' (can they?) Does
    a rationally good reason ever supercede (or at least subdue) the eye as the \"final
    arbiter\"?\r\n\r\nNo prizes for guessing that I view type design as a science
    more so that some who view it as an art. Maybe (I hope) my fonts will function
    better than someone else's which may  look nicer (although looking nice is a very
    subjective criterion - functionality is less subjective). Though for me function
    and aesthetics are very closely related."

  body: "I think you may misunderstand what working by eye does. It is not all about
    what looks better aesthetically. It is also about what works better to a reader.
    The use of science or human senses to create type are both attempting to produce
    functional type. They are not mutually exclusive. Think of the eye as a measuring
    device loaded with an algorithm that seeks to measure form in the most functional
    way for other human eyes. \r\n\r\nChrisL"

    knowledge about extender distribution in typical text.\r\n\r\nI've concluded that
    for running text the best system is usually where the \"x-height\" of the numerals
    is quite high; these are typically called \"hybrid\" numerals, and they were used
    on occasion as far back as the 18th century IIRC; and some designers (like De
    Groot) do it regularly today. I also firmly believe that the 3 and 5 (and maybe
    even the 2) should ascend, but that's a harder sell.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the OSF with small caps at all since they are arguably unrelated forms.\r\n\r\nI

  body: "> why is it that the OSF look small against lowercase?\r\n\r\nProbably because
    their extenders are more modest - they curl and taper.\r\n\r\nAlthough not \"related\"
    to smallcaps, the reason I think it can make sense to have the numeral ascenders*
    line up with the smallcaps is that, all else being equal, it's useful to line
    things up. Think of something like \"MI6\" for example. If they're coming close,
    snap them together (unless you're making a grunge font I guess).\r\n\r\n* Or,
    in a lining system, the top of the numerals.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I prefer my small caps and old style figures to be a bit taller than the x-height
    mainly because it makes them easier to distinguish from the lowercase letters
    in text. The idea for using small caps and old style figures in text is so that
    numbers and acronyms don't disrupt the flow and even color of the text, but I
    think they do still need to be somewhat distinct from the lowercase.
