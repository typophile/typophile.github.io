  perhaps someone could point me in the right direction if it isn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nI
  have to produce a Greek report where the required font is Frutiger LT 45 Light.
  I understand there was a Frutiger LT Greek a few years ago. Does anyone know where
  I can purchase this?\r\n\r\nIf not, can anyone recommend a Greek font that looks
  very similar and where I may purchase that? Many thanks.\r\n"

    years ago (which won a TDC2 prize) is not yet available, there is no \"Frutiger
    Greek\" you can use (although the regular Frutiger has a Cyrillic, it does not
    have Greek).\r\n\r\nMyriad and Segoe are in similar veins to Frutiger\u2014humanist
    sans\u2014or at least that is what many people seem to say. They both have Greeks,
    though, so you could check them out. Depending on your system and or software,
    you may already have these fonts installed anyway."

  body: "Oh, you asked where you can buy them, too. Here are links to <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1257/myriad-family.html\">Myriad</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.ascendercorp.com/msfonts/segoeUI.html\">Segoe</a>. \r\n\r\nThe
    Myriad fonts on the site that I linked to include Greek in their character sets.
    If you want to license Segoe, I think you have to e-mail Ascender at via the link
    on the page I linked to.\r\n\r\nNote that some Myriad fonts come with many Adobe
    and applications, and the OpenType Pro versions have Greek. Also, Segoe is the
    system font on Windows Vista, so if you are running current Windows, you should
    have that."
