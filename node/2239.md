body: 'I&#39;m working on a project for a senior class at my school. The project is
  about typography and fine art. I&#39;m designing three alphabets and painting them
  onto a canvas, to make the point that typography is a fine art.  <BR> <BR>My professor
  is asking that we find ten &#39;contemporary&#39; artists that are doing what we&#39;re
  doing. So do any of you know of people who are treating type as a fine art. ie incorporating
  it into painting, sculpture or anything like that. Something beyond simply designing
  a font.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve looked around and I haven&#39;t really seen much of this,
  but if you know of anyone who is doing this I&#39;d greatly appreciate your input.  <BR>
  <BR>If you have any questions about what I mean exactly feel free to ask as well.
  Thanks! '
