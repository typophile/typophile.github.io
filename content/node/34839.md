  twice a week, tabloid, established in 19th century) and I'm searching for a headline
  font. My favorites so far are [[http://www.typography.com/catalog/whitneycondensed/index.html|Whitney
  condensed]] and [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=amplitude|Amplitude]], although
  its big ink traps bother me. \r\n\r\nProperties for headline font are \"humane\"
  and \"contemporary\", but because this is a newspaper with long history and traditional
  image, it shouldn't be TOO contemporary... you know the story. Condensed version
  would be nice. \r\n\r\nIf you have any further suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
  Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n(for body text I've thought of Mercury Text, but that's
  only if I manage to convince paper to give up their Utopia...)"

    of the typographic space between the text face and the logo. Though I have no
    doubt that others may help you, it would be guessing for me to recommend anything
    without that knowledge, \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: Whitney Condensed + Mercury Text seems to be a really good choice, you don't
    want a serif headline font isn't it ?

  body: "Christian Schwartz has actually done a version of Amplitude without the extreme
    trapping for use in newspaper headlines. You can find examples at his site: <a
    href=\"http://www.christianschwartz.com/amphead.shtml\" target=new>http://www.christianschwartz.com/amphead.shtml</a>.
    The fonts are available through the Font Bureau Studio Library.\r\n\r\nIt sounds
    like you're looking for a sans serif design. But if you're open to considering
    a serif face, you might also look at the Whitman Display series, which was originally
    designed for newspaper commissions. It is currently used by the <a href=\"http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=MN_ST&ref_pge=lst\"
    target=new><cite>Minneapolis Star Tribune,</cite></a> the <a href=\"http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=WA_NT&ref_pge=lst\"
    target=new><cite>Tacoma News Tribune,</cite></a> and the <cite>Idaho Statesman.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    family has been recently expanded to 7 weights in 3 widths. I posted a few previews
    in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33419\" target=new>this other thread</a>
    on a magazine redesign. The fonts are not available in Retail release just yet
    (we're working on it). But you can contact the <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com\"
    target=new>Font Bureau</a> for licensing through their Studio Library.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "Thank you for suggestions! \r\n\r\nAnd yes, I'm looking for a sans serif
    headline. The newspaper in question has used only serif headlines so far and they
    want to take a little distance to their oldish, conservative image.\r\n\r\nkentlew:
    Beautiful, Amplitude Headline is pretty much just what I'm looking for...! It
    has edge, but not too much. Its rectangular and round forms make a nice dynamic
    contrast. It's definitely contemporary, but you can imagine it doesn't get dated
    too soon. Thanks!\r\n\r\nkuroneko: Mercury and Whitney condensed is nice, only
    thing that bugs me with Whitney is that its angular cut ends have a little too
    much personality to my taste. Especially words with k's (we have a lot of them
    in Finnish) tend to look jumpy and unbalanced.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else has suggestions
    of headlines with similarity to Whitney Condensed and Amplitude Headline, I'd
    love to hear them.\r\n\r\nBTW: I'm also redesigning their logo, so I can modify
    its forms based on typographic choices I make."

  body: "I'll suggest <a href=http://www.typography.net/type/shaker.htm>Shaker</a>
    from Jeremy Tankard. I recently bought it for my newspaper's redesign as a caption/sidebar
    font. I have to say that I'm not 100% pleased with how it mixes with Farnham and
    Merucry, the other typefaces (I think the difference in x-height between them
    irritates me), but I really liked it when I tried it in headlines as a demo. The
    italic is especially nice, IMO; I used it for a temporary nameplate while our
    final one was in the works.\r\n\r\nSince you said no serifs, I'll interpret that
    as not including slab-serifs and point out a few modern ones: <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Dispatch>Dispatch</a>
    (and its sans, <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Stainless>Stainless</a>), <a

    much. If you'd like to explore the possibility of custom type please get in touch:

    costs might be much more reasonable than you suspect.\r\n\r\n* Usually one limits
    the timeframe, but a clever possibility here would be limiting it to exclusivity
    for publications in Finland, or Finnish-language newspapers worldwide, etc.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
