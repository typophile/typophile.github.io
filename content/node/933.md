  or any of those &#34;naughty&#34; words, couldn&#39;t there be an option to turn
  censoring off? I don&#39;t find any mention of it in the preferences. Personally
  I think those big red bullets are rather annoying, anyone else agree?

    scripts could be tweaked so they come out as &amp;$@#! instead, like in the comics.
    That would be &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; great. :-&#41;

  body: Having never used this feature before, we&#39;d probably want to apply some
    style to the edit text, namely italicize and possibly drop a point size or two.
    Personally I think it clutters the message flow, which is the same reason why
    we don&#39;t use signatures on this board either.
