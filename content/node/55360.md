  Mahalia Jackson, Easter Sunday, Philharmonic Hall, Lincoln Center.\r\nThis piece
  is designed by Graphic Designer, Milton Glaser. It is an offset lithograph. I really
  like the designer's use of vibrant color to bring life to the poster. While looking
  through Milton Glaser's work, I found that his use of vibrant color is apparent
  in most of his work. His designs are very visually intriguing, and the viewer's
  eye is constantly moving over the design."

    he is an illustrator. This poster uses Glaser''s own typeface, Baby Teeth, inspired
    by a hand-painted sign he saw in Mexico. '
