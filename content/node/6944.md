  redesign a logo for a sports-company. the color black/red and the subline &#34;germany&#34;
  were given. what do you, typophiles think about icon and typo?  <BR> <BR>ps: the
  original icon was also a twisted &#34;metal&#34;-band.  <BR>the typography is a
  raw sketch for a first impression. <BR> <BR>thanks, romesh <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/50212.gif"

  body: 'Hi romesh, <BR> <BR>this is a nicely sportive and powerful logo. <BR> <BR>Instead
    of going into typographic details &#40;I find, for instance, the <b>G</b> in <i>Germany</i>
    too light and hence would make its arm longer; I&#39;d also fine tune the letterspacing
    in <i>Germany</i>&#41;, I&#39;ll just tell you my first overall impression: the
    icon itself, being a letter, has a distinctive typographic quality of its own,
    competing with the equally strong Sagim/Germany typeface. <BR> <BR>I do clearly
    see that, striving for typographic integrity, you&#39;ve designed the <b>S</b>
    icon as a variation of the Sagim typeface. But, for me, there&#39;s still too
    much &#34;typographic power&#34;. <BR> <BR>Since it may be quite subjective, I&#39;d
    be interested in knowing whether anyone shares this impression of mine. <BR> <BR>While
    realizing that another typeface would only add to what I think is a slight typographic
    overload, I&#39;d possibly like to see <i>Germany</i> in another &#40;more conservative/generic&#41;
    typeface than <i>Sagim</i>. <BR> <BR>Regards <BR>jpg'

  body: Romesh, please explain how they intend to use the logo. Is it a Nike type
    thing or is it only going to be small? Will the S ever be used alone? Is it for
    clothing or equipment, or both?

  body: the logo will be printed on different products e.g. tools, watches etc.  <BR>only
    the &#34;s&#34; should work alone.  I&#39;ll have to make a second version for
    a small usage.
