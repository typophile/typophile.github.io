body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI recently worked on branding a new furniture store in India.
  The branding involved creating large showroom panels that depicted lifestyle, furniture
  usage, materials etc. Considerable research went into the conceptualisation and
  I came up with precise copy and taglines. The panels were approved, fabricated and
  put up. But now two months past my invoice date, to my surprise, my client claims
  copy is not chargeable.   \r\n\r\nAnd I quote \r\n<blockquote>\"PLEASE NOTE COPYWRITING
  IS ALWAYS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ANY CREATIVE - AND NO AGENCY CHARGES EXTRA FOR COPYWRITING
  - CAN A CREATIVE BE PRESENTED TO A CLIENT WITHOUT COPYWRITING & TAGLINE AND PAY
  JUST FOR IMAGES THAT ARE PRESENTED CREATIVELY???\"\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nCan this
  be true? If the client has no concept, no brand proposition and the designer comes
  up with a credible one, is it not chargeable? Your comments.\r\n \r\n"

    you made with your client before you started the project.\r\nNormally there is
    written down an allocation of responsibilities between the two parties, the more
    exact the better. Was copywriting an integral part of the project contract? \r\n\r\nThe
    normal tactics of clients is pushing towards new jobs during a incomplete described
    project without paying extra. Alarm bells start ringing in my head. There should
    be a renegotiation about every \"new module\" be added during the process. It
    pays. \r\n\r\nThe game: Fully-qualified traders against not-so-qualified traders
    (grafic designers). \r\n\r\n \r\n"

    that he is waking up to this only now. The invoice has been due now for over 2
    months. "

    paste that part of the contract and send it back to them. Their best argument
    would then be that they didn't read the contract, which isn't much of an argument. "

    listed as a separate item on your contract (or estimate), and did they approve
    it prior to the start of work? \r\n\r\nCopyrighting is normally a billable charge,
    but it would give you a stronger case if it was specifically mentioned in your
    contract.\r\n"

  body: "It seems that at one or more points there has been a confusion between copywriting
    (writing copy text) and copyright (intellectual property rights).\r\n\r\nIt is
    true that copyright is integral to any creative work whether it is registered
    or not, but \"copyrighting\" described as an action can only mean registering
    the copyright, which if you choose to do so will incur fees that may be included
    in expenses.\r\n\r\nAlso, the copyright integral to the work is <em>yours,</em>
    and it is possible to buy it off of you with a clear contract, which should involve
    serious money because it would be signing away your own claim of creation. But
    all the client should really need is the trademark, which is different and belongs
    to the business it represents.\r\n\r\nIf your client actually thinks that you
    can't charge for writing copy, then he is simply dreaming up excuses not to pay
    for your work because he wants it free."

    to my post, it was just a spelling error. I meant \"copywriting\"."

    as being for copyright, based on the somewhat incoherent quote.
