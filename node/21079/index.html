  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

There's been similar discussions i'm sure, but I think its worth sparking up again...

Design doesn't lend itself to learning solo, but designers are increasingly out on their own performing their function in a solo freelance capacity, or as standalone 'design guys' performing specific design tasks in a bigger company.  I'm curious as to where other young designers are getting guidence, influence, assistance and support.  Ideally, a new designer might be working as a junior, in a larger team where they have access to senior designers for inspiration and guidance, but I know this isn't typically the case.

My scenario for example.  I'm two years graduated from a degree in Multimedia, where I was 'sufficiently' schooled in too broad a range of topics to be taken seriously in any one alone.  In the first year I worked on web projects with a technology company under an eccentric, bi-polar, Managing Director-cum-Creative Director.  Second year: Stand-alone 'design guy' (print/web) for a large multinational company serving the Corporate Affairs/Communications department part-time while also working as a freelance print/web designer where the majority of work involves designing/typesetting glorified classifieds, trade ads and the odd offset brochure.  

Where is my opportunity for mentorship in this arrangement? 
Is this a problem that a lot of other young designers are facing?
How are they handling it?

I for one am finding it very difficult.  Not so much for the mundane trade-ad type work, but anything that is the least bit challenging or unfamiliar can easily become a burden.  It's a little nerve racking to have no safety net.  Sometimes all that is required is the reassuring voice of a trusted senior that might say 'your on the right track, but maybe think about it like this...' or 'spot on, send to the client...'  Without this though, I feel like I'm driving blind, I have little confidence in my work and i'm doubting my ability to grow as a designer without some other input.

The folks here at typophile are great, and the critique forum is indispensible.  But lets be honest, it's no match for personal interation with a senior designer in a professional context - mentorship.

Maybe I should be looking to get in to a firm as a junior designer, but to be honest, i'm not the malleable, creative, art-school student who has potential if he learns how to use a computer.  I more fit the profile of that guy who knows enough about graphics, web technology and the AdobeCS to make things look professional.  

How can I grow as a designer in this environment?  
Does it just take time?  

Obviously the work I'm doing at the moment is okay, or I wouldn't be surviving as a freelancer. I just cant figure out how to get to the next step, or at least be confident in what i'm doing.  I'm starting to get rather discouraged and secretly entertaining the idea of another profession.

Any thoughts muchly appreciated.  I'd especially like to hear how those facing similar circumstances handled it.

Cheers - Jonny Schneider</div>

The most <strong>practical</strong> path is one you blew off: being a junior designer -- junior to someone who has been in the business long enough NOT to feel threatened by you, and willing to offer help as it's needed.

Otherwise, join a club -- most large cities have professional designers' clubs, users groups, etc. Besides being avenues for career advancement, they also offer the opportunity to talk shop with other pros in your field.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jonny,
I guess the truth is that getting the right mix of critique and encouragement mix is tough to manage under fire in a business situation. In the old days, there was more of an apprenticeship situation with design firms having larger staffs. Today, things are jobbed out so that "under someone's wing" feeling gets lost. 
There is something good about struggling through something on your own though. You become self-reliant and tougher in the process.  This is not easy and filled with frustration.  I am a firm believer that frustration is needed to make you push yourself.  The rewards are greater having done it.

		<div class="commentbody">Did your degree in multimedia concentrate on conceptual issues, or techincal ones? Most likely the latter, right? So the question is have you really been trained as a designer? Your comment about not being a malleable, creative, art school type speaks volumes. No one cares about art school, but malleable and creative are desireable traits.

You could continue to entertain and perhaps act upon those ideas of another profession, or you could sit down and read Phillip Meggs "A History of Graphic Design" from cover to cover and get a grip on what graphic design is and who does it.

There are no mentors, you are all alone. Get used to it.

Design is the new acting. How bad do you want it?</div>

Old Nick: 
Good idea.  It shouldn't be too hard to find a bunch of like minded people.  I live in Melbourne.  Plenty big enough with strong design culture.

Dezcom: 
Agreed, there's definitely credit in sweating it out on your own, and it does make you tougher.  This is what i've been doing to this point, and there is definitely a sense of achievement when you think in terms of what you have become as a direct result of your own effort and perseverence.  It's good, only its hard, sometimes very hard.  If I knew it was like this for everyone facing similar circumstances, I might feel a little better.  From the replies so far, it sounds as though i'm not alone.

Terminaldesign: 
Multimedia degree attempted to be conceptual and technical.  To its credit, studies in Typography and some other subjects were very conceptual and taught from the College of Art attached to the university.  Having said that, the majority of the program belonged to the Information Technology faculty, and so concentrated on technical issues.

Thanks for the book reference.  It seems to come highly recommended. I'll probably hit the local design book shop for a look shortly.

Cheers - Jonny
