  knows this one here. First thought was of Dave Wests Behemoth, perhaps with an outline??
  Or is there another similar font that i just failed to recognize. Giza??\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    suggestion is a good choice. A little extra stroke thickness would do it, I think.
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/quadra-57-bq/|Quadra 57]] was the other
    font I looked at, but the serifs are not bracketed.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    very close.It would be hard to tell it from the sample, I think. Good find Renko.\r\n\r\n-
