How do veteran typographers select appropriate fonts for myriad applications? For example; what resources would be used, what research would be done to choose a typeface for:

-a 2010 film from Thailand?
-a Canadian movie about WWI?
-a french play based in 1814?

Although I understand the importance of selecting appropriate fonts. (Where was the type designer born/raised, are they a man or a woman, when was the typeface developed) I have no idea where to even START researching this stuff.

How do YOU do it?

This is important to your readers? what is important is that the reader gets the right feeling from the fonts, not the right biographical information on it's designer, I think. 

If you don't know these feelings, books are not going to help. You need to look at other font uses when designing for the same, or similar topics. </div>

http://www.typophile.com/node/78520

In the above post, I critiqued the font choice in the film, not its promotion. However, IIRC, the movie ads and posters started off with some other type than Gill, before switching to Gill. Perhaps the discussion here was a contributing factor.

Typophilers frequently mocked Hollywood's erstwhiile reliance on Trajan, and for the last year or so I've noticed that movie advertising has moved on from that generic era, becoming more sophisticated (like many areas of commercial design). It is indeed good times for contemporary typography. And using "historically correct" types is part of that picture.

<em>How do YOU do it?</em>

Consult mass media from the era and region.
 Matt McGrew's "American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century" (Oak Knoll) will help identify the fonts used, at least in North America, so for e.g. Canadian WWI, Saturday Evening Post would be most promising. Sure, it was a US publication, not Canadian, but it had a huge Canadian distribution, and it's easy to get hold of old copies.</div>

For me in order to pick a font for any of the above mentioned movies I would have to watch the movie first to better understand the characters and stories.

For example the font could just capture the main character or the spirit of the movie line. Sorry for not giving you a specific font suggestion, but there are many different ways to go about this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">nskyers, first keep in mind that historical accuracy of fonts is not exactly the highest priority for a movie director, just as they might not care if a character's costume, hairstyle, language -- or even the movie as a whole -- isn't historically accurate in every detail. 

They're going for a look that communicates the general time and place to modern audiences, and if the details aren't right only a tiny percentage of people will know or care.  

Graphics used in the movie itself (a store sign, for example) are normally prepared under the supervision of the movie's production designer. As reference they may assemble historical photos from various sources like the internet, museums, library books, field trips, etc.

Graphics used in marketing materials (like a movie poster) are often prepared by a different group -- the studio's art department (or farmed out to an outside design firm); sometimes with the director having some input and sometimes not. My guess is that historical accuracy in marketing materials is a fairly low priority. </div>

History is always being looked at through the lens of 'right now' anyway, so 100 years from now when there is a movie about a typographer in 2011 making a poster for a film which is the story of a 1970's film studio endeavoring to shoot a film about the early 19th century discovery of Gold by the Dutch in Johannesburg... what will you do?

In Robert Bringhurst's 'The Elements of Typographic Style v3.1' chapter 6.3.1 he describes the kind of discord that I'm addressing with this question.

Although my original examples were for film and theater marketing, that's not the only medium I'm concerned about here. I'm talking about avoiding contradiction when typesetting anything.

It's been said (by Bob Stacey) that JEH Macdonald, who was an accomplished lettering artist and had a stellar career in commercial art in the early years of the 20th century, as well as being founder of the Group of Seven, would have designed very Goudy-ish typefaces—had there been a Canadian type foundry producing original designs at the time.
http://www.penumbrapress.com/book.php?id=86

Sure, Cartier was the "first" Canadian type design, but the prolific Les Usherwood was not long after — his faces absolutely nail the look of 1970s and 1980s Canada. From 1990 there have been plenty of Canadian digital fonts, for instance Mambo and Fontesque were massive in the mid 1990s and typical of the era.
