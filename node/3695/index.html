  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Typophiles - <BR>I am new to this board, so let me introduce myself before I ask for your help.  I am attending college at Kansas State University in&hellip;.Kansas (go figure).  Graduation is scheduled for the fall of '05, although I am considering pursuing Graduate school.  I am an avid mountain biker and soccer player.  <BR> <BR>For the last few days I have been pondering about creating a logo to use for promoting and identifying myself.  I work on a medium amount of freelance projects, and I thought it would be nice to have something to put on a business card when I am networking with people (i.e. drunken shmoozing) <BR> <BR>In the back of my head I would like to steer this towards being a pretty strong graphic symbol, that I could then apply variations to in the form of ornamentation/texture.  The thing that really got this all started was a discussion about printers marks - <BR>here is a link to some&hellip;<a href="http://www.lib.iastate.edu/art/printmk.html">printers marks</a>.  I think I would like to base it around my intitials in some form, but you have any other suggestion let me know.

		<div class="commentbody">I like it. Maybe because it's open to interpretation, but there's clearly some mutual movement (communication) going on. <BR> <BR>I might make it more compact though, and add some irragularity, like in that St Albans Mark - or like the Koch symbols: flares at the ends of strokes and somewhat &quot;off&quot; arrowheads, although it's not easy to make that look intentional and not like a mistake. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

<li>on your point tiffany i can see where you say that it doesnt correlate with design directly or even obviously.  But to be honest I find that many time artists logos or designers logos are fairly obvious, i.e. a paintbrush.  While I think that this is excellent if done well, many times it is not.  I also tend to be more of an abstract thinker.  So it fits my personality&hellip; <BR> <BR>- hrant, i agree with what you say about adding irregularity.  I also think it is tough to make it seem intentional.  I am going to try a variation with more of a &quot;serifed&quot; feel to it.  By compact do you mean more of a even height and width? <BR> <BR>thanks for the suggestions guys.</li>
