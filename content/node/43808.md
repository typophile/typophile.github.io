body: "San Serriffe is a fictional island nation created for April Fools' Day, 1977,
  by staff members of Britain's Guardian newspaper. An elaborate description of the
  nation, using puns and plays on words relating to typography (such as \"sans serif\"),
  was reported as legitimate news, apparently fooling many readers who did not understand
  the joke and did not understand that there was a reason that the island was also
  known as Hoaxe. In more recent years knowledge of typography has spread through
  widespread use of computers, and so the jokes are much more likely to be spotted.\r\n\r\nThe
  first version of the hoax appeared in the British newspaper The Guardian on April
  1, 1977. A seven-page supplement was published in the style of contemporary reviews
  of foreign countries, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the island's independence,
  complete with themed advertisements from major companies. The island was reused
  for similar hoaxes in 1978, 1980 and 1999.\r\n\r\nThe original idea was to have
  it located in the Atlantic Ocean near Tenerife, but due to the ground collision
  of two Boeing 747s there a few days before publication, in the original Guardian
  newspaper report it was moved to the Indian Ocean, near the Seychelles Islands.\r\n\r\nSan
  Serriffe was one of the most famous and successful hoaxes of recent decades; it
  has become part of the common cultural heritage of literary humour, and a secondary
  body of literature has been derived from it. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Serriffe"
